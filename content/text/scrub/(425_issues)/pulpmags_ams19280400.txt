cash in on your
unrealized abilities

 psycho-analysis is remaking men
 and women lnlo glorious successes
 by enabling them lo find and
 cash in on their hidden powers
 for their own personal advancement

 yol  lim in life is to succeed you
 art fighting lay and night year in
 and year out to find a way out of the
 rit-a roadway that will lead you to greater
 happiness and success

    after all dollars and cents arc the stand-
 ards by which we judge the successful man
 and woman today and so dollars and cents
 are the conscious aim of most of us men and
 women from time immemorial have been
 struggling to make a place for themselves
 that would free them from economic slavery
 why is it  hat so many succeed in reaching
 thisgoal v-hile others seem to be left eternally
 fighting and struggling against an almost in-
 surmountable barrier what is the answer
 to the problem

your hidden self and its
startling power

   the ancient formula for success was
 know thyself modern science however
 has discovered a new answer to t his problem-
 know thine other self scientists have
 discovered that deep down within you hidden
 from all the world even from yourself lies
 buried a mysterious other self-a being of
 whose existence you have never thought-
 and yet who directs the whole destiny of
 vour life determining your failure or success

   since the dawn of history men have
 vaguely realized the existence of this strange
 dual nature this baffling
 two-in-oiie-ness of the hu-
 man mind- and it is this
 subconscious mind this
 other part of you which
 is in reality the determin-
 ing factor in the progress
 you make

 the veil drawn from
 your other self

    do you ever forget to
 do things that you in-
 tended to do do you
 find certain tasks dis-
 tasteful do you have
 unaccountable blue
 streaks are you inclined
 to be morbid-morose-
 unhappy do you ever
 feel as though the work
 you are doing is not suited
 to you do you ever long
 to engage in another line
 of work for which you be-
 lieve yourself better fitted
 yet havent the courage
 to make the change do
 you ever feel as though
 you never had a
 cnnnce
 i all of the above are
 questions suggested to you by your sub-
 conscious mind-the mind that is the motor
 behind your hidden forces of new enerny and
 vitality it is this subconscious mind that
 is waiting at your command to release the
 floodgates of this strange power that will lead
 you to wealth-health-and happiness

 often you dream strange impossible
 dreams they sometimes seem to you yet

 lifes thousand thrills

  life it capable of  thoumnd thrills joys and
  achievement of which the average peron
  never dreamt

 cult is solved you can read the answers to

 prize contest

 wanted a symbol for scientifiction

 by hugo gernsback

ver since we had our last prize contest last
year many of our readers have expressed the
wish to see another contest in this magazine
i have given the matter a great deal of
thought and i finally came to the following
 conclusion

coined the word scientifiction in  i knew
that sometime or other it was bound to become popular and
 even cherished a secret hope that some day it might appear
in a standard dictionary

  in any event scientifiction is a word that will grow with
the added years as science advances scientifiction will
advance and flourish no one of to-day can even dimly fore-
see what it may produce there was a time when science
made scientifiction the time lias already come when scienti-
fiction makes science the author who
works out a brand new idea in a
scientifiction plot may be hailed as an
original inventor years later when
his brain-child will have taken wings
and when cold-blooded scientists will
have realized the authors ambition

 an author may not know how to
build or make his invention of a cer-
tain apparatus or instrument but he
may know how to predict and often
does predict the use of such a one

the professional inventor or scientist
then comes along gets the stimulus
from the story and promptly responds
with the material invention it may
not always work out this way but it
is conceivable that it might in the fu-
ture the reason is that inventors and scientists as a rule
have their noses close to the grindstone whereas it takes an
author with vision to sec ahead and so to start others thinking
along new lines the inventor or scientist may not always
admit the truth of this but the fact nevertheless remains
that both are susceptible to all sorts of outside influences
more than they will admit even to themselves

  the thought occurred to me therefore that what scienti-
fiction needs at present is some sort of a label-an emblem
or a trade-mark so to speak scientifiction is too good a
thing just to be used as a word in mere letters it should
have some dignity and the idea itself of scientifiction should
have its own crest henceforth

  after i had come to this pass i sat down and composed
the design that now adorns the front cover of this issue
not being a draftsman or an artist i explained my idea to

 in prizes

first prize  
second prize     
third prize     
fourth prize     
fifth and sixth prize       
each        
seventh-tenth each      
tion is pictured exactly what it is the big eye represents
the minds eye within that eye you have in a pictorial
presentation everything that is represented by scientifiction

i admit that many of our readers could give the world a
much better representation of the word scientifiction
which is what this contest is all about

  amazing stories will pay  in prizes for the best
representation of the word scientifiction a design-a
coat-of-arms-a flag-an emblem or whatever you may call
it is wanted for scientifiction whatever it is there must
be no question as to the meaning of the design it must be
self-explanatory-it must be descriptive of scientifiction
now do not jump to the conclusion that this contest is only
for artists or designers it is not the idea can either le
sketched in black and white or in colors or in case you do
neither you can merely type the idea
out on a sheet of paper only giving
your conception of what the emblem
should be such an entry will be just
as valid as any submitted by amateur
artists

  please note the following rules

  	a design representing the word
scientifiction is wanted

  	the design must be descriptive
of the idea of scientifiction

  	the idea can be sketched in
pencil ink oil colors or water colors
or the idea may be typewritten on a
sheet of paper without any sketches
all will be equally eligible

  	no design is to be larger than
x inches designs must be de-
livered flat not rolled

  	penciled matter will not be considered

  	the publishers reserve the right to publish any de-
sign not having won a prize by paying regular space rales
to contestants

  	from this contest are excluded all employees of the
experimenter publishing company and members of their
families

  	this contest closes on may   and all entries
must be received by noon of that day prize-winning an-
nouncements will be made in our july issue

  	if similar designs or ideas as submitted should tie for
a prize the identical prize will be paid to all contestants

a story of the
d w is to come

by gwells

   author of the time machine the island of doctor moreau etc

chapter i
the cure for love

ent mr morris was an english-
 lie lived in the days of queen
the good lie was a prosper-
very sensible man he read the
nd went to church and as he
grew towards middle age an expression of quiet
contented contempt for all who were not as himself
settled on his face he was one of those people
who do everything that is right and proper and sensi-
ble with inevitable regularity he always wore just
the right and proper clothes steering the narrow
way between the smart and the shabby always sub-
scribed to the right charities just the judicious com-
promise between ostentation and meanness and never
failed to have his hair cut to exactly the proper
length

  everything that it was right and proper for a
man in his position to possess he possessed and
everything that it was not right and proper for a
man in his position to possess he did not possess

  and among other right and proper possessions
this mr morris had a wife and children they were
the right sort of wife and the right sort and number
of children of course nothing imaginative or highty-
flighty about any of them so far as mr morris
could see they wore perfectly correct clothing
neither smart nor hygienic nor faddy in any way but
just sensible and they lived in a nice sensible house
in the later victorian sham
queen anne style of
architecture with sham
half-timbering of choco-
late-painted plaster in the
gables lincrusta walton
sham carved oak panels a
terrace of terra cotta to
imitate stone and cathe-
dral glass in the front
door his boys went to
good solid schools and
were put to respectable
professions his girls in
spite of a fantastic protest or so were all married
to suitable steady oldish young men with good
prospects and when it was a fit and proper thing
for him to do so mr morris died his tomb was
of marble and without any art nonsense or lauda-
tory inscription quietly imposing-such being the
fashion of his time

  he underwent various changes according to the
accepted customs in these cases and long before
this story begins even his bones had become dust
and were scattered to the four quarters of heaven

and his sons and his grandsons and his great-grand-
sons and his great-great-grandsons they too were
dust and ashes and were scattered likewise it was
a thing he could not have imagined that a day would
come when even his great-great-grandsons would be
scattered to the four winds of heaven if any one
had suggested it to him he would have resented it
he was one of those worthy people who take no
interest in the future of mankind at all lie had
grave doubts indeed ii there was any future for
mankind after he was dead

  it seemed quite impossible and quite uninteresting
to imagine anything happening after he was dead
yet the thing was so and when even his great-great-
grandson was dead and decayed and forgotten when
the sham half-timbered house had gone the way of
all shams and the times was extinct and the silk
hat a ridiculous antiquity and the modestly impos-
ing stone that had been sacred to mr morris had
been burnt to make lime for mortar and all that
mr morris had found real and important was sere
and dead the world was still going on and people
were still going about it just as heedless and im-
patient of the future or indeed of anything but
their own selves and property as mr morris had

  and strange to tell and much as mr morris
would have been angered if any one had fore-
shadowed it to him all over the world there were
scattered a multitude of people filled with the breath
of life in whose veins the blood of mr morris
flowed just as some day
the life which is gathered

was one almost as sensi-

ancestor he had just the
same stout short frame as that ancient man of the
nineteenth century from whom his name of morris
-he spelt it mwres-came he had the same half-
contemptuous expression of face he was a pros-
perous person too as times went and he disliked
the new-fangled and bothers about the future and
the lower classes just as much as the ancestral mor-
ris had ddne he did not read the times indeed

machine that talked to him as he made his toilet
of a morning might have been the voice of a rein-
carnated blowitz when it dealt with the worlds
affairs this phonographic machine was the size
and shape of a dutch clock and down the front
of it were electric barometric indicators and an elec-
tric clock and calendar and automatic engagement
reminders and where the clock would have been
was the mouth of a trumpet when it had news
the trumpet gobbled like a turkey galloop galloop
and then brayed out its message as let us say a
trumpet might bray it would tell mwres in full
rich throaty tones about the overnight accidents to
the omnibus flying-machines that plied around the
world the latest arrivals at the fashionable resorts
in tibet and of all the great monopolist company
meetings of the day before while he was dressing
if mwres did not like hearing what it said he had
only to touch a stud and it would choke a little and
talk about something else

  of course his toilet differed very much from
that of his ancestor it is doubtful which would
have been the more shocked and pained to find him-
self in the clothing of the other mwres would cer-
tainly have sooner gone forth to the world stark
naked than in the silk hat frock coat grey trousers
and watch-chain that had filled mr morris with
sombre self-respect in the past for mwres there
was no shaving to do a skilful operator had long
ago removed every hair-root from his face his
legs he encased in pleasant pink and amber garments
of an nir-tight material which with the help of an
ingeu-uts little pump he distended so as to suggest
enormous muscles above this he also wore pneu-
matic garments beneath an amber silk tunic so that
he was clothed in air and admirably protected against
sudden extremes of heat or cold over this he flung
a scarlet cloak with its edge fantastically curved on
his head which had been skilfully deprived of every
scrap of hair he adjusted a pleasant little cap of
bright scarlet held on by suction and inflated with
hydrogen and curiously like a comb of a cock so
his toilet was complete and conscious of being
soberly and becomingly attired he was ready to face
his fellow-beings with a tranquil eve

this mwres-the civility of mr had vanished
ages ago-was one of the officials under the
wind vane and waterfall trust the great company
that owned every wind wheel and waterfall in the
world and which pumped all the water and supplied
all the electric energy that people in these latter days
required he lived in a vast hotel near that part
of london called seventh way and had very large
and comfortable apartments on the seventeenth floor
households and family life had long since disap-
peared with the progressive refinement of manners
and indeed the steady rise in rents and land values
the disappearance of domestic servants the elabora-
tion of cookery had rendered the separate domicile
of victorian times impossible even had any one de-
sired such a savage seclusion when his toilet was
completed he went towards one of the two doors
of his apartment-there were doors at opposite
ends each marked with a huge arrow pointing one
one way and one the other-touched a stud to open
it and emerged on a wide passage the centre of
which bore chairs and was moving at a steady pace
to the left on some of these chairs gaily-dressed
men and women were seated he nodded to an ac-

quaintance-it was not in those days etiquette to
talk before breakfast-and seated himself on one
of these chairs and in a few seconds he had been
carried to the doors of a lift by which he descended
to the great and splendid hall in which his breakfast
would be automatically served

  it was a very different meal from a victorian
breakfast the rude masses of bread needing to be
carved and smeared over with animal fat before they
could be made palatable the still recognisable frag-
ments of recently killed animals hideously charred
and hacked the eggs torn ruthlessly from beneath
some protesting hen-such things as these though
they constituted the ordinary fare of victorian times
would have awakened only horror and disgust in the
refined minds of the people of these latter days in-
stead were pastes and cakes of agreeable and varie-
gated design without any suggestion in colour or
form of the unfortunate animals from which their
substance and juices were derived they appeared
on little dishes sliding out upon a rail from a little
box at one side of the table the surface of the
table to judge by touch and eye would have appeared
to a nineteenth-century person to be covered with
fine white damask but this was really an oxidised
metallic surface and could be cleaned instantly after
a meal there were hundreds of such little tables
in the hall and at most of them were other latter-
day citizens singly or in groups and as mwres
seated himself before his elegant repast the invisible
orchestra which had been resting during an interval
resumed and filled the air with music

  but mwres did not display any great interest
either in his breakfast or the music his eye wan-
dered incessantly about the hall as though he ex-
pected a belated guest at last he rose eagerly and
waved his hand and simultaneously across the hall
appeared a tall dark figure in a costume of yellow
and olive green as this person walking amidst the
tables with measured steps drew near the pallid
earnestness of his face and the unusual intensity of
his eyes became apparent mwres reseated himself
and pointed to a chair beside him

  i feared you would never come he said in
spite of the intervening space of time the english
language was still almost exactly the same as it had
been in england under victoria the good the in-
vention of the phonograph and such like means of
recording sound and the gradual replacement of
books by such contrivances had not only saved the
human eyesight from dccay but had also by the
establishment of a sure standard arrested the process
of change in accent that had hitherto been so in-
evitable

  i was delayed by an interesting case said the
man in green and yellow a prominent politican-
ahem-suffering from overwork he glanced at
the breakfast and seated himself  have been
awake for forty hours

  eh dear said mwres fancy that you hyp-
notists have your work to do

  the hypnotist helped himself to some attractive
amber-coloured jelly i happen to be a good deal
in request he said modestly

  heaven knows what we should do without you

  oh were not so indispensable as all that said
the hypnotist ruminating the flavour of the jelly
the world did very well without us for some thou-
sands of years two hundred years ago even-not
one in practice that is physicians by the thou-
a story of the days to come



sand of course-frightfully clumsy brutes for the
most part and following one another like sheep-
but doctors of the mind except a few empirical
flounderers there were none

  he concentrated his mind on the jelly

tct ut were people so sane- began mwres

  x the hypnotist shook his head it didnt
matter then if they were a bit silly or faddy life
was so easy-going then no competition worth
speaking of-no pressure a human being had to be
very lopsided before anything happened then you
know they clapped em away in what they called a
lunatic asylum

  i know said mwres in these confounded
historical romances that every one is listening to
they always rescue a beautiful girl from an asylum
or something of the sort i dont know if you attend
to that rubbish

   must confess i do said the hypnotist it
carries one out of ones self to hear of those quaint
adventurous half-civilized days of the nineteenth
century when men were stout and women simple i
like a good swaggering story before all things curi-
ous times they were with their smutty railways and
puffing old iron trains their rum little houses and
their horse vehicles i suppose you dont read
books 

  dear no said mwres i went to a modern
school and we had none of that old-fashioned non-
sense phqnographs are good enough for me

  of course said the hypnotist of course and
surveyed the table for his next choice you know
he said helping himself to a dark blue confection
that promised well in those days our business was
scarcely thought of i daresay if any one had told
them that in two hundred years time a class of men
would be entirely occupied in impressing things upon
the memory effacing unpleasant ideas controlling
and overcoming instinctive but undesirable impulses
and so forth by means of hypnotism they would
have refused to believe the thing possible few peo-
ple knew that an order made during a mesmeric
trance even an order to forget or an order to desire
could be given so as to be obeyed after the trance
was over yet there were men alive then who could
have told them the thing was as absolutely certain
to come about as-well the transit of venus

  they knew of hypnotism then

  oh dear yes they used it-for painless den-
tistry and things like that this blue stuff is con-
foundedly good what is it

  havent the faintest idea said mwres but i
admit its very good take some more

  the hypnotist repeated his praises and there was
an appreciative pause

  speaking of these historical romances said
mwres with an attempt at an easy off-hand man-
ner brings me-ah-to the matter i-ah-had in
mind when i asked you-when i expressed a wish to
see you he paused and took a deep breath

  the hypnotist turned an attentive eye upon him
and continued eating

  the fact is said mwres i have a-in fact a-
daughter well you know i have given her-ah-
every educational advantage lectures-not a soli-
tary lecturer of ability in the world but she has had
a telephone direct dancing deportment conversa-
tion philosophy art criticism    he indicated

catholic culture by a gesture of his hand i had in-
tended her to marry a very good friend of mine-
bindon of the lighting commission-plain little
man you know and a bit unpleasant in some of his
ways but an excellent fellow reallv-an excellent
fellow

  yes said the hypnotist go on how old is
she

  eighteen

  a dangerous age well

  well it seems that she has been indulging in
these historical romances-excessively excessively
even to the neglect of her philosophy filled her
mind with unutterable nonsense about soldiers who
fight-what is it-etruscans

  egyptians

  egyptians-very probably hack about with
swords and revolvers and things-blood-shed galore
-horrible-and about young men on torpedo
catchers who blow up-spaniards i fancy-and all
sorts of irregular adventurers and she has got it
into her head that she must marry for love and
that poor little bindon-

  ive met similar cases said the hypnotist who
is the other young man

  mwres maintained an appearance of resigned calm
you may well ask he said he is-and his
voice sank with shame-a mere attendant upon the
stage on which the flying-machines from paris alight
he has-as they say in the romances-good looks
he is quite young and very eccentric affects the an-
tique-he can read and write so can she and
instead of communicating by telephone like sensible
people they write and deliver-what is it

  notes

  no-not notes    ah-poems

  the hypnotist raised his eyebrows how did she
meet him 

  tripped coming down from the flying-machine
from paris-and fell into his arms the mischief
was done in a moment

  yes

  well-thats all things must be stopped that
is what i want to consult you about what must be
done what can be done of course im not a
hypnotist my knowledge is limited but you-
hypnotism is not magic said the man in green
putting both arms on the table

  oh precisely but still-

  people cannot be hypnotised without their con-
sent if she is able to stand out against marrying
bindon she will probably stand out against being
hypnotised but if once she can be hypnotised-even
by somebody else-the thing is done

  you can-

  oh certainly once we get her amenable then
we can suggest that she must marry bindon-that
that is her fate or that the young man is repulsive
and that when she sees him she will be giddy and
faint or any little thing of that sort or if wecan
get her into a sufficiently profound trance we can-
suggest that she should forget him altogether-
precisely

  but the problem is to get her hypnotised of
course no sort of proposal or suggestion must come
from you-because no doubt she already distrusts
you in the matter

  the hypnotist leant his head upon his arm and
thought


amazing stories

tftts hard a man cannot dispose of his own

  jl daughter said mwres irrelevantly

  you must give me the name and address of the
young lady said the hypnotist and any informa-
tion bearing upon the matter and by the bye is
there any money in the affair 

  mwres hesitated

  theres a sum-in fact a considerable sum-in-
vested in the patent road company from her
mother thats what makes the thing so exasperat-
ing

  exactly said the hypnotist and he proceeded
to cross-examine mwres on the entire affair

   it was a lengthy interview

  and meanwhile elizebeth mwres as she spelt
her name or elizabeth morris as a nineteenth-cen-
tury person would have put it was sitting in a quiet
waiting-place beneath the great stage upon which
the flying-machine from paris descended and be-
side her sat her slender handsome lover reading her
the poem he bad written that morning while on duty
upon the stage when he had finished they sat for
a time in silence and then as if for their special en-
tertainment the great machine that had come flying
through the air from america that morning rushed
down out of the sky

   at first it was a little oblong faint and blue amidst
the distant fleecy clouds and then it grew swiftly
large and white and larger and whiter until they
could see the separate tiers of sails each hundreds of
feet wide and the lank body they supported and at
last even the swinging seats of the passengers in a
dotted row although it was falling it seemed to
them to be rushing up the sky and over the roof-
spaces of the city below its shadow leapt towards
them they heard the whistling rush of the air
about it and its yelling siren shrill and swelling to
warn those who were on its landing-stage of its ar-
rival and abruptly the note fell down a couple of
octaves and it had passed and the sky was clear
and void and she could turn her sweet eyes again
to denton at her side

  their silcnce ended and denton speaking in a
little language of broken english that was they
fancied their private possession-though lovers have
used such little languages since the world began-
told her how they too would leap into the air one
morning out of all the obstacles and difficulties about
them and fly to a sunlit city of delight he knew of
in japan half-way about the world

  she loved the dream but she feared the leap and
she put him off with some day dearest one some
day to all his pleading that it might be soon and
at last came a shrilling of whistles and it was time
for him to go back to his duties on the stage they
parted-as lovers have been wont to part for thou-
sands of years she walked down a passage to a
lift and so came to one of the streets of that latter-
day london all glazed in with glass from the
weather and with incessant moving platforms that
went to all parts of the city and by one of these
she returned to her apartments in the hotel for
women where she lived the apartments that were
in telephonic communication with all the best lec-
turers in the world but the sunlight of the flying
stage was in her heart and the wisdom of all the
best lecturers in the world seemed folly in that light

  she spent the middle part of the day in the gym-
nasium and took her midday meal with two other
girls and their common chaperone-for it was still

the custom to have a chaperone in the case of mother-
less girls of the more prosperous classes the chap-
erone had a visitor that day a man in green and
yellow with a white face and vivid eyes who talked
amazingly among other things he fell to praising
a new historical romance that one of the great pop-
ular story-tellers of the day had just put forth it
was of course about the spacious times of queen
victoria and the author among other pleasing novel-
ties made a little argument before each section of
the story in imitation of the chapter headings of the
old-fashioned books as for example how the cab-
men of pimlico stopped the victoria omnibuses and
of the great fight in palace yard and how the
piccadilly policeman was slain in the midst of his
duty the man in green and yellow praised this
innovation these pithy sentences he said are
admirable they show at a glance those headlong
tumultuous times when men and animals jostled in
the filthy streets and death might wait for one at
every corner life was life then how great the
world must have seemed then how marvellous
there were still parts of the world absolutely unex-
plored nowadays we have almost abolished won-
der  we lead lives so trim and orderly that courage
endurance faith all the noble virtues seem fading
from mankind

  and so on taking the girls thoughts with him
until the life they led life in the vast and intricate
london of the twenty-second century a life inter-
spersed with soaring excursions to every part of the
globe seemed to them a monotonous misery com-
pared with the daedal past

  at first elizabeth did not join in the conversa-
tion but after a time the subject became so inter-
esting that she made a few shy interpolations but
he scarcely seemed to notice her as he talked he
went on to describe a new method of entertaining
people they were hypnotised and then suggestions
were made to them so skilfully that they seemed to
be living in ancient times again they played out
a little romance in the past as vivid as reality and
when at last they awakened they remembered all
they had been through as though it were a real
thing

  it is a thing we have sought to do for years and
years said the hypnotist it is practically an arti-
ficial dream and we know the way at last think
of all it opens out to us-the enrichment of our ex-
perience the recovery of adventure the refuge it
offers from this sordid competitive life in which
we live think

  and you can do that said the chaperone eagerly
the thing is possible at last the hypnotist said
you may order a dream as you wish

  the chaperone was the first to be hypnotised and
the dream she said was wonderful when she came
to again

  the other two girls encouraged by her enthusiasm
also placed themselves in the hands of the hypnotist
and had plunges into the romantic past no one sug-
gested that elizabeth should try this novel entertain-
ment  it was at her own request at last that she was
taken into that land of dreams where there is neither
any freedom of choice nor will   

  and so the mischief was done

one day when denton went down to that quiet
seat beneath the flying stage elizabeth was not
in her wonted place he was disappointed and a
a story of the days to come



little angry the next day she did not come and the
next also he was afraid to hide his fear from
himself he set to work to write sonnets for her when
she should come again   

  for three days he fought against his dread by
such distraction and then the truth was before him
clear and cold and would not be denied she might
be ill she might be dead but he would not believe
that be had been betrayed there followed a week
of misery and then he knew she was the only thing
on earth worth having and that he must seek her
however hopeless the search until she was found
once more

  he had some small private means of his own and
so he threwover his appointment on the flying stage
and set himself to find this girl who had become
at last all the world to him lie did not know where
she lived and little of her circumstances for it had
been part of the delight of her girlish romance that
he should know nothing of her nothing of the dif-
ference of their station the ways of the city
opened before him east and west north and south
even in victorian days london was a maze that little
london with its poor four millions of people but the
london he explored the london of the twenty-
second century was a london of thirty million souls
at first he was energetic and headlong taking time
neither to eat nor sleep he sought for weeks and
months he went through every imaginable phase of
fatigue and despair over-excitement and anger
long after hope was dead by the sheer inertia of
his desire he still went to and fro peering into faces
and looking this way and that in the incessant ways
and lilts and passages of that interminable hive
of men

  at last chance was kind to him and he saw her

  it was in a time of festivity he was hungry he
had paid the inclusive fee and had gone into one of
the gigantic dining-places of the city he was pushing
his way among the tables and scrutinising by mere
force of habit every group he passed

  ile stood still robbed of all power of motion his
eyes wide his lips apart elizabeth sat scarcely
twenty yards away from him looking straight at
him her eyes were as hard to him as hard and
expressionless and void of recognition as the eyes
of a statue

  she looked at him for a moment and then her
gaze passed beyond him

  had he had only her eyes to judge by he might
have doubted if it were indeed elizabeth but he knew
her by the gesture of her hand by the grace of a
wanton little curl that floated over her ear as she
moved her head something was said to her and
she turned smiling tolerantly to the man beside her
a little man in foolish raiment knobbed and spiked
like some odd reptile with pneumatic horns-the
bindon of her fathers choice

  for a moment denton stood white and wild-eyed
then came a terrible faintness and he sat before one
of the little tables he sat down with his back to
her and for a time be did not dare to look at her
again when at last he did she and bindon and two
other people were standing up to go the others
were her father and her chaperone

  he sat as if incapable of action until the four
figures were remote and small and then he rose
possessed with the one idea of pursuit for a space
he feared he had lost them and then he came upon
elizabeth and her chaperone again in one of the

streets of moving platforms that intersected the city
bindon and mwres had disappeared

  he could not control himself to patience he
felt he must speak to her forthwith or die he
pushed forward to where they were seated and sat
down beside them his white face was convulsed
with half-hysterical excitement

  lie laid his hand on her wrist elizabeth he
said

  she turned in unfeigned astonishment nothing
but the fear of a strange man showed in her face

  elizabeth he cried and his voice was strange
to him dearest-you know me

  elizabeths face showed nothing but alarm and
perplexity she drew herself away from him the
chaperone a little grey-headed woman with mobile
features leant forward to intervene her resolute
bright eyes examined denton what do you say
she asked

  this young lady said denton-she knows me
  do you know him dear

  no said elizabeth in a strange voice and with
a hand to her forehead speaking almost as one who
repeats a lesson no i do not know him i know
-i do not know him

  but-but    not know me it is i-denton
denton to whom you used to talk dont you re-
member the flying stages the little seat in the open
air the verses-

  no cried elizabeth-no i do not know him
i do not know him there is something    but i
dont know all i know is that i do not know him
her face was a face of infinite distress

  the sharp eyes of the chaperone flitted to and
fro from the girl to the man you see she said
with the faint shadow of a smile she does not
know you

  i do not know you said elizabeth of that i
am sure

  but dear-the songs-the little verses-

  she does not know you said the chaperone
you must not    you have made a mistake
you must not go on talking to us after that you
must not annoy us on the public ways

  but- said denton and for a moment his miser-
ably haggard face appealed against fate

  you must not persist young man protested
the chaperone

  elizabeth he cried

  her face was the face of one who is tormented
i do not know you she cried hand to brow oh
i do not know you

  for an instant denton sat stunned then be stood
up and groaned aloud

  he made a strange gesture of appeal towards the
remote glass roof of the public way then turned and
went plunging recklessly from one moving platform
to another and vanished amidst the swarms of peo-
ple going to and fro thereon the chapcrones eyes
followed him and then she looked at the curious
faces about her

  dear asked elizabeth clasping her hand and
too deeply moved to heed observation who was that
man  who was that man 

  the chaperone raised her eyebrows she spoke
in a clear audible voice some half-witted creature
i have never set eyes on him before

  never

  never dear do not trouble your mind about a
thing like this


amazing stories

ynd soon after this the celebrated hypnotist who
dressed in green and yellow had another client
l he young man paced his consulting-room pale and
disordered i want to forget he cried i must
forget

  the hypnotist watched him with quiet eyes studied
his face and clothes and bearing to forget any-
thing-pleasure or pain-is to be by so much-less
however you know your own concern my fee is
high

  if only i can forget-

  thats easy enough with you you wish it ive
done much harder things quite recently  hardly
expected to do it the thing was done against the will
of the hypnotised person a love affair too-like
yours a girl so rest assured

  the young man came and sat beside the hypnotist
his manner was a forced calm me looked into the
hypnotists eyes i will tell you of course you
will want to know what it is there was a girl
her name was elizabeth mwres well   

  he stopped he had seen the instant surprise on
the hypnotists face in that instant he knew he
stood up he seemed to dominate the seated figure
by his side he gripped the shoulder of green and
gold for a time he could not find words

  give her vie back he said at last give her
me back

  what do you mean gasped the hypnotist

  give her me back

  give whom

  elizabeth mwres-the girl-

  the hypnotist tried to free himself he rose to his
feet dentons grip tightened

  let go cried the hypnotist thrusting an arm
against dentons chest

  in a moment the two men were locked in a clumsy
wrestle neither had the slightest training-for
athleticism except for exhibition and to afford op-
portunity for betting had faded out of the earth-
but denton was not only the younger but the stronger
of the two they swayed across the room and then
the hypnotist had gone down under his antagonist
they fell together   

  denton leaped to his feet dismayed at his own
fury but the hypnotist lay still and suddenly from
a little white mark where his forehead had struck
a stool shot a hurrying band of red for a space
denton stood over him irresolute trembling

  a fear of the consequences entered his gently nur-
tured mind he turned towards the door no
he said aloud and came back to the middle of the
room overcoming the instinctive repugnance of
one who had seen no act of violence in all his life
before he knelt down beside his antagonist and felt
his heart then he peered at the wound he rose
quietly and looked about him he began to see
more of the situation

  when presently the hypnotist recovered his senses
his head ached severely his back was against den-
tons knees and denton was sponging his face

  the hypnotist did not speak but presently he in-
dicated by a gesture that in his opinion he had been
sponged enough let me get up he said

  not yet said denton

  you have assaulted me you scoundrel

  we are alone said denton and the door is
secure

 there was an interval of thought

 unless i sponge said denton your forehead
 will develop a tremendous bruise

 you can go on sponging said the hypnotist
 sulkily

 there was another pause

  e might be in the stone age said the hyp-
 notist violence struggle

 in the stone age no man dared to come between
 man and woman said denton

 the hypnotist thought again

 what are you going to do he asked

 while you were insensible i found the girls ad-
 dress on your tablets i did not know it before i
 telephoned she will be here soon then-

 she will bring her chaperone

 that is all right

 but what- i dont see what do you mean
 to do

 i looked about for a weapon also it is an as-
 tonishing thing how few weapons there are nowa-
 days if you consider that in the stone age men
 owned scarcely anything but weapons i hit at last
 upon this lamp i have wrenched off the wires and
 tilings and i hold it so he extended it over the
 hypnotists shoulders with that i can quite easily
 smash your skull i mil-unless you do as i tell
 you

 violence is no remedy said the hypnotist quot-
 ing from the modern mans book of moral
 maxims

 its an undesirable disease said denton

 well

 you will tell that chaperone you are going to
 order the girl to marry that knobby little brute with
 the red hair and ferrety eyes i believe thats how
 things stand 

 yes-thats how things stand

 and pretending to do that you will restore her
 memory of me

 its unprofessional

 look here if  cannot have that girl i would
 rather die than not i dont propose to respect your
 little fancies if anything goes wrong you shall not
 live five minutes this is a rude makeshift of a
 weapon and it may quite conceivably be painful to
 kill you but i will it is unusual i know nowa-
 days to do things like this-mainly because there is
 so little in life that is worth being violent about
 the chaperone will see you directly she comes-
 i shall stand in that recess behind you

 the hypnotist thought you are a determined
 young man he said and only half civilized i
 have tried to do my duty to my client but in this
 affair you seem likely to get your own way   
 you mean to deal straightly

chapter ii
the vacant country

the world they say changed more between
the year  and the year  than it had
done in the previous five hundred years that
century the nineteenth century was the dawn of a
new epoch in the history of mankind-the epoch of
the great cities the end of the old order of country
life

  in the beginning of the nineteenth century the
majority of mankind still lived upon the countryside
as their way of life had been for countless genera-
tions all over the world they dwelt in little towns
and villages then and engaged either directly in
agriculture or in occupations that were of service to
the agriculturist they travelled rarely and dwelt
close to their work because swift means of transit
had not yet come the few who travelled went
either on foot or in slow sailing-ships or by means
of jogging horses incapable of more than sixty miles
a day think of it-sixty miles a day here and
thre in those sluggish times a town grew a little
larger than its neighbors as a port or as a centre of
government but all the towns in the world with
more than a hundred thousand inhabitants could be
counted on a mans fingers so it was in the begin-
ning of the nineteenth century by the end the in-
vention of railways telegraphs steamships and com-
plex agricultural machinery had changed all these
things changed them beyond all hope of return
the vast shops the varied pleasures the countless
conveniences of the larger towns were suddenly
possible and no sooner existed than they were
brought into competition with the homely resources
of the rural centres mankind were drawn to the
cities by an overwhelming attraction the demand
for labour fell with the increase of machinery the
local markets were entirely superseded and there
was a rapid growth of the larger centres at the ex-
pense of the open country

  the flow of population townward was the con-
stant preoccupation of victorian writers in great
britain and new england in india and china the
same thing was remarked everywhere a few swol-
len towns were visibly replacing the ancient order
that this was an inevitable result of improved means
of travel and transport-that given swift means of
transit these things must be-was realized by few
and the most puerile schemes were devised to over-
come the mysterious magnetism of the urban centres
and keep the people on the land

  yet the develqpments of the nineteenth century
were only the dawning of the new order the first
great cities of the new time were horribly incon-
venient darkened by smoky fogs insanitary and
noisy but the discovery of new methods of building
new methods of heating changed all this between
 and  the march of change was still more
rapid and between  and  the continually
accelerated progress of human invention made the
reign of victoria the good seem at last an almost
incredible vision of idyllic tranquil days

  the introduction of railways was only the first
step in that development of those means of locomo-
tion which finally revolutionized human life by the
year  railways and roads had vanished together
the railways robbed of theirrails had become
weedy ridges and ditches upon the face of the world

the old roads strange barbaric tracks of flint and
soil hammered by hand or rolled by rough iron roll-
ers strewn with miscellaneous filth and cut by iron
hoofs and wheels into ruts and puddles often many
inches deep had been replaced by patent tracks made
of a substance called eadhamite this eadhamite-
it was named after its patentee-ranks with the in-
vention of printing and steam as one of the epoch-
making discoveries of the worlds history

  when eadham discovered the substa xe he prob-
ably thought of it as a mere cheap substitute for
india rubber it cost a few shillings a ton but you
can never tell all an invention will do it was the
genius of a man named warming that pointed to the
possibility of using it not only for the tires of
wheels but as a road substance it was he who
organized the enormous network of public ways that
speedily covered the world

  these public ways were made with longitudinal
divisions on the outer on either side went foot
cyclists and conveyances traveling at a less speed
than twenty-five miles an hour in the middle mo-
tors capable of speed up to a hundred and the inner
warming in the face of enormous ridicule re-
served for vehicles travelling at speeds of a hundred
miles an hour and upward

  for ten years his inner ways were vacant be-
fore he died they were the most crowded of all and
vast light frameworks with wheels of twenty and
thirty feet in diameter hurled along them at paces
that year after year rose steadily towards two hun-
dred miles an hour and by the time this revolution
was accomplished a parallel revolution had trans-
formed the ever-growing cities before the devel-
opment of practical science the fogs and filth of
victorian times vanished electric heating replaced
fires in  the lighting of a fire that did not ab-
solutely consume its own smoke was made an in-
dictable nuisance and all the city ways all public
squares and places were covered in with a recently
invented glass-like substance the rooting of lon-
don became practically continuous certain short-
sighted and foolish legislation against tall buildings
was abolished and london from a squat expanse
of petty houses-feebly archaic in design-rose
steadily towards the sky to the municipal respon-
sibility for water light and drainage was added
another and that was ventilation

but to tell of all the changes in human con-
venience that these two hundred years brought
about to tell of the long foreseen invention of flying
to describe how life in households was steadily sup-
planted by life in interminable hotels how at last
even those who were still concerned in agricultural
work came to live in the towns and to go to and fro
to their work every day to describe how at last in
all england only four towns remained each with
many millions of people and how there were left
no inhabited houses in all the countryside to tell all
this would take us far from our story of denton
and his elizabeth they had been separated and re-
united and still they could not marry for denton
-it was his only fault-had no money neither had
elizabeth until she was twenty-one and as yet she
was only eighteen at twenty-one all the property
of her mother would come to her for that was the
custom of the time she did not know that it was
possible to anticipate her fortune and denton was
far too delicate a lover to suggest such a thing so


amazing stories

things stuck hopelessly between them elizabeth
said that she was very unhappy and that nobody un-
derstood her but denton and that when she was
away from him she was wretched and denton said
that his heart longed for her day and night and
they met as often as they could to enjoy the discus-
sion of their sorrows

  they met one day at their little seat upon the
flying stage the precise site of this meeting was
where in victorian times the road from wimbledon
came out upon the common they were however
five hundred feet above that point their seat looked
far over london to convey the appearance of it
all to a nineteenth-century reader would have been
difficult one would have had to tell him to think
of the crystal palace of the newly built mammoth
hotels-as those little affairs were called-of the
larger railway stations of his time and to imagine
such buildings enlarged to vast proportions and run
together and continuous over the whole metropolitan
area if then he was told that this continuous roof-
space bore a huge forest of rotating wind-wheels he
would have begun very dimly to appreciate what to
these young people was the commonest sight in their
lives

   to their eyes it had something of the quality of a
prison and they were talking as they had talked a
hundred times before of how they might escape
from it and be at last happy together escape from it
that is before the appointed three years were at an
end it was they both agreed not only impossible
but almost wicked to wait three years before that
said denton-and the notes of his voice told of a
splendid chest-we might both be dead

   their vigorous young hands had to grip at this
and then elizabeth had a still more poignant thought
that brought the tears from her wholesome eyes and
down her healthy cheeks one of us she said
one of us might be-

   she choked she could not say the word that is so
terrible to the young and happy

   yet to marry and be very poor in the cities of that
time was-for any one who had lived pleasantly-a
very dreadful thing in the old agricultural days
that had drawn to an end in the eighteenth century
there had been a pretty proverb of love in a cottage
and indeed in those days the poor of the countryside
had dwelt in flower-covered diamond-windowed cot-
tages of thatch and plaster with the sweet air and
earth about them amidst tangled hedges and the song
of birds and with the ever-changing sky overhead
but all this had changed the change was already be-
ginning in the nineteenth century and a new sort
of life was opening for the poor-in the lower quar-
ters of the city

   in the nineteenth century the lower quarters were
still beneath the sky they were areas of land on
clay or other unsuitable soil liable to floods or ex-
posed to the smoke of more fortunate districts in-
sufficiently supplied with water and as insanitary
as the great fear of infectious diseases felt by the
wealthier classes permitted in the twenty-second
century however the growth of the city story above
story and the coalescence of buildings had led to a
different arrangement the prosperous people lived
in a vast series of sumptuous hotels in the upper
storeys and halls of the city fabric the industrial
population dwelt beneath in the tremendous ground-
floor and basement so to speak of the place

in the refinement of life and manners these lower
classes differed little from their ancestors the
east-enders of queen victorias time but they had
developed a distinct dialect of their own in these
under ways they lived and died rarely ascending to
the surface except when work took them there
since for most of them this was the sort of life to
which they had been born they found no great
misery in such circumstances but for people like
denton and elizabeth such a plunge would have
seemed more terrible than death

and yet what else is there asked elizabeth
denton professed not to know apart from his
own feeling of delicacy he was not sure how eliza-
beth would like the idea of borrowing on the strength
of her expectations

  the passage from london to pans even said
elizabeth was beyond their means and in paris as
in any other city in the world life would be just as
costly and impossible as in london

  well might denton cry aloud if only we had
lived in those days dearest if only we had lived
in the past for to their eyes even nineteenth-cen-
tury whitechapel was seen through a mist of
romance

  is there nothing cried elizabeth suddenly
weeping must we really wait for those three long
years fancy three years-six-and-thirty months
the human capacity for patience had not grown with
the ages

  then suddenly denton was moved to speak of
something that had already flickered across his mind
he had hit upon it at last it seemed to him so wild
a suggestion that he made it only half seriously but
to put a thing into words has ever a way of making
it seem more real and possible than it seemed before
and so it was with him

  suppose he said we went into the country
she looked at him to see if he was serious in
proposing such an adventure

  the country

  yes-beyond there beyond the hills

  how could we live she said where could
we live

  it is not impossible he said people used to
live in the country

  but then there were houses

  there are the ruins of villages and towns now
on the clay lands they are gone of course but
they are still left on the grazing land because it does
not pay the food company to remove them i
know that-for certain besides one sees them
from the flying machines you know well we
might shelter in some one of these and repair it with
our hands do you know the thing is not so wild
as it seems some of the men who go out every
day to look after the crops and herds might be paid
to bring us food   

  she stood in front of him how strange it would
be if one really could   

  why not

  but no one dares

  that is no reason

  it would be-oh it would be so romantic and
strange if only it were possible

  why not possible

  there are so many things think of all the
things we have things that we should miss
should we miss them after all the life we lead
is very unreal-very artificial he began to ex-
a story of the days to come



panel his idea aiiti as he warmed to his exposition
the fantastic quality of his first proposal faded away

  she thought but i have heard of prowlers-
cscaped criminals

  lie nodded he hesitated over his answer be-
cause he thought it sounded boyish he blushed
i could get some one i know to make me a sword

  she looked at him with enthusiasm growing in her
eyes she had heard of swords had seen one in a
museum she thought of those ancient days when
men wore them as a common thing his suggestion
seemed an impossible dream to her and perhaps for
that reason she was eager for more detail and in-
venting for the most part as he went along he told
her how they might live in the country as the old-
world people had done with every detail her in-
terest grew for she was one of those girls tor whom
romance and adventure have a fascination

  his suggestion seemed i say an impossible dream
to her on that day but the next day they talked about
it again and it was strangely less impossible

  at first we should take food said denton we
could carry food for ten or twelve days it was an
age of compact artificial nourishment and such a
provision had none of the unwieldy suggestion it
would have had in the nineteenth century

  but-until our house she asked-until it was
ready where should we sleep 

  it is summer

  but    what do you mean

  there was a time when there were no houses in
the world when all mankind slept always in the
open air

  but for us the emptiness no walls-no
ceiling

  dear he said in london you have many beau-
tiful ceilings artists paint them and stud them
with lights but i have seen a ceiling more beauti-
ful than any in london   

  but where

  it is the ceiling under which we two would be
alone   

  you mean   

dear he said it is something the world has
forgotten it is heaven and all the laost of stars

each time they talked the thing seemed more
possible and more desirable to them in a week
or so it was quite possible another week and it
was the inevitable thing they had to do a great en-
thusiasm for the country seized hold of them and
possessed them the sordid tumult of the town
they said overwhelmed them they marvelled that
this simple way out of their troubles had never come
upon them before

  one morning near midsummer-day there was a
new minor official upon the flying stage and den-
tons place was to know him no more

  our two young people had secretly married and
were going forth manfully out of the city in which
they and their ancestors before them had lived all
their days she wore a new dress of white cut in an
old-fashioned pattern and he had a bundle of pro-
visions strapped athwart his back and in his hand he
carried-rather shame-facedlv it is true and under
his purple cloak-an implement of archaic form a
cross-hilted thing of tempered steel

  imagine that going forth in their days the
sprawling suburbs of victorian times with their vile
roads petty houses foolish little gardens of shrub

and geranium and all their futile pretentious priva-
cies had disappeared the towering buildings of the
new age the mechanical ways the electric and water
mains all came to an end together like a wall like
a cliff near four hundred feet in height abrupt and
sheer all about the city spread the carrot swede
and turnip fields of the food company vegetables
that were the basis of a thousand varied foods and
weeds and hedgerow tangles had been utterly ex-
tirpated the incessant expense of weeding that
went on year after year in the petty wasteful and
barbaric farming of the ancient days the food com-
pany had economised for ever more by a campaign
of extermination here and there however neat
rows of bramble standards and apple trees with
whitewashed stems intersected the fields and at
places groups of gigantic teazles reared their fav-
oured spikes  lere and there huge agricultural ma-
chines hunched under waterproof covers the
mingled waters of the wey and mole and wandle
ran in rectangular channels and wherever a gentle
elevation of the ground permitted a fountain of de-
odorised sewage distributed its benefits athwart the
land and made a rainbow  the sunlight

  by a great archway in that enormous city wall
emerged the eadhamite road to portsmouth swarm-
ing in the morning sunshine with an enormous traffic
bearing the blue-clad servants of the food company
to their toil a rushing traffic beside which they
seemed two scarce-moving dots along the outer
tracks hummed and rattled the tardy little old-fash-
ioned motors of such as had duties within twenty
miles or so of the city the inner ways were filled
with vaster mechanisms-swift monocycles bearing a
score of men lank multicycles quadricycles sagging
with heavy loads empty gigantic produce carts that
would come back again filled before the sun was
setting all with throbbing engines and noiseless
wheels and a perpetual wild melody of horns and
gongs

  along the very verge of the outermost way our
young people went in silence newly wed and oddly
shy of one anothers company many were the
things shouted to thenras they tramped along for in
 a foot-passenger on an english road was al-
most as strange a sight as a motor car would have
been in  but they went on with steadfast eyes
into the country paying no heed to such cries

  before them in the south rose the downs blue at
first and as they came nearer changing to green
surmounted by the row of gigantic wind-wheels that
supplemented the wind-wheels upon the roof-spaces
of the city and broken and restless with the long
morning shadows of those whirling vanes by mid-
day they had come so near that they could see here
and there little patches of pallid dots-the sheep the
meat department of the food company owned in
another hour they had passed the clay and the root
crops and the single fence that hedged them in and
the prohibition against trespass no longer held the
levelled roadway plunged into a cutting with all its
traffic and they could leave it and walk over the
greensward and up the open hillside

  never had these children of the latter days been
together in such a lonely place

  they were both very hungry and footsore-for
walking was a rare exercise-and presently they sat
down on the weedless close-cropped grass and
looked back for the first time at the city from which
they had come shining wide and splendid in the blue


amazing stories

haze of the valley of the thames elizabeth was a
little afraid of the unenclosed sheep away up the
slope-she had never been near big unrestrained
animals before-but denton reassured her and
overhead a white-winged bird circled in the blue

  they talked but little until they had eaten and
then their tongues were loosened he spoke of the
happiness that was now certainly theirs of the folly
of not breaking sooner out of the magnificent prison
of latter-day life of the old romantic days that had
passed from the world for ever and then he be-
came boastful he took up the sword that lay on
the ground beside him and she took it from his hand
and ran a tremulous finger along the blade

  and you could she said you-could raise this
and strike a man 

  why not if there were need

  but she said it seems so horrible it woulc
slash    there would be-her voice sank-
blood 

  in the old romances you have read often enough

  oh i know in those -yes but that is different
one knows it is not blood but just a sort of red
ink    and you-killing

  sire looked at him doubtfully and then handed
him back the sword

after they had rested and eaten they rose up
and went on their way towards the hills they
passed quite close to a huge flock of sheep who stared
and bleated at their unaccustomed figures she had
never seen sheep before and she shivered to think
such gentle things must needs he slain for food a
sheep-dog barked from a distance and then a shep-
herd appeared amidst the supports of the wind-
wheels and came down towards them

  when he drew near he called out asking whither
they were going

  denton hesitated and told him briefly that theji
sought some ruined house among the downs in
which they might live together he tried to speak
in an off-hand manner as though it was a usual thing
to do the man stared incredulously

  have you done anything he asked

  nothing said denton only we dont want
to live in a city any longer why should we live in
cities 

  the shepherd stared more incredulously than
ever you cant live here he said

  we mean to try

  the shepherd stared from one to the other
youll go back to-morrow he said it looks
pleasant enough in the sunlight    are you sure
youve done nothing we shepherds are not such
great friends of the police

  denton looked at him steadfastly no he said
but we are too poor to live in the city and we
cant bear the thought of wearing clothes of blue
canvas and doing drudgery we are going to live
a simple life here like the people of old

  the shepherd was a bearded man with a thought-
ful face he glanced at elizabeths fragile beauty

  they had simple minds he said

  so have we said denton

  the shepherd smiled

  if you go along here he said along the crest
beneath the wind-wheels you will see a heap of
mounds and ruins on your right-hand side that

was once a town called epsom there are no houses
there and the bricks have been used for a sheep
pen go on and another heap on the edge of the
root-land is leatherhead and then the hill turns
away along the border of a valley and there are
woods of beech keep along the crest you will
come to quite wild places in some parts in spite
of all the weeding that is done ferns and bluebells
and other such useless plants are growing still and
through it all underneath the wind-wheels runs a
straight lane paved with stones a roadway of the
romans two thousand years old go to the right of
that down into the valley and follow it along by the
banks of the river you come presently to a street
of houses many with the roofs still sound upon
them there you may find shelter

  they thanked him

  but its a quiet place there is no light after
dark there and i have heard tell of robbers it is
lonely nothing happens there the phonographs
of the story-tellers the kinematograph entertain-
ments the news machines-none of them are to be
found there if you are hungry there is no food
if you are ill  doctor   he stopped

  we shall try it said denton moving to go on
then a thought struck him and he made an agree-
ment with the shepherd and learnt where they might
find him to buy and bring them anything of which
they stood in need out of the city

and in the evening they came to the deserted
village with its houses that seemed so small
and odd to them they found it golden in the glory
of the sunset and desolate and still they went from
one deserted house to another marvelling at their
quaint simplicity and debating which they should
choose and at last in a sunlit corner of a room
that had lost its outer wall they came upon a wild
flower a little flower of blue that the weeders of the
food company had overlooked

  that house they decided upon but they did not
remain in it long that night because they were
resolved to feast upon nature and moreover the
louses became very gaunt and shadowy after the
sunlight had faded out of the sky so after they
had rested a little time they went to the crest of the
hill again to see with their own eyes the silence of
heaven set with stars about which the old poets had
had so many things to tell it was a wonderful sight
and denton talked like the stars and when they
went down the hill at last the sky was pale with
dawn they slept but little and in the morning
when they woke a thrush was singing in a tree

  so these young people of the twenty-second cen-
tury began their exile that morning they were
very busy exploring the resources of this new home
in which they were going to live the simple life
they did not explore very fast or very far because
they went everywhere hand-in-hand but they found
the beginnings of some furniture beyond the vil-
lage was a store of winter fodder for the sheep of
the food company and denton dragged great arm-
fuls to the house to make a bed and in several of
the houses were old fungus-eaten chairs and tables
-rough barbaric clumsy furniture it seemed to
them and made of wood they repeated many of
the things they had said on the previous day and
towards evening they found another flower a hare-
bell in the late afternoon some company shep-
a story of the days to come



herds went down the river valley riding on a big
multicycle but they hid from them because their
-presence elizabeth said seemed to spoil the romance
of this old-world place altogether

  in this fashion they lived a week for all that
week the days were cloudless and the nights nights
of starry glory that were invaded each a little more
by a crescent moon

   yet something of the first splendour of their com-
ing faded-faded imperceptibly day after day den-
tons eloquence became fitful and lacked fresh topics
of inspiration the fatigue of their long march from
london told in a certain stiffness of the limbs and
each suffered from a slight unaccountable cold
moreover denton became aware of unoccupied time
in one place among the carelessly heaped lumber of
the old times he found a rust-eaten spade and with
this he made a fitful attack on the razed and grass-
grown garden-though he had nothing to plant or
sow he returned to elizabeth with a sweat-stream-
ing face after half an hour of such work

  there were giants in those days he said not
understanding what wont and training will do and
their walk that day led them along the hills until
they could see the city shimmering far away in the
valley i wonder how things are going on there
he said

  and then came a change in the weather come
out and see the clouds she cried and behold they
were a sombre purple in the north and east stream-
ing up to ragged edges at the zenith and as they
went up the hill these hurrying streamers blotted
out the sunset suddenly the wind set the beech-
trees swaying and whispering and elizabeth shiv-
ered and then far away the lightning flashed
flashed like a sword that is drawn suddenly and the
distant thunder marched about the sky and even
as they stood astonished pattering upon them came
the first headlong raindrops of the storm in an
instant the last streak of sunset was hidden by a
falling curtain of hail and the lightning flashed
again and the voice of the thunder roared louder
and all about them the world scowled dark and
strange

   seizing hands these children of the city ran down
the hill to their home in infinite astonishment and
ere they reached it elizabeth was weeping with
dismay and the darkling ground about them was
white and brittle and active with the pelting hail

   then began a strange and terrible night for them
for the first time in their civilised lives they were
in absolute darkness they were wet and cold and
shivering all about them hissed the hail and through
the long neglected ceilings of the derelict home came
noisy spouts of water and formed pools and rivulets
on the creaking floors as the gusts of the storm
struck the worn-out building it groaned and shud-
dered and now a mass of plaster from the wall
would slide and smash and now some loosened tile
would rattle down the roof and crash into the empty
greenhouse below elizabeth shuddered and was
still denton wrapped his gay and flimsy city cloak
about her and so they crouched in the darkness
and ever the thunder broke louder and nearer and
ever more lurid flashed the lightning jerking into
a momentary gaunt clearness the steaming dripping
room in which they sheltered

  never before had they been in the open air save
when the sun was shining all their time had been

spent in the warm and airy ways and halls and rooms
of the latter-day city it was to them that night
as if they were in some other world some disordered
chaos of stress and tumult and almost beyond hop-
ing that they should ever see the city ways again

  the storm seemed to last interminably until at
last they dozed between the thunderclaps and then
very swiftly it fell and ceased and as the last
patter of the rain died away they heard an un-
familiar sound

ffttttiat is that cried elizabeth

  vv it came again it was the barking of
dogs it drove down the desert lane and passed
and through the window whitening the wall before
them and throwing upon it the shadow of the win-
dow-frame and of a tree in black silhouette shone
the light of the waxing moon   

  just as the pale dawn was drawing the things
about them into sight the fitful barking of dogs
came near again and stopped they listened after
a pause they heard the quick pattering of feet seek-
ing round the house and short half-smothered barks
then again everything was still

  ssh whispered elizabeth and pointed to the
door of their room

  denton went half-way towards the door and
stood listening he came back with a face of af-
fected unconcern they must be the sheep-dogs
of the food company he said they will do us
no harm

  he sat down again beside her what a night
it has been he said to hide how keenly he was
listening

  i dont like dogs answered elizabeth after a
long silence

  dogs never hurt any one said denton in
the old days-in the nineteenth century-everybody
had a dog

  there was a romance i heard once a dog
killed a man

  not this sort of dog said denton confidently
some of those romances-are exaggerated

   suddenly a half bark and a pattering up the stair-
case the sound of panting denton sprang to his
feet and drew the sword out of the damp straw upon
which they had been lying then in the doorway
appeared a gaunt sheep-dog and halted there be-
hind it stared another for an instant man and
brute faced each other hesitating

  then denton being ignorant of dogs made a
sharp step forward go away he said with a
clumsy motion of his sword

  the dog started and growled denton stopped
sharply good dog he said

  the growling jerked into a bark

  good dog said denton the second dog
growled and barked a third out of sight down the
staircase took up the barking also outside others
gave tongue-a large number it seemed to denton

  this is annoying said denton without taking
his eye off the brutes before him of course the
shepherds wont come out of the city for hours yet
naturally these dogs dont quite make us out

  i cant hear shouted elizabeth she stood up
and came to him

  denton tried again but the barking still drowned
his voice the sound had a curious effect upon his
blood odd disused emotions began to stir his face


amazing stories

changed as lie shouted he tried again the bark-
ing seemed to mock him and one dog danced a pace
forward bristling suddenly he turned and utter-
ing certain words in the dialect of the underways
words incomprehensible to elizabeth he made for
the dogs there was a sudden cessation of the bark-
ing a growl and a snapping elizabeth saw the
snarling head of the foremost dog its white teeth
and retracted ears and the flash of the thrust blade
the brute leapt into the air and was flung back

  then denton with a shout was driving the dogs
before him the sword flashed above his head with
a sudden new freedom of gesture and then he van-
ished down the staircase she made six steps to
follow him and on the landing there was blood
she stopped and hearing the tumult of dogs and
dentons shouts pass out of the house ran to the
window

  nine wolfish sheep-dogs were scattering one
writhed before the porch and denton tasting that
strange delight of combat that slumbers still in the
blood of even the most civilized man was shouting
and running across the garden space and then she
saw something that for a moment he did not see
the dogs circled round this way and that and came
again they had him in the open

   in an instant she divined the situation she would
have called to him for a moment she felt sick and
helpless and then obeying a strange impulse she
gathered up her white skirt and ran downstairs in
the hall was the rusting spade that was it she
seized it and ran out

  she came none too soon one dog rolled before
him well-nigh slashed in hal f but a second had him
by the thigh a third gripped his collar behind and
a fourth had the blade of the sword between its
teeth tasting its own blood he parried the leap of
a fifth with his left arm

   it might have been the first century instead of the
twenty-second so far as she was concerned all
the gentleness of her eighteen years of city life van-
ished before the primordial need the spade smote
hard and sure and cleft a dogs skull another
crouching for a spring yelped with dismay at this
unexpected antagonist and rushed aside two
wasted precious moments on the binding of a femi-
nine skirt

  the collar of dentons cloak tore and parted as
he staggered back and that dog too felt the spade
and ceased to trouble him he sheathed his sword
in the brute at his thigh

  to the wall cried elizabeth and in three sec-
onds the fight was at an end and our young people
stood side by side while a remnant of five dogs
with ears and tails of disaster fled shamefully from
the stricken field

  for a moment they stood panting and victorious
and then elizabeth dropping her spade covered her
face and sank to the ground in a paroxysm of weep-
ing denton looked about him thrust the point of
his sword into the ground so that it was at hand
and stooped to comfort her

at last their more tumultuous emotions subsided
and they could talk again she leant upon the
wall and he sat upon it so that he could keep an eye
open for any returning dogs two at any rate were
up on the hillside and keeping up a vexatious barking

  she was tear-stained but not very wretched now
because for half an hour he had been repeating that

 she was brave and had saved his life but a new
 fear was growing in her mind

  they are the dogs of the food company she
 said there will be trouble

  i am afraid so very likely they will prosecute
 us for trespass

  a pause

  in the old times he said this sort of thing
 happened day after day

  last night she said i could not live through
 another such night

  he looked at her her face was pale for want of
 sleep and drawn and haggard he came to a sudden
 resolution we must go back he said

  she looked at the dead dogs and shivered we
 cannot stay here she said

  we must go back he repeated glancing over
 his shoulder to see if the enemy kept their distance
 we have been happy for a time    ryt the world
 is too civilized ours is the age of cities more
 of this will kill us

  but what are we to do how can we live there
 denton hesitated his heel kicked against the wall
 on which he sat its a thing i havent mentioned
 before he said and coughed but   

  yes

  you could raise money on your expectations
 he said

  could i  she said eagerly

  of course you could what a child you are

  she stood up and her face was bright why did
 you not tell me before she asked and all this
 time we have been here

  he looked at her for a moment and smiled then
 the smile vanished i thought it ought to come
 from you he said i didnt like to ask for your
 money and besides-at first i thought this would
 be rather fine

  there was a pause

  it has been fine he said and glanced once more
 over his shoulder until all this began

  yes she said those first days the first three
 days

  they looked for a space into one anothers faces
 and then denton slid down from the wall and took
 her hand

  to each generation he said the life of its
 time i see it all plainly now in the city-that is
 the life to which we were born to live in any other
 fashion    coming here was a dream and this-is
 the awakening

  it was a pleasant dream she said-in the
 beginning

  for a long space neither spoke

  if we would reach the city before the shepherds
 come here we must start said denton we must
 get our food out of the house and eat as we go
 denton glanced about him again and giving the
 dead dogs a wide berth they walked across the gar-
 den space and into the house together they found 
 the wallet with their food and descended the blood-
 stained stairs again in the hall elizabeth stopped
 one minute she said there is something here
 she led the way into the room in which that one
 little blue flower was blooming she stooped to it
 she touched it with her hand

  i want it she said and then i cannot take
 it

  impulsively she stooped and kissed its petals

  then silently side by side they went across the
a story of the days to come



 empty garden-space into the old high road and set
 their faces resolutely towards the distant city-
 towards the complex mechanical city of those latter
 days the city that had swallowed up mankind

chapter iii
the ways of the city

prominent if not paramount among world-
changing inventions in the history of man is
that series of contrivances in locomotion that
began with the railway and ended for a century or
more with the motor and the patent road that
these contrivances together with the device of lim-
ited liability joint stock companies and the super-
session of agricultural laborers by skilled men with
ingenious machinery would necessarily concentrate
mankind in cities of unparalleled magnitude and
work an entire revolution in human life became
after the event a thing so obvious that it is a matter
of astonishment it was not more clearly anticipated
yet that any steps should be taken to anticipate the
miseries such a revolution might entail does not ap-
pear even to have been suggested and the idea that
the moral prohibitions and sanctions the privileges
and concessions the conception of property and re-
sponsibility of comfort and beauty that had ren-
dered the mainly agricultural states of the past pros-
perous and happy would fail in the rising torrent
of novel opportunities and novel stimulations never
seems to have entered the nineteenth-century mind
that a citizen kindly and fair in his ordinary life
could as a shareholder become almost murderously
greedy that commercial methods that were reason-
able and honorable on the old-fashioned countryside
should on an enlarged scale be deadly and over-
whelming  that ancient charity was modern pauperi-
zation and ancient employment modern sweating
that in fact a revision and enlargement of the duties
and rights of man had become urgently necessary
were things it could not entertain nourished as it
was on an archaic system of education and pro-
foundly restrospective and legal in all its habits of
thought it was known that the accumulation of
men in cities involved unprecedented dangers of
pestilence there was an energetic development of
sanitation but that the diseases of gambling and
usury of luxury and tyranny should become en-
demic and produce horrible consequences was be-
yond the scope of nineteenth-century thought and
so as if it were some inorganic process practically
unhindered by the creative will of man the growth
of the swarming unhappy cities that mark the twenty-
first century accomplished itself

  the new society was divided into three main
classes at the summit slumbered the property
owner enormously rich by accident rather than de-
sign potent save for the will and aim the last avatar
of hamlet in the world below was the enormous
multitude of workers employed by the gigantic com-
panies that monopolized control and between these
two the dwindling middle class officials of innumer-
able sorts foremen managers the medical legal
artistic and scholastic classes and the minor rich a
middle class whose members led a life of insecure
luxury and precarious speculation amidst the move-
ments of the great managers

already the love story and the marrying of two
persons of this middle class have been told how

they overcame the obstacles between them and how
they tried the simple old-fashioned way of living on
the countryside and came back speedily enough into
the city of london denton had no means so eliza-
beth borrowed money on the securities that her father
mwres held in trust for her until she was one-and-
twenty

  the rate of interest she paid was of course high
because of the uncertainty of her security and the
arithmetic of lovers is often sketchy and optimistic
yet they had very glorious times after that return
they determined they would not go to a pleasure
city nor waste their days rushing through the air
from one part of the world to the other for in spite
of one disillusionment their tastes were still old-
fashioned they furnished their little room with
quaint old victorian furniture and found a shop on
the forty-second floor in seventh way where printed
books of the old sort were still to be bought it was
their pet affectation to read print instead of hearing
phonographs and when presently there came a
sweet little girl to unite them further if it were pos-
sible elizabeth would not send it to a creche as the
custom was but insisted on nursing it at home the
rent of their apartments was raised on account of
this singular proceeding but that they did not mind
it only meant borrowing a little more

  presently elizabeth was of age and denton had
a business interview with her father that was not
agreeable an exceedingly disagreeable interview
with their money-lender followed from which he
brought home a white face on his return eliza-
beth had to tell him of a new and marvelous intona-
tion of goo that their daughter had devised but
denton was inattentive in the midst just as she
was at the cream of her description he interrupted
how much money do you think we have left now
that everything is settled

  she stared and stopped her appreciative swaying
of the goo genius that had accompanied her de-
scription

  you dont mean   

  yes he answered ever so much we have
been wild its the interest or something and
the shares you had slumped your father did not
mind said it was not his business after what had
happened hes going to marry again    well-
we have scarcely a thousand left

  only a thousand

  only a thousand

  and elizabeth sat down for a moment she re-
garded him with a white face then her eyes went
about the quaint old-fashioned room with its mid-
dle victorian furniture and genuine oleographs and
rested at last on the little lump of humanity within
her arms

denton glanced at her and stood downcast
then he swung round on his heel and walked
up and down very rapidly

  i must get something to do he broke out pres-
ently i am an idle scoundrel i ought to have
thought of this before i have been a selfish fool
i wanted to be with you all day 

  he stopped looking at her white face suddenly
he came and kissed her and the little face that nestled
against her breast

  its all right dear he said standing over her
you wont be lonely now-now dings is beginning
to talk to you and i can soon get something to do


amazing stories

you know soon    easily    its only a shock at
first but it will come all right its sure to come
right i will go out again as soon as i have rested
and find what can lie done for the present its hard
to think of anything  

  it would be hard to leave these rooms said
elizabeth but-

  there wont be any need of that-trust me
  they are expensive

  denton waved that aside he began talking of
the work he could do he was not very explicit
what it would be but he was quite sure that there
was something to keep them comfortably in the
happy middle class whose way of life was the only
one they knew

  there are three-and-thirty million people in lon-
don he said some of them must have need of me
some must

  the trouble is    well-bindon that brown
little old man your father wanted you to marry
hes an important person  i cant go back to my
flying-stage work because he is now a commissioner
of the flying stage clerks

   didnt know that said elizabeth

  he was made that in the last few weeks  or
things would be easy enough for they liked me on
the flying stage but theres dozens of other things
to be done-dozens dont you worry dear ill
rest a little while and then well dine and then ill
start on my rounds i know lots of people-lots
so they rested and then they went to the public
dining-room and dined and then he started on his
search for employment but they soon realized that
in the matter of one convenience the world was just
as badly off as it had ever been and that was a nice
secure honorable remunerative employment leaving
ample leisure for the private life and demanding
no special ability no violent exertion or risk and
no sacrifice of any sort for its attainment he
evolved a number of brilliant projects and spent
many days hurrying from one part of the enormous
city to another in search of influential friends and
all his influential friends were glad to see him and
very sanguine until it came to definite proposals
and then they became guarded and vague he would
part with them coldly and think over their behavior
and get irritated on his way back and stop at some
telephone office and spend money on an animated but
unprofitable quarrel and as the days passed he
got so worried and irritated that even to seem kind
and careless before elizabeth cost him an effort-as
she being a loving woman perceived very clearly

  after an extremely complex preface one day she
helped him out with a painful suggestion he had
expected her to weep and give way to despair when
it came to selling all their joyfully bought early vic-
torian treasures their quaint objects of art their
antimacassars bead mats repp curtains veneered
furniture gold-framed steel engravings and pencil
drawings wax flowers under shades stuffed birds
and all sorts of choice old things but it was she
who made the proposal the sacrifice seemed to fill
her with pleasure and so did the idea of shifting to
apartments ten or twelve floors lower in another
hotel so long as dings is with us nothing mat-
ters she said its all experience so he kissed
her said she was braver than when she fought the
sheep-dogs called her boadicea and abstained very
carefully from reminding her that they would have
to pay a considerably higher rent on account of the

little voice with which dings greeted the perpetual
uproar of the city

  his idea had been to get elizabeth out of the way
when it came to selling the absurd furniture about
which their affections were twined and tangled but
when it came to the sale it was elizabeth who hag-
gled with the dealer while denton went about the
running ways of the city white and sick with sor-
row and the fear of what was still to come when
they moved into their sparsely furnished pink-and-
white apartments in a cheap hotel there came an
outbreak of furious energy on his part and then
nearly a week of lethargy during which he sulked
at home through those days elizabeth shone like
a star and at the end dentons misery found a vent
in tears and then he went out into the city ways
again and-to his utter amazement-found some
work to do

  his standard of employment had fallen steadily
until at last it had reached the lowest level of inde-
pendent workers at first he had aspired to some
high official position in the great flying or windvane
or water companies or to an appointment on one
of the general intelligence organizations that had
replaced newspapers or to some professional part-
nership but those were the dreams of the beginning
from that he had passed to speculation and three
hundred gold lions out of elizabeths thousand
had vanished one evening in the share market now
he was glad his good looks secured him a trial in the
position of salesman to the suzannah hat syndicate
a syndicate dealing in ladies caps hair decorations
and hats-for though the city was completely cov-
ered in ladies still wore extremely elaborate and
beautiful hats at the theatres and places of public
worship

it would have been amusing if one could have
confronted a regent street shopkeeper of the
nineteenth century with the development of his estab-
lishment in which dentons duties lay nineteenth
way was still sometimes called regent street but
it was now a street of moving platforms and nearly
eight hundred feet wide the middle space was
immovable and gave access by staircases descend-
ing into subterranean ways to the houses on either
side right and left were an ascending series of
continuous platforms each of which traveled about
five miles an hour faster than the one internal to it
so that one could step from platform to platform
until one reached the swiftest outer way and so go
about the city the establishment of the suzannah
hat syndicate projected a vast facade upon the
outer way sending out overhead at either end an
overlapping series of huge white glass screens on
which gigantic animated pictures of the faces of well-
known beautiful living women wearing novelties in
hats were thrown a dense crowd was always col-
lected in the stationary central way watching a vast
kinematograph which displayed the changing fash-
ion the whole front of the building was in per- 
petual chromatic change and all down the facadc-
four hundred feet it measured-and all across the
street of moving ways laced and winked and glit-
tered in a thousand varieties of color and lettering
the inscription-

 susanna ets suzanna ets

  a broadside of gigantic phonographs drowned all
conversation in the moving way and roared hats
a story of the days to come



at the passer-by while far down the street and up
other batteries counseled the public to walk down
for suzannah and queried why dont you buy
the girl a hat 

  for the benefit of those who chanced to be deaf
-and deafness was not uncommon in the london
of that age inscriptions of all sizes were thrown
from the roof above upon the moving platforms
themselves and on ones hand or on the bald head
of the man lefore one or on a ladys shoulders or
in a sudden jet of flame before ones feet the mov-
ing finger wrote in unanticipated letters of fire ets
r chip tdc or simply cts and despite all these
efforts so high was the pitch at which the city lived
so trained became ones eyes and ears to ignore all
sorts of advertisement that many a citizen had
passed that place thousands of times and was still
unaware of the existence of the suzannah hat
syndicate

  to enter the building one descended the staircase
in the middle way and walked through a public
passage in which pretty girls promenaded girls who
were willing to wear a ticketed hat for a small fee
the entrance chamber was a large hall in which wax
heads fashionably adorned rotated gracefully upon
pedestals and from this one passed through a cash
office to an interminable series of little rooms each
with its salesman its three or four hats and pins
its mirrors its kinematographs telephones and hat
slides in communication with the central depot its
comfortable lounge and tempting refreshments a
salesman in such an apartment did denton now be-
come it was his business to attend to any of the
incessant stream of ladies who chose to stop with
him to behave as winningly as possible to offer re-
freshment to converse on any topic the possible cus-
tomer chose and to guide the conversation dexter-
ously but not insistently towards hats he was to
suggest trying on various types of hat and to show
by his manner and bearing but without any coarse
flattery the enhanced impression made by the hats
lie wished to sell he had several mirrors adapted
by various subtleties of curvature and tint to differ-
ent types of face and complexion and much de-
pended on the proper use of these

  denton flung himself at these curious and not
very congenial duties with a good will and energy
that would have amazed him a year before but all to
no purpose the senior manageress who had
selected him for appointment and conferred various
small marks of favor upon him suddenly changed
in her manner declared for  assignable cause that
he was stupid and dismissed him at the end of six
weeks of salesmanship so denton had to resume
his ineffectual search for employment

  this second search did not last very long their
money was at the ebb to eke it out a little longer
they resolved to part with their darling dings and
took that small person to one of the public crbches
that abounded in the city that was the common
use of the time the industrial emancipation of
women the correlated disorganization of the se-
cluded home had rendered crt-chcs a necessity for
all but very rich and exceptionally-minded people
therein children encountered hygienic and educa-
tional advantages impossible without such organiza-
tion creches were of all classes and types of luxury
down to those of the labor company where children
were taken on credit to be redeemed in labor as
they grew up

but both denton and elizabeth being as i have
explained strange old-fashioned young people
full of nineteenth-century ideas hated these con-
venient crcchcs exceedingly and at last took their
little daughter to one with extreme reluctance they
were received by a motherly person in a uniform who
was very brisk and prompt in her manner until
elizabeth wept at the mention of parting from her
child the motherly person after a brief astonish-
ment at this unusual emotion changed suddenly into
a creature of hope and comfort and so won eliza-
beths gratitude for life they were conducted into
a vast room presided over by several nurses and with
hundreds of two-year-old girls grouped about the
toy-covered floor this was the two-year-old room
two nurses came forward and elizabeth watched
their bearing towards dings with jealous eyes they
were kind-it was clear they felt kind and yet   

  presently it was time to go by that time dings
was happily established in a corner sitting on the
floor with her arms filled and herself indeed for
the most part hidden by an unaccustomed wealth of
toys she seemed careless of all human relation-
ships as her parents receded

  they were forbidden to upset her by saying
good-bye

  at the door elizabeth glanced back for the last
time and behold dings had dropped her new wealth
and was standing with a dubious face suddenly
elizabeth gasped and the motherly nurse pushed her
forward and closed the door

  you can come again soon dear she said with
unexpected tenderness in her eyes for a moment
elizabeth stared at her with a blank face you can
come again soon repeated the nurse then with
a swift transition elizabeth was weeping in the
nurses arms so it was that dentons heart was
won also

  and three weeks after our young people were
absolutely penniless and only one way lay open
they must go to the labor company so soon as
the rent was a week overdue their few remaining
possessions were seized and with scant courtesy
they were shown the way out of the hotel eliza-
beth walked along the passage towards the staircase
that ascended to the motionless middle way too
dulled by misery to think denton stopped behind
to finish a stinging and unsatisfactory argument with
the hotel porter and then came hurrying after her
flushed and hot tte slackened his pace as lie over-
took her and together they ascended to the middle
way in silence there they found two seats vacant
and sat down

  we need not go there-yet said elizabeth

  no-not till we are hungry said denton

  they said no more

  elizabeths eyes sought a resting-place and found
none to the right roared the eastward ways to the
left the ways in the opposite direction swarming
with people backwards and forwards along a cable
overhead rushed a string of gesticulating meji
dressed like clowns each marked on back and chest
with one gigantic letter so that altogether they spelt
out

purkinjes digestive pills

an anaemic little woman in horrible coarse blue can-
vas pointed a little girl to one of this string of hurry-
ing advertisements


amazing stories

  look said the anamiic woman thers yer
father

  which said the little girl

   tm wiv his nose colored red said the anaemic
woman

  the little girl began to cry and elizabeth could
have cried too

  aint e kickin is legs-just said the anaemic
woman in blue trying to make things bright again
looky-now

  on the facade to the right a huge intensely bright
disc of weird color span incessantly and letters of
fire that came and went spelt out-

does this make you giddy

then a pause followed by

take a purkinjes digestive pill

  a vast and desolating braying began if you love
swagger literature put your telephone on to drug-
gies the greatest author of all time the greatest
thinker of all time teaches you morals up to
your scalp the very image of socrates except
the back of his head which is like shakespeare he
has six toes dresses in red and never cleans his
teeth hear him

  dentons voice became audible in a gap in the
uproar i never ought to have married you he
was saying i have wasted your money ruined you
brought you to misery i am a scoundrel    oh
this accursed world

  she tried to speak and for some moments could
not she grasped his hand no she said at last

  a half-formed desire suddenly became determina-
tion she stood up will you come

  he rose also we need not go there yet

  not that but i want you to come to the flying
stages-where we met you know the little seat
fie hesitated caw you he said doubtfully
must she answered

  he hesitated still for a moment then moved to
obey her will

  and so it was they spent their last half-day of
freedom out under the open air in the little seat
under the flying stages where they had been wont
to meet five short years ago there she told him
what she could not tell him in the tumultuous public
ways that she did not repent even now of their mar-
riage-that whatever discomfort and misery life still
had for them she was content with the things that
had been the weather was kind to them the seat
was sunlit and warm and overhead the shining aero-
planes went and came

  at last towards sunsetting their time was at an
end and they made their vows to one another and
clasped hands and then rose up and went back into
the ways of the city a shabby-looking heavy-hearted
pair tired and hungry soon they came to one of
the pale blue signs that marked a labor company
bureau for a space they stood in the middle way
regarding this and at last descended and entered the
waiting room

the labor company had originally been a char-
itable organization its aim was to supply food
shelter and work to all comers this it was bound
to do by the conditions of its incorporation and it
was also bound to supply food and shelter and medi-
cal attendance to all incapable of work who chose to
demand its aid in exchange these incapables paid

labor notes which they had to redeem upon recovery
they signed these labor notes with thumb-marks
which were photographed and indexed in such a
way that this world-wide labor company could
identify any one of its two or three hundred million
clients at the cost of an hours inquiry the days
labor was defined as two spells in a treadmill used
in generating electrical force or its equivalent and
its due performance could be enforced by law in
practice the labor company found it advisable to
add to its statutory obligations ol food and shelter a
few pence a day as an inducement to effort and its
enterprise had not only abolished pauperization alto-
gether but supplied practically all but the very high-
est and most responsible labor throughout the world
nearly a third of the population of the world were
its serfs and debtors from the cradle to the grave

  in this practical unsentimental way the problem
of the unemployed had been most satisfactorily met
and overcome no one starved in the public ways
and no rags no costume less sanitary and sufficient
than the labor companys hygienic but inelegant
blue canvas pained the eye throughout the whole
world it was the constant theme of the phono-
graphic newspapers how much the world had pro-
gressed since nineteenth-century days when the
bodies of those killed by the vehicular traffic or dead
of starvation were they alleged a common feature
in all the busier streets

  denton and elizabeth sat apart in the waiting
room until their turn came most of the others
collccted there seemed limp and taciturn but three
or four young people gaudily dressed made up for
the quietude of their companions they were life
clients of the company born in the companys
creclie and destined to die in its hospital and they
had been out for a spree with some shillings or so of
extra pay they talked vociferously in a later devel-
opment of the cockney dialect manifestly very
proud of themselves

  elizabeths eyes went from these to the less assert-
ive figures one seemed exceptionally pitiful to
her it was a woman of perhaps forty-five with
gold-stained hair and a painted face down which
abundant tears had trickled she had a pinched nose
hungry eyes lean hands and shoulders and her
dusty worn-out finery told the story of her life
another was a grey-bearded old man in the costume
of a bishop of one of the high episcopal sects-for
religion was now also a business and had its ups
and downs and beside him a sickly dissipated-look-
ing boy of perhaps two-and-twenty glared at fate

  presently elizabeth and then denton interviewed
the manageress-for the company preferred women
in this capacity-and found she possessed an ener-
getic face a contemptuous manner and a particu-
larly unpleasant voice they were given various
checks including one to certify that they need not
have their heads cropped and when they had given
their thumb-marks learnt the number corresponding
thereunto and exchanged their shabby middle-class
clothes for duly numbered blue canvas suits they
repaired to the huge plain dining-room for their
first meal under these new conditions afterwards
they were to return to her for instructions about
their work

  when they had made the exchange of their cloth-
ing elizabeth did not seem able to look at denton at
first but he looked at her and saw with astonish-
ment that even in blue canvas she was still beautiful
a story of the days to come



and then their soup and bread came sliding on its
little rail down the long table towards them and
stopped with a jerk and he forgot the matter for
they had had no proper meal for three days

  after they had dined they rested for a time
neither talked-there was nothing to say and pres-
ently they got up and went back to the manageress
to learn what they had to do

  the manageress referred to a tablet yr rooms
wont be here itll be in the highbury ward ninety-
seventh way number two thousand and seventeen
better make a note of it on yr card you nought
nought nought type seven sixty-four bcd gamma
forty-one female you ave got to go to the metal-
beating company and try that for a day-fourpence
bonus if yere satisfactory and you nought seven
one type four seven hundred and nine gfb pi
five and ninety male you ave to go to the photo-
graphic company  eighty-first way and learn
something or other -  dont know - thrippence
eres yr cards thats all next what didnt
catch it all lor so suppose i must go over it all
again w hy dont you listen keerless improvi-
dent people oned think these things didnt matter

their ways to their work lay together for a
time and now they found they could talk
curiously enough the worst of their depression
seemed over now that they had actually donned the
blue denton could talk with interest even of the
work that lay before them whatever it is he
said it cant be so hateful as that hat shop and
after we have paid for dings we shall still have a
whole penny a day between us even now after-
wards-we may improve-get more money

  elizabeth was less inclined to speech i wonder
why work should seem so hateful she said

  its odd said denton i suppose it wouldnt
be if it were not the thought of being ordered about
   i hope wshall have decent managers

  elizabeth did not answer she was not thinking
of that she was tracing out some thoughts of her
own

  of course she said presently we have been
using up work all our lives its only fair-

  she stopped it was too intricate

  we paid for it said denton for at that time
he had not troubled himself about these complicated
things

  we did nothing-and yet we paid for it thats
what i cannot understand

  perhaps we are paying said elizabeth pres-
ently-for her theology was old-fashioned and
simple

  presently it was time for them to part and each
went to the appointed work dentons was to mind
a complicated hydraulic press that seemed almost an
intelligent thing this press worked by the sea-
water that was destined finally to flush the city
drains-for the world had long since abandoned the
folly of pouring drinkable water into its sewers
this water was brought close to the eastward edge of
the city by a huge canal and then raised by an
enormous battery of pupips into reservoirs at a level
of four hundred feet above the sea from which it
spread by a billion arterial branches over the city
thence it poured down cleansing sluicing working
machinery of all sorts through an infinite variety
of capillary channels into the great drains the

cloacae maximae and so carried the sewage out to
the agricultural areas that surrounded london on
every side

  the press was employed in one of the processes
of the photographic manufacture but the nature of
the process it did not concern denton to understand
the most salient fact to his mind was that it had to
be conducted in ruby light and as a consequence the
room in which he worked was lit by one colored
globe that poured a lurid and painful illumination
about the room in the darkest corner stood the
press whose servant denton had now become it was
a huge dim glittering thing with a projecting hood
that had a remote resemblance to a bowed head and
squatting like some metal buddha in this weird light
that ministered to its needs it seemed to denton in
certain moods almost as if this must needs be the
obscure idol to which humanity in some strange
aberration had offered up his life his duties had
a varied monotony such items as the following will
convey an idea of the service of the press the
thing worked with a busy clicking so long as things
went well but if the paste that came pouring through
a feeder from another room and which it was per-
petually compressing into thin plates changed in
quality the rhythm of its click altered and denton
hastened to make certain adjustments the slightest
delay involved a waste of paste and the docking of
one or more of his daily pence if the supply of
paste waned-there were hand processes of a peculiar
sort involved in its preparation and sometimes the
workers had convulsions which deranged their out-
put-denton had to throw the press out of gear in
the painful vigilance a multitude of such trivial
attentions entailed painful because of the incessant
effort its absence of natural interest required denton
had now to pass one-third of his days save for an
occasional visit from the manager a kindly but
singularly foul-mouthed man denton passed his
working hours in solitude

  elizabeths work was of a more social sort there
was a fashion for covering the private apartments
of the very wealthy with metal plates beautifully
embossed with repeated patterns the taste of the
time demanded however that the repetition of the
patterns should not be exact-not mechanical but
natural-and it was found that the most pleasing
arrangement of pattern irregularity was obtained by
employing women of refinement and natural taste
to punch out the patterns with small dies so many
square feet of plates was exacted from elizabeth as
a minimum and for whatever square feet she did in
excess she received a small payment the room like
most rooms of women workers was under fx man-
ageress  men had been found by the labor company
not only less exacting but extremely liable to excuse
favored ladies from a proper share of their duties
the manageress was a not unkindly taciturn person
with the hardened remains of beauty of the brunette
type and the other women workers who of course
hated her associated her name scandalously with one
of the metal-work directors in order to explain her
position

  only two or three of elizabeths fellovv-workers
were born labor serfs plain morose girls but most
of them corresponded to what the nineteenth century
would have called a reduced gentlewoman but
the ideal of what constituted a gentlewoman had

  principal or largest sewers


amazing stories

altered the faint faded negative virtue the modu-
lated voice and restrained gesture of the old-fash-
ioned gentlewoman had vanished from the earth
most of her companions showed in discolored hair
ruined complexions and the texture of their reminis-
cent conversations the vanished glories of a con-
quering youth all of these artistic workers were
much older than elizabeth and two openly expressed
their surprise that any one so young and pleasant
should come to share their toil but elizabeth did
not trouble them with her old-world moral con-
ceptions

they were permitted and even encouraged to
converse with each other for the directors very
properly judged that anything that conduced to vari-
ations of mood made for pleasing fluctuations in
their patterning and elizabeth was almost forced
to hear the stories of these lives with which her own
interwove garbled and distorted they were by van-
ity indeed and yet comprehensible enough and
soon she began to appreciate the small spites and
cliques the little misunderstandings and alliances
that enmeshed about her one woman was exces-
sively garrulous and descriptive about a wonderful
son of hers another had cultivated a foolish coarse-
ness of speech that she seemed to regard as the
wittiest expression of originality conceivable a third
mused for ever on dress and whispered tojilizabeth
how she saved her pence day after day jtnd would
presently have a glorious day of freedom wearing
   and then followed hours of description two
others sat always together and called one another
pet names until one day some little thing happened
and they sat apart blind and deaf as it seemed to
one anothers being and always from them all came
an incessant tap tap tap tap and the manageress
listened always to the rhythm to mark if one fell
away tap tap tap tap so their days passed so
their lives must pass elizabeth sat among them
kindly and quiet gray-hearted marveling at fate
tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap

  so there came to denton and elizabeth a long
succession of laborious days that hardened their
hands wove strange threads of some new and sterner
substance into the soft prettiness of their livesnd
drew grave lines and shadows on their faces the
bright convenient ways of the former life had re-
ceded to an inaccessible distance slowly they learnt
the lesson of the under-world-sombre and labori-
ous vast and pregnant there were many little
things happened  things that would be tedious and
miserable to tell things that were bitter and grievous
to bear-indignities tyrannies such as must ever
season the bread of the poor in cities and one thing
that was not little but seemed like the utter blacken-
ing of life to them which was that the child they
had given life to sickened and died but that story
that ancient perpetually recurring story has been
told so often has been told so beautifully that there
is no need to tell it over again here there was the
same sharp fear the same long anxiety the deferred
inevitable blow and the black silence it has always
been the same it will always be the same it is one
of the things that must be

  and it was elizabeth who was the first to speak
after an aching dull interspace of days not indeed
of the foolish little name that was a name no longer
but of the darkness that brooded over her soul they
had come through the shrieking tumultuous ways

of the city together the clamor of trade of yelling
competitive religions of political appeal had beat
upon deaf ears the glare of focussed lights of
dancing letters and fiery advertisements had fallen
upon the set miserable faces unheeded they took
their dinner in the dining-hall at a place apart i
want said elizabeth clumsily to go out to the
flying stages-to that seat here one can say
nothing   

  denton looked at her it will be night he said
i have asked-it is a fine night she stopped
he perceived she could find no words to explain
herself suddenly he understood that she wished to
see the stars once more the stars they had watched
together from the open downland in that wild honey-
moon of theirs five years ago something caught at
his throat he looked away from her

  there will be plenty of time to go he said in a
matter-of-fact tone

  and at last they came out to their little seat on
the flying stage and sat there for a long time in
silence the little seat was in shadow but the zenith
was pale blue with the effulgence of the stage over-
head and all the city spread below them squares
and circles and patches of brilliance caught in a
mesh-work of light the little stars seemed very
faint and small near as they had been to the old-
world watcher they had become now infinitely re-
mote yet one could see them in the darkened
patches amidst the glare and especially in the north-
ward sky the ancient constellations gliding steadfast
and patient about the pole

  long our two people sat in silence and at last
elizabeth sighed

  if i understood she said if i could under-
stand when one is down there the city seems
everything-the noise the hurry the voices-you
must live you must scramble here-it is nothing
a thing that passes one can think in peace
yes said denton how flimsy it all is from
here more than half of it is swallowed by the night
 it will pass

  we shall pass first said elizabeth

  i know said denton if life were not a mo-
ment the whole of history would seem like the
happening of a day  yes-we shall pass and the
city will pass and all the things that are to come
man and the overman and wonders unspeakable
and yet   

  he paused and then began afresh i know what
you feel at least i fancy  down there one thinks
of ones work ones little vexations and pleasures
ones eating and drinking and ease and pain one
lives and one must die down there and everyday
-our sorrow seemed the end of life   

  up here it is different for instance down there
it would seem impossible almost to go on living if
one were horribly disfigured horribly crippled dis-
graced up here-under these stars-none of those
things would matter they dont matter    they
are a part of something one seems just to touch
that something-under the stars   

  he stopped the vague impalpable things in his
mind cloudy emotions half shaped towards ideas
vanished before the rough grasp of words it is
hard to express he said lamely

  they sat through a long stillness

  it is well to come here he said at last we
stop-our minds are very finite after all we are
just poor animals rising out of the brute each with
a story of the days to come



a mind the poor beginning of a mind we are so
stupid so much hurts and yet 

  i know i know-and some day we shall see

  all this frightful stress all this discord will re-
solve to harmony and we shall know it nothing is
but it makes for that nothing all the failures-
every little thing makes for that harmony every-
thing is necessary to it we shall find we shall find
nothing not even the most dreadful thing could be
left out not even the most trivial every tap of
your hammer on the brass every moment of work

my idleness even    dear one every movement of
our poor little one  all these things go on for ever
and the faint impalpable things we sitting here
together-everything   

  the passion that joined us and what has come
since it is not passion now more than anything
else it is sorrow dear  

  he could say no more could follow his thoughts
no further

  elizabeth made no answer-she was very still
but presently her hand sought his and found it

the fallacy in ten million miles sunward

  by prof w j luyten

   of harvard college observatory cambridge mass

            it is with a feeling of gratification that we publish for the benefit of our readers the interesting note
        from professor luyten pointing out the fallacy in the story ten million miles sunward a
        force coming from the outside is essential to change the earths orbit and it will be observed that the
        energy involved in a tremendous rapidity of flow of water into the caspian sea or the discharge of some
        inconceivably great projectile would bring to bear a force from the outside we naturally cannot and do
        not wish to add anything to professor luytens very clear and comprehensive statement

           in connection with the idea of discharging projectiles we may refer to jules verns story the pur-
        chase of the north pole in our issues of september and october  here in order to shift the north
        pole jules vernes scientists discharge an enormous projectile into space in exact accordance with pro-
        fessor luytens statement jules verne in his story however assumed that the people of his tale merely
        desired to shift the north pole toward the temperate zone and not to divert the earth from its orbir

astronomically speaking the
thing is totally unsound it is en-
tirely impossible to change the course of
the earth i mean in its path around the
sun by doing anything from the earth
itself to change the earths orbit would
require a force coining from the outside
at the most we could do a little toward
it by breaking the earth in two then the
two bits might very well pursue another
orbit the fundamental law of mechan-
ics is that the centre of gravity of the
earth will remain in its orbit so long as
only interior forces act and in the case
of the caspian adventure we are dealing
with a purely interior force besides
the shifting of the centre of gravity on
its account would he very small

  if the water flowed from the black
sea into the caspian at a tremendous
rate of speed it might for the time being
slow down the rotation of the earth a
little and make the day a few seconds

longer but would have no further effect
after the caspian had been filled up the
rotation would come back to practically
the same value it had before also in
such a case if the earth swerved at all
from its course it would do that gradu-
ally and not suddenly

  if we were really in the predicament
proposed by the author of ten million
miles sunward our only salvation would
lie in shooting off enormous projectiles
in the direction opposite to the way we
wanted to go this is essentially a force
from the outside

  concerning the black sea-caspian con-
nection it might he of interest to know
that there is a canal between the rivers
don and volga thereby connecting these
two seas at least so i was told when i
was in russia last summer i do not
think however that the thing is  any
large scale and probably too high up to
fill the caspian with black sea water

author of the revolt of the pedestrians

nless the unexpected happened mo-
ronia would le destroyed the last war
had destroyed many of her young men
ruined her finances and deprived her
people of even a hope for better years to
come the kingdom of eupcnia now completely
surrounded moronia shutting off on all sides her
commerce and intercourse with friendly nations
the next war would end the struggle and strife that
had lasted for centuries

  like a previous conqueror premier plautz arose
day after day in the eupenian senate to croak out
his celebrated quadruple-worded threat-a threat
that he hoped some day would e fulfilled prophecy
moronia must le destroyed he cried and the
eupenians drunk with success and power answered
with renewed plaudits and increased appropriations
for the final struggle moronia must be destroyed
he said on the st of september - she lies in
the middle of our fair country like a dreaded and
threatening cancer we have cut off her commerce
and bled her manpower white now is the time to
destroy her and occupy her farms and cities with our
own deserving populace moronia must be destroyed
our army hopes to occupy her capital by christmas
day after such a victory we will have good reason
to celebrate the birthday of our master from that
day on the word moronia will only be a memory and
a warning-a memory of
our power and a warning
to any future enemy mo-
ronia must be destroyed

moronia shall be de-
stroyed 

  immediately after this
short address the senate
adjourned t h e w a r
council met that after-
noon to perfect plans for
the next war as yet unde-
clared just as he did in
the senate premier plautz
dominated this body at
once he asked the chief of

the air service if his corps was prepared for war

  we are your excellency was the unexpected
reply from colonel von dort we are prepared for
war but we are also prepared for more than the at-
tack i have in readiness one thousand planes each
manned by two experienced aviators at your com-
mand the air service will begin the assault but t
warn you in advance that we will lose one thousand
planes and two thousand men at the first attack we
are prepared-for death

  that is the speech of a coward are all of the

corps like you  demanded premier plautz i am
informed the moronians have only a few air craft
of what arc you afraid

  we fear nothing replied von dort white with
suppressed anger but we know the truth since the
last war moronia has perfected some kind of a light-
ray a machine is placed every mile along their en-
tire border from these machines the rays go out
presumably in a fan shape when the raystrikes an
airplane the engine not only stops but apparently
explodes no one knows how high in the air these
rays go-we have never been able to rise above the
range of their power we have been experimenting
and have found no way of defending the plane
against the ray so far twenty of our planes dis-
guised as commercial machines have been destroyed
and our aviators killed in every instance the bodies
were brought to the frontier by the moronians and
each time they have simply explained that something
went wrong with the machinery and the plane
dropped in their country we have every reason to
believe that they have perfected some power which
will render impossible any attack on the enemy by
air what happened to twenty planes will hapjen to
a thousand that is why i said my corps was pre-
pared for death

  the premier started to pound the table with his
fist why was i not informed of this what has
been done to protect our
machines  the destruction
of one plane w enough
to justify a new war
what have you been doing
besides skulking in
cowardice

   i made daily reports to
the chief of staff re-
torted von dort the en-
tire matter is on record
for a month our depart-
ment of physics and
chemistry has been work-
ing on this problem they
thought they had a satis-
factory defense and the last ten planes were sup-
posed to have been protected but they crumpled like
the first ten

   colonel von dort is right interrupted the chief
of staff general hurlung all reports have been
filed regularly and a dailv summary lias been sent to
your office after all it is a purely military problem
we still have the other arms of the service the cal-
vary artillery and infantry with our calvary alone
we could overrun moronia we need not worry
about the air service

 yrou have of course read dr kellers story the
  revolt of the pedestrians which we printed in the
 february issue literally thousands of letters were re-
 ceived by us commenting upon this unusual story this
 month dr keller comes to the fore aoaiit with a tale
 which will range easily as one of the best scientifiction
 stones of  for sheer originality daring of thought
 and uniqueness this story is outstanding it contains good
 science for the yeast men actually could perform all the
 things that dr keller so vividly portrays here

   modern uxirfart is very much as is described by this in-
 teresting author gas has been introduced only during the
 last war and we may be surf that situations such as dr
 keller depicts will come about soon enough


the whole resistance was hopeless the yeast men arrived day after day in increasing numbers and they could not be killed they
could be mutilated dissevered decapitated but each piece lived and moved onwards    what use cutting a thing to pieces when each
piece kept on living and advancing how could an enemy be killed when it could not bleed

                                     


amazing stories

  oh i suppose so i suppose so replied the
premier petulantly still i wanted to blow them
into hell with air bombs-all of them men women
and children

  but if you did that you would also destroy prop-
erty argued general hurlung the infantry can
wipe- out the population just as effectively without
the loss of a single structure what worries me is
this they have a powerful ray of some kind which
we know can destroy a plane at ten thousand feet
suppose they turn these rays sidewise on our advanc-
ing army what will happen

  bah you are growing old general sneered
the premier have we not the artillery to blast our
way through such infernal machines our infantry
are men not machines they can live through any
kind of hell-fire and win the victory i am fretted
at the atmosphere of doubt that covers this council of
war we will attack on the first of october open-
ing with artillery following with calvary and mop-
ping up with the infantry these machines you
dread so much are only machines and all machines
must be run by men kill the men and the machines
are harmless general hurlung you will prepare
all branches of the army for the attack colonel
von dort you are dismissed from the service for
cowardice go where you please but if you are in
eupenia at the end of two days i will have you
shot

  von dort drawing his dress sword broke it over
his knee and threw the pieces on the table in front of
the premier said von dort a country that thus
rewards honesty is a land rotten to the core the
men around the table kept an awkward silence as he
left the room

  premier plautz stood up you gentlemen know
what to do i will accept no excuses for incompe-
tency moronia must be destroyed we will meet
again a week from today the secret service had
better follow von dort and imprison him i do not
trust him keep him in solitary confinement and i
will deal finally with him in a few days

  von dort however was already in his automobile
leaving eupenia as fast as he could he paused at
his home only long enough to almost throw his wife
and baby and a few valuables into his car then he
started for moronia at seventy miles an hour von
dort was thoroughly mad for ten years he had
served in the air service of eupenia advancing slowly
from mechanician to chief of the service during
that time he had done his best under his leadership
the corps had achieved the finest type of morale he
knew that his men were always ready to gamble on a
chance in war but he could not sit still and see his
entire force sent to what he felt was certain death
during his ten years of military service he had had
ample chance to study the premier he knew that
every man who had dared to oppose plautz had come
to an unfortunate end disgrace exile or death life
to von dort with his wife and baby was too sweet
to be sacrificed unless absolutely necessary the for-
mer chief of the air service fully realized all this
he increased the speed of his car moronia was his
destination for other reasons than because it was the
nearest border he felt that he could trust them as
enemies more than he could trust the other nation
who were friendly to eupenia also his wife had
come from that nation she was the daughter of a
former moronian general who died in the last wrar

von dort had been a memer of the army of occupa-
tion and once having met this particular young lady
all his loyalty to eupenia was insufficient to prevent
him from falling in love he felt that if he had to
die it would be better to die with his wife and baby
in the mountains of moronia than in solitude in an
eupenian prison

the radio message beat them to the frontier and
von dort saw that the barricade had been low-
ered it was a sturdy wooden gate but the automo-
bile hit it going eighty miles an hour and reduced it
to kindling the car finally stopped rather dis-
heveled in looks but with the motor still running one
mile inside moronia there von dort stopped as
soon as possible having a deep respect for the vigi-
lance and accurate shooting of the moronia border
patrol he did not wish to arouse their suspicion in
any way the car was soon surrounded by cavalry-
men who politely but firmly asked for full details as
to his identity and reason for entering the country in
such a precipitous manner realizing that there was
no reason for deceit he gave them a brief account of
his trouble and asked to be taken to the general-in-
chief of the moronian army

  moronia nominally a monarchy was in every re-
spect democratic except that it had a king every
citizen felt an equal amount of reverence and fra-
ternity for this monarch there was rank both in
civil and military life but promotion was by merit
and without either syncophancy or tyranny conse-
quently it was easier to see the commanding gen-
eral in moronia than it was to see the third assist-
ant secretary of agriculture in eupenia the mo-
ronians lived among the mountains and like the
eagles of the crags prized their liberty in conse-
quence of all this it was only a few hours before von
dort was telling his story to general androvitz and
his staff

  they believed all that he said especially did they
believe him after his wife talked to them in their
native patois there were some present who had
known her father well one old officer was even able
to remember the celebration of her christening the
general discussion was finally ended by von dort

  i fled because i knew that premier plautz in-
tended to have me killed and i came here because of
my wife and because i felt keenly the injustice of
another war moronia is to lie destroyed for no
other reason than selfishness and greed the force
against you is overwhelming i see nothing save
our final and complete destruction i f i have to die
 want to die fighting rather than die in a prison or
shot or hanged like a criminal i offer you my serv-
ices general androvitz and am willing to serve your
country in any capacity

  the general at once sent for the king to join their
deliberations rudolph hubelaire came a little
withered one-armed man with the fire of a lion in
his eye he heard the news without changing ex-
pression the other men watched him anxiously
finally he spoke

  we can die hut once resistance in our weak-
ened state will be but a grand gesture eupenia may
conquer the country but she will never enslave our
patriots they and their families may die but they
will never surrender when the time comes we will
fight when that is over the survivors will retire to
our mountain forts there we will live with the
the yeast men



goats and chamois i am sorry that it all has to end
thus hut we have done our best one more inven-
tion like our ultra-light rays would have saved us-
but our scientists have done their best and as we
have failed so have they colonel von dort we
trust your honesty and welcome you to our ranks
your desire to die on the field of battle will probably
be realized

  the meeting was just breaking up each participant
ready to carry the sad news to his friends when the
guard at the door announced the presence of mr
billings one of monrovias staff of scientific investi-
gators

  poor billings said the king a harmless fellow
from america he has worked in our laboratory for
years without pay except for his bare expenses and
he is about broken-hearted because so far he has
failed to make any discovery of importance i wish
we could get him back to america before war begins
let us humor the old gentleman and listen to his
story i want you to show his age the proper respect
let there be no levity his loyalty and faithful en-
deavor demand our greatest courtesy

  billings came in and was seated by the king he
was stooped-shouldered bald and trembling his
high-pitched voice cracked like static under his ex-
citement

  your majesty and gentlemen he said after
years of the most tedious experimentation i have
finally discovered a method of defending ourselves
against the eupenians

  fine said the king now tell us all about it
i propose that we make an army of yeast men
that is a fine idea mr billings said the king
soothingly i am sure that your discovery has
merit now i want you to go over to america and
take a long vacation and after you are thoroughly
rested you can come back and visit us again

  but you do not understand pleaded the old man
i suppose you think that i am senile the inven-
tion is complete and i am sure it will work it is
practical and simple the one machine i have made
functions perfectly it can easily be duplicated and
anyone can run it all we need is an abundance of
yeast and hundreds of machines you shoot the lit-
tle fellows out like bullets from a machine gun
well what happens then asked general andro-
vitz

  they just grow and walk around a little and then
they die

  if they do that they will be typical soldiers in-
terrupted the chief of the artillery service that
is about all we will do between now and christmas
but in dying they will win the victory eagerly
chirped the inventor in his high-pitched cricket
voice cannot you understand that they will die
and rot in eupenia

  the king gently took the old man by the shoulder
and as he talked the tears came to his eyes

        y dear billings the thing you describe is
lvl just a soldier for hundreds of years the
moronians have died in defense of their country
they had died and rotted and yet we as a nation
have slowly withered away brave men by the thou-
sand have done just that and to what avail your
eagerness to help has worried you sick go and take
a long rest yeast men and real men may die and rot
but our dear moronia is doomed

but cannot you see it pleaded the inventor
oh please try to see it yeast men by the mil-
lions and billions walking into eupenia and rotting
there cannot you see how it is going to work 

 i beg your pardon asked general androvitz
 but did you say billions

 i did a few drops of yeast grows to be a soldier
 six feet tall give me as many machines as those you
 made to generate the anti-aircraft rays and i will
 produce yeast men by the million i will make a
 million every day as long as it is necessary

 and they live just so long and then die asked
 the king

 yes they live about three days during that time
 they are able to move about twenty-five miles then
 they die and rot

 a fairy tale said the premier who up to this
 time had kept silent

 but i can prove it i have made one if you see
 just one of them will you believe it let me show
 you just one

 the king held up his hand for silence
 gentlemen let me talk to billings please do not
 interrupt he is nervous-and so am i we must
 get to the real truth in this matter i would never
 forgive myself if he really found something of value
 and lost it because of our incredulity now friend
 billings let us pretend that we are alone pay no
 attention to these other men listen to my questions
 and answer them as simply as you can remember
 that i am not a scientist and do not understand big
 words now how much yeast does it take to make
 a soldier

 about two drops

 how big does he grow

 about six feet tall

 do they look like real men 

 just a little you see they are made of dough
 do they walk as we do

 no it is sort of a creeping shuffle-amoeba
 movement

 if they are not destroyed how long will they
 live 

 about three days

 what happens then 

 they cease to grow or move they die and de-
 cay-rot

 suppose one of them is shot or has his head cut
 off with a saber or is torn into pieces by a cannon
 ball what then

 each piece would keep on living and growing
 and moving till the end of the third day

 you said they would move at eight miles an
 hour

 yes if nothing stopped them they would be
 in eupenia at the end of forty-eight hours and by the
 end of the third day they would rot there

 are you sure of all this

 it worked out in the laboratory

 what makes them grow

 it is a peculiar form of yeast in the machine
 we compress it just as soon as it is liberated it be-
 gins to extract nitrogen from the air and expands
 it not only expands but it actually grows by the
 rapid division of the yeast cells

 i do not understand it said the king but i am
 willing to take your word for it what makes them
 move 

 radiant energy before the yeast is put into the


amazing stories

 guns it is thoroughly energized with a form of
 radium

  liut these peculiar creatures cannot fight they
have no weapons how can they win a war

  by their rotting your majesty  have tried to
make that plain to you they die and rot

  you mean they decay

  exactly they dissolve into pools of slime they
form a puddle about three feet in diameter and
weighing about thirty pounds

  how would such decaying masses stop an invad-
ing army

   it is their stench that will stop them the yeast
is mixed with culture of bacillus butericus and
other foetid germs these grow in the dying and
dead yeast and produce the smell

   that may be true but your idea that it will stop
an army is all nonsense no soldier was checked just
by a smell

  but this will stop them i have a little bottle
here it has one drop of the end slime diluted a
thousand times have one of your officers smell it
any volunteers asked the king

  certainly answered the chief of artillery i
have been in three wars and have smelled everything
horrible known to any form of campaign it will
never hurt me

   the inventor held the opened bottle under the mili-
tary mans nose roughly the soldier took two deep
smells then billings corked the bottle while the
volunteer slumped from the chair down to the floor
and lay there white sweating and vomiting the
others hastened to help him loosen his collar

  my god exclaimed the king just two whiffs
from a bottle containing a thousandth of a drop and
each dead yeast man produces thirty pounds of the
stuff will it kill 

  not men but plants was billings reply look
at this he emptied the bottle on a large clay jar
holding a blooming cyclamen at once the plant
withered and died a curious foetid smell filled the
room the king rose hastily and sought an opened
window so did the rest seek doors and open win-
dows while carrying the fainting chief of the artil-
lery service with them

  as soon as they got outside the room in the pure
air the king turned to the inventor

  show me just one man like those you describe
mr billings-just one man and the resources of the
kingdom are at your command

  i have made them i have one now that is nearly
three days old my assistants have been leading him
around an old deserted race track you see they go
in a straight line unless they are led and the only
way we could keep him under observation was to
lead him around in a track

  we will go and see him said the king and we
will take with us the professor of mathematics from
the university gentlemen follow us in your cars
the party reassembled at an old race track over-
grown with grass and a quarter mile in circumfer-
ence slowly walking around this track was an
assistant from the morovian laboratories other
men were resting on a bench the walking man held
a rope and was leading by it a peculiar creature it
was an yeast man

imagine a six-foot man of dough with a crust
hard enough to hold it erect yet viscid enough to

allow it to move forward a creature with a head
but no face with spade-like hands without fingers
and instead of two legs and feet simply-simply a
body like a skirt which rested firmly on the ground
on a two-foot base it was the convulsive movement
of this base and the mass of fermenting yeast above
it that in some way enabled it to move slowly over
the ground it was such a creature with a broad
canvas band around its waist that the morovians saw
being led around the track mr billings ran for-
ward eagerly and conferred with his men then he
returned to the group of officers surrounding the
king

  they report that it had gone around the track
ninety-nine times that is twenty-three miles and
nearly twenty-four it was four feet tall at the end
of the first day and at the end of the second day it
was full grown it is now nearly three days old
and if our calculations are correct it will soon die
the yeast man slowly moved around the track
just in front of the tumbled-down grandstand it
stopped billings instructed his men to take off the
canvas belt the party gathered around the motion-
less figure suddenly it began to grow shorter and
stouter it swayed and finally out of balance started
to fall forward bending at the waist an unpleasant
odor filled the air suddenly it bent double and
literally melted into a pool of greenish yellow slime
the odor grew increasingly frightful so that it drove
the observers further and yet further away the
grass touched by the slime withered and died

  the king turned to the professor of mathematics
professor he said estimate the size of that pud-
dle multiply it by five billion estimate the terri-
tory filled with that odor suppose swh masses five
billion such masses were scattered equally over
eupenia what would be the result 

  the professor figured on the back of an old en-
velope he used the stub of a short pencil which he
nervously stuck in his mouth after every fifth figure
finally he said if you could arrange to have them
die at different places the whole of eupenia would
be covered about six inches deep

  the king turned to his staff

  i am satisfied gentlemen we will have hun-
dreds of these machines made and when we are
ready to begin operations mr billings can make
five thousand yeast men to start with our citizens
can lead them for three days and just as they are
about to die we will turn them loose on all the high-
ways and open spaces leading to eupenia at the
same time we will start making them by the million
our attack will come before the enemys ready if
it works we will obtain a bloodless victory the only
way we can make a success of it is to spring it on
them as a total surprise cut all the wires leading to
eupenia confiscate at once all the radio sets be
more careful than ever in watching the suspected
spies it would not be a bad idea to imprison them
till this is over put a triple guard on the border
permit no intercommunication turn over the en- 
tire resources of the kingdom to mr billings and his
associates at the same time do not omit a single
item leading to the preparedness of our little army

i understood von dort to say that we would be at-
tacked on the first of october we will attack be-
fore then-just as soon as billings is ready have
any of you a suggestion

  yes said the chief of artillery still pale and
the yeast men



sweating frotn his recent nausea why not let me
follow the yeast men up and blow them to pieces
with shrapnel make five yeast pieces and five
stench pots out of each yeast man

  i think replied the king that the eupenians
will be only too anxious to do that work for us
again i repeat gentlemen that we must observe the
greatest secrecy keep the anti-aircraft machines in
constant operation especially on cloudy days may
god save our country and bless our good friend mr
billings now gentlemen to work day and night
without rest to make this machinery gather an
abundance of material and train men to use the
machines

near every road connecting the two coun-
tries large canvas camouflage screens were
erected captive observation balloons sent up by the
eupenian air service reported no massing of mo-
ronian troops behind these canvas screens how-
ever thousands of the men and women of the little
mountain kingdom took turns leading five thousand
yeast men in their monotonous journey toward
death all day and all night on the th th and
th of september these five thousand yeast men
moved and grew behind the protecting curtains
their genesis had been so timed that at dusk on the
third day they were two days twenty-three hours
and thirty minutes old then they were turned loose
on the main highways and were started on their
slow shuffle toward eupenia some of course were
checked at the border barricades others crawled
around or over and had advanced several hundred
yards into the enemys country before dissolution
occurred

  in the meantime peculiar-looking machine guns
were being placed at intervals of one mile each
manned by a group of trained moronian soldiers
these guns were simple in construction and mounted
on sturdy tripods above each was a small hopper
from which yeast was fed to a small but powerful
press operated by condensed air each blow of the
ram produced a yeast man one-eighth of an inch
high these were dropped into the barrel of the
gun and were blown out into the air several hundred
feet away from the gun like thistle down they
floated gradually dropping to the ground base down-
ward and head erect immediately on touching the
earth they began their peculiar shuffling movement
which was to continue in the exact direction in which
they had started as the guns worked they revolved
slowly through a forty-five degree horizontal arc

  each gun fired two yeast men a second that
meant one hundred and twenty a minute seven thou-
sand two hundred an hour or  in the course
of twenty-four hours there were seven hundred
guns made but only about five hundred were in
actual use at any one time the others acting as re-
placements counting the total time these five hun-
dred guns were in use it was later estimated that
they were fired about ten days this made a total
of  for each gun or a grand total of eight
hundred and sixty-four million yeast men manufac-
tured during the campaign each yeast man dead
produced thirty pounds of end-slime a total of -

	tons it will be remembered that this slime
in a one-to-a-thousand dilution was sufficiently
strong to produce disabling vomiting

  these guns began operations twenty-four hours

before the five thousand fully-grown yeast men
were liberated they then moved slowly forward
and behind them came successive waves of smaller
and yet smaller men of dough at the end of the
first twenty-four hours the oldest of the yeast men
who had been shot from the five hundred guns were
nearly four feet high the woods and fields of
eupenia bordering on moronia were dotted with the
peculiar creatures

  the statement made by mr billings that he would
be able to manufacture them by the billions never
materialized the machines worked more slowly
than he had anticipated it was also seen that a
large number were caught in trees and ravines and
were unable to continue their march yet a sufficient
number reached the smooth highways and level pas-
tures to do everything that was required of them
also the work was facilitated later in the campaign
by mounting the guns in airplanes and literally
showering the towns and cities with the little fellows
this however was not attempted till it was seen
that the morale of the eupenians was completely de-
stroyed

during the entire campaign not a single mo-
ronian died of injuries incident to warfare
though time and again many of them fell exhausted
from lack of sleep the radium workers not only
received painful burns but were affected for several
years as the result of the prolonged exposure to the
mysterious emanations from the weird element
these however were but slight horrors of war com-
pared with what might have happened had the eu-
penian attack found the moronians in their previous
defenseless condition

   during september  all had been active in the
kingdom dominated by premier plautz who was the
real ruler of eupenia in place of the feeble-minded
king all branches of the army including the avia-
tion section had been mobilized fifty thousand
trained and well-armed men were in camp ready to
begin the destruction of the little mountainous king-
dom of moronia the attack was timed to begin on
the first of october premier plautz no longer was
content with his usual statement that moronia must
be destroyed he was now saying that the time had
come for the actual work of destruction to begin
an interesting fact was that the escape of col
von dort and his admission into moronia as a place
of refuge was to be made the actual causa belli on
the thirtieth of september his surrender was to be
demanded within twenty-four hours if it were
not conceded the eupenian army would at once
advance if the demand were complied with the
army would advance anyway moronia as far as
premier plautz was concerned had to be destroyed

  a broad highway connected the capital cities of
the two kingdoms this was the road used by von
dort in his dramatic flight for safety it was here
at the border that he had crashed through the bar-
ricade at this point the eupenian border guard
was commanded by lieutenant kraut and under
him was a company of ninety privates and non-
commissioned officers on the evening of the nine-
teenth of september the lieutenant was writing his
daily report and wishing for something to happen to
relieve the deadly monotony of daily routine just
as he had finished this report and was signing it a
sentry rushed in and stated that a number of pecul-


amazing stories

iar looking naked men were at the boundary gate
trying to enter the country suspecting a trap the
lieutenant at once called his entire force to arms
and personally investigated the matter when he
approached the barricade he was astonished to see
a number of grayish white creatures six feet high
moving aimlessly on the other side of the gate they
had heads without features bodies without legs arms
without fingers cautiously he touched one and
shivered at the peculiar soft sensation that was im-
parted by the animals skin realizing that his men
were watching him closely and that any sign of
nervousness on his part would be communicated to
them and feeling certain too that each of the
peculiar shapes was but a mask and cloak for a
moronian soldier he drew his revolver and shot
one of the odd things several times through the
heart section the bullet holes closed anctuiere was
no blood the thing kept on with its curious shuf-
fling movement

  attention men he commanded open the
gates and we will take them all prisoners god
knows what they are but they cannot hurt us any-
way and we will hold them till to-morrow and then
send them in trucks to the general-in-chief

  his men obeyed the command but there were many
more of the new creatures than there were soldiers
and thus while over seventy were captured several
hundred passed the barricade and started moving
down the road

  in the guard-house the telephone was ringing
violently headquarters wanted to know if any-
thing new had developed and whether lieut kraut
and his command were safe disquieting messages
were being received from the other outposts and
they wanted an immediate report lieut kraut
started to tell about the peculiar things he had cap-
tured and the major at the other end of the line
reprimanded him for being drunk again the lieu-
tenant protested that he was perfectly sober the
major demanded an exact description of the new
animal the lieutenant had one brought into his
office and held near his desk while he gave a verbal
description over the telephone even while he was
talking the animal softened and started to melt the
lieutenant described the process as long as he could
talk even while writhing  the floor in deadly
nausea and vomiting he tried to tell what had hap-
pened but his retching only convinced the major
at headquarters that the lieutenant was beastly
drunk finally the lieutenant was dragged out of
the office by two of his men who waded through
pools of indescribable filth to rescue him he was
too sick to realize that his entire command had fled
from the post though here and there one of the
soldiers lay on the road too sick to move outside
the road was impassable on account of the puddles
of slime which dotted it cursing and vomiting
the lieutenant staggered through the dark woods
seeking pure air and freedom from the stench which
even in memory produced a recurrence of the pros-
trating nausea

  meantime those of the novel creatures who still
lived were shuffling slowly down the broad highway
every few minutes losing one of their number by
death and decay in the dark hours of the night
they died unseen and unmourned but each of them
left behind a horrible evidence that they had once
lived over the pools of slime others of their kind

walked some three feet high others a foot high and
here and there could be seen midgets only a few
inches high but resembling their larger brothers in
every detail when the sun rose there also arose
from every road between the two kingdoms the
smell of death a million times magnified it was
as though moronia were surrounded by a circle of
decay three miles deep meantime the smaller
younger yeast men were advancing into eupenia
through the woods and meadows tumbling into
ravines catching fast in trees and bushes falling
into streams and being swept away in the current
and yet ever with a sound like soft snow falling the
little ones new born were floating down through the
air like goose down and on and on the machines
along the border of moronia kept up their gentle
thump-thump-thump and with each thump was cre-
ated one more new life one more soldier brainless
fearless bloodless filled with the urge to keep on
moving till dissolution came and they all moved
downhill from the mountainous moronia into the
enemies more level country they were perfect
soldiers

  all the eupenian out-posts had experienced the
same novel sensations and made the same report that
was made by lieutenant kraut as soon as he was
able to talk none of the officers who came to head-
quarters to report could produce any proof that
they really had seen such massive monstrosities
every officer had to periodically stop his verbal re-
port till another period of vomiting had passed the
commander-in-chief thoroughly believed that they
had gone drunk and insane through the effects of
cheap whiskey and put them all under arrest at
the same time he sent several spies on motor-cycles
to make a thorough investigation these returned
babbling hysterically of an army of creatures of
all sizes and every spy was vomiting with the same
enthusiastic persistency that the officers had shown
the commander-in-chief began to curse the morals
of his army and went and started to get drunk
himself

  even then eupenia might have saved herself
though it is a question as to just how efficacious any
campaign of shrapnel or any building of fences or
digging of ditches would have proved what really
happened was no doubt inevitable yet the fact re-
mains and it is of historical importance that twenty-
four hours passed before any offensive was started
data was gathered and observations and lengthy re-
ports were made otherwise nothing was done
these reports especially from the border regions
were of such a varied and fantastic nature that little
value could be placed on them

finally premier plautz decided to personally
investigate the situation he took with him the
chief-of-staff and a group of scientists from the
university they found the new creatures by the
hundreds of thousands and of all sizes they also
came as near as they could to several of the puddles
of end-slime an effort to observe these carefully
with the aid of gas masks was useless even when
some of the foetid material was gathered at the end
of a long pole it could not be brought close enough
to make any observations of value several of the
things were carefully studied both chemically and
anatomically but not a single observer connected the
moving oddities with the pools of decay it must
the yeast men



be remembered that after the first hour of the offen-
sive no more yeast men had died and the reports
of the rapid dissolution of the first wave were en-
tirely discredited

   for the first time in his life premier plautz was
at a loss to know what to do to him the entire
situation was incomprehensible at one side of his
automobile a five foot abortion was slowly moving
its featureless face asking only one question why
was i made in the premiers hand was a watch
crystal and on the glass was a new creation barely
a quarter of an inch high in every respect the exact
duplicate of its brother standing by the side of the
car	x

  what does this mean professor owens the
puzzled premier asked the chemistry teacher
what kind of things are these they cannot fight
they have no weapons no brains no blood all
they know is how to grow and move forward evi-
dently they come from moronia but for what reason
is it a declaration of war

  the old professor answered to the best of his
ability and what he said was surprisingly near the
truth

  they are just yeast men your excellency i
have examined them in every way chemically and
microscopically and they are just peculiarly shaped
masses of dough animated by some very active
yeast their movements resemble dough overflow-
ing a pan  do not know what they mean but i do
know what they are i have had one cut up and
baked in loaves and it tastes like a fairly good kind
of whole wheat bread

   here the chief-of-staff interrupted

   of course we could consider it as a declaration
of war and attack but what would be the influence
on the worlds opinion of us reporters would
rush in from the paris and london papers they
would make us a laughing stock of the universe
what could we say that we were afraid of lumps
of yeast that wc were using our artillery on po-
tential loaves of bread so far these creatures
have not committed a single deprivation no lives
have been lost not a house burned not a single pig
or chicken killed think what a reporter from an
american paper would do to us if he had a chance
to write it up how he would describe our infantry
pouring bullets into dough our brave cavalry men
cutting the heads off of bread men far better
would it be to take them as fast as we can and dis-
tribute them among all of our people and let them
make bread with them that would be a joke the
eupeivan nation being fed at the expense of the
very enemy who hates them so

     believe you are right answered the premier
there is certainly nothing in such creatures to be
afraid of though their number seems to be increas-
ing hourly it was all well enough for the ignorant
peasants to run in terror from their farms but the
city folk will look on it as a great joke-especially
if we use the proper kind of propaganda suppose
we go back at once to the capitol and prepare a
statement for the press

   the next edition of the staatsbote the leading
afternoon paper in eupenia ran the following news
item on the front page

have you a little yeast man
in your home if not

why not

    all citizens are urged to at once provide
  their homes with one or more yeast men
  these peculiar creatures arc very harmless
  and the department of chemical research
  assures us that they make a very fair quality
  of bread they come in all sizes when
  little your children can play with them as
  dolls when full sized they can reduce the
  high cost of living

    all citizens having automobiles are com-
  manded to go into the country regions and
  bring to their homes as many of these yeast
  men as they can accommodate bring extra
  ones for your poorer neighbor

    army trucks will make regular trips to
  bring these yeast men to the capitol after
  they are paraded through the streets they
  will be distributed to all families not yet
  provided

   this item was published on the afternoon of the
second day all that afternoon and evening thou-
sands of yeast men were brought into the towns
and cities of eupenia in private automobiles and
army trucks the premier quick to act for his
personal advantage issued an order canceling all
contracts forflour and directing that the army be
supplied with bread baked from the dough creatures
each company in the army was directed to forage
for its own supply and to keep them in their tents
till they were needed for baking bread

  the next morning which was the beginning of
the third day of the moronian offensive thousands
of the yeast men were exhibited in parade through
the streets of the eupenian capital each one in
charge of a soldier the citizens laughed till they
cried at the comical spectacle and slapped each other
on the back as they pointed out the only kind of
soldiers moronia could attack with within a few
hours it became quite the fashion to have your own
jiersonal yeast man children walked around lead-
ing their little dough pets high school pupils
painted theirs with the class colors and numerals
these things could be led and guided herr schmidt
honorable president of the ancient order of eu-
penian cab drivers made a harness for a pair and
had them draw a light buggy through the streets
with his grandson for driver

   that third day was a fete day for all eupenia
the premier however had gone to unnecessary
labor to bring the yeast men into the city by noon
they were beginning to arrive of their own accord
by the hundreds of thousands by afternoon the
streets were crowded with them instead of being
a joke this thing was becoming a problem they
were gathered into the parks thrown into the cellars
herded out into the country but still they came in
increasing numbers every house had one or more
not a basement but was filled with a reserve supply
the barracks and tents of the army were overrun
the morning paper estimated that there was enough
dough to provide bread for half a year the prob-
lem now was not how to get them into the city but
how to get them out and keep them out in spite
of premier plautz reassurance in the afternoon


amazing stories

paper and definite orders for the army to advance
on the next day the entire populace was beginning
to be worried

  their chief anxiety arose because of the fact that
they could not understand or comprehend the
situation

then just towards evening the yeast men
began to die not all at once but in increasing
numbers and twilight advanced to add darkness
to the horror then they died by thousands and
hundreds of thousands all over eupenia it was
bad enough in the country districts where here and
there the pools of end-slime dotted the woods and
the meadows but in the cities especially in the
capital the immediate result was a panic in hut
and palace home and barracks life was no longer
possible  account of these thousands of puddles
of nausea-producing slime the houses were filled
with it the streets were filled with it the only
living things that were unaffected were the yeast
men waiting for their turn to die with sightless
faces they shuffled along the streets passing uncon-
cerned through the decayed bodies of their brothers
with apparently only one idea-to keep moving till
death came to enable them to add their bit to the
defence of their country

  the people fled sick and sweating pale-faced
and gasping incapacitated and vomiting they ran
from the terror the army fled cursing the premier
for thinking to feed them on such putrid offal noth-
ing could hold them or restore discipline and
around moronia was a widening desolate deserted
ring in which there was no living thing

  the people fled to the border the neighboring
kingdoms however friendly as they were to eu-
penia thought of their own safety in this strange
vomiting in the tales of delirium told by the first
refugees they thought they saw symptoms of a new
and deadly contagious disease and at once threw a
line of bayonets along their borders and forbade
emigration from the stricken land

  eupenia deserted her capital without shedding a
drop of blood

  premier plautz as soon as he had sufficiently
recovered from his own personal vomiting to con-
sider the matter called a meeting of his staff and
ordered the advance to begin against the enemy
this he said was only a new method of conducting
war were they to be conquered by smells or inert
lumps of yeast let the artillery blow them to
pieces let the cavalry cut them to pieces the
infantry could build fires and burn them a faith-
ful remnant of the once proud army attempted to
follow out his orders but no soldier however brave
can continually fight on an empty stomach and no
officer however capable can give orders while con-
stantly vomiting the arqiy from the general-in-
chief down to the privates were continually sick
with the sickness of jonahs whale

  the whole resistance was hopeless the yeast
men arrived day after day in increasing numbers
and they could not be killed they could be muti-
lated dissevered decapitated but each piece lived
and moved onwards

  efforts at their destruction only added to the
horror and put the finishing touch to the destruction
of morale

  w hat use cutting a thing to pieces when each
piece kept on living and advancing how could
an enemy be killed when it could not bleed

  eupenia was hysterical

  on the sixth day the army revolted killed pre-
mier plautz and declared the kingdom a republic

  immediately they sued for peace by radio mo-
ronia suspected a trap and refused to grant an
armistice her guns continued the deadly shower
finally on the tenth day of the unequal struggle
peace was declared

  afterwards the world blamed moronia for not
granting an immediate armistice but it is only fair
to her to say that she did not know the full horror
of the war at the time and never did realize it as the
eupenians did she was anxious enough for peace
but she wanted a peace that would be permanent

  but eupenia not only wanted peace she wanted
help to rid her of the millions of tons of terrible
end-slime mr billings was called in for advice
he laughed at the question

  the smell only lasts for ten days he said and
then dies out and the slime simply becomes a highly
concentrated manure more rich than any commer-
cial fertilizer that we have yet discovered the
fields of eupenia will be the more fertile because
of this manure tell the farmers to be patient and
hopeful they will have fine crops next year the
city people can shovel it up for their window boxes
it will grow wonderful violets

  later on at the close of the peace festival mr
billings was decorated the little old king ru-
dolph hulelaire put his one arm around the in-
ventor and kissed him on both cheeks then he
pinned the decoration of the golden moronian eagle
on him while the people cheered

   i want to raise your salary said the king

  the only rays i am interested in replied the
inventor who had not been paying much attention
to what the king was saying are the light-and
energy-rays i have another idea about them which
i think i can work out if you will let me have some
money for my experimentation

  you can have all the money you want was the
kings eager answer but tell me one thing what
made those yeast men grow and move the way
they did

  it was like this your majesty they were just
yeast cells but they were filled with a special dynamic
energy a very special form of energy i could tell
you all about it but i am afraid that it would be
hard for you to follow my technical explanation

  i know i couldnt laughed the king iwish
you could put that kind of energy into my people
we could win the commerce of the world but i
suppose you can do things with yeast that you can-
not do with human beings now let us go to the
banquet the people are anxious to hear you

  and mr billings of the united states of america
said to rudolph hubelaire king of moronia

  i am not very good at speechifying

by harley saldingcr

mighty tree in that great primeval
jungle of the mesozoic age was pushed
aside as you or i might lightly push
aside a willow bush and the terrifying
head of cayna the tyrannosaurus king
of the jungle was thrust through

  his little red-rimmed cold reptilian eyes were
blazing with hate and menace for cayna was in
another of his blood-rampages that day and woe
betide the unlucky animals whom he encountered no
matter what heir size and strength might be it
was a blood lust of a fierceness and wantonness to
which only cayna could

attain	-

  as the battle - scarred
old warrior stepped out
from behind the tree he
presented a frightful and
menacing sight he tow-
ered fully forty feet high
with great jaws four feet
in length set in his mas-
sive head with fangs six    ---
or seven inches long and

supported by his mighty hind limbs which could
send him forward with great leaps and bounds at
need with the speed of an express train he had
a massive tail fully forty feet long gigantic at the
base and tapering gradually to a small tip a ter-
rible engine of destruction the tyrannosaurus in
fact is known as the most destructive living thing
that ever existed caynas comparatively small fore-
legs were armed with rending claws

 t is always interesting to imagine what our earth
 looked like millions of years ago before man had ap-
 peared the time when the giant animals of the mesozoic
 age were roaming over our planet how did they live
 and what did they do our new author has developed a
 charming tale based upon accurate scientific knoivlcdge
 a story that despite its shortness is highly interesting and
 gives us an excellent idea of the past and bloody age

   he strode through the giant trees with his body
bent forward at an angle of about forty-five degrees
with small eyes searching malevolently for some
opponent against whom to pit his mighty thews and
destroying armament his huge mouth was half
open and from time to time he emitted thunderous
roars and screams of defiance

  the other animals knew from these sounds that
the mighty king was abroad and thirsting for blood
so everywhere he found all game departed from
his path

  becoming more cunning but no less fierce or
  relentless in his blood-
  hunt cayna ceased his
  roaring and screaming
  and crept stealthily
  through the jungle soft-
  footed as a cat

   as lie did so he saw
   not a hundred feet away a
   giant pterodactyl a great

 winged reptile with bat-

------ like feather less wings

                            having four legs each ter-
 minating in four fingers one of which was fastened
 to the wings that is how they derived their name
 wing-fingered it had a short head and a beak
 filled with needle-sharp teeth he saw it swoop
 down and seize a small mammal about the size of
 a sheep and drawing the struggling animal into the
 air plunge its mighty beak into the base of the neck
 with a shrill cry the mammal grew limp in the
 pterodactyls wing-fingers

it had an abnormally long neck with a head at the end so small that it looked like a mere continuation of the neck    cayna charged
forth and leaping upon the mountainous back buried his great fangs in the thick rolls of flesh at the base of the neck

  burdened by the heavy load the reptile hew
heavily just clearing the treetops he had gone
about a hundred feet when a mighty head was up-
reared over the tree tops mighty jaws yawned cav-
ernously and the great bird-lizard and its prey were
crunched together in the grinding jaws of the flesh-
eater

  having finished his repast cayna set forth again
to see what new adventure the day would bring him
he did not have to look far

  out into a small clearing stepped an animal which
resembled a living gibraltar it traveled on all
fours but its hind limbs were four times as long as
the forelegs so that its nose almost touched the
ground it stood sixteen feet high at the thighs
was covered with hard bony plates except on the
underbody forming an impenetrable armor from
the base of the head over the back and halfway
down its tail was a succession of bony plates in
double columns and varying in height from a couple
of inches to three feet each razor-sharp at the edges
and coming to a sharp point at the top the head
was very small and triangular in shape with small
eyes and a mouth that cleft back past its eyes its
monstrous tail was its one means of offense or de-
fense enormous at the base fully ten feet in
diameter it tapered gradually for its whole length
of twenty-five feet and ended in a very blunt tip
where the bony finlike plates had ended in the
middle of the tail a series of four pairs of extremely
sharp conical spikes of about two feet in length
began when the stegosaurus lashed out with this
spiked tail it would produce the same result as if
you hit a person with a board through which a series
of nails had been driven

  this then was the monster upon which the flesh-
eating tyrannosaurus looked ordinarily in the
presence of other and more easily conquered game
he would have passed the stegosaurus by for the
plated lizard was regarded by the other dinosaurs
in the same way as the present animals regard a
porcupine but cayna was in no mood to pass any-
thing by with which he might do battle

  so with a mighty roar he charged the armored
dinosaur lashing out at the others head with one of
his smaller forelegs but the stegosaurus had antici-
pated the movement and had drawn its head inside
its armor like a mud-turtle and the blow only
scraped the impenetrable plates on its neck

  thus they jockeyed around for some moments
the tyrannosaurus always being careful to keep at
the others head end out of reach of the destroying
tail and the stegosaurus endeavoring to wheel and
strike a bone-crushing blow with his spiked
appendage

  but the old king had not survived many fierce
battles by sheer luck he resorted to strategy
striking a slow hesitating blow toward the others
concealed head he induced the sluggish giant to
strike at it this it did and when its head was fully
out the wily monarch lashed out carrying away the
right side and one eye of the plated dinosaurs
face

  screaming in amazement the great stegosaurus
reared up on its hind legs it was the opening for
which cayna had been waiting leaping forward
he sized the others neck with both forepaws
then supporting himself with his tail he swiftly
disemboweled the other with his immense hind legs

the great tail of the stegosaurus lashed convulsively
for a few seconds then was still and the flesh-eater
dined well

having satisfied his hunger but not his blood
lust cayna went forth again until he arrived
at a rather small plain nearby alongside a great
boulder was a huge bull triceratops snorting and
pawing the earth savagely he was evidently an
outcast from a vast herd which could e seen in the
distance stretching as far as eye could reach count-
less thousands

  the triceratops was about eleven feet tall at the
thigh where like the stegosaurus he was the tall-
est however his forelegs were not nearly so short
in comparison to the hind legs as were the stego-
saurus he was also like the stegosaurus covered
with hard bony plates or knobs which served him
as armor he also possessed a bony frill about his
neck which gave him the appearance of a roman
gladiator he had characteristic of a dinosaur
a great tail enormous at the base and tapering-
gradual ly three horns and a parrot-like beak com-
pletes his description one horn over the nose was
about a foot and a half in length and the other two
one over each eye four or five feet in length and
all three were of needle-like sharpness a monster
worthy of the gigantic caynas best efforts

  charging with a roar out into the open the
tyrannosaurus leaped upon the three-horns back
endeavoring to sink his giant fangs through the im-
penetrable armor but his efforts were unavailing

  the triceratops with an impatient shake of its
mighty frame hurled the tyrannosaurus from its
insecure hold up against the great boulder then
whirling rapidly it sank its shorter nose-horn its
full length into the tyrannosaurus

  the old monarch in desperation seized the other
two great horns of the triceratops in his smaller fore-
paws and forcing the great head down thus origi-
nated a hold which rendered the other helpless

  the triceratops bellowing insanely continued to
gore and slit the tyrannosaurus flesh to ribbons
with his nose horn and parrot-like beak but was
unable to inflict a fatal wound but in spite of his
terrible punishment the tyrannosaurus continued to
force the great head downward and finally it touched
the ground then screaming in triumph he sank
his great fangs into the now unprotected neck
crunching it until he severed the spinal column and
the horned giant fell dead at his feet

  but the old king had not escaped unscathed and
he was bleeding from a score of wounds so 
sooner was his adversary dead than he hurried
away to a little pool he knew of to lick and bathe
his wounds he was chastened in body but not in
spirit and his two previous battles had only caused
the flame of his blood lust to burn more brightly

  after perhaps an hour of bathing and licking his
wounds cayna ventured forth once more coming
finally to a pebbled beach by the great sea water

  he found a gigantic brontosaurus basking at full
length upon it of all the colossal dinosaurs there
were none so huge as the brontosaurus excepting
the diplodoeus a creature greatly resembling him

  a great monster about seventy-five feet long
standing sixteen feet at the thighwhere a char-
acteristic of a dinosaur it stood the tallest and
weighing nearly forty tons it had  system of
the way of a dinosaur



offense or defense except the great tail eight feet
in diameter at the base and trailing out behind for
sixty or seventy feet it had an abnormally long
neck with a head at the end so small that it looked
like a mere continuation of the neck

  this then was the creature upon which cayna
charged forth and leaping upon the mountainous
back buried his great fangs in the thick rolls of
flesh at the base of the neck and ground steadily
downward in a search for the spinal column

  the monster at the first attack had leaped
screaming shrilly into the air for all its great
weight it bit ineffectually at the tyrannosaurus
heavy hide with its small frail teeth and lashed at
it with its heavy tail the last however was not
entirely ineffectual the whip-like tip cut the tyran-
nosaurus back to ribbons but the great saurian was
unable to reach the other with the heavier part of
its tail or caynas story would now be over

  in desperation the monster finally charged out
into the sea where it was infinitely more agile than
on land

  charging out swiftly he reached deep water and
started to roll over on the tyrannosaurus but it
was never accomplished for at that moment caynas
six inch fangs ground home and the brontosaurus
rolled over on its back dead

  the hideously mangled but victorious king after
having assured himself that his adversary was dead
began to swim slowly toward the shore but he
never reached it

  for at that moment an ichthyosaurus a thirty-
foot saw-toothed jawed sea-dinosaur swopt up
from below and buried half its saw-like jaw into
the tyrannosaurus

  whipping frenziedly about the great saurian bit
the ichthyosaurus head entirely off in his rage but
at that moment an entire school of the bloodthirsty
fish-lizards swept up and the tyrannosaurus dis-
appeared in a boiling bloody inferno

  and thus cayna the king went the way of a
dinosaur meeting the fate of all the bloodthirsty
breed sooner or later

scientific adventures

by hugo gernshach

	munchhausen departs for the planet mars

xce upon a time a grouchy young
gentleman with a grievance for fiction
writers probably because they received
more emoluments for their stuff than he
did for bis poetry thus vented his re-
sentment in immortal song

   tis strange but true for truth is always strange
-stranger than fiction

  prom this some coarse soul totally oblivious of
any poetic infection took it upon himself to mutilate
the above passage of one of lord byrons poems
and taught us unsuspecting mortals to say parrot-
wise ever after until the end of fiction thusly
truth is stranger than fiction

  with all due regard to the memory and genius of
byron i  m alier a citizen of a free country take
it upon myself to correct his lordship at this late
and quarrelsome date to wit

  there is no fiction

  if as it has often-no always-been proved that
the most fantastic fiction at some time or other in-
variably comes true then by all processes of modern
logic there can be no such thing as fiction it simply
does not exist this brings us face to face with the
startling result that if fiction always comes true
some time or other why then bless their dear souls
all fiction writers must be prophets hurrah for
the f ws but hold on
boys dont let our enthu-
siasm run away with us

while it is nice to be a
prophet dont forget that
a prophet is never never
recognized in his own
country thus the new
testament teaches so i
think it will ik safer for
all f ws to remain
f ws rather than be-
come honorless prophets

  however that is not
what  had in mind when
i started-its so hard for
me to say what i mean and
a good deal harder for me to keep my thoughts run-
ning on the track they ramble from one nothing-
nes into another my mind in that respect is a
good deal like a one-eyed religious old cow on a
pasture she eats up whatever she sees alongside of
her but when she finally turns around she perceives
with astonishment that there is still a lot to graze
on the other side so she steers around to starboard
and returns to her original starting point

  but  am rambling again so lets return to the
place we started from

  seriously speaking and bv way of emphasizing

how much stranger truth is than fiction t have but
to point to jules vernes famous stories fifty-eight
years ago when he wrote twenty thousand
leagues under the sea no one took him seriously
it is doubtful whether he himself believed that the
submarine which he invented in that story would
ever become practical it was just fiction yet
forty-five years later a submarine almost exactly
like the one his vivid and prophetic mind conceived
emerges from a german harbor and travels under
its own power over a distance of xx miles through
the north sea the english channel down the at-
lantic through the entire length of the mediterranean
and up through the dardanelles to constantinople
and by way of diversion it manages to sink several
battleships of the enemy by means of its torpedoes
now bold as he was jules verne never conceived
such an impossible thing and while his famous
nautilus was equipped with almost every other
modern submarine necessity the infernal atitomobile-
torpedo was missing truth is indeed very much
stranger than fiction but i mustnt ramble

  munchhausen as will be remembered had ex-
plained the mysteries of the moon to me and he had
also mentioned the great danger of falling meteorites
which had been increasing alarmingly in number for
some time the moons attenuated atmosphere offers
no protection from mete-
ors as does the earth
thick air but few mete-
ors ever reach the surface
of the earth the intense
friction between the me-
teor and the air ignites the
former and most of it
falls as a fine dust the
burning of the meteors
represents t h e shooting
stars we see on the moon
however the meteors crash
down bodily causing tre-
mendous havoc and this
terrible bombardment goes
on forever without let-up
consequently when baron miinchhauscn stopped
short that evening in the midst of a sentence i natur-
ally was alarmed not a little great was my joy
therefore when sitting before my radio set thonext
evening phone clapped tight over my ears my eyes
glued on the clock the familiar high whining spark
suddenly reverberated in my ears at the stroke of 
oclock

  it was munchhausen but his usual sonorous
voice to-night had an unfamiliar metallic timbre
that puzzled me greatly in a short time however
the mystery was cleared 

 ohakespeare the master of the drama never con-
 ceivcd anything like a drama of an entire world-mil-
 lions of intelligent beings - fighting a heroic battle -a
 battle for existence yet this drama was going on right
 before his very eyes but  million miles auray for the
 martians have been fighting for water ages ago and the
 available suly becomes smaller each year tltcrc is
 nothing more inspiring nothing more gripping for the
 imagination than this wonderful battle between organized
 intelligence on one side ad unrelenting nature on the other
 baron mnchhauscns scientific lecture gives you the
 latest facts - mow almost universally believed - about
 mars you can spend no better half hour than turning
 your mind from your humdrum existence towards a sub-
 ject which is as absorbing as this


          three circular massive structures which looked like metal aircraft spaced equal distances apart were floating in space the three
          flyers marked an equilateral triangle while in the exact center but about one mile lower down than the flyers our interstellar was float-
          ing three shafts of an intense yellow ray were turned on us and it was this light or rather the peculiar properties of the rays which

had made us captives to the martians superior intelligence




amazing stories

  my dear alier no doubt you thought i had
been killed by a meteor last night well as you
americans put it  certainly had a close shave a
meteor crashed down on my aerial  feet from
where  was sitting of course it went up in smoke-
metallic vapor to be correct-due to the tremendous
heat generated by the impact of the meteor on the
granite rocks the meteor went up in a fiery cloud
of red vapor and i was blown headlong a distance
of over  feet right down into the mouth of a giant
crater by the resulting blast of the concussion

  this long-extinct crater is a very deep one how
deep i was soon to learn i went down head first
and kept on falling down that abyss at a terrific
rate of speed for what seemed to be hours as i
kept on plunging down i was gloomily reflecting
what an inglorious end it was to die at the bottom of
an unromantic crater on a dead and dried-up moon
i thought of many things when i suddenly became
conscious of a frightful cold call it instinct or pres-
ence of mind or what you will but as soon as i
had started on my downward journey i had jerked
my body in such a manner as to righten it in other
words after a few attempts i succeeded in falling
feet down it was indeed a fortunate circumstance
that the sun was almost directly over the crater for
it saved me the anguish of plunging into a pitch-
black abyss while it was not nearly as light as it was
at the top still i could see where i was falling and
that was some consolation thus when i glanced
down toward mv feet after a while i am sure that
my heart which had lost some beats stood still en-
tirely it took me a few seconds to collect my be-
wildered senses for this is what i saw

  the crater had no bottom at all it went right
through to the center of the moon where it con-
nected with another crater which went to the op-
posite side i knew this must be so because when i
looked down i saw several stars shining through
brilliantly from the night side of the moon then
the awful truth flashed through me and i almost
swooned i was falling through the whole diameter
of the moon i had been in many tight quarters be-
fore during my somewhat exciting career but this
experience indeed bade well to be the inglorious end
of my adventurous life however my far-famed
presence of mind and my cool head soon asserted
themselves as was naturally to be expected of me

  i knew the diameter of the moon to be 
miles a quick mental calculation proved that it
would take my falling body about  minutes to
reach the center of the moon as there was nothing
to stop my fall i must naturally continue to fall due
to the tremendous momentum acquired till my body
would have fallen for  minutes if i could not
manage then to grasp a projecting rock i would
commence to fall back again toward the center of the
moon i reasoned that once more my momentum
would carry me past the center and i would then be
almost carried to the mouth of the opposite crater-
my original starting point

  i say almost for the friction of my body against
the air would tend to retard my fall if at this point
where my speed was again zero i could not succeed
in taking hold of a projecting rock of the craters
side i would begin to fall down once more the same
as before i would then continue falling back and
forward exactly like a bouncing ball each time how-
ever-just like a rubber ball-a little less than on the
previous plunge thus my drops would become of

shorter duration and finally i would fall no more

  as i had mentioned betore the sun was almost
overhead shining down into the crater  also re-
membered that it was almost exactly  oclock mid-
night terrestrial time when the meteor smashed my
aerial this then was the time i started on my re-
markable journey into the bowels of the moon with
a tremendous effort i pulled out my chronometer and
noted that it was  a m in another minute i
would fly past the center of the moon looking
about i saw in the uncertain light that i went whizz-
ing through an immense hollow proving to me that
the center of the moon was far from solid due no
doubt to the centrifugal force of the moon at the
time when it had not solidified some millions of
years ago i estimated later that the moon was an
immense hollow sphere with a solid crust about 
miles thick by way of a homely comparison the
moon therefore must be a hollow globe like a rubber
ball and like the latter it is filled inside with air
while its crust can be compared to the rubber of the
ball

  in another minute i had passed the center and
was now dropping toward the other side of the moon
if  continued falling in my present position i must
naturally emerge at the opposite side with my feet
toward the sky as a little reflection will reveal to you
so once more i jerked my body about and i was
falling-up with my head at the top my feet point-
ing to the sun at the end of another  minutes i
could feel my body slowing up from the terrific
speed as the crater at this side of the moon was
fortunately rather narrow i found little difficulty
in reaching for a projecting rock as soon as my
plunge had come to a dead stop i held on for dear
life and clambered up a narrow ledge where i fell
down exhausted and panting from my dreadful ex-
perience

ftou would of course like to know my sensa-
i tions in falling through  miles of space
going over  miles per second at the center of the
moon well the first minute it is rather unpleasant
highly so the place where your stomach should be
by right is one vast area of nausea but once you
become accustomed to it it becomes bearable for
there is nothing else to do you might think that the
rush of air would kill you in a few seconds or else
draw all the air out of your lungs and thus asphyxi-
ate you but neither is the case for the air is so
thin on the moon that the rush is not as terrific as
it would be on earth also by keeping the mouth
tightly shut and breathing-with difficulty it is true
-through the nose one does not die in  minutes
the friction of the air against my body did not ignite
either for as i told you some time ago the tempera-
ture inside the moon is near the absolute zero the
awful cold of the stellar world but neither did i
freeze to death for the simple reason that the fric-
tion of my body through the attenuated air was just
sufficient to keep me comfortably warm thns you
see that if it had not been so cold i would have
burned up and if the friction of the air against
my body had not heated it i would have frozen to
death long before i reached the center of the moon
then too another important point to consider is
that on the moon as i explained before my body
weighed  pounds against  pounds on earth
this is of course a rather small weight and for that
reason my fall was not as terrible as it would have
baron munchhausfn



been if my body had weighed  pounds as it did
on earth for that reason too  was not attracted
so much to the sides of the crater as  would have
been otherwise also it was fortunate that the two
craters widened out considerably the further down
they went into the moons interior as a matter of
fact the hole of each crater at no point was less
than three miles in diameter this was indeed very
lucky for me for the following reason

  if we drop a stone into a very deep and narrow
shaft this stone will never reach the bottom as has
been shown experimentally on earth instead it will
bury itself in the eastern wall of the shaft long be-
fore it gets near the bottom providing the shaft is
deep enough the explanation is that the earth
rotates on its axis from west to east at a speed of
 feet per second at the equator thus it is
apparent that the earth revolves more quickly than
the stone can fall in a few seconds it therefore
intercepts the stones flight with the result that the
stone must of necessity strike the eastern wall of the
shaft this phenomenon is termed the falling of
a body toward east

  now precisely the same condition exists on the
moon of course fortunately  started falling at
the western side of the crater but as the latter was
so wide i never came near enough to its eastern wall
to hit it likewise the other crater at the opposite
side of the moon measured some four miles in dia-
meter and while i finally did reach the eastern wall
my flight had come to an end as explained already
indeed nature favored me all through for the moon
rotates with a velocity of but  - feet per second
at its equator against a tangential speed of 
feet of the earth for this reason there was no
danger that my body would collide with the sides
of the crater somewhere in the interior of the moon

  but in the meanwhile my troubles were far from
being terminated no sooner had i regained my
breath than i became conscious of the terrible cold
for i was now but a few feet from the surface of the
moon on that side which was turned away from the
sun where only icy cold darkness and desolation
reign aside from this i was some  miles
away from flitternix my companion and our inter-
stellar walking around half of the moon was out
of the question neither could i stay where i was
without freezing to death so i climbed up to the
surface of the moon with considerable effort then
by the aid of the starlight i ran rapidly around to
the western side of the crater for i had to run in
order to keep warm after having obtained my
bearings by the aid of the stellar constellations to
make sure that i was at the western side of the
crater i took a deep breath looked down in the
abyss through which the sun was shining from the
other side and dived head down into space once
more

  you see i had reasoned that it was far better
to attempt the flying journey through the moon once
more than to perish with the cold on the dark side of
the moon besides i had experience now and hav-
ing been successful once it was natural that i should
expect success again i had nothing whatever to
lose and everything to gain

  my first experience was repeated without any

   the speed of a falling body at the surface of the earth
after the first second is   feet in six seconds a stone
would have traveled but  feet

incident furthermore i calculated that i should land
at the eastern wall of the far crater within  min-
utes if everything ran smoothly but i had left
our good old sun out of my calculations you see
the gravitational attraction of the sun controlled the
fall of my body in the same proportion as it controls
the rotation of the moon of the earth and of other
planets i mentioned how in my former flight i
had risen to the top of the moon as a matter of fact
somewhat higher for the opening of this crater was
higher than the surface of the moon but now i
was falling toward the sun and the sun was aiding
and accelerating my flight for i moved constantly
nearer to it

  for this reason at the end of  minutes i did
not strike the eastern end of the crater instead i
whizzed right past the eastern wall almost brushing
it and continued to rise up into the air about 
feet before my speed was spent i promptly pre-
pared myself to plunge down into the crater again
indeed before i realized it i had begun to fall down
once more when the unexpected happened

  i suddenly felt a rope encircling my body and
before  had time to think i was jerked sideways
in another second i had fallen on a heap of sand
and was looking with astonishment into professor
flit ter nixs eyes

ttpl-iis is what had happened flitternix had
j of course seen me fall into the crater and as
he had rushed to the edge he had seen how i dropped
down with lightning speed looking closer he also
noticed what i saw namely that the crater went right
through the entire mass of the moon for he could
see the stars shining through from the other end he
was loath to believe that the fall would kill me and
as a scientist of note he calculated exactly in ad-
vance what was likely to happen to me he re-
flected that it would take me some two hours to make
the round trip as he knew that i could not possibly
stay at the other side of the moon he reasoned
correctly that in case i was not killed i would come
swinging through the crater in due time unper-
turbed as he is by such mere details he went to the
interstellar and had his lunch within two hours
he returned to the crater armed with a telescope
and a long rope it did not take him long to locate
me down in the abyss by means of his glass for i
was rapidly coming to the surface then attaching
one end of the rope to a near-by rock he fashioned
a sliding noose on the other side and waited

  now it must be said to the credit of flitternix
that in his younger days he had lived in the west on
a ranch and there had become an expert in the
science of lassoing lie boasted that once he las-
soed a common sparrow by its left hind leg but this
i believe to be somewhat exaggerated be that as
it may when i finally emerged to the surface a
living piece of lava ejected out of an extinct crater
flitternix had little trouble in lassoing me as i came
whizzing up

  i thanked him and asked him if lunch was ready
for the trip had given me quite an appetite as you
may well imagine luncheon over we decided right
then and there to quit the moon for flitternix as
well as myself were of the opinion that there was
little further to be explored on this dead world
besides the meteors had become so alarmingly fre-
quent that it would be only a matter of time when
one or both of us would be killed


amazing stories

  flittcrnix wanted to return to earth at once tor
he itched to give a lecture before the american as-
tronomical society whose honorary president he was
i however had more ambitious plans i once had
looked through the great telescope of the lowell
observatory at flagstaff arizona if i live to be
a thousand years old  will never forget the glorious
sight which then presented itself to my eyes

  i saw a ball lighted up dazzlingly at both ex-
tremities i saw great patches of an ochre red scat-
tered over the surface of the sphere and i had seen
dark blue areas among the vast ochre patches over
the latter runs a mass of fine lines nearly all of
them connecting with the white caps at each ex-
tremity moreover these fine lines cause one to gasp
involuntarily for they are as straight and true as if
laid out with a rule and pencil more astonishing
yet some of these lines run absolutely parallel with
other ones for the whole extent of their length
and more wonderful still whenever two or more
lines meet in a junction there is invariably a round
black spot

  the ball which held me transfixed for a long time
was mars the nearest planet to earth then -

	miles distant from your sphere the late prof
percival lowell the great authority on martian re-
search work had convinced the scientific world that
the dazzling white caps at the poles of this planet
are the polar snow fields the great ochre patches
arc desert land while the dark blue areas represent
large tracts of fertile land and its resulting vegeta-
tion

  now according to well-known physical laws
proved beyond discussion the smaller a body the
quicker it will cool off all planets and their moons
once were white-hot like our sun the smaller ones
cooled off first and the larger ones are not cold yet
thus the earth which measures  miles in dia-
meter is still red-hot in its interior as is proved by
its active volcanoes the moon which is but 
miles through cooled off ages ago the oceans once
filling their beds then filtered down into its bowels
there to freeze solid for there was no heat to keep
the water fluid its atmosphere which was formerly
as dense as that of our earth was gradually thrown
off into space till to-day practically no atmosphere
remains thus the moon rolls on through space a
dead world

  the planet mars measuring  miles in diam-
eter as will be seen is only twice the diameter of
our moon and much smaller than the earth con-
sequently it must be rapidly nearing its extinction
just as the moon has done its oceans are already
dry and most of its land is desert practically all
the atmosphere has gone too which is proved by the
fact that we seldom observe clouds on mars through
the telescope rut there must still be water on the
planet this is irrefutably proved by its polar snow
caps this view is further strengthened by the fact
that these caps undergo seasonal changes as the
sun beats down upon them we see first the one then
the other grow smaller in size till at the end of the
martian midsummer the northern one has disap-
peared almost entirely during the next hot season
the same happens to the southern one where has
this water-the only remaining water on mars-
gone it cannot have filtered into the interior for
if it had we could not possibly witness the reap-
pearance of the polar snow fields every martian year
as we actually do where then does the water go

f  rv r lowell solved the problem in a bril-

  jl liant as well as ingenious manner

  his view-and it is shared by most of our scien-
tists to-day-was that mars is inhabited by a think-
ing people fighting an heroic battle for their exist-
ence without water life as we know it cannot
exist now ages ago the shortage of water had
made itself felt on mars long before the first cave-
man appeared on earth mars had been an old world
where civilized peoples had reigned for centuries
while our ancestors were still jumping from limb to
limb among the trees in primordial forests and
jungles the water problem on mars had become
acute the fertile lands were fast turning into
deserts for rains had become more and more infre-
quent until they had stopped almost entirely fur-
thermore as mars is flat practically without moun-
tains of any sort there could not be any natural
rivers to convey the water to the plains and valleys
as is the case on our world the martians seeing
utter extermination staring them in the face pro-
ceeded to save their race they did precisely the
same thing that we are doing in western america
and the egyptians and english are doing in egypt
namely effecting the irrigation of deserts or semi-
deserts on a large scale our recent roosevelt dam
in arizona offera a good example of this our en-
gineers on earth have to bring the water to the
deserts precisely as the martian engineers must have
been doing for centuries past

  on earth however this is a comparatively simple
matter for here we have rivers and lakes in abun-
dance which can be tapped with ease not so on
mars the only remaining water there is found
around the poles by sheer necessity therefore the
martians had to go to the poles for their water
supply and this is exactly what our telescopes reveal
that they did for the long unswerving straight
lines which we see are part of the canals bringing
the water down from the poles to the desert land
there to irrigate it so far the lowell observatory
has discovered almost  canals but there are
doubtless many more they criss-cross the entire
surface of the planet in every conceivable direction
most of them however run due north and south in
the direction of the poles not only do the canals
cross the desert lands but we see them carried bodily
across the dark blue areas which we know to be ir-
rigated vegetation tracts the fact that the canals
run across these areas is another proof that these
areas are not oceans as had been thought at one
time

  now the lines which we see running over the
planet are really not the canals themselves but are
simply wide strips of vegetation fertilized and kept
alive by the water from the canals the average
width of the canals proper dr lowell estimated to
be about six miles there are some of them how-
ever which are thought to be much wider than this
the length of these canals however is stupendous
there are some canals which actually measure 
miles in length a great many are over  miles
long dozens of them run for  miles and
nearly all of the canals run in absolutely straight
lines

  the circular black areas mentioned above which
we see almost invariably at the juncture of one or
more canals are termed oases they also represent
vast tracts of vegetation and probably contain large
cities farms and so forth
baron munchhausen



  viewing mars and its canals through a first class
telescope must convince the strongest opponent of
dr lowells theory that these wonderfully straight
lines cannot by any possible chance be the work of
nature the counterpart is found nowhere on earth
nor in the heavens and if for arguments sake we
consider these lines to be of natural origin it is in-
conceivable that so many of them could join and
meet as they do and form these exact circular areas
their artificial origin is too apparent and cannot be
otherwise considered to-day dr lowells theory
has so far withstood the onslaughts of nearly all op-
ponents as a matter of fact his explanation is to-
day accepted almost universally

  but how do the martians move the tremendous
masses of water through their canals mars is en-
tirely level and water does not flow on a level sur-
face without a head moreover during one season
it must needs flow from the north towards the equa-
tor when the northern polar snow cap melts under
the influence of the suns heat during the next sea-
son however this flow must be reversed for now the
south polar snow cap melts with a resulting flow of
the water from the south to the north

  but how do the martians succeed in moving the
water we dont know even professor lowell
could tell us nothing on this point terrestrial
science simply has as yet not advanced enough to
offer an explanation

  well to make a long story short flitternix and
i decided to voyage to planet mars my little as-
tronomical lecture was given solely for the purpose
of refreshing your mind about mars in order that
future reports which i shall make to you from the
planet may be better understood by you and your
friends

  as long as our interstellar was able to succeed
in reaching the moon without mishap i felt sure that
the trip to mars would not be an unduly difficult un-
dertaking flitternix was of the same opinion we
calculated that the intervening  million miles sepa-
rating the moon from mars should be negotiated by
our space flyer in thirty days barring accidents
while this may seem like a short time in which to
cover such an immense distance our speed of -

	miles a day or  miles an hour is only
a trifle greater than the speed of the earth 
miles an hour as it travels in its orbit around the
sun

  we immediately made our preparations and
within six hours after i had emerged from the
crater the interstellar had left the moon

  and now for a little surprise no doubt you
noted that my voice does not sound the same as
usual you will have observed furthermore that
i did not stop talking since i started to break the
news gently to you j am not talking at all while
yon are listening to my voice at this minute i am
some  miles distant from the moon head-
ing towards mars

  the explanation simple as usual

  before leaving in our interstellar we stretched
an immense aerial inside of the canyon the one of
which i spoke to you several days ago as you will
remember t told you then that it was open but a
few feet across its opening at the top it thus
formed a long narrow slit at the top into which
there was little likelihood of any meteor dropping
which could destroy the aerial wre stretched four
wires in all along the inside of the canyon spacing

the strands six feet apart each strand is  feet
long which gives the required long wave length in
transmitting as well as receiving impulses between
mars and the moon as well as between the moon
and the earth

   to this aerial i connected my latest invention my
inter-planetarian kadiotornatic it is nothing but
an ingenious adaptation of modern tele-mechanics
and works as follows

when the aerial receives a certain number
vv of equally spaced dashes an ultra-sensitive
vacuum tube detector is actuated which in turn oper-
ates a gas-valve relay this relay then oloses its
contacts which sets in motion the well-known tele-
graphone invented by valdemar poulsen the danish
edison a second ultra-sensitive detector also con-
nected to the aerial is in series with the registering
electro-magnets of the telegraphone in front of these
magnets runs the moving steel wire on which are
then recorded the impulses coming in over the aerial
you will observe that no message can thus be re-
corded unless the original key dashes unlock the
telegraphone mechanism at the end of the mes-
sage the same number of equally spaced dashes will
lock the telegraphone mechanism the recorded
message is now ready for re-transmission at any
time desired this also is accomplished in a simple
manner

  i took our -day clock and fastened upon it a
contact which would be closed at exactly  p m
every night and would be opened again at  oclock
midnight this contact closes a circuit in which is
included the telegraphone mechanism as soon as it
starts the steel wire with its recorded message be-
gins to reel off in front of the two reproducing elec-
tromagnets which in turn are connected with a
special telephone receiver thus the telephone re-
ceiver will begin to talk its message if one was sent
during the day every evening at  oclock

  but connected to the telephone receiver are
several amplifiers arranged in cascade the last
amplifier is attached to the mouthpiece of the trans-
mitter of my wireless telephone thus the weakest
recorded talk on the telegraphone wire will cause
the telephone of the last amplifier to talk into the
wireless transmitter louder than myself

  now my -day clock every night at  oclock
also closes the contacts of a powerful relay which in
turn operates the generating plant of my wireless
telephone disconnecting it at midnight therefore
when the amplifier with its telephone begins to talk
into the transmitter of the wireless telephone there
will always be enough power to transmit it to you
on earth

  as soon as we arrive on mars we will in ail
probability find all the necessary materials to erect
a giant radio telephone plant and if we succeed we
will send daily messages to the moon and my radio-
tomatic relaying plant will transmit the messages to
you every night i might also mention that my ultra-
sensitive detector contains two radio-active sub-
stances making the detector such a marvelously
sensitive instrument that it will work a set of ampli-
fiers in cascade when an electric pocket buzzer is
operated one hundred and fifty miles away from it
connected to the ground only and using no aerial

  you might say why use the relaying plant on
the moon at all why not transmit from mars to
the earth directly


amazing stories

  the reason is that when the weak impulses arrive
from mars after having traveled from  to 
million miles they cannot be sufficiently strong to
pass through the earths thick atmosphere which is
always charged with electricity and static it is far
better that the weak impulses should operate the
relaying plant first and send out from it very strong
impulses which have to travel only some 
miles to earth

  we tested the plant thoroughly and after we
had satisfied ourselves that it would work for at
least  days i opened the telegraphone circuit
and began to register this message to you it will
be the last one which you will receive for  days or
more as it must take us from five to ten days to
build a transmitting plant on mars you need not
expect to hear from us for from  to  days
you might therefore commence to listen in be-
ginning with the th day from to-night no mes-
sage can ever be repeated for the wiping electro-

magnets of the telegraphone wipe out the magnetic
impulses from the steel wire as quickly as they pass
the transmitting magnets neither can you trans-
mit a message to me for no provisions were made
to relay your messages to us while on mars

i will now bid you adieu my boy think of us
during the next  days good-bye-good-bye - 
there was a silence for some seconds and as i
was still listening awestruck i was suddenly startled
by another voice

  hallo there alier this is professor flitternix
hows yankton beastly old town was once
forced to sleep on a billiard table in the palace hotel
as all the rooms were full the robbers charged me
 for the room plus the regulation rate of 
cents an hour for the use of the billiard table
mean town that yankton well good-bye   
there was a snapping noise and the rhythmic
low sizzling sound stopped abruptly all was quiet
once more

	munchhausen lands on mars

for forty-one days i had been listening in
nightly at my wireless set since that eventful
evening when baron munchhausen had left
the moon for the planet mars he had said that it
would take from  to  days before the inter-
stellar could negotiate the trip from the moon to
mars but nevertheless i became more and more im-
patient as the days wore on

  at last on the evening of the forty-second day
at  oclock on the second the peculiar unmistak-
able high whining spark suddenly broke upon my
ears after the long nervous strain the loud whis-
tling spark almost took me off my feet and i could
hardly hear the first words for excitement in a few
seconds the whistling sound died down and munch-
hausens dear sepulchral voice sounded once more in
my faithful receivers and how loud it was it
was positively uncanny to think that i was listening
to his canned voice which perhaps  or  hours
before had been hurled through the ether from mars
 millions miles to the moon there to be regis-
tered phonographically on a telegraphone wire and
now the barons voice through the radio telephone
sending plant on the moon  miles away from
me was talking the thought made me shiver

  hello alier it came in a sympathetic voice
how is old mother earth and yourself too bad
there is no return circuit for i would love to hear
your dear voice its over  days since i last heard
it but it cant be helped you must be satisfied to
listen to me without being able to talk back but
ill try to be as explicit as possible so that you will
not feel the need of asking questions

  well my boy the trip from the moon to mars
was entirely uneventful as soon as we had our
bearings we made straight for the red planet the
mysterious flitternix and i took watches alter-
nately and as we had learned from our former ex-
perience how to handle the interstellar the trip
became more or less monotonous we had a little
trouble at the start with the switching of the mar-
conium netting for it proved rather a puzzle to
perience how to handle the interstellar the trip
attractions of the sun the earth and the moon and
at the same time have the planet mars alone puli

us this bothered us considerably for several days
and we made little headway during that period
finally when the moon earth and sun in the order
named were in a straight line with mars almost
overhead our speed rapidly increased and on the
evening of the fourth day the interstellar was en-
tirely gravity-insulated from the moon earth and
sun we were then falling towards mars at the
rate of  miles an hour within  days our
speed had increased to over  miles an hour
and the earth which from the moon appeared 
times as large as the moon appears to you had
shrunk and shrunk till it looked like a small bright
red disc mars in the meanwhile became rapidly
larger and redder and soon it appeared like an ochre
disc at the end of the thirty-fifth day when our
speed had increased to  miles an hour due to
the proximity of the planet the earth had become
a bright star in the firmament somewhat brighter
than the other stars but a pitiful sight compared
to what it had appeared when we saw it from the
moon remember the moon is only  miles
distant from the earth while we were now over
 miles away quite a little difference

  the next day the thirty-sixth since our start we
were  miles distant from mars and the planet
at this distance was indeed the most gorgeous sight
either flitternix or i had ever witnessed mars
looked now almost as big to us as the earth looked
when viewed from the moon if the earth was
then a wonderful spectacle the planet mars when
seen from such a small distance is simply over-
whelming in its splendor we saw a full red disc
dazzlingly illuminated by the distant suns rays
like the earth mars has a pink fringe running
around the edge-its atmosphere the continents
stand forth in an ochre red intermingled with dark
green patches faint lines run over the entire face
of the planet like cobwebs-the famous martian
canals at the top a brilliant white cap is observed
-the north polar ice fields

  but the most wonderful sight to us was mars
two little moons flitternix calls them toy moons
we had the best view of these moons the next day
when we were some  miles distant from mars
baron munchhausen



  the planet mars has two tiny moons christened
phobos and deimos by terrestrial astronomers they
were discovered in  by professor asaph liall
of the washington observatory and they were so
minute in size that only the most powerful telescopes
on earth reveal them the largest phobos is about
 miles in diameter while the smaller deimos is
only  miles in diameter the latter is such a
ridiculously small world that a pedestrian could
walk around its equator in a single day an auto-
mobile given a fair road could circle this entire
world in one hour without exceeding the speed
limit

f f d hobos the larger moon is less than 

  	miles from the surface of mars and revolves
around the latter in the remarkably short time of
 hours and  minutes consequently the martians
witness the spectacle of their largest moon going
through all its phases in  hours in a single
martian morning therefore phobos can be seen to
rapidly change from new moon to first quarter then
full moon then last quarter and finally again new
moon and all this in  hours a unique feature
about phobos too is that it revolves more quickly
around mars than mars revolves upon its own axis
mars turns around its axis in  hours  minutes
and  seconds thus the martian day is almost
 minutes longer than the terrestrial day during
one martian day therefore phobos has spun more
than three times around mars as seen from mars
phobos appears about as large as the moon appears
to the inhabitants of the earth deimos the smaller
moon is  miles distant from mars whereas
its larger brother takes but iz hours to revolve
around mars deimos requires  hours to complete
its circuit or almost six days however deimos is
so far removed from mars and it is such a tiny
object that to the martians it really does not appear
as a moon at all-at least not as we umlerstand that
term for it must be apparent that if we view an
object measuring  miles across from a distance of
 miles we can hardly expect to see much for
that reason deimos when full appears only slightly
larger than the planet venus appears to you as seen
from the earth therefore the martian nights arc
not brilliantly illuminated by two large moons as
some writers would have you believe on the con-
trary the martian night is very much like the ter-
restrial night except that phobos when full appears
to shed more light on mars than the moon sheds
on earth for the martian atmosphere is consider-
ably thinner than the terrestrial one and for that
reason it does not absorb so much light

  after circling around mars at a height of 
miles for some time we finally decided to make a
landing by careful maneuvering and switching of
our anti-gravitational marconium netting we finally
descended to a height of but five miles from the
surface of mars on account of the etherless zone
of the marconium netting when switched on we
could not of course sec what was beneath us at
all times for light does not pass through etherless
space we had therefore only momentary glimpses
of the planet during the few seconds when the net-
ting was switched oft this constant switching on
and off of the current reduced our speed to almost
nothing we were thus slowly approaching an open
plain which we had picked out and which appeared
like part of a desert this was probably sandy enough

to eltect a soft landing of the interstellar from
our momentary glimpses we had become more than
convinced that the planet must indeed be inhabited
by intelligent creatures we had snatched a good
view of a wonderfully built city had seen sections
of the mysterious long waterways and their attend-
ing strips of vegetation otherwise known as the
martian canals and had also observed ponderous
aircraft by the thousand and curious structures near
the canals that looked like gigantic pyramids

  had we still doubted that mars was inhabited
we were taught differently in a few minutes for
things began to happen rapidly

  when we were still about two miles from the
planets surface suddenly as if by magic everything
before our eyes became yellow at the same time
a peculiar numb sensation came over our bodies and
we were hardly able to move hand or foot simul-
taneously the machinery of the interstellar became
unmanageable and looking through the lower port-
holes we could see that we were rapidly coming
closer to the planets surface at the same time mov-
ing in a totally different direction from the one to
which we were heading originally

  with some difficulty we managed to look up
towards the top port windows and we saw a marvel-
ous sight three circular massive structures which
looked like metal aircraft spaced equal distances
apart were floating in space the three flyers marked
an equilateral triangle while in the exact center but
about one mile lower down than the flyers our inter-
stellar was floating three shafts of an intense
yellow ray were turned on us and it was this light
or rather the peculiar properties of the rays which
had made us captives to the martians superior
intelligence

  we reasoned that these floating forts must be
used for defensive purposes on mars and we agreed
among us tliat the best thing we could possibly do
wa to submit ourselves entirely to the martians
will indeed we were so helpless that wc could not
have offered any resistance even had we wanted to
do so therefore we calmly awaited developments
for we reasoned instinctively that we would not be
harmed nor were we mistaken in this view

  the yellow rays guided the interstellar over a
vast distance and at the end of an hour we were
gently deposited on a huge grassplot in a fairyland
city the instant that our flyers broad landing
belt touched the ground the yellow rays disappeared
and immediately our normal facilities were restored
once more we were free to move and to act

  we lost no time in unbolting our steel door and
in our anxiety to get out in the open all three of
us flitternix myself and buster our airedale ter-
rier almost tumbled over each other i admit that
on a historical occasion like this the first time a
human being set foot on another planet we should
have appeared more dignified as for instance chris-
topher columbus did when he first landed on san
sakador sad to relate however there was noth-
ing dignified or solemn on the occasion of our land-
ing and this was partly due to buster that in-
fernal dog insisted on running between our feet and
succeeded in tripping flitternix just as he placed
his foot on the ground if it had not been for me he
would have sprawled all over the grass

  it is a good thing that the martians have a keen
sense of humor for the crowd that had collected
around our flyer began to laugh uproariously in a


amazing stories

queer characteristic martian falsetto tone  admit
that we offered a sufficient cause for amusement
the professor in his old prince albert and myself
attired in my costume of  however we quickly
managed to pull ourselves together and we blinked
around us in unconcealed amazement

  although the martian air is very much thinner
than the earths atmosphere we experienced but
little trouble in breathing for our stay in the rarefied
air of the moon had taught us how to breathe in
thin air we noticed immediately that the air was
very pure and we did not cough once as was the
case of our landing on the moon the martian air
seemed rich with ozone and we could not rid our-
selves of the idea at first that we were breathing the
strong air of a pine forest

  but the martians themselves held us spellbound
for some minutes  am not sure whether they were
not as much astonished as we were for as we found
out later the martian can conceal his emotions far
better than the proverbial indian while i was still
staring open-mouthed at the nearest martian flitter-
nix who had recovered first from his surprise
nudged me and said didnt i tell you

nly then did i remember our discourse of
v the previous day when we were speculating
together as to the probable appearance of the inhabi-
tants of mars i remember now that flitternix had
said something like this

  we have seen on earth that animal life is pos-
sible under the most adverse conditions we find
life at the north pole in the most awful cold and
we find life at the equator in the most intense
heat we find life in the thinnest mountain air and
we find life at the bottom of the ocean the latter
is particularly interesting because even up to a few
years ago scientists of note denied that a fairly
large creature such as a fish could withstand the
enormous pressure of water at the bottom of an
ocean for the scientists argued the fish would
be crushed to death by the thousands of tons of water
above it not only that but they argued further
that as it gets colder as one descends into the depths
of the ocean the temperature finally drops below
the freezing point of fresh water how then could
a fish live in such an abode it was simply impos-
sible the fish might just as well live in a frying
pan the arguments were strong indeed against the
possibility of life at the bottom of the sea

  but then the challenger expedition came along
and carried on deep-sea dredging no sooner had
this expedition begun to dredge than they fished
from the bottom of the ocean a most astounding
specimen of deep sea fish built on a plan to with-
stand enormous pressures true it was dead when
it arrived at the surface of the ocean but it was to
be expected for as soon as the enormous pressure
to which the fish was accustomed was taken away
he naturally burst inside so our wise scientists
with their beautiful logic were wrong once more and
the impossible as always was found to be very
much possible

  i mention this only in passing to show you that
life can accustom itself to almost any condition
there are very few exceptions indeed to this rule
it seems to me therefore we have absolutely no
right to believe that the little planet earth among
the billions of the worlds should be the only fortu-
nate one on which life thrives arrhennius has

demonstrated already how life is propagated from
one planet to another this famous philosopher has
shown that minute life-carrying spores so small
that they cannot be seen by the naked eye are car-
ried through space propelled by the pressure of the
sunlight til they strike another heavenly body if
the conditions are suitable the spore will germinate
in time and life will spring up-if it is not there
already-on that world it has been proved that
these spores can exist in an absolute zero and in a
perfect vacuum for years without losing their
germination power-another proof how nature pro-
tects life under almost unbelievable conditions
therefore to say that there is life only on the earth
is not only idiotic in the extreme but it also reveals
a total lack of appreciation of the wisdom of al-
mighty nature

  now it is also an indisputable fact that plants
animals and humans too are entirely dependent
upon their surroundings if for instance you take
an eskimo and transplant him and his family on an
island under the equator his light color will change
into black in a few generations likewise evolution
shows that the human body very quickly adapts itsel f
to the tasks imposed upon it thus a man whose
grandfather and father were hard-working laborers
will nine times out of ten inherit a bony as well as
robust body and a relatively small brain whereas
a man whose grandfather and father were mathe-
maticians nine times out of ten will have a compara-
tively small-boned body which is far from robust
but his brain will be large

  surroundings are everything and given time they
will transform man or animal into different beings

  now let us apply this reasoning to mars and let
us see what we will find to begin it has been
proved beyond dispute that mars has an atmosphere
which although thinner than that of the earth is
probably thick enough to sustain human life even
as we know it professor lowell has proved that
the mean temperature on mars is about  degrees
fahrenheit in some sections near the equator for
instance the temperature can be less than  de-
grees fahrenheit it was argued in former years
that on account of the far greater distance mars is
removed from the sun than the earth the tempera-
ture must be far below zero recent astronomical
researches however completely disproved this as
a matter of fact mars proper receives really more
heat than does the earth for the following reasons
the martian atmosphere is much thinner than the
terrestrial consequently the suns rays pierce it
with far less loss than is the case on earth then
too there are no clouds on mars to cut off almost
 per cent of the received suns rays as is the
actual case on earth

  then again the martian day is almost exactly
as long as the terrestrial also due to the inclination
of the martian axis which is almost exactly the same
as that of the earth the seasons are like the ter-
restrial ones except that they are twice as long
because the martian year is just twice as long as the
terrestrial one

  now we know that the planet mars due to its
small size has an older life history than the earth
civilization on mars must date back several hundred
thousand years the law of evolution teaches us
that we must therefore expect a very cultured as
well as accomplished race

  as our terrestrial evolution shows the human
bakon munchhausen



head is growing larger and larger all the time it
must have been the same on mars for conditions
there are almost the same as on earth we must
therefore expect to find a race with enormous heads
as the air is thinner on mars sound will not carry
as well as in a thicker atmosphere therefore we
must expect big funnel-like ears on the martians
and since a big head almost invariably has big eyes
we may safely deduce that the martians have large
eyes but there is one important difference of physi-
cal conditions on mars as compared with those on
earth-namely gravitation for what weighs one
pound on earth weighs but  pound or a little
over one-third pound on mars less bodily weight
makes for excessive growth for the reason that
gravity pulls less on the body frame a little cal-
culation based upon the above gravitational figures
leads us to suspect that the average martian should

mals breathe through their noses as a rule

  as to the martians hands it is probable we will
find them rather small in proportion to the rest of
the body the martians have probably advanced so
far that manual labor has been abolished for hun-
dreds of generations it is almost certain that as
everything must be done with machinery manual
labor is absolutely unknown today on mars this
naturally in the course of several thousand years
begins to tell and the hands must shrink we may
therefore expect that the eight-foot martian has a
hand rather smaller than ours again as no physi-
cal labor of any sort is performed by the martian
his arms are probably thin and muscleless

  as to his feet we shall in all probability find
them to be very large they must support a tall and
rather heavy body and they must therefore provide
sufficient area to enable the martian to walk prop-

         our friend the baron is quite impressed by the canals of mars and it would seem to be no wonder when we examine the illustra-
         tions above which we have just received from the lowell observatory at flaggstaff arizona giving us the latest telescopic views of the
         planet it will be seen that the canals in many cases practically straight or are almost on the great circles of the planet suggesting
         very strongly artificial construction while some of them which are curved are so regularly placed as to emphasize the idea that they

were constructed by inteuigent beings

be about eight feet tall as the sunlight is very
much stronger on account of the thin air on mars
the martian unless he is in the shade most of the
time probably has a dark skin which may be as
red as that of a north american indian or as dark
as that of a west indian

  as the air is so thin on mars and as oxygen is
needed in large quantities for such big bodies as the
martians we will not be surprised to find that the
martian has an immense torso to accommodate his
ponderous lungs the latter must be doubly large
in order to sustain such a large body and also to
work over quickly the small volume of oxygen in
the thin air but large lungs also invariably require
a large nose as we know from experience on earth
consequently if the martians have a ponderous nose
dont be surprised for evolution shows us that ani-

erly also the feet must be large on account of
mars small gravitational attraction for if the mar-
tians feet were small he could not secure the proper
foothold to propel his body he would be hopping
instead of walking

  therefore when we behold the first martian we
will probably find him totally different in looks from
a human being and while my reasoning as to his
probable appearance may be inaccurate in spots i
am sure that on the whole i will be correct

chapter i
the passing of a kingdom

ince the comparatively recent resume
of the ancient order of agriculture i
nathano have been asked to set down
the extraordinary events of the past
two thousand years at the beginning of
which time the supremacy of man chief of the mam-
mals threatened to come to an untimely end

  ever since the dawn of life upon this globe life
which it seemed had crept from the slime of the sea
only two great types had been the rulers the rep-
tiles and the mammals the former held undisputed
sway for eons but gave way eventually before the
smaller but intellectually superior mammals man
himself the supreme example of the ability of life
to govern and control inanimate matter was master
of the world with apparently none to dispute his
right yet so blinded was he with pride over the
continued exercise of his power on earth over other
lower types of mammals and the nearly extinct
reptiles that he failed to notice the slow but steady
rise of another branch of life different from his
own smaller it is true but no smaller than he had
been in comparison with the mighty reptilian mon-
sters that roamed the swamps in mesozoic times

  these new enemies of man though seldom attack-
ing him personally threatened his downfall by de-
stroying his chief means of sustenance so that by
the close of the twentieth century strange and dar-
ing projects were laid before the various govern-
ments of the world with an idea of fighting mans
insect enemies to the finish these pests were grow-
ing in size multiplying so rapidly and destroying
so much vegetation that eventually no plants would
be left to sustain human life humanity suddenly
woke to the realization that it might suffer the fate
of the nearly extinct reptiles would mankind be
able to prevent the encroachment of the insects
and at last man knew that unless drastic measures
were taken at once a third great class of life was
on the brink of terrestrial sovereignty

  of course no great changes in development come
suddenly slow evolution-
ary progress had brought
us up to the point where
with the application of
outside pressure we were
ready to handle a situation
that a century before
would have overwhelmed
us

  i	reproduce here in part
a lecture delivered by a
great american scientist a
talk which sent by radio
throughout the world changed the destiny of man-
kind  but whether for good or for evil i will leave
you to judge at the conclusion of this story

  only in comparatively recent times has man
succeeded in conquering natural enemies flood
storm inclemency of climate distance and now we
face an encroaching menace to the whole of human-
ity have we learned more and more of truth and
of the laws that control matter only to succumb to
the first real danger that threatens us with extermi-
nation surely no matter what the cost you will
rally to the solution of our problem and i believe

  friends that i have discovered the answer to the
enigma

  i know that many of you like my friend pro-
fessor fair will believe my ideas too extreme but

i	am convinced that unless you are willing to put
behind you those notions which are old and not
utilitarian you cannot hope to cope with the present
situation

  already in the past few decades you have real-
ized the utter futility of encumbering yourselves
with superfluous possessions that had no useful vir-
tue but which for various sentimental reasons you
continued to hoard thus lessening the degree of your
lifes efficiency by using for it time and attention
that should have been applied to the practical work
of lifes accomplishments you have given these
things up slowly but i am now going to ask you to
relinquish the rest of them quickly everything that
interferes in any way with the immediate disposal
of our enemies the insects

  at this point it seems that my worthy ancestor
professor fair objected to the scientists words
asserting that efficiency at the expense of some of
the sentimental virtues was undesirable and not
conducive to happiness the real goal of man the
scientist in his turn argued that happiness was
available only through a perfect adaptability to ones
environment and that efficiency sans love mercy
and the softer sentiments was the short cut to
human bliss

  it took a number of years for the scientist to put
over his scheme of salvation but in the end he
succeeded not so much from the persuasiveness of
his words as because prompt action of some sort
was necessary there was not enough food to
feed the people of the earth fruit and vegetables
were becoming a thing of the past too much pro-
tein food in the form of meat and fish was injuring
the race and at last the people realized that for
fruits and vegetables or their nutritive equivalent
they must turn from the field to the laboratory
from the farmer to the chemist synthetic food
was the solution to the problem there was no
longer any use in planting and caring for food stuffs
destined to become the
nourishment of mans
most deadly enemy

  the last planting took
place in  but there
was no harvest the vora-
cious insects took every
green shoot as soon as it
appeared and even trees
that had previously with-
stood the attacks of the
huge insects were by this
time stripped of every
vestige of greenery

  the vegetable world suddenly ceased to exist
over the barren plains which had been gradually
filling with vast cities man-made fires brought dev-
astation to every living bit of greenery so that in
all the world there was no food for the insect pests

extract front the diary of delfair a descendant of
professor fair zvho had opposed the daring scientist

 our readers will remember the author of this story
 as the third price winner in our  price contest
 last year here again mrs harris shows her versatility by
 delving into the future and striking a novel chord in-
 sects were and still arc mans greatest enemies and will
 remain so for many years to come there is no telling
 that insects might not come into ascendancy once more
 at any time the picture which the author draws here
 therefore is certainly not too far fetched or impossible
 perhaps it is not even improbable


amazing stories

from the borders of the great state-city of
iowa  was witness to the passing of one of
the great kingdoms of earth-the vegetable
and i can not find words to express the grief that
overwhelms me as i write of its demise for i loved
all growing things many of us realized that earth
was no longer beautiful but if beauty meant death
better life in the sterility of the metropolis

  the viciousness of the thwarted insects was a
menace that we had foreseen and yet failed to take
into adequate account on the city-state borderland
life is constantly imperiled by the attacks of well
organized lodies of our dreaded foe

  note the organization that now exists among
the ants bees and other insects testifies to the pos-
sibility of the development of military tactics among
them in the centuries to come

  robbed of their source of food they have become
emboldened to such an extent that they will take any
risks to carry human beings away for food and after
one of their well organized raids the toll of human
life is appalling

  but the great chemical laboratories where our syn-
thetic food is made and our oxygen plants we
thought were impregnable to their attacks in that
we were mistaken

  let me say briefly that since the destruction of all
vegetation which furnished a part of the oxygen
essential to human life it became necessary to manu-
facture this gas artificially for general diffusion
through the atmosphere

   was flying to my work which is in oxygen plant
no  when i noticed a peculiar thing on the upper
speedway near food plant no  although it
was night the various levels of the state-city were
illuminated as brightly as by day a pleasure vehicle
was going with prodigious speed westward i looked
after it in amazement it was unquestionably the
car of eric my co-worker at oxygen plant no 

i recognized the gay color of its body but to verify
my suspicions beyond the question of a doubt i
turned my volplane in pursuit and made out the fa-
miliar license number what was eric doing away
from the plant before i had arrived to relieve him
from duty

  in hot pursuit i sped above the car to the very
border of the state-city wondering what unheard of
errand took him to the land of the enemy for the
car came to a sudden stop at the edge of what had
once been an agricultural area miles ahead of me
stretched an enormous expanse of black sterility at
my back was the teeming metropolis five levels high
-if one counted the hangar-level which did not
cover the residence sections

  i had not long to wait for almost immediately my
friend appeared what a sight he presented to my
incredulous gaze he was literally covered from
head to foot with the two-inch ants that next to the
beetles had proved the greatest menace in their at-
tacks upon humanity with wild incoherent cries he
fled over the rock and stubble-burned earth

  as soon as my stunned senses permitted i
swooped down toward him to effect a rescue but
even as my plane touched the barren earth i saw
that i was too late for he fell borne down by the
vicious attacks of his myriad foes i knew it was
useless for me to set foot upon the ground for my
fate would le that of eric i rose ten feet and seiz-
ing my poison-gas weapon let its contents out upon

the liny black evil things that swarmed below i did
not bother with my mask for i planned to rise im-
mediately and it was not a moment too soon from
across the waste-land a dark cloud eclipsed the stars
and i saw coming toward me a horde of flying ants
interspersed with larger flying insects all bent upon
my annihilation i now took my mask and prepared
to turn more gas upon my pursuers but alas i had
used every atom of it in my attack upon the non-
flying ants i had no recourse but flight and to this
i immediately resorted knowing that i could outdis-
tance my pursuers

  when  could no longer see them i removed my
gas mask a suffocating sensation seized me i
could not breathe how high had i flown in my
endeavor to escape the flying ants i leaned over the
side of my plane expecting to see the city far far
below me what was my utter amazement when i
discovered that i was scarcely a thousand feet high
it was not altitude that was depriving me of the life-
giving oxygen

  a drop of three hundred feet showed me inert
specks of humanity lying about the streets then i
knew the oxygen plant mis not in operation in
another minute  had on my oxygen mask which was
attached to a small portable tank for emergency use
and i rushed for the vicinity of the plant there i
witnessed the first signs of life men equipped with
oxygen masks were trying to force entrance into the
locked building being an employee i possessed
knowledge of the combination of the great lock and
i opened the door only to be greeted by a swarm ol
ants that commenced a concerted attack upon us

  the floor seemed to be covered with a moving
black rug the corner nearest the door appearing
to unravel as we entered and it was but a few
seconds before we were covered with the clinging
biting creatures who fought with a supernatural
energy born of despair two very active ants
succeeded in getting under my helmet the bite
of their sharp mandibles and the effect of their
poisonous formic acid became intolerable did i
dare remove my mask while the air about me was
foul with the gas discharged from the weapons of
my allies while i felt the attacks elsewhere upon
my body gradually diminishing as the insects suc-
cumbed to the deadly fumes the two upon my face
waxed more vicious under the protection of my
mask one at each eye they were trying to blind
me the pain was unbearable better the suffo-
cating death-gas than the torture of lacerated eyes
frantically i removed the head-gear and tore at
the shiny black fiends strange to tell i discovered
that i could breathe near the vicinity of the great
oxygen tanks where enough oxygen lingered to
support life at least temporarily the two vicious
insects no longer protected by my gas-mask scur-
ried from me like rats from a sinking ship and dis-
appeared behind the oxygen tanks

  this attack of our enemies though unsuccessful
on their part was dire in its significance for it had
shown more cunning and ingenuity than anything
that had ever preceded it heretofore their on-
slaughts had been confined to direct attacks upon
us personally or upon the synthetic-food lalorato-
ries but in this last raid they had shown an amazing
cleverness that portended future disaster unless they
were checked at once it was obvious they had in-
geniously planned to smother us by the suspension
the miracle of the lily



of work at the oxygen plant knowing that they
themselves could exist in an atmosphere containing
a greater percentage of carbon-dioxide their
scheme then was to raid our laboratories for food

chapter iii
lucanus the last

a continuation of dclfairs account

although it was evident that the cessation
of all plant-life spelled inevitable doom for
 the insect inhabitants of earth their exter-
mination did not follow as rapidly as one might
have supposed there were years of internecine
warfare the insects continued to thrive though in
decreasing numbers upon stolen laboratory foods
bodies of human-beings and finally upon each other
at first capturing enemy species and at last even
resorting to a cannibalistic procedure their rapacity
grew in inverse proportion to their waning num-
bers until the meeting of even an isolated insect
might mean death unless one were equipped with
poison gas and prepared to use it upon a seconds
notice

  i am an old man now though i have not yet lived
quite two centuries but i am happy in the knowledge
that i have lived to see the last living insect which
was held in captivity it was an excellent specimen
of the stag-beetle lucanus and the years have
testified that it was the sole survivor of a form of
life that might have succeeded man upon this planet
this beetle was caught weeks after we had pre-
viously seen what was supposed to be the last living
thing upon the globe barring man and the sea-life
untiring search for years has failed to reveal any
more insects so that at last man rests secure in the
knowledge that he is monarch of all he surveys

  i have heard that long long ago man used to
gaze with a fearful fascination upon the reptilian
creatures which he displaced and just so did he
view this lone specimen of a type of life that might
have covered the face of the earth but for mans
ingenuity

  it was this unholy lure that drew me one day to
view the captive beetle in his cage in district 
at universapolis i was amazed at the size of the
creature for it looked larger than when i had seen
it by television but i reasoned that upon that occa-
sion there had been no object near with which to
compare its size true the broadcaster had an-
nounced its dimensions but the statistics concretely
given had failed to register a perfect realization of
its prodigious proportions

  as  approached the cage the creature was lying
with its dorsal covering toward me and i judged
it measured fourteen inches from one extremity to
the other its smooth horny sheath gleamed in the
bright artificial light it was confined on the third
level as i stood there mentally conjuring a pic-
ture of a world overrun with billions of such crea-
tures as the one before me the keeper approached
the cage with a meal-portion of synthetic food al-
though the food has no odor the beetle sensed the
mans approach for it rose on its jointed legs and
came toward us its horn-like prongs moving threat-
eningly then apparently remembering its confine-
ment and the impotency of an attack it subsided
and quickly ate the food which had been placed
within its prison

  the food consumed it lifted itself to its hind
legs partially supported by a box and turned its
great eyes upon me i had never been regarded
with such utter malevolence before the detestation
was almost tangible and i shuddered involuntarily
as plainly as if he spoke i knew that lucanus was
perfectly cognizant of the situation and in his gaze
i read the concentrated hate of an entire defeated
race

  i had no desire to gloat over his misfortune rather
a great pity toward him welled up within me i pic-
tured myself alone the last of my kind held up for
ridicule before the swarming hordes of insects who
had conquered my people and i knew that life
would no longer be worth the living

  whether he sensed my pity or not i do not know
but he continued to survey me with unmitigated
rage as if he would convey to me the information
that his was an impacable hatred that would outlast
eternity

  not long after this he died and a world long
since intolerant of ceremony surprised itself by
interring the beetles remains in a golden casket
accompanied by much pomp andsplendor

  i have lived many long years since that memor-
able event and undoubtedly my days here are num-
bered but i can pass on happily convinced that in
this sphere mans conquest of his environment is
supreme

chapter iv
efficiency maximum

hi a direct line of descent from professor fair and
delfair the author of the preceding chapter comes

  tlianor zvhose journal is given in this chapter

am t a true product of the year  some-
times t am convinced that i am hopelessly
 old-fashioned an anachronism that should
have existed a thousand years ago in no other
way can i account for the dissatisfaction  feel in
a world where efficiency has at last reached a
maximum

  i am told that i spring from a line of ancestors
who were not readily acclimated to changing con-
ditions i love beauty yet i see none of it here
there are many who think our lofty buildings that
tower two and three thousand feet into the air are
beautiful but while they are architectural splendors
they do not represent the kind of loveliness i crave
only when i visit the sea do i feel any satisfaction
for a certain yearning in my soul the ocean alone
shows the handiwork of god the land bears evi-
dence only of man

  as i read back through the diaries of my senti-
mental ancestors i find occasional glowing descrip-
tions of the world that was the world before the
insects menaced human existence trees plants and
flowers brought delight into the lives of people as
they wandered among them in vast open spaces 
am told where the earth was soft beneath the feet
and flying creatures called birds sang among the
greenery true i learn that many people had not
enough to eat and that uncontrollable passions gov-
erned them but i do believe it must have been more
interesting than this methodical unemotional exist-
ence i can not understand why many people were
poor for i am told that nature as manifested in


amazing stories

the vegetable kingdom was very prolific so much
so that year after year quantities of food rotted on
the ground the fault  find by my reading was
not with nature but with mans economic system
which is now perfect though this perfection really
brings few of us happiness i think

  now there is  waste all is converted into food
long ago man learned how to reduce all matter to
its constituent elements of which there are nearly
a hundred in number and from them to rebuild
compounds for fowl the old axiom that nothing
is created or destroyed but merely changed from
one form to another has stood the test of ages
man as the agent of god has simply performed
the miracle of transmutation himself instead of wait-
ing for natural forces to accomplish it as in the
old days

  at first humanity wras horrified when it was de-
creed that it must relinquish its dead to the labora-
tory for too many eons had man closely asso-
ciated the soul and body failing to comprehend
the body as merely a material agent through which
the spirit functioned when man knew at last of
the eternal qualities of spirit he ceased to regard
the discarded body with reverential awe and sawr in
it only the same molecular constituents which com-
prised all matter about him he recognized only
material basically the same as that of stone or metal
material to lie reduced to its atomic elements and
rebuilt into matter that would render service to liv-
ing humanity that portion of matter wherein spirit
functions

  the drab monotony of life is appalling is it
possible that man had reached his height a thousand
years ago and should have been willing to resign
earths sovereignty to a coming order of creatures
destined to be mans worthy successor in the eons
to come it seems that life is interesting only when
there is a struggle a goal to be reached through an
evolutionary process once the goal is attained all
progress ceases the huge reptiles of preglacial
ages rose to supremacy by virtue of their great size
and yet was it not the excessive bulk of those crea-
tures that finally wiped them out of existence
nature it seems avoids extremes she allows the
fantastic to develop for awhile and then wipes the
slate clean for a new order of development is it
not conceivable that man could destroy himself
through excessive development of his nervous system
and give place for the future evolution of a com-
paratively simple form of life such as the insects
were at mans height of development this it
seems to me was the great plan a scheme with
which man dared to interfere and for which lie is
now paying by the boredom of existence

  the earths population is decreasing so rapidly
that i fear another thousand years will see a life-
less planet hurtling through space it seems to me
that only a miracle will save us now

chapter v
the year 

the original writer nathano resumes
the narrative

my ancestor thanor of ten centuries ago
according to the records he gave to my
great grandfather seems to voice the gen-
eral despair of humanity which bad enough in his

times lias reached the nth power in my day a
soulless world is gradually dying from self-inflicted
boredom

  as i have ascertained from the perusal of the
journals of my forebears even antedating the ex-
termination of the insects i come of a stock that
clings with sentimental tenacity to the things that
made life worth while in the old days if the world
at large knew of my emotional musings concerning
past ages it would scarcely tolerate me but surt
rounded by my thought-insulator i often indulge
in what fancies i will and such meditation coupled
with a love for a few ancient relics from the past
have led me to a most amazing discovery

  several months ago i found among my family
relics a golden receptacle two feet long one and
a half in width and one in depth which i found
upon opening to contain many tiny square com-
partments each filled with minute objects of slightly
varying size texture and color

  not sand i exclaimed as i closely examined
the little particles of matter

  food after eating some t was convinced that
their nutritive value was small in comparison with
a similar quantity of the products of our laboratories
what were the mysterious objects

  just as i was about to close the lid again con-
vinced that i had one over-sentimental ancestor
whose gift to posterity was absolutely useless my
pocket-radio buzzed and the voice of my friend
stentor the interplanetary broadcaster issued from
the tiny instrument

  if youre going to be home this afternoon said
stentor ill skate over i have some interesting
news

  i consented for i thought i would share my
find with this friend whom i loved above all
others but before he arrived i had again hidden
my golden chest for i had decided to await the
development of events before sharing its mysteri-
ous secret with another tt was well that i did this
for stentor was so filled with the importance of
his own news that he could have given me little
attention at first

  well what is your interesting news i asked
after he was comfortably seated in my adjustable
chair

  youd never guess he replied with irritating
leisureliness

  does it pertain to mars or venus i queried
what news of our neighbor planets

  you may know it has nothing to do with the
self-satisfied martians answered the broadcaster
but the vcnusians have a very serious problem
confronting them it is in connection with the same
old difficulty they have had ever since interplanetary
radio was developed forty years ago you remem-
ber that in their second communication with us
they told us of their continual warfare  insect
pests that were destroying all vegetable food well
last night after general broadcasting had ceased i
was surprised to hear the voice of the venusian
broadcaster he is suggesting that we get up a
scientific expedition to venus to help the natives of
his unfortunate planet solve their insect problem as
we did ours he says the martians turn a deaf
ear to their plea for help but he exacts sympathy
and assistance from earth who has so recently
solved these problems for herself
the miracle of the lily



  i was dumbfounded at stentors news

  but the venusians are farther advanced me-
chanically than we i objected though they are
behind us in the natural sciences they could much
more easily solve the difficulties of space-flving
than we could

   that is true agreed stentor but if we are to
render them material aid in freeing their world from
devastating insects we must get to venus the
past four decades have proved that we can not help
them merely by verbal instructions

  now last night stentor continued with warm-
ing enthusiasm wanyana the venusian broad-
caster informed me that scientists on venus are
developing interplanetary television this if suc-
cessful will prove highly beneficial in facilitating
communication and it may even do away with the
necessity of interplanetary travel which i think is
centuries ahead of us yet

  television though so common here on earth
and on venus has seemed an impossibility across
the ethereal void i said but if it becomes a reality
i believe it will be the venusians who will take the
initiative though of course they will be helpless
without our friendly cooperation in return for the
mechanical instructions they have given us from time
to time i think it no more than right that we should
try to give them all the help possible in freeing their
world as ours has been freed of the insects that
threaten their very existence personally therefore
i hope it can be done through radio and television
rather than by personal excursions

   i believe you are right he admitted but i hope
we can be of service to them soon ever since i
have served in the capacity of official interplanetary
broadcaster i have liked the spirit of good fellowship
shown by the venusians through their spokesman
wanyana the impression is favorable in contrast
to the superciliousness of the inhabitants of mars
we conversed for some time but at length he
rose to take his leave it was then i ventured to
broach the subject that was uppermost in my
thoughts

  i want to show you something stentor i said
going into an adjoining room for my precious box
and returning shortly with it a relic from the
days of an ancestor named del fair who lived at
the time the last insect a beetle was kept in cap-
tivity judging from his personal account delfair
was fully aware of the significance of the changing
times in which he lived and contrary to the majority
of his contemporaries possessed a sentimentality of
soul that has proved an historical asset to future
generations look my friend these he left to
posterity

  i deposited the heavy casket on a table between
us and lifted the lid revealing to stentor the mysti-
fying particles

  the face of stentor was eloquent of astonish-
ment not unnaturally his mind took somewhat the
same route as mine had followed previously though
lie added atomic-power-units to the list of possibili-
ties he shook his head in perplexity

  whatever they are there must have been a real
purpose behind their preservation he said at last
you say this old delfair witnessed the passing of
the insects what sort of a fellow was he likely
to be up to any tricks

  not at all i asserted rather indignantly he

seemed a very serious minded chap worked in an
oxygen-plant and took an active part in the last
warfare between men and insects

  suddenly stentor stooped over and scooped up
some of the minute particles into the palm of his
hand-and then he uttered a maniacal shriek and
flung them into the air

  great god man do you know what they are
he screamed shaking violently

  no i do not i replied quietly with an attempt
at dignity i did not feel

  insect eggs he cried and shuddering with ter-
ror he made for the door

  i caught him on the threshold and pulled him
forcibly back into the room

  now see here i said sternly not a word of
this to anyone do you understand i will test
out your theory in every possible way but i want
no public interference

  at first he was obstinate but finally yielded to
threats when supplications were impotent

  i will test them i said and will endeavor to
keep hatchings under absolute control should they
prove to be what you suspect

  it was time for the evening broadcasting so he
left promising to keep our secret and leaving me
regretting that i had taken another into my
confidence

chapter vi

 the miracle

for days following my unfortunate experience
with stentor i experimented upon the tiny
objects that had so terrified him i subjected
them to various tests for the purpose of ascertaining
whether or not they bore evidence of life whether
in egg pupa or larva stages of development and
to all my experiments there was but one answer
no life was manifest yet i was not satisfied for
chemical tests showed that they were composed of
organic matter here was an inexplicable enigma
many times i was on the verge of consigning the
entire contents of the chest to the flames i seemed
to see in my minds eye the world again over-ridden
with insects and that calamity due to the indis-
cretions of one man my next impulse was to turn
over my problem to scientists when a suspicion of
the truth dawned upon me these were seeds the
germs of plant-life and they might grow but alas
where over all the earth man has spread his arti-
ficial dominion the state-city has been succeeded
by what could be termed the nation-city for one
great floor of concrete or rock covers the country

  i resolved to try an experiment the far-reaching
influence of which i did not at that time suspect
beneath the lowest level of the community edifice
in which i dwell i removed by means of a small
atomic excavator a slab of concrete large enough
to admit my body i let myself down into the hole
and felt my feet resting on a soft dark substance 
that t knew to be dirt i hastily filled a box of
this and after replacing the concrete slab returned
to my room where i proceeded to plant a variety
of the seeds

  being a product of an age when practically to
wish for a thing in a material sense is to have it i
experienced the greatest impatience while waiting
for any evidences of plant-life to become manifest


amazing stories

daily yes hourly i watched the soil for signs of a
type of life long since departed from the earth and
was about convinced that the germ of life could not
have survived the centuries when a tiny blade of
green proved to me that a miracle more wonderful
to me than the works of man through the ages was
taking place before my eyes this was an enigma
so complex and yet so simple that one recognized in
it a direct revelation of nature

  daily and weekly i watched in secret the botanical
miracle it was my one obsession i was amazed
at the fascination it held for me-a man who viewed
the marvels of the thirty-fourth century with unemo-
tional complacency it showed me that nature is
manifest in the simple things which mankind has
chosen to ignore

  then one morning when t awoke a white blossom
displayed its immaculate beauty and sent forth its
delicate fragrance into the air the lily a symbol of
new life resurrection i felt within me the stirring
of strange emotions i had long believed dead in the
bosom of man but the message must not be for
me alone as of old the lily would be the symbol
of life for all

  with trembling hands i carried my precious bur-
den to a front window where it might be witnessed
by all who passed by the first day there were few
who saw it for only rarely do men and women walk
they usually ride in speeding vehicles of one kind
or another or employ electric skates a delightful
means of locomotion which gives the body some
exercise the fourth city level which is reserved
for skaters and pedestrians is kept in a smooth
glass-like condition and so it was only the occa-
sional pedestrian walking on the outer border of
the fourth level upon which my window faced who
first carried the news of the growing plant to the
world and it was not long before it was necessary
for civic authorities to disperse the crowds that
thronged to my window for a glimpse of a miracle
in green and white

  when i showed my beautiful plant to stentor he
was most profuse in his apology and came to my
rooms every day to watch it unfold and develop but
the majority of people long used to business-like
efficiency were intolerant of the sentimental emo-
tions that swayed a small minority and i was com-
manded to dispose of the lily but a figurative seed
had been planted in the human heart a seed that
could not be disposed of so readily and this seed
ripened and grew until it finally bore fruit

chapter vii
ex terreno

it is a very different picture of humanity that
i paint ten years after the last entry in my
diary my new vocation is farming but it is
farming on a far more intensive scale than had
been done two thousand years ago our crops
never fail for temperature and rainfall are regu-
lated artificially but we attribute our success prin-
cipally to the total absence of insect pests our
small agricultural areas dot the country like the parks
of ancient days and supply us with a type of food
no more nourishing but more appetizing than that
produced in the laboratories truly we are living
in a marvelous age if the earth is ours completely
why may we not turn our thoughts toward the other

planets in our solar-system for the past ten or
eleven years the venusians have repeatedly urged
us to come and assist them in their battle for life

i believe it is our duty to help them

  tomorrow will be a great day for us and especially
for stentor as the new interplanetary television is
to be tested and it is possible that for the first time
in history we shall see our neighbors in the infinity
of space although the people of venus were about
a thousand years behind us in many respects they
have made wonderful progress with radio and tele-
vision we have been in radio communication with
them for the last half century and they shared with
us the joy of the establishment of our eden they
have always been greatly interested in hearing
stentor tell the story of our subjugation of the in-
sects that threatened to wipe us out of existence
for they have exactly that problem to solve now
judging from their reports we fear that theirs is
a losing battle to-morrow we shall converse face
to face with the venusians it will be an event
second in importance only to the first radio com-
munications interchanged fifty years ago stentors
excitement exceeds that displayed at the time of
the discovery of the seeds

  well it is over and the experiment was a success
but alas for the revelation

  the great assembly halls all over the continent
were packed with humanity eager to catch a first
glimpse of the venusians prior to the test we
sent our message of friendship and good will by
radio and received a reciprocal one from our inter-
planetary neighbors alas we were ignorant at
that time then the television receiving apparatus
was put into operation and we sat with breathless-
interest our eyes intent upon the crystal screen
before us i sat near stentor and noted the feverish
ardor with which he watched for the first glimpse
of wanyana

  at first hazy mist-like spectres seemed to glide
across the screen we knew these figures were not
in correct perspective finally one object gradu-
ally became more opaque its outlines could be seen
clearly then across that vast assemblage as well
as thousands of others throughout the world there
swept a wave of speechless horror as its full signifi-
cance burst upon mankind

  the figure that stood facing us was a huge six-
legged beetle not identical in every detail with our
earthly enemies of past years but unmistakably an
insect of gigantic proportions of course it could
not see us for our broadcaster was not to appear
until afterward but it spoke and we had to close
our eyes to convince ourselves that it was the familiar
voice of wanyana the leading venusian radio
broadcaster stentor grabbed my arm uttered an
inarticulate cry and would have fallen but for my
timely support

  friends of earth as you call your world began
the object of horror this is a momentous occasion
in the annals of the twin planets and we are looking
forward to seeing one of you and preferably sten-
tor for the first time as you arc now viewing one
of us we have listened many times with interest
to your story of the insect pests which threatened to
follow you as lords of your planet as you have
often heard us tell we are likewise molested with
insects our fight is a losing one unless we can
soon exterminate them
the miracle of the lily



  suddenly the venusian was joined by another
being a colossal ant who bore in his fore-legs a
tiny light-colored object which he handed to the
beetle-announcer who took it and held it forward
for our closer inspection it seemed to be a tiny
ape but was so small we could not ascertain for a
certainty we were convinced however that it
was a mammalian creature an insect pest of
venus yet in it we recognized rudimentary man
as we know him on earth

  there was no question as to the direction in which
sympathies instinctively turned yet reason told us
that our pity should be given to the intelligent reign-
ing race who had risen to its present mental attain-
ment through eons of time by some quirk or freak
of nature way back in the beginning life had de-
veloped in the form of insects instead of mammals
or the thought was repellent had insects in the
past succeeded in displacing mammals as they might
have done here on earth

  there was no more television that night stentor
would not appear so disturbed was he by the sight

of the venusians bat in the morning he talked to
them by radio and explained the very natural an-
tipathy we experienced in seeing them or in having
them see us

  now they no longer urge us to construct ether-
ships and go to help them dispose of their insects
i think they are afraid of us and their very fear
has aroused in mankind an unholy desire to con-
quer them

  i am against it have we not had enough of war
in the past we have subdued our own world and
should be content with that instead of seeking new
worlds to conquer but life is too easy here i
can plainly see that much as he may seem to dis-
like it man is not happy unless he has some enemy
to overcome some difficulty to surmount

  alas my greatest fears for man were groundless

  a short time ago when t went out into my field
to see how my crops were faring  found a six-
pronged beetle voraciously eating no-man will
not need to go to venus to fight insects

               the end

when hearts remember home

 eternity is calling
 above the zigzag trail
 that climbs the furrowed mountain wall
 high over brook and dale

 mv child if you are weary

 my life if you are sad

 look far far up to cloudless blue
 and let your heart be glad

 when darkness fills the valley

 and slopes and peaks are dim
 infinity comes whispering
 above the mountain rim

 my child if you are tired
 of earth of toil or play

 glance up and see the universe
 aglow with endless day

amazing stories in its new size

n the third anniversary of
amazing stories we take
pleasure in presenting the maga-
zine in its new size the magazine has
been changed from its former page of
x inches to i he new one of xll
inches which now makes it a standard
size this means that we can give a little
more tejxt per page and that our illustra-
tions can be larger and that the size will
be much handier we have also improved
on the binding as many complaints were
received from readers that the magazine
fell apart after its back was broken it is
now side-wire stitched as are most maga-

zines and it is hoped that our readers
will like the improvements

  it will be noted that the magazine is a
great deal easier to handle than it was
before and beginning with the next is-
sue we shall use a much better and
easier reading type all the way through
and make certain other typographical im-
provements which we know you will like

  we shall be very glad to hear from you
if you approve of the changes and we
shall be glad to receive any other sugges-
tions that will tend to better amazing
stories still further

ancient horror

by fflal grant

his hand had barely grasped the oar again when silently from the blue depths there came into view just behind wilson the awful
head and neck of the creature we had dimly seen that night when we sat crouched on a shaky platform  up it rose to a height of
even or eight feet while i gazing upon its utter frightfulness stood paralyzed and dumb i saw its cavernous mouth fully three feet
from the snout to the angle of the jaw aw it open and reveal its gleaming needle-sharp teeth over the head of the unfortunate man
the ancient horror



will be interesting if they happen to
nd the lizard and it turns out to be the
al thing

what thing i asked rutherford
ad been reading the paper to himself
by way of reply he handed me the paper at the
same time pointing to a head-line carrying the in-
formation that scientists were on their way to africa
to search for a pre-historic monster seem by
hunters in northern african swamp

  from the writers description i gathered the
idea that the creature was supposed to belong to one
of the species of gigantic saurians that roamed the
earth during the reptilian age some five hundred
millions of years ago

  i thought the story a hoax and said so ruther-
ford didnt agree with me calling my attention to
the fact that the men-whose names were given-
were all well known which made it unlikely that
any writer would use them in connection with any-
thing that savoured of deceit

  i believe they have evidence warranting such an
expedition or they would not go moreover i shall
not be surprised to read at some future date that
they have discovered the thing whatever it is and
that it furnishes them with some very interesting
experiences

  well every one has a right to his opinion even
though he has no foundation upon which to base it
so i didnt argue with him beyond saying that i
presumed he had some very good reason for being
so positive

  perhaps he thought i was a trifle sarcastic at
any rate he looked at me through contracted eyes
for a moment as if trying to make up his mind about
something then having filled his pipe he reached
for a match and after lighting the tobacco he said
quietly yes i do believe there are living descend-
ants of those saurians and that they are in appear-
ance like the old fellows we read about also i
believe i have good reason for thinking there are
some that resemble no known species and since you
wont take any stock in my belief until you have
some proof i am going to give you some provided
of course that you will accept my unsupported
word that what i tell you
is true

  rutherford is not one
given to making statements
that are not true if he
says he knows a thing to be
so from personal knowl-
edge that settles it lie
always was that way even
in school more than
once i have known him to take a licking when by
simply mis-stating the facts he would have saved
himself knowng him as i did i told him to go
ahead and give me the proof if he wanted to but
that id take his word for the reason wthout any
further evidence i hadnt the slightest idea as to
what his proofs were or i should not have taken
the chance of missing them aside from a tale of
fiction ive never heard or read of anything that
approached his story for horror and the setting
was perfect rutherford and i alone in the hunt-
ing lodge on the shore of a northern lake at night
with the november wind howling through the trees
that surrounded the house on three sides and driving
torrents of rain and sleet against the windows and

upon the shakes that covered the roof an eerie
night for an eerie tale

  ive never told this story before he began be-
cause there is little chance of being thought any-
thing but a liar ive often wanted to tell it though
and this moment seems very opportune every word
is gospel truth

  in this case as in all others cause and effect are
operative he began if i hadnt caught the flu
in the winter of nineteen hundred and five i should
never have known anything about it

   had a pretty bad case of it and only by the
skin of my teeth did i manage to pull through
even at that i barely missed going west for i was
left with a lung complication that my doctor thought
was a touch of tb

  as soon as the weather permitted he ordered me
into the mountains for an indefinite time any place
he said where there are lots of pine trees and clean
air it seems odd that out of all the familiar places
on earth which i might have chosen i should have
selected a place i had never heard of before just
because the name when i read it on the route marked
out in a railway time table reminded me of a little
girl i used to like back in my school days

  maybe you will remember her elsie hampton
she went to school with us back thefe in stowe
vermont she lived back  the hill beyond the
big house that butler the hotel man built you
remember he never finished it got killed by be-
ing thrown out of his buggy while driving a crazy
horse drunk at the time if i remember correctly

  i nodded and refilling his obnoxious pipe he
went on

  thats how i happened to go to hampton and as
it turned out i would have had some trouble finding
a better place every thing considered if was two
thousand feet above sea level just at the edge of
the foothills there were plenty of pines firs and
balsams air as clear as crystal fishing and hunt-
ing till you couldnt rest and to make it more at-
tractive it was off the tourist track nobody ever
stopped there it was before the days of automo-
bile tramps and there was no such thing as a tour-
ist camp-

  but the town was mod-
ern and up-to-date pro-
vided with gas electricity
and a plentiful supply of
pure water piped from a
reservoir ten miles back
in the hills there had
been a hot controversy
over the construction of
the reservoir due to the heavy cost but the boosters
had won out and in the end every one was happy

  i had been there but a short while when things
began to happen that set the town by the ears par-
ticularly that part of the town that had opposed the
idea of putting in the reservoir one beautiful afteu-
noon just at the time the women were getting sup-
per started every tap in town went dry inside
of half an hour the water works department was be-
ing called up and called down by indignant house-
wives who wanted to know what had become of
their water supply

  well the department found it out almost as soon
as the women did and it wasnt long before the
engineers were loping along the pipe-line leading

 pre-iistoric monsters are no novelty in litera-
 ture but here is one so totally different and so well
 pieced together that by the time wc got through reading
 it we were not at all sure that our new authors story
 was not entirely truth wc promise you an interesting
 half-hour with this most excellent tale


amazing stories

to the reservoir followed by a crowd of idlers being
one of that class i was with them

   there was no break in the pipe and no cause for
the stoppage of the water ways found until the
reservoir was reached here they found cause in
plenty the huge artificial lake was dry and the
creek that fed it was pouring into a great hole in
the center of the basin near the dam and from the
roar that issued forth one could guess that the water
was falling some distance

   ordinarily a hole may be stopped up this was
more than a hole a continuous stream of water of
considerable size failed to fill it evidently there
was a cavern or a number of caverns underneath
the surface with outlets possibly sufficiently large
to carry away any overflow

  there were two newspapers in hampton one
backed up the boosters while the other stood with
the conservatives and the reservoir incident fur-
nished the rival papers with a plentiful supply of
material for publication

   as might be guessed the conservative organ was
mean and caustic of course nobody could have
foreseen such a catastrophe-for it amounted to that

   the other paper tried to explain and really did
explain the cause was entirely obvious the
creek for at least that part of it that had passed over
the spot where the hole now was had flowed over
the thin rock cover of an underground chamber or
chambers of huge dimensions in view of what
occurred a year later  believe there must have been
at least two or more this thin plate or cover had
been strong enough to support the weight of the
stream but it was constantly growing thinner and
it was apparently not strong enough to bear the
greater strain imposed upon it by the water in the
reservoir

   the conservative paper admitted this but tried
to convince its readers that the engineers should have
known from the formation of the rocks that such
an accident was liable to occur

   and so they went at it hammer and tongs until
like a bolt from the clear blue sky came another
phenomenal occurrence this i suppose might have
been anticipated although i dont see how

 a man by the name of wilson owned a large

   jt farm that abutted upon the creek in fact
a part of the lake formed by the reservoir encroached
upon wilsons property and would have covered a
large part of it were it not for a retaining wall that
had been built to keep the water back this wall
ran from a point near the upstream end of the reser-
voir to within a hundred feet of the dam the
remaining space was filled by a sort of mound
rising some fifteen feet or more above the surface
of the water at high level this mound was very
much like a turtles shell in shape a hundred
feet in length about fifty feet wide at its base i
mention the mound at this point in the story because
it played an important part in a later incident and
i want you to remember the details

   one morning while the principal topic of con-
versation was still the reservoir cave-in wilson came
into town all bet up winding up in the mayors
office he sprung a sensation upon that official by
declaring that his farm had sunk out of sight this
was to be sure a mean and unusual trick for a farm
to play upon its owner and the mayor was both as-
tonished and sympathetic wilson didnt want sym-

pathy he wanted damages which put an entirely
different light on the story at first the mayor
thought wilson was crazy but he soon changed his
mind and calling in the county attorney asked
wilson to tell the story in detail

  wilson said lie had been aroused from sleep by
a strange noise a sort of tearing sound mixed with
a great roar and upon getting up and going to his
window which faced the reservoir he had seen a
great gush of water spurting up through the hole in
its bed and that a few moments later there had
been another tearing crashing noise and all his best
garden land had broken away from higher and less
valuable land and dropped plum out of sight

  he was still standing open mouthed at the win-
dow when there came another explosion followed by
a tearing noise and a great chasm appeared in the
northern end of the depression into which his farm
had sunk and through this came a rushing volume of
water by this time wilson said he thought hed
better put  some clothes and investigate

  continuing he said that when lie reached the side
of the cave-in he saw that it was rapidly being filled
with water that came pouring into it through the rent
in the upper end he had watched until morning
when the water having reached a point a few inches
below the firm edge of his remaining land had
ceased to rise and lie concluded it had gone as high
as it ever would

  at first he was mystified but at last decided that
his misfortune was due to the cave-in of the reser-
voir the water having washed the underpinning from
beneath his property well both the mayor and the
county attorney agreed with him-forgetting in
the excitement induced by the fantastic story that
wilson was there to secure damages

  of course the mayor couldnt do anything for
wilson and the county attorney seeing no better
way out of the tangle advised the man to get a
lawyer and bring suit

  the case didnt come to trial-not then-for
the city figured a way out of the trouble into which
the cave-in had drawn it

  analysis showed that the water in the newly
formed lake was the same water the city had been
getting from the reservoir and so an appraiser fixed
a valuation upon the sunken property that satisfied
wilson and this settled preparations were begun
to connect up the lake with the pipe line

  but the chain of unusual happenings was not
yet at an end the day before wilson was to receive
the money for his land water began to flow through
the hundreds of taps that had been left open since
they ran dry a investigation revealed the fact
that the reservoir had begun to fill up again and
as soon as the news reached the county attorneys
office payment to wilson was held up pending such
a time as might be needed to show whether or not
the reservoir would fill and remain full

  when it became apparent that there was to be no
more trouble with the water supply the city called
the deal off wilson then took his case into court
and lost he carried it up on an appeal and lost
again the higher court sustaining the lower and jus-
tifying itself in so doing by stating that what had
occurred was an act of god for which the city
was not liable

  during the trial i lecame acquainted with wil-
son and afterwards he invited me out to his place

i was glad to go with him for his invitation carried
the ancient horror



with it the assurance of better conditions of living-
for me for i had been unable to secure suitable quar-
ters in any of the farm homes outside of hampton
 conjectured that if wilsons place suited my fancy
i could very likely make arrangements with him
which would enable me to remain at his place in-
definitely i did succeed in doing so and who knows
but that i might have met with the same unpleasant
experience he did had not fate willed it otherwise

  adventure like romance lies just around the
corner one does not need to go to africa as these
scientists are doing in order to find adventure any
more than it is necessary to go to europe for ro-
mance and the adventure ahead of me that summer
day as i sat in wilsons rattling flivver en route to
his place was very real no other man ever lived
through an experience more bizarre more horrible
than the one that was waiting for me at wilsons
place

  it didnt take us long to cover the distance be-
tween hampton and the farm which even with most
of the tillable land under water was a beautiful
place that part of the property covered with the
water from the reservoir had been practically the
only really flat land in the whole estate the rest was
rolling and hilly and for the most part covered with
timber the lake lay almost in the center of the
farm as wilson called it and while it completely
ruined the farm for agriculture it added immensely
to its charm and beauty roughly oval and nearly
a mile in diameter it twinkled in its bed like a great
sapphire encircled with emeralds owing to its depth
which according to wilsons estimate was some-
thing about five hundred feet the water would re-
main cold always which made it an ideal place for
any trout which entered from the creek to live and
breed in

  i said as much to wilson that evening after sup-
per evidently he had never thought of such a
thing his mind was centered upon his loss he
mulled the thing over in his mind for a moment and
as the possibilities of such a proposition grew upon
him he said if that danged lake had fish in it i
wouldnt take any price you could name for it i
could get more out of the water then than i ever
got out of the land and still own it and i knew
he was right given fish he had the world by the
tail it would make a wonderful summer resort
for cottages could be built along the lake which
would bring high rent for the season lie surely
needed fish

  and the fish came but not until we had about

  jt given up all hope that they would i had
become wilsons star boarder for he had invited me
to stay there as long as i liked as his guest i spent
the days helping wilson keep house he was a
widower for some years and wandered about the
lake looking for signs of fish

  then one afternoon just at sun-down i saw
one feap out of the water i shouted to wilson
who answered the call on the run and got there in
time to see another one jump up out of the blue
depths he gripped my arm and said rutherford
i shall need some help financially if you want to
go in with me well split the profits what do you
say i thought the matter over for a moment then
told him id furnish the needed capital we stayed
there at the side of the lake until dark talking
the matter over and watching the dollars as wil-

son was pleased to call the trout jump out of the
water we then went back to the house to make
further plans for the next season

  two weeks later we had a dozen summer cottages
well on the road toward completion we expected
to build more later but we figured a dozen to start
with would be sufficient which shows how nearly a
couple of greenhorns can come to making a correct
guess we could have rented a hundred if we had
them later i wished i had never thought of build-
ing a single cottage but who could have dreamed
of such consequence

  the cottages which were erected on a sufficiently
large cleared space on the southeast shore of the
lake were completed before the cold weather set in
and after closing the board shutters over the win-
dows to protect them from possible breakage we
devoted our time to planning a campaign for the
spring

  winter passed reluctantly it seemed to wilson
and me but it gave way to spring at last and shortly
after i went to the city there i had a series of talks
with certain dealers in fish which resulted as soon
as the fishing season opened in a big window display
of strings of trout that made the disciples of isaac
walton almost wild to swing a fly over their habitat
a carefully worded legend that accompanied the dis-
play gave the necessary information the season
opened with all our cottages occupied and we were
making money

t rry shortly after we began to hear strange
v noises in the night if we had been very
near a seaport town i should have thought the sound
though rather sharp was given by a ships siren
however since we were better than eighteen hundred
miles from the ocean and a thousand miles from
any other body of water large enough to float a ship
we concluded that it was a particularly awful whistle
on the railroad that ran some three miles to the west
of us it bothered us for about a week then like
all other noises that occur at frequent intervals it
ceased to bother us much there was some specula-
tion among the cottagers but when we told them it
probably came from some engine they accepted the
statement for fact and forgot all about it be-
sides what does a little noise amount to when the
fishing is good and it was

  there was only one fault to be found with our
lake or its environment owing to the altitude and
the added fact that it lay so deep down among the
hills the nights were too chilly to permit of comfort
on the lake after dark however there was plenty
of warmth during the daytime so it didnt matter
so very much

  along about the first part of july however we
had a stretch of very hot weather the warmth con-
tinued well into the night and the early evening
hours found the lake pretty well dotted with boats
and canoes passing back and forth near the shore
and pretty well out into the lake

  the first break in the calm order of our lives
came one evening during this hot spell wilson
and i were down at the lake cleaning some trout we
had caught it was about eight or a little later and
it was getting dark rapidly we had practically no
twilight we had just finished our job when a long
agonizing scream as one in mortal anguish came
vibrating over the lake from some point down in
the southwestern corner dropping our fish wilson


amazing stories

and i ran oovvn the shore in the direction  the
cottages only to find all the women and a couple
of men huddled in a frightened group down by the
shore in reply to our queries one of the men said
chat the scream came from young barnaby who with
his father and mother occupied one of the cottages

  as it chanced no one had been out on the lake
except the young man all the other men with the
exception of the two who were on the shore when
we got there were in hampton laying in more sup-
plies when his mother called to young barnaby to
come in lie answered he would be back in a few
moments but for some unearthly reason had started
toward the deepening darkness of the western shore
the boys mother had remained on the cottage porch
following the lad with a mothers anxious eyes as he
paddled away into the shadows the two men also
watching from the shore commented upon the boys
whim

  up to this point there was perfect agreement
then started differences of opinion as to what fol-
lowed one man said he was certain the boy had
started to change ends in the canoe and had cap-
sized it in so doing his neighbor was equally cer-
tain that he had dimly seen the young man stand up
in the canoe and with the paddle strike at some-
thing and then suddenly pitch forward out of the
canoe screaming as he fell

  all this was told by the two men while the

   jlil four of us in two boats were racing toward
the spot where the boy was last seen

  although the man who declared the accident had
been due to the boys attempt to change ends still
stuck to his opinion i felt somehow that he was
wrong barnaby was i had been told a crack swim-
mer and considering that he must have been close
to shore when he fell into the water i was con-
vinced that merely being capsized would hardly have
elicited such a cry of agony no i felt abso-
lutely that there had been some sort of an attack
made upon him and that he had tried to fight off the
attacker whoever or whatever it was with his pad-
dle and that he had failed in the attempt and as
i tried to guess what sort of danger the unfortunate
boy had faced chills of horror went down my spine

  so thoroughly convinced was i that something
terrible had happened to barnaby and that he was
beyond help that the sight of his overturned canoe
as we drew near it acted only as a sickening con-
firmation yet knowing that it was useless i urged
a careful search and with the others called his name
again and again they may have hoped i did not
i merely knew the boy was dead

  i kept my thoughts to myself however since
voicing my suspicions would only make matters
worse it would be bad enough to believe her only
son had been drowned but i doubted whether her
reason would bear the shock of the awful thing i
had in mind wilson followed my example

  having no grappling irons we would not drag
the lake that night but i told mrs barnaby who
bore up remarkably well that i would get some from
hampton in the morning hampton had none so
we had to devise them from clumsily made heavy
rods and hooks

  young barnabys father wanted to go with us
but  prevailed upon him to remain with his wife

i felt it was lest because while i did not expect to
recover the body i realized the possibility of some-

thing very sinister and i felt it would be better for
him not to see what the irons might bring to the sur-
face maybe he sensed something of my thought
for he consented at last to remain behind

   we loaded the clumsy drag with the rope at-
 tached i had bought eight hundred feet in order
 fo make sure we had enough into the boat and with
 wilson at the oars pulled over to the place where the
 accident occurred we had some trouble getting the
 drag into the water owing to its awkward shape and
 weight but we finally succeeded in lowering it it
 seemed as if the drag would never reach bottom
 five hundred feet is a long way down

    when finally the drag came to rest i sat down
 in the stern of the boat and told wilson to row
 slowly he did he did even better than that he
 hardly moved at all i thought the drag might have
 caught on some snag but yvilson assured me there
 was no such thing in the whole area of the lake
 it required the combined efforts of eight men two
 to a boat to pull that thing

   we worked all day dragging every foot of the
 lake within a radius of several hundred yards from
 the spot where the boy went down we found noth-
 ing that day nor the next day nor any day within
 the week of heartbreaking labor

   it was labor lost but it was necessary there
 was no use running the risk of not only driving a
 mother and perhaps a father crazy but of ruining
 our business and of course i might have been
 mistaken

   the barnaby cottage was vacant the day after we
 ceased to drag the lake and it looked for a while
 as though the others might be too but after talking
 the matter over the occupants decided that it was
 only an accident sad indeed but only too common
 and since going back home would not help these
 parents to recover their boy they might just as well
 try to forget it so they stayed and the vacant cot-
 tage was soon rented again

   one thing however they didnt forget-that the
 accident happened in the evening so although the
 warm spell continued they kept off the lake after
 sundown

   nearly a month went by with no untoward hap-
 pening even those night noises ceased and i began
 to think i had let my imagination run wild and that
 young barnabys death had been due to a simple
 capsize of his canoe then there was another ac-
 cident and this time it was a particularly horrible
 one to add to its sinister aspects it took for its
 victims the young couple who occupied the cottage
 in which the barnaby family had lived

   the young man and his wife-their name was
 whipple-had been married only a little over a
 year mrs whipple a rather frail woman of the
 neurotic type temperamental crochety and stubborn
 as the devil was soon to become a mother and her
 condition of course didnt make her any easier to
 get along with she was a beauty though and
 whipple adored her

   but unreasonable as she was mrs whipple rea- 
 lized that she was in no condition to risk being tipped
 into the water even if she had been a good swimmer
 so she kept off the lake contenting herself with sit-
 ting in the bow of the boat which was tied to a
 stake driven into the ground a few feet from the
 edge there was absolutely no shore no beach and
 the water at the edge of the lake grew suddenly
 deep
the ancient horror



  no one will ever know what prompted her to
insist upon going out on the lake that night prob-
ably it was just an unaccountable whim common to
women had whipple been a little more coaxingly
diplomatic he might have talked her out of the no-
tion but unfortunately he emphatically negatived
her suggestion that he take her for a little boat ride
before they went to bed and the fat was in the fire
what had been when made just a simple wheedling
request became a demand backed up by evidence of
approaching hysterics

  according to holy writ which is accepted by
many people as being true eve succeeded in getting
adam to eat the apple even when he knew the con-
sequences were going to be disastrous so what could
be expected of a man so deeply in love with his wife
who only feared the possibility of an unpleasant re-
sult of his yielding whipple held out for a little
time but in the end she devilled him into taking her
and to make the matter worse she insisted upon
going straight across to the opposite shore and
back

  i was present at the time that is i was within
hearing distance having been engaged in conversa-
tion with the man next door to whipple when i
heard him grudgingly consent to take his wife
across i had a feeling of dread a premonition of
something dreadful in connection with it using all
the tact i possessed i tried to dissuade her from
going but it was useless she listened politely
enough for she was well brought up but she was
unshaken and what more could i do  true i might
have taken hold of the painter and refused to allow
whipple to take the boat as t had a hunch to do
but that would have necessitated an explanation
which i could hardly give so i contented myself
with saying that i wouldnt do it under the circum-
stances which helped not at all

  ive known people to laugh at a hunch they
claim there is nothing to it that the feeling is due
to some trifling nervous disorder entirely physi-
ological some attribute it to over-stimulation of
the nerves by alcohol or tobacco well perhaps it
is due to any one or all of these causes but ive
never known it to fail in my own case and ive had
plenty of chance to test it out the proof of course
is entirely one-sided for if i feel that ill be sorry
later if i do a certain thing and i obey that hunch
i never know that punishment would really have fol-
lowed had i disregarded the feeling it is like taking
the pasteur treatment for suspected rabies infection
if the treatment is taken before rabies develops in the
person it can never be known for certain that there
was any need for the treatment all that is known
is if there is an infection and the treatment is not
taken the person dies most horribly so with a
hunch it may be all bunk as the cold-blooded
matter-of-fact people claim but it doesnt cost much
to play the hunch and as a rule i do

f ft stood there on the shore watching the out-

  jl line of the boat grow dimmer and dimmer as it
neared the middle of the lake it was the second
night of the new moon the starless sky was like
black velvet and it seemed ominously still to me
at the first terrible ullulation of a woman in deadly
peril which came echoing across the black stretch of
water i felt not so much of surprise as confirmation
of a previous certainty none the less my very soul

sickened with dread and horror and when an instant
later the hoarser cry of a man smote my ears i
knew the tragedy was complete-both whipple and
his wife were past help

   i must have been very close to hysteria for when
 wilson whose teeth were chattering grasped my
 arm i shook him off with an oath and ran for the
 boat closely followed by the other men

   as a rule-i am not much bothered by nerves

 it is not due to any courage of an unusual sort for
 i have known fear many times but i certainly had
 them that night when we pulled across the lake
 toward the spot from which had come those terrible
 cries although i have crawled out into the mud and
 filth of no mans land in the blackness of a rainy
 night knowing that death would be my portion if i
 should betray my presence by a sound my nerves
 were steady although fear was in my heart i knew
 in what manner i should die and the knowledge
 helped but the awful mystery that lay behind the
 need for going out on the lake shook me and had
 any one touched me suddenly i am sure i should
 have screamed

   a hundred yards distant from the farther shore
we came upon the boat and drew alongside of it it
was empty suddenly my eye caught sight of some-
thing white at the bottom of the boat near the stern
pulling the craft along i reached for the object it
was a bit of muslin torn from a womans dress and
remembering that mrs whipple had been wearing a
white dress that night i turned sick

  when f lifted my hand from the gunwale of the
boat preparatory to beginning a search that i knew
would be fruitless i noticed that it felt sticky it
struck me as strange since the boat had not been
lately painted i was alxnit to dip my hand into the
lake to wash it when a thought struck me lighting
a match--for it was too dark to see anything clearly
-i looked to see what had befouled my hand

   it was blood

   wilson had been watching me and as i hastily
dipped my hand into the lake with a shudder i
could not prevent he asked in the tone of one who
dreads the answer was that- he didnt finish
- the question i nodded and i felt the boat quivver as
a spasm of shaking seized him

   we knew but we continued to search-we and the
others who had caught up with us although i was
ignorant as to what it was that had brought about
the death of three people i was certain there was
something sinister and terrible in that lake of ours
and i was afraid

   when we dragged the lake we found no bodies-
and i knew there would be nothing left to find

   this ended our enterprise one week after the
last accident found every cottage vacant and no
wonder not only were the women wrought up to
the breaking point over the affair itself but their
nights were made hideous by their dreams and the
infernal sound of that siren whistle or whatever
it was which grew increasingly worse it was a -
heartshaking sound

   after the last of our guests had packed up and
gone wilson and i determined to solve the mystery
for we were convinced there was a mystery hidden
somewhere in that lake

   fortunately for us nothing had been said con-
cerning the disappearance to arouse suspicion in
hampton it was known that some people had been


amazing stoiues

drowned which was of course unfortunate but not
unusual and we did not further enlighten them

   have no idea just what it was that suggested
a connection between the sounds that disturbed our
slumber and the happenings on the lake but i found
myself associating them in my mind wilson when
i mentioned it to him scoffed at the notion how
he asked could a noise tip a boat over and when
i tried to explain that the thing that made the noise
might be the cause he wanted to know how a loco-
motive could leave its rails and accomplish such a
thing you see he had accepted as fact the idea
that the sound we had been hearing emanated from
a mechanical contrivance  told him my idea of the
situation and i m inclined to believe that he thought
 had gone crazy for when i asked him to put in a
night with me trying to locate the noise he refused

  in deference to his opinion that the disturbance
could be traced to some engine i made it a point to
investigate the men were very courteous and
obliging and blew the whistles of engines that
traveled over that stretch of the companys right of
way but none of them gave forth the sound the
origin of which  was trying to discover

   i told wilson about my findings and when i told
him  was convinced the noise came from the lake
he consented to stand watch with me but i could
see that he took no stock in my belief

  for three nights we watched but heard nothing
and wilson was ready to drop the matter i had a
hard time getting him to go out the fourth night but
grudgingly he came with me

  since the noises seemed always to have come
from the southwestern shore and because it was
there the accidents had occurred we had used that
as our watching post unlike the eastern shore which
was open and fairly flat the western side dropped
sharply down to the water some of the trees their
footing broken away by the cave-in lay flat in the
water attached to the shore only by their roots their
branches obscuring considerably the nearer reaches
of the lake

  we found one tree which had rooted a little far-
ther back from the line of break had therefore part-
ly escaped the fate of its fellows held by its roots
it reached out over the water at an angle of some
twenty degrees it was a large conifer and its tough
branches with broken limbs placed across them af-
forded a safe and comfortable resting place although
being out over the lake and with nothing to break the
wind it was far from warm as i have said al-
ready the nights out there were cold

  there were no dangerous land animals about so
we carried no arms and i feel sure any arms we
might have taken would have been useless against
the creature we were hunting so with a packet
of lunch and a thermos bottle of hot coffee wilson
and  set out for our point of observation

  the night was clear when we started from the
house butafter an hour or so it began to thicken
and a mean cold drizzle set in we were warmly
dressed however so aside from the ordinary dis-
comfort of damp skin wherever it was exposed we
suffered none

  it was as nearly as i could judge i didnt think
of looking at my watch about half past ten oclock
when i was aroused from a half doze by an odd noise
that i could not for a moment classify it woke me
up however and now fully alert i waited for a

repetition of the sound i heard it again presently
and this time i recognized the sound it was a grunt
a regular hogs grunt if ii differed in any respect
from the familiar vocalizations one hears coming
from the pig-pens  didnt realize it at the moment
although it did seem to be an unusually healthy grunt

  my only feelings as i remember were those of
mild astonishment not so much because i had heard
the grunt of a hog which might have escaped from
its pen and wandered down to the lake but because
the sound came from the lake and not from the
land

fitniere is nothing in the sound of splashing
 water to scare one yet there by the lake
with the cold drizzle wetting my hands and face i
shivered when i heard that noise

  wilson his back against a crotched branch was
fairly asleep though he swore he wasnt and i was
in the act of waking him when like a blast from the
siren of an ocean liner the most awful roar i ever
heard tore through the night air from out there in
the darkness nearly shattering my ear-drums

  it fairly brought me to my feet and as for wil-
son if  had not been lucky enough to grab his coat
as he was disappearing downward through the
branches of the conifer what happened to him later
might have happened to him that night

  i had only just recovered from my mental balance
and got wilson back to safety when it came again
and i knew it was the same screaming noise we had
been hearing all the time and i knew also that that
noise was in some way responsible for the distressing
disappearances of our tenants and  knew that the
originator of that sound was of enormous size

  it would be difficult to adequately describe my
feelings as i sat crouched there upon our none too
secure platform peering out into the black darkness
trying to discover what manner of creature it was
that had given voice to that soul-shaking scream
fear i knew but there was something else beside
fear something of unrecognized dread perhaps a
premonition of some dreadful occurrence and when
the splashing sound came nearer i had to exercise
great self-control to keep from backing out of those
branches as quickly as possible and out of the neigh-
borhood and wilson i believe was even worse off
for his teeth were chattering and he seemed dumb
with fright

  then the splashing noise gave way to another
sound this time to a swishing sucking sound like
that made by an oar pulled forcibly through the
water whatever that thing was it was swimming
not like our ordinary animal swims-by moving its
legs-but rather after the manner of a seal-by pad-
dling with flippers and it was heading toward the
north end of the lake

  as the sound of its movements through the water
came from directly in front of us i dimly perceived
like a vague black shadow against a wall of black-
ness a vast undulating body i could not make out
its shape for there was not light enough but i knew
it was enormous and as i thought of it in connec-
tion with the terrible screams of those unfortunate
men and that helpless woman the muscles of my
throat tightened and-i am not ashamed to admit it
-tears filled my eyes wilson apparently had been
following the same line of thought lie was almost
un-nerved and sat there picking at his fingers and
the ancient horror



repeating over and over poor little woman poor
little woman when i could stand it no longer i
shook him and made him shut up

  when the last of the monsters shadow had
passed we painfully rose from our cramped posi-
tion and crawled back to shore and started for home
around the north end of the lake hoping to get an-
other and perhaps clearer view of the monster but
we didnt catch sight of it again perhaps it changed
its course or more likely had sought its hiding place

  i am not a drinking man but when we reached
the house and wilson poured a stiff peg of liquor
for himself i asked him to give me one too and
we needed that drink if ever any drink was needed
for we were pretty badly shaken up

  it was long past our usual bed hour but we didnt
feel very sleepy although probably from force of
habit i suggested turning in wilson however much
to my secret delight refused to take any chances of
dreaming about that thing no sir he said im
going to keep my clothes on and stay awake so
after another drink we filled our pipes and prepared
to wait for daylight

   what kind of a fish was that wilsons ques
tion aroused me from the train of thought into which
i had wandered and my mind engaged i replied an
aquatic antique this did not of course make things
any clearer for him so i asked if he knew anything
about the history of the earth and the strange crea-
tures that had lived upon it in ages long past his
knowledge was very limited so drawing on my mem-
ory of lessons learned years before t tried to answer
his query in such a manner as to enable him to under-
stand the probable meaning of what we had seen

  so far as repeating what i had read was con-
cerned my task was simple but any proper answer
that is one that would cover what we had dimly
glimpsed out there on the lake required something
more and i was obliged to resort to deductive rea-
soning in order to supply it

  briefly i told him that the age of the earth was
estimated to be between  and -

	years and that according to the age of the rocks
this great span of years was divided into ages such
as the azoic followed by the palaeozoic mesozoic
and cenozoic i told him that accepting the idea that
roughly  years represented the earths
age the mesozoic era lay back of us some -

	of years then i told him as well as i could
what sort of monsters and giant reptiles inhabited
the earth and its water at the time then in an effort
to account for the monster in the lake i drew upon
my imagination perhaps i guessed wrongly but

	know of no other way for there is no record
so far as i know of any creature except some of the
land species possibly that could equal in size the
thing whose shadow we had seen

  i am inclined to believe i was not far wrong be-
cause it is common geological knowledge that vast
continental changes were taking place at that remote
time and basing my conjecture upon that fact i told
him that during some of those tremendous upheavals
certain ones of the reptile family had probably been
caught in some of the great caverns that were formed
and unable to escape had adapted themselves to
their changed environment

  true it was that this thing was different from
any species known but is it certain that all the rep-
tiles that lived away back in those ages had been

classified  i wasnt at all certain that they had been
so this creature might be a direct descendant of some
distinct and unknown class or i thought it might
be possible that reptile might be some sort of
hybrid bearing a composite resemblance to its an-
cient forebears why not if you can crossbreed
asses and horses and get offspring which though
unmistakably different from either of its parents in
all essential features resembles both why could not
some similar sort of crossbreeding have occurred
with members of the reptile family

   all sorts of fossil remains of pre-historic reptiles
have been discovered in north america and those
creatures when alive lived here moreover amer-
ica it is known is fairly honeycombed with caverns
some of enormous extent many have water in them
although not sufficient perhaps to accommodate a
lizard as large as this particular one is it certain
that all the caverns have been discovered

  take this particular case for an example when
the bed of the reservoir caved in where did the water
go ifnot into some vast cavern or caverns and
had there not been such a cavern or caverns under
the bed of the creek would there have been any
cave-in of course not

  -following this line of deduction i came to the
conclusion that in the subterranean depths this rep-
tile with perhaps many others had been born and
since even a lizard cannot live in water that is en-
tirely stagnant inlets and outlets must have existed
to keep the water at least comparatively fresh

tiqpace alone is limitless so there must have

  obeen a limit to this cavern or caverns and
when the water broke through from above it was
filled to the point where the rock walls were burst
and the earth having lost its support fell forcing the
water upward and forming the lake when the water
reached a certain level or was on a plane with the
bed of the creek the reservoir filled up again under-
ground the outlet having been too small to carry
away the flow of the stream if my premise was cor-
rect then the presence of the lizard in our lake was
easily accounted for it simply came up through
the same hole through which the water came

  that was the explanation i gave wilson and i
thought and still think that it was correct

  after breakfast i went to the north end of the
lake i believed i had hit upon the real solution
of the reptiles presence in the lake and wanted to
verify it if possible i had an idea that the lizard
might take it into its head to come up from below
and give me a chance to see it i wanted wilson to
accompany me but he said he had too much work
to do about the place

  i waited near the hole until about noon but
seeing no sign of it i concluded that it had either
come up early or what was more likely was hiding
down there in the darkness until nightfall instead
of turning homeward however i decided to settle
another question for some time now we had seen -
no trout jumping and i thought they might have
been frightened out of the lake and returned to the
reservoir wilson and i although we did not know
until the night before just what had caused the ac-
cidents thought it better to go without fish than to
take any risks out on the lake but if they were in
the reservoir again i meant to catch a few

  the knoll or mound about which i told you in


amazing stories

ilie beginning lay directly between me and the reser-
voir and since it was easy to climb  started up its
side it was covered with low brush and weeds that
hid the surface of the ground from view but did
not greatly impede my progress i plowed my way
to the top and started across the rounded back to-
ward the reservoir i had gone only a few paces
when without warning the ground gave way beneath
my feet and  soon found myself in a heap in the
gravel at the bottom of what seemed to me to be
an over-sized cistern

   was not injured but i was considerably shaken
up for  had fallen about ten feet for a moment
 was inclined to laugh at myself for i cut a funny
figure sitting there hunched up but there was noth-
ing to laugh at  found myself in a serious position
for i was imprisoned at the bottom of a hole sur-
rounded by unscalable walls of loose gravel more-
over no one had seen me at or near this isolated
place so unless a miracle happened no one ever
would come in time to find me alive well sitting
there staring at the opening through which i had
fallen woulddo no good so i began to take my sur-
roundings into serious consideration

  it soon became evident that the hole had been
dug by some one for a definite purpose what that
purpose was i had no idea the opening at the top
i discovered had been covered with planks which in
the course of a short time had become covered with
earth and vegetable matter in turn this furnished
soil in which had grown the weeds that hid the spot
none of the boards had fallen into the hole nor was
there anything i could use to enable me to reach the
opening as there was nothing else i could do i
decided to kick gravel from the walls and heap it up
until the pile was high enough to enable me to reach
beyond the broken boards grasp some bush or other
thing and get out

  i knew i had a tedious job ahead for i had only
my hands to use as a shovel at one side of the
hole quite a pile of gravel load fallen of its own
weight which gave me a good start i thought
throwing double handfuls into the center of the
floor soon proved to be a bad job my hat also
proved too slow a method so i spread my coat filled
it then carried it over to the slowly growing mound
on which i dumped these accumulations

  i had a heap about three feet high when in
scooping up another double handful my fingers came
in contact with the surface of a box i soon had it
uncovered fully and found it to be about a foot deep
fifteen inches wide and about two feet long i was
about to kick the cover off in order to find out what
if anything it contained when i was moved to ex-
amine it a little more closely first it was a good
thing i obeyed the impulse because after carefully
prying off the cover which had begun to show signs
of dry rot i discovered a two gallon cannister of
nitro-glvcerine

  the reason for the hole became apparent at once
it had been used as a chamber for explosives while
the reservoir was in process of construction and this
box very likely had been overlooked when the work
was finished

  very carefully i carried it over and laid it on its
side on top of the little heap of gravel digging
further i found another box and another until i
had found fifteen i piled these pyramid fashion
under the hole through which i had fallen then

holding my breath and taking care not to make a
false step  climbed to the top and soon found my-
self in the sunshine once more where  could breathe
freely

sfti then i reached the reservoir i found the
vv trout jumping the fish problem settled i
started back toward the house for my tackle i was
about half the way to the fence when i saw wilson a
long stick in his hand trying to head off a cow that
had broken from the corral and was now headed for
the lake

  mules are supposed to be and are stubborn but
when it comes to downright orneryness i think a
cow is pretty much of a fool added to this cows
are nervous things ready to stampede at a moments
notice and when they get a notion into their heads
you cant club it out

  now this cow was a holstein and valuable so
when wilson saw her heading for the lake he very
naturally objected considering the sort of tenant
that lake harbored

  i was too far away to be of assistance and the
beast was too much for him alone dodging past his
swinging club she drove head on for the water her
tail so it seemed flapping in derision she was still
on the gallop when she reached the water so she
went entirely under i saw her come up a few yards
from the bank and cow-wise start for the farther
shore i dont know why a cow will always under
similar circumstances make for the farthest point
unless it is because as i said they are just plain
fools

  in his anxiety over his cow wilson forgot some-
thing he should have remembered if the lake was a
dangerous place for the holstein it was even more
dangerous for him but he may never have thought
about the lizard at all at any rate he ran to the
little dock that projected out into the water and
getting into the boat that was tied there began to
row frantically after old bossy

  i was too far away to warn him of his danger
although it didnt actually seem great then the lake
like a great blue gem bathed in the golden rays of the
afternoon sun suggested nothing further than
dimpled beauty made somewhat sinister by the
knowledge that deep down in its sapphire depth there
had been and might at the moment be a nameless
and monstrous horror i guess i have become a bit
of a fatalist it seems to me things are pretty much
laid out for us from the beginning we are sup-
posed to be free moral agents according to the
clergy yet i wonder if we really are of course
wilson did not have to go out on the lake nor
would he have gone if he had stopped to think but
blame can hardly be attached to him for not stopping
to think he never did

  by the time i reached the spot where the cow
went into the water the animal was about a hundred
yards from shore headed back for wilson had over-
taken her and made her turn back there wasnt a
thing to be nervous about so far as appearances
went but i was worried and i urged him to hurry
he waved his hand and nodded and that was the
last thing he ever did his hand had barely grasped
the oar again when silently from the blue depths
there came into view just behind wilson the awful
head and neck of the creature whose shadow we had
dimly seen that night when we sat crouched on a
the ancient horror



shaky platform spread over the branches of the fal-
len conifer

  up it rose to a height of seven or eight feet
while i gazing upon its utter frightfulness stood
paralyzed and dumb i saw its cavernous mouth
fully three feet from snout to the angle of the jaw
saw it open and reveal its gleaming needle sharp
teeth over the head of the unfortunate man and i
was utterly helpless if my own life had been at
stake i could not have uttered a cry of warning

  i think wilson must have sensed something
somehow for i noticed i can see that look even
now a look of fear spread over his rugged features
but it was too late for just as he was in the act of
turning his head to see what was behind him the
end came there was a slight working of the ter-
rible jaws perhaps due to some sort of gustatory sug-
gestion of the things instinctive machinery then like
a flash down came the obscene head the jaws closed
with a snap and wilson only his legs protruding be-
yond the lizzards snout was snatched from his seat
with the speed and ease with which a hen picks up
a kernel of corn

  horror unspeakable overpowered my mind and
i think i lost consciousness for a moment maybe i
went mad for a time for i have no remembrance of
having gone to the house nor until awakened by a
terrific crash of thunder did i have a realization that
anything had taken place

  when i regained my senses i sat slumped over
in one of the kitchen chairs i felt dazed like one
who has been on a long drunk shadows of strange
memories passed through my mind suggesting noth-
ing definite then another frightful crash swept the
cob-webs from my brain and  felt memory coming
back with a rush

  other things came quickly and perhaps for-
tunately to occupy my mind and demand my atten-
tion for one of the worst storms i had ever wit-
nessed was brewing fast and furiously the house
stout though it was trembled and creaked beneath
the onslaught of the elements gone wild

  getting up from the chair i staggered to the win-
dow the sky was overcast with heavy clouds those
immediately overhead being a grayish black while
down in the southwest an unearthly greenish mass
of whirling cumuli writhed and twisted high up in
the heavens that there were several currents of
air coming from as many different directions was
evident from the manner in which the tops of the
trees behaved they fairly threshed about pres-
ently the temperature began to drop and great clouds
from the northwest drove- past beneath the blackness
far overhead and then the flashes of lightning be-
came appalling as the fire forks darted from cloud
to cloud while deafening peals of thunder sent every
loose thing a-rattle

  then the rain came came in torrents that were
veritable cascades of driven water beating in at every
crack and crevice there was a blinding flash a
hundred yards from the house and a tall tree
splintered into kindling flew in all directions this
the gale whirled and tossed about finally driving it
into the lake the surface of which was beaten into
froth

  i heard a crash overhead and knew the chimney
had gone by the board this was followed by a rip-
ping sound and the roof of the chicken house look-
ing like the flapping wings of some enormous bird
went sailing away across the lake and when the

house itself began to slide upon its foundation i
expected it to follow it did not however neither
did it lose its roof although as i discovered later
there wasnt a whole shingle left on it

  suddenly the hideous racket was augmented by a
sound that over-rode all other noises every win-
dow pane was shattered every door was driven from
its hinges while through the openings a deluge of
water rushed flooded the house and knocked me
into a corner

  i have heard about the crack of doom many
times and if it is going to be any worse than that
crack i dont want to hear it however it seemed
to serve one useful purpose for after it came the
awful racket began to subside and within the hour
only an occasional rumble bore evidence of energy
still at work the rain continued however until it
seemed the oceans were being drained to furnish the
water

  wet cold and weary i waded through the water
that swashed back and forth through the lower
rooms to the stair leading to the second floor i
dragged my aching body up the stairs down which
little streams trickled for the windows upstairs
also were shattered i went from room to room
seeking some place of shelter out of the wind where
i might perhaps find some dry clothing and lie down
the second floor was pretty well soaked but i found
shelter at last in a large closet in the rear this
part of the house was toward the east and since the
storm had come from the southwest and north it was
comparatively dry there in this closet i found wil-
sons sunday suit some shirts and a pair of shoes
together with a few pairs of socks the suit was
too small and the shoes too large but i was in no
position to be particular so i put them on unless
you have been in a similar predicament you cannot
know the comfort of dry clothing of any kind or
make

  after wringing out my own clothes and hanging
them over the backs of chairs to dry if the rain ever
let up i piled some things on the floor and upon
these for a bed i soon forgot all about the storm
and what had gone before it

  a ray of sunlight on my eyes reflected from a
mirror awoke me my watch had stopped so i
didnt know just what time it was although i judge
it must have been about nine oclock i was a bit
stiff and hungry but otherwise in pretty good shape
after drawing the chairs over which my clothes
hung into the sunshine i went down stairs dug the
wet ashes out of the stove made a fire and cooked
some ham and eggs and coffee for myself then
i started out to learn the extent of the damage

  there was plenty the roof of the barn had
fallen in driving the walls outward luckily the
weather had been warm so the cattle were still kept
outside i found them at last in a small apple
orchard apparently no worse for having been out
in the storm contentedly eating grass i say had
been because practically every one of the trees had
been ruined the branches having been torn off

  then for no particular reason i strolled down
to the lake except for a lot of floating shingles
branches and boards it was the same smiling beau-
tiful blue body of water-the last place in the world
i thought where such terrible tragedies could take
place and the most unlikely hiding place for the
horror that had caused the events soon i became
aware of a muffled sound like a rushing of water


amazing stories 

over a fall and wondered what caused it a little
later i noticed that the floatsani was drifting toward
the north end of the lake this was odd since there
was no current and curious to learn why i started
in the same direction soon the muffled sound be-
came louder it was coming from the lake puzzled
for a moment like a flash the explanation came to
me and i started north on the run

  i soon reached the place where the noise came
from-a great rent at the end of the basin in which
the lake lay i looked toward the mound or rather
toward the place where the mound had been for it
was there  longer and if i had been in doubt as
to what had caused the rent i was soon in possession
of full knowledge that unearthly crash had been
caused by the explosion of those fifteen cases of
nitro-glycerine and there may have been more buried
in the sand when a streak of lightning found its way
into the pit in which they were

  the rocky floor of the pit must have been a sort
of pot cover over the subterranean cavern or
caverns and the force of the explosion had torn it
away rending the rocks and earth into a great tear
extending through the wall which held the lake it
had done even more it tore out the wall between it
and the reservoir for i found upon going around
the chasm to the dam that the water was rapidly
lowering while i stood there amazed at the force
of the charge a large block of concrete from the
end of the dam nearest me broke loose and fell with
a splash into water evidently i thought the whole
dam was being undermined and was liable at any
moment to fall i made haste to get away from the
place and i acted wisely for within ten minutes the
whole enormous structure of concrete crumbled and
fell a part of it going completely out of sight in the
hole in the bed of the reservoir while the rest went
in the opposite direction

  it was apparent since the chasm was enlarging
momentarily that it would not take long to empty
both reservoir and lake and being minded to see the
finish i went back to a point of safety on the east-
ern shore sat down  a rock and waited for the end

ffqitting there wondering into what profound

  o	depths the waters of the lake and reservoir
were plunging speculating upon the possible truth
of some tales i had read concerning people discovered
living in a world beneath a world i forgot for a
time what was taking place before my eyes

  i was aroused from my reverie by a snort and
coming back to actualities i looked to see what had
produced it there was the great lizard from whose
throat it had emanated not fifty yards before me

  at last i saw the monster and monster it truly
was my powers of description are far too limited
to adequately describe that monster its body at
least the upper part was fully exposed swan-like
in shape it appeared to be nearly sixty feet from
the point where the neck joined the body to the end
of its tail which resembled in a way the tail of a
duck this body armed or equipped with flappers
similar to those of a seal but enormously larger was
a greenish black and was covered with what might
have been the slime and ooze of ages its neck
flexible as that of the swan was fully two feet in
diameter at its base tapering slowly to the head
eight feet from the body the head was a com-

posite of the crocodile and the tyrannosaurus but
much larger with loosely articulated jaws permit-
ting of tremendous extension as is the case with
certain snakes the mouth armed with teeth fully
six inches in length was at least three feet long from
the snout to the angle of the jaws to add to its
frightfulness the upper canine teeth or fangs
curved outward and downward over the lower jaw
and were as near as i could judge at least ten
inches long a more horrible creature i couldnt
imagine and i wondered whether it might be a
member of some species that had never been cata-
logued or whether it was what it appeared to be
a hybrid i think it was the latter and since it was
the only one that had come into the light of modern
times i also wondered if the thing could have begun
its existence away back there in the mesozoic era
it seemed impossible and yet who knows at any
rate it certainly looked ancient enough to have been
born long before creation began doubtless i
thought there were others like it somewhere for
it seemed unlikely that only one specimen would have
been caught in one of the cataclysms of those an-
cient days but whether or not i was right can
never be told

  apparently the lizard was terrified at something
probably at the idea of being sucked into the chasm
into which the water was pouring for it was mak-
ing violent efforts to draw away from that end of
the lake it was a losing game however for the
suck of the water powerful as was the reptile was
too strong and thresh the water as it might and did
it was slowly being drawn back whatever else
might be said of the lizard it was no coward for
realizing the fact that it was a losing game it sud-
denly turned and with a terrific bellow using its
flippers to accentuate its speed in a sort of devil
daring spurt it drove head-long into the vortex

  during the day the waters continued to enlarge
the chasm and by night the lake had nearly vanished
as had also the reservoir

  the following morning the city engineers were
out and as well as i could i explained what had hap-
pened as it chanced i did most of my talking to
the man who had supervised the construction of the
reservoir and was therefore the only one who knew
about the nitro-glycerine i realized that my knowl-
edge of its presence in the pit caused him some
worry and he explained that he had given orders for
its removal but they evidently had been forgotten
or disregarded by the workmen so i told him i would
not mention the matter to anyone for which he
seemed very grateful since it could have done 
good to tell about it then i deemed it best to forget
about the matter

  but i mentioned the lizard to  one i ex-
plained the disappearance of wilson by telling them
that he had fallen into the lake from a rowboat
while trying to drive back to the shore a cow that
had gone into the water that also was the story i 
told the lawyers who settled up the estate

  as soon as possible i gathered up my traps and
came back to the city i have tried to forget the
experience for it was far from pleasant but this
story in the paper brought it up again and i repeat

i shall not be surprised to read that those men have
found some hold-over from the mesozoic era for i
believe there are specimens still alive why not

by charles s wolfe

a master key for a boh fenner said quietly a nicc little electro magnet and some lamp cord

                                           the lamp socket and shoot the bolts about at will

simple wasnt it hook right into

followed fenner through the door
of davidsons office we found the
worthy chief of police seated behind his
desk from which vantage point he
greeted us with an unusually cheerful
good morning

  he seemed in rare good humor and i noted the
quizzical uplifting of fen-
ners eyebrows as he ad-
vanced to the desk and
leaned lazily against it

  we received your mes-
sage chief drawled fen-
ner and we came right
down what have we now
-murder mayhem lar-
ceny or abduction

  davidson laughed out-
right involuntarily i
started it was the first
time that  had heard a laugh out of the usually taci-
turn chief in fact  firmlv believed that the very
farthest he would ever get in that direction would
be a broad grin and i realized that something un-
usually humorous must have come up to betray the
police head into open mirth

  none of the bunch you so glibly named joe
chuckled davidson in fact we have nothing every-
thing is going nicely  dont need you at all but
ive got a bird in my private office there who needs
you badly ill say he docs oh boy wait till you
hear his story

  sounds interesting admitted fenner what
is it usually obedient
daughter eloped with the
family chauffeur-some-
thing of that sort

  davidson rose come
on into the office and let
him tell you the story him-
he said over his
shoulder as he led the
way and with curiosity
aroused we followed after
him into the next room
seated at the table was
a well dressed young man whose face bore no trace
of the mirth that seemed to have gotten the best
of davidson as we entered he glanced up quickly
and i imagined i saw the shadow of disappoint-
ment cross his features as davidson introduced
fenner

 rljh cleverness of this story like the cleverness of
 a great many things lies largely in its simplicity
 the shooting of bolts whether for opening or closing
 a door involves an impenetrable mystery until it is eluci-
 dated by so simple a solution that we must zvondcr it
 did not occur to everybody on the first reading of the
 story read the story and see zvhut the master key
 was and see how surprised you will be at the simplicity
 of it all you will even find a mr watson in this
 story-not the one of sherlock holmes fame hozvevcr




amazing stories

  meet mr fenner and his friend said david-
son joe this is mr watson son of john watson
who has the ice plant fenner here mr watson is
the man i think you want tell him your story
youll excuse me for im rather busy this morning
davidson left us and as we seated ourselves
across the table from watson i began studying him
covertly for he was a well-known figure around our
town son of one of the wealthiest of our citizens
he was prominent in all the big social activities of
the upper set and a member of all the exclusive
clubs his name was constantly appearing in the
public prints and i made the most of this oppor-
tunity to get a line on the man

  he spoke in low cultured tones not looking di-
rectly at us and toying with a paper knife in a
nervous fashion as he talked

  i find myself in a most embarrassing situation
mr fenner he said and davidson tells me that
he is unable to give me any assistance because the
matter cannot be considered as legitimately in his
line i suppose hes right also i admit that i
am showing poor sportsmanship in asking aid in
this business but you will understand that it is
not the money involved that leads me to unfair play
i am in a fair way to become the laughing stock
of the city and at all costs this must be prevented
and what is the difficulty mr watson fenner
asked politely as the clubman paused

  it is a silly bet that i was foolish enough to
make at the lynx club with young fair yesterday
afternoon we were discussing some of the popular
books of the day and finally worked around to a
detective story which is having quite a run maybe
youve read the thing-chap is murdered in a room
to which there is no apparent ingress possible with-
out detection-that sort of stuff i remarked that
all this kind of business was drivel-that in every-
day life such things could not and did not take
place young fair with all the romanticism of
youth defended the writer and his clan said that
things occur in reality that outdo the marvelous
happenings of fiction the dispute grew rather
hotter than either of us liked and-well we ended
in a bet

  fair offered to bet me five thousand dollars that
he personally could demonstrate to a selected com-
mittee that the mysterious entrance or exit from
a room as described in this book was quite possible
i accepted the wager

  the committee was selected and the conditions
agreed on he was to enter a room from which no
unaided exit could apparently be made he was
to be allowed the entire night in which to effect
his escape if he succeeded i agreed to find him
within  hours and to explain how he got away
or forfeit the wager

  the arrangements were made and he entered
the chosen room at eight last evening this morn-
ing we forced an entrance to that room he has
disappeared

  fenner made no effort to conceal his grin put
one over eh any idea how he managed it
not the slightest confessed watson dejectedly
apparently it is impossible yet he is gone mv
forty-eight hours are slipping away rapidly and it
seems as if i am slated to lose i dont regard the
money at all you will understand i would give the
little devil that much if he asked for it it is the

idea of having the young jackanapod hoodwink me
in this fashion that makes me determined to find
him if i can yet i havent any idea where to
begin now  am making you this offer solve this
riddle for me and the money i win you may have
of course i rely on you to keep secret the fact
that you aided me

  thats a pretty stiff condition objected fen-
ner for how i am to get a look at the scene of
this mysterious disappearance without someone not-
ing my presence there and how i am to trace the
movements of fair without following any trail he
may have left without seeing it is more than i can
imagine

  that you can easily do returned watson the
selected room was in the commercial house this
morning we forced the door doing some little dam-
age i told the proprietor that i would send work-
men around to make the necessary repairs you
may represent yourselves as locksmiths without
arousing any suspicion

  right fenner agreed cheerfully and now
mr watson give me a concise account of fairs last
movements

  we finally chose a room on the twelfth floor
fair accepted this room without comment and it
suited me it opens into a long corridor which
leads to the elevator it is much like the other
rooms on that floor the reason that it appealed
to me was that it was situated quite a distance from
the fire-escape in fact it is inconceivable that fair
passed out through the windows of the rooms
granting that he had nerve to venture out over
the abyss couldnt he reach the roof  queried fen-
ner quietly

  watson shook his head in negation three stor-
ies above is the out-jutting cornice- you know prac-
tically no hand or foothold on the surface of the
wall i dont imagine a cat could make it i think
we can eliminate the windows the hotel proprietor
assures me that there are no secret passages spaces
between the walls or anything of that sort in the
building i take his word for it now as to the
doors there are two the one leading into the
room from the corridor by which fair entered and
one within the room in the left wall leading into an
adjoining room which also has a door opening into
the corridor

  both these doors have ordinary locks not dead
latches for this reason i suppose they have also
bolts there is a bolt on the inside of the door
which opens on the corridor and a bolt on the door
within the room there is a bolt on the other side
of that door by the way within the adjoining room
i looked this morning and for the occasion we
put a bolt on the outside of the corridor door

  when fair entered the room we shot this out-
side bolt he shot the one on the inside thats why
we had to force our way in this morning that bolt
on the inside was still in place so also were both
bolts on the other door and there you are
fenner arose your description of the condi-
tions is good mr watson he said and now bill
and i will become locksmiths and go down and see if
we can do anything for you if t am able to help
you out ill call davidson on the phone

  do that agreed watson and remember the
money is all yours if you can successfully unravel
this mystery
the master key



  fenner nodded and we passed out leaving wat-
son seated at the table as we passed through the
outer office davidson favored us with a wink and
a grimace to which fenner replied by forming with
his hands a very creditable imitation of the long
ears of a mule

  we made our way to fenners house attired our-
selves in working clothes took a few- tools and
caught a downtown car as we rode i ventured to
question fenner hoping that he might have a pos-
sible solution to the riddle he proved non-com-
mittal

   wait bill he said until we have had a first-
hand look at the scene of this fourth-dimensional
chaps activities let us form no theories until we
know all that is to be known about the case

   watsons description was quite lucid i replied
and if things are just as he described them the
trick seems impossible to me fair couldnt have
flown you know

  no matter how impossible it may seem rejoined
fenner you are face to face with the fact that
when they broke into the room this morning fair
was gone that i take it is proof enough that it is
quite possible here we are

  on stating our errand to the manager we had
no trouble in securing admission to the room and
the departing bell-hop left us alone in the room from
which fair had contrived to find an exit

  the damage to the door was trivial and fenner
set about making the few necessary repairs you
search carefully bill he said as he applied him-
self to the task of replacing the torn off bolt and
its keeper and make sure that our young friend is
not here disguised as a bed or a clothes tree
ignoring the banter i did make a thorough ex-
amination of the room having come to the conclu-
sion  the way down that fair might just possibly
have remained in the room avoiding detection by
some clever expedient

  my efforts were fruitless however for a search
convinced me that he could not possibly be in hiding
within the room

  conditions were just as described bv watson
there was no disorder or sign of unusual physical
effort to suggest a possible answer to the enigma
a glance out of the window assured me that watson
had spoken the truth just to fancy a human being
clinging to the surface of that wall at that height
was sickening and i felt convinced that fair had
not made the fire-escape yet the bolted doors
seemed proof that he had not passed through either
of them for it is possible to lock a door after you
but hardly so to shoot a bolt inside of a closed
door also the fact that there w-ere bolts on the out-
side of each of these doors made it look like a rather
difficult proposition for him to have opened them at
all let alone having bolted them behind him

  the ceiling examined from the vantage point of a
chair was as fruitless of clues as the previously
scrutinized floor

and now said fenner after these details had
been attended to we will take a leaf from wat-
sons book and have a look at the adjoining room
bv means of an ordinary skeleton key we readily
got into this chamber through the corridor door i

prepared myself for another thorough search but
fenner stayed me no use bill he said lets
go

  mystified and a little rebellious i followed him
from the room and we made our way to the street

  as we walked along fenner hummed softly under
his breath

  it wouldnt have done any harm to have taken a
look around that room i grumbled on the off
chance while hes not likely there we might have
made sure

  nor would it have done us any good ah
theres a telephone booth wait here until i get
davidson and kiss that five thousand good-bye

  are you giving it up i demanded amazed and
hurt lets go back and have another try

  not on your life said fenner grimly lead
us not into temptation if i go back there i may be
tempted to collect that money

  youll never collect it this way i demurred
my boy i dont want to collect it retorted fen-
ner i dont need money that badly watsons a
short sport or he would have seen this thing through
himself and not asked to buy the brains which he
apparently lacks fair on the other hand has proved
himself the possessor of some real gray matter get
me im going to be something of a good sport
myself and not give him away

  i laughed shortly give him away i echoed

i hardly think you will

  fenner stopped short in his tracks nettled say
you ass he said sharply you dont think im -
stumped do you let me tell you something fel-
low i know where that lad is at this very moment
you do i yelled then where in blazes is
he

  in that room thati wouldnt let you search my
bov rejoined fenner complacently gratified by
my startled expression thats why i literally
dragged you out i didnt want you to flush the poor
lad and spoil it for him he was in that big closet
sticking out his forty-eight hours

  he was i demanded in amazement how
did he get through that bolted door

  easiest thing in the world chuckled fenner
a cinch he had the master key

  a master key for a bolt t demanded incred-
ulously

  a master key for a bolt fenner said quietly
a nice lit lie electro-magnet and some lamp cord
simple wasnt it hook right into the lamp socket
and shoot the bolts about at will he figured and
rightly enough that the fact that all those bolts
were found safely in their keepers would ward off all
suspicion that he merely stepped into the adjoining
room he was right when he told watson that
things happen in every day life that are stranger
than fiction maybe that worthy will believe him
now

  good night i murmured dazedly i never 
thought of that method-never suspected the trick
i did replied fenner and just the moment
that i saw those bolts were of steel and not
brass i knew that t was right gee couldnt we
have rigged up some station with those five thou-
sand iron men

the return of the martians



chapter i

ittle did i dream when i penned the
account of dr hargraves epoch-making
discovery under the title of the re-
treat to mars which appeared in the
august issue of this publication that
even more astounding events were to take place
within a few short months

  soon after i had forwarded the narrative to the
editor i received a telegram from washington
signed by hargraves asking me to come at the earli-
est possible moment naturally it was not long
before i was on my way in response to his request
for i knew that my friend would not call me away
from my work without good reasons moreover my
expenses were to be paid and that appealed to my
scottish blood

  hargraves met me at the depot on my arrival in
washington and whisked me away to his apartment
at once no mention other than that it was some-
thing big was made of the cause of his telegram
until i was comfortably settled in his study after a
good hot shower and a general clean-up necessi-
tated by my journey 

  when we were snugly ensconsed in front of a
comfortable open fire my host took a pile of fools-
cap and drawings from a side table and laying them
on his knee he leaned back in his chair and began

  i have here a translation of one of the volumes
contained in the library and need the assistance of a
psychologist and an astronomer to work out de-
tails of tlie apparatus described here and afterwards
in the operation thereof it is nothing less than a
signaling apparatus with which we can get into com-
munication with the martians-that is if they are
still there he added it is really a type of radio
transmitter but to me it appears to be totally new
in principle knowing that you are a radio enthusi-
ast and that you have done much work on the sub-
ject i secured permission to get you to oversee the
construction of the apparatus and assist me in get-
ting in touch with the martians there are many
men in washington who would be glad to give an
arm for the opportunity i offer you but many of
the secrets disclosed in the
transcribed library are to
become government prop-
erty and you will see
there are some that will
be of inestimable value to
the country holding them

for this reason we prefer
to call in one who has
already proved himself
trustworthy if you ac-
cept the appointment and
pledge yourself to secrecy all the information that
you need will be placed at your disposal the neces-
sary money for the experiment will be granted with-
out demur although we have made but the roughest
estimate of the cost as yet you will be granted a
salary which i think will be satisfactory to you
while you are engaged in the work will you accept
the appointment 

  i should say i will accept i exclaimed it is
no use my telling you how delighted i am that you
should have given me this opportunity there is a
young chap just coming along and attending uni-
versity wlio will be only too glad to carry on in my

absence i will get him to take over my share of
the observing while  am away

  we will settle things tomorrow then said har-
graves i will take you over to see the chief
who will make all the necessary arrangements you
can go over this translation and the diagrams which
i have had copied this evening after dinner-its
nearly time for that now like to take a glance at
the drawings before going in

  i took the proffered papers and glanced at the
diagrams as dr  largraves had intimated the
ideas were new to us though it would be classed
as a radio transmitter it was totally different to any-
thing i had ever seen before gone were the famil-
iar valves and oscillating circuits they were replaced
by purely mechanical methods of setting up the ether
disturbances the instrument was directional send-
ing out a beam that deviated from parallelism by an
extremely small amount hence the output of the
arrangement was conserved necessitating but a mi-
nute fraction of the power that would be required to
operate even the most efficient of our beam trans-
mitters

  during dinner we discussed the probability of our
signals being heard according to hargraves the
martians had erected permanent receivers at various
points on the planet connected with an alarm and
recording system so that as soon as the earth re-
plied to the long-delayed message the inhabitants
of the other planet would know that we had at last
found their gift to us they had promised that
the receivers would remain in place and in order as
long as there was the slightest chance that the earth
would reply

  at-the conclusion of the meal we again repaired
to the doctors study and there i read the instructions
for making the receiver and the transmitter with
all the facilities that were to be placed at my dis-
posal t knew that it would not be long before the
first signal would be directed towards its goal i
could not understand the fundamental principles on
which the operation of the apparatus was based but
from references given in the text i learned that 
would find them elucidated in another volume har-
graves promised to have this translated for me
immediately

  the following morning
i was introduced to dr
smythe the head of the
department under which i
was to work and arrange-
ments were quickly made
that were satisfactory to
all concerned with three
assistants i set to work
without losing any time
and in a few days the in-
struments were well under way the work was
carefully apportioned among the three men so that
no clue as to the exact nature of the apparatus they
were constructing could be obtained by any one of
them and the secrets of the instruments could not
leak out as it came to me part by part i carefully
checked them over from the original specifications
and assembled them into the components of the fin-
ished transmitter gradually i began to understand
the exact nature of the power used and as i studied
the works referred to in the text of the instructions
t learned how to adjust and operate the apparatus
when in operation

 jtiiose of our readers who have read the retreat
 - to mars will be interested in the present story
 which is a sequel thereto mr white the author who
 is an astronomer is so well informed about this subject
 that zee read with bated breath his most unusual as
 well as powerfully written story many things are
 brought out here which very likely the average reader
 never realizes yet the story is not technical at all on
 the contrary it will hold the interest of practically every
 reader no matter what his inclinations may be


amazing stories

  as soon as the transmitter was completely assem-
bled hargraves and i left washington for the west
coast where my observatory is located to install
test and adjust it a powerful telescope was needed
to direct the beam of the transmitter to the far dis-
tant receivers and the necessary instructions for its
construction and its operation were given we had
advanced more than far enough to take care of this
part of the work ourselves so these instructions
were only read in a cursory manner though they
contained several new and far-reaching ideas that
would repay later study it was unnecessary to
construct an instrument specially for this work as
the one i owned in my observatory was powerful
enough and with the slight modifications we were
able to make we could use it in conjunction vyith the
transmitter the receiver lacked a few minor parts
when we left washington and these were to be
forwarded to us as soon as they were finished

  the projector was connected to the telescope in
due course all other work being suspended and was
adjusted so that the axis of projection was parallel
to the optical axis of the telescope this adjustment
was very delicate for as i mentioned before the
beam was practically non-divergent and as the area
it would cover on the planets surface would subtend
a solid angle of but four seconds of arc the greatest
care had to be taken in making this adjustment we
had also to ascertain the effects of flexure of the
telescope tube in different positions and to make a
table of the necessary corrections to be applied to
eliminate this error in setting

  through some misunderstanding the parts for
the receiver had not arrived by the time we were
ready to make our first attempt to communicate with
mars nevertheless we decided to make an attempt
at letting our neighbors know that we were at last
ready to communicate with them

  anxiously we watched the sky the afternoon be-
fore the actual test took place but it was cloudless
and there was every indication of a good night
i checked up my computations carefully so that i
was sure that there were no mistakes in the position
of the points to which the telescope had to be directed
in order that the signals might reach the martian
receivers it was necessary of course to direct
the beam to a point where the receiver would be
when the signals reached the planet-the velocity of
the radio waves being finite three factors had to
be taken into consideration on directing the beam
the first was that the planet was not where we
observed it to be for due to the finite velocity of
light the planet was somewhat ahead of the point
where it was observed the amount depending upon
the relative positions and distances of the earth and
mars in their orbits then again the time that the
signals would take to reach the planet had to be
taken into consideration the second correction was
due to the refraction a beam of light suffers on enter-
ing our atmosphere except when coming vertically
downward this phenomenon making an object ap-
pear higher in the heavens than it really is the
third factor has already been mentioned that due
to the flexure of the telescope tube

  two oclock found the planet high enough in the
southeast to warrant the attempt the seeing was
fair and with a power of six-hundred it was not
difficult to set on the computed position hargraves
pressed a key of the twelve-keyed keyboard used
and a single long dash was sent on its way hurtling

with the speed of light towards its goal 
miles away

  the martian code is difficult to describe without
entering into it fully it was sent with the aid of
twelve keys each key altering the characteristic form
of the carrier-wave the keys could be pressed
in combinations with the result that a competent
operator could send a message almost as fast as
speech hargraves had become quite an adept with
it and i had made a little progress but not enough
to transmit well that was left to my companion

  following a series of calling dashes hargraves
sent off the following communication

  we have discovered the library that was left by
your pioneers after their attempt to colonize this
planet had failed and according to the instructions
left for the discoverers we are attempting to estab-
lish communication with you do not reply to this
message because our receiver has not yet been in-
stalled we will inform you when we are ready
we are now going to repeat the signals to another
receiving station in case this is not heard we are
transmitting from a point on the earth which co-
ordinates  and  n -

  the coordinates that hargraves gave in his mes-
sage were obtained from one of the martian maps
made during their stay on this planet it must be
remembered that any translation that can be made
from the martian language into our own must of
necessity be decidedly free the two languages have
nothing in common only the thought-forms can
be given for this reason the above is but a free
translation of the messages sent hurtling through
space to the planet of mystery at the rate of 
miles per second

  the call signal was repeated four times and four
times the same message was sent out that night
each time to a different receiver in the hope that
one of them at least would reach its destination
we would have to wait until the remainder of our
receiver arrived before we could learn if we had
been successful or not

  four days later the receiver was completed and
was rapidly installed but much to our chagrin the
night was cloudy and never once did we catch a
glimpse of the planet although the telescope was
kept pointed to it throughout the night and the
eyepiece was never left for an instant when there
was the slightest chance of catching a glimpse of it

  the following night was more favorable and we
were able to see the planet long enough at a time
to allow a setting to be made on the computed posi-
tion and to send our call out once more this time
followed by a short announcement to the effect that
we were ready to receive

   for fifteen minutes in which time a returning sig-
nal should have reached us we waited anxiously
minute by minute passed without a single sound
emanating from the receiver phones with which we
were both equipped  our attempt we thought had
failed again we tried and for a few minutes the
clouds parted long enough for us to train the beam
on a second station again we waited anxiously
but no reply was heard clouds prevented us from
making another attempt that night and with the
dawn we closed up filled with disappointment

  i awoke about eleven oclock to hear hargraves
calling me he entered at my answer and in his
hand he held a copy of a late edition of the morning
paper
the return of the martians



  look at this he said pointing to one of the
front page column heads this is what i read

radio experimenter claims to have heard
message from mars

  calgary alta-robert eastwood a radio ex-
  perimenter of this city claims to have heard
  signals last night which he believes to have come
  from an extra-terrestrial source the signals
  mr eastwood states were extremely faint and
  were heard when he was measuring static in-
  tensity at different wave-lengths the amplifier
  consisted of six stages of audio frequency pre-
  ceded by a very sensitive detector of his own
  invention the signals were likened to the
  whistle heard in a regenerative receiver and as
  his detector cannot oscillate they could not be
  due to that cause they were badly distorted
  by the high amplification used

     it seems most likely that these were the har-
  monics of some commercial transmitter rather
  than what mr eastwood claims them to be
  though he is most emphatic in his denial of this
  possibility

  have i made a mistake in the position of the
receiver that i gave them i exclaimed jumping
out of bed and hurrying to the den in my dressing
gown no i replied to my own question there
has been no mistake i wonder if those signals were
meant for us

  a very strange coincidence if they were not
replied my companion can the martians have made
a mistake in our position or an error in their
direction 

  hardly likely i exclaimed wait a minute
though i have an idea going to the telephone i
called the meteorological observatory the director
of which is a friend of mine and asked for a report
on the general cloudiness of the night before the
reply was what i expected-clouds covered the
northwestern states and western canada as far east
as the great lakes the general conditions over the
western hemisphere north of the tropics were
cloudy evidently the martians could not get their
bearings well enough to direct their beam to the
correct position for it must be remembered that we
were on the unilluminated side of the earth east-
wood had heard the signals intended for us we
thought

  the cloudy spell broke that afternoon leaving us
with a clear sky full of expectation we sent our
signals out once more as soon as the planet was in
position twenty minutes after our first call the
headphones with which we were both equipped
clattered violently causing us to remove them re-
ducing the intensity we replaced them and har-
graves commenced to put into shorthand the mes-
sage that roared through

  train upon the elysium receiver commanded
my companion after the phones had ceased sound-
ing i rapidly computed the new setting point and
directed the telescope thereon

  at my all set another message was sent out
guiding the telescope as i was i had no idea of
what was going out or coming in i would have to
wait until we were all through before i could learn
the context of the messages

  it was the biggest thrill i had ever experienced as
i sat back there on the observing ladder with my

eyes glued to the binocular eyepiece and my fingers
on the slow motion controls with which i corrected
the slight irregularities of the driving clock now
and then the image would be blurred by a wave of
poor seeing and i would strain to hold the cross
wires on the point on which i was guiding my
landmarks having disappeared in the general blur

  two hours were taken uji in this way without a
break other than was necessary to turn the dome or
shift the ladder as the rotation of the earth carried
the planet across the sky eventually hargraves
made the cryptic remark well thats that all
through old man come and get some coffee and
have a smoke you need it ill read this out to you
i was glad of the respite for the strain had been
great and my eyes and head ached with the intensity
of my efforts

chapter ii

it would take up too much space in this account
to repeat the messages sent and received word
for word the reader who wishes to read the
exact messages will find them published in the spe-
cial bulletin issued by my observatory

  our first message was to the effect that we had
attempted to communicate with them the preceding
night and were now ready to receive then we
reported that signals had been heard by an experi-
menter in another locality some three hundred miles
away and inquired if these emanated from their
transmitter at this we stood by for the return
message which as you know nearly deafened us
with its intensity the message ran as follows
congratulations we were expecting the library
to be found about this time our observations
showed that it was still where we left it we heard
all your signals they were quite strong and well
directed it is unfortunate that you did not hear
us last night the error was ours conditions at
our transmitting station were none too good and
this combined with the masking of the lights of
your cities by dense clouds caused an error to be
made you were evidently just outside the beam
tell us how the discovery of the library came about
now transmit to us for  day-during this in-
terval we will transmit to you then stop to receive
the message which will take that time to reach you
in this way no time will be lost

  following the receipt of this message hargraves
sent to our martians an account of his deductions
and the resulting discovery of the library a few
moments after his conclusion the phones sounded
again and a communication of about seven minutes
duration was received this was followed by others
at intervals of the same length my companions
messages were accounts of the progress of civiliza-
tion on this planet and need not be recorded here
the following is an abstract of those received
shortly after the retreat to mars another un-
foreseen catastrophe overtook the martians the
survivors of the expedition unknown to them car-
ried the seed of death back to the parent planet all
known diseases had long since been eradicated from

   the decimal amounts to nearly seven minutes the mar-
tians being unaware of our system of measuring time were
compelled to adopt this method of conveying the time inter-
val to us this system is used a great deal in astronomical
work for as will be seen it facilitates computation consid-
erably


amazing stories

the planet mars but the returning pioneers carried
with them a new and more malignant enemy than
had heretofore been encountered this did not
attack those who carried it back with them as their
special physique and the acclimatization to which
they had been subjected had rendered them immune
to it even though they were carriers within a year
of the return of the survivors the wonderful sys-
tem of the martians was sadly disorganized over
half the population were dead or dying from the
awful plague which swept over the planet like a
scourge despite their knowledge of bacteriology
and medicine the plague continued unchecked until
no more than one hundred and fifty of the original
millions of the planets teeming population were
left alive all these were survivors of that ill-fated
expedition to the earth

  a stupendous task confronted the survivors men
of their calibre could not stand by and see all that
they had gained lost without a struggle to the
everlasting credit of those heroes of the past let it
be said that the loss was small and the martians of
today have them to thank for the advanced position
they hold picture if you will the problem before
them the survivors few of whom were scientists
as they understood the term had to set to work to
educate their offspring and to inoculate them with
the high ideals held by the vanished martian com-
munity the sciences which were first stressed were
those of fundamental importance to the economic
life of the race they included biology chemistry
and engineering in all its branches all the applied
sciences which were vital to the perpetuation of the
race

  it must be remembered that the planet was fast
losing its water supply and that the first thing to
do was to continue the operation of the vast works
already constructed to conserve the planets vital
fluid truly a tremendous task for so few

  a century later saw the planets population in-
creased to a little over twenty thousand inhabitants
these were divided into district groups each group
being responsible for the upkeep of all the state
machinery within its borders-a tremendous task
for much of the apparatus and plants had suffered
from neglect during the early part of the century
thanks to the alloy-which we have called arenium
-that was used in its construction corrosion and
oxidation did not affect the pumping machinery of
the water conservation system in many places
though neglect had played its part in rendering
inoperative many of the great public power plants

  the social system that had been developed before
the cataclysm held steadfast throughout the greatest
trials that any system could be subjected to and
never once did it waver throughout the darkest times
the planet ever knew it must be said however
that the survivors and their descendants continued
with the desperate remedy instituted long before
of eliminating all who would or could not work
under their system thus saving the unity of the
whole at the expense of a few

  under these adverse conditions it is not to be
wondered at that the martians made no progress
until they discovered how to conquer the subtle dis-
ease that ever threatened them little advance was
made in any of the sciences except bacteriology and
medicine eventually the corps of workers who
were continually engaged with the problem discov-
ered the means of eradicating the loathsome disease

which was akin to leprosy from that time their
advance had been slow but steady

  it will be of interest to my readers  think to
record here the report we received on the reception
of our first signals the first receiver we had
trained on was one located in the solis lacus region
the time there would correspond to about  p m
here this particular receiver was located in an
observatory and the quiet of the afternoon had been
broken by the mellow sound of the alarm followed
a few moments later by a second immediately the
members of the observatory staff were in a state of
suppressed excitement the earth had awakened
from her long lethargy connections were at once
made to all the public annunciators and before the
message came through the whole of the planet knew
that the earth was in communication with them at
last the direction indicators that were at once
applied gave them the position of our transmitter
they recognized that the signals were coming from
a building they had always suspected of being an
observatory a few minutes later the second re-
ceiver the one in the region we call arcadia sounded
its alarm and the second message-a repetition of
the first was received

   was somewhat surprised at the fact that the
martians admitted showing excitement at the re-
ceipt of our signals for i had thought that the
emotions would have become practically non-existent
with the high development of the martians we
learned later that they had wisely preserved these
emotions some being developed even had this not
been the case they would have become machine-like
automatons and this state was looked upon by them
with horror only the undesirable had been
eliminated

  on the conclusion of our inter-communication
they asked us to call them the following night as
there was an important problem under discussion
and they expected to give us some interesting in-
formation

chapter iii

the following night the skv cleared about
eleven oclock much to our relief and re-
mained clear throughout the rest of the night
fifteen minutes after our calling signal had been
sent out the answer arrived as the message came
through i heard hargraves exclaim good lord
and then relapse into silence imagine my curi-
osity the message ceased and- hargraves turned
to me with the question how would you like a
trip to mars

 are you joking i asked in amazement no

i am not he replied the opportunity is offered
to us do you accept 

  of course i accept t answered at once how
is the journey to be made

  ill tell you later it you are sure you want to
go we can take two others along with us t am 
going with that he turned to the keyboard and
sent a short message

  in a few minutes the martian signals commenced
again and continued for the space of perhaps thirty
minutes when they ceased mv companion said
much to my surprise that is all for this time

  what is wrong t asked for we had arranged
to ask quite a number of questions in the hope of
solving some of our individual problems you
the return of the martians



havent actually sent out all that stuff have you

  no need to was his reply we arc going
there to find things out first hand

  when i asked

  in about fifteen days hargraves informed me
listen to this  sat on the steps of the observ-
ing ladder while he read the message lie received it
ran as follows

  since receiving your first signal we have been
considering which would be the best method of
learning all we can from you as well as instructing
you in all the things that we think will be of value
to you it has been decided that the best method
will be for you to visit us during the coming con-
junction of your planet to this effect we will send
you one of our space machines to bring you to this
planet as you probably know we are not able to
withstand the extra strain to which our bodies are
subjected on the earth so that we are not able to
stay for any length of time moreover we do not
wish to run the risk of bringing disease back to our
planet again so we believe it will be best for you to
come here with our representatives in the machine
that will be sent for you you will understand we
feel sure that it is necessary for us to safeguard the
health of this planet above all things hence you will
not feel that you are subjected to indignities if
special precautions are taken for our protection

  the constitution of the atmospheres of the two
planets is nearly identical so that you will suffer no
inconveniences in that respect though the pressure
will have to be increased for you we will supply
you with protective coverings in which the pressure
can be kept suitable to your well-being we would
like to obtain as comprehensive a collection of your
books on social engineering and scientific subjects as
possible if you can obtain these for us let us
know hargraves informed them that this could
be done

  if you consent the machine will leave here as
soon as it is equipped and should arrive at its des-
tination in fifteen days time we desire you to be
prepared by then as it is not advisable that our
envoy stay on the earth any length of time if
these arrangements are suitable for you let us know
we will resume in five minutes

  when mars is in opposition to the earth the
earth is in conjunction with the sun to observers
on mars

  at this juncture hargraves sent the message sig-
nifying our assent to the martian plans during
the interval that had to elapse until our message
was received the following came through

  you may wonder whether we have visited the
earth throughout the ages that have passed since
our first experience there we have several times
but we found the conditions not ripe for any attempt
to communicate with you consternation and terror
was manifested by those that saw us even one hun-
dred years ago our year being equal to  of your
days  of ours since then however you have
evidently made rapid progress the rapidity of
your recent advancement shows that your men of
science at least are breaking away from the savage
superstition that always surrounds a race in its
development you have learned we believe the
great lesson that because a thing or phenomenon is
not understood it is not necessary to call in un-
natural or supernatural explanations to account
for it

  then came a brief pause followed by

  your acceptance of our offer has been received
it will be as well for you to prepare a store of pro-
visions to last you at least fifty days in case that the
food which we can supply proves unsuitable for you
in case you have perishable supplies we will pro-
vide methods of preserving them our machine will
land on the water of the landlocked bay due south
of your observatory unless you inform us that it
is inadvisable it will aid the pilot if you mark your
position with a large white banner with a black
circle upon it kindly be prepared to board the
machine at once unless you have some important
question to put to us or information to give us
this will be the last time we will communicate with
you until we see you here on this planet we will
close this communication by wishing you an inter-
esting and profitable voyage to this parent planet
of yours

  well old man what do you think of that
said hargraves as he concluded reading the
messages

   i dont know what to think of it i replied it
seems more like a dream than reality ill believe it
to be true when the martians arrive

  i feel somewhat like that myself said my com-
panion it does seem too remarkable to be true
however i guess we had better send a wire to
washington for those books if they are to be here
in time we have plenty to do before we leave
now then who are to be the other two that will
accompany us

   would like to take my wife along i am sure
she would like to go i said we should take a
member of the gentler sex along with us anyhow
dont you think so

  of course she must come along with us was
hargraves comment who else

  nay that is up to you i replied i suppose
that one of the washington people should go they
made this thing possible

  i think that i will leave it to smythe to select
the fourth member ill wire him right away said
hargraves

  the following days kept us busily employed for
there were many preparations to be made my wife
had agreed to accompany us after only a moments
hesitation and many of her suggestions were exceed-
ingly useful to us the books arrived from wash-
ington with a day to spare there were nine large
crates of them i wondered if there would be room
for them all in the space flyer

  the fourth member of our party was dr smythe
himself he decided to accompany us as soon as
he read hargraves telegram he had taken the
greatest interest in hargraves work and read the
martian language as well as the discoverer of the
library could he would be an exceedingly useful
member of the party

chapter iv

naturally we were all on the qui vive on
the day that the martians were expected
and never before were the heavens watched
with greater excitement at about three oclock
a dark speck was sighted in the blue which rapidly
became larger revealing it to be a machine-evi-
dently the one we expected after a long spiral
glide the machine struck the water in a cloud of


amazing stories

spray it was traveling at a high rate of speed-
about two hundred and fifty miles an hour i judged
-when it landed and shot along to the dock where
wc waited we had marked our position as we
had been directed luckily the dock which be-
longed to a marine engineering firm was deserted
for it was saturday afternoon and the employees
had left only the watchman was present besides
ourselves as the space flyer swung alongside the
machine was about one hundred and twenty-five feet
long with a diameter of perhaps thirty feet it
was torpedo-shaped with single wings and a span
of a good hundred feet formed the supporting sur-
faces when in the air it had the familiar rudder
and elevators but it lacked any visible means of
propulsion

  a large glazed port swung inwards as we pulled
the machine to the dock disclosing a figure which
at first glance appeared to be clad in old-fashioned
armor he was a giant fully nine feet tall and if
one could judge from his protecting armor with a
chest like a barrel his head was enclosed in a
transparent globe which fitted into the neck-piece of
his covering permitting us to see the smile of greet-
ing upon his rather handsome features his fore-
head was broad and high and his head was crowned
with a mass of curly chestnut hair

  what the watchman thought i do not know but i
heard a gasp and a lor lumme from him we
had told no one of the intended visit

  as our little group approached the open port the
giant handed us a sheet of material upon which some-
thing was written hargraves read it and turned to
us saving bring the baggage to the edge of the
dock with the aid of the watchman we trundled
the cases up to the machine on a hand truck that
we had borrowed and as each piece was brought tfp
a jointed arm built up on the lazy tongs principle
shot out and clasped it whisking it away into the
interior of the machine in a very short time all
our effects were on board and we followed

  we found ourselves in a broad passageway tra-
versing the craft at the opposite end of which was
a second glazed port similar to the one that now
swung to behind us the space was half full of
the baggage that had come aboard leading aft was
another smaller passage and down this we were led
by our guide four compartments opened off from
this alley and we were directed into one of them as
we entered there came a rushing sound and the
machine began to plough slowly through the water
through the broad glazed windows of the cabin we
saw the dock slide by the sound grew to a roar
and the water slipped past us faster and faster until
our view was obscured by a dense cloud of spray
suddenly the spray cleared and we saw the surface
of the water dropping rapidly away from us we
were aloft and swinging northward at an enormous
speed over the harbor

  the land dropped away and the topography of
vancouver island unfolded itself below its lakes
appearing like little gems glittering in the sunlight
northward we flew ever climbing soon we could
descry the smoke of vancouver lying like a pall
over burrard inlet and the fraser river winding
eastward into the distant hills ever climbing at a
terrific rate we sped over the mountains while the
fjords of the coast appeared below us and the queen
charlotte islands rose out of the blue pacific to the
northwest

  so great was our pace that the land many miles
below could be seen swinging by like a panorama
we were up in the rare atmosphere and the roar of
the driving jets as i supposed it to be gradually
diminished in intensity with the lessening atmos-
pheric pressure until presently it was but a faint
murmur gradually even this faint sound faded
out as we passed beyond the limits of the earths
envelope and the familiar blue of the sky gave way
to the blackness of interstellar space studded with
its brilliant suns

  the cabin was now brilliantly lighted by circular
transluscent plates on the walls and ceiling behind
which the source of light was hidden this illumina-
tion was now necessary for the diffuse light which
illuminates a room through its windows when there
is a considerable amount of air present was now
lacking only a bright patch of sunlight appearing
on the forward bulkhead of the cabin which shed
a faint light in the cabin

  i am afraid that the impression we had given our
first martian acquaintance was not very favorable
for in the excitement and interest of leaving the
earth we had neglected the elements of courtesy
this thought seemed to strike us all about the same
time for hargraves turned and wrote a short sen-
tence on one of the pads with which we had provided
ourselves and handed it to the martian who had
remained seated since he ushered us into this cabin
after reading it he took a small box from his belt
where it hung and connected a tube leading from
it to the lower part of his helmet he then spoke
for a few moments the voice though muffled by
the casing seemed soft and melodious after he
had spoken he took a sheet of paper-like substance
from the box where it had gradually jerked into
view as he spoke and handed it to hargraves

  i apologized said hargraves to us for our
rudeness in neglecting our host the way we did and
explained that the novelty of the situation was the
cause our friend here understands how we feel
about it ilis note goes on to explain that the cover-
ing he wears is to protect him from the danger of
contracting disease as well as to protect his body
from the pressure of the air in the space flyer
which will be kept at the barometric height we are
accustomed to we will be required to wear some-
what similar suits when we go into other parts of
this craft this portion is sealed off and assigned
to our use there are two sleeping chambers opposite
and the cabin is next to this he will now see
about storing our food suppliesif one of us will go
with him by the way this is the commander of
the craft

  my wife and i retired with the skipper after har-
graves had introduced us in the next cabin were
several large receptacles built into the wall and fitted
with devices to prevent their contents from moving
these were the refrigerators which had been prom-
ised us they were kept at a low temperature by
the mixture of chemicals which absorbed heat on 
uniting-an endothermic reaction arrangements
were also supplied for heating and cooking again
of a chemical nature this time the admixture which
gave out heat-an exothermic reaction two com-
mon examples of these reactions are the heating
of a mixture of unslaked lime and water which is
exothermic and the cooling of a mixture of sodium
hyposulphite the photographers hypo and
water-endothermic we spent the better part of
the return of the martians



an hour transferring our food supplies to the food
chests eventually we finished and at once repaired
to the observation windows of the main cabin

  dr s my the asked the commander for information
as to our speed and other details we were now
some live hundred miles above the earths surface
and as we could see over the polar regions our
speed was then about forty miles per second and
was being gradually accelerated until we reached the
final velocity of the order of ninety miles per second
which velocity would be retained until we got near
to our destination our guide then offered to con-
duct us through the machine and let us meet the
other members of the crew which numbered four
on our acceptance of his offer he showed us where
our suits were stored assisted us to don them and
showed us how to adjust them so that they fitted
comfortably

  these suits were much like divers suits which
likeness was enhanced by the globular helmet which
surmounted them following their adjustment we
were shown how to control the air filter and the
pressure adjustments we then followed our guide
forward into a small chamber on the walls of which
were several dials and indicators this was an air
lock and here the pressure was reduced to that of
the other compartments the air was sterilized and
our suits were sprayed truly the martians were
taking no chances nor could we blame them when
we remembered the billions of bacilli that were in
our system or lurked in our clothing

  after the lapse of a couple of minutes a second
door was opened and we entered a large room about
thirty feet long and the full width of the machine
in the center of it a cylinder about seven feet high
and five feel in diameter rose up through an open-
ing in the floor from its top led two large pipes
one passing forward and the other aft a gentle
heat radiated from them on the forward wall
of this cabin on either side of a central door were
a number of valves and gauges or indicators of
some kind a second martian came aft to meet us
as we entered he was heavily bandaged about the
thighs and abdomen but wore no other clothing or
ornament the flesh was brown as though from
continual exposure to the sun his head like that of
his commander was crowned with curly chestnut
hair he walked with apparent difficulty to where
we stood with a smile of welcome upon his
features then turning to his superior who was
relieving himself of his armor took the automatic
writer from him and dictated into the mouthpiece
for a few moments then held out the sheet dr
smythe took it and read aloud for our benefit it
contained a word of welcome and an invitation for
us to avail ourselves of the opportunity of having
the mechanism of the craft explained this was
accepted with alacrity and the second giant then took
us in charge

  this compartment and the one directly below it
contained the power plant of the space flyer the
central cylinder was the mixing chamber in which
the chemical fuel of the craft was forced by injec-
tors the fuel was in the solid form and was
pulverized before going to the injectors on admix-
ture it exploded spontaneously and the resulting
gases were led forward and aft by the two pipes we
saw tle pipes divided into four each branch
supplying a nozzle outside the hull of the craft
these nozzles could be turned and thus the machine

was guided when in space-the jets of incandescent
gas propelling the machine as a rocket is propelled
aloft the tubes and combustion chamber were cov-
ered with insulating jackets to prevent undue loss
of heat-heat being synonymous with energy in a
heat engine the pressure in the combustion cham-
ber was of the order of fifteen hundred atmospheres
or about twenty-two thousand pounds to the square
inch the temperature being  degrees absolute
which by subtraction of  gives the centigrade
temperature of  degrees

  the first martian now joined us attired in the
manner of his companion this attire was to sup-
port their inner organs under the greater strain to
which they were subjected on or near the earth we
were now led through the central door in the bulk-
head to the foremost compartment-the control
cabin here we saw the third member of the crew
of the same fine type as the others but with slightly
darker complexion lie was seated in a comfort-
able padded chair and his eyes were at the eyepieces
of what appeared to be the eye-end of a telescope
as indeed it proved to be the rounded transparent
nose of the craft gave the pilot a clear view of the
heavens ahead of him above the control cabin
we were told there was the objective of a huge
refracting telescope when passing through the
atmosphere a streamline hood swung over this that
accounts for our not having seen it the focal
length of the lens which was over eight feet in
diameter was about one hundred and twenty feet
sixty feet away over our apartment was a plane
mirror which reflected the converging beam back
again to a point just ahead of the pilot where an-
other mirror reflected the beam down to the eye-
pieces this huge instrument was necessary in order
that the pilot might avoid any small bodies in space
for with a velocity of such amounts as those we
were attaining it was necessary to see a body at
least three hundred miles ahead in order to avoid
it bodies too small to be seen with the power used
were too small to damage the craft several times
during our journey across the gulf we saw brilliant
flashes of light on the transparent nose-cap due to
the impact of small particles of matter this nose-
cap was made of one of the toughest and hardest
substances known to the martians so hard that it
was worked only with the greatest difficulty ob-
jects to be made of it were usually cast into shape
to avoid machining the components of the great
lens over our heads were made of the same material
though of different densities in order that the lens
might be achromatic

  in front of the pilot was a semi-circular dash-
board on which the various instruments of naviga-
tion were mounted these were pointed out and
described to us an air speed indicator automatic-
ally corrected for varying densities of the atmos-
phere through which the machine might fly pres-
sure gauges indicating the pressure in the combustion
chamber and the atmospheric pressure a flow indi-
cator that showed the rate at which the propelling
gases left the nozzles while other instruments sup-
plied the other data that were needed by the pilot
in the operation of his craft such as total-run meter
and space-speed indicator this latter aroused my
curiosity how i asked could the velocity of the
machine be measured in space the method was
explained to me and the theory of it proved to be
quite simple one of two periscope-like arrange-

of the sharpest and strongest spectral lines formed

if the line shifted one way or the other the extra
heating effect upon one of the wires caused a flow
of electricity to pass through it which by an ar-
rangement somewhat like the wheatstone bridge
automatically recentcred them the wires were con-
nected to an indicator as the space flyer approached
or receded from the sun fhe spectral lines shifted
toward the violet or red respectively-the well-
known doppler-fizeau effect-thus indicating the
velocity of the machine with respect to the sun
knowing the angle between the path of the machine
and the line joining the machine and the sun the
-true velocity was easily found by an elementary
trigonometric computation which was automatically
performed

  on returning to our own quarters we were shown
how to operate the air lock so that we could come
and go at will my wife had gone to them some
time before and as we entered we were pleasantly
surprised to find the swinging table spread witli a
hearty supper i suddenly realized that i was
hungry and on looking at my watch was surprised
to find that it was after eight oclock pst we
had been on our way for five hours the earth
now appeared as a huge silver crescent with a smaller
one the moon to the right of and beyond it

  the meal finished we returned to the pilot cabin
to find the fourth and last member of the controls
and the martian he had relieved talking to him
here we remained learning more about the strange
craft and its operation the air supply we learned
was replenished with oxygen and the carbon dioxide
removed while the air passed through the filters
which it did every five minutes as this system was
continually in operation for landing the hull of
the craft was flattened below and stepped like that
of a hydroplane it was also equipped with wheels
that disappeared into recesses in the hull much like
our earthly amphibians

  when we retired a gulf of half-a-million miles
had widened between us and the earth which now
appeared as a crescent twice the size the moon
presents as seen from the earth cynthia herself
was visible now but a third of her familiar self
beyond and to the right of her big sister the sun
appeared to the left-a flaming orb with a single
scarlet prominence at least a quarter-of-a-million
miles in height on the western limb

  to complete a rather sketchy description of this
our temporary home i must mention the arrange-
ment of the sleeping quarters the beds couches
or berths which ever you want to call them were
slung in a frame in such a manner as to always
remain horizontal below them were cupboards in
which we could keep our meagre personal effects
the machine had been gradually assuming a tilt
upwards towards the bow until we now had to use
the hand-rails when we moved about the craft we
were rapidly losing weight too all our movements
were being made with the greatest ease

chapter v

the following day according to our reckon-
ing found us nearly two million miles on our
way i was caught unawares on awaking
much to my wifes amusement for i sat up suddenly

in bed as is my wont only to precipitate myself
from the bed until i came into contact with what
had been the forward bulkhead but which now
appeared to be the ceiling it took us some little
time to get used to this new state of affairs and
many amusing little incidents took place before we
became accustomed to the rapidly vanishing effects
of gravity

  day after day went by uneventfully and during
this time hargraves and smythe set to work to
master the spoken language of the martians which
proved an easy task to them my wife and i also
set ourselves the same task and worked at it steadily
so that before we arrived at our destination we
could make ourselves understood the language of
the martians is as logical as a language can be
there are no confusing exceptions and the verbs
are as simple to master as are the written ones that i
described in my first account

  we spent most of our time in the control cabin
as we neared our destination and watched the surface
features of the ruddy planet unfold as its distance
decreased one afternoon icaught a glimpse of a
canal like a spider web  the planets surface then
another and another until the surface was seen to
be covered with an intricate network of them

  on the day before our arrival we were startled
to see brilliant jets of flame shoot ahead of us they
were from the retarding nozzles which the pilot had
opened almost at once the bow of the machine be-
came its floor for the past few days there had
been no up or down to us now with our negative
acceleration the direction in which the craft was
pointing became our nadir

  in spite of our suppressed excitement we slept
well and awoke on the eleventh day to find the
planet a huge disk slightly to one side of our path
the flow of the jets was increased from time to time
as we neared our goal our pilot was reducing our
speed and directing the craft so that it would strike
the upper layers of the atmosphere tangentially with
the velocity that would carry the machine round the
planet like another satellite in a circular orbit if
all power were cut off

  as we neared the planet its features became more
and more resolved and i was intensely interested
in noting the development of details which i had
observed from the earth as only the most vaguely
defined spots or blurs

  we struck the outpost of the atmosphere over
the northern point of the syrtis major the great
hour glass sea which huygens had drawn three
hundred years ago eastward we swept ever near-
ing the planets surface until when over the region
we call elyseum the trivium charontis a veritable
junction of canals appeared on the horizon

  the lucus triviae of the trivium was our ob-
jective and over this we glided in a great spiral
the oasis becoming a tessalated region centered
by a vast city beneath our feet in a couple of
minutes we were skimming the roofs of that city
then as a vast pile loomed ahead of us there was a
slight jar and the machine was rolling along a
smooth runway we had landed on one of the
galleries of a huge pyramidal building

  a port below the wings was opened as the machine
came to rest and the commander of the expedition
stepped out beckoning us to follow there were
no crowds to meet us-only a single martian came
forward from a large doorway as we alighted we
the return of the martians



were handed over to this newcomer with the advice
that we were to go to the official welcome led by
the guide we entered the doorway into a small
chamber on our entrance he pressed one of a row
of numbered switches and the chamber glided
smoothly away in a moment or two it stopped and
we stepped out into a large well-lighted room whose
windows looked out on one of the broad galleries
encircling the building the diminished sun was
shining through the windows and in the rays of it
sat a martian who appeared to be older than any of
the few we had met before he was clad like those
in the space machine after they had removed their
supporting bandages after leaving the earth

  as we entered he arose and walked over to greet
us welcoming us on behalf of the people of mars
at his request we seated ourselves on the four chairs
provided for us in front of a circular plate of
some substance that glittered with all the colors
of the rainbow this plate was set vertically in a
panel of arenium and around it were arranged a
set of reflectors of parabolic form with tiny coils
of wire in their foci

  i am now going to introduce you to the people
of this planet said our host this instrument
transmits both the sound of the voice and an image
of anything placed before it in this way all may
see and hear you tell me how you name yourselves
on the earth

  hargraves did the honors telling the martian
our occupations as well as our names and finished
by introducing himself dr smythe added that our
presence on mars was due to hargraves who dis-
covered the library at the conclusion of this cere-
mony our host pulled out a small knob that pro-
jected from the panel the filaments in the reflec-
tors at once glowed a dull red and we felt our-
selves bathed in a gentle heat through our helmets
facing the screen the martian spoke i reproduce
as much as i can of his speech from hargraves
account for i missed most of it not having been
well enough advanced in the language to follow
it well

  citizens of mars he began we are able for
the first time to welcome to their parent planet
four of the descendants of that ill-fated expedition
which left to colonize our evening star many ages
ago you will all join with me i know in making
their stay which must necessarily be short as in-
structive as possible at the conclusion of their
visit let us hope that they will return to their planet
which they call the earth with the seeds of the great
social system that we developed so long ago and
may those seeds fall on fertile ground so that it
will not be long before the divers races of the earth
-for there are many i am told-will become as
one working together for their common welfare
and advancement

  our guests are dr smythe-the title doctor
indicating that he has attained a high degree of
learning in some special department of knowledge
in his case archaeology dr smythe had risen
from his seat in acknowledgement of the introduc-
tion we all did in turn dr hargraves another
archaeolbgist and the discoverer of the records our
ancestors left behind mr arnold an astronomer
who has made a special study of this world of ours
and whose instruments so well directed the messages
we received a short time ago and lastly mrs
arnold the wife of the astronomer who has the

distinction of being the only woman member of the
expedition

   each of our guests will now speak to you briefly
for they have gained some knowledge of our lan-
guage on their journey here

  our replies were short and to the point express-
ing our gratitude to the martian people for the great
privilege that had been accorded us and echoing the
hope that we should see the chaotic conditions
of our social system give way to and be replaced
by the perfect system that had been so well tried
and proved on mars we acknowledged our great
inferiority and hoped that they would be patient
with us and that they would overlook our multitude
of deficiencies my wife concluded by presenting
the planet with the store of books which we had
brought with the hope that their perusal would
elucidate the difficulties which they must have in
understanding such a complex system or such com-
plexity with a lack of system as existed on the
earth

  at the conclusion of the simple ceremony our
host outlined the social system of the martians to us

  as soon as the youth of mars showed their
natural inclinations they were trained along those
lines on the completion of the training they were
appointed to a vacancy that was opened for them
there being no more prepared for a line of service
than it was shown that the branch could absorb
their advancement from this time on was gradual
until their period of service ended the period of
service varied with the responsibility of the office
the shortest being the term of those engaged in
executive positions the longer of those engaged in
tasks which required but little effort the grading
of these tasks had been done scientifically by actual
measurement of the amount of energy expended in
performing them the product of the rate of en-
ergy expenditure and a time factor which was
logarithmic gave a constant quantity for all positions
from that of a simple machine operator to that of
the president in return for his labor each member
of the community was provided with the necessities
of life according to the needs of his family a state
credit was also given which allowed him to indulge
in the luxuries the planet afforded so highly de-
veloped were the martians that they did not need
supervising each man knew his duty and it was
done to the best of his ability no shirkers were
present nor had there been any for many ages it
must not be thought that it was fear of punishment
that kept each man to his task it was the knowledge
that he was part of a smoothly working machine
and that it was only by the co-ordination of the
whole that he could live and enjoy the benefits the
system gave him and his millions of companions
this wonderful system had developed from the
necessity arising for the united efforts of the planet
in the conservation of its water supply as lowell
suspected and pointed out in his mars and its
canals let me quote him

  -whether increasing common sense or increas-
ing necessity was the spur that drove the martians
to this eminently sagacious state we cannot say
but it is certain that reached it they have and
equally certain that if they had not they must all
die when a planet has attained to the age of
advancing decrepitude and the remnant of its water
supply resides simply in its polar caps these can
only be effectively tapped for the benefit of the


amazing stories

inhabitants when arctic and equatorial peoples are
at one difference of policy on the question of the
all-important water supply means nothing short of
death isolated communities cannot there be suffi-
cient unto themselves they must combine to solidar-
ity or perish

  the social and economic standing of every mem-
ber of the community was the same the birth rate
of the planet was stabilized in order to keep the
population well within the limiting number which
the planet could support two to three children being
the number allowed each couple love and mar-
riage with its subsequent family was the ideal of
the race before mating the applicants were sub-
jected to the most rigorous tests before the union
of the couple was duly recorded seldom indeed
was it necessary for the applicants to be refused this
privilege and once made never was a union dis-
solved the tests which were psychological and
physical showed infallibly whether the union would
be satisfactory or not marriage took place at what
we would consider an early age-as soon as both
members of the union were mature which corre-
sponded to an age of eighteen to twenty the
women of mars were much like the men save for
more rounded limbs and slightly shorter stature the
women were as active members of the planets eco-
nomic life as were the men they held the same
offices and incurred the same responsibilities the
only difference being that it was not usual for them
to assume these positions until their children were
no longer in need of them for the early training
was entrusted to the mothers the longevity of the
martians surpassed that of the jewish methuselah
an age of fourteen hundred years not being uncom-
mon sickness was unknown to them and death was
usually artificial for on feeling the effects of old
age coming upon them it was usual to go to one of
the state institutions where they were painlessly put
into the long sleep that knows no waking to some
of us this may seem cold-blooded but on due con-
sideration it appears to be the most humane pro-
cedure to be a useless member of a community and
a parasite upon others is not an enjoyable state

  on the conclusion of this outline our host who
we learned later was no less a personage than the
president of mars conducted us to the upper story
of the vast pile which formed the capitol of the
planet where the quarters which we were to occupy
had been prepared for us these had been sealed
and supplied with compressors to keep the air at
our customary atmospheric pressure our supplies
had been removed from the space flyer and carried
there we were hungry so we were left to appease
our appetites being directed to call our host when we
were ready to accompany him to the laboratories
where we had been asked to undergo an examina-
tion by a committee of scientists our meal finished
smythe went to the wall turned an indicator as he
had been instructed and informed our host that we
were ready donning our suits we passed out into
the gallery through the air-lock as directed in a
few minutes one of the numerous torpedo-shaped
aircraft that we saw speeding along the air lanes
swooped down and settled on the gallery our host
who was seated at the controls invited us to enter 
briefly the machine was described to us before we
left under the floor we were shown several cylin-
ders about a foot long and four inches in diameter
to these were connected heavy wires which led to

the driving and lifting mechanism the latter con-
tained many heavy coils of wire in a case supported
on two rails that were rigidly attached to the frame-
work of the machine over our heads the source of
power was likened to electricity but must not be
confused with that on flowing through the coils
a repulsive action was developed which drove the
machine upwards sliding on the two rails the con-
tainer so adjusted itself that the center of gravity
of the machine was directly below it thus accom-
modating itself for varytffg distribution of the loads
the machine carried a similar arrangement in the
stern served to propel the craft this was mounted
on a pivot which allowed the horizontal direction
of the driving thrust to be varied by the pilot in
order to steer the machine while a second set of
coils in the bow served to retard and stop the car
the power carried in the cylinders was enough to
drive the machine at a speed of nine hundred miles
per hour for thirty hours

  at my request hargraves inquired if the mar-
tians had not discovered how to transmit power by
wireless they had long ago was the answer but
its efficiency never reached a very high standard so
it had been abandoned as everything inefficient was
abandoned as soon as they discovered the source
of power they now used which was practically one
hundred per cent efficient compared with but six
per cent of the former

  we rose from the gallery as the operator turned
a dial and then shot forward in a westerly direc-
tion about half a mile above the city which shone
with wonderful beauty as the afternoon sun brought
out the bold but beautiful color schemes of the
architecture continuing his description of the flyer
and its operation our pilot informed us that the
ceiling of the machine was limited-above seven
miles the repulsive force was not enough to support
it-that was the reason another type had been devel-
oped for interplanetary work

  in a very short time we arrived at our destina-
tion covering the twenty-odd miles that separated
the two buildings in four or five minutes alighting
on one of the ever-present galleries we were con-
ducted to a chamber in which eight martians awaited
us i was the first victim and was led to an
antechamber in the center of which was a small
circular platform i was directed to stand on this
platform facing a tall white screen behind me and
to either side of me were circular batteries of lenses
above and below which were arranged long narrow
tubes of a transparent medium in front of highly
polished reflectors of some greenish material on a
table to the right of the screen were numerous in-
struments whose use i could not begin to guess
and a piece of apparatus i did recognize-a simple
conical pendulum

  directing me to remain motionless one of the
committee took his stand at the table while the
others crowded around the screen  was suddenly
bathed in a greenish glow and on the screen before
me there appeared an image of my figure as seen
from the front suddenly the chest of my protect-
ing suit seemed to be sliced away in the figure then
the flesh appeared just as though a vertical slice
had been made through my clothing gradually the
section plane cut deeper and deeper into my body
until the lungs heart and stomach were shown in
section it was a weird feeling to see oneself por-
trayed thus and it was all i could do to remain
the return of the martians



motionless i could feel nothing no more than
one feels the x-ray of which this was evidently
a glorified example in a few minutes the plane
had passed completely through me exposing every
fiber and nerve of my body in its progress to the
scrutiny of the watchers at the end i was asked
to step down and the operator went to the rear of
the screen reappearing with a number of sheets on
which i caught a glimpse of my figure as it had
appeared on the screen for a few moments some
of these which had been singled out by the group
were subjected to a careful scrutiny and discussion
then one of them turned to me and asked if i would
like to have corrected the various parts of my body
which were not functioning properly i finally un-
derstood his suggestion after several repetitions
on ascertaining that it would not take very long i
assented and was then put into the hands of two
others who entered at some signal the sheets were
given them and after a brief discussion of my case
i was led away into an adjoining room here i was
laid on a long white table whose surface was cov-
ered with some soft smooth material and a metal
clamp was attached to each ankle and wrist all
at once there seemed to be a snap in my brain and
my consciousness reeled for a moment-at least so
it seemed-the bands were removed and i was di-
rected to arise as i did so i was astonished to
find that my leg which had troubled me ever since
i was unfortunate enough to run foul of a five-
nine at vimy ridge was as well as the other and
at the same time i realized that my glasses had been
removed and that i could see far better than i ever
could see with them i was conducted back to
where smythe and my wife were waiting

  i thought you were never coming said my
wife what have they been doing with you

i	told her adding that i had not been gone for more
than ten minutes

  ten minutes look at your watch she re-
torted t looked at my wrist watch which i had
strapped outside the suit i wore i had been gone
nearly an hour and a half that night in our
own apartments i found several marks that looked
like old scratches on my body yet i had never felt
the slightest sensation of the operations that had
been performed on me but from that time on
several distressing symptoms that i had had for
some time before never bothered me again what
surgery t had been stripped operated upon in no
less than six places and dressed all in the short
time that i had been on the table

  after a few minutes hargraves appeared and
was equally surprised to find how long he had been
under that wonderful anesthetic he too had un-
dergone repairs as he called it

  we now returned to the flyer to find that it was
under the control of another pilot the president
having had an important call during our visit to
the laboratories our new pilot was one of the many
who had volunteered to instruct and entertain us dur-
ing our visit we were more than an hour in re-
turning for our guide took us all over the city
explaining and pointing things out to us on the
morrow he promised us he would show us some-
thing of the great martian irrigation system he
having been a high official in the engineering depart-
ment was assigned as our instructor in that subject

  that evening we watched the sunset from our
aerie and watched the rising of phobos the inner

moon of mars to an observer from the earth the
moons of mars present surprising sights for poets
and non-scientific authors to the contrary no heav-
enly bodies rise in the west to the inhabitants of
the earth yet here on mars we watched the rising
of phobos in the west for moving around its pri-
mary as it does in about h m it moves faster
around the planet than the planet turns on its axis
rising in the west it remains above the horizon
for about five and one-half hours setting in the east
to reappear in a like interval in the west running
through all its phases in eleven hours deimos the
outer moon was overhead at sundown here is an-
other strange sight the period of deimos is h
m hence he rises in the east but remains above
the horizon for over two days phobos the larger
of the two moons appears to have but one-fifth of
the diameter of the moon as seen from the earth
while deimos appears to be but one-twentieth

  while we sat there watching the shades of eve-
ning sweep over the city there came an alarm from
the annunciator and we heard the presidents voice
asking to see us he entered through the air-lock
a minute later and seated himself at the window
where we were grouped he said

  i was called away this afternoon to witness a
new discovery that has just been made discoveries
are now few and far between with us and this latest
has been stimulated by the news of your intended
visit some weeks ago it is a medical discovery and
the result of it is that we will now be able to visit
your earth with impunity the discoverer has found
that we can strengthen our bodies so that they will
be able to withstand many times the pull of gravi-
tation to which they are subjected here moreover
the drug so increases the resisting power of the
body that no disease will affect it as has been shown
by a subject who volunteered to try it on himself
he has been proved to be immune from the most
virulent germs cultures of which were injected into
him long enough ago to show definitely if they af-
fected him or not we have decided to accompany
you back to the earth to assist you in your task of
developing a system similar to ours modified where
necessary to conform to your special requirements

  a report from your examiners this afternoon
tells me that you are not adapted to use the chemical
foods that we use as perhaps you have noticed
we eat no foods such as you consume all our nour-
ishment is taken in the concentrated form in which
there is no waste matter this is one of the main
reasons for our longevity you will have to make
the change gradually

  from now until the end of your stay you will be
shown all that we can show you of this planet and
ample facilities will be given you for each to study
that part which interests him most on your return
you will be accompanied by four other machines-
the vanguard of our second invasion

  the president smiled that friendly smile typical
of all the martians as lie concluded i wondered
as i gazed out over the city which was now lit as
brightly as day how long it would be before we
would become as truly great as the martians had
become how long it would be before we would all
be able to treat creatures which were as inferior to
us as we must be to the martians with such kindness
and with an apparent lack of condescension and no
exhibition of superiority truly the martians were
great and more than worthy of emulation

chapter vi

the following day we were conducted on the
promised tour of inspection of the canals
we had arisen early to see the morning star of
mars a brilliant silvery white point of light in the
eastern sky accompanied by a fainter one close to
it it was hard to realize that this was our home
-over seventy million miles away our pilot of
the preceding afternoon arrived soon after we had
finished breakfast and we were whisked away at
once heading towards the northern polar cap fol-
lowing the great circle course of the dis a broad
belt of cultivated territory running due north and
south which is one of the seven larger canals
which spread fanwise northward from the trivium
we sped north at the highest speed the machine could
attain three hours flight brought us to the edge
of the fast melting cap and from aloft we could see
the whole countryside inundated with water as far
as the eye could reach we descended to within a
few feet of its surface and our guide pointed out
the lateral and main ditches which were fast carry-
ing the precious fluid to the great underground stor-
age basins moving further north we came to the
snow cap itself and here the machine settled while
we got out and stretched our legs it was mere
slush and streams of water had in many places
washed the snow away revealing the cap to be quite
thin we were informed that the maximum amount
of snow that fell was fifteen feet while the average
was about ten we returned to our machine and
were then taken eastward to where a great rift
showed in the cap this was the line of one of the
canals and fresh vegetation was already springing
up under the rays of the early summer sun now
turning the machines nose southward we proceeded
towards the utopia region and towards the wedge
of casius the latter a great angular marking on the
maps of the planet

  here we found a vast area under intensive cul-
tivation  huge machines plowing fertilizing and seed-
ing the ground on request our pilot dropped down
until our machine rested on the top of a gigantic
cultivator below we alighted and were conducted
into the interior the whole structure was vibrant
with hidden power as it moved forward at a speed
of perhaps ten miles per hour we were shown
into the control room where the operator sat of
course we were at once recognized and leaving his
seat he greeted us then conducted us below where
he explained the operation of the machine he would
leave it to guide itself for hours the body of the
machine was suspended about two feet above the
level ground on endless caterpillar treads the soil
was taken in forward by means of rotary scoops
after it had been loosened by the ploughshares
it was then carried to digestors which pulverized
and prepared it samples of the soil taken from
four points of the machines seventy foot width
were carried to mechanical analyzers which con-
tinuously determined the quantity and kind of fer-
tilizer required lo bring it up to perfection for the
crops raised here from which were obtained one of
the most important elements of their food supply
the analyzers then automatically regulated the sup-
ply of the different fertilizers which were supplied
to the digestors

  on leaving the machine the soil was spread in
the broad furrow from which it had been taken and

the process was completed by seeding and rolling

  the work was carried on day and night at the rate
of over three square miles a day for each machine
thousands of machines being engaged in the task

  leaving the cultivator we headed towards the
trivium once more following a new canal the
eunostos from the point where it leaves the wedge
at the aquae calidae for several hundred miles
crossing elysium and arriving home as the sun
was setting tired and hungry for we had eaten
nothing since breakfast

  the land is cultivated for widths from a few hun-
dred yards to ten miles on either side of the great
arteries of the planet depending upon the size of
the subterranean aqueduct in the case of the
larger arteries lateral pipelines convey the precious
fluid to the area under cultivation and the growth
that follows makes their course visible to the trained
eye at the other end of a good instrument under
the best observing conditions on the earth

  the next day we were shown the great under-
ground storage basins hundreds of square miles iii
extent where the precious fluid was sealed to pre-
vent loss by evaporation with each of these vast
reservoirs were associated the pumping machinery
of the system we stood in awe under the shadow
of the gigantic machines which would dwarf any
earthly construction into insignificance watching the
whirling metal shafts and the glittering piston rods
as they rose and fell thudding out the heart beats
of the planet which sent its life blood coursing
through its artfiicial veins

  day after day during our twenty-seven day stay
on the planet we were kept busily employed i
of course took the greatest interest in the astro-
nomical work of the planet and with a machine that
was placed at my disposal i visited the principal
observatories of that world how tiny even our
huge reflectors were compared with the instruments

i	saw there imagine how i felt when i took my
place at the eyepiece of the giant of the giant re-
flectors with a mirror more than seven hundred
feet across more than seven thousand times the
light-grasping power of the great mt wilson re-
flector with the thin martian air and its excep-
tional clarity and steadiness it was possible to make
observations with undreamed of powers powers so
great that for the first time i saw stars as disks tiny
disks it is true but nevertheless disks large enough
in some cases to see their photospheric disturbances
it is impossible for us on the earth to see any star
other than the sun as a disk due to the nature of
light until the diameters and hcnce the resolving
power of our instruments are greatly increased

  as the time for our departure drew near a deep
regret was felt by all of us so much had the inward
beauty of the martians taken hold of us and we
fell that we were leaving a paradise the one con-
soling thought was that we were not returning alone
but with friends who we felt sure would soon be
able to organize our woefully muddled world into a
world that would begin to approach the ideal we
had witnessed

  there seems no need for me to go into the details
of our return voyage or the surprise of the world
by the return of the martians the press has blazed
with headlines capping articles that in many cases
contained not a grain of truth and it has only been
with difficulty that the little community we have
built up has been kept aloof from foolish egotists
the return of the martians



who think they can match their minute brains against
the magnificent knowledge of the martians we
have had to lay down an impregnable barrier de-
vised by our friends around our camp in order that
we might nut be disturbed while the builders of the
new world are studying our planet at every angle
preparatory to launching their campaign let the

world rest assured there will be no sudden upheaval
but a gradual change in which the whole of human-
ity will benefit in a way the idealists have never
dreamed of even some of my friends economists
and idealists who thought that they had developed
the ideal system stand in awe of the millenium that
looms before them

editor amazing stories

  i just wish to continent upon a few of the
more recent stories of your worthy publication

  the machine man of ardathia is in my esti-
mation a marvelous scientifiction story mr
koblischkc in the january issue claims that it is
ridiculous that human beings should ever evolute
into sexless automatons is biologically improb-
able he thinks the story states to the effect
that the bi-chanifs and the tri-namics nropa-
gated their species by fertilizing the female
ovum in ecto-genetic incubators till it was past
the embryonic stage of development the young
bi-chanic or tri-namic was then encased m a
transparent cylinder finally this led to the
extinction of the female sex because it was no
longer necessary then the whole race began to
die off the machine man of ardathia created
synthetically the equivalent of the female ovum
and in ecto-genetic incubators developed it the
body after passing the embryonic stage was
placed in a transparent cylinder as had done
the bi chanics and tri-namics before them but
it was also supplied with tubes furnishing it the
necessary energy for rebuilding its body tissues
which was only a minor affair due to the small
amount of muscular activity carried on by the
ardathian now you see sex was no longer
essential an automaton defined is a machine
controlled by some external agency having no
volition or cognizance of its own the ardathians
had both these attributes wherefore call them
automatons they still thought and reasoned
somewhat as humans do they were not human
they were superhuman

  the ardathian was probably above most emo-
tions as wc know them emotions didnt come
from the reaction of their viscera as it does in
our case they were above  emotion as we
know it for this reason emotions arc traits of
mammalia which have been developed through
ages of maternal protection the extinction of
sex among the ardathians withdrew the maternal
instinct and its influences eventually died out

  now i dont see why this story should be
regarded as fantastic or inconceivable with
mans present tendency to rely upon machines to
do his work and even his thinking in some
eases the gap between the human being and
machine is rapidly lessening in width lliis is
a great speculative field the morbid vein in
which the story runs is altogether fitting for the
circumstances this story should set some of
your readers thinking of the possibilities of truth
that are evidenced in body

  the face in the abyss bv merritt in your
annual certainly was splendid the weaving of
legendary lore and tradition into the text of the
storv improves it the description of the face
of yu-atlanchi of the snake woman and
of the arts of the inhabitants of yu-atlanchi
was remarkable the science is altogether origi-
nal in this story

  the metal emperor now running in science
and invention is as weird and fascinating a
storv as t have ever read fancy metal given
volition and cognizance it isnt possible the
probability of extrosenses is also a strong one-
senses that even the oriental occultists are un-
aware of the story below the infra-lied
was interesting it contained a full measure of
good plausible science but it is altogether too
idealistic and the ending too incongruous hyp-
notism is not known to ensue without the aid
and co-operation of the recipient with the hyp-
notist lure however the wills were developed
so highly that a strong will could overcome a
wcakcrantagonistic will

  the camel doom certainly provided me with
enough thrills and food for speculative thought
description of the moment when the earths fate
was in balance with the odds altogether against
its coming out victorious was a true touch of
mastery by the author when he proposed a last-
minute rescue	l cordelias

bradley beach n j

  theres a note of sadness in the story about
the machine man of ardathia which you put
very well in your text we will agree that man
and machine are approaching one another some-
times we think that the approach is very close
in such establishments as automobile factories
in automatic machinery there is so much quasi-
intelligence that an automatic man would be a
possible concept of the future certainly a man
who spends day after day and year after year
in putting a minor part on an automobile that
passes slowly by him on a platform is to all
intents and purposes a machine man as long as
in- is thus engaged

  but do not imagine that our authors restrict
their narratives to absolute possibilities or
rather probabilities within the range of our
judgment and experience we do not know what
the future will bring forth and the world seems
ready for any new surprise that may come along
we certainly have had enough wonders to sur-
prise anybody even in the last five years-
editor

brickbats galore-our cover illus-
trations the target

  in looking over discussions i find that other
people have covered my likes and dislikes rather
thoroughly except for one small item not a large
one and one that may not interest the majority
of readers it is this your amazing magazine
cover outlandish

  can you imagine a staid business man middle-
aged with a leaning toward the glamour of sci-
ence furtively going up to the newsstand look-
ing over the magazines till no one is watching
then quickly snatching a copy of amazing
stories tuck it under his coat pay the girl and
slink away with dread lest some business ac-
quaintance might sec him and think he is reading
nick carter and thereby doubt his business
sagacity well my dear editor that is just my
predicament do you wonder that i am becom-
ing a nervous wreck i do not know where you
procurc the paper that you put into the magazine
nor the terrible colors and illustrations on the
outside but frankly they arc both quite passe
dont you know sincerely

                              r f debritt

	address not given

  we claim that we publish unfavorable as well
as favorable criticisms and wc think that this
letter attacking the cover illustrations proves
our claim first stated theres so mueh in the
illustrations and the blend of personality and
science is so well carried out in them that wc
can perfectly well imagine a staid business man
buying a copy without being furtive in any way
and without being ashamed of himself so if
the writer is really picturing himself as a pur-
chaser let him think it over and see whether he
is not needlessly disturbed if he will study
the cover illustrations attentively he will see
that sometimes they arc very remarkable pro-
ductions in the line of mcchanical detail the
artist paul who does many of them has a very
special ability in the line of producing this class
of work which most artists would find difficult
or impossible then too mr debritt might sub-
scribe to the magazine h comes fully wrapped
that way-editor

traveling into the future and
time traveling

editor amazing stories

i have just been re-reading the discussion col-
umns in the december issue of your magazine
and i notice in it a letter from i m lichtigman
of brooklyn in it lie speaks at length on the
fourth dimension and brings in an excellent
theory about duration of light waves but does
he know why time is considered the fourth di-
mension if not i suggest that lie take a pencil
and draws a line with it on a sheet of paper
now if that line is to exist at all it must have
length breadth and time for without this it
could not have been drawn

as it is possible to travel in the three dimen-
sions that we know of is there any plausible
reason why wc should not be able to travel in
nine mr lichtigman speaks of a theory of
duration of iiglil waves but this may have
nothing whatever to do with it the idea about
time is that once you have done something it
stays forever in a plane in time this plane can
be traveled in just as any other plane

as for the writers few words on traveling into
the future they carry no weight at all lie says
that if nothing exists its picture cannot be made
quite so but how does he know that things in
the future do not already exist when a blind
mail looks into a mirror he docs not see his
image nor can he feel hear or smell it there-
fore i suppose it docs not exist this is all
his reasoning comes to

my theory on time-traveling is that if you
can tiinc-travel you are invisible and have no
influence what would happen if you had take
one example suppose that  years ago when a
voting man you had been the owner of a large
house and you were debating as to whether you
should add ail extension to your house or not
you wrote a letter to the builders but threw it
away thinking better of your idea then you
went to the continent for a year

now if you can travel through time and have
influence in the past you coulago into the house
in safety and re write the letter and send it to
the builders the extension is then built

in the present time then a building will sud-
denly arise out of the ground but this is obvi-
ously ridiculous

concerning the illustrations paul may be a
good artist but f am very glad that people do
not have faces like those of some of the people
in his pictures they are just as bad in the
metal emperor in science and invention more
illustrations by all means but less of these faces

one word in conclusion do not make amazing
stories semi-monthly it would be too much of
a good thing

also let us have another cover contest

wishing amazing stories a long and prosper-
ous life	malcolm e humphcry
norfolk england

referring to the last clause of your letter
first you will find that there is anothej cover
contest this time of  very original kind and
one which we think will excite considerable in-
terest and elicit material perhaps even better
than or as good as we secured by our last one
the cover contests arc absolutely for the benefit
of our readers to give them fresh literature to
read and to open the gate for new authors to try
their hand at writing scientific fiction and to
bring out new ideas artistic and scientific

of course traveling through time is quite the-
oretical and it is as far as we now know quite
impossible but the beauty of the subject is that
it brings up an interesting quantity of discus-
sions opens up an attractive field of suggestion
and certainly makes people think your interest-
ing letter is due precisely to such causes-
editor

 baron miinchhausens scientific adventures

by hugo gernsback

continued from page 

dieted the existence of a new planet neptune which
no one had ever seen before

  the martian that i was gaping at who was
standing nearest to me was between eight and nine
feet tall a veritable giant he had an immense head
with a straight forehead at least seven inches high
his light blue eyes were about two inches in diameter
and placed close together moreover they had a
marvelously intelligent as well as keen look in them
impossible to describe their hypnotic gaze held
one spellbound and seemed to go clear through you

  the long thin nose was enormous but harmon-
ized well with the rest of the face the complexion
was somewhat brown the large ears stood out
straight and looked like enormous oyster shells with
the inside turned towards me i fowever what caught
my eye particularly was the strange caps all mar-
tians wore these caps looked as i f they were made
of a flexible metal from their back dangled what

	thought to be a flexible metal wire we were
soon to know their purpose

  the chest or rather the torso of the martians
was simply out of all proportion to the rest of the
body it was enormous and made him look strangely
top-heavy his arms appeared thin and emaciated
as did his legs his hands had each two thumbs
and four fingers the extra thumb being between the
thumb and index finger as compared to the human
hand the hand itself was very small in fact it
looked much like an earth womans hand

  the feet were almost circular in shape and meas-
ured at least  inches in diameter the base looked
very much like an elephants foot although the ankle
was rather small and graceful as compared to the big
flat foot the outside of the martians dress glis-
tened strangely in the sunlight and i felt sure that
it must be made of a flexible metal unknown to us
it fitted rather loosely and did not appear to have
much style the upper part of the body was en-
closed in a sort of blouse such as our young boys
wear on earth the trousers looked like knickers
except that they extended down to the ankles

  while we were still gazing enraptured at these
strange marvelous beings we suddenly became con-
scious that our brains were being filled with a won-
derful sort of music which seemed to originate inside
our heads instantly the martians who had stood
around in a haphazard manner formed a lane the

center of which was formed by ourselves at the
one end we now perceived a colossal bewildering
structure with a church-like appearance which
seemed to turn around slowly on its axis when its
ponderous portals measuring at least  feet in
height had swung around so that they pointed in our
direction the structure ceased revolving immedi-
ately the portals slid back and out stepped a dis-
tinguished looking martian taller even than his
brothers he was dressed like them except that
his metallic cap appeared yellow in color

  at a gesture two martians stepped toward us
and taking oft our headgear replaced them with the
soft metallic caps by this time the distinguished
looking martian had come up close to us and stood
still only five feet away he next placed the tips
of the fingers of both hands to his temples which
we took to be a salute we hastened to respond
likewise but we must have executed the motion
poorly for a faint rather amused smile flitted over
the brownish features of the august martian then
he turned around and some attendants bade us with
a motion to follow the chief which we did he
then entered the church-like structure and we fol-
lowed him deferentially

  well alier my boy i guess the telegraphone
wire must be almost full by this time so i guess i
will have to close for today now dont forget to
listen in tomorrow night for theres a lot to be said
about this wonderful planet good-night  

  a low rhythmic hum for a few seconds then
click click-click-click click a snapping sound and
the ether between the moon and old mother earth
was undisturbed once more

  jean joseph lcvcrricr a french astronomer on august
  in a paper to the licole poly technique declared that
he had computed the orbit of a supposed new planet still
further removed than uranius which was then thought to
be the last planet in the solar system not only did lcverrier
predict the new planet but he predicted it to be a star of the
eighth magnitude most wonderful of all however he
actually indicated where this new planet should be located
in the heavens and he asked that astronomers should look
for it there this galle of the berlin observatory did on
september  of the same year and he found the new planet
within less than  from the spot indicated by levcrrier who
had never seen the planet himself lcverrier had based his
scientific prophecy upon certain observed irregularities of the
planet uranius although neptune is  miles away
from the earth-an enormous distance

some interesting criticisms of
writers and artists

   editor amazing stories

   i first made the acquaintance of one i m
   alier in the electrical experimenter and hail his
   return in amazing stories with tic pleasure
   one feels on meeting an old friend after years of
   separation i was a constant reader of the above-
   mentioned the magazine and carried on when it
   liecame scicnec and invention when the con-
   test to name amazing stories was announced i
   looked forward to its publication with keen in-
   terest and every issue has been a source of
   stimulating thought and pleasurable entertain-
   ment

    have read a number of stories by edmond
   hamilton which contained some excellent science
   and was about to inquire as to the probability of
   some of his work appearing in your magazine
   when i received my january copy containing
   the comet doom

    granting the usual freedom accorded to fiction
   writers in regard to the statement of unknown
   or disputed facts i am still unsatisfied by his
   description of the movements and positions of
    the mythical comet

   i astronomy has been a hobby with me since
   boyhood and although i lay no claims to mathe-
   matical genius in the realm of astro-physics i
   believe you will agree with me in the following
   statements

   	the comet of the story always rises in the
   east soon after sunset

   	it is stated very clearly that the comet
   was swinging out again from the sun on its out-
   ward journey into space

   	it is also stated tip to the climax of the
   story that the comet comes closer and closer to
   the earth

   now to consider these statements

   the action of the story would have been per-
   fectly logical if the comet had not risen in the
   cast every tiipht soon after sunset to have
   done so it would have had to be already past the
   earth and far out into space getting farther away
   every day had it been traveling in the path
   ascribed to it the comet would have either been
   high in the sky at sunset at the beginning of
   the story and farther toward the east each suc-
   cessive night as it passed the earth or would
   have risen after midnight and earlier and earlier
   until it reached the position in the story de-
   pending upon the direction it followed around
   the sun good fiction to describe its rising in
   splendor in the east each night as the sun set
   but poor astronomy nevertheless i shall wel-
   come more stories by edmond hamilton

   just a few comments on your illustrations i
   feel the urge to voice an opinion as i am my-
   selfa commercial artist and usually study illus-
   trations quite carefully

   your artist paul has a combination of sev-
   eral good qualities quite necessary in giving
   your stories selling punch cood en and ink
   technique live figures in his drawings and what
   is of paramount importance to a magazine like
   amazing stories-imagination

   i have detected several small slips i wish
   you would pass along  cannot recall the exact
   issue but i remember noticing at the time that
   in the story f the singing weapon paul has
   ftco bright lights shining on the form of the
   asiatic but only one shadow is cast on the wall
   behind it the story says the inventor was
   killed by the smallest vibranon he had ever
   made but there are several shown which arc
   smaller than the one he is holding

    the time machine if my memory is
   true wells has his hero depart into tbe future
   in a dinner coat he arrives in plus fours

   in the more recent the psychological solu-
   tion the greatest mystery to me was what be-
   came of the left side of the face of the man in
   the background seen between dr thane and the
   young biologist

   but i can truthfully sy that i have enjoyed
   paul s sketches fully as much as the stories
   themselves so as one artist to another please
   pass along my sincere appreciation of his work

                               w e moore
                               fremont ohio

   we are hapny to find a reader of electrical
   experimenter who is glad to meet an old friend
   i m alier and by the way none of our cor-

  respondents have shown any signs of catching
  on as the boys would say to the meaning of
  this name

  the  comet doom is not to be taken as a
  methodical treatise but we think it a very good
  story and one with considerable power what
  we say is confirmed by the fact that our readers
  have given us many favorable comments on this
  very story

  we are glad that you compliment our artist
  paul he has a very unusual faculty for illus-
  trating scientific stories into which apparatus of
  all sorts enters

  as regards the time machine it is quite
  possible that the trousers that went with his din-
  ner suit were of the loose oxford cut

  the figure in the psychological solution had
  his face partly bidden behind the pipe and we
  admit that by inadvertence a little bit of the
  outline seems to have been omitted

  in the singing weapon we do not find an
  obvious error in the shadows and a little indulg-
  ence may be asked perhaps for the relative size
  of the vibrator which is killing the investigator

critical notes on several op our

stories

  editor amazing stories

  i have been  render of your amazing stomfs
  for our months uul i have been u reader of
  science and invention popular mechanics popular
  science scientific -tmericun literary digest and
  the system or may twine of business for the past
  live years i keep a memorandum sometimes tak-
  ing the leaves from them for future reference 
  cannot get the satisfaction from liction that  can
  from magazine  have just mentioned

  the criticism which  am going to write to you
  may be crude not well construed and collective
  in the translating of the articles but my hope
  is that with your experience from a multitude ol
  correspondence you undoubtedly get from various
  individuals you can get the trend of thought 
  am trying to intelligently impart to you

  my criticism is for the february issue of your
  unique and interesting magazine i will give
  you my opinion of the various stories believing
  at least tliat i am nearly on an equal with the
  average individual who reads this issue some
  expect more some cannot grasp the thought and
  claim it to be impossible but looking through
  the issues of magazines i have already men-
  tioned and the picscnt-day achievements  say
  that not anything is impossible when the time
  comes for humanity to go on and use that thing
  to an advantage which seems impossible today
  these things will gather in the list of achieve-
  ments as other things have in the past

              the revolt of pedestrians
  i say it holds an inkling of the future it
  seems drastic absurd but for instance today
  oflice people not all but a small per cent do not
  walk in a days time i say three miles it is a
  bus elevator auto elevated surface lines su-
  burban train or subway it is a well told story
  very fitting for this magazine of yours

              huron muenclihansen

  part i is very good in itarlf hut shortit con-
  tains incidents and suggestions that are tood tor
  thought things that arc near reality

  part ii takes the mind away from part  very
  exaggerated in self-praise very humiliating to
  the achievements of the baron in part i pos-
  sibly so iu parts iii and iv from their titles

             the master of the world
  a story which cannot w criticized fully with-
  out part ii but a seemingly good narrative and
  well plotted

            pollock and the porroh man
  a narrative incredulous superstitious pol-
  lock must he easily disturbed or slightly de-
  mented on this subject voodooum evidently
  not a seasoned hunter or traveler of the scien-
  tist class of explorers

              fourth dimensional surgery
  an appealin narrativeof good imagination for
  one thing in the professions it mentions a
  thought to the lasker donation for prolonging
  life surgery in the next century or so who
  knows

              the disintegrating kay
  very good narrative lor the thinker chemistry
  or electrical research science is always inter-
  esting whether imaginative to a certain degree
  or not this story would be an appeal for
  greater researches and a gentle reminder of the
  martyrs of science

              the fourteenth farth
  the trend of imaginative thought is pood but
  does not complete the validity or void the tranj
  action of the return of kingston

              the fiyhtino hear

  a theme which many should read and a good
  tonic for doctors to practice for there arc many
  with the afflictions described here

                  smoke rings
  a short narrative with a thought as to whether
  it is possible to any certain degree but contain-
  ing ideas that are not entirely imaginative a
  very good chance for research	

  illustrations tell half the story chinese
  proverb a picture is worth  words a nar-
  rative of the trenches in the world war was very
  little to the officers but the airplane camera
  brought the actuality of the trenches before them
  and also could be consulted again for refresh-
  ing the ideas within the mind

  more illustrations in some stories and less
  elsewhere some stories reouirc more pictures to
  excite the imagination to the right pitch tor the
  narrative to be interesting put i would not
  discontinue them or the questions the questions
  to you are the same as applause to a vaudeville
  manager atld tells what the people want but you
  cannot please all

  i hope i have not taken up a great amount of
  your time lint hope i may have done some good
  with my ideas and suggestions

                                    chicago 

  the opening paragraph of your letter in one
  sense brings out the goal to which we arc reach-
  ing the object of amazino storifs is to supply
  fiction and the fiction is to be based on natural
  science so that ihc person who reads amazino
  stouts will not feel that lie is wasting hi- time
  on imaginary adventures and episodes but will
  realize that he is studying science or perhaps
  imbibing science

  the kind of letters we receive tell us that we
  are succeeding in our efforts in this direction
  our discussion column is extremely interesting
  because the letters come from people who think
  and the tribute to our efforts is that they think
  clearly and write clearly on the topics brought

 forward in our stories we appreciate the senti-
 ment indicated by your view that not anything
 is impossible and the achievements of the last
 few decades have been so wonderful that they
 have almost destroyed our sense of astonishment

 as rewards the mailer of the world you
 will find that the end is very satisfactory and

 in time or permanency and it defines per-
 manency as duration tpe inability of one to
 define time well enough is proof of its nothing-
 ness-why trj to travel in nothing time is
 nothing in the last sense of the word it cannot
 be measured you can measure only the differ-
 ence between one moment and the other and

 will iiu llltil iijc ciu  vci	lllll wtnvvil nv	owv	viiuip

 you will nut know what it is until you rcach the that by using the difference between the marks

                                                    on a clock or watch

                                                   when you come down to ihc point nothing can
                                                   be measured except by the three known dimen-
                                                   sions a thermometer is read by how high up the
                                                   column of mercury is from zero not even mass
                                                   can be directly measured except in a few cases
                                                   and most of the time it is reckoned by its relation
                                                   to length height and breadth you tell weight

  concluding paragraph
  mr wells among his other merits as an au-
  thor has the faculty of giving what is called
  atmosphere this appears in pollock and the
  porroh man where there is an atmosphere of
  utter dreariness which is very impressive psy-
  chology plays an all-important part in this story

  science is interesting even if imaginative with-
  out imagination there would be few discoveries

three dimensions and four dimen-
sions-fundamental conceptions

  editor amazing stories

    as an interested reader of amazing stories i
  feel that i speak for the great majority of read-
  ers when i say that stories in which time is
  turned backward or forward are impossible
  time is something that cannot be tampered with
  all that is with us is the present the past has
  already gone and the future is yet to come

    authors realizing that a trip into the future
  or past would make an interesting story cast
  about for scientific means of accomplishing time-
  traveling finally one hit upon the idea of de-
  fining time as the fourth dimension and travelling
  in that then he gave a talk with flawless proofs
  that one should be able to travel in the fourth
  dimension as well as any other very convinc-
  ing but taking too much for granted is time
  the fourth dimension

    no it is not it is not a dimension any more
  than mass or weight is you may argue that a
  thing cannot exist without duration something
  that exists only instantaneously without exist-
  ing any time at all cannot be said to exist at
  all therefore time is needed and is a dimen-
  sion as surely as length height and width  but
  why pick only on time can a thing be said to
  exist without mass

    certainly not that is a foolish question be-
  cause something with the three dimensions has
  automatically mass there you are-something
  with the three dimensions has automatically
  time or duration

    our authors seem to have the wrong concep-
  tion of a dimension length height and width
  are dimensions-we can sec them and measure
  them you can point out no object that has
  other than these dimensions they are something
  tangible ina which it is possible to move then
  why bring in an abstract term-something which
  one cannot see or touch you cannot even talk
  about time intelligently much less define it
  the dictionary says that time is a measure of
  duration it defines duration as a continuance

  is pulling down on it everything comes bach
  to the three dimensions they arc the only
  thing it is possible to be in therefore the only
  things it is possible to move in an immaterial
  term cannot lie associated with a material body

  the fourth dimension idea seems to be the prin-
  cipal one used in time-traveling stories al-
  though in one the astounding discoveries of
  doctor mentiroso this man has a machine which
  travels faster than the earth he reasoned that
  if it were  a m in san francisco and he could
  travel instantaneously to new york it would be
  twelve at noon so he would go three hours into
  the future of coursc this type is not to he con-
  sidered and the only other time-traveling scheme
  is in connection with light waves reflected from
  the earth if you capture these away out in
  space the sccres will be re-enacted but this is no
  more traveling into the past than seeing moving
  pictures

  but i believe the best proof that time-traveling
  will never be attained is the absence of trav-
  ellers now the future beings do not come back
  to this era for we do not see them and as nu
  one has seen or talked with any it means that
  this ambition will never be realized if they
  recede in time at all they will come back in-
  definitely and we would see them what better
  proof would one need

  yes the average reader realizes that time-
  traveling stories arc a lot of bunk and 
  think that you will agree with me that he docs

  i hope i have made myself clear in this letter
  and i thank you for  the opportunity of being
  able to express my opinions in the magazine

  the subject of dimensions has received very
  extensive application in physics and all the
  physical units have been referred to and based
  methodically upon the fundamental dimensions
  or units those of time length and mass and
  now in the midst of this which has led to a very
  interesting working out of the units mechanic-
  ally and physically there appears the fourth
  dimension and the effect seems to be occa-
  sioning considerable confusion

  we want to say about this letter what we
  said about others that it is so well pul that
  comment is unnecessary it is interesting read-

a wreath for dr david h keller

 cditor amazing stories

i want to tell you how very much i enjoyed
the story in your magazine for february by ur
david ii keller the revolt of the pedes-
trians it is far the most interesting story i
have read it is so different-so very amazing
it certainly gives this generation much to think
about many of the girls here have read the
story and all of them liked it so well we de-
cided to write to you and ask you to request the
author to write more of that type  we will be
looking forward to more of his stories

                          florinc e blount

                           fort worth tex
dr kellers way of pushing to an ultimate
conclusion the effect of the automobile on man
may do considerable good inspiring people with
the idea that exercise is excellent for the body
which of course everybody knows but which
people seem to have forgotten as far as walking
is concerned

   the beauty of walking is that when properly
done and in good form the whole body is in-
volved in the process and the mechanical per-
fection of a long-distance walker as indicated
by his gait is most interesting the question
of how to walk has received much study by mili-
tary authorities as for instance straight-leg
walking proper length of step miles per hour
and other details the care of the foot the
preservation of the arch the proper shape of the
soldiers shoe have been made the subject of a
very interesting monograph by an army officer
and in the revolt of the pedestrians the
human foot and leg are pictured as atrophied and
pedestrianism is featured as a sort of disgrace

   theres a lot of morality in dr kellers story
 -editor

an encouraging and appreciative
letter

 editor amazing stories

   i have been an enthusiastic follower and booster
 of amazing stories since its first issue but this
 is the first time t have had the inspiration to
 break forth into the public limelight so here goes
 short and to the point

   i heartily endorse the suggestion made by one
 of my fellow readers as to the forming of an
 international science club with amazing stories
 its official organ i think international science
 club would he a much better name than young
 mens science club if that name doesnt conflict
 with existing organizations i am sure none of
 us would object to a small fee for membership to
 pay for membership cards enrollment etc then
 amazing stories could devote a page to scientific
 discussions and matters pertaining to the club
 lets go

   here are a few other suggestions which i am
sure will appeal to many regarding the present
form of the magazine you have already promised
us better quality paper so i will pass that over i
notice that the word scient fiction docs not
appear on the covr of the magazine at all now
 think that is a sad omission because there are
many that are not familiar with amazing stories
and imagine it is a concoction of weird eerie hair-
raising thrillers instead of a delightful set of
stories based on scientific knowledge and fact i
am sure the latter impression is the one most de-
sirable to cultivate y all means do not consider
doing away with either the editorial page or with
the discussions and the comments i would also
suggest a page devoted to jokes of a scientific
nature similar to the one conducted in science
and invention

    will not commit myself as to which stories i
 like or dislike as that is a matter of personal
 opinion the sooner the readers realize this and
 stop panning this story or that the better they
 will enjoy the magazine and will not tire the
 patience of the other discussions readers by
 their i like this i think that was rotten
 etc and then read in the next letter exactly the
 opposite opinion

   i hope i havent tired you with all this chatter
 and hope  have done my bit to make amazing
 stories what we all want it to lie

                         benjamin domingo

                           harvard street
                                medford mass

   you will find in these discussion columns vari-
 ous letters dealing with the cliili question which
 wc assure you you will read with interest but as
 we said before our readers must get up the club
 and do the organizing and they will have the ad-
 vantage of having an organ which from its own
 viewpoint will warmly espouse the cause

   you will understand that the object of the dis-
 cussions column is precisely to let our readers
 know what is thought of the magazine by others
 we make no effort to exclude unfavorable criticism
 but are glad to put it in although wc may entirely
 disagree with it your point of view expressed in
 the next to the last paragraph of your letter
 however just cannot be made a criterion for select-
 ing letters to be printed wc want our readers to
 understand that unfavorable criticisms are printed
 in these columns without hesitation

   the better quality paper we hope will soon be
 realized for amazing stories-as soon as the
 magazine has been put on a paying basis

   your suggestion to have the word scientifiction
 appear on the front cover is an excellent one and
 has been suggested by a number of other readers
 our art department has not been able to fit it on
 the cover though without crowding it but it
 may be done in the near future-editor

friendly criticisms from england

editor amazing stories

it is unnecessary for me to say that i like vour
magazine because if i did not i would not buv
it every month	

i have however one or two criticisms to make

i cannot force myself to swallow any fourth
dimension-time-traveling story yet bccause it is
absurd

quite a number of people have proved con-
clusively that you cannot travel in time because
if you did you would not sec your real past or
at least the people in the past would not see
you also you in the present cannot see the
future because it has not yet happened-and wc
are not optimists who think everything is writ-
ten and ended that all science is in the books

the earih travels around the sun and the
sun is rushing through spacc at a bigb speed
we know this and yet such writers as h g
wells tell us that although they go back in time
without altering their position their real posi-
tion they find the earth a thousand years ago
in the same place as it is today or rather note

supposing you could go back in time you
would find that the earth has not readied you
yet and will not until you reach your original
present in which you were a few minutes ago
but which ts iikv in the future

i cannot see the necessity of having in rices
ray a vacuum between the walls of the ma-
chine when they have millions of miles of
vacuum outside

we know of the tremendous electric storms
that occur on the sun constantly then why
were not rice and his companions electrocuted
on directing the ray towards the sun

 mr rice stales that the revolution of venus
is of about  hours duration schiaparelli how-
ever has taken its day equal to its year
 of our days and this i think is now taken
as correct

 have read practically all vernes and wells
books and i susrgest that you should publish
men iike gods some lime or other

 will not say anything against dr mentiroso
except that a circle has two dimensions but as
they are identical in length it is convenient
to consider one only

it is true that some people have very little
imagination but still i wish the inhabitants of
mars venus or a comet would not icavj have
a head on top a body underneath and the arms
and legs at the same place as we have them
that is the reason why  liked the men from
the pit and similar stories

i dont like prehistoric stories as a story
of the stone age and  wish gravity nullifiers
screens and rays were explained in a more
scientific and fuller way

                               r a eadcs

                           petersboro road

richmond surrey england

p s do you publish all letters in the dis-
cussions

p s  please do not tell me that it is inter-
esting how these stories make me think

this letter is so complete that wc have little
to say about it

the time you give for the rotation of the
planet venus is generally accepted as pretty
nearly correct but it is more or less uncertain

our authors have a great way of modifying
human traits which may be taken as belonging
to planetary brothers you see the development
of the human system along curious lines which
the author may select goes to tell the story of
his future changes and of the development
which some believe is impending for mankind
in the direction of the enlargement of the intel-
lectual element in his nature but unfortu-
nately some people think it is the other way
and that man is evoluting downwards cer-
tainly the great war at the acme of our civi-
lization- and the possibility if not probability
of any such contest impending in the near
future are sad reflections on human evolution
sometimes it looks as though the universe was
definite- going in the wrong direction

we publish only those letters in these columns
that are of interest to the majority it is im-
possible to print all letters-editor

the comet doom and what should
happen to the earth

editor amazing stories

last month i enoyed the comet doom im-
mensely there is only one point that  am un-
certain about the author states that after being
led out of its orbit the earth slowly returned to
its path around the sun this is not true fnr
if the earth should slow up as stated in the
story it would lose part of its centrifugal force
and hie gravitation of the sun would pull at it
with such tremendous power that the earth would
plunge into that heavenly body even if the
earth had been stopped the least bit the suns
gravity would pull the earth so near that lumin-
ous body that life on the earth would be im-
possible on account of the great heat i would be
very much pleased if you would correct me in
any of my statements	edmund perks

                            new york n y
the comet doom may be taken as correct ill
principle but altogether incorrect in magnitude

it would be hard to imagine a moon capable of
causing cosmic disturbance affecting our earth
without occasioning the ruin or destruction of all
living creatures so you must forgive our author
if he tries to spare our globe from total ruin-

plans flight to the moon

machine capable of  miles a minute
needed for fantastic hop

      miami fla dec  up-the most
    fantastic project ever devised a flight to
    the planet venus millions of miles away
    was announced today

     the man who proposed to make jules
   vernes trip to the moon look like childs
   play is robert condit of condit ohio
   an obscure chemist and engineer 

with intense earnestness hr insisted

       i	t   -  

  at the workshop where he is assembling
  his invention that the trip is feasible
  the motive power for the machine he

     said to be used through the earths
     atmosphere for the first  or  miles will
     be principally from a slow explosive de-
     rived from the most powerful alkali known
     -peroxide of sodium-used as a direct
     propeller

     after leaving the earths atmosphere
     the propelling power will be a network of
     units capable of being polarized with the
     attraction of other planets and orbits of
     meteor streams other than the earths
     the necessary maximum speed for such a
     flight would oc  miles a minute

     condit about  and an ex-service man
     arrived here a week ago and began the
     construction of a building resembling an
     airplane hangar at the surfs edge next
     he built about it a board fence six feet
     high

     he refused to discuss more secret details
     of his experiment although he apparently
     has adequate financial backing lie will
     not be ready for his attempt liclorc jan 

     the cutting must speak for itself and we give
 it to show that the impossible stories of inter-
 planetary travel which wc publish are to lie
 found duplicated sometimes in the news of the
 day but mr condit is either a very imaginative
 person-or perhaps unimaginative lie hardly
 will go to the moon wc use the term duplicated
 -mr condit will not duplicate our stories of
 interplanetary or of intcrsatcllitc travel

     appreciation from our younger readers is al-
 ways welcome their criticism is sincere and
 often acute-editor

a staunch supporter of amazing
stories

  editor amazing stories

    the reason i am writing is to bring to your notice
  the enclosed cutting describing a mcchanical mail
  which follows the orders of a human voice i
  remember reading about a mechanical body for
  n man in the man with the queer head a
  story where the author seems to touch upon imagina-
  tive things here is a mechanical man that goes
  him one better it is a cutting from a new york
  daily another example of your motto extrava-
  gant fiction today-cold fact tomorrow 
  enjoy all the stories printed in your magazine  i
  would like to have some more mad planet stories
  and the sequel to the face in the abyss i am
  for a semi annual with complete stories also for
  semi-monthly publication with more illustrations
  such as you had ill the master mind of mars

    i hope his cutting is something you havent
  heard of before i am a staunch supporter of

mechanical man follows orders
of human voice

     the mechanical man a machine which re-
   sponds in action to the human voice has been
   perfected and put into operation by engineers
   of the westinghouse electric and manufacturing
   company ii was announced last night

      the so-called electric men when addressed in
    the proper tones will reply by means of sound
    waves within the human voice register giving
    correct information and carrying out various
    orders

      at n demonstration given yesterday at the
    offices of the westinghouse company 
    broadway on the first syllabic transmitted to
    one of these elcciric workers a series of lights
    were lit at the second syllable the automaton
    started an electric fan a searchlight was
    turned on by a third syllable at a fourth it
    operated an automatic sweeper a fifth syllable
    was pronounced and the mechanical man started
    a signal lamp

     the automaton responds only to sound it
   must be ordered in just the prccise tone it
   works with amazing speed

   the mechanical man as the imaginative re-
 porter terms it responds to sounds of exactly accu-
 rate pitch it is set to do this and the sounds are
 produced mechanically and  electrically it does
 not respond to the mere voice-the human organs
 cannot give the requisite notes it is very fully
 described in the tanuary issue of science and in-
 vention-fditol

the atomic picture of the universe

 editor amazing stories

 i am morc interested in amazing stories
 than in any fiction magazine published to me
 the most amazing idea is that of the edge ol
 space by ray cummings in around the uni-
 verse  it the atom is ether surrounded by a shell
 of matter it is possible even probable that the
 macrocosmic spaces are also and that we are
 living in a stupendous atom your writers some
 of them are coming very near the inner secrets
 of the cosmos	grace pearl bronaugh

oxnard calif

 the idea of the edge of space is quite inter-
 esting and the many shells ranging from atoms
 up to the cosmos certainly give a strange aspect
 of the universe docs it not sometimes seem that
 man instead of increasing the sum of his knowl-
 edge only increases his realization of how little
 he does know our ignorance should impress us
 as a palling and some of the wildest flights of
 our imagination may approximate to future mat-
 ter of fact

 space has long been one of the mysteries of
 the world in the older philosophies it was much
 discussed with little satisfactory result the idea
 ot space being curved and returning into itself
 does not satisfy the intellect-editor

criticism from a high school
student

 editor amazing stories

  have been a reader of amazing storifs since
 the iirst issue which i believe was april 
 i have enjoyed every issue immensely and have

 raised the magazine to the sky to all my friends
 t is surprising to me how few people are inter-
 ested in scienti fiction or even in scientific de-
 velopments of modern times i am a senior in
 high school and of all my friends whom  have
 tried to get interested in your magazine i have
 succeeded with only four or five of course
 these facts do not serve to show that amazing
 -stories is not popular it merely serves to point
 out the fact that so few people in the teen
 age are interested in science however it
 turns out to be true that those who are inter-
 ested from the first in this sort of reading
 become most ardent perusers afterwards i am
 looking forward to amazing stories to instill
 into the minds of some of these uninterested
 people the expansion of modern sciences mar-
 vels into greater marvels of future years

 perhaps you the editor of an adult maga-
 zine will net listen to the criticisms of a mere
 high school student but as i see it the present
 high school student is fairly capable of discus-
 sing science topics of today and tomorrow with
 considerable knowledge sained from the studies of
 high school science

 as to my criticism of the magazine i have
 only a few to make i will list them in a man-
 ner winch is easier to read

 	the stories all satisfy me each author
 has his own particular style which gives variety
 and change

 	the drawings arc certainly not artfully
 drawn but they satisfy me i would not mind
 seeing more of them

 	the bindings certainly are weak for the
 preservation of the magazines and i would fike
 to see better ones  realize though the cost
 of better ones i have devised a way of affix-
 ing cardboard covers on my issues which make
 them much stronger for keeping and reading them
 over

 	after reading your announcement in the
 february issue of amazing stories about the
 quarterly i wish to state that it sounds very-
 good to me

 	the quality of amazing stories paper fully
 satisfies me i do not mind it being rough
 as it is as long as the ink from the printing
 does not blot in places and as long as the paper
 docs not easily tear

 as i used io occasionally read science ano
 invention i used to notice some of ray cum-
 mings serials which looked very good to me i
 wish you could consider reprinting them in
 amazing stories

 i cannot think of any special criticism to
 separate stories as i can truthfully say that i
 have enjoyed every one of them i shall be
 satisfied with similar ones any time

james shepard klar

ii dartmouth street springfield mass

 we have said  over and over again that we
 appreciate the criticisms of the vounger minds
 because of the fact that the adult mind is apt
 to think in grooves so when we say that wc
 enjoy criticisms from the young wespeak the
 truth

 you must remember that the drawings for
 our stories require peculiar treatment by the
 artist the artist has to have a scientific and
 mechanical feeling in his work and mr paul
 is pre-eminently good in this line

 rough surface paper is good for the eyes the
 extensive use of half-tones in some other maga-
 zines has brought about the use of glossy paper
 which is most disagreeable for the reader

 as regards reprinting stories from science ano
 invkntion this is something wc cannot do too
 freely many of our readers are old time friends
 of s ikncf and invention and we have to think
 of them but we feel that it is a practice which
 we can very well carry out occasionally-

a list of preferred stories-
who was baron muenchhausen

  editor amazing stories

  after having read the february issue of
  amazing stories i wish to state tny preference
  of the stories here it is in order lhe revolt
  of the pedestrians pollock and the porroh
  man baron munchhausens scientific adven-
  tures four dimensional surgery the
  fighting heart the disintegrating ray
  the fourteenth earth smoke kings

  i do not wish to forget the poems by leland
  s copeland they are very interesting and
  serve as food for thought

  in regard to baron munchhausen i find in the
  stratford edition of his travels published by lhe
  f m lupton publishing co new york no
  dale given the following

  in fact recent investigation has rendered
  it almost a certainty that the original author of
  munchhausens travels was a learned but un-
  principled scholar of the name of r e raspe
  who had taken refuge in this country from the
  pursuit of justice vide gentlemans magasine jan-
  uary  and that many of his stories are of
  ancient date and current in various countries
  many are to be found under the title of men-
  dacia ridicula in volume  of deliciae aca-
  demicae ileilhron  that of sound being
  frozen in a post-horn is from rabelais appears
  to have been known also in spain and italy and
  is said by a writer in notes and queries no
    to be traceable to one of the later greek
  writers from whom jeremy taylor in one of
  his sermons borrows it as an illustration while
  lhe story of lhe horse cut in two by the por-
  cullis is translated by lady c guest in the
  mabinogion from an ancient welsh manuscript
  in line with mr ostranders suggestion i
  would like to see edgar allan poes story the
  thousand-and-second talc of scheherazade
  printed in amazing stories

i am not in favor of having a semi-monthly
magazine but think the quarterly is excellent

                               earle floathe

                walnut st pendleton ore
  we arc glad to get the list of the stories which
  you prefer in the order of preference we arc
  very glad to note that pollock and the porroh
  man is in a high position because the story im-
  pressed its veiy vividly with a sense of horror
  as it might be expressed and it certainly de-
  velops a fine line of hypnotic effects and
  impressions

  the temperature of the tropic world is very
  well given and it is in the production of at-
  mosphere that mr wells particularly excels it
  will be of interest to note that he is a gradu-
  ate with honor in zoology

  your notes on baron munchhausen are very
  interesting and go to carry out the proverb that
  there is nothing new under the sun

  were glad to tell you that edgar allan poes
  story the thousand and-second talc of schehera-
  zade is to have an early publication in amazing
  stories-editor

the annual and quarterly-
wells and verne

  editor amazing stories

  february number just here today what is
  the matter with the magazine lately have
  noticed during the last few months that it seems
  to be coming later and later

  congratulate you on your decision to publish
  a quarterly in addition to the monthly only
  kick i have refers to the reprints the annual
  was about half spoiled by reprints at least give
  us the quarterly of new stuff i like h g wells
  and when the sleeper wakes is a good story
  but i cant get nearly as much kick out of reading
  it again as i could out of some story i had never
  seen

  another suggestion that incidentally backs up
  one which i read some months ago in the section
  used for discussions if the present conditions
  do not permit publishing much but reprints why
  not scatter your stories a trifle morc and not
  give us so much of wells verne and others
  jules verne and wells edition after edition i
  like wells fairly well but verne is terrible
  indoubtedly he has an imagination and pruphe-
  cied amazingly for his time and period but
  outside of his ability to describe well and his
  gift of imagination he is a very dim bulb his
  frycollin in that last atrocity robur the
  conqueror would make a horse laugh you
  cant expect a dyed-in-the-wool frenchman to
  have an anglo-saxon sense of humor and car-
  rolesquc anglo saxon altitude the characters
  strike me as pathetic almost as bad as the
  slapstick humor in the funny  stories you
  have been running

  almost missed the second instalment of that
  particular tale-passed it up until i had to buy
  it because i wanted something to read and
  couldnt seem to see anything else the rest of
  it was very good even if  had read wells
  the stolen body umpteen times in various
  magazines and hooks

  mr middletons rather lengthy letter was in-
  teresting though i cannot wholly agree with
  him especially in his criticism of the war of
  the worlds the narrator was not very much
  concerned with what the rest of england was
  doing he was simply telling what befell him
  and those with whom he was intimately con-
  nected the rest was a dream of noises more
  or less and probably mr middleton if placed
  in a like position today would not pause to
  get a copy of the examiner or consult the boston
  globe as to what someone else thought he would
  be making tracks as far apart as possible as
  for gas masks and planes and all our modern

they make

 it is not the editors fault if amazing stories
 is slow about getting to maine we are glad
 to know howcver that you do not like to have
 it delayed even

 one of the perplexities of an editor is cer-
 tainly to please the greatest number of readers
 ttie flood of letters which we receive give all
 sorls of views concerning our writers work

 ii	g wells is perhaps the most discussed author
 his stories exciting the dislike of some people
 and eliciting praise from others some people
 directly ask fur reprints as from science and
 invention and others object to reprints you
 do not like jules verne who made an immense
 reputation and whose wild extravaganzas have
 in many cases proved the fore-runners of mans
 everyday achievements of late years- is not
 the fact that jules vernes stories have been
 put upon the film and have won great success
 with the audiences a tribute to their merit

 the idea of the discussions column and what
 we wish to be a prominent feature of it is the
 publication of unfavorable as well as favorable
 letters the unfavorable criticisms arc in many
 cases useful guides but it is really a puzzle to
 know what to do when a controversy  exists
 about a particular author and is carried on
 energetically on both sides ask yourself what
 would you do if you were in our place

  the funny stories to which you object have
 impressed us and many others very favorably
 do you not think that if you had a little more
 anglo-saxon humor as you call it in your
 composition that you would appreciate them
 more you like alice in wonderland and in
 the looking glass we know that we enjoy
 the funny stories you dislike and it is hard
 to believe that the things which so impressed
 one did not impress another at all-editor

a welcome to the quarterly-
what is sound

 editor amazing stories

 ive been reading amazing stories for a very
 long time and i run well pleased to hear about
 the quarterly

 i find your stories very exciting and in fact
 when  start in read the book if it isnt loo
 late-why ill sit down and read the whole book
 in a few hours time

 your stories really grip and when you start
 to read them you cant let go

 theres a question t would like to ask you
 a very puzzling question which got me into many
 quarrels with my friends

 the question is-noise is made by the ear
 am i not right

 now then suppose a -calibre pistol was fired
 off way out in the woods by means of a string
 or something else and there wasnt anything
 around to hear it

 did it make a noise i brought this subject
 up to my friends and when i said it didnt make
 a noise they all laughed at me

 now here is my point of view-if noise is
 made by the ear and nobody around  hear it
 of course it didnt make a noise

 ive heard noise is only vibrations which the
 ear transforms to sound

 now take a deaf man-a gun is fired the sound
 vibrations are there but his ears wont make
 sound and of course he cant hear it the same
 with the gun out in the woods am i not right

 i am hoping i will sec this question answered
 in your next edition of amazing stories as it
 has caused me very much confusion with my
 friends

     i liked your story of the comcl doom in your
 january edition and i found it so very inter-
 esting i read the story three times

                              arthur white

 bank st curti ohio

 evhether the pistol fired in the desert of
 ara would maxe a noise or not is a matter
 of definition-a question of the subjective and
 the objective the subjective definition of noise
 would be wc suppose vibrations of air affecting
 the auditory nerves a good objective one would
 be vibrations of air within the range of audition
 you sec the second definition does not include
 the idea of a hearer the question has been
 asked over and over again and has been dis-
 cussed to the point of weariness our general
 advice would be for you to treat it as a matter
 of definition and before attempting to argue
 about it to gel an authoritative statement ot
 what class of noise you are to speak about
 websters dictionary gives two definitions of
 sound which correspond closely to the subjective
 and objective definitions of noise given above
 so if the pistol was fired by a time fuse or
 otherwise so that nobody could hear it we might
 call that objective sound if it was heard it
 would be subjective sound but do not say
 that the ear makes sound-editor

an admirer of h g wfli-s gives his
views on time travel

liditor amazing stories

after having read your magazine regularly for
over a year i am lending you for the first time
my reader vote of preference and a few re-
marks

i have been reading your discussions dc-

iiartmcnt aud have noted with surprise the nuni-
icr of people who do not like the stories of ii 
wells when as a matter of fact there is no
writer in the scicntiliction field with a more ab-
sorbing style or with more imagination and origi-
nality mis tendency to detail and his keenness
of observation only testify to the greatness of
his marvelous mind it is my opinion that the
people who dislike his work are usually of the
kind whose idea of a good -lory is a hectic melo-
drama glorifying action-preferably absurd action
-and without a single worthwhile thought to
commend it to the intelligent reader

i should like to add a word to the time travel
discussion which the astounding discoveries
of doctor mentiroso and the time machine
seem toltave started the incredible thing about
traveling in time seems to me to be the indefinite
extension of the span of life of any human being
undertaking a time journey in the tune ma-
chine mr wells projects himself so far into
the future that jie sees the world stationary with
one face always toward the sun and yet he
lives when logically he should have killed
himself at the very start by passing the par-
ticular period in lime when his death would
naturally have occurred

i	am twenty-six years of age i may live to
lie seventy-six iet us suppose that a time ma-
chine could be invented which would enable me
to travel tifty years into the future i would
then be seventy-six if  traveled farther i
should die and be automatically incapacitated
for further travel in time-or space if my con-
sciousness could live on and continue traveling
after the death of my body it is possible that

	could reach that far-distant time of which
wells tells but i would not then have any such
adventures as those of which he tells were i
on the other hand to travel into the past i
could only travel to tli- extent of twenty-six
years did  travel farther than that  should
be unborn-non-existent-and again incapable of
further travel if i cut my travels snort after
say twenty years of paslward progress i
should undoubtedly see things as they were
twenty years ago but by the same token i should
see them with the eyes of a six-year-old child
is not that self-evident

however by all means continue giving us
such stories even though they may be impos-
sible they are tremendously interesting and
do not cut down our rations of wells give us
more if anything

snch objections as those which mr butler of
taft california advances against the war of
the worlds seem to me childish he speaks of
the impossibility of slugs or mice developing in-
telligence and cites as proof the fact that the
human race has outstripped such creatures on
earth if i understand wells however one of
the things he most desires to make plain is
that other forms may have developed our own
dominant characteristics mentally speaking on
other worlds in fact that this is more likely
than not	jofin a stahlherg

outlook montana

what you say about time travel is so well
put that it shuts out any criticism by us no
comment seems necessary

you will have noticed in all of mr wells
marie in which animal life plays a part that
there breathes through it a suggestion of reality
or possibility however extravagant it may ap-
pear-editor

a good sequel to smoke rings

edilor amazing storifs

talk about some of the stories in amazing
storifs magazine coming true in the near future
in the february  issue of the above maga-
zine there was a story entitled smoke rings
by george mclociard in this story it mentions
tlie destruction of a dirigible through the aid
of these smoke rings well the other day while
reading the chicago daily tribune i came across
the enclosed article read it mid be convinced
keep up the good work let us have plenty of

danes claim invention

      to knock out war planes
   chicago tribune press service
   copenhagen jan -a sensational
   danish invention was revealed today
   which it is believed may eliminate air
   wars the rotating poison gas typhoon
   the title of the invention is claimed by a
   special artillery tornado of ga to be able
   to be hurled at airplanes putting them out
   of commission and rendering the pilots
   helpless

    the alleged danish invention to a certain ex-
tent carries out the idea of smoke rings
smoke rings have been found by experiment to
lie very wonderful things and they have even
been taken by leading scientists as giving the
representation of the atom but this point of
view has been upset by the modern conception
of the planetary atom for the smoke ring has no
central nucleus no representatives of protons
although the ring may in a way suggest plane-
