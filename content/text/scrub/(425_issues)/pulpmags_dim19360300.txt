 thumb-nail sketches
 of dime mystery authors

no  arthur j burks

arthur j burks who has con-
tributed his engrossing tales of
mystery and terror to this maga-
zine for many years is marvelously well
equipped through experience and back-
ground to present the eerie and weird
aspects of life on this planet in their
proper setting during his travels which
have been extensive he has encountered
individuals and witnessed scenes that he
admits in all frankness have him stumped
to account for logically ranging up and
down the west indies he has seen sights
that beggar even his remarkable powers of
description-but it was these experiences
in a large measure that diverted him from
a military career into the field of writing

  although now only thirty-seven burks
saw eleven years service with the marine
corps enlisting in  and receiving his
honorable discharge in  he ad-
vanced rapidly through the non-commis-
sioned grades from private to aide-de-
camp to general smedley d butler he
was stationed in santo domingo for two
and one-half years doing topographical
and intelligence work he has visited
haiti cuba panama nicaragua mexico
hawaii philippines formosa china
manchuria korea and japan

  his wide knowledge of these places
and his acquaintances throughout the
globe have furnished him with rich re-
sources from which to draw the color and
atmosphere for his stories who of those
who have read his tales set in the west
indies in china-or any of the other
multitudinous locales he has used-could
doubt the authenticity of the background
or the sure authority of the writer but
this is not so much due to the fact that
burks actually visited those places as to
his ability to take authentic raw materials
and inject into them that vivid breathing
life without which no amount of actual
experience can enable a writer to carry
conviction over to his readers

burks background as a writer is as
rich and colorful as his experience of life
he has written for a total of one hundred
and forty magazines he has had pub-

     thats the way to bring about healthy kidney
     activity and stop that bladder irritation which
     often causes scanty passage with smarting and
     burning as well as restless nights

     remember the kidneys often need flushing
     as well as the bowels and some symptoms of
     kidney weakness are getting up once or twice

     during the night-puffy eyes-cramps in leg
backache and moist palms but be sure and get
gold medal haarlem oil capsules-the

 original and genuine-right from haarlem

  those who have read books dealing with

about the authenticity of the events de-
scribed therein burks stands as a witness
that most of it is true he has seen voo-

he relates gives a clue to the quality of
experience to be met with in those sultry
climes whose secrets no white man has
ever plumbed it was while he was in
charge of a prison in santo domingo
under him was a native haitian who held
the post because of his influence over the
prisoners of his own race both burks
and the haitian had been away one after-
noon in order to take charge of a ship-
ment of prisoners sent from one of the
small islands when they returned they
found that a member of the local gendar-
merie had jailed a couple of haitians-
and the haitians had promptly dug them-
selves out of prison hearing of the inci-
dent burks native aide smiled quietly
before dawn he said they will re-
turn  the aide did not know the escaped
prisoners he heard of the incident only
at the same time that burks heard of it-

by frederick c davis

author of the smiling killer etc

it was the rabid passion of a great cat that glared at her out of the stone-
cutters eyes but more than his evil lust-more even than his weird
hypnotic power over her-claire forester feared the heavy fabulously
strong hands that shaped cruel necklaces for the dying   

she was afraid-but she did not know	dark in the quiet and in her own laughter

what it was she feared it was	-yet it was nowhere strive as she might

nothing yet it was a dread that	she could find no reason for the terror

haunted her every waking hour it was	she felt-but she was afraid

everywhere-in the sunshine and in the	claire forester gazed at her cat he


was sitting at her feet bushy tail curled
a magnificent grey persian with luminous
yellow eyes she had acquired him as a
tiny blind kitten and he had been with
her ever since-a companion a confidant
a being she loved yet since they had come
to this house to live he seemed changed
the shining inscrutable eyes of marco

polo were directed at her now-a gaze
that was somehow ominous

  as she took him into her arms he an-
swered with a friendly purr though he
seemed unwilling and discontented do
you feel it too marco she asked in
a whisper is there something making
you uneasy would you like to go away




dime mytery magazine

the cats amber eyes looked into hers
while he sang i think you know-

  she told herself it was all nonsense
here she was wearing an old sweater and
a tweed skirt snug woolen stockings and
oxfords scuffed from long walks through
the connecticut hills-a sensible sane
young woman she was twenty-two self-
reliant thoroughly and happily married
everything about herself everything
around her was so real of course

  there was jim the man she loved stal-
wart and handsome puffing away at his
old calabash working with square and
pen at his drawing-board he was com-
puting specifications skeining out lines
that would some day become the stone
and steel of an impressive building noth-
ing was worrying him they didnt have
much money and it wasnt easy to man-
age and of course he was concerned about
that-but he wasnt worrying about any-
thing else

  and there was bob baird claires
younger brother slumped in an easy chair
near the fireplace absorbed in a magazine
-a fine chap hard-headed and genuine
he was a chemist in the laboratory of a
proprietary drug manufacturer and there-
fore a realist-more than that a born de-
bunker who enjoyed exploding false be-
liefs certainly bob felt none of this
weird fear that had seized claire

  but she could never free herself of it
for more than a few minutes and in-
evitably it came back trickling into her
quickening heart like chill water

tim she said suddenly-and the

   anxiety ringing in her voice made the
cat cease purring dont you feel some-
thing strange about this house  dont you
bob somehow dont you sense that-
that something horrible is about to hap-
pen 

  jim forester looked up pen poised
eyes crinkling in a smile ill tell you
whats going to happen in about an hour

im going to quit work have a night-cap
go to bed and sleep the sleep of the in-
nocent maybe youre too used to the
jangle of the city sweet-the peace and
quiet here are giving you the jitters youll
get used to it soon

  bob baird tossed his magazine aside
something else is going to happen right
now im going to take a walk you
mustnt let this thing get you claire
how about tramping back to the quarry
with me-make you feel better

  claire said earnestly im not just be-
ing silly you know im not like that
there is something here   though the
dread persisted in her heart she laughed
you run along bob and jim you keep
right on working if you wont listen to
me ill find someone else ive an idea
maybe hugo cliffe can tell me what im
afraid of

  the cat seemed to sense her decision
before she made it-he bounded from her
lap landing soundlessly on padded paws
he looked back with his wise yellow eyes
and drifted toward the kitchen jim and
bob watched claire amusedly as she got
into her leather jacket and perky felt hat
see you later gentlemen she tossed at
them and went out

  when she reached the tar road at the
end of the dirt path she paused to look
at the house curiously it was a cheerful
old place with craggy wooded hills piled
behind it a peaceful retreat miles from
elmsford and more than two hours from
new york-claire and bob had inherited
it from their father and his brother the
spreading suburbanizing influence of the
city had not yet reached it and the main
lines of travel had left it untouched its
brooding tranquillity was a delight yet
somehow the quiet was fraught with the
nameless terror which claire forester
could not elude

  she could not forget that barnett and
gaylord baird her father and uncle had
necklace for the dying



died in that hous-mysteriously hor-
ribly 

  the dark deserted road led her to
the ramshackle dwelling on the adjoining
property its windows streamed white
light a granite monument sat near its
entrance neatly engraved hugo cliffe
craftsman in stone a bright shaft was
issuing from the open door of the shed
behind the house and as claire approached
it she heard the ringing tap-tap of a ham-
mer and chisel hugo cliffe was at work

  she had watched him wrestle single-
handed huge blocks of granite from the
quarry on her property and had marvelled
at his strength he was past sixty now
and all his life he had worked in stone
making doorsteps and gate-posts and
monuments as his father had before him
the hands of the cliffes had marked the
graves of all the neighborhoods dead dur-
ing decades past every time claire
forester passed hugo cliffes house she
heard the clanging of his busy chisel for
he labored with incredible tirelessness
day and night

  as she approached the workshop a
quick black movement on the ground
startled her an animal darted into the
light and paused warily turning gleaming
yellow eyes upon her-marco polo

rphe cat sped ahead as though drawn
by some desire stronger than her
friendship for him and vanished through
the door of the shed immediately the
rhythmic clicking ceased

  hugo cliffes voice came-a soft
throaty sound puzzled the girl looked
into the shed its floor was a white pack-
ing of stone chips its walls were pow-
dered with white stone dust monuments
sat against the walls their shining sur-
faces blank waiting for cliffes chisel to
inscribe names upon them-waiting for
the coming of death the stone-worker

was sitting on his bench his tools put
aside fondling the cat

  he was speaking in a peculiar purring
tone as though the animal could under-
stand him with human intelligence the
cat was looking intently into cliffes eyes
answering him with a high-pitched mew-
ing to the amazed girl they seemed to
be carrying on a conversation-the cat
and the man she started when he looked
up suddenly and saw her in the light for
she noted something then she had not
realized before-that hugo cliffes eyes
were like a cats

 good evening  come in mrs
forester

  his eyes-amber with elongated pupils
-like a cats they had the same inscru-
tible intensity as marco polos-but the
girl scolded herself for being alarmed
she knew the reason for the striking re-
semblance of cliffes eyes to a felines-
twice he had undergone operations for
cataract and each time a particle of iris
had been removed by the surgeons knife
this man she told herself was the con-
fidant of the countryside-her friend she
went in with hand cordially extended

  im glad youve come he said-his
voice was still soft but now it lacked the
strange purring quality ive taken three
blocks of stone from your quarry this
past week i owe you for it heres the
money it is satisfactory to you-the ar-
rangement i made with your father before
he-died 

  with a smile claire accepted the three
small banknotes which cliffe fumbled out
of his dusty overalls of course it is
she answered i want to talk with you
because im worried-i dont know why
perhaps youll laugh at me like jim and
bob for being afraid of something i cant
put my finger on-but i am afraid i dread
to close my eyes and sleep because   

  she broke off a strange chill stirring
her heart gazing at the cat marco polo


dime mystery meigazine

was rubbing himself against cliffes an-
kles purring ecstatically writhing back
and forth-consumed with an almost ob-
scene pleasure claire sensed again the
strange evil kinship that seemed to exist
between the animal and the man and an
irrepressible shudder passed over her she
watched the cat with a terrified fascina-
tion almost unaware of cliffes throaty
voice

  you are afraid you told your hus-
band i felt it the moment i stepped
through the door he doesnt understand
-but i know your deepest feelings i
know every thought that passes through
your mind you were alone with him
when you told him that but i know-
because we are one-one being-you and
i  

tter widened eyes rose to the feline
eyes of cliflfe she stood stock-still
chilled overwhelmed by the intense power
of his gaze the superhuman strength of
his muscles was puny compared with the
force she felt enwrapping her merely be-
cause he was looking at her in his face
she saw desire-lust-a consuming hunger
that fixed itself inescapably upon her she
could not take even one recoiling step
while his dusty voracious hands rose

   suddenly she was fighting his sinewy
arms were squeezing around her his dusty
lips were striving for hers his fingers
dug like talons his close-pressed body
wove with a feline suppleness as a sound
of desire came from his throat-a rasping
purr she felt the hopelessness of a
mouse trapped by deep-piercing claws as
she frantically struggled to escape breath-
lessly she tore back cringing from the
glare of his consuming amber eyes

  i thought-you were a friend-but
youre a fiend-a fiend

   she ran she flung herself from the
shop past the monument marked with
cliffes name along the black and deserted

road she fled from a dogging terror that
had suddenly materialized in an evil being
who was more of a cat than a man if he
was following her with swift feline agil-
ity his footfalls were making no sound
she stopped in a paralysis of exhaustion
at the entrance of her house widened eyes
searching the gloom at a sound her
breath came back because it meant hugo
cliffe was not stalking her

   it was the rhythmic tapping of a ham-
mer the ringing of a chisel biting into
stone   

chapter two

the chained death

che stood there a long time striving
to still the tumult of her heart
through the window she could see jim
working absorbed at the drawing-board-
his nearness reassured her she hesitated
to tell him what had happened because
already it seemed like a ghastly dream
because she knew jim would laugh and
protest that old hugo cliffe was incapable
of such an act yet the stone-workers
evil intensity had filled claire with a sense
of suffocation she could not fight down
he wants me he means to take me
the horror of that certainty kept her
mind in turmoil as she listened to the me-
tallic tapping suddenly the ringing beat
paused for long minutes there was
nothing but empty silence her fear ris-
ing the girl waited for it to come back
at last it returned far away echoing
strangely its direction had somehow
changed-it did not seem to be coming
from hugo cliffes workshop it issued
faintly from many points at once its
rhythm destroyed-and then again ab-
ruptly it ceased

   claire steadied herself as she opened
the entrance jim continuing his work
glanced up to ask well feeling any
necklaces for the dying



better she smiled bitterly because her
fear had increased a hundredfold but she
fought the impulse to blurt out the story
neither jim nor her brother would believe
her-she was quite sure of it she asked
as casually as she could

  wheres bob

  taking his walk

  claire went to jim quietly do you
remember she asked what i said last
night when we were getting ready for
bed-when we were talking about this
fear i feel

  jim answered as his pen scratched  i
felt it the moment i stepped through the
door-those were your exact words
yes claire repeated tensely yes-
my exact words we were alone when i
said that jim wereat we-completely
alone

  i hope we were jim said with a smile
you were wearing very little darling
but marco was there

 yes marco was-

  he heard it

  claires face was white jim saw the
haunting fear in her eyes and put down
his pen he gently took her cold hands
in his-she tried to keep them from trem-
bling he asked quietly what is it
sweet youre not ill your mind is per-
fectly clear theres absolutely nothing to
be afraid of what could happen here
i dont know i dont know jim but
something-something-

  it broke suddenly in the hush-a hack-
ing choking cry an inarticulate call
bursting out of the night-it brought
claire forester instantly to her feet foot-
falls were sounding outside ragged stum-
bling the strangling voice shouted again
this time high-pitched torn with terror
abruptly there was a crash at the entrance

  bob baird lurched in he tottered
weakly tearing at his throat with both
hands he turned a face of horror toward
his sister-bluish swollen his eyes pro-

truding starkly his tongue slavering out
over puffed lips he dropped to his knees
still clawing at his throat forcing out dis-
torted syllables

  take it off-take it off

laire hurried to him as he rolled
to the floor fighting desperately for
air that would not come robbed of his
last strength his fingernails had gouged
his neck-his skin was ripped and bleed-
ing claire seized his wrists tried to
force his arms away but she could not
jim crowded beside her as a sob broke
through her lips he fought bobs hands
down then they saw it-the chain

  the linked circle was banded deep into
bobs throat puffed flesh and gorged
blood-vessels almost concealed it the
scant air whistling through the stricken
young mans crushed windpipe was not
enough to support life his face was dis-
torted with ghastly suffering-he was dy-
ing all his desperate efforts had not
been enough to rid himself of the chok-
ing chain-and jim forester frantically
seeking an open link could find no means
of removing it

  the tools he urged claire bring
my cutters-anything god i cant get
it off

  she ran into the room adjoining the
kitchen where jim kept the tools he used
for odd jobs around the house it was
stored with accumulated odds and ends
this afternoon claire had seen the saw
hammer and pliers lying on the bench in
the corner she groped for them in the
dark too consumed with anxiety to think
of turning on the hanging light-but she
did not find them lips cold with anguish
she grabbed at the bulb turned the key
reached into the glare she stood frozen
with consternation because the tools were
not there

  horrible choking noises floated to her
as she looked around swiftly she did

not see the cutters she ran back along
the hall scarcely aware of the sound of
the opening door of a new voice speaking
the man who had come in was dr ellis
hunt who lived half a mile down the
road-she gave him only a quick unsee-
ing glance as she gripped jims shoulder

  i cant find them jim

  i left them on the bench-they must
be there good god-hes choking to
death

  jim sprang up rushed back to the
store-room bobs efforts to breathe had
become ghastly spasms dr hunt bent
over him striving somehow to detach the
crushing circle of chain but he could
not even bring it into his fingers because
that would tighten it around the choking
mans neck while clattering sounds came
from behind her-jim frantically search-
ing-claire stood stricken with helpless-
ness gazing transfixed at her brothers
blood-bloated face-watching him die

  your car she blurted suddenly
doctor-there are tools in your car

  she started through the open entrance
-but a hand flashed to her arm gripped
hard stopped her she stared into dr-
hunts ruddy loose-jowled face trying
to tear away from him the car was stand-
ing directly outside its headlamps beam-
ing-but his grasp on claires arm was
secure his gaze forbidding

  there are no tools in my car he de-
clared gruffly do you understand call
the state police ill keep trying hurry

  he thrust her toward the telephone she
took it up spoke automatically looking
horrified at her brother dr hunt was
again bent over bob endeavoring now
his fingers on a link of chain to bend its
joint apart it was too strong for him
claire realized that with growing despair
as she rushed her message over the wire
she was replacing the phone when jims
voice roared

  agda agdat where did you put my
tools

  the calm mellow voice of the house-
keeper answered from the kitchen i
havent touched them mr forester

tims steps sounded quickly metallic
 things clattered a mocking cacophony
as he hurled unwanted objects aside
emptied drawers thrust into cabinets
claire heard it all like a din in a weird
dream as she watched dr hunt striving
to remove the chain-in vain suddenly
jim appeared in the doorway eyes glinting
with desperate urgency

  theyre gone somebody took them
away somebody stole them

  dr hunt blurted in despair i cant
get it off

  claire saw a screwdriver in jims
clenched hand he snatched a bronze
paper weight off his drawing-board fell
to his knees at bobs side bobs convul-
sive attempts to breathe were ceasing
tremors passed through his body as dr
hunt pulled at the linked circle at a
ghastly crunching sound claire shrank
back covering her eyes-the noise made
by cartilage breaking in bobs tortured
throat then a quick frantic hammering
-the paperweight striking the head of
the screwdriver-a rhythmic pounding
that drove claires mind toward hugo
cliffe hugo cliffe had chisels-sharp-
edged chisels-instruments that could free
bob from the deadly collar far faster than
the blunt point of the screwdriver the
hope drove claire toward the door-a
hope stronger than her fear of the man
who owned the implements she was
hurrying past dr hunts car filled only
with the thought of saving her brother
from suffocation when she heard jims
voice ring

  its loose

  she turned back through the entrance
she watched wide-eyed jim pulling the
encarnadined links from the swollen folds
necklaces for the dying



of bobs neck jim threw the chain aside
stooping to press his ear to bobs still
chest stung by surging grief claire
studied jims blanched face his pinched
lips as he rose he looked at her with
silent compassion-but the eloquence of
his silence told her that bobs heart was
no longer beating

  dr hunt rolled claires brother face
down straddled over him spread hands
pressed to bobs ribs he leaned forward
then back with an even regular beat he
forced air in and out of the lungs that
death had stilled coldly fascinated still
wordless claire went into jims arms
a sound parted them-the whine of a
car speeding along the road

  it swerved sharply from the pavement
into the dirt drive when it bucked to a
stop near the entrance two blue-uni-
formed men ducked out they were state
troopers from the barracks in elmsford
only a few miles away-claires call had

brought them at top speed they hurried
into the house carrying a resuscitator
claire kept watching her cold hand in
jims the efforts of these men to restore
a life that had been horribly snuffed out

  the carried bob into the bedroom on
the ground floor claire did not follow-
she remained in the living-room listening
to the wheeze of the machine as it pumped
valves clicked and air hissed-it went
on and on mechanically unendtirably

phe beating sound continued a long
time each click of its valves under-
mining the girls hope that it would re-
store her brother to life her mind was
a kaleidoscope of terrifying images while
she listened bobs swollen face as he burst
in the door-the eyes of the cat-the
grimly set features of dr hunt as he
said there are no tools in my car
claire thought that strange no tools in
an automobile it seemed incredible-

 when a few seconds might have made the
 difference between bobs life and death

   she went out toward the car wonder-
 ing her haunting fear urging her to make
 sure of every possible reality the four
 men were working feverishly in the bed-
 room-she was certain she was not being
 watched carefully without making a
 sound she shifted the seat cushion of dr
 hunts coupe in the glow of the dash
 she saw the glitter of tools

   jims tools she recognized them at
 once his claw hammer with his initials
 branded in the handle his cold chisel
 his strong-jawed cutting pliers-she
 recognized a nick she had herself made
 in the steel edges she did not touch
 them she gazed at them in stunned won-
 derment remembering that dr hunt
 had said there are no tools in my car
 but there were tools in his car-jims
 own

   she replaced the cushion when she
 turned back to the entrance she knew what
 she was going to do she would say
 nothing of this to anyone until she had
 told jim she was sure of herself but
 she wanted jims clear-headed counsel

 as she stepped into the living-room she
 saw jim turning away from the bed on
 which bob lay

   the pulmotor was not operating now
 one of the state troopers was restoring
 it to its case dr hunt was spreading a
 blanket over bob and jims pallid face
 told claire that her brother was dead be-
 yond recall

   a uniformed man was standing at the
 table holding the red length of chain be-
 tween a thick thumb and a stubby fore-
 finger claire knew his name-lieutenant
 korbert he was squat bull-necked taci-
 turn his black eyes smouldered with
 hidden thoughts instinctively she mis-
 trusted him as she gazed at him in-
 specting the bloody links that had choked

bobs life away he became a part of the
dread that haunted her

  he lived alone in a cabin far back in
the hills-claire had seen it hidden in a
hollow almost a secret retreat in the
state police car he came and went over
a lonely back road no one else used and
when on duty he patrolled the main high-
way with a dogged regularity she had
come upon him in odd places standing
silent watching something-he seemed to
be everywhere so that whenever she wan-
dered into the hills she went with an ex-
pectant dread that she would come upon
him standing silent at some mysterious
self-appointed post

  she watched him intently as he lowered
the chain to the table and turned hia
smouldering gaze upon her

  thats the way the others went he
said in his peculiar chesty tone first
your father then your uncle choked to
death-like him-with a chain around the
neck

chapter three

the graven decree

che tried to piece it all together as she
sat in the living-room with jim a
closed door shrouding her brothers body
in silence an investigation would be held
lieut korbert had told her dr hunt
had gone with the two state troopers
claire and jim were alone silent and
stunned

  first your father then your uncle

  claire had been honeymooning with jim
in england when the news of the death
of barnett baird had reached her she
had not heard the strange details until
after her return-how he had been found
in the garden a swollen-faced corpse
strangled with a circle of chain only
one conclusion was possible-murder the
investigation had brought no suspect to
necklaces for the dying



light had not even revealed a motive
yet months later barnett bairds brother
gaylord had met the same doom

  gaylord had inherited the house upon
the death of gaires father and had come
here to live-a quiet scholarly gentleman
of the old school alive with a searching
curiosity gaire and jim living then in
a small apartment in the greenwich vil-
lage section of new york gty had fre-
quently paid him weekend visits they
had arrived one saturday to find lieut
korbert in charge and gaylord baird
dead-dead with a linked band around
his neck and again the investigation
of the police had yielded not the slightest
clue

  jim-i found your tools in dr hunts
car

  gaire said it abruptly jim jerked up
alarmed yet incredulous they were silent
a moment striving to grasp the full dread
meaning of those few words until gaire
repeated them

  i found your tools in dr hunts car
  you must be mistaken

  you said yourself somebody took them
away-somebody stole them i believe
that it was done so we would have no
means of getting the chain off bobs neck
the man who did that to him wanted to
be sure it would kill him i saw the tools
-under the cushion-in dr hunts car
you might easily be wrong about their
being mine gaire jim said slowly you
were upset naturally-and tools can look
a great deal alike they couldnt have
been mine-the ones you saw what rea-
son could dr hunt have for-

  but he said he had no tools he kept
me from going to the car when i men-
tioned it the cutters were there they
might have saved bobs life but he told
me-i remember it distinctly-there are
no tools in my car

  she was silent another moment under
jims searching gaze she stirred un-

easily as she felt a presence in the room
-an uncanny warning that someone or
some thing was gazing at her alarmed
she looked around in the shadow in the
corner she saw two yellow eyes the cat
was there watching her-listening

  she blurted dont talk now jim we
mustnt say anything while hes here hell
-tell-hugo giffe 

  gaire

  the consternation ringing in jims voice
startled her she saw a strange question-
ing light in his eyes his gaze turned to
the grey cat sitting in the shadow-almost
invisible save for its shining eyes-then
he rose he sat on the arm of her chair
slipping his arm reassuringly around her

  gaire darling youre over-wrought
youre saying things you dont mean in
the morning when youve had a chance
to rest well start from the beginning
and-

  someones coming

a car was grinding into the drive jims
arm tightened around claire before
he went to the door keep hold of your-
self sweet-this isnt like you at all
headlamp shafts swept across him as he
opened the entrance brakes squeaked
and two men trudged to the door one
was a serious-faced young man wearing
a dark topcoat over a white internes uni-
form the other was dr hunt

  sorry to disturb you-a damned awk-
ward thing the shaggy-headed physician
rumbled ive lost a tubule of radium i
was using it on mrs chedwick-cancer
patient you know-and taking it back to
the hospital tonight found out when i
arrived i didnt have it its valuable and
needed at the hospital do you mind if
i look for it here 

  gaire asked uneasily what makes
you believe you lost it here doctor
hunt came in followed by the interne


dime mystery magazine

the young man was carrying a sealed
glass flask containing two fluttering bright
leaves supported by a wire hook attached
to a cork he held it tenderly as dr
hunt explained

  it must have dropped out of this little
lead box-the catch is loose he opened
his case and removed a flat container not
more than two inches across of dull grey-
ish lustre raising its hinged lid to dis-
closed a pad of cotton marked by an empty
depression he added it might have
lodged in the coils of my stethoscope and
dropped to the floor its very small but
worth thousands of dollars if you dont
mind-

  jim answered quietly not at all

  claire forester watched with fascinated
bewilderment this friendly old man in
whose car she had found jims missing
tools he had paid them many neighborly
calls-his presence at the time bob was
choking to death could easily be explained
in that way-yet claire could not forget
the tools while she watched she won-
dered if dr hunts explanation was a
blind to cover some secret purpose that
had driven him to return

  the interne drew a shining rod from
his pocket and briskly polished it he
brought the rod near a brass ball affixed to
the cork of the flask the two drooping
aluminum leaves suspended on the hook
inside immediately flew apart he held
the flask close to the floor and began to
move it about watching it anxiously

  dr hunt rumbled like charges re-
pel its an electroscope if it is brought
near radium when charged the radium
emanations cause the leaves to collapse
in that way we can locate the tubule if
it isnt here ill have to take it along every
inch of the way to the hospital weve
already gone all over my car with it-it
isnt there

  but- claire almost said it aloud-
the tools are    jims stolen tools  

  the interne made a circuit of the room
while the leaves of the electroscope re-
mained spread like the wings of a sliver
bird in flight thousands of dollars dr
hunt mumbled ill have to make it good
if i dont find it- a hush filled the room
as the search continued with claires alert
gaze never leaving the ruddy face of the
doctor in the corner near the old desk
her father had used the interne straight-
ened

  not anywhere in here he said
looks like-hello its discharging
slowly the silver leaves drooped until
they hung limp dr hunt strode into
the corner jubilantly taking the electro-
scope into his hands he urged charge
it again while the interne briskly rubbed
the rod generating static electricity jim
frowned curiously in the desk he
asked that couldnt be it hasnt been
open tonight

  at the touch of the rod to the brass
ball the silver leaves again flew apart
rolled under it perhaps dr hunt said
as he stooped-but while he moved the
flask about near the floor the strips of
aluminum foil registered no discharge
looking puzzled the doctor rose then
again the leaves began to droop he
moved the instrument closer to the glass
door of the old secretary and abruptly a
complete discharge registered

  you didnt find the tubule he asked
quickly and put it in the desk

  not i jim forester answered did
you claire

  no

  dr hunt mumbled strange some-
thing inside there perhaps in that little
chest caused the electroscope to discharge
this is very important to me you know-
the amount of money involved do you
mind making absolutely sure

  claire observed that old chest was
my fathers doctor its locked and we
havent found the key
necklaces for the dying



  then i dont understand the physi-
cian exclaimed i dont

jim opened the glass door removed the
little chest it was heavy and as he
moved it something rattled inside age
had seasoned its wood blackened the cop-
per strips which bound it claire knew
its lid was firmly fastened but jim tried
it to make sure then once more the
interne charged the electroscope-and
once more immediately it was brought
near the chest the leaves quickly and com-
pletely collapsed

  jim said decisively ill break it open
he pried a letter-opener into the crack
the old wood groaned suddenly the
metal catch snapped claire came close
as jim raised the lid the chest con-
tained leather-bound books closely packed
in which gave off a rich musty smell-
diaries according to the golden word
stamped on their covers-but at one side
lay two velvet-black objects irregular as
stones gleaming with a pitch-like lustre

  dr hunt curiously took up one of the
fragments the interne observed what-
ever it is its radioactive they made a
test while claire and jim watched putting
the charged electroscope on the table then
bringing the black stone near it again
the discharge of the leaves was prompt
and complete dr hunt frowning asked
curious-may i take this with me 
certainly

  thanks-thanks but this isnt find-
ing my tubule of radium im sorry its
necessary but do you mind if- his blue-
veined hand gestured toward the door be-
hind which bob baird lay dead

  jims nod gave permission as hunt
and the interne stepped into the hushed
room claire again became conscious of a
steady scrutiny she turned her heart
speeding searching for the yellow eyes-
and she saw them gleaming in the dark

comer the cat was there his implacable
gaze radiant with a subtle evil wisdom-
silent watching listening

  he moved a gliding black shadow
toward the entrance at the door he
mewed claires breath caught as a reali-
zation chilled her jim she said in a
whisper cats do talk-we both know
that do you understand what marco
is saying now he wants to go out hes
saying please open the door do you hear
him jim

  jims hand took claires darling-
im not going to let him out hes
been listening-listening to everything
weve said hell go straight to hugo
cliffe-and theyll talk together-and
hugo cliffe will know everything thats
happened here im not going to let him


go

  while she spoke she gazed intently at
the grey cat and the cat emitted a plead-
ing mew that said please open the door
-open the door

  she turned on jim suddenly how else
can you explain it  i said it while we were
alone upstairs-i felt it the moment i
stepped through the door no one could
possibly have heard it outside our room
we were alone just you and i jim-and
marco tonight hugo cliffe repeated my
very words-i felt it the moment i
stepped through the door

  thats impossible claire

  but listen to marco now jim hes
talking cant you understand him  i can
-clearly and hugo cliffe can under-
stand him completely-because he isnt
a man    not a man but a human cat
-more of a cat than a human being
jim was staring at her with a startled
bewildered light in his eyes she had never
seen before he doubted her-she realized
it with a hopeless pang no one would
believe her about hugo cliffe she stood
mute with despair during a moment of
hush she heard soft footfalls in the room


dime mystery magazine

were bob lay dead she turned when the
door quietly opened

  dr hunt came out holding a small
metal tube in his fingers fortunate
he said very fortunate placing the
tiny object in the leaden case he added
it was lying in the fringe of a rug might
never have found it without the electro-
scope he closed his case with a click
of finality thanks very much for being
so considerate good night

  jim murmured not at all

  dr hunt opened the entrance quickly
claire was looking at the cat marco
she called suddenly sharply the cat
writhed out-a swift flowing grey move-
ment marco claire thrust the door
wide while hunt and the interne stared
her heart quickened coldly as she stood
outside unable to see the cat in the dark-
ness but sensing its movements through
a faint furtive rustle it was slinking
somewhere in the gloom gliding even
then toward the shop of hugo cliffe

  dread held her motionless as dr hunt
went to the waiting car good night mrs
forester

  when the starter snarled and the coupe
began jouncing along the drive she
turned back and went indoors jim was
looking curiously into the old chest packed
with diaries he took her arms forced a
reassuring smile

  chin up claire

  she said in a tight whisper marco is
going back-taking a message-to hugo
cliffe

jims head wagged look here youre
not yourself darling wont you try
to rest ill stay down here in case the
police come back tonight and-

   i cant rest im going to follow marco
ive got to make sure somehow if i dont
ill go mad come with me jim

  he protested gravely we cant leave
bob alone

  im going she insisted even if i
have to go alone jim cant you under-
stand please come with me

  his hands tightened on her shoulders
listen to me claire you cant let this
get you tonight youre so upset you dont
know what youre thinking or doing to-
morrow it will all seem different-easier
youre going to bed

  his tone was sternly paternal he was
scolding her like a frightened child he
didnt - couldnt - wouldnt understand
hopelessness flooded into her mind again
but her determination to learn the truth
did not waver she answered guilefully

  all right jim ill try to get some
sleep

  she went wearily into the hall as she
climbed the stairs she heard jim moving
agitatedly about the living-room she
waited at the top of the flight until he
quieted she went down step by step
making no sound through the doorway
she saw jim slouched in a chair staring
into space he did not notice her she
slowly followed the wall into the dark
kitchen silently she sidled out the back
entrance

  far across the stone wall the lights of
hugo cliffes workshop were gleaming
she stood listening for a faint rustle that
might betray the presence of the cat lurk-
ing in the dark she heard a different
sound-a rhythmic clinking that chilled
her it was metal striking metal with
slow even blows somewhere in the open
night it was not the wind carrying the
beat from hugo cliffes shop it was
coming from somewhere near the road

  the sound made claires blood icy be-
cause it turned her tormented mind to bob
-bob dying in horrible pain a chain
choking the life from him somehow he
had been held helpless while someone
clamped the steel collar around his neck
someone had banded it deep into his
throat hooking an open link then pound-
necklaces for the dying



ing the joint firmly together claire had
heard a faint tap-tapping echoing in the
night at the very moment the chained
doom was trapping bob and now she
was hearing it again issuing from the
depths of the darkness

  clink-clink clink-clink

  a magnetic horror led her past the
front of the house seeking the source of
the sound while it continued to echo
through the gloom when she neared the
road a light appeared gleaming behind
thick bushes flanking the pavement clink-
clink-clink-clink-it was coming out of
the glow apprehensively claire groped to
the wall and pulled herself over she
ventured across a grassy field toward the
light and the ringing rhythm

  she crouched behind another wall that
paralleled the road peering through the
bushes a car had stopped at the edge of
the pavement the light was beaming
from its headlamps at its side a husky
dark figure was kneeling shoulders
hunched the shadow man was intently
at work weilding a hammer he paused
at his task and straightened claire saw
his face and what he was doing

  it was lieut korbert he was chang-
ing the rear tire of his police car he was
holding a wrench in one hand hammering
it to release a frozen bolt unaware of
claires scrutiny he went on working a
rasping nerve-chilling screech sounded as
the bolt twisted in its rusty socket claire
suppressed a broken laugh of relief-yet
she could not shake her dread of the man
working there in the gloom

  she crept away from the wall follow-
ing a narrow foot-path across the field she
gazed searchingly at the bright light shin-
ing from the workshop of hugo cliffe

fphe girl approached slowly the door
of the shed hung crookedly on a broken
hinge and through the crack a fan of
light spread she dared step into it so

that she could look into the shop she
saw cliffe squatting on his bench in
front of a tombstone with polished face
his chisel ringing under the regular blows
of his hammer was etching characters on
the shiny surface and at his feet was
the cat

  the grey cat was writhing back and
forth against hugo cliffes ankles purr-
ing voluptuously mewing plaintively ob-
sessed with a drunken hunger that ex-
pressed itself in flowing silken move-
ments cliffe grinned evilly as the cats
lithe body rubbed him he looked down
spoke in a feline tone placed his tools
aside he brought the cat into his dusty
strong hands-and the girl heard them
talk

  the cats high-pitched voice quavered
the man answered with crooning throaty
words the girl listened to an unholy
communion between them you are a
friend-a true friend cliffe purred
now i know-where it is hidden-be-
cause you came to tell me go back now
-watch and listen-let them have no
secrets no secrets   

  cliffe carried the cat gently to the par-
tially opened door placed it on the white
chip-packed floor and turned back to his
work the weaving of the cats tail his
pleading mewing said that he did not
wish to go reluctantly he turned glid-
ing off into the gloom from the bright
interior of the shop the clinking of metal
on metal of metal on stone came again
claire forester was turning away with a
shudder when she glimpsed the characters
etched into the shining surface

  they brought her closer with a hypnotic
lure she almost ceased to breathe as she
yielded to a spell of terror that drew her
closer step by step there were two tomb-
stones standing near hugo cliffes bench
-he had been at work on both of them
the inscriptions were incomplete yet the
words were starkly legible-words that

put a paralyzing frigidity iato the girls
heart

  on the monument standing nearest the
door she saw the aame of her husband

 james gregory forester
     born january  
     died

  and on the other-the stone oh which
hugo cliffes chisel was working while
she watched-her own name

  claire baird forester
       born june  
       died

  markers for graves-prepared for the
day of death-with nly the date of a
promised doom waiting to be enscribed by
the tools of hugo cliffe

a choking cry of terror broke from
claire foresters numb lips her hand
pressed to her mouth to stifle it-but
hugo cliffe looked up his feline eyes
gleaming yellow around their elongated
pupils fastened upon her with their hor-
rible paralyzing power his tools dropped
with a clatter he started toward the
door hands raising to seize the girl she
tore herself desperately away from the
hypnotic stare threatening to engulf her-
wrenched away into the darkness-and
ran

  flying along the road frozen by the
dread that hugo cliffe was stalking her
on swift feline feet she was unaware of
the police car until she was almost upon it
sight of lieut korbert struck her a new
fearful blow he was standing in the
glow of the headlamps motionless silent
his smouldering gaze squarely upon her
she felt as she fled past him that her
feet were dragging through loose sand
when she flung herself against the en-
trance of her home she was weak with
overwhelming fear

  jim jerked up from his chair she
threw herself into his arms she clung
to him as the only salvation she knew
in a world of inescapable horrors

  through her sobs she heard his star-
tled questions where have you been 
how did you get out  whats happened 
but she could not answer she steadied
herself with an effort her hands closed
tightly on his arms steadfastly meeting
his intent gaze

  youve got to come with me
  where claire

  back to hugo cliffes shop youve
got to come youve got to see it with
your own eyes youll believe me then
what did you see 

  tombstones-two of them one with
your name on it jim the other for me
ready to be put on our graves-every-
thing there-except the date of death
her voice rose frantically its true jim
i saw them

  jim said tightly keep hold of your-
self claire

  he snatched up his hat jerked open
the front door his hand closed firmly on
claires arm as they went out while
they followed the dirt driveway a motor
sang along the road claire saw the car
when they reached the pavement its tail-
light a vanishing red beacon she knew it
was lieut korbert-but she was thinking
now only of the two gravestones she had
seen-ponderous promises of a waiting
death she kept close at jims side as
they rapidly approached the shop of hugo
cliffe

  she paused to whisper do you hear
it jim

  the rhythmic tap-tapping of metal on
stone-it was beating out of the stone-
workers shed beyond the broken door
in the bright glare he was busily at work
claire saw him through the crack as she
clung to jims arm-hunching at his bench
tapping his chisel with his hammer while
necklaces for the dying



stone-dust sifted through the air there
were the two headstones as she had seen
them but now   

  jim stopped as he pulled the loose door
wide hugo cliffe looked up with a smile
and said affably why good evening
qaire went in with jim slowly be-
wildered appalled she gazed at the two
tombstones one of them the nearest on
which she had seen her own name en-
graved was-blank and the other-it
bore a nme that struck grief into her
heart but it was not the name she had
seen

  robert barnett baird
     born may  
     died october  

  hugo cliffe said gravely i hope you
will accept it as a token of esteem from
an old neighbor i made the headstones
for your father and your uncle mrs
forester will he be buried in the ceme-
tery beside them i thought he would-
it is a large plot-large enough for all
the family

  claire shuddered as she asked where
are the others what did you do with
the other two stones

  cliffe echoed gently the others
jim was looking at her searchingly
she turned to him tensely her gaze im-
ploring him to believe her these arent
the two stones i saw he changed them
hes terribly strong-he could do it with-
out help he put the first two away then
put these others in their place look for
them jim-please look for them

  her husband asked cliffe stiffly you
didnt waste any time going about it did
you-carving a stone for bob 

  i started it as soon as i heard cliffe
answered i always do its the same as
the stones i made for his father and his
uncle

  how did you hear

  doctor hunt dropped in

  who is the other stone for

  mrs chedwick-doctor hunts can-
cer patient she died tonight

  claire stepped trembling toward the
cat-eyed stone-worker you did change
them two tombstones-one with jims
name the other with mine-they were
standing where these are now what did
you do with them where did you put
them 

  cliffe said i dont know what you
mean mrs forester

  she turned again imperatively to jim
he wont tell the truth they must be
somewhere in this shop those-against
the wall turned face in-do you under-
stand jim  please look-please find them
-or ill go mad

jim walked toward the row of stones
sitting against the dusty shop wall the
faces turned toward him were shiny un-
marked their rear surfaces were placed
within an inch of the dusty boards jim
gripped the upper edge of one of them
tried to pull it away the weight of the
massive block was too much for him-his
muscles were supple and tempered by daily
sessions of tennis but he could not move
the block he went from one to another
trying each but in every case his attempt
to see the rear surface of the slab was
baffled by its ponderous mass

  claire was gazing accusingly at hugo
qiffe why dont you help him she
asked huskily youre strong you can
move them alone ive seen you do it in
the quarry why dont you move them
hugo cliffe

  qiffe did not stir he repeated i dont
know what you mean mrs forester

  jim forester turned away from the row
of stones he frowned at the marker
bearing bob bairds name then looked
at claire-and she saw doubt lingering in
his eyes he said quietly wed better
go back qaire she shook her head in

protest but he went to the door as he
was pushing it open he stooped and
picked a bit of cardboard from the stony
floor-a small carton crushed he smiled
wryly slipped it into his pocket and said
firmly

  come on darling

  utter bewilderment filled claire she
went to jim not because she had aban-
doned her certainty of what she had seen
but because the evilly powerful eyes of
hugo cliffe were hungrily upon her she
slipped her arm anxiously through jims
as they walked toward the road moving
slowly through the darkness they heard
again the ringing tap-tap of hugo cliffes
chisel trimming bobs name in the grave-
stone

  they did not speak until they were in
the house as they stood gazing at each
other silently the uncanny sensation of
being watched returned to claire look-
ing around apprehensively she saw the
yellow eyes-the eyes of the grey cat
watching her from the shadow in the
corner she turned quickly picked him up
she opened the door tossed him into the
darkness he landed silently on his
padded paws turned his amber gaze upon
her mewed a protest

  go back she told the cat go back
and tell him im sure of what i saw tell
him im going to make everyone believe
it-everyone-because its true

  the ring of her voice sent the cat
slinking off into the gloom closing the
door turning she saw the old chest sit-
ting on the leaf of the secretary she re-
membered hugo cliffe talking with the
cat and felt suddenly that the chest was
important now i know-where it is
hidden-because you came to tell me she
went quickly to jim searching his tired
eyes

  weve got to go away jim weve
got to leave this house and never come
back

  we cant go claire-you know that
anywhere-but we cant stay jim
we cant the horrible things that have
happened-theyll come again i know
theyll come again because i saw our
names on the tombstones hugo cliffe was
cutting it drives me out of my mind
when i think of it jim-finding you as
we found bob tonight-with a headstone
waiting all ready except the date of-
claire jim spoke in a low tone
firmly youve been right from the begin-
ning theres something terrible at work
-something that killed your father and
your brother and your uncle-something
hovering over this house but we cant
go-not only because we havent any
money-but because we cant admit were
licked weve got to fight it claire-stay
and fight it

  yes she whispered fight it   
she turned to the desk and took up the
seasoned chest laden with old diaries
she carried it under her arm as she went
up the stairs the sound of a closing
door came down the flight-then there was
silence claire foresters husband sat
alone in the library silent and motionless
keeping a vigil over the dead

chapter four

doom knocks

tright sun streamed through crystal-
clear air when claire forester turned
her car off the highway late in the after-
noon of the next day she left it in the
driveway and went into the house carry-
ing a heavy package in the store-room
near the kitchen she unwrapped the bun-
dle she left her purchases on the table
in the corner-a pair of strong-jawed
cutters two smaller pairs of pliers a ham-
mer and a keen-edged cold chisel

  before she turned away she made sure
of the position of each tool so that she
necklaces for the dying



might if necessary find them at once in
the dark she stepped into the kitchen
agda the housekeeper was making prep-
arations for the evening meal she was a
plump woman her grey hair drawn tightly
back in a knot her eyes a mild blue claire
asked her quietly

  where is mr forester agda
sleeping mrs forester he asked to
be wakened for dinner

  claire looked at agda cliffe intently
this woman was the sister of the stone-
worker she shared hugo cliffes trait
of tireless industry she was busy in the
kitchen at dawn her activity never ceased
until late at night she never stepped out-
side except to do her chores-never dur-
ing all the weeks since claire and jim had
come to live in the house had she crossed
the stone wall to visit her brother and
never had she so much as called hugo
cliffe on the telephone her world was
bounded by her endless toil-yet claire
told herself with sharp misgivings she
was the sister of hugo cliffe and she al-
ways fed the grey cat

  the cat was in the kitchen now wan-
dering after agda from sink to cabinet to
refrigerator contentedly purring
agda claire said incisively

  yes mrs forester

  there are some new tools lying on the
table in the store-room you are not
to touch them no one is to touch them
except mr forester or myself ever do
you understand that quite clearly
agda cliffe turned her steady blue eyes
on claire ive never touched mr for-
esters tools-never ill leave them strictly
alone

  claire felt somehow as she turned
away that the woman was telling the
truth that she would keep her word she
went out of the house intending to put
the car in the garage which sat at the
rear but as she opened its door she
paused the sound inevitably put a chill

in her blood-that regular ringing metal-
lic tapping she heard it carrying on the
wind from the craggy hills

  the clear sunlight had helped claire
fight down her fear though she could not
free herself of it entirely the tap-tapping
she heard now began to bring it back-it
was a challenge to her composure a threat
against her sanity because she was de-
termined to defeat that consuming dread
she left the car and walked toward the
source of the sound it led her along a
path into the rugged hills

  the quarry lay below her-as she paused
on the crest of a hill it was a ragged
cubical cavity in the valley simon cliffe
had opened it and hugo cliffe carrying
on his fathers craft had deepened it its
walls were sheer and mottled dipping deep
into a mirror-surfaced pool the rains
of the years had collected in its depths
from it had come the stones which now
marked the graves of the villages dead

  hugo cliffe was working on a ledge far
above the still surface of the pool he was
wielding a sledge driving wedges into
holes he had bored in the deposit while
claire watched knowing he was unaware
of her presence he labored without a
seconds pause-strenuous back-straining
effort that would soon have exhausted an-
other man the power of his supple mus-
cles suddenly split a line between the row
of holes with an explosive crack and a
slab of stone leaned out

  a warm soft touch at her ankle star-
tled claire her eyes jerked down at
her feet the grey cat was moving-rub-
bing himself against her purring hungrily
claire recoiled at the contact-but she
tried to fight the fear put into her heart
by the animal after all she told her-
self this is a pet ive kept for years and
loved she stooped to pick him up-but
suddenly with a frightened mew the cat
darted away

  he was a grey movement trickling


dime mystery magazine

down the crags of the quarry he vanished
with a sleek rapidity-in the direction of
hugo cliffe

  the girls eyes returned lo the man he
was tearing the block of stone from its
socket with superhuman strength he
whipped a rope around it pressed one
hard knot upon another when he began
climbing up claire marked the amazing
feline litheness of his movements at
ground level he began to draw the rope
through a pulley hoisting the heavy slab
higher and higher never for an instant
ceasing his effort

  while claire watched fascinated hugo
cliffe dragged the stone toward a light
truck stationed near the brink of the
quarry he turned it end over end then
with incredible dexterity and power tilted
it into the truck-bed the stone fell flat
with a resounding crash that testified to
its immense weight cliffe was turning
toward the wheel evincing not the slight-
est sign of fatigue when a black move-
ment streaked across the ground toward
him

  the cat  it rubbed itself sensually
against cliffes ankles he brought it
into his dusty hands and they gazed at
each other-the cat and the man claire
could hear the animals mewing the mans
crooning purr then-as though the feline
had told cliffe exactly where she was
standing-the stone-worker turned his
powerful eyes upon claire

a chill struck through her but she
stood her ground as cliffe came
toward her she did not retreat because
it would have been an admission that she
was afraid he paused stood silent a
moment the lodestone of his eyes acting
evilly upon her he said in a low smooth
tone

  he stands between us-your husband
nothing in the world can combat the
power that binds us together-not even

his life its only a trifle a small obstacle
to be swept aside you feel it-you cant
resist it-this force that makes us one
through all eternity

  the girl stood transfixed so fascinated
by the spell of the stone-workers eyes
that his voice seemed a far-away chant

  it will come to him because it must-
death it will come at it came to the
others-the chain around his throat you
must tell no one that it is nearing him
hour by hour it comes closer because our
love decrees it-an influence stronger
than the force whirling the planets through
their orbits we are waiting for it to-
gether-his death-you and i   

  claire blurted youre mad-mad

  she forced herself to turn away but
she did not hasten she walked deliber-
ately along the path feeling the pull of
hugo cliffes horrible cats eyes with-
out allowing herself even to look back
she approached the house-but the fear
had returned to her the dread had
clamped again upon her heart her terror
became a sharp stinging chill when she
came to an abrupt pause peering at a
figure standing silent in the long shadows
cast by the sinking sun

  lieut korbert he was stationed
among the trees on the far side of the
stone wall motionless as a graven image
his smouldering black gaze upon her still
she would not allow herself to betray her
apprehension she nodded to him with
simulated casualness and went on

  she tried to seem calm and self-pos-
sessed while the fear gnawed deeper into
her soul jim was shaving getting ready
for dinner-she talked with him lightly
when they went down she stole a moment
to look into the store-room the new
tools were still in their places untouched
agda served dinner with her usual effi-
ciency-and marco polo sat as always
at claires side his amber eyes expect-
antly upon her
necklaces for the dying



  but the cats gaze increased her dread
she could not keep her thoughts from
her lips in spite of his presence she told
jim of her walk to the quarry of seeing
the cat and hugo cliffe talking together
-how he had looked up to impale her un-
erringly with his gaze marco told him
where i was he looked straight at me
at once

  a movement you werent aware of
claire-a sound you didnt hear

  but there is something between them
something we cant grasp marco is
drawn to him in some strange way-
jim laughed softly from his pocket
he removed the crushed cardboard carton
he had picked off the floor of cliffes
workshop the night previous he tossed
it across the table to claire with a
chuckle theres the strange power
hugo cliffe has over marco cat-nip-
thats all

  claire echoed his laugh but it was
forced she grew silent for a while then
her thoughts forced her to speak

  hugo and my father were boys to-
gether-friends it was a queer sort of
companionship-it lasted until fathers
death yet i always felt there was some-
thing lurking in the background i asked
questions when i was in the village to-
day about hugo cliffe his father com-
mitted suicide under dishonorable cir-
cumstances but i didnt learn anything
definite behind it all jim i know theres
some sort of secret

jim did not speak but in the silence
claire heard a memory of hugo cliffes
voice that made her shrink we are
waiting for it together-your husbands
death-you and i  a promise of
impending doom hour by hour it comes
closer   claire remained quiet striv-
ing to retain her poise until she had
drained her coffee cup then quickly she
rose

  she went at once to the telephone
recollection that this was a party line
made her pause six instruments she
knew were connected with the same wire
-among them hugo cliffes dr hunts
lieut korberts with a determined set
of her lips she made her call the rumble
that answered was dr hunts voice

  mrs forester calling doctor there
is something jim and i must talk over
with you immediately please come right
over

  yes of course the physician ans-
wered ill walk it if you dont mind-
need the exercise by the way-speaking
of the queer black rock we found in your
fathers old chest-do you mind if i have
it analyzed very curious i have it
wrapped now ready to mail to the city
claire answered its not necessary
doctor i know what it is    well wait
for you

  jim was at her side when she pronged
the receiver he asked what are you
doing whats on your mind  her chin
lifted with renewed determination as she
went toward the secretary she answered
i cant endure this any longer jim im
going to get to the bottom of it im go-
ing to ask doctor hunt about the tools
jim frowned do you mean youre
going to accuse him of stealing them
dont you realize thats tantamount to ac-
cusing him of murder

  claire removed the old chest from the
shelf-but she paused because the grey
cat was looking at her seated near a
chair his amber eyes fixed upon her in
penetrating scrutiny he was listening
claire fought an impulse to drive him
from the room she turned squarely to
jim the chest in her hands

  there are so many other things be-
sides the tools jim there must be a
reason why father and uncle gaylord
and bob all were killed the same way-
choked to death by a chain the same


dime mystery magazine

man must have committed the three mur-
ders in each case for the same motive i
think i know whats behind it all-but
that isnt as important as something else
the same thing may happen to you jim
-and me

  jim began you know-

  hugo cliffe believes its going to hap-
pen to us-because he has the tombstones
ready i did see them jim perhaps he
doesnt know who the murderer is but he
expects it to come it is coming-hour
by hour its coming closer claire shud-
dered as she heard herself echo the words
of hugo cliffe theres only one way
we can save ourselves weve got to learn
the secret before that ghastly choking
death claims us jim

  he asked her tautly claire what have
you learned

  she placed the chest on the table re-
moved one of the diaries opened it to a
scribbled page

  she was silent while jim read the
eyes of the cat were still upon her to
free her mind of the chill brought by the
unflinching yellow gaze she followed the
words over jims shoulder the first
entry she whispered was written sev-
eral weeks before fathers death

  it was

     while walking in the hills this afternoon
   we found a curious mineral near the edge
   of the quarry though i can identify most
   of the rocks characteristic of this location
   it was strange to me-a deep black sub-
   stance that shines like pitch i have sent a
   sample of it to the city for chemical analy-
   sis on the chance that it might be valuable
   but more particularly to satisfy my curiosity

  he wrote we claire pointed out
quietly but he forgot to mention the
name of the person who was with him
the next-

    extraordinary good fortune the chem-
  ists report on the black substance i found

   near the quarry is that it is pitchblende it
   is the most precious ore in the world be-
   cause it yields radium most pitchblende

  i find is mined in africa but it is also found
  in the united states-in texas north caro-
  lina colorado and in other parts of con-
  necticut the ore may be worked at a profit
  even when it yields no more than one gram
  of radium to ten tons of ore this is be-
  cause the value of radium is fabulous-about
   per ounce while gold by com-
  parison is worth only  per ounce at the
  present market price there are only about
   grams of radium in the united states
  at this writing and in all the world not more
  than a pound and a quarter has been pro-
  duced so far

    this afternoon dr hunt dropped in for
  tea and we had a long friendly chat he
  left only a few moments ago now for a
  brisk walk before dinner

tim turned the page and stared startled
 at unfilled lines he blurted in amaze-
ment  its the last entry he ever made
he flipped back to the date and jerked
out of his chair he wrote it the day
he died

  claire forgot the stare of the cat she
leaned forward tensely her hands closed
into small fists dont you see jim
someone else knew from the very be-
ginning someone killed father to keep
the secret he wanted it for himself-
that precious stuff he wanted it so much
he didnt stop at murder

  jim reached into the chest brought in-
to his hand a fragment of the pitchy min-
eral the black sheen of its surface
seemed to be yielding a hidden truth as
claire rushed on

  first father because hed found the
deposit then uncle gaylord because he
must have learned of it through fathers
diary then bob-because bob walked
back to the quarry that night and he
must have discovered someone digging-
stealing the ore now jim-you and i
-because we know we know and the
knowledge means death-with our tomb-
stones waiting for us now
necklaces for the dying



  yes jim was gazing intently at the
last words written by claires father be-
fore the choking death had claimed him
 dr hunt   a long friendly chat
you found the tools in hunts car he
came in all of a sudden while bob was
fighting for life he came back later
hunting for radium he said hed lost-
but if hes the man why didnt he-
jim listen

  claire had heard it-the faint echoing
tap-tapping of metal against metal it
throbbed through the night with the in-
exorable rhythm of knocking doom it
trickled an icy chill down her back as she
hurried to the entrance and flung it wide
it became louder-click-click click-click
-but it was not coming from the work-
shop of hugo cliffe it was not the grat-
ing of a chisel against stone it was a
clear metallic ticking that echoed every-
where in the night

  suddenly it stopped

  claire blurted i heard it-just like
that-before bob rushed in choking-
she turned quickly leaving the door
open driven by a fearful suspicion she
hurried along the hall thrust into the
store-room in the dark she groped to
the table in the corner and passed her
hands across the empty surface she
turned the key of the hanging light and
looked transfixed into the glare the new
tools were not where she had left them
the tools were gone

  she hurried out of the store-room in-
to the kitchen agda cliffe was at the
sink washing the dinner dishes her hands
busy and quick claire said abruptly
agda i told you not to touch mr for-
esters new tools the woman looked
up her blue eyes inscrutable she made
no answer until claire said even more
sharply

  you were not to touch the tools
then i havent even seen them mrs
forester

  dismayed baffled claire hurried back
to the living-room and jim jim was
turning the pages of a diary she stood
tensely silent listening-and again she
became conscious of the stare of the cat
he was sitting in the shadow watching
her the door was still standing open
but he had remained-gathering secrets
that he might carry to hugo cliffe jims
eyes jerked up when claire blurted
the new tools are missing
new-

  i bought some today-because i was
afraid we might need them as we needed
them for bob i put them in the store-
room now theyre gone somebodys
stolen them tim do you realize what
that means its coming-again-now
even as she spoke a strangling gasp-
ing cry carried in from the night it
turned her frozen toward the door it
brought jim alertly to her side it came
again-that ghastly choking gagging
sound-and then they saw the man he
was running wildly along the drive to-
ward the house staring insanely clawing
at his throat    dr hunt

  he stumbled in as jim hurried toward
him his eyes were protruding in a hor-
rible glare his swollen tongue parting
his puffed lips he sagged against the
wall as he tore at his neck his fingers
bloody the skin of his throat ripped by
his desperate efforts he slipped to the
floor as jim fought his hands down and
in the blood-gorged folds of his flesh
claire saw the glitter of the chain

  the doctors voice was a frantic sla-
vering mumble take it off god take it
off

  one tense moment jim bent over the
torture-wracked man striving to find a
means of loosening the deadly links he
jerked up ran to the rear of the house
seeking tools which claire knew he would
not find as she turned to assist him in
the hopeless search tearing her eyes from

the blood-swollen face of the doctor
quick footfalls froze her

   they were sounding in the driveway
swiftly they approached the man who
sped into the light was wearing the blue
uniform of a state trooper he paused
beside the dying man his smouldering
gaze directed straight at claire-lieut

prey of the quarry

rphe girl stood transfixed as korbert
a turned kneeling over hunt she
caught the gleam of an implement he
snatched from his coat pocket his thick
body covered the movements of his hands
as she listened to the ghastly strangling
sounds made by the dying man a burn-
ing wonder was flaring in her mind

  how did he know where did he come
from what is he doing

   korbert rose straddled he lifted dr
hunts limp body in his stocky arms
trudging heavily he went to the door
of the room where bobs body had lain
and kicked through claire saw him plac-
ing the physician on the bed immediately
he strode back closing the way his eyes
like smoking coals turned upon her as
he took up the telephone

   he was completing a call to the state
police barracks in elmsford when jim
returned breathless to the library kor-
bert went back to the door which shielded
dr hunt as he stepped through jim
glimpsed the physicians lax body
sprawled on the bed he started in but
korbert blocked the way thrust him back
stay out there im handling this
the door snapped shut jim turned
away stricken with dismay and bewilder-
ment claires gaze turned from his
drawn face into the shadow in the corner
there in the gloom yellow eyes were shin-
ing while she watched the grey sleek

body of the cat weaved toward the en-
trance he passed silently into the night
as claire whispered

  hes going to hugo cliffe hes go-
ing to tell hugo cliffe everything hes
heard

  jim said tightly ill see for myself
claire hurried out the door with him
bright light was streaming through the
broken door of the shed no clink-clink
of metal was issuing from it now-the
stone-workers chisel was idle the gleam
drew the grey cat he was a dark flow-
ing movement almost invisible as claire
and jim followed he glided into the
light through the crack of the door the
girl and her husband heard him speak in-
side-a plaintive mew

  the workshop was empty hugo
cliffes tools lay on his dusty bench be-
side the stone bearing the name of robert
baird the cat hopped upon it crying
again claire shivered with an under-
standing of his wail where are you
i am here i have news for you where
are you-where

  jim took slow steps toward the cat it
retreated bristling with fear as his hands
reached it leaped-but jims movement
was swifter he caught it in midair and
held it grimly in spite of its squirming
clawing efforts to escape he sat on the
bench forcing it against his legs and
pushed his fingers through its shaggy
silken hair

  he said suddenly heres something
it was white small as a medicinal cap-
sule as jims fingers combed it out of
the cats fur a faint snapping sound re-
sulted a black silk thread was tied to
the rolled bit of paper and had circled
the cats neck-jim had broken it he al-
lowed the cat to bound away as he peeled
the little white roll into a crinkled square
of paper eyes widened claire leaned
over his shoulder to read
necklaces for the dying



     they know all about the ore tonight is
  your last chance

  jim snapped agda wrote that shes
used the cat to carry messages to hugo
cliffe shes eavesdropped on us contin-
ually but he must have known anyway
-by listening in on the telephone hes at
the quarry now-im sure of it

  claire seized his arm as he hurried
from the shop her protesting pull did
not slow him she was forced to run to
keep up with his long firm strides along
the rutted road that led back into the
hills she realized now that danger must
not stop them-they must have the proof
of their own eyes as they hurried to-
ward the quarry they heard no sound but
their own quick footfalls saw no light
the glow of the moon made the quarry
a deep silver-bottomed hole when they
paused at its brink

  then a rhythmic sound it was not the
sharp click-click of metal but heavier and
muffled as though a pick were driving
into the earth it drew claire and jim
along the edge of the quarry they
paused peering down at a glow brighter
than the shine of the moon it was spread-
ing across rough rock from a cavity in
the sheer wall they saw it clearly-a
slab swung back disclosing a hollow from
which the light issued from it came the
even beating of tireless blows

  jim called down come out cliffe 
the dull pounding ceased a figure
appeared in the shine amber eyes with
elongated pupils looked up almost at
once hugo cliffe seemed to vanish-but
quick feline movements were lifting him
up broad stone steps to the level where
claire and jim stood he materialized
suddenly in the moonglow facing them
cat eyes gleaming	

  he drew one hand from his pocket
they heard the rattle of a short length
of chain he began to take slow cat-like
steps toward them

cuddenly a rushing movement
startled claire it came without warn-
ing from the hump flanking the quarry
she turned to see a terrorized face limned
white in the moonlight-the haggard fea-
tures of agda cliffe the woman was
wildly flinging herself forward she
hurled herself not at claire but at the
man at claires side

  jim

  jim turned too late from the threat of
hugo cliffes stare the womans mad
thrust propelled him sideward he tot-
tered on the stony brink striving desper-
ately to keep his balance-but he could
not a strained cry of horror broke from
claires lips as he dropped a hard
crunching sound came out of the deep
darkness she looked down to see jim
lying on the next ledge sprawled motion-
less his forehead marked by a bleeding
gash

  a snarl of fury turned claire as agda
cliffe rushed at her claire threw herself
from the yawning cavity fighting to es-
cape the womans clawing hands she
backed striking desperately with small
hard fists the cool fury of her attack
cut through the womans wild grappling
agda cliffe groaned and fell forward
her head struck stone with a sharp crack-
ing sound she rolled face up and lay
still-and claire conscious of a paralyz-
ing power looked up to see hugo cliffes
feline eyes still upon her

  he had not moved his gaze had not
wavered he was standing near the edge
of the shelf one hand extended holding
the short length of chain

  he came toward claire with panther
tread the force of his eyes held her as
he brought the chain closer she knew
that once his hands fastened upon her she
could not hope to escape his superhuman
strength once his arms crushed around
her she would become a captive of death
she could feel the cold iron links draw-


dime mystery magazine

mg around her throat growing tighter
tighter  as the chain crushed deep
into her flesh strangling her she could
hear the metallic tap-tap of the link being
closed   

  she hurled herself at cliffe all the
strength of her numb muscles exerted it-
self in the leap that threw her weight up-
on him the jar of her pulsing body
against his made the chain jangle she let
herself drop as she felt his fingers snatch-
ing at her shoulder emptiness opened
beneath her she clutched frantically at
the edge of rock supporting herself while
scarcely aware of it as a succession of
crunching thuds sounded below her

  then silence claire hung at the limit
of her arms flat against a sheer stone
wall suspended only by the strength of
her fingers she could not see how deep
the drop was below her she felt the
depths claiming her as the muscles of her
fingers yielded in spite of all her efforts
to hold them in place the black despair
enveloping her was swept away suddenly
by a crazy joy that came with a whis-
pered call

   claire    claire   

  jim was all right he was hurt but
alive jim    claire felt her fingers
sliding she was letting go    letting go

  hard fingers gripped her wrists she
hung limp feeling powerful muscles lift-
ing her hugo cliffe-the name haunted
her whirling mind she was being
dragged back to the shelf as though her
weight were nothing hugo cliffe   

  from below came faintly claire   
claire   

  a firm chesty voice called down shes
okay forester

  lieut korbert claire gazed at him
incredulously dizzying relief surging
through her mind he had turned from
her he was looking down over the brink
of the quarry she saw the thing he was

gazing at so intently-a huddled figure
lying on the edge of the lowest ledge

  it was a broken thing that had rolled
down step by step it was moving slow-
ly under the instinctive pull of crushed
muscles as claire watched in horror it
rolled over the edge broke the surface of
the silver water vanished among glimmer-
ing ripples

  ive been working on this case for
months lieut korbert said matter-of-
factly but i never suspected it was hugo
cliffe

laires arm tightened snugly around
 jims shoulders as they sat by the
fireplace reading the yellowed page of an
old diary it was the first of all the day-
to-day records claires father had kept
it had yielded the secret of hugo cliffe
and the choking death

  the entry written when barnett baird
was a boy told its story in an immature
scrawl

    last night the house was robbed again
  the thief has been robbing houses all over
  the neighborhood and has never been seen
  this is the second time he has robbed us
  he got away with a good sum of money
  father thinks he knows who did it he
  found a footprint on the floor under the
  open window and he says its stone dust
  father thinks simon cliffe is the thief   

  days later another entry read

     a horrible thing happened today i dont
  like to think about it because hugo cliffe
  is my chum and i dont want to lose him
  as a friend because of what has happened
  between our fathers

    today father accused simon cliffe of
  being the burglar he had the police with
  him and the police searched the workshop
  they found some of the money stolen from
  this house that proved simon cliffe was
  the burglar the police were very hard on
  him they put handcuffs on him-old slave
  cuffs connected by about a foot of chain
  they took him away hugo and i saw them
necklaces for the dying



  do it it hurt hugo so much he couldnt
  say anything-he ran away to he alone

    hugo and i were together when we heard
  about the horrible thing that happened
  while the police were taking hugos father
  to jail he made a desperate escape he hid
  in a field while they hunted for him when
  they found him he was dead he had killed
  himself by wrapping the chain of the hand-
  cuffs around his neck they brought him
  back to the house and hugo saw him his
  face terribly swollen and with the marks of
  the charn on his throat hugo went sort of
  crazy he jumped on me and yelled your
  fathers to blame-ill make you pay for it
  someday

  the ring of the telephone drew claire
the voice of lieut korbert brisk and
chesty came over the line

  -weve found the stolen tools buried
in his shop ive just got word from the
barracks that agda cliffe has confessed
theres dr hunts statement too-as to
how he recognized cliffe when cliffe
jumped on him coming along the road
 the docs feeling lots better today
by the way everything taken together
proves hugo cliffe was guilty all the way
through-but i never would have be-
lieved it otherwise can you come over
with your husband mrs forester we
need you to identify the tools

  claire walked with jim along the high-
way behind them the grey cat trailed
the girl had lost all fear of him and her
heart was completely free of the dread
that had haunted her the menace of the
choking death was a horror of the past
the future was made clear and bright by
the promise of wealth to be dug from the
good earth at the side of the man she
loved claire felt a joyous boundless
sense of freedom

  but when she paused just inside the
door of the stoneworkers shop it flooded
back upon her for one brief moment-
the horror of the strangling death that
might have claimed her and jim the
police had torn up the floor searched
every corner of the shed one of the
tombstones moved from the wall stood
opposite the broken door its face bore
a mocking inscription

       hugo cliffe
       born may  
       died

  it awaited the grave of the craftsman
in stone-but the date of death it lacked
must be filled in now by another hand

deaths warm fireside

malcolm slade was coming home through biting cold and heavy
strangely clinging snowdrifts he was returning tardily to the girl
he had loved and lost

over the lights of newton a mile
away an evening star glittered
like blue ice with a lamp behind
it blue-black was the early night sky
blue-white the thick drifts of snow that
mantled the open countryside that same


snow crunched under malcolm slades
feet like singing particles of glass as he
cut across the woodlot at the south end of
the slade farm and walked wearily un-
steadily toward the house

  god it was coldl it was blue-cold to
deaths warm fireside



the eye as well as paralyzingly chill to the
senses he shivered and thrust hands he
could scarcely feel deeper into his coat
pockets he hunched his shoulders higher
so that his coat collar should fit more
closely around his neck

  cold cold cold and the house would
be cold too-shut up and unoccupied for a
little while as it had been

  he shrugged philosophically well that
was his fault the house wouldnt be
shut untenanted if he hadnt lost that
quick temper of his with the passage of
a little time he was ready to admit now
that claire had been right hed been a
fool to fling himself angrily out of the
house and leave her to go to her folks

  but he could see how still and black and
drear the house looked across the white-
drifted fields and that hurt the house
had been so homely and comfortable look-
ing just a short while ago before he had
quarrelled with claire now it looked   

  never think it had been lived in mal-
colm slade muttered laboriously he felt
that if he didnt talk aloud do something
like that he would sink into the drifts and
float off in the sleep that precedes
freezing

  never think it had been lived in but
just a little while ago  

tt had been in the late fall that hed

  left scarcely six weeks before this
period the height of winter the last of
the leaves had been eddying in cheery
piles before their porch the big fireplace
had been singing its message of warmth
and benevolence for those fortunate
enough to live in the old farm home

  slade got to the meadow fence with
the black bleak farm house only a hun-
dred yards away he climbed the fence
fell heavily on the other side in the snow
he had to fight his cold-drugged senses
to make himself rise and he groaned as

he thought of what the house would be
within an empty house in winter always
seems even more bitterly cold than the
temperature outside

  well hed light fires get the thing go-
ing again then he thought hazily hed
get in touch with claire and theyd pick
up where they had left off it was a nice
little farm they had proved that a good
living could be taken from it and it was
perfect for the boy they were going to
have   

  fool he mumbled biting his lips
to keep his eyes from closing we have
everything right in our hands claire and
i and i tossed it away    but shell
come around she wont let a few weeks
break our whole lives ill tell her it was
all my fault   

  he went past the barn staggering a
little and now he was so cold that his
eyes were playing him tricks he thought
he saw the outlines of the old barn waver
thought he could see the stars through it
in places

  this is getting serious he told him-
self throwing his weary shoulders back
and taking his hands from his pockets to
beat them together god i wish i was
coming into a warm house instead of a
freezing one   

  and into a home instead of a bleak
shell that looked in the eerie moonlight
like a great empty tomb his mind went
on with his thought

  he went to his knees in a drift near the
front door of the dark house got up
again

  claire he called tongue thick voice
hoarse

  then he got a grip on his wavering
senses this wouldnt do calling to
claire like that as if at his call she
would open the door and he would see her
as he had seen her so many times in their
life here in a trim house dress face
flushed with heat from the coal range but


dime mystery magazine

beautiful nevertheless arms opened to
him   

  but shell be back again soon slade
muttered ill get the house warm and
things straightened again    place can
go to pieces in a few weeks  shell come
back

  he climbed the porch there were only
three steps but they were a hard struggle
he took them a step at a time and leaned
against a porch post and panted for a full
minute after he had accomplished them

  leaning there he saw lights across the
road a few hundred yards away

  new house he muttered in surprise
well old gleason got it built did he
put it up in a hurry whea he did get
started nice for claire and me to have
closer neighbors

  mechanically senselessly he tried the
door it was locked of course claire
wouldnt leave it unlocked when she left
after his abrupt and angry departure
and the other doors would be tightly fast-
ened too

  he walked along the porch to a window
it was one of the living room windows
he tried it with almost frozen fingers it
did not budge nailed shut probably

  for a moment maudlin self pity seized
him coming through the freezing night
like this alone and cold to a house that
was nailed and locked against him and
that would be freezing within anyhow 

  hell he muttered its your own
fault its like this now get in there and
go to work

  there seemed no way short of violence
for him to get in he took off his felt hat
wadded it around his right hand and
smashed it through the window then he
picked out the sharp pieces that clung to
the sash and slithered through

tnside the living room he stood blan-
  keted in total darkness

  cold inside yes but ia this house

that had known no heat for a time the
cold ate into his very heart it sent ice
needles through his flesh attacked him
like a living bitter thing

  he searched through his pockets for
matches found them at last two dropped
from his stiff fingers but the third he
managed to hold he stared around in
the dim light it cast

  he could see practically nothing and he
wondered for an instant if his eyeballs
had frozen he had heard of such things
but that was preposterous the kind of
thing that happened only in arctic cold
not the zero weather of ohio the match
threw a poor light that was all

  nevertheless he shrank from the
shadows its yellow flame produced shad-
ows that seemed to creep slowly toward
him from all four sides of the room
hemming him in poising as though to
leap

  he shuddered again and now not en-
tirely because of the cold then he started
and dropped the match stub had that
been a step upstairs

  he listened in the darkness and heard
it again a distinct creak as if a persons
weight had been pressed against a board
in the big bedroom

  for an instant a wild hope seized him
that was claire he was here she   

  fool here in this icy place with no
light on and no fire going its a board
creaking with the cold thats all

  he walked toward the stairs off the
little hall between living room and dining
room he didnt bother to light another
match he knew the way perfectly he
went slowly only because there might be
some piece of furniture out of its accus-
tomed place between him and the hall

  the place was alive with memories of
claire he kept seeing her in this hall
doorway calling him to dinner he kept
visioning the living room warm and
cheery as she had furnished and arranged
deaths warm fireside



it he kept seeing claire and himself sit-
ting before the leaping flames in the fire-
place talking of the boy that was to
come   

  his steps resounded in the bleak house
like giant drum-beats he tried to walk
on tiptoe appalled by the noise but he
was too shaky with cold and weariness
from the distance he had walked to make
it so he shuffled over the bare floor of
the little hall and noisily climbed the
stairs

  the second floor was if anything cold-
er than the first he realized that at last
the bitter chill was really getting him
but even as he realized that he found
himself sinking to the top step

  he sat there leaning against the newel
post chin on his chest

  got to get up he said thickly aloud

  but he made no move it was so pleas-
ant to sit to give in for just a moment
to his lassitude hed get up in a minute
and get some fire going with the living
room stove red hot and the fireplace go-
ing the first floor would warm up in a
hurry have to get some wood in

  a sound from downstairs penetrated
his stupor and as he really heard it he
straightened quickly this was not a
fancied sound nor one made by cold-con-
tracting boards it was real and startling 

  it was the sound of flames the crackling
of fire

  my god the matches i lit- slade
thought

  he started drunkenly down the stairs
the little hall was already bright with the
rosy glow of naked fire he stumbled into
the living room   

  there are moments too big too mar-
velous to be borne and this one as slade
stood in the living room doorway was
one of them

  mouth open eyes wide he stared at
the transformed room

  the fire that had sent its light into the

hall was from the big fireplace a great
pile of wood was roaring there with logs
atop to send out even heat when the
kindling had burned the stove in the
center of the room was already black-hot
and laving him with warmth the bright
lamps on the table near the front door
were lit and on the stove a pot was
steaming that slade knew contained hot
rum

  and beside the stove stood claire

  her blue eyes were alight as she stared
at him though they were suspiciously
moist her red young lips were half parted
her heart was in her face and staring at it
slade knew he was already forgiven

  surprise- claire called tears spill-
ing from her eyes	
but slades knees were folding under
him he slid to the threshold and lay with
his head inside the living room and his
feet in the little hall

q lades head was in claires lap when
k he again became aware of things she
was holding him to her calling him all
the endearing terms theyd thought up
during their five years of married life

  darling she whispered when his eyes
opened he saw fear in her own eyes 
saw it fade into gladness when he looked
at her	j

  mai i was afraid    you looked
almost as if you were dead

  kind of a shock whispered slade 
staring at claires face as though he could
not get his fill of it i didnt dream you
were here too it looked like no one was
here all cold and dark like it was
claires eyes expressive as open books
lighted again

  i wasnt here when you broke in mai

i was at mr gleasons ive been staying
there watching waiting for you to come
back i saw a light in here-	j

  i struck some matches to see my way j
around


dime mystery magazine

  i saw the light dear and came over i
came in as quietly as i could and lit the
fires i wanted to surprise you

  slade sat up he didnt want to take his
head from its comfortable position but
he was afraid claire would think him ill
or feeble from the cold if he lay where he
was any longer

  it was a surprise all right he told
her the most gorgeous one    but
it kind of knocked me out so far from
what i expected and everything  

  they looked at each other for a long
while then their two bodies that had
been so close so many times swayed
toward each other they kissed eyes
closed all quarrels melting in the word-
less agreement

  so yon were waiting for me mar-
velled slade

  i was waiting for you nodded
claire it seemed a very long time
mai

  well now im home and well carry
on ill get to work tomorrow and clear
things up    claire what did we quar-
rel about

  she shook her head smiling

  i cant even remember but it doesnt
matter anyway we wont quarrel again
youve come home and so have i with-
out the two of us the place is just a
house cold and bleak and deserted with
us it is a home again

  the flames in the fireplace leaped and
roared the stove behind them hummed
with heat slade felt a little drowsy

- claire handed him a glass of the hot
rum that had steamed on the stove he
sipped at it floundering through snow
drifts toward a house as cold and empty
as his own heart had been since he left
yes he had been doing that and only a
little while ago but it seemed years ago
now in the light of his present warmth
and comfort

  he was so warm so comfortable he

let himself drift into a sort of dreamlike
state with claire warm in his arms

  youre kind of wonderful he whis-
pered to her

  and it was then that their bodies drew
closer still and he knew again the poig-
nant sweetness of the woman he had mar-
ried and had been stupid enough to leave
awhile ago

  outside a frigid wind began to moan
over the blue-cold world but the only
effect it had in the warm room was to
make the raw flame in the fireplace leap
higher and the warm stove hum more
loudly

  youve missed me he whispered at
last greedy for the look on her face to be
translated into words

  so much she whispered back run-
ning her young smooth hands lightly
down his stubbled cheek but now
youre here and i know youll never
leave again

puriously now a little chill stole
down his spine her words were
natural the kind of thing she would tend
to say but there was something about
her tone that struck him as a little odd
it had such extreme conviction in it she
knew he would never leave her again she
had said it as though he were now chained
to her by some circumstance stronger
than earthly will

  but the uneasy feeling faded soon why
shouldnt she have conviction in her tone
she was right wasnt she he never
would be separated from her again not
while he was in his right mind

  so warm and comfortable before the
fireplace  so contented with claire
again by his side in his arms   

  malcolm slade felt himself slide again
into a sort of dreamlike trance

  kiss me whispered claire

  dreamily he kissed her

  so glad im home he said finally
deaths warm fireside



eyes sagging closed as though weights
pulled down the lids so glad  

  he dimly saw claire smile there was
everything in her smile a man dreams of
getting from a woman

  youre sleepy darling arent you i
dont blame you the cold outside the
bitter bitter cold inside before i got the
fires going your long walk now this
warmth   her voice was a lullaby
closing his eyes more securely still

  sleep mai sleep and know youll
never be away from me again sleep   

  the fire was sending dim red even
through his closed eyelids carrying him
off to unconsciousness with the feeling
that all was right in a world that had not
been too kind to him of late

 sleep

  crackling fire claire everything
slipped into a slumber as comforting as
it was profound

tthe rather creditable newton fire en-
gine panted in the snow-packed lane
beside the farm house its hose was
out and the volunteer firemen half a
dozen of them were helmeted and in rub-
ber slickers ready to attack the roaring
blaze that soared through the roof twice
as high as the house it was consuming

  but there was no way for them to at-
tack it there was no water in the well

behind the house and the nearby creek
was frozen solid

  have to let er burn said one of the
men no loss anyway

  a sedan slid up through the snow and
stopped behind the fire engine a man
got out the newtown doctor allen
lutz

  bill you phoned there was a man
here who needed me he said

  the man he addressed shook his head
a little

  no work for you now doc the guy
died a few minutes after i phoned from
gleasons without ever coming to

  the men parted lutz bent over a stark
figure on a heap of coats in the snow he
felt the figures chest

  dead all right who is he

  one of the others shrugged

  just some old tramp none of us has
ever seen him before we found him lying
in the burning house

  in there said doctor lutz staring
incredulously at the almost demolished
building in the roofless old ruin
yeah i cant figure out why i
shouldnt think even an old drunk like
this bum would try for shelter there the
house has been falling to pieces since i
was a kid-ever since mrs malcolm

in both sinewy paws the great shoulders

ing free to get at them with wild
shrieks they bolted stampeded in blind
panic knocking one another down in their
desperate flight

  minna clutched kincaids arm but a
wild-eyed man dived between them and
another knocked her off balance then she
was down and the crowd was streaming
past her sweeping hartley with them an-
other moment and the pavement in front of
the cage was deserted except for minna
trying to get to her feet-and the great
ape that was lurching toward her

  she heard women screaming heard
men shouting to her to run saw a uni-
formed zoo attendant gaping at her help-
lessly-but she could not move a muscle
she seemed turned to stone-stone that
shook in terror as death loomed above her

  and then hartley was there beside her
cool and collected speaking calmly almost
persuasively-to the gorilla

  no-no he was saying quietly no
    ft

-no

  the lumbering ape hesitated crouched
on its haunches and looked puzzledly into
those eyes that were fixed so steadily
upon it gradually the snarl began to
fade from its face

  good-good hartley said in the
same quiet tone and then made queer
animal noises deep in his throat

  slowly and easily he walked toward the
gorilla speaking to it all the while then
his open hand touched its shoulder patted
it and the red eyes looked up into his
with what almost seemed to be under-
standing  he reached down and touched

the open paw patted it lifted it-and
started leading the ape back to the cage
where a quick-witted attendant was
spreading out an inviting array of food

  for long minutes the tense hair-trigger
drama had held the watching crowd spell-
bound then as the gorilla squeezed its
way back into the cage the breathless si-
lence was broken by a roar of applause
and hartley was bending over her help-
ing her to stand on weak trembling legs

  the danger was past and minna could
feel the crushing terror lifting like a great
weight from her shoulders-but in its
place came a weird reaction that sent a
shiver through her what she had just
witnessed was unnatural-uncanny it
wasnt human for a man to exert such an
influence over a savage beast something
deep down within her shuddered away
from it and she recoiled unconsciously
when his hands touched her

  then the strange reaction was gone
forgotten and she was in his arms but
the next day it came back to her and she
shivered unreasonably as she read a state-
ment by one of the zoo attendants in the
morning paper

  if i hadnt seen it myself i wouldnt
believe it he was quoted as saying mr
kincaid has more influence with apes than
any man ive ever known he handled
that gorilla as if he knew it-almost as
if-well as if he was one of its own kind
and could think the way it did

hphat near tragedy was now three
months past but it all came back to
minna with crystal clearness as she read
and reread hartleys letter he was at
his fathers remote estate in the wildest
part of the adirondack foothills but he
was to have come back to town to spend
the four-day holiday week-end with her
at the seashore his friend don porter
and dons fiancee alice marvin were
to have completed the party-but now
hartley wasnt going to be back
brides for the beast

mr--



  dad feels that he is on the verge of a
great discovery and you know i am an
integral part of his experiments he
wrote so i really cant run out on him
for almost a week right now instead i
want you three to drive up here and pick
me up then well go to my lodge and
spend a couple of days there

  minna frowned it wasnt that she did
not like hartleys mountain lodge it was
an adorable place and she was almost as
fond of it as he was but the prospect
of going to professor kincaids home
even if only to pick up hartley was not
inviting it filled her with vague uneasi-
ness

  professor kincaid was a strange re-
ticent man and she was never comfortable
in his presence he was an anthropol-
ogist who was devoting himself to an ex-
haustive series of researches into simian
life and development so immersed was
lie in his subject that he had become ec-
centric  he seemed hardly human-scarce-
ly more than an automaton

  he gave minna the creeps-and the
thought of hartley forming part of his
experiments being studied and probed by
this queer impersonal old man did not
add to her peace of mind she had only
a vague idea of what those experiments
were like but what she conjured up in her
mind gave her no desire to visit the place
where they were conducted

  there was another reason why minna
dreaded going to professor kincaids es-
tablishment-august gebhardt his assist-
ant gebhardt was a german a blond
bullet-headed prussian and he made no
effort to conceal his desire for her even
though he knew she was engaged to kin-
caids son

  minna had never liked him and she
liked him even less for the past few
months he had little liking for hartley
she knew but there was certainly no ex-
cuse for the unthinkable things he had
hinted at

  ever since that accident in the zoo he
had been unbearable minnas little nose
wrinkled with distaste and her eyes be-
came frosty as she remembered how he
had read the account in the paper and then
looked up at her significantly

  a most remarkable occurrence he
murmured it hardly seems human i
would not believe that a man could wield
such an influence over a beast

  there were other things too not the
words so much as the inflection the crafty
cocking of his head the knowing nod-
as if he knew a great deal that had better
remain unspoken

  gebhardt had made several attempts to
declare his affection but so far minna had
managed to avoid a direct avowal but
how much longer she would be able to do
that was a question  it was much better to
avoid the man and the chance of an un-
pleasant scene

   so between the professor and his assist-
ant there was little to tempt her to the
kincaid place-not to mention the reputa-
tion of the establishment itself there
were queer stories whispered about that
gloomy backwoods retreat wild tales
about the professor and his experiments

  once a few years ago he had even
broken into the columns of the metropoli-
tan newspapers when the mangled body
of a young girl was found near his place
his angry backwoods neighbors claimed
that she had been slain by one of the apes
the professor kept penned up in his lab-
oratory but he convinced the authorities
that his animals could not possibly have
escaped to commit the deed hartley had
been with him at the time and minna
noticed that he was strangely worried and
unnerved when he came back to the city

  not a very pleasant place to visit but
minna shrugged if it was all right with
the others she would not object and it
was all right with them

i sort of expected this don laughed
when informed of the change in plans i


dime mystery magazine

didnt think wed be able to drag that
tarzan of yours down to the seashore
hes never happy unless hes up in the
woods regular forest-dweller that

guy

  oddly that jesting remark struck
minna as strangely significant hartley
did have little use for the seashore for
water sports of any sort his mountain
lodge was his idea of heaven his ideal
playground the woods

  minna caught herself up short and gave
herself a figurative shaking what sort
of ridiculous thinking was this it was
those preposterous insinuations august
gebhardt had insidiously planted in her
mind do what she would she could not
get rid of them or throw off the feeling of
uneasiness of apprehension they cast over
her

tt stayed with her as dons car sped

  through the bright morning sunshine
and increased when early twilight brought
the adirondacks closing in around them
today those tree-covered hillsides were
depressing they lowered above her
ominously closed in threateningly it
would be a relief when they reached kin-
caids and picked up hartley minna
wanted him beside her wanted the reas-
suring touch of his hand the sound of his
voice-

  the only objection i have to this place
is the ungodly trip you have to make to
get here don interrupted her thoughts
as he brought the car to a halt seems

i	never can negotiate it without losing the
way god only knows where we are now
looks as if this roads going to become
a deer-run in a few minutes

  theres a light ahead there to the
right alice pointed out maybe they
can put us back on the right road

  the light came from what proved to be
a general store in the center of a straggling
village that appeared to consist of no more
than a dozen scattered houses as the car

  braked to a stop in front of the building
men came surging out on the wooden
porch a surprising number for a place
of that size minna noticed at once she
counted twenty-and some of them carried
shotguns

  wonder if you can tell me how to
reach professor kincaids place don
asked them all in general

  but only silence answered him-cold
silence that was made unmistakably hos-
tile by the surly gleam of their eyes

  we seem to have lost our way- don
began again and then his voice faded
away before that almost palpable hostility
there was something terribly wrong here
something-

   ye want to go to the perfessors eh
a bewhiskered old-timer finally said while
his neighbors eyed him uncertainly
friends of his be ye

  dons admission brought from the
crowd of hillmen a low growl that swelled
into an angry rumble but the old fellow
paid no attention to it

   wall ye just stick to this here road
he went on until ye come to the first
turnin take the right hand fork pretty
bad road fer a spell but itll git ye where
ye wanta go

  don thanked him and threw the car
into gear for a moment minna was sure
that the men were going to step out in
front of the machine and stop them with
those shotguns then they were under
way-but as she looked back she saw
that the hillmen still stood watching them
as the light of the store dimmed in the
distance

  the road grew steadily rougher and
bumpier until the girls had to cling to
the sides of the car to keep from being
tossed around the right hand fork proved
to be even worse-almost impassable in
spots

   dont believe anything on wheels ever
went through here don groaned as he
f brides for the beast



clung to the wheel and ground forward
in low gear what the-

  he jammed his foot on the brake as a
lanky dark-bearded figure suddenly
loomed up in the beam of the headlights
the fellows hand was raised in a com-
mand to stop and his face was grim as he
strode over to the side of the car

  dont know where ye think yere go-
in he announced but i want ye to
help me

  a shriek of agony ripped through the
silence and the old fellows gnarled hand
tightened on the side of the car

  thats my darter nancy he said
huskily shes gonna have a baby-
havin a turrible time with it-an the
doctor from town aint showed up yet
lessn he gets here mighty quick its
gonna be too late-so i want ye to turn
around an drive back an fetch him
mister

  it wasnt a request it was a grim com-
mand but don wilted at the prospect
of going back over that impossible road

  i cant make any time he argued
you can walk faster than i can drive this
car-

  but the lanky hillman had unlatched
the door and was starting to crowd in
under the wheel-when another burst of
agony shrilled and quavered through the
night the sheer torment in that scream
sent a cold chill down minnas spine she
knew well enough what it meant

  theres no use going for the doctor
now she said as she hopped out of the
car there wont be time im a nurse
and ill see what i can do if you will take
me to her

  minna scarcely needed a guide the
girls blood-chilling cries blazed a trail
straight to the crude shack where she lay
writhing in agony as they came in the
girl half raised on her bed and gazed at
them with feverish eyes

  it wasnt a monkey critter she
gasped it wasnt a monkey critter i

tell ye-it was human and then another
spasm of agony rocked her and twisted
her words into distorted moans

  the poor thing was delirious minna
thought that was the only explanation for
her raving about this monkey critter
again and again the insistence that some-
thing or someone was not a monkey but
human gradually minna began to un-
derstand that the girl was talking abou
the father of her nearly born child-and
the chilling tentacles of grisly horror be-
gan to wrap themselves around her

  fortunately the doctor a rugged little
country practitioner arrived before the
child was born he took charge and
minna noticed that his eyes became bleak
as he listened to that delirious raving she
tried hard to catch more of the girls words
and make sense of them but the disjointed
raving told her nothing more-until the
newborn infant lay in the doctors hands

  and then stark horror gripped her en-
veloped her utterly

  fascinated she stared at the dead mon-
strosity while her mind reeled away from
what she saw it was a huge child its
arms and legs were long and gangling
there was a thin covering of dark hair
all over its body and its face-

  those flat widespread features were
unmistakably simian

  minna heard a low curse escape from
the doctors lips as he swung around and
tried to hide the thing from the girl on
the bed but he was too late she had
already seen-and now her brown eyes
were two great brimming pools of in-
credulous horror

  a low choking moan bubbled up from
her throat gasped from her open mouth
then came words slow and deliberate in
a voice that was insistent yet pathetically
pleading-as if she were arguing with
herself striving desperately to convince
herself of something that must be so

  but it was a human critter o god it
was her low words throbbed through

the still room as her eyes closed wearily
and she slumped to the bed to join in death
the grotesque thing to which she had given
birth

chapter two

prey of the beast

ttor long moments the silence held as
they stood beside the bed and looked
down at the dead girl minna forgot that
she was part of it rather it was as if
she were a spectator looking into a room
where something unthinkably horrible has
just occurred

  it wasnt the girls death death alone
would have been clean and final a blessed
relief this was something else some-
thing incredible and unholy something
that clung noisomely to the room even
after the girls spirit had fled its taint
held them mute in the presence of horror
they could not put into words

  then the bearded parent shuffled over
to the table on which the infants body lay
horror and disgust were mirrored in his
working features to give place to bitter
rage

  human-hell he snarled its a
monkey-an one of kincaids critters is
its father

  that broke the spell and only then did
minna realize that other eyes had been
regarding them eyes in the windows
and at the door now the owners of those
eyes shuffled in and gathered around the
table to stare down at the monstrosity in
awe that quickly kindled into savage rage

  she recognized several faces among
them they were the same men she had
seen back in the straggling little town
now they were all armed with guns or
clubs and the hard stares they directed at
the three strangers were filled with menace

  thank god my betsy died afore she
give birth to a thing like that one of
them exclaimed and minna saw that it

was the old fellow who had directed them
my pore gal was only dead--ripped to
pieces-with her dead fingers still grip-
pin the black hairs she pulled out of the
critters dirty hide but the lot of ye let
the perfessor lie his way out of it-let
him keep those murderin apes here in the
hills-an this is what ye get fer it

  his face twitched and his old eyes
blazed as he swung around on the others

  an this aint all he raved wait
till we find your gal jeff muzzey a
gal in this country dont disappear for two
days an come back safe the apes got
her-an when ye find her yell wish to
god ye never did

  jeff muzzey a red-haired giant quailed
under that withering prediction and the
color drained out of his ruddy face

  ef anythings happened to my daugh-
ter- his tense voice came in a deep
rumble then stopped

  his blazing eyes turned to minna and
decision flashed in them before she
could move he leaped across the room and
grabbed her by the wrist

  weve stood enough o kincaids mur-
derin critters he said grimly im
holdin this gal until we find my dorrie-
an if-if anythings happened to dorrie
-god help this one

  that was the spark that set off the ex-
plosion that opened the floodgates for
pent-up passions don porter sprang for-
ward and tried to push the fellow away
from minna but in the next moment he
was down helplessly battling half a dozen
men who struggled to get at him minna
felt rough hands grab at her and hold
her felt hard fingers pinch into her arms
as she stared aghast at what had suddenly
become a bloodthirsty mob slavering for
the blood of people they had never even
seen until an hour ago

  rough hands seized alice and held her
helpless angry fists flailed out at don
and the bewhiskered old-timer whose
tirade had started this frenzy shouted en-
brides for the beaut



couragement and heaped fuel oh the blaze
only one man in the room kept his head

  above tlie din the doctors voice rang
out authoritatively

  let those people alone you fools  he
commanded what did they do to you
if you feel so much like fighting go up
and tackle the professors apes-not a
couple of girls thought you were sup-
posed to be out looking for dorrie muz-
zeyi well youre not gonna find her in
here-and while youre wasting time god
only knows whats happening to her

  the lash of his voice snapped at them
penetrated their rage-befogged brains and
slowly common sense began to reassert
itself the hillmen fell back abashed
but even as they released her minna saw
that their glances were bitter

  you came along here at a very un-
fortunate time the doctor said as don
got to his feet after whats been going
on in these hills these men can hardly be
blamed for flying off tlie handle hut old
stevens shouldnt have sent you up this
road he did that out of pure cussedness
it will get you up to kincaids all right-
in fact youre within half a mile of the
place now-but the roads in very bad
shape hasnt been used for years

  and if we go back and around tlie
other way don groaned

  ten or twelve miles the doctor ad-
mitted guess you might as well go on
this way as long as youve come this far
wait a minute ill get you a guide hey
tully he called to a young husky who
was just going out of the cabin sup-
pose you ride up to the kincaid place
with these people you can take them up
and at the same time keep your eyes open
for any sign of dorrie along this back
road

co when they drove on tully walters
rode on the running board of the coupe
beside don clinging to the side of the car
as k pitched in and out of ruts his eyes

never leaving the lighted road in front of
them

  dorries my gal he confided as they
bumped along she aint been home-
aint been seen-since yesterday morning
that aint like dorrie if she was a-goin
anywhere shed a told me about it

  minna listened to his anxious voice and
studied the silhouette of his worried face
etched against the background of the dark
road her heart went out to him and
she shuddered at the memory of the dead
girl back in the cabin they had just left
what a ghastly tragedy-to go through
the excruciating agony of motherhood to
bring such an abomination into the world 

  somewhere in this black wilderness was
tlie creature that was responsible for that
tragedy could it be that it was really a
beast-an ape a horrible monster that
caught and violated young girls and left
their mangled bodies as gruesome evidence
of its bloodthirsty lust

  minna remembered the red hate-flar-
ing eyes of that monster in the zoo  re-
membered the way it came lunging toward
her-and suddenly tine darkness that
hemmed her in was filled with staring eyes
with hairy arms that were ready to reach
out and grab her she fought to control
her panic but instinctively she shied away
from the open car window and pressed
closer to alice until she could feel her
friends trembling arm her ice-cold fin-
gers fear huddled there in the car with
diem

   but the dying girl -had insisted that the
father of her child wasnt a beast-that it
was human what had she meant by
that didnt she know for sure was it
some sort of weird half-beast that was
neither man nor ape some impossible
creature that was able to change its form
and pass as both man and beast 

  that was inconceivable but minna
shivered at the thought and wished with
all her heart thait she had not come on this
trip intuition had warned her not to


dime mystery magazine

come to this place perhaps this unnatu-
ral monster was the spawn of one of the
professors unholy experiments per-
haps-

  suddenly tully walters hand shot out
and gripped dons arm

  stop the car he whispered tensely
look over there at the side of the
road did ye see that-

  the motor died as don flicked the
switch and stepped on the brake the car
stopped settled with a faint metallic sigh
-and the stillness settled down around
them stillness so-absolute that minna
could hear the pounding of her heart and
the panicky sough of alices quickly
drawn breath

  the world became a circle of light in
the midst of surrounding blackness-a
ring of glaring radiance into which she
stared until her burning eyes seemed to be
standing out of her head and then she
saw it

  full in the glare of the headlights was
a snarling black face a bullet head
hunched between great shoulders a huge
hairy body for a fraction of a second
the ape crouched at the edge of the brush
and glowered at them then it heaved
itself forward-and a heavy rock smashed
into the windshield driving murderous
splinters of glass all about the helpless oc-
cupants

  minna ducked behind the protection of
the dashboard as another rock crashed
against the hood of the car she saw
tully walters spring from the running
board then don snapped off the lights
and the narrow road was plunged into
darkness

  out of that darkness came the sounds
of the fearsome creatures flight and of
walters threshing pursuit growing faint-
er in the distance behind the wrecked
windshield the girls clutched each other
and cowered in terror until don pulled a
flashlight from a side pocket and climbed
out of the car

  im going after him he announced
quietly i cant let him face that thing
alone youll be all right here-

  but minna was already out of the car
dragging alice with her

  dont be silly don she said firmly
were going with you thats much
better than waiting here in the darkness
don did not argue with his flashlight
he searched the side of the road until he
found the place where the ape had
crouched and then a faint path leading
back into the brush slowly he led the
way along this hardly discernible trail
the noise up ahead of them had dwindled
and then stopped altogether again the
wilderness was quiet the heavy stillness
broken only by the sounds of the night in-
sects and the noise of their own progress

  it was better when there was a noise
up ahead at least then they knew where
the creature was now it might be any-
where around them in the darkness ready
to pounce on them as they passed minna
cringed and could fairly feel the huge
black paws fastening on her hunched
shoulders-

  a yell burst through the stillness and
her blood turned to ice it was tully
walters right up ahead there somewhere
and his shout of surprise was strangling
in his throat turning to a howl of pain
and terror

  don started to run but they did not
have far to go a few steps farther ahead
and they could see the flickering light of
a low fire dons warning hand pressed
them back as they reached the edge of a
little clearing-but he could not shut off
the sight of the frightful thing that was
going on out there in the firelight nor
close their ears to the bloody gurgle that
was tully walters death-cry

  the huge apes bloody paws were tear-
ing at the mans throat mangling it hor-
ribly while the warm blood spurted out
and drenched its shaggy coat then with
a bestial snarl it dropped the limp body
brides for the beast



and stood glaring around the dearing

  could it see in the darkness-see right
through the thin brush behind which they
were crouching minna felt as if the
creatures eyes were looking right into her
own as if-

  it was coming straight toward them
bloody paws swinging at its sides ugly
head lowered it lunged awkwardly across
the clearing until it was only yards away
from their hiding place then sudden-
ly it cocked its head and listened

  in her terror minna had not heard the
first call now she caught it as it was
repeated-a distant halloo without an-
other glance in their direction the ape
whirled and loped off into the brush

  not until the last faint sound of its
flight was lost in the distance would don
let them step out into the blood-spattered
clearing it took but a glance at the gap-
ing hole that had been tully walters
throat to tell them that here was nothing
they could do for him

  but the sight that caught minnas atten-
tion and brought an icy tingle of horror
to her spine was on the other side of the
clearing

  beneath a crudely constructed bower
lay the naked body of a young girl
chained by one ankle to a tree she had
been beaten tortured mutilated until her
flesh was a crimson horror-and yet she
still lived

  minna sprang forward and cradled the
battered head in her arms as she saw the
closed eyelids flicker blood frothed up
on the girls lips as she tried to speak
then the words came thick and hardly in-
telligible-while the tortures of hell
flamed in her glazing eyes

  it was-it was the perfes-

  that was as far as she got the welling
blood gurgled in her throat and her head
fell back limply dorrie muzzey would
never be able to tell who had committed
these abominations on her tender body but
she had planted horrible suspicion in the

minds of the three who bent over her

  what had she meant to say the pro-
fessor the professors ape the pro-
fessors assistant or-no god almighty
no she couldnt have meant to say the
professors son

  minna didnot dare to meet the eyes of
the others as she rose to her feet she
could not bear it if she should read in
them the terrifying suspicion that had
reared its nasty head like a venomous
snake in her own mind instead she
turned to the crudely built shelter

  it was nothing more than four poles
with crosspieces lashed over their tops and
freshly cut boughs spread over these evi-
dently it had served as a shelter for the
murderous beast-a couch from which it
could watch the suffering of its helpless
victim in the bed of leaves heaped be-
neath it were crusts of bread a gnawed
bone-yes and the stubs of cigarettes 

  an ape that smoked cigarettes

  minna looked closer - and her heart
sank sickeningly for a moment the
world swayed giddily and she was sure
she was going to faint then from some
inner spring of courage came the strength
to step forward and place her foot on the
gleaming bit of metal that had caught her
eye

  when she was sure the others would
not notice she stooped quickly and
snatched up the silver-plated mono-
grammed lighter she had given hartley
kincaid as a present the past christmas

chapter three

festering suspicion

hphe rest of that terrible ride to the
kincaid home was a torture night-
mare to minna the faces of that dead
girl in the shack and the awful thing she
had brought into the world of dorrie
muzzey and tully walters would not be
pushed out of her mind-and the lighter


dime mystery magazine

in her handbag seemed to be burning its
way right through the leather straight into
her suffering heart

  the fact that the lighter was there did
not connect hartley in any way with these
fearful atrocities she told herself again
and again but apes do not smoke cigar-
ettes a man had been there reveling in
that murder nest and that man had had
hartleys lighter

  when the enraged hillfolk found those
bodies there would be no restraining them
they would swarm up here and tear the
kincaid house down brick by brick she
told herself and as she looked up at the
gloomy brick and stone pile she knew
that she would not blame them she had
never liked the place and now it loomed
up in the darkness ahead of her like the
dwelling place of all evil

  more than twenty years ago professor
kincaid had come to this out-of-the-way
place so that he would be alone so that he
would be undisturbed in his work he
had been there ever since-and god only
knew what sort of monsters the place had
spawned in that time

  minna shuddered as the car drew up be-
neath the porte-cochere and her distaste
was in no way alleviated when the door
swung open and august gebhardt strode
out smiling to meet them at the sound
of the motor professor kincaid came
from the brick building behind the main
structure that was his laboratory and
mandy goss his housekeeper came from
her kitchen follawed by her moronic look-
ing grandson

  the kincaid household was assembled
-with the significant exception of hart-
ley

  where was he  something in the back
of minnas brain shouted the question ac-
cusingly but as she glanced at the faces
of the other she could find no answer in
them

  gebhardt was bowing and smiling oilily

while he murmured stupid compliments
professor kincaid was making the wel-
coming ceremony as brief as possible
plainly he wanted to get it over with and
return to his endless work mandy goss
a husky old woman with a sharp vitriolic
face and glittering mean-looking eyes
made no attempt to conceal her lack of
enthusiasm visitors meant more work
her biting glance said plainly enough and
corby her hulking young grandson
stared at them stupidly as if he had never
seen such surprising creatures before

  where-where is hartley minna
dreaded to frame the question that was
foremost in her mind but somehow the
words formed on her dry lips isnt he
here 

  he was until an hour or so ago geb-
hardt supplied quickly then he went
out i believe he said he was going to
meet you

  his words seemed to sap her strength
to leave her weak and trembling hartley
wasnt there he hadnt been there for
an hour or more then where was he
when that ape creature murdered tully
walters where was he where was
he

  that question kept throbbing madden-
ingly through her brain until fifteen min-
utes later hartleys car drove up beside
the house

  hello he greeted them with a grin
how did you get here i began to get
worried about you so i drove out to see
whether you had had trouble on the road
-but no sign of you anywhere dont
see how i could have missed you

  relief surged through minna of
course that was the answer he had driven
down the main road looking for them
while they were plowing along that ter-
rible back road that was where he was

  but as he took her in his arms and
kissed her he seemed like a stranger-a
stranger whom she feared instead of
brides for the beast



responding eagerly to his caresses she
wanted to draw away to shrink from him
-even though she scolded herself for her
disloyalty

  its this old house she told herself
it makes us all suspect each other once
were away from here-

  but professor kincaid dashed her hopes
for a speedy departure the moment he saw
his son

  so youre back hartley he said
quickly then lets get back to work
i know-you want to be with your guests
but if you want to get away by tomorrow
noon well have to put in several hours of
work tonight mandy has prepared a bit
of supper for them and after that they
will probably want to retire so they
wont miss you at all and there will be
plenty of time to see them in the morn-
mg

  reluctantly hartley went with him and
left minna to gebhardt which it was
very apparent delighted the professors
assistant as soon as the light supper
was finished he maneuvered her into the
library minna knew what was coming
and tried to avoid it-but this time geb-
hardt was not to be put off

  wait minna-please he begged as
she tried to excuse herself and go up to
her room there is something i must
tell you i can not wait any longer dont
you see  dont you understand  i love
you i want you to marry me to go
away with me-

  his arms were around her drawing her
to him bringing her face up to his lips
but minna fought loose and broke away
from him

  you have no right to talk to me like
that she panted you know i am en-
gaged to hartley i love him and im
going to marry him-and you can only
make things unpleasant for all of us by
going on this way

  she was at the door and was about to
open it and rush upstairs but the ex-

pression on his livid face stopped her
rage twisted his features contorted them
into a sneering snarl that was demoniac

  so you fling my proposal back in my
face he grated between clenched teeth
i am not good enough for you i sup-
pose not such an adonis as young kin-
caid well let me warn you watch your
step before you marry him or he may drag
you down into hell with him

  minna knew that she ought not to listen
that she ought to ignore his jealous raving
but something seemed to keep her rooted
there at the door incapable of opening it
against her will she looked into his blaz-
ing eyes and could almost feel their hyp-
notic attraction

  what-what do you-mean she
asked in a voice that seemed to come from
the back of her brain rather than from
her lips

  what do you know about hartley
gebhardt flung at her how about his
mother does he ever speak of her
does he know anything about her  how
do you know that the professor is his
father they resemble each other in no
way and do they act like father and
son how is it do you suppose that
hartley is so at home with the apes  how
is it that he can handle gorillas as no other
man has ever been able to do how is
it that he is so inordinately fond of the
woods and so uncomfortable indoors 

  with the stunning force and regularity
of a triphammer he hurled his questions
at her piling innuendo on innuendo until
minna reeled away from the merciless
barrage aghast at the staggering impli-
cation of the things he was saying but
gebhardt was not finished

  i have tried to spare you this by hint-
ing when i should have spoken frankly
he snapped at her now i shall answer
some of those questions for you i have
been with professor kincaid for more
than five years working with him inti-
mately and during that time i have dis-

covered no evidence that would indicate
that he ever had a wife his interest in
hartley is not that of a father in a son-
it is that of a scientist in a rare specimen
mrs goss has known the family a good
many years but her loyalty to the profes-
sor stops her from telling all that she
knows but suppose that what she insinu-
ates is true-that hartley is the son of an
ape

  like a lash laying open the skin that
unthinkable suggestion slapped into
minnas face-and like the quick blood
rushing up to the wound came the ready
promptings of her own mind

  that day at the zoo-the attendants
statement to the reporters-hartleys pas-
sion for the woods-the so-necessary part
he played in the professors experiments
one by one they flashed before her and
with them the half-formed suspicions
which gebhardts insinuations had prompt-
ed within her

  hartley the son of an ape hartley-
no it couldnt be that was madness-
the vicious invention of a brain that was
embittered and warped by jealousy geb-
hardt was lying-lying

  i wont listen to any more such lies
she blazed at him while her bosom rose
and fell with such stress that she could
hardly speak get out of here get out
-before i tell the professor what you
have dared to say

  gebhardts sneer had become cold and
fixed

  the truth hurts doesnt it he stabbed
at her as he walked toward the door es-
pecially when it is what you have known
yourself but have not had the courage
to admit

  as he stepped into the hallway he
paused and listened there was the
rumble of voices outside then heavy feet
clumped up the steps and across the ver-
anda  fists banged on the loor

  minna heard those noises and a new
fear coursed through her that must be

the hillmen they had found those mangled
bodies in the clearing and now they had
come for an accounting they had come
for revenge to kill the beast that had
murdered their kin

  like an icy blast the memory of hart-
leys lighter flashed through her that
killing monster was not a real ape it
smoked cigarettes and it carried a light-
er-hartleys lighter suppose that hart-
ley was the son of an ape

  minna grasped the side of the door for
support her face she could see in a
mirror was ashen and cold perspiration
was bathing her body in a wet clammy
blanket weak-kneed she staggered out
into the hall she had to see for herself
-had to hear-

  im a deputy sheriff she heard a
heavy voice rumble i aint got no war-
rant to search this place but if you know
whats good for ye you better not try to
stop us

  come right in gentlemen gebhardt
invited i shall be more than glad to
help you in any way i can

  would he tell the deputy his suspicions
about hartley  that enraged mob would
be only too quick to jump at conclusions
they would drag hartley out to the near-
est tree fear clutched at minnas throat
threatened to choke her while her head
throbbed like a drum she strained her
ears but gebhardt said nothing that
would arouse their suspicions it seemed
that they wanted to see the professors
apes and as gebhardt started to lead them
to the laboratory she joined them

  the laboratory was a one-story brick
building with heavily barred windows and
a stoutly bolted door at one side of the
single large room professor kincaid and
hartley sat working at a large desk and
in a caged off section at the rear two big
gorillas stared out at the visitors inquisi-
tively

  our guests told me of their distress-
ing experiences the professor said as
brides for the beast



soon as the deputy had announced their
mission had we a telephone i would
have notified you but it seems you have
discovered the bodies without my assist-
ance a most horrible tragedy gentle-
men but i can not see how you can sus-
pect that i am in any way responsible for
it these animals have not been out of
this building since i brought them here
where were they earlier tonight one
of the posseinen demanded

  right here in this room kincaid an-
swered readily my son and i have beei
working with them all evening they
were never out of our sight and even if
we had not been here to watch them you
can see that there is no possibility that
they could break out of their cage and
force their way out of this building i
have no idea what this murderous monster
may be but i can guarantee that it is not
one of my gorillas

  i know a monkey when i see one
the deputy insisted stubbornly and that
thing bess robley give birth to was a
monkey if one of these critters aint
its father-who was 

  minna had scrutinized the caged gor-
illas keenly there was no blood splashed
on their bodies and their paws were clean
no it couldnt have been these animals
she realized then the deputys question
caught her attention and she looked up-
to find august gebhardts eyes fixed on
her significantly

  what was the man insinuating that
hartley had been that foul monster back
in the clearingf that hartley was the
father of bess robleys monstrosity

  sickeningly the dying girls delirious
raving came back to her

  it wasnt a monkey critter it was
human

  what had she meant  could it be that a
human being-or something that appeared
to be a human being-had been the father
of that ape-like infant could it be that

there was appalling truth behind august
gebhardts nasty suggestions-that-dear
god that hartley was really-

  the lights in the room grew dimmer
seemed to contract into themselves-and
then hartleys arm was around her
shoulders supporting her as he led her to
the door

  brace up he said softly youve
had a trying day and your nerves are
about gone bed is the place for you

  alice was already asleep when minna
slipped quietly into bed beside her she
was tired herself exhausted and physical-
ly ill from worry but her jumpy nerves
would not let her sleep the room was
filled with hideous apes and grinning mon-
sters and whenever she dozed off they
seemed to gather around her to hang over
her to press down upon her-

  it was alices terrified scream that
snapped her out of it and brought her
back to full wakefulness

  the room was dark but a late moon
had risen and painted a dim patch of light
in the window frame against that light
she could see that something huge and
black was bending over her when she
tried to move a muscular hairy arm
pressed down upon her-and she looked
up into the snarling face of a gorilla

  minnas throat muscles were paralyzed
she could not utter a sound-and then
amazingly her own scream rang in her
ears rang for a second and then was
choked off as a hard black paw closed
over her mouth and stifled her

  frantically she struggled for breath
but there was no breaking that grip-no
chance to gulp even a single blessed draft
of air into her tortured lungs her heart
pounded madly the cords in her neck
strained and tightened into taut thongs
and the swelling veins at her temples
threatened to burst through the skin-and
then a wave of billowing darkness swept
up around her and engulfed her

bloody trail

tjfhen mina groped her vvay back to
consciousness she was still there in
her bed the room was dark the window
an unobstructed panel of dim radiance
just as it had been when she dozed off to
sleep there was no crouching ape no
snarling face bending over her perhaps
after all that horror had all been another
nightmare conjured up by her harried
brain

  her hand stretched out slowly to touch
alice-and flew back as if her exploring
fingers had come in contact with red-hot
metal

  the bed was empty

  minna pushed herself upright and
peered into the darkness now she could
see more clearly around the room it
was empty no trace of alice except her
clothes neatly arranged on a chair she
was gone-and minna knew that that hor-
rible ape had beer no fantastic creature
of her over-wrought imagination

  shakily minna climbed out of bed and
slipped into her negligee and slippers per-
haps alice had gone downstairs-but
there were her slippers beneath the bed
her negligee lying on the chair with her
clothes she was gone and perhaps even
now the monster might be returning to
drag minna off with him

  trembling she tiptoed to the door and
looked out into the hall it was dark and
empty fear spurred her on as she ran
through the darkness to hartleys room
and knocked on his door no answer
again she knocked louder surely he
must hear that but there was only silence
behind the panel

  noiselessly she opened the door and
looked inside the room was empty the
bed undisturbed

don porters room was next to that

  just a minute he answered sleepily

when she pounded on his door heck of
a time to wake a feller but ill be right
out

  but the moment he saw her frightened
face in the light of the lamp he had lit he
knew that this was no jesting matter

  alice-shes gone minna sobbed an
answer to his quick demand to know what
had happened that awful ape carried
her off

  don took charge efficiently after that
as soon as he had heard her story he be-
gan a search of the other rooms on the
sleeping floor professor kincaids was
empty the bed undisturbed but august
gebhardt was asleep he got dressed im-
mediately and joined them

  there was no sign of alice or anyone
else in the main building but there was a
light burning in the laboratory when
the searchers got there they found the pro-
fessor writing at his desk surrounded by
mounds of books

  alice gone he cried as soon as they
had told him what had happened but
how what could have taken her-and
how could it have gotten in and out of the
house i dont have to tell you that obo
and dora were here in their cage all night
just as you see them now but what sort
of frightful creature can this be

  the gorillas were asleep in their cage
and minna had no doubt that they had
been there all night just as he claimed-
and yet there was something furtive about
the professors manner when she caught
his eyes she was sure that she detected
guilty knowledge in them perhaps not
guilt so much as fear that was it-
fear he was terribly afraid of something
that he would not even mention

  but what if he knew that his steps
were innocent what had he to fear
minna tried to be obtuse tried to ignore
the answer that was clamoring for recog-
nition but it would not be denied

  kincaid was terrified because he thought
that hartley his son might be the guilty
brides for the benst



killer there she had admitted it to her-
self and with the admission came damn-
ing questions where was hartley now
how was it that his bed was undisturbed 
why wasnt he anywhere in the house or
here in the laboratory where could he
be at this time of night-if he was in-
nocent 

  before she could put one of those ques-
tions into words the answer came through
the laboratory door in the person of hart-
ley himself but the sight of him sent icy
fingers of horror clutching at minnas
heart his clothing was dirty and torn
there were scratches on his face and one
hand was covered with blood

  hello whats up  he grinned as
he dabbed at his bleeding palm with a
blood-soaked handkerchief

  where-were-you toneless and
dead the words forced themselves from
minnas lips

  looks as if id been in a war dont
i he laughed well dont be so
alarmed its nothing serious i climbed
up to the summit of the hill in back of
the house-the view from up there is
great in the moonlight-and i took a spill
on the way down almost broke my neck
but all i actually got out of it was a few
scratches

  minna watched his face and hope
sickened and died within her his story
didnt ring true she couldnt believe him
though she wanted to pin her faith to his
every word more than she had ever want-
ed anything in her life

  they searched the house for alice after
that but minna knew with hopeless cer-
tainty that it was a useless formality alice
would not be found in the building no
she would not be found until the monster
was finished with her and ready to discard
her poor mangled body

  at the rear of the building they routed
mandy goss out of her bed to join the
hunt despite her acrid comments about
letting a person get some sleep when there

was a lot of extra work heaped on her
corby got into his clothes too and trailed
around after them like a big lumbering
dog-or like a dumb calf as gebhardt
called him as he callously cuffed the pop-
eyed yokel out of his way

  the search was futile as minna knew
it would be and there was nothing left
but to give it up for the night sleep
seemed impossible for her any more that
night but when it did come it claimed her
completely when she opened her eyes it
was broad daylight

  alices clothes arranged with pathetic
neatess on the chair at the bedside stabbed
at her heart the moment she saw them and
the full horror of the night before flashed
back to her with it came a reminder of
the questions she had determined to put
to hartley

  the other doors on the upper hallway
were open as she stepped out of her room
evidently the others were already awake
and had gone downstairs but there was
a sound in hartleys room and she started
toward the open door

  it wasnt hartley but mandy straight-
ening up the room minna turned away
disappointedly-and then stopped and
looked back mandy was standing before
a closet door rattling it and tugging at
the knob while her ugly face was screwed
up into a scowl

  -have mighty important secrets to
keep from a body all of a sudden minna
heard her mutter as she gave the door a
final yank and then whirled away from it
disdainfully

  secrets in hartleys closet  according
to that it was not customary for him to
leave it locked then why-now 

  hardly knowing why she did so minna
slipped back into her own room and
waited there until mandy was finished
with her work and went down the hall to
the next room then when the way was
clear she walked quietly to hartleys door
and stepped inside


dime mystery magazine

  the closet door was still locked but
perhaps the key had dropped out onto the
floor it hadnt-but in the pocket of
hartleys bathrobe she found it

  the metal seemed to burn her fingers
as she lifted it out and she called her-
self a despicable sneak-but she must
know why that closet door was locked

  its the least i can do for alice she
told herself as she turned the key in the
lock

  what she expected to find behind that
locked door she had no idea-but what
she saw there sent her staggering back
across the room her mouth agape and
her eyes wide with horror

  wadded up in the corner of the closet
was a dark mass which she recognized in-
stantly a monkey skin complete with an
ugly snarling head a monkey skin that
was still matted with gummy blood-
alices blood

  o god o god she whispered over
and over as she stared at that awful hide
and as her numb mind tried to grasp what
its being there meant

  hartley the masquerader who had used
that skin to commit unthinkable crimes
hartley-part apes part man-slipping
back periodically into the animal kingdom
and using this jhorrible disguise to satisfy
his bestial appetites

  somehow she locked that door and put
the key back in his pocket in a daze not
knowing where to turn she went down-
stairs to breakfast the very thought of
food was abhorrent to her but gebhardt
was at the table and quickly recognized her
condition

  what you need is a strong cup of cof-
fee he prescribed that will help you
get yourself in hand and then when
she had drained the cup mandy brought
for her he leaned forward and asked
now-is there anything i can do for
you  anything you want to tell me-or
ask me 

  there were many things-not that she

wanted to ask but that she had to ask
him

  yes she said dully tell me-is
it possible that there could be such a crea-
ture-as you insinuated hartley might
be

  entirely possible his voice was
gentle and sympathetic if you will
come with me ill prove it to you

  unresisting she let him lead her into
the library seat her in an easy chair
then he took down two thick volumes
from the crowded shelves scientific
volumes from which he read passages
aloud to her those volumes spoke of
hellish things-of savage women who had
mated with apes-of the hybrid offspring
that had resulted some of those misfit
creatures had lived for years and one of
the volumes stated that it was possible
that others that had been lost in the jun-
gle turned completely beast

  so you see it is entirely possible geb-
hardt finished his reading there is no
reason either why a strong superior type
of human female mated with an ape
should not produce an offspring in which
the ape characteristics of the father would
be entirely lost-outwardly anyway but
of course there is no telling when such a
creature would revert to type and become
for a period of time all ape and there
is no guarantee that a woman marrying
such a creature would not give birth to
full-fledged apes-throwbacks to the pa-
ternal grandparent

  minnas face was white blank but her
tortured mind was writhing in agony
that was what the dying girl in the shack
had meant the father of her child had
not been a monkey to her eyes he had
looked like a human being but the result
of their union was the terrible monstrosity
minna had seen bom

  and the father of that child was-
from a drawer of his desk gebhardt
had drawn a faded diary which he held
out before her
brides for the beast



  do you recognize this handwriting
he asked it is professor kincaids the
items you will notice begin in  the
year hartley was born

  and then he began to read-an account
that seared into minnas brain as if the
letters of each word were printed there
with vitriol that account recorded the
birth of a male child whose mother was a
white woman-her mate a gorilla for
three years that shocking chronicle fol-
lowed the infants development day by
day-until minna raised her trembling
hands as if to shut the thing from her mind

  i do not know definitely that this is a
record of hartleys birth and infancy
gebhardt concluded but certainly you
should know more about him before you
marry him if i were you-

  that was where hartley interrupted
them as he entered the study his face
was grave and worried as he turned to
minna

  what could have happened to alice is
a complete mystery he told her we
have searched the grounds and the entire
neighborhood and there isnt the slightest
trace of her anywhere it seems queer to
give up the search-but there isnt any-
thing more we can do nothing but wait
until we see what happens dad is anxious
to complete the experiment hes working
on so i suppose i might as well get it
over with

  i want to talk to you a few minutes
before you go hartley minna sum-
moned up courage to say and she was
thankful that gebhardt tactfully left the
room it seems odd here in your home
that there is no picture or reminder of
your mother you have never told me
anything about her hartley

  he frowned and she saw that he was
uncomfortable

  as a matter of fact he admitted i
know very little about her my mother is
a subject on which dad has never been
willing to speak so far as i have been

able to gather she was a very beautiful
woman and she died when i was very
young dad was heartbroken and became
pretty much a recluse he moved out
here in the wilderness to lose himself in
his work and forget the pain in his heart

  i believe there was a woman who took
care of me for a while but that evidently
didnt work out for my earliest recollec-
tions are of being raised in a private
school i must have been three or four
then after my early schooling was over
i came here to live with father-and the
apes ive been with them so much since
then that i know them a lot better than
ive ever known any woman but you 

  at the age of three was when that dairy
of the ape-child ended minna shivered
inwardly and tried not to let him see the
horror that gripped her until the palms
of her hands were wet with perspiration
she picked up a cigarette from the desk
and held it to her lips expectantly but
hartley seemed not to notice

  the lady wants a light she laughed
wheres your lighter

  again he was uncomfortable she no-
ticed that he stalled and stammered em-
barrassedly

  i seem to have mislaid it he confessed
at last had it a day or so ago but it
isnt here now im pretty sure i know
where i left it

  minna wanted to give it to him to tell
him that she knew well enough where he
had left it wanted to tell him that she
knew all about that bloody disguise locked
away upstairs in his closet-but she
couldnt she had to get out of that room
out of the house out into the air where it
was clean and fresh

  unconsciously her footsteps led to the
rear of the building past the laboratory
and on up the hill behind it not until she
was halfway up the slope did she admit
to herself why she was there she was

going up to the top to the spot where
hartley claimed he had been when alice
disappeared last night

  she wanted to see for herself if there
was any sign of his having fallen if he
really had been up there on the summit-
if there was a scar on the earth where he
slipped and fell-then there might still be
an explanation for the damning circum-
stances that were closing in tighter and
tighter around him

  the slim hope beckoned to her lured
her on until she was panting from her
eager exertions the summit was just
ahead there-an open space beneath a
lordly pine-a few yards more

  and then her legs became leaden
weights that clung to the ground as if
molded there while her bulging eyes
stared up at that pine-at the bare stretch
of ground beneath it there was some-
thing white there-something ghastly
white and smeared with brownish red
that sprawled in the sunshine at the foot
of the tree

  she knew what that white thing was

  it took an age to climb those last few
yards and with every relentless step the
sight that met her eyes became more ter-
rifying alice stretched out there on the
ground stark and cold her naked body
stained and smeared with her own blood
her face had been mercilessly beaten until
it was hardly recognizable her throat
ripped to shreds by savage claws

  and there beside her lay the tattered
remnants of the lacy nightgown the beast
had torn from her body in his feverish
lust

  tears would not come as minna stood
looking down at that appalling sight it
seemed they were dried up within her-
lost in the crumbling wreckage of her
hopes her plans her whole world as it
came tumbling down in chaos around her

chapter five

foul clutches

as minna staggered blindly down
that hill she wanted more than any-
thing else to get away as far away as
possible from that awful place and all
it contained the place was evil wicked
damned by the unholy experiments pro-
fessor kincaid had performed there in the
profaned name of science it terrified her
made her feel as if she were in a trap
that was slowly but surely closing in
around her

  perhaps she would be the next victim
to feel those savage paws tearing at her
to die abominably in the clutch of those
hairy arms-and to lie naked and muti-
lated in the light of the rising sun

  panic routed her caution sent her down
the hill in headlong mad flight until she
was no longer able to stop herself straight
ahead of her was the laboratory kincaids
infernal workshop she tried to steer
away from it but couldnt careening and
half falling she rushed toward it just as
a figure stepped away from the side of the
building and directly in her path

  it was august gebhardt lie set him-
self and caught her pulled her to her feet
as she would have pitched to the ground

  i found alice she gasped when she
regained her breath up there on the
hill-dead oh god-it was horrible
let me get away from here-please
another gebhardt clipped grimly
and his lips compressed into a hard white
line now maybe you will believe me i
have been looking for you-to show you
something that will open your eyes
no no minna protested as she
tried to tear away from him but his fing-
ers were tightly closed around her wrist

  it will take only a few minutes he
insisted and then you can go-knowing
what it is you are running away from
quiet now 
brides for the beast



  firmly he led her to the side of the
laboratory building to where a clump of
bushes grew close to one of the windows
from the shelter of the bushes they could
see into the room and the window had
been propped up a few inches so that they
could hear

  minna stopped trying to break away
when she caught a glimpse of what was
going on inside hartley was sitting in an
easy chair in the middle of the big room
and the gorillas obo and dora out of
their cage were hovering around him pat-
ting him peering into his face and moving
their lips as if they were trying to talk to
him

  fine-excellent came from the other
side of the laboratory where professor
kincaid was sitting at his desk watching
intently and jotting down notes on the
paper before him try that again hart-
ley

   hartley laughed and leaned back in his
chair

  a b c tumble-down he sang to
them very slowly and deliberately cats
in the cupboard and cant see me now
then a-b-c-

  the gorillas watched every movement
of his lips and now their mouths were
open and sounds were coming from them
not the actual letters and words that he
had spoken but sounds at least resembling
them it was eery listening to those
huge apes on the verge of speech-and
the garbled version of the simple nursery
rhyme sent cold chills down minnas spine

  good girl dora hartley congratu-
lated one of the beasts and then made
queer animal sounds that brought what
was unmistakably a gratified smile to the
creatures ugly face

  dora slipped her long arm around him
and petted him while she leaned over his
chair and tried to repeat the jingle for
him

  excellent kincaid exulted again
 there never has been anyone with such

influence over gorillas you are able to
bring them closer to the borderline be-
tween animal and human than has ever
been accomplished

  yes hartley grinned and when i
spend a couple hours with them like this
i feel as if i am pretty close to the border-
line myself youll make a confounded
ape of me-have me loping around on all
fours-if you dont finish up this experi-
ment mighty soon

  minna could stand no more hysterical
screams were crowding up into her throat
ready to burst forth at any moment sud-
denly she twisted her wrist free from geb-
hardts grip and darted out of the bushes
ran frantically toward the residence she
must find don porter he would take her
away before her straining nerves snapped
entirely

  don was in front of the house pacing
the ground nervously and watching the
sur-rounding hills as if he expected to see
alice appear on the edge of the woods at
any moment he looked up with startled
concern when he caught sight of minnas
wild eyes and terrified face then she was
in his arms sobbing out her story

  i found alice she gasped we cant
do anything more for her don shes
dead and well all be with her if we dont
get away from this place please don let
me get in the car now and drive away-
as far away as we can get please don
porter was puzzled but he saw the un-
mistakable signs of hysteria

  all right well go he soothed her
but how about hartley

  he was even more amazed by the min-
gled dread and agony that flamed in her
wide eyes

  hes-hes part of it don she whis-
pered i cant tell you any more now
please get me away

  doubtfully he led the way around the
side of the house to the garage the mo-
ment he swung back the rolling door he
knew that something was wrong the

air was heavy with gasoline fumes one
glance beneath his car told him the an-
swer nail holes had been punched into
the bottom of the gasoline tank and every
drop of fuel had run out onto the floor
hartleys car the only other in the gar-
age was in the same condition drained
and useless

  minna saw those pools on the floor and
understood what they m ant before he
could say a word she should have known
it would not be so easy to escape the trap
was too carefully prepared and it was
closing in on her relentlessly

  fearfully she glanced out of the gar-
age toward the house half expecting to
see a huge hairy monster bearing down
on her instead she looked straight into
the cold malignant eyes of mandy goss
fixed on them with hostile intensity and
the effect was as chilling as if the beast
itself had been watching them

  well that means we dont leave-un-
less we walk don said grimly as he
started away from the useless car and
before we start doing that im going up
that hill for alices body 

  minna dreaded another sight of that
pitiful corpse but she did not dare to
remain at the house alone hartley geb-
hardt and professor or the prowling mon-
ster-any of them might find her there
and one terrified her as much as an-
other going back up the hill she would
at least have don to protect her

  as they climbed she tried haltingly to
explain the horrible fear that hung over
her-to explain what gebhardt had in-
sinuated and what she had seen with her
own eyes but she could see that don
looked at her queerly sympathetically
that he considered her half out of her
mind from fright

  she could not blame him for that it
did sound insane-a perfectly normal man
becoming a monkey but with her own
lips she had heard hartley say that often
he felt close to the borderline that sepa-

rates mankind from the animal kingdom
that was when he was conscious of what
he was doing but what about those times
when he actually slipped over the line and
became a beast  then he would not know
what he was doing-would be no more
responsible for his horrible deeds than
the ape that had been his father

  they were halfway to the top of the
hill when minna froze in her tracks
and turned a blanched face to don there
it was again-hartleys voice farther
down the slope calling her name

  for a moment it paralyzed her rang in
her ears like the knell of doom then
she grabbed dons arm and urged him up
the brushy trail with greater speed

  please dont answer don she
begged as she cast frightened glances be-
hind her

  minna there it was again nearer
now he was coming after her catching
up with her

  minna scrambled through the brush as
long as she dared until his voice seemed
almost at their heels then she dragged
don down beside her into the shelter of
a thick clump of bushes

  she could hear his footsteps now hear
him snapping twigs scuffing stones out of
his way nearer and nearer were his
senses more acute than theirs she won-
dered would animal instinct lead him
straight to their hiding place

  her heart pounded so loudly that she
was sure he would hear it desperately
she poised for a mad flight if he broke
in upon them nearer-nearer now he
must be only a few yards away and
then she knew that he had passed his
voice came back to her from above them
and the noise of his progress became
fainter

  not until it had died out altogether
would she let don start up again cau-
tiously watching on all sides of them
they climbed steadily without catching
sight of him-and then they came to the
brides for the beast



bare stretch from which they could get
a clear view of the hilltop

  there at the foot of the pine alices
nude body lay as minna had left it but
now a man was bending over it

  thats gebhardt don identified him
immediately whats he doing-

  before he could finish his question his
eyes popped wide and he stared open-
mouthed up the slope from the lowest
limb of the pine a huge black body swung
down and then dropped-to land on all
fours on gebhardts back

  the german went down flat on the
ground the wind knocked out of him
and the black furry was all over him
pounding and tearing at him with claw-
ing paws before he could stagger to
his feet the great arms closed around
him and held him helpless dragged him
to his feet seized him by the throat and
shook him like a limp doll

  the thing took only seconds before
minna had stifled her first gasp of sur-
prise gebhardt screamed horribly-and
the blood spurted from his torn throat
while the huge ape snarled and voiced
its triumph in weird animal noises

  even after his head fell back limply the
ape tore and ripped at him shredding his
throat mangling his face beating and
pounding at him with savage fury that
exhibition of bestial rage was appalling
-nauseating minna felt weak and sick

  and then she saw that don was racing
up the hill crazily intent on trying to
save the professors assistant

  with a shout he launched himself at the
gorilla-but the huge monster dropped the
crimson horror that had been gebhardt
and lunged straight at his new opponent
the black fist swung up from the ground
and smashed into dons face with sick-
ening force somehow he managed to
stand up under that blow but he was
tottering - staggering backward - his
arms dropping helplessly at his sides and
the monster was lunging at him again

  minna screamed shrilly wildly and for
a fraction of a second the ape hesitated
peered down the slope to where she
crouched then one hairy arm swung
around in a black arc and caught don a
backhand blow on the side of the head
that lifted him off his feet and sent him
crashing into a clump of scrub oak

  even before his body hit the ground
the ape was loping down the slope straight
at minna

  with a terrified shriek she whirled on
legs that threatened to collapse beneath
her at any moment it was no use she
knew that she could never outrun the
creature it was coming toward her with
great ground-covering strides and then
-great god in heaven-it called her
name

  not distinctly not clearly-but plainly
enought so that she could not mistake it
minna the way those gorillas down in
the laboratory might have pronounced it
after hartley

  was this thing one of the professors
gorillas but they could not have recog-
nized her would not have known her
name even if they could have spoken
it then-then it must be hartley-
slipped across the line and become a sav-
age beast-but still able to recognize her
and call to her with the half-human ut-
terance of the gorilla that he had be-
come 

  minnas brain reeled under that fear-
ful realization and the delicate balance
that separates rationality from insanity
was upset tumbled helter-skelter she
was no longer sane as she ran down that
hill with strength that had never been
hers before there was room for only
one thought in her mind she must run-
run--run

  behind her she could hear the ape
pounding along after her and new energy
enabled her to put on a fresh burst of
speed had she been sane she would have
fallen a dozen times in that mad flight

she would have turned an ankle would
have crashed into a tree would have
slipped and cracked her head open on a
stone but now her subconsciousness pro-
tected her like a guardian angel she must
run-run-run somehow she must keep
ahead of that frightful creature crashing
along in her rear

  now she was on the path leading di-
rectly to the buildings below ahead of
her was the laboratory-and bedlam was
raging in there from the open door came
a hoarse scream-a groan of agony but
she hardly heard-and there was no time
to turn away the creature was almost
upon her

  without a glance at the laboratory she
ran past reached the main building
dashed inside and flung the door shut be-
hind her the key had hardly turned in
the lock before a heavy body thudded
against the panels with such force that the
door trembled

  run-run-run minna sped up the
stairs-just as a downstairs window
crashed now where to her room-it
was the only haven she knew she could
hear the creature starting up the stairs as
she slammed the door behind her and
locked it

  but that door would never hold against
the apes tremendous strength there was
only one hiding place in the room-the
closet and there wasnt a second to lose
the monster was pounding at the door
minna pulled the key out of the closet
door lock slipped inside and locked it after
her perhaps if she was very quiet-if
she could muffle the sobbing gasps of her
panting breath-

  the outer door fell in with a crash-
and the monster was at the closet tugging
at the door a chair splintered against it
smashed a hole through one of the light
panels a hairy black paw came through
the aperture grabbed the frame of the
door and pulled the wood creaked splin-

tered-and the door tumbled out in wreck-
age

  in the doorway loomed the hideous ape
blood splashed over its torso dripping
from its crimsoned arms minna tried not
to look at it tried to cover her face with
her hands as she cowered back against the
wall but the monster grabbed her wrist
and dragged her out into the room held
her tight against its bloodstained breast

  close up against the creature she could
see now that it was not actually an ape
but a man masquerading in a gorillas
skin the eyes that glared at her out of
the snarling mask of a face were blue eyes
-blue eyes like hartleys

  desperately minna thrust her hands
against the ugly mask and tried to push it
away from her beat at it with her fists
tore at it

  let me go let me go she shrieked
as she tried to wriggle out of the hairy
arms that encircled her

  one arm released her she was almost
free-and then the black fist crashed down
on her head like a club a great ball of
fire seemed to burst in her brain and in
its dazzling glare the world slipped out
from under her

chapter six

hate feeds

hhhat light was still blazing above her
when her brain began to function
again it hurt her eyes made them blink
as she looked up into it-and then she
discovered that she was staring up into
a lighted lamp that hung from the roof
of a cave she was lying on the floor a
hard stone floor and her aching wrists
and ankles were tied so securely that she
could not even move them

  there seemed to be some crude home-
made furniture in the place-benches and
a table then she saw that she was not
alone sitting tied to a bench on the other
brides for the beast



side of the cave was professor kincaid
looking ghastly pale and obviously in great
mental anguish and the blood-spattered
ape was standing beside him

  minna groaned with the combined pain
of her throbbing head and her burning
wrists and ankles the murderous crea-
ture caught the sound and wheeled to face
her-and her eyes stared past him unbe-
lievingly then her heart leaped with wild
relief and delirious exultation

  the fiend beneath that gorilla-skin dis-
guise was not hartley- for hartley was
sitting there on the bench beside his father
tied up and helpless  there was a smear
of blood on his forehead and his eyes were
haggard as they met her gaze but that
did not matter he was not the atrocious
killer he was not a bloodthirsty beast-
a half-ape in human form

  but there was an ape there in the cave
not this disguised fiend but a real simian
she heard it snarl in rage heard it pacing
up and down fretfully and then as her
eyes became more accustomed to the semi-
darkness of the place she saw that one
end of the cave was barred off into a cage
behind those bars a real gorilla a mon-
ster even larger than the professors apes
was swaying back and forth while its red
eyes fairly glowed with fury

  jest take it easy pet mandy gosss
harsh cracked voice erooned to the beast
your times a-comin right soon now

  with a throaty chuckle she turned from
the cage and came grinning into the
light her shrewish face was diabolical in
its gloating hatred as she strode from one
to the other of her captives and glared
down at them then she stopped in front
of the professor and spat full in his
face while her evil features were suf-
fused with unholy triumph

  what-what is the meaning of this
mandy kincaid gasped aas he stared
up into her frenzied face

  so you dont know me eh the hag
grinned malevolently after all these

years im still jest mandy goss to you
youre a right smart man when it comes
to monkey critters professor but you
dont know much about humans you
were so busy fussin around with your
beasts that you didnt have time to recog-
nize the mother of nonnie blake yes
nonnie blake the gal you hired to take
care of that brat of yours when you came
out to these parts the gal you killed with
your dirty experiments her rage was
mounting until now she was leaning over
the professor and howling into his set
face the gal you mated with a monkey
and then threw out of your house when she
was goin to have a baby

  silence heavy and pregnant with
ghastly tragedy hung over the cave after
she had flung her horrible charge minna
stared at the professor while little trickles
of horror wriggled through her could
it be possible that he had done such a
foul inhuman thing was that the guilty
knowledge she had thought she detected in
his eyes

  his lips were working she saw but it
was long moments before he managed to
speak

  mandy his low voice came at last
if i had only known that was what you
thought- the thing is preposterous no
beast was ever near nonnie i never al-
lowed her in the laboratory-but i did
come upon her in an illicit affair with a
wandering gypsy when i discovered that
she was pregnant i told her she would
have to go if she told you anything else
she lied to protect herself

  all right enough to call a deal gal a
liar mandy brushed aside his explana-
tion scornfully she cant answer for her-
self but i can-and her son can for
years ive been slavin for you hatin the
grdund you walked on hopin that every
mouthful of vittles i cooked for you would
choke you-but ive been waitin an plan-
nin all the while and now my dear pro-


dime mystery magazine

fessor my time-my time an nonnies
time-has come at last

  the infuriated womans voice had risen
until it was a harsh shriek punctuated
with the stamping of her feet and the wav-
ing of her gnarled hands she had nursed
her bitter hatred so long that her mind
was deranged and now that she was about
to taste her revenge she could hardly con-
tain herself

  now youll pay she howled gleefully
pay the way i paid my only regret is
that you havent a daughter of your own
who can be treated the way my nonnie
was but well make out the best we can
this gal who was goin to be your daugh-
ter-in-law will do as well i expect-an
after tanas finished with her hell take
care of you and your son

  tana the professor squinted his
weak eyes toward the cage and then
nodded his head so thats what became
of tana you had him here ive been
worried about him ever since he escaped
from the laboratory years ago

  ever since i turned him loose an led
him here you mean mandy gloated
gettin tana was jest the first step in my
plan to settle the account with you dig-
gin up tanas mate after she died on
you an skinnin her was the second
every time i heard of ore of those
grisly killings i was sure it was tanas
doing the professor went on as if he had
not heard her but i did not dare to men-
tion my suspicion for fear the enraged na-
tives would kill off my other animals and
drive me out of the hills i lived in con-
stant dread of what the creature might
do

  youll see what he does soon enough
mandy chuckled as she started back
toward the cage corby get that gal
ready for tana

  so the fiend in that bloody gorilla-skin
disguise was corby the old womans vac-
uous-faced grandson that was what
poor bess robely had meant in her delir-

ious raving the father of her child wore
an apes skin but was a human being and
the infant had been no monkey but one of
natures horrible blunders a mongolian
idiot

  minna tried frantically to wriggle away
from the repulsive fiend but he reached
over and picked her up as if she had been
a doll then he dragged her to the center
of the cave and slashed the ropes around
her wrists and ankles with a bloodstained
knife before she could move her numb
hands he grabbed her right wrist and
snapped a handcuff around it from the
cuff a short length of heavy chain led to
an iron ring that was bolted into the rock
floor

  hopelessly minna tried to struggle with
him to fight him off but he knocked her
off her feet with one slap of his black fist
and then held her down while he tore the
clothing from her body-while his lusting
eyes gloated over her nakedness until
mandy ordered him out of the way

  minna cowered on the floor and
watched the cage with fascinated eyes the
gorilla was working himself into a fever-
ish rage tearing up and down the barred
enclosure but never taking his eyes off
her sniveling animal noises came from
his throat and his red eyes flamed with de-
sire once he got out of that cage-

  horror had numbed her brain had
frozen her body so that her flesh felt like
ice there was nothing she could do-
nothing anyone could do hartley and the
professor were shouting threats pleas
were calling wildly for help but mandy
only laughed and jeered at them

  go on and holler she taunted even
if anybody heard you they would not come
near the place ive worked on them-
built up their fear and hate-so that they
wouldnt move a finger to drag you back
from the edge of hell

  there was nothing anyone could do but
hartley yelled all the louder as if to scare
the gorilla by the volume of noise
brides for the beast



  but that would not work mandy had
unlocked the door and the creature rushed
toward it minna wanted to close her eyes
to hide from the sight of him rushing
toward her already she could feel her-
self in his arms-could feel his black
paws tearing at her soft flesh but her
eyes would not close she had to watch-
had to stare unblinkingly as the monster
lunged out of the cage

  there she is tana mandy goss
laughed go an take your bride-jest
the way you had nonnie

  deliberately the gorilla loped forward
on all fours then he was right above her
crouching on his haunches looking down
at her with flaming eyes one black paw
reached out and touched her naked side
tentatively

  minna wanted to scream to shriek-but
not a sound would come from her parched
throat she wanted to shrink away to tear
her hand out of the manacle that held her
-but not a muscle would move she lay
there like an ivory statue while the black
fingers ran exploringly over her flinching
body

  this was the preliminary torture of
purgatory but it would be very short she
told herself with a strange detached calm-
ness then would come fiery hell itself-
and after that the sweet relief of death
it would all be over in a few minutes
just a few minutes of excruciating quiv-
ering agony and then-

  was she mad entirely was her de-
lirious brain conjuring up phantoms to add
to her torment peopling the cave with gor-
illas  there in the entrance was another
one-and behind it still another

  but they were not creatures of her im-
agination hartley saw them too fora
moment he stopped tugging and tearing at
the ropes that bound him to the bench
and gaped at the cave entrance then new
hope dawned in his sweat-streaked face
he recognized them

  dora obo he called out to them

come dora come obo come here

  the gorillas seemed uncertain hesi-
tated not knowing just what to do-and
hartley talked to them in the way they
had come to understand a weird medley
of sounds-clicks whines grunts and
huffs-came from his lips and the apes
understood

  with an angry roar they loped into the
cave tana was quick to sense their chal-
lenge he turned from minnas alluring
white body and leaped to meet them

  in the next moment three hairy bodies
were locked in a tumbling ball of savage
fury long arms flailed and pounded pre-
hensile feet ripped and tore and gleaming
teeth bit and slashed the cave was filled
with the fury of their struggle and min-
na expected that at any moment they
would roll on top of her and grind the life
out of her beneath their straining bodies

  but theirs was not the only primeval
passion unleashed in that cave when
mandy goss saw her long-cherished re-
venge slipping from her grasp she became
a shrieking fury with bony fingers
curled into talons she threw herself at the
professor and raked his defenseless face

  minna stared in horror but at that mo-
ment hartley tore his wrists free and
drove his fist into the hags face before
she could return to the attack he had un-
tied his feet and sprang up from the bench
with one arm he knocked mandy out of
the way-sent her sprawling dazed into
the middle of the cave-and then he closed
with corby the fake gorilla who came
rushing at him

  back and forth the length of the cave
they battered and pounded at each other
but corbys strength was prodigious
minna watched fearfully saw unmistak-
ably that hartley was weakening then
corby got his long hair-covered arms
around his opponents waist and lifted
him bodily off the floor

for a moment they traded blows corby
using only one arm while the other pressed


dime mystery magazine

tighter and tighter around hartley
squeezing the breath out of him then
they pitched to the floor and hartley was
underneath desperately he tried to keep
up the fight but he was weakening-weak-
ening-

  out of the corner of her eye minna saw
mandy goss get to her knees she was
creeping-making her way toward where
corby had dropped the knife with which
he had cut minnas bonds once the old
woman got her hands on that knife she
would plunge it into hartleys breast

  but before she could reach it she had to
pass within minnas reach

  every nerve taut the girl waited until
exactly the right second then she threw
herself the full length of the chain-and
her arms tightened around mandys legs
dragged her back into the center of the
cave and closed in a death grip around the
the hags arms mandy raved and cursed
but those white arms held her helpless
with the strength of utter desperation

  minna hardly dared to take her eyes
from her captive but when she did flash a
glance at hartley sickening fear enveloped
her his arms were futilely trying to ward
off corbys clutching fingers-but the ape
talons were already wet with blood and
they darted back again and again to his
torn throat

  dora hartley gasped through
puffed battered lips come dora

  and the almost human gorilla heard his
cry heard and left it to her mate to finish
the half-dead tana noiselessly she glided
across the cave and loomed up over the
struggling men one black paw reached
down and grabbed corbys shoulder to
yank him backward the other closed
around his throat and corby died the way
he had killed his helpless victims a yell
of terror strangling in the blood-clogged

throat that was being torn from his body

  the moment hartley was free he
sprang to mandy goss and took her out of
minnas arms he was just finishing ty-
ing her with the ropes that had been
around his own arms and legs when don
porter crawled into the cave entrance

  good work he congratulated and
managed a painful grin just about in
time too that posse is down at the house
again theyre coming this way now and
they mean business this time

  don minna cried where did you
come from i thought that monster-
corby-killed you when he murdered geb-
hardt

  thats what he thought too don
nodded he left me lying up there in the
bushes while he chased you but im a
pretty tough bird to kill i couldnt make
much speed in the condition i was in but
i managed to crawl down the hill when
i heard hartley and the professor yelling
for help i figured they were in a pretty bad
way for reenforcements i wasnt worth a
damn myself but i knew hartley has a
pretty good drag with those gorillas so i
crawled into the laboratory and turned
them loose they followed the sound of
his voice-and you know the rest of it

  good man hartley clipped we
wont forget it don then he turned to
where minna huddled blushing still
chained to the floor and now before
those hill-billies come swarming in here to
start mandy on her way to the electric
chair weve got to get some clothes on
you darling

  but even before he attended to that he
gathered her in his eager arms and covered
her trembling lips with a fervid kiss-a
kiss which she returned joyously and
thankfully without even a trace of a ter-
rifying reservation

 bedfellow
 from hell

by larry aaoorc

in the dead of night leona awak-
ened in that old dark house-to find
that her bed had been invaded by
a being whose grisly passions were
not of this earth

as leona looked up into the yellow-
flecked agate eyes of talbot
rhone she seemed to feel the
clutch of icy fingers on her heart you
wont marry me then he said in an odd
tight tone you insist upon going to
live in that weird old house

  ive always told you that i couldnt
marry you talbot and i most certainly
am going to live in the comfortable home
i have inherited she asserted firmly pur-
pose unshaken though the chill was
spreading from her heart throughout her
body as a physician you have assured
me that i am in a state of exhaustion
that i should have complete physical and
mental relaxation-in the country what
better place could there be than this fine
old house of great-aunt judiths in
greyport 

  leona he bent his head holding her
eyes by his intense gaze as a physician
i tell you that is the last place you should
go-to a house so old it is saturated with
dead mouldering things its very timbers
creak and groan from the stress of past
griefs that fill the ancient rooms to burst-
ing youth should have new things sun-
shine color-not decay the shadows and
miasma that arise from graves give up
this idea-let me take you away




dime mystery magazine

  his hand was on her arm the fingers
hot yet their touch sent a freezing cur-
rent through her veins

  no she tried to free herself i
shall not change my mind and ill love
that old home-mellowed by time where
people have joyed as well as sorrowed

  dead-people he whispered

  then his clasp tightened bit into the
soft flesh of her arm the yellow flecks in
his eyes spread to a blaze that leaped at
her

  its tom farrell whos come between
us he burst out hotly and i say that
youll never marry him    something
will prevent

  i shall marry tom as soon as he
comes back from this engineering proj-
ect she said steadily leona had meant
to keep this fact to herself sensing tal-
bot rhones unreasoning and unjustifiable
jealousy but his words stung her to
speech

  he searched her face for a moment
then his expression changed and he re-
leased her

  im sorry-forgive me he implored
my love for you-sets me crazy-at
thought of another man    but more
than all i want to protect you it worried
me to think of you going to live in that
house of- he broke off with a slight
shudder well forget all i said and
when i come to greyport-you know i
often run down to see the old folks-ill
look you up and see that youre all right
after all were sort of cousins since one
of mine married one of yours and i
used to play in your aunt judiths house
-maybe it isnt as bad as i remember it
but the thought of it certainly did give me
goose-flesh on a hot summer day his
laugh was almost convincing

t eona as glad to leave him and

walked briskly though her dislike
had been growing through the two years

he had been importuning her to marry
him never till that day had his manner
stirred fear she tried to banish this re-
minding herself that talbot exerted him-
self to do much that was good giving
considerable time to charity patients and
to work in the county hospital   

  a week later she was in greyport taking
formal possession of her new home she
had immediate evidence of talbot rhones
concern for her when the attorney in
charge of the property said 

  i wrote you the former housekeeper
was getting too old for the place and i
was having difficulty getting anyone suit-
able wouldnt have one yet either if dr
rhone hadnt happened down to see his
folks a few days ago he learned of it
and recommended a capable woman-
patient of his-who was glad to get the
position the doc says you arent well
-need to be favored quite a bit

  i only need rest ruth said aware
that a little wave of gratitude went out to
talbot

  it was a sunless day with wisps of fog
trailing sadly through the air and she
had rather dreaded the possibility of ar-
riving at a lonely house the presence of
another woman would be cheering

  she was more glad of this assurance
when they neared the edge of the village
and came into view of the old purdy
house among its terraces and somber
crowding evergreens smoke came from
the two chimneys to droop in sable plumes
to the ground the box hedge gave off a
faint not pleasant odor into the clammy
air the place was permeated with gloom

  involuntarily leona shivered her glance
going from sodden terraces and funereal
trees to the mist-saturated and time-stained
brick walls of the dwelling

  decay-old things-dead things she
thought with another shiver oh i do
wish talbot hadnt said that

  bravely she threw off the mood enter-
bedfellow from hell



ing the dwelling to greet the housekeeper
with friendly warmth this was returned
by the stout woman who at once displayed
signs of wishing to mother the girl
but despite mrs grahams cheerfulness
the warmth of generous fires the interior
of the house repeated the effect of the
outside the walls were covered with
paper of not one but several generations
past the hangings while clean were
drab with the faded colors of half a cen-
tury and the graveyard smell of the
damp hedge appeared to have seeped
through the small-paned windows

  that day brought no sun as the hours
passed the fog wisps thickened drew to-
gether to form trailing streamers that at
times hung motionless at others swirled
weirdly about

  it does look like a winding sheet
mrs graham commented makes you
think of the poor soul thats just gone
from here

  oh dont leona exclaimed

  do excuse me miss wade the older
woman begged contritely i forgot dr
rhone said you wasnt to be disturbed
nor made nervous about anything and
you mustnt get to-imagining things-its
dangerous when a bodys near a nervous
breakdown these words seemed to
hang heavily in the air as mrs graham
turned away

  leona moved restlessly through the
many rooms all bleak in appearance
family portraits on the walls of each and
the female purdy ancestors all seemed
to have affected one style of hairdressing
parted in the center and brought low over
the ears the effect of so many similar
ones suggested a collection of family
ghosts hanging on the walls the girl
tried not to look at them

  learning that the housekeepers room
was on the lower floor of the east wing
leona chose one above to be near the
only other occupant of the house miss

judith purdy had occupied a room off the
main hall at right angles to the one taken
by leona

rphe coming of night and closing in of
the fog to an unbroken clammy cur-
tain shut out the world this isolation
added to the gloom of the house and the
girl found herself continually forcing her
thoughts from the words talbot rhone
had used to describe the place shortly
after ten oclock she went upstairs

  the blazing fire on her hearth and her
own things scattered about had a pleas-
ant effect and for a few moments her
mood lightened then she raised a shade
preparatory to opening a window for the
night she halted outstretched hand on
the sash eyes staring through the glass
and across the open space to a window
in the main building from which shone a
bluish-white light

  a woman sat there-a woman with
black hair parted in the middle and
brought down over her ears and she
wore a dress like one leona had seen in
great-aunt judiths closet that day this
figure was knitting and rocking steadily
back and forth

  the fog drifted between but that blu-
ish light filtered through uncannily

  a scream rose to leonas lips oh
mrs graham come-come

  there was the sound of running feet
an encouraging call and a moment later
the housekeeper came panting up the
stairs

  look-look the girl gasped point-
ing at the window

  the woman came close to her side
gazing at that other window she shook
her head giving the girl a puzzled look
what is it

  oh god-cant you see her leona
gasped

  dearie-there isnt anything to see
but fog and the dark wall of the house

  the girl stared through wild dilated
eyes its aunt judith she cried chok-
ingly

  mrs graham shook her head anxiously
see here my dear she murmured put-
ting an arm about the shaking figure
im going to draw that curtam to shut
out that awful fog-it makes you imagine
things-

  imagine-things leona exclaimed
tensely

  the other woman continued as if she
didnt notice the interruption and im
going to get you some hot milk which
you must drink and ill sit with you till
you go to sleep

  she tucked the girl into the bed turned
on all the lights and hurried to the kit-
chen she was back in a surprisingly
short space of time leona drank the
steaming liquid without question after-
wards she directed firmly

  raise that shade-just a second-i
must see

  but there was no blue tight shining
from the other window-only fog swirls
harboring in the corner between the wing
and the main building

  holding tight to mrs grahams plump
hand leona fell asleep and it was
broad day when she wakened

compelled to decide that she act-
 ually had imagined the figure in her
great-aunt judiths window leona
forced her thoughts from re-creating that
picture in memory and the morning
brought word that tom farrell would be
in greyport within the next three days

  everythingll be all right then she
assured mrs graham with a radiant smile
on her red lips

  by night the girl found courage to go
alone to her room i mustnt let this
nonsense got hold of me she assured
herself valiantly succeeding in allaying
fear for the moment

  but terror far exceeding that of the
former night seized leona when she
looked from her window there was the
same womans figure this time with head
lifted to stare straight across the space
at her the features were livid the eyes
burning with unearthly fire

  with a wild cry leona ran from her
room and through the hall to the head of
the staircase there she came to an ab-
rupt halt crouching against the balus-
trade the screams silenced in her throat
at the foot of the stairs stood another
woman with dark hair parted smoothly
in the center winglike folds over each
ear but this one was thinner than aunt
judith the same bluish-white light re-
vealed her clearly she tilted her head to
look up and leona saw with horror-
drenched senses that the face was the
bony fleshless one of a skeleton

  above a body dressed in commonplace
clothing the effect was far more dread-
ful than to glimpse an entire skeleton
form

  o-o-oh o-o-oh leona moaned

  her quivering limbs would not carry
her weight she sank lower flesh crawl-
ing with icy terror was that terrible
thing with the skeleton face advancing up
the stairs and what of that other-the
one in aunt judiths room-such a short
distance away-was that gliding noise-
lessly upon her from the rear

  as if in answer to the question she
heard a slight rustling her scalp prickled
at the roots of her hair icy perspiration
drenched her forehead her heart labored
heavily

  another rustling something bent above
her shutting off the air exuding that
odor of the grave that assailed her from
the box hedge when she arrived cold
stiff fingers clamped on her arm an icy
hand touched her cheek went downward
to her throat to linger

  oh god-was this terrible thing going
bedfellow from hell



to choke the life from her body was
she right then to become one of the
dead in that house

   she lapsed into insensibility   

  my dear-what is it there there
poor lamb came vaguely to her ears

  gentle arms held her warm arms that
drew her protectively against a warm
breast the damp hair was smoothed back
from her brow opening her eyes leona
gazed up into mrs grahams face the
pallor of which betrayed her concern

  she was there at the window-again
leona gasped and there was another
-a horrible thing- she could utter
no more and it was many minutes before
she could fully explain the housekeeper
holding her closely while she gasped and
shuddered

  my dear you must get hold of your-
self said the housekeeper firmly your
friends are anxious about you-but we
will fight this thing together it would
be dreadful if you should get to-imagin-
ing these things till they had to take you
away the last words were barely whis-
pered suggesting a horrible thing that
clutched leonas heart to squeeze it with
renewed terror

  you dont mean-that- she could
not go on could not put the grisly fear
into words

  no indeed the housekeeper insisted
stoutly we wont let anyone do a thing
like that youre a brave girl-youll con-
quer your nerves you are not going to
see another thing i shall stay with you
at night after this

  im not really losing my mind
leona thought trying to subdue that dev-
astating panic this is just because im
worn out i must dream-it cant be any-
thing else

ttope that tom would come that day
was in vain but with mid-afternoon
talbot rhone appeared leona had be-

lieved greyport would be a refuge from
his attentions had no idea he revisited
his old home so often

  this is just a call he remarked im
catching the next train back to the city
just wanted to be sure youre making
it all right

  i certainly am she said wishing he
wouldnt look at her like that with the
yellow spots in his eyes fusing into that
dreadful flame

  youre not looking well do you
sleen he asked gravely

  most of the night she evaded not
for worlds would she confess her experi-
ences to him though she felt that he was
willing her to say more she feared him
feared what peeped starkly from his eyes
with sudden alarming clarity of vision
she saw that he would welcome any bar-
rier that set her away from tom he
wouldnt care if i went crazy maybe
thats why he talked as he did about this
house-hoping to frighten me but i
wont let go of myself-i wont imagine
those horrible things again

  rhone left in a few minutes his man-
ner one of friendly solicitude but the
look in his eyes remained with leona

  if the housekeeper slept in the room
adjoining hers leona insisted that would
be sufficient protection against the fright
that held her with a cold grip at thought
of the two previous nights the older
voman insisted upon tucking her into
bed then she raised the shade

  now-take a look across there and
youll see that theres no one in the poor
ladys room

  clasping her hands tight leona looked
across the space to that other window-
it was blank

oh she sighed with a great relief
of taut nerves i didnt see it-i didnt
the proffered glass of hot milk was
taken and leona lay down with a feeling
of real relaxation ive been so fright-


dime mystery magazine

ened she murmured not of ghosts-
but of my own mind ive been afraid-
i might be taken away-where i couldnt
see tom again

  night stillness fell over the big house
mrs graham had retired to her room
and leona slept she had no memory of
being aroused by anything conscious-
ness merely drifted slowly back to her
at first she dimly believed that the house-
keeper had lain down beside her there
was someone in the bed but-strangely
there was no sound of breathing and
the girl was aware of a chill as if some-
thing very very cold were near

  she came wide awake

  somebody was lying close beside her
a someone that was rigid against the
warmth of her own limbs pressed some-
thing hard and chill like marble-only
more terrible her outflung hand came in
contact with an icy dreadful face

  oh god she shrieked in a frenzy
of horror cringing from the dead thing
at her side

  light she must see

  flinging herself over the edge of the
bed she caught the suspended light cord
the room was flooded with brilliance
and on the pillow beside the one on which
leonas head had rested lay a womans
head the hair was parted smoothly in
the middle and brought down over the
ears the features were waxen and rigid
in death under the bedclothes the body
was clearly outlined

  with a cry torn in extremity of terror
from her throat leona ran from the
room she did not even hear the house-
keepers voice as she fled that icy life-
less flesh still seemed pressed against her
the smell of death was in her nostrils
had hell itself opened disgorging all the
evil spirits from its fetid maw her frenzy
of fear would have been no greater

  steps followed her she knew what
they meant-this dead woman was com-

ing after her just as that dead one had
come from aunt judiths room the previ-
ous night to touch her she could not
bear that again she glanced back in
the bedroom door stood the body which
had lain in the bed sightless eyes turned
towards leona

  i cant help it-i cant help it she
screamed frantically it is there i do
see it oh-god-help me

jperror swept her over the border-
land of consciousness into an oblivion
that endured for many hours the new
day was born of the sun before her eyes
opened then her senses seemed drugged
as she remembered feeling after the ad-
ministration of a hypodermic but the
horror of memory pierced her re-creating
the frenzy of the night it seemed to
leona that she could not endure mrs
grahams assurance that she had slept
quietly

  i couldnt have she protested through
pallid quivering lips

  she turned to stare at the pillow be-
side her again her nostrils seemed to
be assailed by that odor of the grave it
lingered about the bed clothing stifled
her a shaking hand pointed at the spot
where death had lain

  a dead body was there she cried
it followed me to the hall it had hair
like the pictures on the walls-oh

  my dear you mustnt let yourself
think these things the housekeeper im-
plored taking the icy hands in her warm
clasp

  i didnt imagine that leona denied
i felt the body its awful chill went
through me i am not losing my mind
i tell you this is a house of dead things
the older woman shook her head as if
helpless to meet the situation perhaps
if we sent for dr carpenter-he lives
in the village-he could help you

  no doctor could help me leona
bedfellow from hell

shuddered she would not risk a medical
mans thinking she conjured these horrors
from within her own mind im going
away from here-after tom comes
later in the afternoon she came to a
sudden decision im going for a walk
she told the housekeeper turning to the
door as the words fell from her lips

  leona walked to the telegraph office
where she sent a message to tom farrell
in care of his companys new york office
it read

    am in dreadful trouble come direct to
  the house no matter what hour you arrive
  in greyport

                          leona wade

  the return to the house did not seem
quite so bad when this word had sped
on its way to tom it was almost like
speaking to him-seemed to bring him
nearer and he would be with her very
soon

  she was greeted with the announce-
ment that during her absence all the pic-
tures of female ancestors had been re-
moved from the walls and stored in the
attic

  i should have thought of it sooner
the housekeeper said they just stared
at you all the time no wonder- her
speech broke off

  leona shivered was mrs graham be-
ginning to think that she was going mad 
was she being kind merely to humor her
till tom came-who would be someone
to assume authority

  the last months had been a protracted
strain culminating in the loss of her
mother and her own physical breakdown
but leona had been thoroughly convales-
cent when she received the heritage of the
old purdy house and she was certain
that whatever her weakness had been her
mind was untouched

  relief at the absence of the pictures
somewhat lessened as evening drew on



leona began to be conscious of the simi-
larity in the various male portraits like
the women there was a resemblance in
the arrangement of the hair brushed
straight back pompadour fashion in each
likeness it was worn more than usually
long she found herself trying not to
look at them yet the picture of great-
aunt judiths father seemed to draw her
eyes

  i shall not sleep upstairs leona an-
nounced as the hour for retiring came
i-couldnt lie in that bed

  very well came the quick sugges-
tion how about the room i first had-
in this wing theres a big bed in it
that will do the girl assented tom
will surely come tomorrow-and he will
take me away hell believe me-what-
ever i tell him    he will know that
there are-dead people here

  id drink this hot milk mrs gra-
ham advised it helps to make you
sleep

  sleep leona shuddered im afraid
to-sleep after last night but she
drank the steaming liquid for she was
cold with the chill that crept over her at
sundown in that house

  well leave the light the housekeeper
said and i shall stay right with you

tor the first time it occurred vaguely
to the girl that it was odd for this
strange woman to take so deep an inter-
est in her to be willing to stay in so lonely
a dwelling under the conditions prevail-
ing even if she herself held no belief
in spirits or the supernatural it could not
be pleasant to endure the existing situa-
tion other questions knocked dully at
the doors of leonas mind-but her senses
were growing heavy-and she welcomed
the state which deprived her of thought
and feeling her eyelids fell shutting
out the brilliantly lighted room

  the interlude of peace was broken into


dime mystery magazine

by the odor that tortured her nostrils it
awakened her it brought back the hor-
rors of those other nights in that min-
ute she knew that she should have run
from the old house-she should not have
been restrained by fear that she would
be called insane because she fled from a
haunted place these things were clear
to her mind in the flash of time before
her eyelids lifted then she saw   
what stood beside the bed

  her heart was riven by the awfulness
of that awakening the devastating horror
of the thing that looked down upon
her   

  thick hair was combed back in a pom-
padour from the bony forehead lipless
jaws grinned black eyeless sockets stared
at her yet-far back within them
seemed to be flame formed of yellow
flecks flame that scorched her flesh
mouldering garments hung on the bony
frame garments like those in the picture
of great-aunt judiths father

  leona did not scream paralysis held
her throat only the horrible crawling
and shrinking of her flesh told her that
she was alive

  the thing that must once have been a
man bent forward arms in the mould-
ered sleeves went out to her the ice of
their touch froze to the very marrow of
her bones she was lifted from the bed
borne to the door

  leona could not close her eyes she
could not move thought was beyond
achievement she could only stare with
tortured eyes that would not close

  into the hall they went it was flooded
with light advancing with a rigid awful
step was the dead woman who had sat in
great-aunt judiths room on the stairs
was the clothed figure with the skeleton
face the foul odor of decay weighted
the air

  the other two moved at the side of the
thing that carried leona and they went

into the parlor in its center they halted
under the blazing chandelier all the pic-
tures of the female ancestors were sus-
pended from the walls and their eyes
were glowing horridly from the canvas

  suddenly the rigid arms tightened about
leona the head bent towards her face
bony jaws approaching her lips she felt
their pressure

  vibrant with agony wild with the in-
sanity of fear rang the scream that burst
from leonas livid lips again and again
that shriek of unearthly terror shattered
the night silence and again and again
that gruesome skeleton mouth came down
to hers

  hideous laughter came from the figure
with pallid flesh

  then there was a crash like the crack
of doom cold air rushed through the
house steps pounded through the hall
as they reached the parlor threshold the
lights went out

  leona a voice shouted

  go away she shrieked frenziedly
away from the house of dead people
theyve got me-dont let them get you

  but the steps did not halt they came
on through the darkness leona was re-
leased with a suddenness that let her fall
to the floor she lay with face pressed
against the polished boards listening to
the mad battle that raged about her

  they were fighting-the dead people
who lived in the old house they were
fighting tom-tom who had come to
rescue her

  leona moaned in wordless agony then
she felt that death had come to her she
too was cold and rigid feeling ceased
and she lay motionless

  nor could she believe that she still lived
that toms arms were about her trem-
bling her forehead clammy heart beat-
ing sluggishly in her breast she lay in
his embrace scarcely seeing his face bent
above her
bedfellow from hell



  leona-you must listen-believe me
there are no dead people here-except
the body talbot rhone mustve brought
and this skeleton dressed in womans
clothing youre alive-and so am i
alive i say

  when he finally compelled her to look
about the room now revealed by the light
he had turned on she saw talbot rhone
lying unconscious from a blow tom had
delivered he was clothed in tattered
mouldy garments a contrivance like a
bony mask over his face

  she looked no further never again
would she gaze on those horrors that had
so nearly cost her reason

  her message had brought tom in time
outside the house he had heard her
scream bursting down the door to get to
her and the plot was easily solved in
the light of calm reasoning talbot rhone
had been ably seconded by his ally mrs
graham a womans dead body from the
morgue a skeleton an opiate in leonas
milk to keep her asleep while they laid
preparations a hypodermic once-to hold
her in oblivion it had been cruelly easy
to plot against the girl so easily might
she have been driven to actual insanity
so nearly did the plot work out

  dead people are worse than ghosts
she whispered clinging to tom as she
left the old purdy house forever

the embalmers

 marmon stood vigil at the side of the girl whom they had pronounced
 dead it was his bernice they were trying to wrest from him-to con-
 sign to the horrible fate of living burial was he a mad man as they
 claimed or was he indeed battling sinister forces that reach beyond the
 very portals of death for their pitiful prey

during ten hours of fast driving
a heightening dread had haunted
marmon-a ghost of fear flying
in the wake of the roadsters spinning
wheels unendurable anxiety tortured
him as he weaved up a graveled drive he
slammed the car to a stop and sprang out


he thrust through the entrance of the
rambling house with a name bursting from
his lips-the name of the girl he loved
bernice bernice

  she appeared suddenly in the library
arch a slender fragile girl of ethereal
luminous beauty suddenly she was in
by oarry grant

a compellingly realistic novelette of eerie terror

his arms marmon held her close stunned
with relief

  youre all right bernice oh god
its good to know youre all right he
-studied her worried eyes-blue as the
space between the singing spheres of the
universe-arms crushing her i started
back as soon as i got your letter i pic-
tured a million horrible things happening
to you what is it bernice what are
you afraid of

  she whispered i dont know im
terribly afraid of-of something but

   theres more-much more-than i
wrote in my letter doug and i have
been almost driven out of our minds
since-

  the girls breath caught marmon
turned sharply the door had opened a
young man was standing on the sill-
douglas hartley bernices younger broth-
er he was white-faced staring breath-




dime mystery magazine

ing rapidly as though from a hard run
inarticulate he stood there transfixed hor-
ror pictured on his clean-cut face-and
mannon was struck sharply by a recollec-
tion of the traditional curse that hovered
over those who lived beneath this roof

  a hartley heritage-fear of the most
ghastly fate that can befall human life
bernices father had narrowly escaped it
only to succumb later as though by the
relentless machinations of an evil destiny
it had claimed bernices three older broth-
ers one after another with the inexorable
certainty of doom the girl and douglas
hartley shared it now-a common terror
they could not shake it was the dread of
being buried alive

  something in douglas hartleys drawn
face as he stood on the sill made it seem
an imminent blood-chilling danger the
dread was in bernices mind too-it was
in marmons own put there by the letter
she had written him which had brought
him racing back to this accursed house

  there was silence until douglas hart-
ley said huskily i came back to get my
gun i saw lights in the cemetery some-
ones there-digging someones opening
one of the graves

  he jerked past marmon and the girl
ran up the stairs marmon felt bernice
tremble in his arms he said quietly
doug and i will look into this hes
wrought up-perhaps he only imagined
the lights stay here darling well be
right back

  the girls brother bounded down with
an automatic target pistol gripped in one
hand he went past marmon breathlessly
breaking into a sprint as he reached the
entrance marmons fingers pressed re-
assuringly on bernices shoulders before
he left her when he hurried past the
house following the path that led deep
into the wood doug hartley was running
ahead

hphree of the victims of the hartley
doom lay interred in the little plot at
the rear of the vast estate it could not
be seen from the house the path wound
through baffling shadows that cloaked
doug hartley with invisibility as marmon
followed it suddenly marmon was con-
scious of quick light footfalls behind him

  bernice was following him she caught
his arm breathlessly i cant stay back
you dont understand grant this-this
is what has been driving doug and me to
the point of madness listen-listen do
you hear it 

  a sound was eddying on the stream of
the night wind it was a quick irregular
rhythm-the noise made by a shovel blade
driving into solid earth someones dig-
ging in the cemetery doug hartley had
said someones opening one of the
graves

   suddenly there was the sound of a shot
-a jarring concussion that shattered the
stillness

  doug the girl screamed her broth-
ers name doug

  she broke away from marmon terror
hurried her to the crest of a hill she was
flying down the far side when marmon
saw the light it was shining deep in the
shallow valley glowing upon a marble
monument black raw earth was heaped
in front of the stone a dark cavity
marked the site of a desecrated grave

   another cry broke from the girls lips
mothers then look that isnt
doug its someone hiding-hiding
bernice stopped short frozen with hor-
ror staring into the gloom beyond the
open grave marmon hurrying past her
saw for one brief instant the figure of a
man leaping from the shadow of another
monument-a man whose face was
masked by darkness the fugitive fired
once-a coppery flash of flame-as he
darted into obscurity marmon stopped
chilled beside the mound of fresh earth
the embalmers



  douglas hartley was lying in the ex-
cavation his chest torn by a bullet-his
face covered by spilled dirt that his own
fall had avalanched upon him from the
edge of the grave loam heaped over his
eyes and mouth and nose was a mocking
portent of the choking death that haunted
the soul of every hartley

 doug

  marmon dropped into the grave seized
the fallen mans shoulders and raised him
the dirt dropped away from a lax white
face doug hartleys head lolled with the
ghastly looseness of death marmon
straightened grimly hands reddened by
blood that had poured from a bullet-burst
heart gazing appalled at a man who had
died in his mothers opened grave-died
under a murderers gun

  bernice

  uncanny silence lay over the little val-
ley there was no answer from the girl
marmon snatched up a flashlight that lay
on the mound he hurried across the
cemetery chilled by apprehension for the
girl cutting the beam intc every shadow

  bernice its grant where are you 

  silence-no answering voice the only
sound was marmon s quick steps head-
stones stood like frozen ghosts inscrutably
keeping their secret as he wound through
them

  bernice bernice p

  a waiiing sob came out of the dark-
ness marmon was startled by a rustle of
branches the flashlight beam revealed
bernice hartley running-running mad-
ly blindly from unendurable horrors
marmon sped after her he was the man
she loved yet the sound of his swift steps
increased her frantic haste

  he bounded to cut her off gripped her
arm she shrank from him lips trem-
bling eyes widened with terror bernice
dont you know me  its grant abrupt-
ly desperately she flung herself into his
arms

 grant take me away take me
away

  listen bernice its all right now
hes gone she was sobbing her hot
breath beating on his cheek did you
see the face of the man with the gun
bernice

  yes

  who was he  answer me

  it was-

  suddenly she was utterly limp in mar-
mons arms her hands dropped her
head lolled a deep sigh came from her
lungs as her every muscle went loose
marmon pressed her close anxiously
looking into her face-a face white as
death

  bernice w

  he lowered her to the ground shes
fainted thats all he told himself fran-
tically-but he was mocked by a gttastly
dread he pressed his ear to her breast-
a breast unmoved by the slightest breath
for a long moment he remained frozen
stunned dy the horrible truth

  no whisper of life came from her heart

chapter two

to claim the dead

ttours had passed since marmon had
returned to the house carrying the
limp body of bernice in his arms he had
immediately called dr fawcett the fami-
ly physician and he had telephoned the
police he scarcely remembered submit-
ting to the questioning of the detectives
who had come from headquarters all the
while he had been thinking of the letter
bernice had sent him now an uncon-
querable conviction filled him reflecting
in his eyes as he gazed at the three others
in the library-a conviction that he had
not lost bernice

  dr fawcett was standing at the fire-
place shaggy head bowed stanley brain-

ard thin and small-eyed the step-father
of bernice and doug hartley had a reti-
cent even furtive manner he enjoyed a
small income from the hartley estate was
rather an ineffectual fixture of the place
-and because of his taciturnity some-
thing of an enigma

  miss caroline brainard his sister a
sentimental spinster had following leti-
tia hartley brainards death some four
months ago come to the house to live

  the room was hushed until marmon
said youre wrong to mourn her she
is not dead

  dr fawcett came to him quietly my
boy you must realize her heart was not
strong she was hysterical just before it
happened cardiac failure my boy-but
please dont insist-

  she is not dead

  dr fawcett winced stanley brainard
turned a protesting gaze upon marmon
caroline brainard took alarm at his sharp
tone marmons shoulders squared as he
went on

  shes asleep-sleeping a sleep so pro-
found you cant distinguish it from death
-but shell soon waken doctor youre
a man of science its not only possible
its happened many times before-once in

like-cataleptic sleep suspended anima-

happened to bernice exactly as it hap-
pened years ago to her father

  that must have been different my
boy the doctor said

  how can you know marmon chal-
lenged you werent the hartleys doc-
tor then

  marmon recalled an episode that was
unforgettably fantastic yet as real as
death itself craven hartley a high-strung
man who worked under terrific nervous
pressure had been found slumped at his

desk and the physician who was then at-
tending the family dr roberts had an-
nounced that he was dead

  marmon vividly remembered the hearse
drawing to the door and simon calder
the undertaker retiring to the room where
craven hartley lay a moment later
calder had burst out of the room face
sheety-white palsied with consternation
they had crowded in to see craven hart-
ley gazing at them smiling rising from
the bier

  what is the matter the dead man
had asked

  months later victim of a grimly ironi-
cal fate craven hartley had been killed
in a mine cave-in in pennsylvania-buried
alive-but only the grace of god had
saved him that night from the poison that
would have seeped through his veins from
simon calders embalming receptacle

 marmon said quietly dr roberts
explained it quite fully cataleptic trance
has been known since the beginning of
history it follows a long illness or an
over-wrought condition-a supreme ef-
fort of nature to rest exhausted nerves
that night craven hartley was enjoying
a profound refreshing sleep with all
vital processes relaxed to such low ebb he
seemed to be dead it is the same now
with bernice she is not dead-only sleep-
ing

  the physician began my boy youre
too stunned to realize-

  marmon removed a letter from his inner
pocket-the letter bernice had sent him
which had stirred such a persistent dread
in his heart-a fear now a thousand times
magnified he handed it silentiy to dr
fawcett

  grant darling

    im frightfully worried so worried i
  cant sleep cant rest cant think of any-
  thing but one ghastly thing im afraid
  terribly afraid that the horrible thing that
the embalmers



  happened to father will happen to me-
  soon

    the day after you left doug and i went
  for a drive we met a gypsy caravan a
  toothless old hag looked at my palm then
  stared at me in the most uncanny way she
  said

    your family is cursed with the fate of
  being buried alive

   i couldnt speak-because you know how
  horribly true it is i had never seen this
  gypsy witch before she knew nothing
  about me except what her supernatural
  vision told her she trembled as she held
  jny hand and went on

   you will die as your father and your
  brothers died it will happen soon destiny
  wills it

    then she ran from me her prophecy has
  been haunting me night and day she only
  spoke the dread that has been in my own
  mind for years but now it has become a
  frightful obsession darling you must un-
  derstand and must make me a promise

    whatever happens to me dont let them
  bury me until you are certain i am dead

                                   bernice

vtarmon said quietly craven hart-
ley died the horrible death of being
buried alive bernices oldest brother juli-
an superintending the excavations for the
lincoln bridge was caught in a landslide
and when they dug him out he was dead
kendall wandering through the west the
next year was thrown from his horse
into a bed of quicksand and he was never
seen again everett foreign correspond-
ent of the times was caught in an earth-
quake in tokio and trapped in a collaps-
ing building buried alive all of them
now bernice-bernice is sleeping but
you wont believe its only that-you want
to treat her like a corpse

  dr fawcett and stanley brainard and
his sister were staring

  god in heaven its what bernice has
been dreading day and night for years
added to that the horror of the thing
that happened to her father-a fear of
being believed dead while she still lives

the dread of being thought a corpse and
made one i

  marmon straightened ive made ber-
nice a promise im going to keep it ill
let no one touch her until i am sure the
spark of life is gone but shes not dead
now i know shes not dead

  his exhausted nerves sent a surge of
dizziness through his brain he climbed
the stairs passed the room where bernice
was lying so silently went into his own
his mind hummed over and over shes
not dead-not dead- and yet god knew
he was not sure

  he heard the sound of a motor outside
the house quiet voices spoke downstairs
but he did not stir soft footfalls in the
hallway aroused him suddenly marmon
jerked out of his chair heart pounding
with frenzied alarm bernices door was
standing open

  he rushed into her room and stopped
in a paralysis of horror staring at the two
men who were bending over the bed ber-
nice was lying on it her eyes closed her
face placid her lips waxen marmon had
left her fully dressed but these two men
had begun to remove her clothing they
had thin preying hands and cadaverous
faces-like evil angels of death who had
come to claim their bounty

  marmon thrust them back straddled
between them and the girl on the bed
dont touch her

  simon calder the undertaker who had
prepared the bodies of four hartleys for
burial in the family cemetery blinked his
amber eyes he said in a husky whisper
i was called by doctor fawcett ive
come to take her away to my-

  shes not dead marmon snapped
do you understand that  shes sleeping
thats all if you embalm her now youll
murder her with your damnable poisons
you saw one hartley rise from the dead
calder i promise you youll see another

toothed assistant moved toward the door
ill speak to the family sir

  marmon stared at the open black case
bn the chair-at ghastly things inside it
used to make the preliminary preparations
for embalming he thrust dotey into the
hall gripped simon calders lapel

  get out of here both of you  get out
of this house i wont let you touch her
they recoiled from the fierceness of
his eyes calder caught up the case of
horrors and retreated down the stairs with
dotey marmon did not move while con-
fused voices sounded in the library-not
until the entrance closed through the
window he saw a shining black hearse
rolling away

  he turned quietly to the bed the girl
lay horribly still her bronze hair splashed
on the pillow her cheeks white her lips
faded there was no breath from her
exquisitely carved nostrils not the slight-
est sign of life in her heart

  bernice he whispered bernice
darling-sleep-rest

  he turned out the lights and left her
lying in the darkness he closed the door
quietly grimly he turned the key and
kept it in his cold clenched hand

jitarmon went into doug hartleys
 room remembering that bernices
brother had owned two pistols he sought
the other he took it from a drawer
grimly he tucked it in his belt and but-
toned his coat

  he was turning away when caroline
brainard came to the sill lieutenant
carmody is here from police headquar-
ters grant he wants to see you
marmon tried bernices door to make
sure it was fast before he went down
carmody was a towering broad-shoul-
dered irishman with sympathetic eyes
they sat facing each other near the fire-
place while stanley brainard and his sis-
ter stood by the detective said quietly

  ive read your statement mr mar-
mon this is very trying for you i know
but we must have more information the
bullet passed completely through young
hartley and we havent found it there
are no clear footprints whoever did this
thing-

  bernice saw the murderer marmon
pointed out she will be able to identify
him beyond all doubt

  carmody started but-shes dead
shes not dead shes only sleeping
she will waken soon

  the detective blinked all this is
damned strange you know he resumed
have you any idea why someone began
to open mrs brainards grave

  i believe bernice knows marmon
said perhaps it wont be long when
she wakens shell tell you with her own
lips

  but-shes dead

  marmon jerked up shes only sleep-
ing how many times must i tell you 
cant you hear-cant you understand
shes not dead-only asleep

  carmody muttered yes-yes of
course mr marmon it is most unfor-
tunate to our case we havent a single
clue pointing to the murderer you de-
clare you are unable to identify him only
miss hartley saw his face and now
shes- he broke off in confusion

  i understand marmon answered
bernices identification is the only pos-
sible means of pinning the guilt on the
murderer she must point him out or he
will never be caught i intend to do every-
thing possible to help bring the guilty man
to justice-thats an added reason for
safeguarding her while shes sleeping
lieutenant but its only a question of
time shell waken soon

  carmody muttered a good-night be-
wildered dismay in his eyes when he
was gone marmon faced stanley and
caroline brainard
the embalmert



  no living person other than bernice
can point out the man guilty of murdering
doug did you hear that clearly no
living person but bernice im going to
watch her day and night until she revives
and speaks his name  you think im
mad dont you  they all think im mad
that doesnt matter

  marmon left the library his mind reel-
ing with nervous exhaustion he stopped
at the door of bernices room and again
made sure it was fastened the key was
in his pocket he turned to dougs study
because it was directly across the hall and
from it he could watch bernices door

  he went in slowly wryly eyeing the
bed there was no dead body lying on it
they had taken doug to the dank odor-
ous morgue-as they wanted to take a
living sleeping girl to murder her offi-
cially and stupidly on a cold slimy slab

  a hush had settled in the house mar-
mon sank wearily into the desk chair he
turned aching eyes on the littered blotter
a sealed legal-size envelope was lying un-
der the light startled marmon saw his
name scrawled across it in dougs flow-
ing script he snatched it up ripped it
drew out a closely typed page

  dear grant

    i am writing this in case something hap-
  pens to me i am filled with a dread that
  my mind may fail or-

  a spidery chill crawled along marmons
nerves an indefinable noise had crossed
the hall from bernices room it came
again-a rustle of movement behind the
locked door a sound that made marmon
hope desperately crazily that the girl he
loved had risen from the living death

  carefully he toe-tipped to the door-
carefully because he remembered a warn-
ing of old dr roberts dead now these
several years that a shock at the recovery
stage might mean eternal death for ber-
nice his heart hammered wildly as he

slipped the key into the lock his breath
stopped as he turned it he opened the
door a crack without sound-and stood
paralyzed with icy horror

  a shadow was bending over the girl
on the bed-the silhouette of a hunched
man with one arm upraised his hand grip-
ping a long-bladed knife a glow on the
opposite wall outlined him sharply-a
phantom being poised to plunge the gleam-
ing weapon into bernices heart

hphe point of the blade glinted down-
ward as marmon broke the icy rigid-
ity that held him he jerked the automatic
out of his belt as he shouldered in the
thump of the flying door quickly turned
the man at the bed he was a faceless
shadow crouching to spring with savage
swiftness he leaped on marmon the knife
slashing an instant before the black body
collided with his marmon fired

  the horror of the sight had slowed his
finger the impact of the fighting man
sent the bullet into the wall he struck
out desperately warding off the arm that
was driving the blade downward twist-
ing away he warned himself that he must
not shoot again because he might hit ber-
nice-bernice who was not dead but only
deeply sleeping-but the man with the
knife came after him with jungle ferocity

  marmon gripped the wrist that held
the weapon and felt the fabric of a glove
he was leaning down striving to wrench
the blade away when a fist exploded
against the side of his head he tumbled
to the floor the world spinning around
him aware of frantically swift movements
in the gloom he glimpsed a shadow on
the sill of the window-a black image
that instantly vanished

  marmon pulled himself up while ex-
cited voices echoed downstairs a crash
sounded before the open window then
running footfalls automatic ready mar-
mon thrust his head out a trellis rose


dime mystery magazine

against the wall beside the window-the
means by which the assailant had entered
the darkness below was tempered by the
shine of the entrance lantern but it was
a dim baffling glow that revealed nothing
of the escaping man marmon turned
back slapping the window down and
stopped gazing in consternation at the
girl on the bed

  he snapped on the lights to see that
she had not moved the crack of the
automatic had not disturbed her her eyes
were still closed her face still placid her
lips waxen the sheet had been pulled
back to bare her breast for the plunge of
the knife-a breast unstirred by any per-
ceptible breath

  he forced himself past her out the
door he turned the key in the lock be-
fore he bounded down the stairs caroline
brainard was in the lower hall staring
in bewilderment the entrance was open
marmon hurrying out caught a dark
movement near a group of blue spruces
and sprang toward it the man who
twisted gasping out of his grasp was
stanley brainard

  whatre you doing out here mar-
mon demanded

  i heard a noise what in gods name
happened why are you looking at me
like that 

  im not the only one who thinks ber-
nice is alive someone else believes it-
the man who just tried to kill her
brainard stared inarticulately into mar-
mons fierce eyes marmon ran along the
garden path circled back to the entrance
there was no sign of the fugitive in the
darkness he had vanished as swiftly as
completely as the murderer of douglas
hartley had disappeared from the shelter-
ing shadow of the tombstone

  marmon thrust past the ashy-faced
brainard climbed the stairs paused at the
room of the girl he loved he unlocked
the door quietly stepped in the change-

lessness of the girl on the bed struck cold
dread into his heart he bent over her
called her name softly but her waxen lips
gave no response in despair he turned
away his eyes aching-and he saw the
knife

  it was lying in the center of the room
where marmon had fallen-a curved
blade needle-pointed razor-sharp mar-
mons blood pounded hotly as he covered
his hand with his handkerchief took its
carved ebony handle into his fingers
quickly he left the room locking the door
behind him

  at the end of the hall he thrust into the
room occupied by stanley brainard it
was cluttered with relics from the four
corners of the earth-spears swords
shields directly over brainards desk a
copper scabbard was hanging it was the
sheath into which this curved murder
blade fitted

  marmons jaw-muscles bulged as he
went down the stairs he strode directly
to brainard at the fireplace he said
tightly

  this is yours it came from your room
i got it away from the man who tried to
kill bernice

  brainard blurted kill her shes
already dead you must be mad

  marmon went on grimly there must
be a reason why you insist bernice is
dead she and doug had a quarter mil-
lion each left them in trust by their
mother there is no doubt of dougs
death his share goes to bernice if ber-
nice is living shes the last of the hart-
leys and if she dies the estate goes to
you brainard by the terms of the will
brainard choked in gods name you
cant think me capable-

  you love luxury youve stayed in
this house since letitias death reveling
in its comforts you like to satiate your-
self with rich amusements on the sly but
she didnt leave you much-only a modest
the embalmers



income not enough-is that it brain-
ard

  you cant say that

  you began to think perhaps bernice
is still alive that one vital fact would
keep half a million out of your hands
you thought everyone else believes shes
dead and they think marmon is mad-ill
make sure perhaps a little bribe paid
to simon calder would keep everyone
from learning about the knife-wound
one hard thrust into bernices heart and
youd be sure of the half million brain-
ard

  brainard snapped you dont know
what youre saying

  marmon said grimly there is one
thing we must not forget bernice saw
the man who killed doug thats why he
came back to make sure she would never
live to identify him-but she will shell
speak his name shell rise to name the
murderer

chapter three

drug of doom

a soft knock echoed in the room
where bernice hartley lay uncannily
still where grant marmon sat a grim
sentry at the portals of doom

  a day of torture had passed-and now
the beginning of another night of torment
marmon had not opened the bolted door
he had not eaten had not slept all the
while the girl had lain motionless shroud-
ed with silence-silence disturbed now by
the rap on the door

  its caroline a quiet voice said
you cant keep this up grant if you
insist on staying there to watch her per-
haps youd like coffee ive brought some
please open the door

  marmon pulled himself up he braced
the door with his foot as he opened it
he put trembling hands on a silver tray

bearing a pot of coffee and a cup it
wont be long-im sure it wont at
once he shot the bolt

  grant wont you come out caroline
asked through the panels wont you lie
down and rest 

 rest marmon snapped the mo-
ment i close my eyes theyll come for her
like vultures i cant let myself sleep
he poured the cup full of steaming cof-
fee and gulped it down it seemed weak
and strangely acrid but marmon took a
second cup and a third he gazed tenderly
at the girl on the bed who lay so still he
had begun to dread to turn his eyes upon
her the one infallible test of death
he had read it somewhere-the words
haunted marmon the putrefaction of
the body    marmon tore his eyes
away   

  the coffee was having no stimulating
effect on him instead he found it harder
to fight off sleep    the letter douglas
hartley had written marmon drew it
from his pocket he had read and reread
it feeling that somewhere between its
lines the answer to the murder riddle lay
-an enigma which only bernice could
answer his aching eyes jerked from
word to word as he strove again to solve
its riddle

   i am filled with a dread that my mind
  may fail or that the doom of the accursed
  hartleys may claim me

   you remember dads wedding gift to
  mother the diamond necklace which dad
  had made according to his own desiga
  mother loved it so much she stipulated in
  her will that it was to be buried with her
  we all saw it at her throat when the lid
  of the casket was bolted down we know
  the necklace went with her into her grave

 marmon shook his head to clear his
senses fatigue was spinning a blinding
web before his stinging eyes he forced
himself to read on

    the next day after bernice became so


dime mystery magazine

  upset by tbe gypsys prophecy-she and i
  went to dinner at mrs marstons mrs
  marstons house guest was mrs livermore
  from chicago bernice and i kept staring
  at the diamond necklace mrs livermore
  was wearing it was mothers-we kept
  telling ourselves it was impossible-bat we
  knew it was mothers

    we asked mrs livermore polite ques-
  tions she had bought the necklace from a
  reputable jeweler when she allowed me to
  examine it more closely i looked at the
  clasp mother had had hers engraved-c
  to l i was almost delirious with relief
  when i saw the clasp of mrs livermores
  necklace was not enscribed at all but then
  she explained

     i had the clasp replaced when f bought
  it the original was initialed-c to l i
  think

     understand grant the necklace itself is
   not the vital thing to us it was mothers
   but now it is somehow rightly mrs liver-
   mores to bernice and me it was an indi-
   cation of something else the syttfbal of a
   fear striking at the very roots of our minds
   we kept asking ourselves what has hap-
   pened what has happened somehow we
   must learn the answer or else weh go mad

  the page was blearing before mar-
mons eyes he fought the numbness that
iwas enveloping him and stated at the
swimming words

    you remember grant how profoundly
  mother was disturbed by dads death-
  how she dreaded the same horror happen-
  ing to her she made us promise that when
  the time came and she seemed to have died
  we would ot permit her body tp be em-
  balmed we granted her wish sftid waited
  until at last we were sure and we were
  sure when we buried her yet-is she lying
  there in her grave now or was she still
  alive when her casket was lowered into the
  grave-and did someone know it-aud was
  she somehow disinterred-and is she alive
  now somewhere in this world hidden from
  us by a secret cloud that rose with her at
  her resurrection

    the necklace-we always come back to
  the necklace what does it mean  how can
  it exist in the land of the living while moth-
  er remains in the realm of the dead that

   is the thought torturing us is mother dead
   and in her grave or is her coffin empty

 marmons head was whirling he
opened the window drew deep breaths
the fresh air cleared his senses a little

    bernice and i have desperately tried to
  think it out logically-but there is no logic
  there is only the horrible conviction that
  our dead is not dead that the grave is
  vacant yes we tried first we questioned
  simon calder

    you saw the necklace at her throat when
  i closed the casket calder said and you
  remained with her until the grave was
  filled

    we even dared confront stanley brain-
  ard was the necklace we buried with
  mother the real one we asked him had
  artificial stones been substituted without
  mothers knowing the difference it was
  tantamount to accusing him of theft and
  of course he denied it yet i wonder-

 marmon blurted god i cant let my-
self break now theyre waiting-wait-
ing for it if i let myself go theyll take
bernice away theyll kill her-kill her
with their stupidity-if i dont keep hold
of myself

    wonder-horrible uncertainty-it is con-
  suming our minds we cant endure it any
  longer the only way we may be sure is
  to open mothers grave yet god knows we
  cant do that whether her casket is empty
  or whether she is lying in it-god help us
  -will we ever learn

                               doug

titarmon groped to the door gazing
in despair at the girl lying so still
so white on the bed bernices mother
had lain like that day after day while
her tortured children waited for the cer-
tainty of her death-certainty that now
months later a dead son was questioning
perhaps bernice would never rise per-
haps hers was the sleep of eternity per-
haps   

 marmon tried to make no sound as he
the embalmers



turned the key in the lock and went along
the hallway quietly he entered the room
that had been letitia brainards it was
musty as if filled with the breath of a
tomb scarcely able to find his way to the
desk marmon fumbled an old scrap book
from a drawer and turned to a photograph
of a diamond necklace

  a ragged line of type on the yellowed
clipping announced that this halftone pic-
tured craven hartleys wedding present
to his wife the highlights grew blind-
ingly bright in marmons eyes moved and
danced before him bewitched things
swirling like storm-torn constellations-
stars waltzing through cosmic space black
as all eternity profound darkness poured
into marmons mind   

  far far away he heard footfalls and
voices-sounds from another world-as
he strove to rise but he could not move
an interminable period passed-ages and
eons-before he felt volition returning to
him when he forced himself up unstead-
ily the footsteps and voices were gone-
the house was hushed

  he started toward bernices door-
then a sob breaking from his lips he
flung himself forward her room door
was standing open he stumbled in star-
ing at the bed where she had lain-a bed
now empty he shouted bernice as he
swayed to the window and stared down
to see fresh tire tracks in the driveway
bernice as he twisted back in terror

  he stopped short staring at the silver
coffee pot standing on the tray a cold
suspicion helped clear his mind a trickle
of the dark brew remained in it-and a
half-melted tablet he propelled himself
out of the room as quick footfalls came
up the stairs

  he gripped caroline brainards shoul-
ders where is she where have they
taken her you drugged me-you put
something in my coffee so you could steal
her away-

  the woman sobbed please grant
you were on the point of collapse it was
just a few sleeping tablets we were sure
about bernice-it was too horrible-you
were driving yourself mad-

  you fool you fool marmon shook
the woman where is she where have
they taken her

  its too late grant she screeched
simon calder took her away do you
hear its too late

  marmon sped down the stairs jerked
out the entrance ran reelingly to the
garage he fell into his roadster twisted
blindly at the ignition kicked at the start-
er with the engine roaring he whirled
down the drive hurled the car into the
boulevard in insane haste he started to-
ward the mortuary of simon clader

  its too late

  pavement flowed under the headlights
in a blurring stream it was a delirium
long and maddening while marmon flew
interminably through empty space yet
the cold rushing wind cleared his brain
and when he drew near the amber lighted
house he acted with consummate caution

  the mortuary was a somber dwelling
of the dead shrouded by the funereal glow
of its chapel windows marmon stole to-
ward a shining black hearse which sat
backed to broad doors at the rear the
hearse was open and empty marmon
crept to a door set in a whitewashed wall
he brought the automatic into his hand
as he stepped into a cement corridor that
was cold and reeking with the scent of
death

 behind another door movements
sounded lowered voices spoke with the
utmost care marmon turned the knob and
opened a crack he looked into the em-
balming chamber

two men were at work near an enamel
table-simon calder and arthur dotey
they were adjusting a tank full of pre-
servative fluid uncoiling rubber hose a
dime mystery magazine

sharp surgical implement was in calders
hand as he bent forward--a blade used to
open the veins of corpses for the admis-
sion of the embalming poison he half
turned away and marmon saw the nude
girl on the slab-bernice

  dont touch her

f i he men jerked up twisting around

	the knife dropping from calders
hand rang on the cement floor dotey
retreated his face whiter than that of the
girl marmons gun covered them as tie
tnade sure swiftly that the keen edge of
the knife had not yet marred bernices
smooth skin he straightened grimly
when calder said acidly

  if you dont go youll suffer for it

  marmon felt along the wall twisted a
knob opened a closet it was cluttered
with the ghastly appurtenances of the
embalming chamber he stepped to the
side of the table where the girl lay his
gun waving get in there both of you
he ordered i swear to god ill shoot
you if you dont

  the two men retreated into the closet
dotey was quaking with fear simon
calders narrowed eyes gleamed venom-
ously marmon blotted away their faces
with the dopr dragged a chair close
braced it under the knob then he turned
to the girl who lay naked on the table
still and cold

  marmon brought a robe from the hearse
and whipped it over her he lifted her in
his arms a waxen limp burden he car-
ried her out of the chamber through the
darkness to his car as he placed her
itenderly beside him- he realized that cal-
der and dotey were even then striving to
break out of the closet that a few seconds
anight bring the police

  the hot motor caught at once marmon
cut sharply f rom the curb seeking dark
streets traveling swiftly as he dared the

  name of bernice on his lips--unspoken
because she could not answer

   but she isnt dead    she isnt dead

  when marmon turned down a rough
dirt road an eternity later a lake rippled
in the beams of his headlamps he braked
at a log cottage by the waters edge the
air was cold and the camps marmon
knew were deserted by their summer
tenants he had often swum here with
bernice and canoed in the moonlight

  he broke the lock he took her into
his arms and carried her into the deep
gloom inside he placed her on a bed
wrapped the robe snugly around her
looked long at her white still face

  rest bernice--rest darling

  he left her in the silent darkness his
heart as cold as hers and drove away
alone

chapter fouil

ghouls gamble

tthe private cemetery of the hartleys
lay hushed among the pines its sigh-
ing serenity disturbed only by the mourn-
ful calling of owls the grave of letitia
hartley brainard yawned in the dark-
ness untouched since tlie body of her mur-
dered son had been lifted from its shallow
depths

  he had wound his way along unfre-
quented back roads had descended into
the valley of the dead while avoiding the
house cautious that men from headquar-
ters might be standing guard he listened
to every furtive night-sound sure at last
he was alone he went with slow quiet
steps to the half-opened grave

  the shovel used by douglas hartley
had been taken away by the police but
marmon had brought another small and
collapsible from the kit of his car he
lowered himself into the grave he drove
the blade into the earth and worked with-
the embalmers



out a light listening tautly his nerves
burning with anxiety

  bit by bit marmon deepened the cavity
his every sense snapped to alertness when
the steel struck something hard with a
hollow muffled sound he felt a damp
board-the lid of the coffin of bernices
mother

  each scrape of the shovel over the wood
seemed to rasp along marmons spine
he brought a heavy screwdriver from his
pocket and worked at the fastenings of
the cover-an exhausting awkward or-
deal he struggled up pried the lid loose
heaved it out of the hollow the casket
of letitia hartley brainard lay exposed

  marmon plied a wrench at the bolts of
the headpiece panting with the effort
sharp creaking sounds the protest of
rusty metal aroused an echoing stir
among the trees one by one marmon
loosened the studs twisted them free he
fingered at the hinged section bracing
with all his strength lifting it

  he paused nauseated by the fetidity
that swirled around him thought of
facing the thing that lay beneath him now
-or the emptiness that would mock him
with a greater mystery-was an almost
unbearable pain he forced himself lit-
tle by little toward the inevitable moment
the light gleamed

  one short moment then it was out
marmon kept his position stunned with
the certainty that he could never forget
the thing he had seen it was not a face
nothing that could ever have been human
-but it was there the light had revealed
in repellant horror all that was left of
a woman who had met the infallible proof
of death and in the bright shine during
that incredible moment the stones of a
necklace had twinkled

  marmon reached into the casket his
soul revolted while he strove to find the
necklace he groped in darkness finger-
tips stretching a fraction of an inch at a

time-and at the first touch of precious
metal he tore back he had it-had it
in his numb trembling hand-the neck-
lace

  with mad haste he thrust it into his
pocket pushed the leaf down rapidly
but with almost tender care he twisted
the bolts tight he lowered the wooden
cover replaced it swung the shovel
quickly he refilled the grave to its former
level-and as he was climbing out he
heard footfalls along the path

  marmon heaved up breathless clutch-
ing the automatic the footfalls stopped
abruptly a gruff voice called whos
that a blinding beam of light shot
through the trees it shafted upon mar-
mon as he whirled into a stumbling run
with the flash beam wavering behind him
he plunged among the trees while a man
gave hard chase

  a hand gripped marmons arm lieu-
tenant carmody studied marmons hag-
gard face his sharp eyes glittering
what have you been doing marmon 
marmon snapped let go of me
carmody answered i stopped in the
house to pick you up the chief wants to
talk to you there are no witnesses to
bear out your statement you know-it
doesnt sound straight to us we want to
find out if you had a reason-sane or in-
sane-for killing douglas hartley

he was the brother of the girl i love
were wondering carmody said
whether that isnt what killed her-the
shock of seeing her fiance murder her
brother

the drive of marmons fist into car-
modys face was an explosive protest
he could not control the detective
blurred back in the darkness the light
dropped from carmodys hand as mar-
mon savagely struck again marmon fell
on him snatched the gun carmody was

fumbling to get hurled it far among the
trees then madly he ran into the maze
of shadows

  marmon drove with mad shrewdness
and speed he kept to the back roads
with the radio playing he waited for
some hint of an alarm that the police had
ordered a hunt for him but none came
he pulled to a stop at last in front of
an apartment building

  he left the elevator at the seventh
floor went to a door knocked insistently
this was the apartment of a man whom
marmon knew-the jeweler from whom
he had purchased bernices engagement
ring who had years earlier fashioned the
hartley necklace a sleepy voice asked
through the panels

  who is it

  grant marmon open the door

  he stepped past a white-headed man
whose beard was ruffled by sleep mar-
mon looking around said wait he
strode into the bathroom held the neck-
lace in a stream of water until it was
quite clean

  look at that he directed

  the old man took it into blue-veined
fingers he shook his hoary head ambled
to a desk fixed a lens in his eye

  paste he said

  marmon thrlist the necklace into his
pocket strode out he went to his car
warily he turned into the highway lead-
ing to the hartley estate

  the sedative still numbed his mind
but he forced himself to think when he
reached a side road near the hartley
home he left the roadster lightless
climbed a stone wall crossed a field
toward lighted windows he entered the
garden stealthily looked into the library

  carmody was there one cheek marked
by a cut talking earnestly to stanley
brainard marmon strained to catch each
word

  he cant be far away he couldnt

have taken the girl a very long distance
and he wouldnt leave her im going to
let him think hes getting away with it
while i build up a case in any event
removing a dead body is a serious of-
fense

 dead body the mocking words
turned marmons thoughts again to the
girl lying alone and still

  suppose he hated douglas hartley
without letting on-hated hartley enough
to kill for some reason we havent found
out yet-but he loved the girl marmon
didnt intend her to see him commit the
murder but she did the shock of it
killed her thats why he cant admit
even to himself hes responsible for the
death of the girl he loved

  stanley brainard insisted its not
rational-the way he insists my step-
daughter is still alive perhaps a des-
perate need for money-a crazy attempt
to transfer the whole hartley fortune to
bernice so he could marry into it he de-
nies shes dead because if he admits the
fact he knows his murder was in vain-
hes lost it all

  carmody answered im playing it
slow and careful thats the way to han-
dle an insane person-let him hang him-
self well-good night

  marmon sidled out of the glow of the
entrance lantern as the door opened
carmody trudged out a car ground
down the drive marmon drifted around
the house opened the way quietly went
along the hall with slow tread he was in
the living-room before brainard was
aware of it

trainard started grew white as a
sheet grant the police are look-
ing for you youve gone too far-
youve betrayed yourself

  marmon asked tightly how much
did you get for the necklace brainard
brainard mumbled what
the embalmers



  marmon heard caroline brainard
come into the room behind him his eyes
leveled at brainards cold and intense as
he stood with fists clenched he went
on tightly

  the necklace-letitia hartleys-cost
two hundred thousand the paste dupli-
cate was much less wasnt it--and she
never knew the difference we all thought
it was real when it was buried with her-
except you i have it here- would you
like to see it

  good god grant f brainard ex-
claimed youre accusing me-

  the necklace glimmered in marmons
palm sold to one fence then to an-
other then to a jeweler and finally to a
woman named livermore-a deadly cir-
cle brainard and it trapped you you
understood why bernice and doug were
so disturbed lately you remembered the
questions theyd asked you about the
necklace you wanted to remove the cas-
ket from the grave you were afraid of
going to prison brainard-so afraid you
committed murder to escape it

  you are mad

  marmon took a slow step forward
madmen are dangerous brainard they
stop at nothing-yes im like that now
im going to beat the truth out of you
grant caroline brainard protested
with breathless anxiety if you strike
him ill call the police

  he looked around the woman had
already lifted the telephone receiver her
face was ashen her eyes terrorized mar-
mon knew she would keep her promise
it was not fear of arrest that brought
mm to a pause but thought of bernice
cnce jailed he would be powerless to stop
them

  youre right caroline marmon said
quietly after all its not necessary
bernice saw the man who murdered
doug she has only to speak his name
when she wakens

  he strode out the entrance as he
trudged across the garden he felt a dewy
chill along his spine a cold instinctive
warning that he was being watched per-
sisted even when he suddenly left the
path leaped the wall and cut across the
field to the car

  he sped toward the lake winding
through the back roads at once haunted
by the sensation that he was being fol-
lowed and driven by a consuming anxiety
to reach bernice but when he swung
near the water he felt sure he had shaken
the unseen trailer

  she was lying in the darkness still as
he had left her silent as the night that
shrouded her he knelt at her side he
fought down a mounting grief a despair
that threatened to overwhelm him as her
name rose yearningly to his lips

  bernice    bernice 

  a sound for a long moment hedared
not raise his head had he heard a whis-
pered word had those cold lips spoken
perhaps it was only his fevered imagina-
tion tricking him the madness of his
mind mocking him that wraith of sound
still hovering in the air

black house of death

trading embers lay on the hearth

    yellow lights filled the living-room of
the hartley house with a soft glow
quiet even footfalls disturbed the still-
ness of the early morning hours-stan-
ley brainard walking back and forth in
front of the fireplace his sister sat
watching him her eyes compassionate
her lips working with unspoken words
until at last she said

  you wouldnt keep the truth from me
stanley

  brainard paused tires were gritting


dime mystery magazine

in the driveway he opened the entrance
as the car stopped dr fawcett shivered
with the chill of the coming dawn

  youre mad he said the house is
full of irrational people calling me out
of bed at this hour of the night

  ive got to be sure brainard plead-
ed i want to know definitely once and
for all whether bernice hartley is really
dead if its possible marmons right if
its possible shes still alive-

  fawcett grunted do you want de-
tails  i made the ausculation test i held
a mirror at the girls nostrils and no dew
gathered i placed a downy feather on her
upper lip and it did not stir i placed a
saucer of water on her chest and there
wasnt a ripple those are respiratory
proofs mr brainard

  yes

  the physicians scowl deepened the
conjunctiva of her eye had become in-
sensitive there was a loss of body heat
the cadaver exhibited primary flaccidity
giving way to rigor mortis the post-
mortem lividities were in evidence pu-
trefactive changes are sure to follow
is there any reason doctor- brain-
ard asked it carefully-any reason why
you would wish to believe bernice dead
though she were really in a state of cata-
leptic trance

  again the physician officiously cleared
his throat i am a man of science he
answered i am stating facts i did not
come here mr brainard to be insulted
a quiet step turned them their eyes
widened at the young man who appeared
on the sill his cheeks were darkened
with a beard his eyes haggard with ex-
haustion his shoulders were sagging and
he was trembling as if with the chill of the
dawn it was marmon

  ive brought her back he said
caroline brainard rose tensely from her
chair she came slowly to marmon then

tried to pass him he stopped her with
an out-stretched arm

  where is she grant

  upstairs in her room please dont
go up now

  the woman faltered we didnt hear
you come in

  the side door he explained i didnt
want anyone to see stay here wont you
-all of you 

  brainard and fawcett watched him si-
lently as he went to the telephone he
opened the telephone book thumbed down
a column they saw him guide his finger
with difficulty as he spun the dial

  is that the simon calder mortuary
he squared his shoulders is that mr
simon calder speaking he took a slow
laborious breath this is grant marmon
i am at the hartley house mr calder
you had best-come at once

  brainard was studying marmons face
while his own was eaten deep with black
lines dr fawcett went to marmon with
an elaborately gentle gesture

  let me give you something to ease
your nerves my boy youve got to rest
or-

  im all right marmon brought him-
self erect theres nothing to do but
wait for simon calder

  marmon eyed them intently they low-
ered themselves uneasily into chairs lis-
tening for the first sound of a car in the
drive the dimming coals in the fireplace
made faint crinkling noises the mantel
clock ticked softly surprisingly soon the
hum of an engine approached the house

  it was lieut carmody he came in
warily as marmon stood back i had a
report you were here he said quietly
now then come along

  in just a little while lieutenant we
are waiting simon calder is due here

fphe light in marmons eyes was so
strange the detective made no move
i the embalmers

 j

to stop him he walked back to the living-
room carmody entered it rubbing his
numb hands still eying marmon alertly
brainard said quietly

   hes brought her back

  were waiting marmon repeated
for simon calder lieutenant are you
going to press charges against me for
assaulting an officer i mean

   i can overlook that carmody an-
swered wryly i want a confession
marmon made a groping gesture tits
a little difficult lieutenant im not quite
sure of everything that happened it seems
like a nightmare most of it it will be
hard to separate the real from the unreal
carmody nodded take your time
marmon

   now the sound of another car was pene-
trating the hush of the dawn marmon
turned quietly to the entrance holding
the door wide he watched the hearse ap-
proach bright shining black it backed
to the house dotey climbed down from
the wheel and opened the rear doors
simon calder came toward marmon car-
rying his black case

   the undertakers narrowed eyes gleamed
hostility as marmon followed him along
the hall he paused to ask where is
she marmon gestured and answered
go into the living-room first mr cal-
j der the undertaker lowered his case

 went through the door uncertainly mar-
j mon faced them all

 i have already asked lieutenant car-
i mody a question i must ask you too mr
calder he said are you going to
charge me with felonious assault 

   calder answered i would be fully jus-
j tified i consider it an outrage ill prom-
ise you nothing

   the bitter twist returned to marmons
ups to carmody he said you are seek-
j ing a murderer lieutenant and you be-
lieve i am guilty i have also been hunt-
ing him and i suspected stanley brain-



ard only one person ever knew the truth
other than the murderer himself-bernice
hartley you wish a confession lieuten-
ant and perhaps youll have it we may
be sure of one fact the murderer is here
in this room now

  marmons gaze turned to stanley
brainard during a moments tight hush
ill give you all the facts lieutenant car-
mody-clean-cut and conclusive all of
them or perhaps mr calder will give
them to you instead

  the undertaker snapped what the
devil are you talking about

  the necklace marmon answered
quietly a week passed between letitia
brainards death and her burial-all the
time needed for the making of the dupli-
cate you used the newspaper photograph
as a pattern you handled the exchange
very deftly because none of us suspected
the necklace placed in the casket was
paste

  the twinkling string dangled from mar-
mons extended hand

  and you knew bernice and douglas
hartley had discovered it you were
warned by the questions they asked you
you watched them for fear the truth
would be revealed thats why you hid
night after night in the cemetery near the
grave containing a corpse youd robbed
it meant ruin and prison for you calder
-thats why you stopped douglas hartley
with a bullet 

  calder was standing rigid his eyes
stony let him finish hes mad you
can see it in his eyes hes accusing me
to shield himself

  marmon pressed on grimly how
often have you done that calder-robbed
the bodies entrusted to you many per-
sons want to take their treasures to the
grave with them the cemeteries of the
world hide untold fortunes in jewels bur-
ied with their owners youve stolen from
the dead again and again havent you


dime mystery magazine

calder you were afraid it would all
come out with the opening of letitia
brainards casket

  calder repeated contemptuously hes
mad

  marmons fist clenched on the false
stones you tried to kill bernice too be-
cause she saw you fire the shot your
bullet missed and you had to rush from
the cemetery because i was coming-but
you were playing in luck werent you
calder you came back to knife a girl
who a doctor swore was dead because you
didnt dare wait a wound only you would
have seen and you would have said noth-
ing you filthy devil-

  the undertaker sneered you havent
the slightest proof of what you say you
admit yourself the girl is the only eye-
witness and shes-

  he broke off in a gasp his widened
eyes gazed past marmon through the
door dr fawcett stood transfixed lieu-
tenant carmody muttered a broken
prayer stanley brainard recoiled his
sister swayed as if about to faint a rustle
sounded as a girl paused in the doorway

  her face had lost the pallor of death
her lips were ripe red again her cheeks
rich with color her eye were bright her
manner composed she was fully smartly
clothed glowing with refreshed vitality
she smiled as she came to marmons side

  bernice he asked quietly whom did
you see kill your brother

  simon calder

hphe undertaker broke away from his
position so violently so suddenly a
chair toppled to its side he twisted
toward the door dragging a revolver from
his hip pocket consternation held car-
mody motionless until the weapon was
leveled calder waved it covering every
person facing him backing to the door

  what are you going to do calder
he asked quietly do you think you can

get away now its too late-much too
late

  calder was turning the black muzzle at
bernice his wizened body was trem-
bling drawing taut an insane fury
smouldered in his eyes as he began to
squeeze the trigger the hammer of the
revolver rose  rose   

  the gun cracked at the instant marmon
leaped calder lurched arms upthrown
the bullet furrowed into the ceiling and
flakes of plaster rained bernice hartley
clung breathless to marmons arm cal-
der whirled into the hall was pointing the
revolver again marmon stood in front
of the girl protecting her as carmody
turned to the french windows

  the detective slipped out into the grey
light as calder sped to the entrance the
undertaker drew up with a gasp glimps-
ing carmody at the side of the hearse
carmodys one hand was on the steering
wheel defying calder to touch it his other
was leveling his police positive calder
pointed his revolver full at the detectives
chest flattening against the black side of
the hearse

  dont stop me he warned

  backing calder suddenly spun-to face
marmon marmon was coming out the
entrance he took slow steps toward cal-
der smiling tensely his advance challeng-
ing the gun calder retreated before the
inexorable sureness of marmons deliber-
ate march the undertaker whirled eyes
flashing with terror and sprang to the
step of the hearse he lunged in pulling
the black doors shut

  a muffled shot boomed inside the car-
rier of the dead

  marmon turned away bernice was in
his arms he held her close hungry for
the warm softness of lips that once had
been cold looking into clear bright eyes
that once had been closed as if forever
her vitality brought ease to hi soul

  you see he said she was only sleep-

terror held a great city in its paralyzing grip while girls whose verf
youth and beauty condemned them to horrible death cowered alone
behind locked doors-where their danger was greatest

by dale clark

author of my friend the corpse etc

 horror hung like a black pall the curtainless squad cars patrolling the
 over chicago that january of pavements the lines of people in the
  a horror that centered over stores clamoring for locks-the newest
 rogers park the northerly and fairly af- strongest guaranteed to be pick-proof
 fluent district where the outrages centered locks the grim-faced husbands who




dime mystery magazine

crouched behind those locks night after
night clutching their ready freshly
greased loaded revolvers

  and the uselessness of locks and
guns   

  sleepless and infuriated men rode the
el in the mornings each glaring at his
neighbor with hot suspicion the wan
terrified faces of girls who fled on tap-
tapping heels through the wintry dusk to
barricade themselves in their kitchenette
apartments-where they should have been
safe and where actually the danger was
greatest t

  the stark screaming inky headlines on
the papers the descent of swarms of
newspaper hustlers upon some silent
street in the dead of night and the fierce
brawling of their voices thundering up to
the lighted windows

  fiend in de block hey uxtry read-
allaboutit fiend in dis block

  the cordons of police closing in-under
the personal supervision of detective lieu-
tenant clubb in charge of the special de-
tail-but finding nothing absolutely
nothing except of course the latest vic-
tim   

the night club singer lying nude on
the floor of her apartment-horribly
bruised and mutilated her blood besplat-
tering the walls of the room her throat
torn as if by the claws or fangs of some
enormously powerful animal her doors
and windows were locked the actress
her sac de nuit ripped to shreds and her
body shredded by those fangs or claws
her windows were fastened and the doors
locked with new locks    the dancer-
she had her door locked and barred and
the windows nailed down

  it was the dancer who lived to gasp
out a few words circle of fire   
phantom    what could that mean

  there were others false alarms to be
sure in no part of the city could a purse

be snatched or a woman frightened by a
shadow but the cry of fiend was
raised discount also the stories told by
hysterical or publicity seeking women who
claimed to have beaten off the monsters
attack the real cases followed closely to
a grim pattern

  the terror of it a wild scream ring-
ing out in some apartment building a
sound of furniture smashing frightful
cries and snarls as the brief struggle pro-
ceeded  the onrush of neighbors breaking
down the door-then no sign or trace of
the fiend how could that be  the man
or animal or whatever it was must have
been covered with the victims blood how
did it pass through the police net

  and the circumstances-so similar so
baffling always the victims were young
and beautiful women and with the mys-
terious allure which is called sex ap-
peal generally the attacker swooped
upon them late at night yet there were
the two brides whose husbands worked
in the loop-they were slain by broad
daylight generally too the fiend found
his prey alone-though once two girls
and again a man and his wife were de-
stroyed

  always the firmly locked doors and
windows and invariably a radio turned
on full blast flooded some wild gay dance
tune over the disordered bloodied room
and the horribly mangled clawed body

  but the doors and windows 

  in the name of heaven what manner
of thing was this that melted into thin
air or passed through solid walls 

  fear swelled a frenzied exodus by
every train and bus beautiful and delecta-
ble women fled the accursed city hus-
bands sent away their brides and fathers
the daughters that no man could protect
against the mysterious and invisible as-
sailant    the world had seen nothing
like it since whole medieval populations
panicked into flight from the black death

  then the night of the th and
moving through the swirling chaotic hell
vapors the figure of charles forture-in
that building on the very shore of lake
michigan with the ice floes grating at its
foundations and the freezing spray dim-
ming the windows   

   but let him tell it

  here begins charles fortures story

t y profession i am a chemist by
education a graduate of the univer-
sity of minnesota i played football at
school and since have kept in pretty good
condition through boxing and handball
ive been steadily employed dating from
 by the firm of beckley  beckley

  not that i expect anyone to be inter-
ested in me the point is that im physi-
cally and mentally at least normal a little
on the scientific and skeptical side and
not a physical coward my main fault is
that im too easy going good natured and
in a way unimaginative

  for instance last january i wasnt
much impressed by the great fiend scare
mostly newspaper talk as it seemed to
me that is until   

  but here i mustnt get ahead of myself
not being a professional author or any-
thing like that ill just have to tell the
thing the way it happened consequently
i wont start out by chilling your blood in
the first paragraph-the way those writ-
ing chaps do as a matter of fact my
blood wasnt the least bit chilled about
enid walsh

  i met her in rather an odd way that
january evening-or rather she met me
for it was she who came and tapped on
my door i yelled come in thinking
one of the fellows had dropped by and
she came in

  she wore a trim little scarlet swagger-
ish suit that hugged tight to her absolutely
gorgeous body her eyes and lips were

vivid without being awfully made up and
she had a fluff of dark curly hair combed
over to one side-but it isnt any good try-
ing to describe enid just imagine your
particular brand of dream girl walking in
at your door and youll sense what i felt
this isnt mush any fellow thats never
had a dream girl notion in his head-well
i know what kind of flower he is

  i felt all this before she opened her lips
and when i heard her voice that clinched
it

  im afraid you dont know me mr
forture she said im miss walsh
next door

  i must have looked foolish just staring
at her probably i grinned like an idiot
because wouldnt it have been hell if
shed said mrs

  i dont quite know how to say this
she went on its embarrassing to ask
favors of strangers-

  oh im a small town boy i told her
always glad to oblige the folks next
door ill lend you the sugar bowl cup
of flour gin anything im handy at
running errands too

  she laughed

  its my radio she said there seems
to be a click in it a loud click one of
my girl friends is staying with me tonight
-she doesnt want to be alone on account
of the fiend and i could tell the scare
had got to her too i just wondered
would you mind terribly about lending us
your radio just for tonight mines a
rented set and ill have the man fix it
tomorrow

  i felt like a polar bear one of the rog-
ers park gang that takes a dip in the lake
once a week through the winter

  gosh i had to say mines on the
blink too been that way for a week its
one of those special -tubers and i
havent wanted anyone but an expert to go
over it-

  then ill have to ask somewhere else


dime mystery magazine

he said my friend and i have to prac-
tice a dance routine for the artists and
models benefit and closed the door

  i heard her heels clicking down the
hall so she was an artists model then
i knew whereid gotten the dream girl
idea-her face on magazine covers sure
i listened and fairly soon another fellow
brought her his radio he carried it into
her apartment and hooked it up i heard
him say down the hatch and knew
shed offered him a drink

  damn

a fter a while i went and tapped at
her door there was a pause then
she called whos there

  well girls werent opening their doors
-not that month i told her and she
came she had thrown on a negligee and
underneath i could just make out the
dance routine costume panties and a
brassiere

  please i said would you mind ask-
ing your radio man to look in at my set

  glad to she said and naturally
didnt invite me in or offer me a drink

  about  the next evening a man
stopped at my apartment and offered me
his card it said hugo thyle ra-
dios rented repaired satisfaction guaran-
teed and so forth he was an oldish
man and a big one and with the most
extraordinarily powerful hands id ever
seen

  you wont believe this but he didnt
use a tool of any kind on my set when it
came to taking out a screw-and they
were well-set screws-he simply put his
black thick sharpened fingernail into the
slotted head and turned i saw him snip
a wire clean through between the thumb
and forefinger nails

  its a pretty good radio i said dont
you think not that i wanted or needed
his opinion

  that his eyes which were light

green and shifty showered contempt on
the set thats a mere childs device
which got in my hair

  you dont see many better ones i
said

  oh commercially he grunted but
commercial radios in its infancy

  i thought i knew what he was getting
at i expect we will have practical tele-
vision one of these days theyll be bring-
ing prize-fights and football games right
into our homes i expect

  television it sounded like a snort
thats another childs toy radioll go a
long ways beyond that

  i dont know why my spine tingled it
must have been his manner-his perfect
cocksuredness

  well i said whats your guess
he chuckled softly and for the first
time looked straight at me well what
would you say to sitting down in front of
your radio and-instead of having the
prize-fight brought to you-you yourself
be taken to the prize-fight

  i was too stunned to say anything in
other words his words hammered at me
what would you say to ectoplasmic trans-
mission 

  say that in english i said

  the ectoplasm is the material manifes-
tation of the life-spirit principle he came
back

  you mean shoot souls out on radio
waves i got a laugh out of that oh
nuts

  thyle gave me a dirty look the queer
thing is i dont believe he was sore be-
cause i laughed at him he seemed to be
sore at himself-as if hed said too much
and wished now he hadnt said any-
thing   

tthe rest ill write carefully my object
is to put down exactly what happened
when im not sure about any part of it
ill say so for example i cant give tlie
locked in with death



 time to the minute but it was close to
 midnight   

   then hell broke loose i heard a yell
 from enid walshs apartment well it
 wasnt a yell either more of a muffled
 sob i should say that it started out to be
 i a yell and was smothered or throttled into
  hardly any sound at all i wouldnt have
 heard it except for the thinness of the
 wall between our rooms   

   my chest thickened inside when i heard
 that the breath made a dragging noise
 and feeling in my throat i couldnt be
 sure that i had heard it and at the same
 time i knew

   then a sound of feet running-or try-
 ing to run churning up and down in the
 same spot almost as if dragging some
 enormously heavy weight

    i came up out of the chair like a shot
 and got to the door and had to fumble
 with the knob before i stumbled out into
 the hall at the same instant enids door
 jerked open and i saw her

    she had on a different negligee a misty
 and billowy white silk thing with some
 kind of a fuzzy collar to it one sleeve
 had been torn out from the shoulder and
 showed the white curvedness of her arm
 down to the elbow the negligee was torn
 across the front too her hands clasped
 the tattered silk and covered her breasts

   what happened i said what-

   she couldnt possibly answer for a mo-
 ment or two her face was talc-white
 drained white the eyes made two wide
 circles and to me they were bottomless
 pools on which horror floated honest to
 god her eyes looked deathly

    enid swallowed or tried to

    its in here she managed to say the
 fiend-

   i went past her into the apartment no
 credit to me understand at that time i
 figured the fiend to be one of those dirty
 night prowlers maybe with some tricky
 wire device for unfastening windows as

the police said  i happened to be the
lucky one in the million decent chaps in
chicago aching to sink their fists into the
brute

  so i went in with the left and the right
cocked for action and then had to pull
up short  because there wasnt any-
body or anything to hit

  nothing

  and at the same time i had a feeling
there was something i could hear it
breathing  a horrible wet sucking
sound or was that the pound and seethe
of blood in my own skull because i
couldnt locate the source of it   

  understand the windows were down
and fastened down from the inside i
made sure of that two rooms opened off
the apartments hallway a kitchenette-
dinette and a living room with in-a-dor
and the bathroom beyond that

  i waded into the closet where enids
gowns hung and explored through the
misty perfumed things i poked behind
the in-a-dor and looked under the sofa
even into the gas range oven    and
there wasnt anything and at the same
time there was that feeling of a secret
lurking damnable presence

  its no use enid said she had
closed the door and stood leaning against
it you wont find it it just isnt-

  i stared at her but you said it was
in here

  i know her voice went dull re-
signed hopeless only the thing isnt
human not even real  if you can
see what i mean

t couldnt so i fumbled in my
pocket-i had on my smoking jacket
by the way-and found a cigarette she
didnt take one still that pale face and
too-wide eyes youd better tell me what
happened exactly i said

  im alone tonight enid explained
the noise of the lake outside bothered


dime mystery magazine

my friend-made her imagine things she
said shes staying with another friend
tonight

  she glanced at the sofa-didnt point
for her hands covered her breasts as ive
said i sat there listening to the radio
perhaps i dozed off a little-

  thats it i said you had a night-
mare of course i even thought to
myself that maybe she had torn her own
negligee before she snapped out of the
nightmare

  it wasnt a dream she shook her head
it-oh the horrid slimy thing it got
hold of me and dragged me down-tore at
me    and then somehow i twisted
away from it off the sofa onto the floor
i staggered away i dont know how-

  what did it look like i asked

  i dont know

  you mean the light was off i said
puzzled but the radio was on-

  thats on the power circuit she said
but the bridge lamp was burning i just
didnt see it clearly-something strange
and white or cloudy  if there was
anything to see oh i dont know

  it sounded more and more like a night-
mare to me still-shall i call the po-
lice i asked

  she bit her lip shaking her head the
police cant do-anything they never do
only id get my name and picture in the
papers and people would stare at me
strangers come up and ask questions-id
hate that

  i knew maybe theyd even call her one
of those cheap publicity seekers   

  look here miss welch i said you
can have my apartment-theres a bed-
room and ill sleep in the chair or ill
bunk in your dinette

  no-o

  well it wouldnt have been exactly
proper besides why should she trust
me 

  so i said anyway i sleep lightly if

you have any more trouble just call

  i lied i didnt sleep at all back in my
own apartment i took off my shoes and
lay back in the chair this chair faced the
door and furthermore i opened the door
a very little and propped it with a wad of
paper the idea being not to waste any
time fumbling with the knob again

  also i balanced a book on the back of
my hand-just in case i should doze
off

  pretty silly considering that the girl
had merely dreamed the thing yes but
i remembered that feeling of a something
being in there remembered it i felt it
now gibing at me  

phen  it was a full hour later

   i could hear enid walking about
there wasnt going to be any sleep for
either of us apparently and i heard the
radio playing in her living-room   
by and by it seemed to me that there was
something queer about that radio music
as if something more than music lived in
it a menace a queer pulsing evil
menace

  crazily i wanted to pound on her wall
and tell her to shut off that radio that it
wasnt right-somehow

  im having a nightmare too i de-
cided

  all the same i got up and went to my
own set a little time passed while the
tubes warmed and then i hurried dialing
down through the night-owl stations until
i got in on her wave-length

  i listened treasure island it was
but hadnt it a different cleaner sound
as it came from my radio  i felt sure of it

  then    there wasnt any yell this
time not even the whisper of a sob
only the sound of something wet rus-
tling if wetness can rustle a dreadful soft
squishy sound as youd imagine the feel-
ers of an octopus slithering over a sea
stone would make   
locked in with death



  and this sound seemed to be an inten-
sification of what id been hearing in her
radio

  i went through the door-down the hall
like a shot i knew that this time she
wouldnt get to her door i slammed down
the corridor close to the opposite wall and
whirled-smashed my shoulder against
her door

  they dont put solid oak doors in these
apartment buildings there was hardly
any sense of shock as i crashed through
the flimsy panel

  enid i choked

  she lay in the middle of the living room
floor in a pool of light shed by the bridge
lamp face down with her hands out in
front of her clutching the rug-as if shed
been trying to drag herself away from
something  all that remained of her
negligee was the fluff of fur around the
neck

  three bloody channels raked down over
her nude satiny back from just between
the shoulder blades to the swelling round-
ness of her hips as if shed been torn by
an enormous metal claw

  thank god she lived great breaths
lifted her shoulders

  i stared across the room and there
wasnt anything   

   nothing   

  except the radio purling out a louder
different dance melody   

  but this couldnt be a nightmare i
knew those scratches-wounds really
-couldnt have been self-inflicted there
had to be something

  and the dinette-dark didnt some-
thing move in there lord i couldnt be
sure if i didnt see it i sensed the thing
-its secret lurking damnable presence

  switch buttons ranged on a brass plate
along the apartment halls wall i poked
one   

  and killed the bridge lamp blackness
blotted out everything-except the radio

music flooding out around the yellow
blink of the illuminated dial

  then i saw it

a foul and vile shape was in that
room-and it seemed to flow out of
the radio

  the thing took form almost human-
and yet not human either  a faint
and dusky blot outlined by white vivid
phosphorescent tentacles or filaments
which waved and crawled in the air like
innumerable glowing worms

  hands it had hands  big sinister
shining hands with nails which gleamed
as fangs in the dark   

  there was blood on the hands  saw
that too shining red drops that wept
from the extended groping fingers

  i stood still and gaped at it-instead of
smashing out through the broken door
and that standing still was a hell of a lot
braver thing than all the charging and fist
shaking id done that night   

  maybe id have run after all but sud-
denly i couldnt because the thing rushed
me

  since im telling the truth i cant go
into detail about the rest i dont know
what happened exactly it was all horror
and madness-a blind hot seething mael-
strom of rage and fear inside me-and
that other cold slimy maelstrom outside
of me  

  the deadness of it like hammering
your fists into corpse flesh flaccid and
rotten and gelid it lived though it
oozed and slithered all over me sucked
me into its noxious folds

  there was a face in it deep in the
loathsome jelly substance the features
wavered like a countenance seen through
muddy water green eyes blazed a pale
slit of mouth laughed without making
any sound he didnt make a sound even
when my fists rammed deep into the flaccid
flesh


dime mystery magazine

  he yes-hugo thyle

  or else some unthinkably horrible rep-
lica of him made in some mucid stuff   
what had he said ectoplasm

  we flopped and threshed on the floor
his hands raked me they were noxious
poisoned-i got weak and lightheaded
my fists felt like pillows my arms went
limp

  he-or his ectoplasmic self-had me
pinned to the rug his weight flowed over
me concentrated its weight on my chest
and numbed biceps

  and the hands at my throat

  i should have died then there was
no way i could go on living-not stran-
gled lungs bursting head a ball of fire
but i didnt die though it-for it wasnt
human i knew that now-may have
thought i had

  i lurched up and went for the shape
again

  it got away from me there wasnt
anything i could get my hands on because
it seemed to be thinning and dissolving
there in front of the radio-disappearing
into it

  i smashed at it

  fire fountained and i heard a scream
-or the ghost of a scream-that cried out
in a more horrible torment than this earth
knows  the scream of a thing that
dies frightfully  the wail of life being
pulled fiber from fiber

  then the apartment lights flashed up
it seemed that half the occupants of the
building were crowding into the room
i glared at them stupidly i with my
hand thrust halfway through the ruined
smoking radio that had exploded when i
hit it   

  and no sign of the thing anywhere

come one had called the police they
came bursting into the place with a
big plainclothesman leading-detective
lieutenant clubb as i afterward learned

  they came damn near dragging me off
to jail as the fiend   

  but enid had gotten into the bathroom
and put on another wrap and she opened
a window in there and told them a story
about a ragged tramp breaking into the
apartment you see she couldnt have
saved me any other way figure it out
for yourself here were a bunch of cops
that had caught a man-bloody faced with
torn clothing-in a room where a girl had
been assaulted they were being ragged
to death by the newspapers those cops
do you suppose theyd have believed any
story about a fiend that vanished into a
portable radio

  i didnt say anything about hugo thyle
id been near enough to jail i wasnt
courting the lunatic asylum

  clubb quizzed us hard what did the
man look like we cant identify him
we agreed finally he noted the time of
the assault--and left

  i lay awake that night figuring on ways
to cope with hugo thyle i never did set-
tle with him in the morning paper was
a big front page story about the affair in
enids apartment and back on page  this
small item

       radio expert

           electrocuted

    hugo thyle  proprietor of a radio
  repair shop at  cottage grove was
  found electrocuted in his place of business
  early today mr thyle had been working
  over an experimental broadcasting device
  of a type so far unidentified and was killed
  by a short circuit in the wiring the time
  of the accident was indicated by his watch
  which stopped at a few seconds after 
  am this morning

     thyles body was badly injured by flying
  pieces of metal when the device exploded
  the entire upper portion of the trunk was
  found to be covered with contusions physi-
  cians said however that the electric current
  caused the death

    mr thyle was formerly employed by the
  zonocast radio corporation
locked in with death



  the same day i carefully examined the
interior of enids radio every tube in
the instrument was hopelessly wrecked i
have submitted the ruined tubes to experts
who tell me that they have never seen
anything of the type before

  mrs forture-yes enid-and i have
quietly gone around looking at apart-
ments-that is the apartments where the
fiend struck the queer thing is in the
dozen cases weve been able to follow up

the radios had been rented from thyle
and he had removed the sets after the
tragedy

 it is hard to believe in the transmis-
 sion of soul plasm over the radio waves

now enid comes and begs me not to
write any more about that old horror

 we will forget it she says

 and that is the right and sensible thing
 to do

y oeorge alden edson

author of hotel of the damned etc

thousands of volts of electricity swept through his quivering body-
and still he sat and hurled vows of vengeance at those whom he deemed
his persecutors    nan raymond and her fiance trembled but would
not believe-until they cowered in the shadow of the black doom he

brought back from hell

the city room relaxed after the
morning edition had been put
to bed a couple of the boys
yawned with much noise and gesticulation
morey the city editor stopped chewing
the stub of a dead cigar and puffed actual
smoke from a live one i lit a cigarette
myself then glancing at nan raymond


who is the only girl working as a straight
reporter on the daily examiner and the
only girl in the world so far as im con-
cerned i forced a grin and pushed to
my feet

  honey i said when id walked across
to the desk at which she sat lets go
make some large whoopee for a bit i
 a tensely
 dramatic
 novelette
 of eerie
 doom

fed the need of some strong stimulants

 i did feel the need of it-plenty i
havent got the stomach of guys like
harry kent at nine oclock that eve-
ning he and i had sat in the death house
at the prison watching myron zorn the
most fiendish criminal and murderer in
the history of the city burn in the elec-
tric chair now just a couple of hours
later harry was cracking jokes with an-
other reporter while i still felt sick as
hell

 and i knew nan didnt feel any too

chipper id loved her long enough to
spot her feelings almost at a glance she
had helped get the evidence which had
sent zorn to the chair and despite the
fact that he had deserved death for all
the atrocious crimes he had committed
she was upset




dime mystery magazine

   but she answered id rather go home
 bob somehow i couldnt do anything else
 tonight

   okay darling i told her ill go
 along with you lets start 

   say i guess you began to wonder if
 the old buzzard really wasnt going to ful-
 fill his prophecy morey who had saun-
 tered across the room to us laughed as
 nan reached for her hat

   i didnt laugh to me with the ghastly
 vision seared into my memory what had
 happened would never be funny zorn
 a misshapen hulk of flesh with a huge
 apish head had scorned assistance to walk
 the last mile entering the death cham-
 ber at the end he had sneered but sud-
 denly as he had taken his place in the
 chair an expression of insane fury had
  contorted his face

   cut out that damned drivel he had
 snarled at the chaplain who had been read-
 ing from his bible then he had swung
 venomous eyes over the stand in which
 reporters sat with the state witnesses
 fixing them on harry and me and said
 get this-for yourselves and the others
 on your snooping paper who helped send
 me here they cant kill me and ill
 see you all die in hellish agony before
 im satisfied

   had i known what i was destined to
 know the full horror those words would
 have affected me not knowing they
 hadnt i had merely thought them the
 words of a maniac but those that had
 followed or more particularly the cir-
 cumstances under which they had been
 uttered had made my blood freeze

   for the executioner had advanced at-
 tached the two electrodes to the head and
 leg of the convict who had already been
 strapped to the chair by guards stepped
 back to his instrument board to await the
 signal of the warden finally thrown the
 switch-and myron zorn had repeated
 his threats

af course the electricity had even-
 tually quieted him but for a mo-
ment with that awful hum accompanying
his voice and the nauseous stench of
burned flesh filling the chamber he had
actually resisted death more incredible
supposedly impossible he had even re-
mained conscious enough to talk   

  so remembering the horrible picture i
didnt laugh at moreys crude attempt to
be humorous i just said yes i did
begin to wonder   

  maybe hell return from the grave to
get us harry kent suggested approach-
ing and leaning on nans desk wonder
how he intended to kill us rather an
interesting speculation eh

  a brilliant newspaperman harry kent
possessed the clever brain to have been
great but he was erratic as he was bril-
liant sometimes convivial sometimes
moody always sardonic now however
i thought i could detect a forced note in
his mockery

  he didnt strike me as a sweet soul
whod forget the agony he promised us
kent continued perhaps hed-

  i-i wonder if he meant me too a
new voice said nervously

  i glanced over my shoulder and saw
that gramp hodge had edged up behind
me the gramp was a nickname based
not so much on age for hodge wasnt
fifty as on manner he was a crochety
bird who appeared with both raincoat and
rubbers if one white cloud hung in the
sky strangely though he was the best
rewrite man in the office i gathered that
he had grown jittery because he had writ-
ten several of the stories about zorn

  i didnt really help send him to the
electric chair the apologetic whine in
his voice made me wonder if he thought
zorn could hear him i-i only wrote
what you boys told me over the tele-
phone

  sure as hell hell go for you first
convicts from hell



morey the city editor told him then
with a raucous hoot but ill lay a
hundred to one that even a ghost would
get lost in the dust youd make

  you can laugh hodge shrilled in
quick anger almost immediately how-
ever fear swept back through the gleam
of rage which had snapped into his wa-
tery eyes he glanced at harry at nan
finally fixed his gaze on me his voice
quivered with awe as he said ive writ-
ten hundreds of stories about executions
no man ever before talked after the exe-
cutioner had thrown the switch no or-
dinary human being could talk    how
-how do you explain what happened to-
night 

  maybe zorn wasnt human mur-
mured harry kent

  i had chanced to lower my gaze to nan
i stiffened for deep in her blue eyes
lurked something which wasnt just
squeamishness caused by the thought
that she had helped send a man to the
chair-but fear

  i reached for her arm said lets go
honey

  she picked up her handbag rose morey
and kent rode down in the elevator with
us

  old gramp sure is a pip morey
muttered chuckling say hell be petri-
fied by the time he gets home

  and i kent announced with his
sardonic smirk will be petrified long be-
fore i get home gnight children ill
see you anon

  he weaved down the street as morey
gave a disgusted snort and ducked into
the subway   

tvtan and i decided to walk to her
 apartment for a while she chat-
tered lightly about events of no impor-
tance i waited and before long as id
expected she swung to what was on her
mind

  i-i dont see how he could have kept
repeating his threats of vengeance while
-while the electricity    she shud-
dered

  i suppose some short in the wires
mightve lowered the voltage of the cur-
rent i told her or perhaps he did
have a physical peculiarity which made it
less effective at first maybe he knew
about this peculiarity and was screwy
enough to believe he wouldnt die   
but what difference he did

  i know nan murmured yet ive
had the wierdest feeling ever since the
execution bob a feeling that-well just
that he isnt-dead

  but of course he is i argued and i
remembered the hideous sight of myron
zorns misshapen body leaping against
the straps straining finally going limp
when the current was cut i swallowed
hard yet my voice was hoarse when i
added i saw him die afterwards the
prison doctor examined him and pro-
nounced him dead they put his corpse in
a coffiin that was taken away in a hearse
for burial by his brother

  oh bob nan exclaimed with a con-
trite glance i didnt mean to make you
remember lets talk about something
else

  we didnt though because i kept ar-
guing until i had smothered her feeling
with logic she was herself again a girl
packing more vivaciousness than any girl
i know when we reached her apartment
i stayed a few minutes put in a word
about our glowing plans for the future
when i could then kissed her and left

  i started the hike toward my apartment
in the lower end of town the short cut
which i always took when i walked led
me through a dark residential district
having temporarily forgotten the horror
of the execution in thoughts of the girl i
loved i hummed happily-until i heard
the scream


dime mystery magazine

  it was a womans scream high and
shrill a shriek of mortal terror i jolted
to an abrupt halt almost immediately a
second scream followed the first this
one held both terror and pain

  shaking off the startled numbness which
had grioped me i dashed toward the cor-
ner the second outcry faded to a
choked groan of agony i reached the
corner and wheeled into the side street
a woman face bloody and clothes torn
lay sprawled on the pavement beyond
her running swiftly away from the spot
i glimpsed a hunched figure i raced in
pursuit

  he led me across lawns through mazes
of trees and shrubbery around houses
trying to lose me in the darkness i man-
aged to hold the same distance between us
but i couldnt gain

  though he kept twisting his head peer-
ing back at me i couldnt seem to pene-
trate the gloom to see his face    then
i did he had skirted a street lamp
slowed before plunging into an alley be-
tween two apartment buildings cast a
quick glance over one shoulder

  face-god i felt my whole body go
cold even while i ran it was a ghastly
mask of shriveled red skin

  yet the hideousness of the face wasnt
what made me gasp something else
something vague but present caused the
shocked sound to tear from my throat

  for the first time i saw that the crea-
tures head was hairless and then i re-
alized that his features bore a resemblance
to those of myron zorn

rphe possible significance of this re-
semblance drove horror-horror and
yes stark fear-to the very depths of my
soul yet i didnt stop i forced myself
to keep rushing toward him and when
he twisted his head plunged into the alley
reason asserted itself in my brain

  myron zorn was dead    that this

creatures head had been hairless like the
shaven head of a convict prepared for the
chair and his skin shriveled like skin
which has been terribly burned didnt
prove anything nor did the resemblance
and perhaps i had even imagined it my-
ron zorn was dead   

  i had reached the mouth of the alley
thick blackness shut down on me with
the next step for a short distance i
groped my way then halted and stiffened
a clammy chill oozed over me

  from far ahead a mocking laugh had
floated back to my ears   

  after a moment i turned to grope my
way out of the alley again reason had
killed my fear that wasnt why i quit
the chase i just realized the uselessness
of it the creature had given me the slip
-and a woman needing aid if she wasnt
dead lay back there on the side street

  she wasnt dead a few people who
had heard her screams including a cop
had gathered two of them were start-
ing to carry her into the nearest house i
trailed along with the others

  she recovered consciousness in the
house she wasnt badly hurt just
scratched and terrified her story which
she told in a shaky voice was that a de-
generate had jumped at her from the
bushes as she was walking home she
tried to describe him

  the policeman and the others obviously
thought her description exaggerated until
without referring to my momentary im-
pression that the creature had resembled
myron zorn i told my story

  mustve been burned in a fire the
cop grunted the bums probably drove
him nuts

  the others agreed   

  a few minutes later after the cop had
telephoned the description to police head-
quarters i borrowed the phone the
woman it seemed was the wife of a local
politician names make news the yam
convicts from hell



was worth more than a stick on the third
page

  i gave the facts to the rewrite on the
night trick at the office finishing i made
sure he had everything and started to
hang up but the rewrite caught me in
an excited tone he told me he too had
some news

  and he did-news which caused cold
sweat to ooze from my pores

  ared zorn myron zorns brother had
claimed the corpse after the execution and
tarried it away in a hearse for burial
there had been a driver and himself just
a short while ago he had appeared at a
farmhouse on the lonely road from the
prison to the city bruised and disheveled
and frantically called the police he had
told them when they arrived that the
hearse had gone over a bank he had
been knocked unconscious later recov-
ering he had seen that the coffin was on
the ground near him instead of in the
hearse-open and empty

chapter two
the man with the burned head

t got to the office very early the next
morning from morey i learned that
the night city editor had sent leg men to
check on the acident they had reported
that the police hadnt found any clues as
to what had become of the corpse

  the driver of the hearse was in such
tough shape that he couldnt explain what
had caused the accident morey told me
neither can zorn    the old man
wants us to play up the stuff myron zorn
jabbered about how he wouldnt die an
expression of disgust swept over moreys
face to give the yam a little of the
spooky stuff make a hell of a lot out
of the fact that zorn didnt fry like a
prime cut    nuts

  the old man as we called the recent

owner of the daily examiner loved sen-
sationalism

  well i suppose hes the boss morey
sighed but sometimes he gives me a
pain in the kohunkus  you amble out
to ared zorns and see if hes more co-
herent about things after a snooze bob
then go to the clarke memorial hospi-
tal and quiz the guy who drove the hearse
his name is dennis

  okay i said

  suddenly morey laughed exclaimed
say ive got it-hodge how hes go-
ing to quake when he hears about the
corpse disappearing hell get the old
mans spooky stuff into the yarn without
trying    here he comes

  i looked toward the door and there
was hodge umbrella on his arm shuffling
into the office his haggard face and his
bloodshot eyes told of a sleepless night-
and i couldnt help a little feeling of pity
for the poor cuss

  he wasnt three steps inside the door
before harry kent started to give him
the new development i didnt listen long
however for i saw that nan had arrived
while id been talking with morey she
looked pale frightened i went over to
her desk

  hello honey i said with a grin which
was supposed to make things look less
ominous to her

  but it didnt work staring at me with
anxious eyes she quavered i met wal-
ter keller in the hall he told me all
about whats happened  oh bob the
-the feeling i had last night was stronger
this morning even before i heard and
now    

  you mustnt let your nerves get you
darling i said in an insistent voice
somebody stole the corpse it was a
corpse you know that and corpses
dont come to life

  i-i know nan mumbled i just
cant help-


dime mystery magazine

  what do you think happened to the
body lake a voice asked

  i glanced over one shoulder to see wal-
ter keller sidle up to us he was the old
mans nephew a thin chap with sallow
cheeks and receding chin who had begun
as a cub reporter to learn the racket be-
cause he figured hed inherit the paper at
the old mans death

  i think it was stolen i grunted curt-
ly i was sore because hed been the one
to tell nan that zorns corpse had van-
ished from its coffin-unreasonably of
course since someone else would have
told her if he hadnt but like the other
boys i guess i even resented kellers ex-
istence  he was too much of a parasite

  who would have stolen it he coun-
tered a superior expression crept over
his face electricity is a strange force
i happen to know more about it than the
rest of you in this office ive studied it

	  and the related psychic forces now
i have a theory that myron zorn actu-
ally has-

  bunk i snapped neither of us
are interested

  with a sullen frown keller slouched
away   

  listen kid i continued to nan
dont let dopes like him feed you any
screwy theories that feeling of yours
comes from being upset because you dug
up some of the evidence used to send zorn
to the chair but you dont need to be
upset he was a rat who deserved to die
just remember the helpless women he tor-
tured to death

  nan shuddered

  ive got to go have a chat with ared
zorn i told her keep a stiff upper
lip honey    see you soon

t eaving the office i jumped into a
 cab ared zorn a bachelor who had
once been a professor at the university
and had retired to do private research

work lived on the outskirts of the city i
gave the driver the address and lit myself
a cigarette

  the question walter keller had asked
had been sticking in my crop ever since
id had the news from the rewrite over
the phone last night who would have
stolen that corpse i couldnt think of
anybody yet obviously the corpse had
been stolen nothing else could have hap-
pened

  for a few minutes after hearing the
news however i hadnt been so sure
nothing else had happened the fact that
the hideous hairless creature had seemed
to resemble myron zorn had been less
easy to forget with zorns body actually
gone from its coffin in the end though
i had managed to make my reason stifle
the wild ideas in my head  

  within ten minutes we reached ared
zorns house it was a gloomy old place
set far back from the street surrounded
by trees and unkempt shrubbery i told
the cabby to wait went up the walk
knocked

  an old crone with a wrinkled parch-
ment face opened the door she gave me
a hostilely questioning stare

  im robert lake of the daily ex-
aminer i said with a cheery smile id
like to see mr zorn

  she said humph

  but she told me to wait closed the door
and eventually reappeared as if doing
anything for me caused her acute agony
she motioned me into a musty hall and led
me to a mustier room at the end

  ared zorn sat in a stiff chair behind a
desk littered with books and papers un-
like his monstrous brother he was rather
a fine looking man he had a thin ascetic
face studious grey eyes grey hair

  good morning i said in the tone i
reserve for people from whom i want to
get something to print i hope that
convicts from hell



youre recovering after your unfortunate
accident

  he nodded but offered no comment
we thought you might possibly re-
member more about the accident this
morning i continued i mean about the
cause

  he shook his head muttered no i
wasnt watching the road as we went down
that hill suddenly we skidded- he gave
a little shudder-and then there was a
terrible crash i felt myself being hurled
from the seat    thats all i remember
you regained consciousness to find
your brothers coffin on the ground near
you-open and empty i said i made my
voice casual do you have any idea what
might have happened to the body

  do i-have any-idea he repeated
my words in a hoarse whisper then
quickly nervously no-no i dont

  i waited a moment before i asked do
you recollect that your brother had any
physical peculiarity which might have
have made him partially impervious to
electrical shocks

  ared zorn stared at me a puzzled ex-
pression on his face but back in his grey
eyes i thought i could detect a furtive
look he ran his tongue over dry lips

  no i dont recollect any such peculi-
arity he said shifting in his chair

  i waited another moment before still
very casually i murmured youve gone
deeply into electricity with your psychi-
cal researches havent you

  only a-a little ared zorn mumbled
do you think such a peculiarity pos-
sible

  i-i couldnt say he raised one
shaky hand swathed in bandages and
pressed the fingers along his forehead
im afraid you must excuse me now i
-i feel too faint to talk

  of course i told him solicitously
thank you for seeing me at all

   i went to the door and as i stepped into

the hall cast one quick glance over my
shoulder his eyes were fixed on me   

t tshered out by the sullen house-
keeper i returned to my waiting cab
and ordered the driver to take me to the
clarke memorial hospital during the
trip i thought about the brief interview
with ared zorn

  obviously he had hedged on the ques-
tions concerning electricity they had
seemed to put him on his guard against
admitting something i wondered what
and i wondered why he had been so
nervous when i had asked him if he had
any idea what had become of the corpse
of his brother i suspected he did have
an idea   

  arriving at the hospital i went into the
reception room and asked about the man
who had driven the hearse he was too
badly injured to talk any more the nurse
told me so i rode back to the office

  i looked for nan couldnt find her-
and then morey shouted to me

  get over to the cramer mansion he
ordered cradling the receiver of one of
the battery of phones on his desk the
caretaker just called the police his wife
was murdered last night he claims he
was bound and couldnt get free until
morning    god this ought to please
the old man

  the cramer mansion was one of those
brownstone atrocities built in the nineties
i argued my way past the cop on guard
at the door pushed into the hall and fol-
lowed the sound of voices into a big room
to the right

  inspector murphy grunted at sight of
me he and two other plainclothes men
were grouped around a quivering old guy
with an ashen face and anguished eyes

  then i felt the inside of me go hollow

  the woman lay on the floor near one
corner she had been strangled to death
her face framed by disheveled grey hair


dime mystery magazine

was bloated and blue her glazed eyes
bulged from their sockets

  i-i tell you i didnt do it the old
guy shrilled the protestation in an hys-
terical voice you must believe me i
didnt one of them did it    they
jumped on me when i came into the room
they bound me and gagged me theres
the rope the gag he pointed to some
rope and a wad of cloth on the floor
they opened the safe and took every-
thing-all the jewels then she-my wife
-came downstairs looking for me and
 oh god

  for a moment the poor old devil shook
with sobs but finally he managed to
continue

  one of them strangled her before she
could utter a single cry strangled her
to death    right here in front of me
and do you still insist they looked
like corpses inspector murphy grunted
in a sarcastic voice

  two of them zvere corpses i could
smell the stench of the grave on them
and their faccs    god they were hor-
rible     the third-the fiend who mur-
dered my wife-was a monster with a
hairless head and a ghastly face that
looked as if it had been burned

  jerking taut i pushed toward the care-
taker

  a face that looked as if it had been
burned i echoed what time did this
happen 

  about three oclock sir he quavered
i heard some noises and came to investi-
gate the cramers had all gone away on
a trip and left part of the family jewelry
in the safe the servants were on vaca-
tions    just about three oclock but
i couldnt get loose to call the police until
this morning

   i think hes telling the truth murphy
i said to the inspector this monster
with the burned face must be the degen-
erate who assaulted that woman about

twelve oclock last night i chased him
and saw him the description fits per-
fectly

  say it does murphy exclaimed
id forgotten about him maybe youre
right and the story is the truth sud-
denly he frowned but the two who
looked like corpses what the hell are
they

  i dont know i muttered unsteadily

  i tightened my lips the monster who
had so fiendishly strangled this poor old
woman must be the hideous creature i had
chased-the creature who had resembled
myron zorn between midnight and three
oclock he had acquired two accomplices
who looked like living corpses   

  good god what hellish horror stalked
the city

touring the whole trip back to the of-
fice i drove my reason at the nameless
dread within me again i told myself that
the creatures uncanny resemblance to my-
ron zorn meant nothing great heaven
it couldnt and of course the other two
the caretaker had claimed were corpses
werent corpses that was equally impos-
sible

  but what the devil was the gag    and
why

  reaching the office i found morey hav-
ing himself a private laugh over some-
thing he called to me i glanced at nans
desk saw she wasnt there and went over
to the city desk

  this is rich morey told me gramp
hodge and dear nephew walter have
been working on the old man first gramp
feeds him on how myron zorn mustve
been superhuman to have talked after
they poured the juice into him then
keller feeds him a few crazy theories on
how electricity controls life and death
between em theyve got the old man be-
lieving that zorn either didnt really die
convicts from hell



or has returned from the dead    and
is he scared

  morey had another laugh then wiped
his eyes and asked me what id got i
told him-still withholding the fact that
id thought the degenerate resembled my-
ron zorn

  but such a fantastic story was on the
books it seemed without any help from
me

  the old man on the strength of his
nephews fantastic electrical theories al-
ready figures zorn has cheated the grave
and is committing every crime in the
city morey said then he frowned
say this one could give a guy the creeps
if he let his imagination play with it a
fiendish killer with a hairless head and a
burned face    and two henchmen the
caretaker swears were walking corpses
that could give a guy the creeps couldnt
it

  it could i murmured

  and suddenly for just a moment an
uncertain gleam penetrated the hardness
of moreys eyes then he snorted as if
disgusted at himself

  did you get anything from ared zorn
or the driver of the hearse  he demanded

  i told about my interview with ared
zorn

  well you better see the old man be-
fore you write your yams morey said
after id finished he wants to have fin-
ger in every angle of this case youll
probably find him mumbling prayers in
his beard

  anybody in his office now i asked

  i dont know i never know since he
had that second door cut through into the
back hall hodge went out to get a pre-
scription for his nerves keller finally
started off on his morning assignment
and half under his breath morey grum-
bled swell fun to have the owners
nephew for a cub   

	i went across the door of the old mans

private office and knocked there wasnt
any answer i knocked again louder be-
cause the old man is deaf still no an-
swer-and i pushed the door open

  the ghastly sight which met my gaze
made every muscle in my body snap as
stiff as a steel rod the blood in my
veins congealed horror rocked my
senses

  for the old man his face purple and
eyes glassy sat slumped low against the
back of his desk chair-strangled to death

chapter three

discovery in the cemetery

touring the rest of that day that night
and the next day the horror i had
felt increased a hundredfold and spread
throughout the city for crime after crime
usually a robbery with someone murdered
and yet someone else left alive to tell the
tale was committed and always the
someone else left alive told a gruesome
tale of a monster with a hairless head
burned face and two accomplices who
looked like living corpses

  the murder of the owner of the daily
examiner coupled with the fact that my-
ron zorns body had disappeared from its
coffin when the hearse had been wrecked
convinced people the monster was zorn
the inability of the police to find clues
pointing to any other murderer was even
further proof either still alive or re-
turned from the dead zorn had risen from
his coffin and begun to carry out the
threats he had uttered in the death cham-
ber

  tonight the second night after the old
mans murder stark terror gripped the
city since dark the streets had been
nearly deserted those few forced to be
abroad their eyes wide with fear clung
to patches of light

of course we whom zorn had treat-
u

dime mystery magazine

ened they muttered to each other were
doomed that was certain but that wasnt
all no one else was safe   

   at about eleven oclock as usual we
 put the paper to bed newspapers cant
 just die with their owners besides the
 daily examiner already had a new owner
 -the old mans nephew walter keller

   his expectations had proved to be
 sound he had been the old mans sole
 beneficiary now his sallow face flushed
 with excitement he stood beside morey
 at the city desk

   this first article of mine will send the
 circulation soaring he gloated ive ad-
 vanced the theory that some of the mys-
 terious forces of electricity are really psy-
 chic forces therefore a man killed by
 electricity doesnt die as other men die
 his mind still possesses extraordinary
 psychic powers-powers which indubita-
 bly allow him to raise his physical corpse
 from the grave

   morey glowered

   and ive advanced the theory that
 myron zorn has returned from the grave
 he died-yes-but not as other men die
    scientists in this country will send
 my article all over the world to contempo-
 rary scientists the flush in kellers
 cheeks grew brighter now im having
 my chance to make all my theories on the
 relation of electricity to the psychic world
 heard

   you sound glad your uncle was killed
 j morey muttered

   no-no im very sorry keller pro-
  tested quickly but this phenomenon has
 j given me an oportunity to  

 i i didnt listen any longer though not
 even able to muster a smile for her i
 dragged myself wearily over to nans
 desk she sat there her pretty face pale
 and drawn still intent on that conceited
 fools ranting

   please dont be bothered by the bunk
 he spouts t begged hes crazy

  i-i wonder nan husked then she
lifted fearful eyes the prison doctor
swears myron zorn was dead when he
examined him yet who can this man
with the burned face be except myron
zorn  who else would commit such
brutal murders who else would have
killed mr keller

  i dont know i answered frankly
but i do know the fiend cant be zorn
i saw zorn die the prison doctor swears
he did die that means hes still dead
yet three people hes tortured and left
alive have recognized him nan qua-
vered and those two corpses    
theyve both been recognized as zorns
two henchmen who were electrocuted last
month and why would they have tor-
tured the man who sent them to the elec-
tric chair if they hadnt been the ones
who wanted revenge

  earlier in the evening a man who had
been instrumental in sending myron
zorns two henchmen to the chair had
been assaulted but instead of being killed
he had been horribly tortured and left
alive to suffer he had claimed that he
had recognized the faces of his torturers
the police however had held that terror
inspired by newspaper stories had made
him imagine he recognized them   

  i dont know i muttered again

  god if only i did know ever sine
the old man had been murdered with th
exception of two hours sleep which sheer
exhaustion had demanded i had sought
for some way to smash the horror grip-
ping the city-sought in vain if only i
could get a lead

  i wonder whose turns next a sar-
donic voice said

  harry kent had appeared from some-
where he draped one leg over the comer
of nans desk

  lets see he continued therere five
of us left in the top flight of workers on
this rag who helped push zorn so rudely
convicts from hell



into the hot squat nan you me morey
and hodge i wonder which will-

  stow it kent i snapped

  but i-

  god a young reporter burst into
the city room i-something-something
terrible- he choked

  come on come on whats the mat-
ter morey bellowed

  in the vacant lot back of the building
-i just found-gramp hodge the
young reporter swallowed hes been-
strangled to death

  and now kent murmured softly
there are only four of us    

tvtan uttered a little whimper swayed
to her feet clutched my arm a hard
groan rattled from my own throat hide-
ous thoughts streamed through my brain
this tragedy the horror of it added to
the horror of the last two days rocked
the reason to which i had clung so des-
perately

  first the old man-and now hodge
good god the fiend was carrying out the
threat myron zorn had made in the death
chamber but that didnt really prove
anything  i tried to pin myself to
logic the fiend couldnt be zorn-
couldnt

  yet the dreadful uncertainty in my
mind wouldnt be stifled he looked like
zorn other people beside myself had
noticed the resemblance and a person
who should know had sworn that the two
accomplices were zorns two henchmen
who had been electrocuted last month

  and now there are only four of us

  harry kents words kept pounding
through the back of my head only four
of us kent morey myself-and nan
and nan might be next my whole body
trembled

  morey kent keller and most of the
others who had been in the office crowded

toward the door morbid curiosity had
conquered the revulsion they knew the
sight of poor hodge would cause

  realizing there was no use in trying to
catch this fiend by chasing wildly around
the city i stayed with nan

  bob     her voice was hoarse
hes the second the-the murderer is
myron zorn    returned from the grave
for his revenge

  you mustnt believe that i whispered
i swung one arm around her and drew
her close to me its impossible-utterly
impossible

  if only i could believe beyond any
doubt what i was attempting to make her
believe    

  she clung to me her eyes wide and
terrified her face even paler

  i had to do something i had to get
this monster before he could kill nan
kill the girl i loved-god at the thought
my heart congealed into a cold weight of
fear in my breast but what could i do
i didnt know what i was hunting-a
man or a thing   

  morey had returned to the city room
he muttered id better call the police
though i dont suppose theyll be able
to do any more this time than-

  morey i interrupted leaving nan
and meeting him at his desk ive got to
be gone a little while will you guard
nan until i come back again

 why - sure morey answered
wherere you-

  i cant tell you i said it may not
mean anything at all    will you keep
her in your sight every minute

  sure bob sure he promised

  i crossed to nan and told her to stick
to morey she too wanted to know where
i was going i repeated what i had an-
swered morey

  but something may happen to you
sudden panic swept into her voice she


dime mystery magazine

grabbed my elbow the fiend may-

  dont worry honey i said gruffly
then i pulled away from her and hur-
ried down to the door

hphere wasnt even a cab in front of
  the office i had to go two blocks be-
fore i found one parked in the bright light
of a street lamp the drivers face was
pinched with fear

  brooklawn cemetery i ordered

  he stiffened in his seat

  come on-lets get going i said

  reluctantly he kicked his starter
meshed the gears wheeled out from the
curb i lit a cigarette and dragged in a
couple of nervous puffs of smoke

  i had to know who was executing my-
ron zorns threats it couldnt be zorn
logic told me it couldnt    but i had
to be convinced beyond the power of mere
logic

  i had to have actual proof

  in about fifteen minutes we reached
the nearest comer of the cemetery i had
the driver take me along to the main gate
and the caretakers lodge

  wait for me i commanded as i
stepped to the ground

  i left him while he was still whining a
frightened protest walked up to the door
of the lodge knocked after a few mo-
ments a wizened old man inched the door
open

  im a detective from headquarters i
lied i didnt want to waste time on argu-
ment about what i wished him to do for
me ive got orders to inspect the jorret
family tomb    heres a ten to pay you
for the trouble of coming to unlock it

  terror had snapped into the old mans
rheumy eyes at the mention of the name
jorret but avarice crawled through the
terror when he caught sight of money a
gnarled hand seized the bill

  come this way he gestured for me

to enter ill get the key and a light
turning he hunched out of the room
presently he returned with a lantern mo-
tioned for me to follow led me through
to a door giving directly into the cemetery
from the rear of the house we started
along a walk between lines of ghostly
white headstones

  arthur jorret one of myron zorns
two henchmen who had been electrocuted
last month had come from a good family
he had been a kid of twenty when he had
fallen under the insidious influence of
zorn last month when he had been exe-
cuted at the age of only twenty-five for
the vicious murder of a young girl his
family had won a bitter fight with the au-
thorities of this cemetery over their right
to put his body in the old family vault   

  heres the tomb ye want the care-
taker croaked then fearfully ye-ye
dont think yere going to find anything
wrong ye dont think them stories in
the newspapers is true

  i dont know i muttered grimly
has anybody visited this tomb within
the past three days

  not-not to my knowledge the care-
taker answered

  does anyone else have a key

  he shook his head

  i drew in a slow breath said okay
lets have a look

  he fumbled in his coat pocket produced
a bunch of keys on a ring held them close
to the lantern separating one with a
shaky hand he pushed it into the lock he
raised the lantern as he turned it i could
see the muscles in his wizened face twitch

  my own face was set the skin felt
tight the inside of me had gone hollow
a clammy chill of dread because of what
we might find crawled up my spine

  presently withdrawing the key the
caretaker pulled at the huge iron door it
creaked open dank air filled with a nau-
seous odor swirled out of the tomb
convicts from hell



  i-i aint going in there the care-
taker rasped ye can have the lantern
wheres arthur jorrets coffin i
asked

the-the bottom one on the right
taking the lantern i stepped into the
tomb and turned to the right the bottom
coffin my eyes flicked down the tier
that one there   

  i froze breath oozed between my lips
with a hissing sound my left hand which
held the lantern trembled and made the
light flicker

  for the cover of that bottom coffin had
been removed-and it was empty

chapter four

death in false-face

t hardly remember stumbling from
that tomb the ghastly significance of
the empty coffin had driven the capability
of clear thought from my brain as if i
had dreamed the actions i dimly recol-
lect locking the door of the tomb for the
terrified caretaker and hurrying with him
down to his lodge i recollect that he
begged me to take him to the city and
that i assented

  during the ride my mind whirled with
horror i had come to the cemetery to
prove that because arthm jorrets body
was in its coffin one of the supposedly
resurrected corpses was a fake that
would mean that the other supposed corpse
and the creature who resembled myron
zorn were also fakes

  but now    

  faster-faster i shouted to the dri-
ver of the cab

  i sat tense on the edge of the seat the
thing i had believed impossible might be
true kellers theories which i had con-
sidered so ridiculous might be correct
   how was i going to protect nan
how could i guard her from a creature

with power to bring not only himself but
others back to life

  despair clutched my heart

  yet i must i clenched my fists some-
how i must-and would

  now we had reached the center of the
city there was little traffic we careened
down the main street and jolted to a stop
in front of the office

  i jumped out to the sidewalk the old
caretaker of the cemetery following me
then i heard brakes scream and a hoarse
voice shout my name i wheeled to see a
burly form lurch from a second cab

  morey and he was alonel

  wheres nan t shouted at him

  i took her to- he choked

  suddenly i noticed that his shirt front
was drenched with blood he started to
sag i sprang toward him and caught him
i saw that his eyes which were usually
so hard and cynical were glassy with
horror

  god morey    tell me whats hap-
pened to her i said huskily

  i-i thought she wasnt safe in the
office after the others left he muttered
unsteadily i knew she wouldnt be safe
either at her home or mine the killer
was after both of us so i took her to
a friends house the-the friend wasnt
there we went around to try to fhtd a
window unlocked and-and- his voice
cracked then  it is zorn i saw him
he glided out of the darkness and stabbed
me he mustve taken nan i came to
   and she was gone

  those last words almost destroyed the
final vestige of sanity in my mind the
fiend had nan i had left her-and he
had struck an agonized groan tore from
my throat

  but he hadnt killed her i seized at
that tiny hope he would have done it
on the spot no he must have taken her
somewhere he must have wanted to use
her to satisfy his    desperately i stifled


dime mystery magazine

the hideous thought of his reason for let-
ting her live thinking about that would
drive me completely insane and i must
keep my head

  where would he have taken her who
might know i could think of just one
possible person-ared zorn i rushed
back to my cab and shouted ared zorns
address to the driver

  after a ride which seemed intermina-
ble we reached the gloomy house on the
outskirts of the city again i ordered my
driver to wait for me i ran up the path

  all the windows in the front were
black i rang the bell no answer i tried
the door to my surprise i found it un-
locked i flung it open

  the hall inside was dark but dim light
filtered through the doorway from the
room in which i had interviewed ared
zorn a couple of days ago

  zorn i shouted hurrying toward it

  the sound of my voice echoed through
the house and faded into silence there
was no response i reached the doorway
-and stopped short

  ared zorn sat in the stiff chair behind
his littered desk he stared at me with
sightless eyes he was dead his blue
face told the story like the others he
had been strangled

  i uttered a low moan of despair the
only one who might have told me where
to find the girl i loved-dead dear god
how could i ever find her now

  if the creature really were myron zorn
if he had the power to return from the
grave how could i ever have hoped to
save nan if a ghastly hoax were being
perpetrated  i stiffened in this mo-
ment of deepest despair my brai began
to work yes it was possible that the
whole business had been a fiendish hoax
cold sweat oozed from my pores

  all other angles could have been faked
and myron zorns ability to live after
the executioner had thrown the switch

 a person who knew a little about elec-
tricity could have managed even that

  god why hadnt i thought of this long
ago

  twisting about i rushed out of the
house and down to my cab i shouted
an address to the driver   

the address was a dilapidated ware-
house down near the waterfront but
on the roof of the unused building i
knew from several visits there in the past
was a bizarre penthouse it was reached
by stairs from a door part way up the
alley at ne side of the building

  i told the driver to stop at the nearest
corner i didnt want to advertise my ar-
rival leaping out before the cab had
even come to a complete stop i ran down
the street and ducked into the alley

  just how i was going to get inside the
building i didnt know the door of
course would be locked but perhaps i
could find a window   

  then before i had taken more than a
dozen steps up the alley it happened

  i didnt hear any sound i just saw
the hideous white face appear out of the
darkness to my right i tried to wheel
and swing a fist something crashed
down on my head i felt my legs buckle

  for a few moments i managed to cling
to consciousness vaguely though my
flaccid muscles refused to obey commands
to resist i realized that a second figure
with a white face had appeared and that
the two of them were lifting me they
carried me into the building but instead
of taking me up toward the penthouse
they carried me down some stairs into a
dank cellar

  then i passed out   

  i opened my eyes to a scene which
made horror grip my whole being i
was lying on the floor of a dimly lighted
little chamber filled with the nauseous
odor of rotted flesh near me stood two
convicts from hell



creatures whose faces were partially de-
composed

  god they must be living corpses and
one of them-i felt my sanity slip again
-did have the recognizable features of
arthur jorret

  yet that wasnt the full extent of the
horror i heard a voice husk my name
twisting my head i uttered a stricken
cry

  for in another part of the chamber a
dull black suit hanging from his hunched
form stood the hairless monster whose
shriveled red face resembled the face of
myron zorn and on the floor by his
feet half her clothes stripped from her
body lay nan

  bob    anguish showed through
the terror in her eyes oh god    now
hes got you

  the sight of her lying there half
naked with that hellish monster standing
over her made insane fury surge up
within me frenziedly i tried to leap to
my feet only then did i realize my
wrists and ankles were bound i strained
at the bonds

  i decided not to kill you-yet the
monster said in a rasping voice he
chuckled of course i shall kill you
the threats must be carried out but
first i wanted to give you the pleasure of
watching a little drama since you so un-
fortunately happened to be in this vicin-
ity    youve noticed that i also spared
the dear lady shes too beautiful to die
before i have the joy of-

  you damned fiend i raged

  the monster chuckled again mocking-
ly nodded to his two gruesome hench-
man and rasped i dont need you here
do the job we planned without me

  silently they shuffled out of the cham-
ber

  now the monster croaked bending
toward nan the little drama can be-
gin----

i went through the lowest hell of

  torture during the moments that fol-
lowed nan moaning in horror tried to
cringe away from the monsters foul
hands but she too was bound she
couldnt escape them his chuckles low-
ering to obscenely lascivious sounds he
ripped at the rest of her clothes

  i kept tugging frantically at my bonds
the rope around my wrists slashed
through the skin and let warm blood
trickle down over my hands but i was
numb to pain

  god i had to get free that monstrous
fiend couldnt have nan i had to save
her

  the rope around my wrists seemed to
have loosened a little if only i had more
time but in a few instants it would be
too late   

  suddenly a desperate idea flashed into
my mind i was near a jutting corner of
stone wall perhaps i could use that for
a crude knife  i hitched myself back
toward it

  the creature was so absorbed with nan
that he didnt notice reaching the cor-
ner i lifted my arms and sawed at the
rope

  my wrists jerked free

  hope welled up within me i tore at
the bonds around my ankles   

  you would eh

  the monster snarled those words just
as i got the bonds loose he whipped a
knife from under his black coat and
lunged at me i had clawed to my knees
i came to my feet with both fists swing-
ing one missed the other smashed into
the hideous face

  but in the split second before it landed
i saw at this close range that the face
was only a clever mask my suspicion
had been correct

  the fiend rocked back a step then
swiftly he caught his balance and sprang
at me again i ducked too late the

blade of his knife dug into my shoulder
-and i felt life flow out of me

  i heard nan scream

  oh darling i sobbed as i sagged to
the floor my darling  

  i didnt lose consciousness but i lay
there limp and helpless while the fiend
pulled off the skull cap which had made
his head look hairless and the broken
mask which had covered his face the
features that had been concealed were
those of harry kent

  they were twisted into a characteris-
tically sardonic sneer but his eyes which
had always seemed devoid of any real
emotion werent the eyes of the harry
kent we all had known they burned with
sadistic cruelty

  youve signed her death warrant he
said id had an idea of pretending to
save her in the end if she suited me with
the money ill have in another couple of
days i couldve taken her on one hell of
a spree ive always had a yen for her

  harry    youre the monster nan
husked in an incredulous voice

  good god kent are you mad i
exclaimed you cant get away with
this

  cant  he shrugged i have

  but why are you doing it i asked
i tried to stall for time by inducing him
to talk i knew he was egotistical enough
to want to brag and perhaps in a minute
of rest i could regain a little strength

  why first for money an ava-
ricious gleam mingled with the cruelty
in his eyes i want a lot of money
thats why i went in with zorn as a se-
cret partner a year ago with my tips
we had chances to make a lot but then
he fried i couldnt save him but i
made him think i was going to save him
at the end thats why he was so brave
in the death chamber and so free with
his threats

itent laughed he thought id fix
the chair so he couldnt burn he
figured theyd have to let him go free as
a man legally dead i did fix the chair
when i got access to the death chamber
on the pretext of writing an article i put
some colorless lacquer impregnated with
asbestos on the electrodes sure i fixed
the chair-so hed burn slow and leave
the stage set for my act

  he paused to give me a moment to com-
prehend his diabolical brilliance i kept
drawing in deep breaths of air to clear
my head

  its a pretty good act isnt it he
fondled the hilt of his knife my two
helpers arranged the wreck of the hearse
by putting a log in the road they took
zorns corpse from the coffin and hid it
we even stole the corpses of zorns two
known henchmen from cemeteries to
make everything convince the most skep-
tical snooper then the masks-those
were real masterpieces dim light and
receptive minds made them plenty con-
vincing a touch of genius for my help-
ers were the clothes from the corpses we
stole they gave the authentic smell

  i flexed my muscles

  finally all that was needed was to
have ourselves identified it was quite sim-
ple i began by assaulting a few people
on the streets then i started to execute
zorns threats that was a pleasure in
the old mans case in fact i found i got
quite a kick out of murder-though i will
hate to kill nn he sighed but now
it must be done that is    soon

  my fists clenched

  my helpers tortured the man who sent
zorns two real henchmen to the chair
in order to identify themselves i tried
the same thing on ared zorn tonight to
make my identity stronger but he was
too shrewd and had to die when we
committed a robbery we usually commit-
ted a murder-to create the horror what
convicts from hell



we wanted and got was a city so terrified
that we could have access to any building
and yet be in no danger we-

  i couldnt stand any more of that fiend-
ish story drawing in a quick breath i
pulled myself to my knees and threw my-
self at kents legs

  i took him by surprise he toppled to
the floor as he whipped the knife down
at me i managed to catch his wrist
wrench it grab the knife with my other
hand

  then i stabbed him in the heart   

  i hardly remember what happened after
that i had almost shot my bolt but
somehow i did manage to free nan to-
gether with her holding me up most of
the way we stumbled out of the place be-
fore kents two corpses returned we
found my cab still waiting as soon as i
got inside i passed out cold

  

  i came to in the hospital nan a ten-
der smile on her face was sitting beside
the bed i signaled for a kiss

  youre going to be all right dear
she whispered to me afterwards there
was a catch in her voice

  of course i am silly i said ive
got a claim on the most beautiful girl in
the world and im sticking around to col-
lect   did the cops capture kents two
men 

  she told me they had later when she

figured i had recovered enough to talk
she asked how did you ever find me
how did you come to suspect harry
kent

  i shouldve suspected him long before
i did i grunted first i began to be-
lieve in the hoax when morey whom
kent failed to kill in his hurry to get you
told me you were gone i went to ared
zorns hed acted so nervous that i fig-
ured he must know something but i
guess his nervousness was just fear that
his brother really had returned to life
then when i found ared zorn dead i
came to my senses the most convincing
thing about the hoax was myron zorns
living after the switch had been thrown
suddenly i remembered that kent had
been in the death chamber alone and
that he knew enough about electricity to
fix the chair it occurred to me such a
hoax would be a typical product of his
clever but warped mind so i came to
his penthouse-or rather his cellar

  i caught my breath after all that talk-
ing

  free speech is not one of my beliefs
i said with a grin how about paying
for the one i just made

  she lowered her head to pay

  and honey i whispered in a min-
ute lets forget the whole horror lets
catch up on happiness

  she nodded

the manuscript which is written in faded ink on pages torn out of a ships log
was found by a geologist named john norman engaged in a mapping tour
which extended from juneau east to the western slope of the canadian rockies
he records that he discovered it near the center of the great basin which lies in latitude
 long  west sealed in a glass jar no other information is furnished by mr
norman save the small item of geological information which concludes this story we

present it verbatim and leave to the reader
prejudices and convictions

  i am making this record-so begins the ms
-more for the purpose of giving myself some-
thing to do for an hour or so rather than in
the hope that it serve any useful purpose to us
who are condemned to a living death in eternity
or to those who may conceivably discover it
after i have thrown it overboard what has
happened is so strange so weirdly horrible that
i can find no words to describe it in terms that
a possible reader might understand neverthe-
less i shall try in a three-dimensional form of
expression to describe what can only be a sort
of fourth-dimensional experience and hope that
some day science and metaphysics will have
advanced to the point where human beings may
be able to understand what has happened to us

  the queen charlotte bound north from ta-
coma was a fantastically alarming spectacle-
especially to one conversant with the supersti-
tions and mores of the sea-when i went down
to board her on that cloudy cold afternoon in
late february for one thing she had a decided
list to port for another the rats were pouring
out of her like disturbed flics from a rotting
carcass these things added to the mood of pro-
found melancholy that had plagued me all day
-and gave very definite evidence that the voy-
age ahead of me was a thing to be dreaded
for there is hardly a man who follows the sea
but believes in the unfailing omens of disaster
that a merciful providence affords to sailormen


the task of explaining it according to his

 nevertheless since i had signed the articles as
 second mate i was honor-bound to make the
 voyage so in spite of my certain knowledge
 of impending doom i boarded the vessel

   i found the ship in almost a state of mutiny
 the captain and first officer mr williamson
 held the crew aboard at pistols end i had no
 sooner boarded than the order was given to cast
 off and only after we had hoisted sail and were
 many miles at sea did the captain relax his
 vigilance and abandon the poop he called me
 into his cabin for i was a new man to him and
 to the queen charlotte

   he gazed at me speculatively for a few mo-
ments as i stood before him his cold grey eyes
seeming to plunge into the hidden recesses of
my mind and i could feel the icy inhumanity
of the man as it had struck me at our first meet-
ing indeed i regretted the necessities that had
forced me to take this voyage with a strange
master of no very savoury reputation and on a
hulk which was generally regarded as a hell
ship

   i trust mr sanders were his first words
 that you take no stock in the childish nonsense
 that is being babbled forard

   it was a question and a challenge at the same
 time i met it according to the dictates of my
 conscience as a matter of fact captain
 doone i replied i cannot truthfully say that
dark council



i do not believe in the significance of rats
leaving a ship about to -embark on a voyage   
however my presence here should be proof to
you that i shall do my duty and carry out the
orders of my superior officers to the end

  again he subjected me to that cold unemo-
tional scrutiny that was like the malevolent
glare of ice-blink in the north latitudes after
a time he grunted-a sound in which infinite
contempt was mingled with frigid anger

  it seems he said that  have shipped a
gang of milk-sops and idiots    that will be
all mr sanders your watch below i be-
lieve  

  that night in my first watch the men seemed
quiet if sullen and despondent i went forward
past the break of the poop leaned on the rail
and gazed out to sea with a feeling in my heart
that no words can describe it was not so much
the feeling-nay the convition-that i and all
this ships crew were going to our death it was
something infinitely more terrible-more dev-
astatingly unbearable than that i telt that we
were literally sailing into another world i was
like one who has turned his face from the earth
leaving all dear familiar and comfortable
sights sounds and experiences behind him my
b yfiges were burned-i was facing a cold alien
world from which there would be no returning
and yet many and many a time i had made this
self-same voyage on good ships and bad from
tacoma to seward and back from san fran-
cisco from seattle and vancouver to nome and
bristol bay and the aleutians-many many
times i was more at home on these seaways
than on any land-and yet 

  nothing was right about this voyage the at-
mosphere of the ship was strange and alien it
was as though somewhere somehow we had
turned a corner and did not know how to get
back   

  turned a comer how often in the months
that followed i would think of that phrase
how thin a partition separates human beings
from the unknown land that has somehow
trapped us and our vessel there would be some
point in writing this if i could send hack a
warning-specific directions-of how to avoid
the fate that has befallen us but i cannot i
can only tell what happened

  the next day we made a disturbing discovery
apparently every atom of food aboard was
spoiled the flour was mildewed and mouldy
the meat was rotten and maggot-infested even
the jerked meat was all but inedible and such
canned goods as we had aboard showed bulging
tops and bursting seams from the gaseous pres-
sure of the corruption within this discovery
nearly precipitated another riot and strident de-
mands came from the forecastle that we return

immediately to reprovisbn the captain refused
and quieted the men with the promise that we
would restore the larder at the first port of
call that would be vancouver which we could
be sure of rcaching before the month was out

  but on the day following it was found that
the water-butts had started seams and prac-
tically every drop of fresh water aboard had
been lost trickling down through the course of
the night into the bilge

  then indeed we had our hands full the
men had secured a few firearms somewhere
and headed by a huge swede by the name of
larsen they charged the poop the first offi-
cer and captain doone each killed a man i
fired over their heads thus incurring a black
look from the master but i could not bring my-
self to shoot the poor devils  at length quiet
was restored the leaders of the mutiny clapped
into the lazarette and we sailed on

  no need to recount the minor trials of the
remainder of that horrible voyage suffice it to
say that it soon appeared that we had indeed
sailed into an alien world our instruments still
recorded with seeming accuracy the sextant
the chronometer and the compass appeared to
register our position as faithfully as of yore-
but we were nonetheless lost as surely as though
every instrument has been thrown overboard

  the time came when we should have been
nearing vancouver-but we made no landfall
our instruments told us that we rriust be di-
rectly opposite juan de fuca strait-but we
saw no sign that this was so we turned and
sailed directly east-according to our instru-
ments-and we never saw land we sailed for
weeks we sailed until we should have been
half-way across the american continent-near
the th meridian our instruments said-and
still nothing met onr perishing gaze but track-
less endless illimitable miles of ocean and
then again we turned north

  it is strange that we lived for those weeks
and months we had no water or food we
were starving and dying of thirst-but we did
not die we suffered the tortures of the
eternally lost and damned in the deepest pit of
hell-but death would not come to end our
agonies we were a wasted shrivelled com-
pany of walking skeletons our skin blackened
our hair sere and dank our eyes staring metal
globes ringed by fevered fiery flash each man
gazed upon his neighbor with livid horror writh-
ing in his brain plain to see on his ghastly
cadaverous face but we could not die   

  and on and on forever on we sailed

  one day the captain threw the sextant and the
chronometer into the sea with an ax then he
shattered the binnacle and destroyed the com-
pass liar i he screamed in a voice that was

 like the shrieking of a loon liar-liar-liar 
 and swung the ax crashing down and then
 he lay stricken upon the poop and made no
 move for many days   

  it was i who first saw the ship

  strangely i could make no move for a time
it was like a horrible nightmare i would not
-could not believe that my eyes were not play-
ing me false i was frozen by the fear that it
was but an illusion of my fevered brain-and
then when i would scream the gladsome news
to my mates my voice failed me only a chok-
ing dry husk came from my throat that hardly
sounded in my own dulled ears i remembered
then that other seaman the poet wrote about-
that ancient mariner whose ship had likewise
transgressed the law of the sea and sailed into
an ocean of nothingness i remembered the line
    i bit my wrist i sucked the blood and
cried a sail a sail 

  as he had done i bit my wrist and the turgid
blood oozed out enough to moisten my palate
and the chords of my throat i shouted sail-
ho and sank upon the deck

  but none answered that call all lay about
the deck where they had been lying these many
weeks and not a man showed by the slightest
movement that he had heard

  for a long time i lay there watching that
ship come on and the weakness and pain of my
body would not permit me to signal her nor
even to give her a hail as she drew close enough
for them to hear me but it was plain that she
had sighted us that she was coming on to in-
vestigate this strange derelict that rolled in the
trough of the sea and yet forged onward at
good speed with sails flapping listlessly on the
masts and soon i could see the men about the
forecastle deck others in the rigging and all
occupied with the business of sailing their ves-
sel as all normal ships are sailed    and yet
i thought it is strange that all goes so quietly
aboard that ship for never had i seen men
behave that way when a passing vessel is
sighted it is a rare enough occurrence to draw
the attention of the entire crew on ships main-
taining even the most rigorous discipline-but
not a head was turned toward us save that of
the helmsman

  the ship came on and now desperation
drove me to my feet and i found the strength
to lift a shout of terror for the vessel was
closing down upon us under full sail if she
kept her course another minute she would ram
us and send both ships to the bottom of the sea
but my shrieks were in vain

  the bowsprit of the oncoming vessel loomed
amidships and i grabbed the rail and set my
body for the shock-but there was no shook

  the ship sailed on-cleaving through our mid-
dle as though ours was a vessel of cob-webs
and not a tremor not a sound signalled to my
straining anguished senses that we had been


rammed the body of the vessel shot through
ours-and was gone and with it went my con-
sciousness and i fell upon the deck like a storm-
felled mast   

  i know not how long i lay senseless upon
the deck of the accursed ship but when i
awakened it was to find our vessel gliding into
what seemed a great inland bay a shoreless
expanse of mirror-calm water shown beyond
the rocky abuttments of the entrance and some-
how i knew that an end to our suffering was in
sight

  as the ship swept through that narrow pass-
age i looked in growing wonder and awe upon
the rocky walls that rose on either side like
opalescent glass they were-but like no glass i
had ever seen before they shimmered with the
colors of the rainbow and seemed glossed over
with a flowing swirling sheen of light that was
never still and never twice the same it made
me dizzy and sick to watch-for all that it was
the most beautiful sight i have ever looked upon
-but the strangeness of it all drove fresh
anguish of fear into my heart and i dreaded
the unguessable things their weird appearance
portended

  and yet those beautiful walls were indeed
the herald of the end of our physical suffer-
ing we had no sooner left them behind
and passed into the quiet shoreless sea beyond
than every man rose from the deck and gath-
ered at the rail i felt the hunger and drought
leave my body to be replaced by a feeling of
lightness and health and i knew that what had
happened to me had happened to all the crew it
was strange though that this physical change
occasioned me no joy-nor brought an expres-
sion of happiness to the faces of my companions
they stood there at the rail where i joined
them and stood gazing back at the rocky escarp-
ment of the coast we were rapidly leaving be-
hind-but they spoke no word and i felt no
urge to speak to them

  time    what is time i thought we might
have stood there for hours as the ship plowed
onward through that quiet sea-tut perhaps it
was weeks we never moved nor felt any need
for movement the captain came down from
his poop and joined us but he spoke no word
to us and we did not address him we stood
and waited-and at long length the ship came
to rest   

  as i finish this account of the strange last
voyage of the queen charlotte i feel a vague
restlessness stealing over my senses is it the
beginning of the thing that has driven all the
crew but myself into the quiet turgid waters
of this eerie sea is it the thing that drove
them shrieking to throw themselves over the
rail in search of surcease from the madness that
writhed in their brains

  there is no sun nor moon nor stars above this
sinister water so i cannot say how long ago it
was that the first man went over it was little

 cox the cabin boy for a time he ran shriek-
 ing about the ship crying in a strange high
 voice without words-and at last cast himself
 into the water we watched him listlessly no
 man making a move to rescue him-for we knew
 that we were all beyond rescue he lay there
 quietly buoyed up somehow so that most of his
 small body was above the surface of the water
 he stared up at us with a strange questioning
 look on his drawn young face-and we gazed
 back at him blankly stupidly then slowly he
 turned over and began swimming away slowly
 he went at first with smooth rythymic strokes
 -then faster and still faster until it seemed he
 was swimming with a speed far beyond the
 powers of any mortal we watched him until
 at last he disappeared-a diminishing speck on
 the measureless breast of that still oily
 ocean   

   one by one they went like that-all in the
 same direction all with an accelerating speed
 that no man ever swam with before

   what shore awaits them is there beyond
 that sinister far horizon release from terror
 and pain is there forgiveness for the trans-
 gressions of this ship release from the doom
 brought down upon all our heads by its mas-
 ter for i know now that a curse has been
 upon us from the start

 the side before he sprang into the sea his
 voice was given back to him and he seemed to
 pray

   forgive me he shrieked and lifted his face
 to the empty sky forgive me for not answer-
 ing your call you men who died on the ship
 i passed while you signalled for aid-forgive
 mel

   then he rose and flung himself from the rail

   it is true then the tale that was told about
 the wharfs in tacoma captain doone on his
 last trip down from alaska had disregarded a
 distress signal   

   but i must end this my blood boils in my
 veins i seem obsessed with fiends who twist
 my brain in its skull who pluck at my nerves
 and claw at my throat so that i long to shriek
 aloud i must make an end  i must go to
 whatever shore my shipmates have found-for
 there lies my destiny  i know it  

   thus ends the only available account of
 the last voyage of the queen charlotte
 reported lost at sea many decades ago
 and the account is accompanied by a
 statement from the man who found the
 ms which may or may not possess
 significance

  the basin in which this ms wai
 found notes mr norman was once
 the site of a great inland sea which geo-


 logical records show extended from what
 is now the western coast of canada east
 to approximately the location of great
 slave lake this sea disappeared at the
 time the northern canadian rockies were
 formed-many hundreds of thousands of
 years ago

   men there are who claim to have come
 back from the dead others liave stories
 to tell which have the ring of truth-and
 yet are as strange as the one we have pre-
 sented here all over the world and in all
 ages records of experiences that seem to
 surpass what is known of normal human
 life have sprung up to set men wondering
 and speculating we are not able to judge
 what is true and what is not-unless we
 adopt some rigid standard of comparison
 that admits nothing not capable of physi-
 cal proof but at least we may thrill to
 the unusual the weird and the inexplic-
 able readers of dime mystery
 magazine have become connoisseurs
 of such stories
