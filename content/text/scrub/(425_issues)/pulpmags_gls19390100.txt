she was romanced
by galahad

galahad was charmed the legs so enticingly displayed were bare and

seductively formed

                 by michael hall

 the sun filters through the list-
 less trees that fringed the
 square and made weird pat-
 terns on the cracked paving a
 vagrant breeze fanned the dropping foli-
 age with a searing blast like the breath
 of the devil and the pattern on the pav-
 ing shifted uneasily

 at a rusted iron table which had
 weathered the storms of more than a
gay life stories



score of years in the inland village of rio
jamorca sat galahad oreilly late of
new york and even later of the oreilly
construction camp on the quezon

  for perhaps the tenth time in as many
minutes he cast a bleak stare of disap-
proval upon the deserted square and
cursed the climate of rio jamorca and
its invisible inhabitants with methodical
enthusiasm

  and galahad had reason to curse for
two months following his arrival in the
south american republic galahad had
sweltered in the heat of the tropical jun-
gle as technical head of the construction
company driving a spur line from the
main road to the american owned silver
mine at the head waters of the quezon

  for two months he had battled flies
mosquitoes and the thriving species of
venomous reptiles that abound in the
south american jungle and now on his
first visit to the town he was met with
all the warmth and hospitality usually
accorded the rent collector on the first
of the month

  galahad pounded vehemently on the
iron table and added to the din by raising
his voice in a strident bellow

  hey waiter service

  a bulky little man swathed in a soiled
white apron approached leisurely and
hung confidentially over galahads
shoulder

  si senor

  whiskey snapped galahad peevish-
ly and plenty of it and say pedro are
there any people in this village women
for instance

  the bulky little man smiled uncertain-
ly and bobbed his head in bewildered
agreement

  si senor i get heem at once

  galahad sighed morosely and that
he muttered is that i certainly made a
star spangled ass of myself by coming to

this god forsaken rim of civilization the
people cant even speak english

  he sipped moodily at a glass of ex-
cellent liquor that was presently placed
before him and meditated upon the twist
of fate that had lifted him from his fav-
orite haunts on broadway and placed
him in the midst of the argentine jungle

  so engrossed did he become in the
mental perusal of the sad events leading
to his banishment that he failed to notice
the approach of a solitary wayfarer along
the tree shaded walk

  he became suddenly aware that he was
the object of scrutiny by a pair of cool
grey eyes that appraised him with evi-
dent amusement she was young and
beautiful with the mysterious allure that
is so often the heritage of the latin wo-
man raven liued hair framed the oval of
her face forming a vivid contrast to the
frock of dazzling white which she wore

  galahad for the moment was speech-
less that the village of rio jamorca
could produce anything as dainty and
fragilely beautiful as this diminutive
young woman was impossible that she
should betray the slightest interest in
young mr oreilly was incomprehen-
sible

  recovering from his amazement gala-
had made a gallant effort to rise to the
occasion the rickety iron chair
screeched its protest as galahad rose
awkwardly

  buenos noches senorita he began
gallantly er-hablo-er- for the mo-
ment he struggled with his scant knowl-
edge of spanish and then burst out ex-
plosively how in hell am i going to ask
her to join me in a drink

  at that the young woman moved leis-
urely across the paving and seated her-
self gracefully across the table from gal-
ahad whose mouth dropped open in as-
tonishment


gay life stories

  make mine a rum punch she said
languidly in perfect english

  you-you speak english it was not
so much a question as a statement of a
fact too miraculous to give credence gal-
ahad was still staggered

  speak english of course i speak
english i spent seventeen years in new
york she burst into a torrent of fluent
spanish which changed the gentle amble
of the little waiter to something resem-
bling a gallop and turned her attention to
galahad

  you looked so forlorn sitting here by
yourself that i thought id join you she
explained carelessly besides its bad
for your disposition to drink alone

  you live here asked galahad in-
anely his eyes feasting on the beauty of
her features

  naturally do i look as if i had walk-
ed over from the coast this morning
she sipped her liqueur with evident en-
joyment and crossed her slim legs care-
lessly before her

  galahad was charmed the legs so en-
ticingly displayed were bare and seduc-
tively formed and the sheer silken shirt
fell away at the knee exposing an ap-
preciable amount of nude thigh the sit-
uation decided galahad had possibili-
ties

  what i mean he explained hastily
is that you dont look as though you
lived here the few people ive seen in
the town all look like something the dog
found out in the alley and dragged in to
play with you know-kinda ragged

  the girl shrugged disdainfully my
father is governor of this province we
live here in the dry season because the
climate is so much better

  galahad started he had been in the
country long enough to realize that
young women of the upper classes were
not encouraged to make casual acquaint-

ances with strange young men especial-
ly not the daughter of the governor a
crusty gentleman with old-fashioned
ideas and a violent temper

  galahad sighed heavily so youre
the daughter of old valento thats too
bad

  the girl looked up with bright inter-
est and why is it too bad

  burny-burn said galahad glumly
my job depends a whole lot on your
old mans good will if he takes a dislike
to me hes apt to get his back up and
forget all about the various concessions
lies made our company

  but father explained the girl de-
murely isnt here he left for callao
yesterday

  and left you all alone there was
astonishment in galahads voice

  not quite but my duenna was taken
ill last night and so im practically alone
i was frightfully lonesome she confided
and thats why i walked down here to
see if you were young and nice looking
if you had been old i would not have
stopped she confessed naively

  you knew there was a yankee in
town 

  oh yes you see the servants talk
i was afraid of that muttered gala-
had grimly but he added recklessly
let them ill live in the present and let
the future take care of itself aloud to
the girl he said

  you being practically a new yorker
and me just banished from the gay night
life we ought to get together and plan
something maybe talk over old times or
something like that he smiled engag-
ingly

by me said the girl that is swell
have you any other bright suggestions 
your name for instance if i knew
that and you knew mine we might feel
that we were properly introduced and all
gay life stories



that sort of thing

 the girl nodded your name she
announced succinctly is oreilly   
galahad oreilly the chorus girls
angel

 galahad winced my god how did
you know that 

  oh we subscribe for the new york
papers father has taken quite an inter-
est in your various escapades he always
holds you up as a bad example

  ill bet he does at that breathed
galahad and your name is   
blanche in spanish it is blanchita

and then what asked galahad
and then we might  we might
read books suggested blanchita slyly

  books galahad raised shocked
hands aloft my dear child i never
read a doctor once told me it was bad
for the eyes he said do anything but
dont read books

  okay well follow your doctors ad-
vice

  galahad was slightly bewildered
what do you mean well follow my
doctors advice 

just what i said well do anything

she glanced at him pertly you like it
naturally i think ill call you blan-
chita i like it better the question is
now what do we do next

  im a little girl all alone in a great
big house laughed blanchita if that
means anything to you i thought we
might have dinner  a cocktail   
and then  

what if your father
should return unexpect-
edly he wouldnt ex-
actly like it would he


gay life stories

  galahad drew a deep breath to ease the
rapid pounding of his heart surely this
was the stuff of which dreams were made
-the gossamer threads which novelists
wove into stories    the rare occasion
men spend a lifetime searching for

  we might begin our celebration
now he suggested draining his glass at
a gulp

  together they wandered slowly
through the deserted streets of rio
jamorca conscious of the avid eyes that
watched their progress from behind the
chastely closed green shutters that were
barred to the late afternoon heat

  they paused before a cool white build-
ing set in the midst of a spacious garden
where palmetto trees waved their delicate
fronds almost to the edge of the red tiled
roof and blanchita waved her hand
airily

  senor we are arrived at our destina-
tion she dropped him a mock curtsey
and led him through the huge grilled
gates into the silence of the patio a
fountain splashed musically in its granite
basin

  they dallied carelessly over iced
drinks served them by an aged servitor
until the sun sank out of sight in a golden
glow and then blanchita laid her small
hand on galahads arm

  come she said softly we shall have
dinner and then you shall show me if
you are indeed named correctly

  named correctly echoed galahad

  wasnt galahad the white knight

  galahad smiled ruefully youre jest-
ing theres nothing pure about me

  thats what i wanted to find out im
tired of these men of my race who are so
afraid of my father

  thats another thing you being here
alone and all that wont it be danger-
ous 

  blanchita grinned impudently i hope

  but listen galahad said earnestly
what if your father should return un-
expectedly he wouldnt exactly like it
would he

she appeared before him clad in
a filmy negligee

  pouf blanchita snapped her fingers
are you afraid of my father she
taunted there is yet time for you to
return to your construction camp

  galahad was stung by the thinly veiled
scorn in her voice he moved impulsively
toward her and slipped his arm about her
waist and thrilled to the feel of her soft
flesh for a long moment he gazed into
her eyes consciously of the fleeting ter-
ror in their depths  of the labored
rise and fall of her hard young breasts
and then he slowly pressed his lips
against the moist sweetness that were her
lips

  as their bodies melted together a great
passion surged through galahad for this
girl whom he had met so casually he
pressed her yielding body closer and
bruised her lips with his caresses

  breathlessly he released her wonder-
ing at the starry beauty of her eyes

  come she whispered tremulously
tonight is made for love tomorrow   
she shrugged expressively tomorrow is
another day

  together they made their way through
the silent house until they stood before a
carved oaken door studded with great
brass bolts

  beyond this door murmured blan-
chita lies my room    and love she
turned the latch and they stood in the
darkened confines of a room that it was
her room galahad knew immediately

  the faint scent of the delicate perfume
she used clung to the atmosphere like a
benediction her hand clasping his she
led him to a deep window seat placed
beneath the grilled window beyond the
horizon a great yellow moon was pushing
its way into the sky a soft breeze stirred
the trees in the garden below

  sit here and wait for me whispered
blanchita brushing galahads brow with
her lips she was gone but he could hear
a faint rustling of silken garments as she
moved about

  presently she returned to his side and
he caught his breath in wonder at the
sheer loveliness of her in the faint light

of the moon she appeared before him clad
in a filmy negligee that revealed her glo-
rious arms and shoulders he crushed
her pliant body to him hungrily

  galahad took no notice of the passage
of time in the enchanted hours that
passed on the wings of fleeting love he
lay drowsily in the arms of the girl whom
he had suddenly come to love they were
silent meeting on the common ground of
a love that had no need for words

  suddenly the silence was shattered by
a crashing rap on the door for one tense
moment they lay rigid and then the sum-
mons was repeated

  blanchita my child roared a voice
my god breathed galahad and all
the windows barred

  blanchita roared the voice open
this door before i kick it down

  galahad shrugged philosophically
better open it sweet

  he shant hurt you my love i wont
let him consoled blanchita slipping her
feet into mules just keep cool

  keep cool stuttered galahad im
so cool now my teeth are chattering
he hurriedly tried his tie making a
ragged job of it in the dark and seated
himself in the window in what he hoped
was a casual attitude

  into the room burst a bulky figure
carrying an old-fashion lamp galahad
who had never met the governor had an
impression of ferocious mustachios that
curled up to meet small pig-like eyes that
were sparkling with ill-concealed rage

  aha so its true bellowed the in-
truder a man and in my daughters
bedroom ill have your life for this

  he shook off the hand blanchita laid
beseechingly upon his arm and strode
closer to galahad pig what are you
doing here

  what does it look like im doing
demanded galahad sardonically read-
ing the gas meter 


gay life stories

  so it pleases you to be humorous
snarled the governor you can afford to
joke

  but father   

silence roared senor valento
fiercely i can attend to this matter he
turned to glare at galahad well young
man what have you to say for yourself 
well hedged galahad thinking rap-

idly if you just give me a little time
i can explain everything you see  

  time ha he wants time ill give
him time ill give him life ill give
him   

  while youre giving things away
murmured galahad reaching for his
cigarette case could you give me a
light

he shant hurt you my love i wont let him consoled blanchita
slipping her feet into mules
gay life stories



  the governor paused his face purp-
ling at galahads effrontery por dios
he gasped do you think to joke with
me you who have shamed my family
made of my honor a thing to be laughed
at  i think i shall kill you

  my father wouldnt like that at all
decided galahad inspecting the glowing
end of his cigarette and hes a very
nasty person to deal with when hes
angry and not only that but if you
should kill me your daughter and i would
not be able to get married

  marry my daughter the governor
recoiled as if he had been struck in the
face you didnt ask me

  no pointed out galahad carefully
i didnt in fact i hadnt thought of
marrying you at all

  in this country marriages are ar-
ranged by the parents thundered the
governor

  and in some countries they are ar-
ranged in heaven but they dont seem to
turn out as well as those arranged by the
two persons most interested countered
galahad coolly

  he felt blanchitas arm steal through
his and the pressure of her body at his
side and the sense of her nearness gave
him added courage

  your excellency appealed galahad
i was hasty in paying suit to your

daughter without first addressing you
but in my country women choose their
own mates blanchita and i love each
other we plan to marry have we your
consent 

  his excellency passed his hand over
his brow in a bewildered gesture

  you    you love this man child
he importuned hesitantly this man you
know nothing about 

  i love him father and i know all
about him

  know all about him gasped the gov-
ernor who then in heavens name is
he

  this is galahad oreilly quavered
blanchita pressing closer to galahad

  not pig head oreillys son thun-
dered his excellency

  yes sir thats what they used to
call him in college admitted galahad in
surprise

  pig head oreillys son mused the
governor smiling benignly on galahad
and reaching for the cigarette case in his
hand well well well we went to
school together i remember him well
this is fine he lit a cigarette and blew
a vast cloud of smoke at the ceiling ill
cable your father tomorrow so he can get
here in time for the wedding he paused
and stared at galahad amusedly

  she was only a photographers
daughter but oh - how she was
developed

  dont forget to have your news-

out west

by evaline french

ex mayo breezed into neil
waynes apartment with an
exuberance that characterized
all his movements hey
handsome he called met a smooth
girl who is just your speed come out
and get the lowdown

  not interested drawled a voice from
the bathroom

  rex snickered that was good from
old neil who counted the day lost that
didnt bring a pretty face a new intrigue
who couldnt resist feminine allure any
more than a bee could resist the sweet

this isnt rexs apartment protested joe
gay life stories



fragrance of spring flowers

  wait til you see her he went on
your technique is good but this gals
is better she radiates sex appeal and
curves man shes got plenty and other
things besides shes just in town for a
visit her home is in the west where
men are men and women go after em
i told her about you and she said to bring
you around and she would give you a
few pointers on how red men make
love

  neil strode in clad only in a pair of
silk shorts that clung to his muscular
litheness he was suffering from a hang-
over and took no pains to hide his vile
humor listen sap he said wearily
do i have to draw you a diagram 
am not interested i dont care how many
curves she has ive examined plenty at
close range alike

  rex shrugged his shoulders ok
he said in disgust if thats the way you
feel about it neil he decided certainly
must have been on an awful bender to
become a misogynist over night it
sounded fishy he picked up his gray
fedora and pulled it down rakishly over
one eye admiring the effect he knew
he didnt have neils way with women
but as he often remarked facetiously he
had had his moments

  so long grouch he said taking his
departure and if you should change
your mind about women drop in at chez
moi tonight and admit that my judgment
in some things is unerring

  neil lit a cigarette and stared morosely
at his reflection in the mirror his dark
handsome face his crisp blue-black hair
his superb physique brought him no sat-
isfaction he was fed up with everything
with girls who melted in his embrace at
a word with red lips that fastened
themselves hungrily on his with eyes
whose promise was not even thinly
veiled and man is supposed to be the

pursuer he thought in disgust

  mr waynes little boy neil hadnt
been born with a silver spoon in his
mouth it had been platinum with a dia-
mond-encrusted handle for good mea-
sure his motto was eat drink and be
merry for tomorrow you may wake up
and find yourself married he had

ivear her down eh

learned with the ease born of long prac-
tice to avoid the matrimonial trap prom-
ising himself vaguely that when the right
girl came along he would marry her pro-
perly with bell book and ring to date
the numerous girls who asked nothing


gay life stories

better than to be mrs neil wayne had
been unable to discover just what neils
conception of the right girl was mean-
while he went his merry way a suave
dilettante who showered his favors on a
different girl every night

  he honored miss jane carteret his
only living relative with one of his rare
visits that afternoon and politely listened
to a long tirade against the morals of the
younger generation by evening he felt
clear-headed and his old self again but
the satiated feeling lingered he still
wanted something different

  he thumbed his well-worn address
book idly it contained the names of
dozens of girls whom he could call at the
last minute and be assured a flattering
reception a well-manicured forefinger
went down the pages alphabetically be-
ginning with alden jean a diminutive
blonde and ending with a torid little
number who answered to the name of
marie zelli neil thought of maries
languorous black eyes her overripe
breasts her passionate lips of vivid crim-
son maybe under the spell of her kisses
he could recapture his lost zest for living
he picked up the telephone to call her
when rex mayos taunt flashed through
his mind your technique is good but
this gals is better    she said she would
give you a few pointers on how real men
make love the memory of the words
flicked neils vanity like a lash so this
girl from the west thought she was good
enough to show him a few things did
she well he was just in the humor to
call her bluff and when he got through
with her she would do no more boasting
this side of the rockies

  he felt quite cheerful about the even-
ing in prospect he could kill two birds
with one stone settle a grudge against
rex for talking out of turn and teach a
beautiful boaster her amatory a b cs

  when he arriver at mayos apartment

the living room was quite but sounds
from the kitchen told him that the party
had reached a hilarious state divesting
himself of coat and hat he saw that the
room held one occupant a girl asleep on
the divan intuitively neil knew this was
the girl rex had told him about she had
set the stage and no doubt warned rex
to keep the bunch out probably been
waiting for hours

  neil had expected to see a generous
display of curves but he was disappoint-
ed the girl was stretched out full length
but her legs were covered with only two
trim ankles peeping discreetly out her
dinner dress of coral moire was modest-
ly cut and her shouldres and breasts were
hidden she either wore no make-up
neil decided or she had done an un-
usually good paint job

  she would look like that he thought
sardonically remembering another girl
he knew who looked like a virgin but
thought the word meant a new kind of
drink this modesty trick didnt fool him
a bit

  he sat down on the edge of the divan
wondering what her boasted technique
was she certainly didnt look very sizz-
ling more like a school girl with her
mass of golden hair and delicate fresh-
looking skin

  at last the girl opened her eyes and
stared at neil hello she said drowsi-
ly have i been sleeping long 

  too long retorted neil youre
wasting precious time didnt anybody
ever tell you that its bad manners to
sleep at parties

  the girl widened her blue eyes naively
nobody she announced flippantly
seemed to care what i did then ab-
ruptly arent you neil wayne
now isnt it surprising mocked
neil that you should know my name
im flattered

  im jill painter i    she began
gay life stories



when neil interrupted its all been told
jill painter you have a good press
agent

  what have you hear about me im
curious said jill as neil helped her to
her feet

  oh among other things that you eat
little boys like me before breakfast but
lets dance its more intimate he an-
swered

  from the radio came the strains of a
tantalizing foxtrot neil took jill in his
arms her golden head rested against his
heart and he caught the whiff of faint
seductive perfume the skin that touched
his was delicately cool his arms tight-
ened about her and his lips sought hers
but to his surprise jill turned her head
id rather you didnt she said after
all were practically strangers

  neils jaw dropped in chagrin what
was the big idea he wasnt in the habit
of forcing his kisses but to have them
refused consternation gripped him for
a minute then he chuckled to himself so
she was a teaser and he would have to
wear her down eh well he had won
endurance contests before and the night
was but a pup

  after a couple of dances jill suggested
that they join the rest of the party but
neil had a better idea he knew from
experience that the combination of moon-
light moonshine and the coziness of his
low-hung roadster was hard for a girl to
resist besides there was a spot in
schenley park that was a perfect spot
to pet

  he drove expertly with one hand and
jill offered no objection when he placed
his other arm around her but that was
as far as he got the petting party he had
anticipated didnt materialize jill became
more desirable every moment piqued
neil told himself that he didnt care par-
ticularly about kissing her but he hated
to admit that he couldnt if he wanted to

oh well yaivned wanda why ivorry
i might not have liked him anyway    

he drove down the boulevard and
parked the car in front of an ornate
apartment building

   this isnt rexs apartment protest-
ed jill


gay life stories

  no i live here i think we need a
drink to pep us up

  id rather not really

  say whats the big idea asked
neil his voice edged with sarcasm
afraid ill eat you

  no-o-o said jill

  then up we go and without waiting
neil opened the door of the car and
escorted jill across the foyer to the el-
evator

  inside his apartment neil pressed a
button and bathed the luxurious living
room in soft light he made jill comfort-
able on the divan and proceeded to mix
two drinks one extra strong for his
guest who was entirely too sober

  sorry i havent any tequila to offer
you he said handing jill a glass but
this is pretty good stuff

  jill took one sip grimaced and set the
glass down

  for the love of mike drink up
ordered neil you havent taken enough
to dampen your tonsils

  i dont like it laughed jill wrink-
ling her nose

  quit stalling baby neil was get-
ting angry i have your number and you
cant pull that ingenue stuff around here
you are going to bottoms up on that
drink and like it

  no im not said jill serenely light-
ing a cigarette

  what a hell of a poor sport you
turned out to be

  jills eyes flashed dangerously if i
were a man you wouldnt say that

  all right im from missouri and
willing to be shown said neil taking a
pack of cards from the desk heres a
new deck high card wins if i win you
take that drink and give me a kiss not
that i want to kiss you he offered
coolly you arent the type that appeals
to me but just to show me you are game
if you win ill take you back to the party

and keep both hands on the wheel fair
enough 

  jill studied the rhinestone buckles on
her pumps a moment then she said non-
committally fair enough

  neil held out the deck and jill drew a
card it was the deuce of hearts neil
drew an ace laughing triumphantly ill
be a generous winner he promised
take your choice the drink first or the
kiss

  in answer jill raised her glass and
without removing it from her lips
drained it now take your kiss she
invited

  neils pulses were pounding he had
waited a long time for this kiss anticipa-
tion was sweet now he knew it was his
for the taking he could wait a little
longer how about something to eat
first he suggested although food was
the last thing he had craved surprisingly
jill agreed

  im not hungry for food either an-
swered neil thickly switching out the
lights he took jill in his arms and
strained her to him but he did not kiss
her yet instead one hand fumbled at
the catch of her dress a shoulder strap
gave way under the strain and the stiff
silk slid to the floor neil made the de-
lightful discovery that jills charms were
no longer hidden not even a brassiere
to halt predatory fingers starting at two
dimpled knees his hands traveled up-
ward in thrilling exploration satin-
smooth thighs a waist so slender he
could have encircled it with his hands
budding breasts that fluttered like fright-
ened doves as he kissed them he feasted
on their nectar until he remembered that
this was but the prelude of pleasure to
follow jills lips she wasnt cool now
he could feel her heart beating wildly
and her skin was warm under his moist
hands he crushed her mouth to his in a
breath-taking kiss

  at last spent with emotion jill gave	the following evening rex mayo was

a long shivering sigh oh-o-o she	busy his business concerned miss

breathed i never knew it would be like	wanda bayne a luscious bundle of

this	curves from denver and points west

   what asked neil stupidly still real men get kissed the doorbell buzzed
dizzy from the intensity of his emotion but rex weak from her kisses didnt

by alice hill

ayle hudson was feeling
unusually fit on this warm
summer afternoon felt hat
tipped down to shield his eyes
from the too-bright sun flannel shirt
open at bronzed neck hands thrust deep
into the pockets of whipcord breeches he
strolled lazily along the bank of the river
his body was of athletic proportions and
his sun-tanned face bore the clear clean-
cut appearance of a man well in both
body and mind he was ruggedly hand-
some keenly alive imbued with lithe
strength and slumbering energy

  rounding a bend in the river he seat-
ed himself upon a fallen log to idle away
a few minutes in admiration of the peace-
ful scene before him

  the surface of the water was calm and
unruffled and it gave an eye-dazzling
sheen where struck by the oblique rays
of the declining sun the bank leading
down to the water was weed-grown and
grassy sloping gradually from a hill
covered by a sparse growth of scraggly
timber the air was balmy and warm
with scarcely a breeze stirring frogs
croaked insects hummed dreamy tran-
quility hung over all

  gayles squinting eyes picked out an
object small and white laying on the
grass in the shade of a tree shielding his
eyes with his hand he stared again and
gave vent to a low exclamation of sur-
prise glancing out over the water he
was able to observe that which because
of sun-blindness had escaped him before
for a long moment he sat as one in a
trance staring-simply staring


gay life stories

  then a humorous smile winkled his
sun-tanned face and brought warm
twinkles into his eyes the smile turned
into a grin of downright deviltry and
with an abrupt movement he rose
walking softly his gaze still fastened on
something far out in the water he moved
silently down the bank of the stream un-
til he came to the shadowy tree there
he stopped

   at his feet lay a small pile of clothes-
feminine garments of apparel dainty
moccasins a pair of silk stockings a
short sports skirt a silk blouse a filmy
bit of lingerie a mannish sort of felt
slouch hat the sort of things usually
affected by ladies who go camping dur-
ing their vacations an attractive en-
semble of body covering seemingly with-
out a body to cover

  the body however-as gayle had al-
ready discovered-was far out in the
river enjoying the cooling effect of the
calm unruffled water it was unde and
white-very white in contrast to the
background of green hillside and trees
a nymph-like thing in a pagan setting
an object to admire and adore

  the lady was standing in shallow
water near the opposite bank of the river
immersed to a line just above her hips
so that only her torso was visible she
was standing with back turned and ap-
peared deeply interested in the antics of
a pair of birds who had built their nest
in a tree nearby she had not yet seen
gayle nor been made aware of a pres-
ence other than her own she was wholly
unsuspecting

  but suddenly she turned and started
wading toward the bank on which she
had left her garments perhaps some sub-
tle instinct warned her or maybe she
saw gayles reflection in the mirror-like
surface of the water anyhow all at
once she raised her eyes and discovered
him

  he caught the expression of swift sur-
prise that spread over her lovely face
the look of alarm and fright that leaped
into her glowing eyes he heard her gasp
and stifle an exclamation lie witnessed
the flushing of her cheeks as she realized
that she had been seen and he saw her
stop abruptly and clasp both arms over
her bare wet breasts

  it was the age-old gesture of the wo-
man surprised purely involuntary
prompted by the feminine instinct to
protect and shield her intimate charms
but in this instance it came too late
for gayle had already seen

  there was a brief pause a tense sil-
ence-then

  well she remarked coldly you
have me at a disadvantage yet you must
realize how embarrassing the situation is
for me and i trust you will prove to be
a gentleman

  gayle did not at once reply he was
too greatly absorbed in watching circular
ripples of water beat against the womans
undulating waist as she moved he was
trying to discover if the transparency of
the water would permit him to glimpse
things that lay below the surface but in
a moment he found his voice

  im sorry he stammered im
afraid i dont understand

  then you are not a gentleman she
stated flatly a gentleman would at least
have the decency to apologize for intrud-
ing upon a ladys privacy

  gayle stared a smile twitching his
lips she glared back at him eyes hot
with anger and humiliation

  i assure you i did not mean to in-
trude he informed her i had no idea
you were here i was just out walking-
say for my health

  there was another brief pause then
then perhaps you will kindly go
away so i may come ashore and dress
she said icily
gay life stories



  why do you want me to go away
he asked provokingly theres room for
two under this tree and i wont inter-
fere with your dressing

  the lady grew pale with anger and her
eyes flashed dangerously she glanced at

her clothes then far down the river as
if pondering whether to sacrifice her
modesty or swim home finally she
turned chin resolute and defiant

all right cheap guy she gritted
ill come out and when i do ill teach

he saw in my unfortunate predicament a chance to projit


gay life stories

you what it means to insult a lady ill
slap that fresh mouth of yours if its my
last act on earth

  gayle threw back his head and roared
then abruptly he checked his laughter
as he observed the expression on her
face

  why dorothy he said gently i
wouldnt have believed you capable of
such savage emotions

  dorothy  she exclaimed with a
complete change of manner do you
know me

  of course i know you dorothy
ellis he chuckled do you suppose id
have dared pull this kid stuff if you had
been a strange woman  knowing you as
i do i was sure youd forgive me

  still laughing at her surprise he re-
moved his hat so that the rim wouldnt
shade his face

  gayle she exclaimed after glimps-
ing his features why gayle hudson
what are you doing here in these hills
spending my vacation he replied
living in a shack about a mile down the
river

  great splendid well have to renew
our acquaintance wont we

  of course he assured her but-
arent you afraid of catching cold
hadnt you better come out now 

  she hesitated cheeks flushing faintly
pink gayle waited smiling mischievous-
ly-

  im not exactly a prude she said
finally but-well you know how it is
the suns too darned bright turn your
back gayle wont you 

  gayle laughingly complied with her
wishes and the next moment he heard
her splash out upon the bank and knew
that she was hastily donning her clothes

  five minutes later they were sitting
side by side on the green grass gazing
fondly into each others eyes

  just fancy meeting you here he
murmured

  oh its not so strange she replied
im vacationing too the funny part of
it is that we should have decided to
spend our vacations in the same part of
the world how do you account for
that

the suns too darn bright turn your back
gayle wont you

  i cant he confessed its been a
year since we saw each other last i
couldnt have known your plans nor
could you have known mine it must
have been telepathy or something

  more likely fate she said lightly

  they gazed hungrily at each other for
a moment and smiled evidently they
gay life stories



had been acquainted before coming to
the hills

  where are you stopping he asked
curiously

  summer cottage back there  she
jerked her head indicatively its noth-
ing extra but good enough

  gayle slipped his hand over hers and
caressed her with his eyes prettier than
ever he murmured    but the same
blue eyes and golden hair

  she chuckled and regarded him warm-
ly

  arent you working for thompson
any more he asked

  oh sure holding down the well-
known secretarial position same as usu-
al  but even the secretary to a wall
street broker must have her two weeks
of rest you know all work and no play
makes jill a wall flower

  i know he murmured i was just
wondering how you managed-

  you mean about the finances

  he nodded apologetically

  your curiosity is only natural under
the circumstances she said and her
voice grew rather strained t never was
blessed with money for a fact but in
this instance at least there was a way
she paused and glanced out over the
river avoiding his eyes

  there was a moment of silence then
gayle slipped his arm about her slender
waist and drew her close to him he em-
braced her tenderly as he murmured
of course its none of my business
dear i shouldnt be so dammed inquisi-
tive     but you know how i have al-
ways felt toward you dot    i-i wish
youd give me the lowdown on this it
seems funny my meeting you away off
out here i get the impression that
theres some mystery back of it all

  her hand crept up and closed over
his she turned her head that she might
gaze into his eyes

  i cant keep secrets with you gayle
she whispered but im afraid youll
hate me when the mystery has been dis-
pelled 

  hate you - never he said em-
phatically whats the answer-thomp-
son 

  she nodded he owns the summer
cottage where im staying thats why
im here instead of-somewhere else

  i see gayle muttered is he here
with you

  not at present but he came out with
me a few days ago

  you-youve been living with him-
here 

  for a moment dorothy was silent
staring moodily at the ground then with
a slow flush creeping into her cheeks
she raised her head and stared gayle


gay life stories

squarely in the eyes

  yes she said dully you may as
well know the truth gayle im a
keptee

  i-im sorry he mumbled i-i
wish this hadnt happened for your
sake darling

  yes she said i believe you do-
and i believe you are sincere  i
too wish it hadnt happened of course
i might explain matters but it would
probably sound as if i were only search-
ing for excuses

  tell me he said dropping a kiss in
her golden hair i wont misunderstand
honey ill know youre speaking the
truth

  she gave a short sigh and leaned
closer resting her head on his broad
shoulder at the moment she seemed
very tired very weary of her recent past
and all she had gone through

  it was mother she began i had to
do something for her sake of course
you know ive been her sole support ever
since i wrent to work there was nobody
else to do for her it had to be me

  i understand he breathed

  well she was taken sick-desperate-
ly sick she had to be taken to the hos-
pital and she had to have a serious oper-
ation doctors nurses x-ray pictures-
all of those things cost money gayle
my small savings werent enough they
were depleted during the first few weeks
i needed at least five hundred dollars to
square everything and i didnt have it
and didnt know where to get it i was
almost frantic with worry and anxiety

  poor kid he murmured patting her
shoulder gently

  i went to my boss thompson she
continued i told him my story and
asked his advice i asked him if he knew
of some way by which i might raise the
needed money some legitimate busi-
nesslike way i meant well thompson

has been my employer for three years
during that time he has been kind to me
after a fashion but he is always the un-
scrupulous man in matters pertaining to
business hes shrewd and cunning he
saw in my unfortunate predicament a
chance for him to profit

  the dirty devil gayle muttered
under his breath

  he made me a proposition i needed
five hundred dollars to care for my
mother he would place that amount to
my credit providing i would agree to
spend a week with him here in these
hills i could accept the offer or-let it
alone    well it was my only chance
what else could i have done i thought
of my future i thought of-you gayle
and then i thought of that poor woman
my mother who was then lying at deaths
door

  i know gayle said huskily you
did quite right dont let it worry you
i paid the bills and engaged a nurse
to care for mother during her convales-
cence i fixed everything nice for her i
told her that my boss was sending me to
a branch office for a few days to take
another girls place then i packed a few
things and came here with him    it-
it seems rather awful in a way and yet-
im not sorry gayle when i think of
what it meant to her    

  gayle stared at the mass of golden hair
so close to his face and hugged the girl
tighter in his arms he tipped her head
back and dropped a kiss upon her sensi-
tive lips

  why didnt you come to me he
asked you must have known that id
help you

  yes gayle she murmured youve
been sweet to me in the past im sure
youd have helped me but-i didnt
know where to find you we hadnt seen
each other for ages

  thats so he muttered how is
gay life stories



your mother now 

  almost well shell probably be fully
recovered by the time i get home
umm-perhaps not he said gruffly
why what do you mean

  youre going home sooner than you
intended he explained

  you mean- she suddenly sat up
staring wide-eyed into his face

  youre going to move-from thomp-
sons cottage over to my shack gayle
announced then were going in to town
the first thing in the morning    you
say thompson is away at present 

  yes he received a message which
took him back to the city early this
morning some business matter i be-
lieve but he intended to return some
time today

  yeah  well hes here now  spoke a
gruff voice behind them

  dorothy and gayle sprang to their
feet and whirled to stare there but a
few feet distant stood thompson-big
corpulent aggressive a fifty-cent cigar
in his mouth a fatuous sneer on his fat
face he had returned unexpectedly and
crept upon them unawares

  dot he snapped whos this guy
a-a friend of mine she stammered
mr hudson

  two-timing me eh

  no no honest our meeting was
quite accidental i had no idea he was
anywhere near here but it happens that
lies vacationing in a shack down the
river we just chanced to meet here to-
day 

  thompson chewed his cigar savagely
and spat hell he growled do you
expect me to believe that

  believe it or not mr thompson
gayle cut in swiftly it happens to be
the truth moreover miss ellis has de-
cided that she wont be in a position to
remain the rest of the week with you

im taking her back to town with me the
first thing in the morning

  oh yeah  thompson glared and his
bull neck turned almost purple

  yeah said gayle mimicking the
mans tone and manner i understand
that you forced her to enter a certain
agreement before bringing her out here
an agreement by means of which she re-
ceived from you something like five hun-
dred dollars

  thats true said thompson

very well said gayle quietly i
merely wished you to know that it shall
be my pleasure to give you a refund
and ill accept it said thompson
promptly

  very well said gayle his voice dan-
gerously calm here it is and with
the last word he stepped forward and
drove a straight clean punch to the big
mans jaw

  the blow came swiftly and was whole-
ly unexpected thompson gasped stag-
gered backward and fell sprawling on the
ground

  that  believe squares the account
said gayle with great satisfaction then
turning toward dorothy he took her arm
and led her down the bank of the river

  oh gayle she murmured gazing
proudly into his face

  tomorrow he said gruffly youll
be at home with your sick mother and
while youre there ill be down town
hunting up a license and a minister
were going to be married

the hottest hotel in town
carnival of passion

                by jerome fresco

-wi- ouella was in a terrible
 i quandary just a few minutes
before her dad had caught
 her in a most compromising
on the davenport with dicky
alderson and at the point of an anti-
quated revolver had marched them up
the adjoining rooms on the third floor
of the family home and locked them in
before he had closed the doors of their
respective dungeons however he had
announced his intention to drive to the
city at once and when he returned he
swore that he would be accompanied by
a fast-working justice-of-the-peace


gay life stories

  louella knew full well his intentions
a shot-gun wedding with all the custom-
ary accessories and an ensuing lecture
that would be certain to bore her to ex-
tinction

  she could have cried out in helpless
rage daddy hadnt understood for once
even the evidence of an eye-witness was
at fault for she hadnt really been guilty
of anything wrong

  dicky was a sweet boy and all that
but she could scarcely contemplate a life-
time at his side tonight under the spell
of half a dozen cocktails she had per-
mitted him a few intimacies - but he
hadnt even thrilled her the least bit and
then her daddy had to walk in on them
and accuse them of violating every sec-
tion of the alleged moral code what a
series of miserable breaks-and what a
drab future to contemplate

  the sound of gentle tapping on the
door communicating with the room into
which dickey had been bundled reached
her ears she stepped across the interven-
ing space and placed her head to the
panel

  lonesome dickey she inquired
with a sickly attempt at pleasantry

  the echo of his grunt was plainly dis-
cernible no he snorted let me in

  cant daddy took the key away with
him she ceased speaking as a sudden
thought flitted through her mind but
i think theres an old key in the bureau
drawer she finished

  thats a good girl dickys tone was
tense

  louella hurried to the bureau and
drew open one of the small upper draw-
ers in a moment she returned triumph-
antly to the door duplicate key in hand

  i found it dickey she giggled
turning it in the lock and swinging the
door inward its a pity that my mem-
ory doesnt serve me so well insofar as

keys to the other doors are concerned
oh whats the difference dickey
contemplated her blonde loveliness with
possessive eyes we may just as well be
married today as-

  dont be a sap louella interrupted
you may not object to the chafing
bonds of matrimony but ive got entirely
different ideas in that respect no ball
and chain for little louella not if she
can help it

  dicky fell back before her vehemence
i thought you liked me he accused i
-i didnt know you had been kidding
all along

  i do like you dicky boy louella
took one of his hands between both of
hers but liking isnt loving is it you
fail to awaken in me those thrills which
would make our marriage a success in
every way

  do you mean that  dickey was gen-
uinely surprised can you honestly say
that my kisses are kickless and my sex
appeal just isnt

  its better to be frank about it dont
you think so louella asked a little
doubtfully

  dicky nodded stroking his chin with
a listless air well what are we going
to do about it he demanded your
dad will be back in short order with a
wedding expert and well have to submit
gracefully or else-

  or else louella moved across the
room to the window and threw it open
ive got an idea if you effect a hasty
retreat through this window daddys
plans will all go up in smoke how about
it

  dicky joined her at the aperture but
his expression was one of absolute glum-
ness as he contemplated the earth three
stores below

  fat chance lou he growled if i
had the wings of an angel maybe-
gay life stories



  louella eyed the bedclothes hopefully
you wont need wings if we can find
material to make a rope long enough
she suggested time is limited lets get
busy

  obediently but in sulky silence dicky
assisted her to remove the spread and
sheets and to knot them into a makeshift
rope it was apparent that he placed lit-
tle credence in her theory that the mater-
ial would prove sufficient to meet their
purpose

  finally the last piece of linen had been
removed from the two beds in the adjoin-
ing chambers and the last knot drawn
tight louella affixed one end of the long
rope to the foot of the bed rolled con-
veniently close to the window and slid
the remainder over the ledge

  im almost afraid to look she con-
fessed as the rope grew taut ten or
twelve feet more and id be willing to
chance it but the drop is going to be
too great see for yourself

  louella looked and the result of her
inspection disheartened her the rope
lacked at least twenty-five feet of reach-
ing the ground

  she walked frantically about the room
seeking a few additional strips of cloth
but her quest was in vain they had em-
ployed to best advantage everything
within accessibility

  imagination rallied to her assistance
and she brightened perceptible youre
certain that the addition of ten feet will
enable you to risk it she asked excited
as a child

  yes but-

  no alibis dicky sweet off with
your coat vest and trousers well make
those ten feet

  the occasion was not one conducive
to pleasant argument dickey submitted
without a struggle

  louella smiled inwardly as she shed

his eyes lighted up as he took in the splen
did details of her beauty   

each garment his embarrassment tickled
her dicky was a decent chap and the
greatest sport in the world she decided
almost she loved him


gay life stories

  but even his whole-hearted sacrifice
proved useless after the various articles
of apparel sacrificed by dicky had been
added to the rope it lacked still three
or four feet of attaining the specified
minimum

  we wont quibble over trifles when
the emergency is so great louella re-
marked seating herself on the edge of
the bed and kicking of her shoes slip
out of your undies like a good little boy
while i donate my all to the cause

  you mean- dicky could scarcely
credit the evidence of his ears

  in toto dearest louella grinned
impishly terrible diseases require ter-
rible remedies dont they after youve
reached the ground safely you can untie
your own duds and put them back on in
the meanwhile ill yank mine back up
and endeavor to make myself presentable
for the meeting with dad and his disap-
pointed j p

  as she spoke she drew her dress and
slip over her head tossing them uncon-
cernedly on the floor beside dickys dis-
carded undies her stockings followed in
due season

  sheerly unconscious of his own lack
of apparel dicky proceeded to add the
final details to the rope but he could not
resist the temptation to cast a number
of surreptitious glances at his fellow con-
spirator

  his eyes lighted up as he took in the
splendid details of her beauty so clearly
revealed through the dainty dance set of
chiffon anties and lace brassiere louella
was indeed a lovely creature the won-
derful smoothness of her snow-white
skin the perfection of her rounded torso
glorified by the curves of hips and
thighs the sweet enticement of her high
full breasts

  he was painfully aware of the fact that
the rope was now long enough to suit his

purpose for a moment he wavered
then filled with an uncontrollable desire
to revel for a few minutes more in close
proximity to his feminine deity he flung
down the rope in disgust

  still a foot or so too short he lied
cant you spare just a little more

  louella colored to the roots of her
hair fully aware of his devouring gaze
although tempted strongly to sneak a
glance in his direction she exercised
every last atom of her will-power and
looked the other way

  i-i cant she stammered nervous-
ly youll have to try it-

  i wont he insisted stubbornly its
my neck you know and i positively
wont risk it unless the rope is lengthened
a bit more and he smiled to himself in
absolute satisfaction

  louella deliberated inwardly for a mo-
ment it would be exceedingly embar-
rassing to shed the last vestige of her
modesty-but infernally more embarras-
sing to find herself mated for life with
a man unable to stir her as completely
as she wished her decision was quickly
formulated

  the delicate brassiere and panties were
offered as the ultimate sacrifice

  dicky affixed them to the rope without
comment and strode to the window as
he lowered the rope through the window
however he turned to survey the little
huddled figure on the bed at last he
justified himself he was entitled to an-
other generous inspection

  but that final inspection proved his un-
doing it would be impossible for him
to descend the rope in his present nerv-
ous condition the blood roared in his
arteries the veins in his temples throbbed
like a trip-hammer and his hands trem-
bled as with palsy

  i-i cant go now he whispered i
cant
gay life stories

 louella lifted her head sharply what
 do you mean she asked

he moved closer you wouldnt
understand he pleaded youve never
been thrilled-but i have

but louella was beginning to under-
stand and the blood receded from her
face as that comprehension became pain-
fully clear

you-youve got to go-now she
urged

i wont



  he advanced upon her and threw his
arms about her his fingers stroking her
velvety flesh his eager lips seeking hers

  dicky she struggled desperately to
free herself but each motion she made
only served to draw her closer into his
embrace have you suddenly gone
crazy 

  about you my darling his lips
swooped downward found hers and lin-
gered there while his single free hand
cupped one of those pink-tipped breasts

  dicky suddenly realized that he en-
joyed complete mastery of the situation
and he gloried in his power so this de-
lightful if stubborn creature had doubt-
ed his ability to thrill her did she  well
she would learn that she had been quite
mistaken in that respect

that had lured him on irresistibly

louella became frantic please dicky
-im begging you she gasped resort-
ing to tears where open defiance had
failed

but dicky had long passed the stage
where reasoning might have affected him


gay life stories

his mouth bit into hers dining tenaci-
ously and he drew her closer in a cruel
embrace

  louella began to enjoy the strangest
sensations she ever felt in her life little
thrills paraded up and down her spine
exciting her to the point of ecstasy a
sudden realization came over her dicky
was the thrilling type

  with a blissful rapture of abandon-
ment she surrendered herself to the joy
of the moment she seemed to melt and
fuse against him she was in that magic
moment all carnal all sensuous

  he drew her closer the firm sharp
points of her breasts pricking his chest
perspiration covered him like a shower
and all his flesh tingled as if afire

  young blood ran riot in a carnival
of passion   

  louella stirred gently and opened her
eyes strong hard arms still encom-
passed her shoulders and her cheek rest-
ed very close to a heaving masculine
bosom

  dicky darling she whispered

  dicky lowered his head yes sweet

  youd better draw our clothes up so
that we can crawl back into them theyll
be dropping in on us in a minute

  dicky stiffened but - you - you
dont want to marry me do you he
asked

  dont i louella tortured him with
the suggestiveness of her insistence do
you think id let you go now after youve
thrilled me more completely than any
one else on earth could

  dickys hands traveled wonderful
girl he whispered happily ill put on
my clothes now-but as soon as the im-
promptu ceremony is over-

  well push them out of the room and
begin our glorious honeymoon-right
here louella finished for him

  do you believe in long engage-
ments

  sure the longer a man is engaged
the less time he has to be married

 when i was popping
 the question to nance

  i got a brogan

  right smack in the pants
  and through the doorway
   sailed like a linnet

  for her dads number
  eleven was in it

powder

 while i watch the girlies dance
 gaily to and fro

 as they seek to find romance
 in these ways of woe
 candor blushingly relates

 as they do their stuff

that each dame manipulates
a mean powder-puff

 striving hard to look her best
 powdering her pan

each fem with unflaggering
   zest

      fights to land her man
 while i fill their eager ears
 with my warning cry

 put your trust in god my dears
 but keep your powder dry
