the ahnihiator comes by ed earl repp yielding to the demands
of our readers our popular author gives us now a sequel of his beyond
gravity in this thrilling story we get the further adventures of the great
airship annihilator and its brave commander bob allison into the

adventures and a terrible menace that man had never dreamed of in-
cidcntly our author gives us a new view of the arctic zones that is startling
and revolutionary yet has a good deal of authority for it

the torpedo terror by edsel newton it has already been acknowl-
edged that it is possible to send an airplane into the air and guide it by
radio controls without the need of a pilot the immense importance of this
in a war in the air cannot be overestimated for by means of radio controls
it will be possible for a nation to send thousands upon thousands of planes
laden with high explosives over the enemy lines but the torpedo terror
is not a war story in fact it is the working out of a great mystery and the
saving of the world from a terrible disaster

the bat-men of mars by wood jackson the concluding instalment of
this marvelous interplanetary story is by far the most exciting part our
explorers from the earth are coming to grips with a strange civilization
pitting their strength and ingenuity against the terrible super-strength of
another race they show through page after page of this swift-moving talc
that when interplanetary travel comes we must be prepared to meet it no

leaping upward from every sharp point and edge of rock amber-colored flames shot up as
high as three or four feet
the air trap

by the author of the planets air master in two worlds etc

             in the twilight of a tropical sunset a giant grey-
             i son mail plane stood poised before its hangar

 its rounded nose flanked on each side by three
 i great motors was pointed to the west towards
 i the miles of trackless jungle over which it would
 soon be soaring on the newly formed mail route to the coast-
 to capetown

   ive got a funny feeling in my bones jim rogers a young
 relief pilot at the kimberly field said to a second birdman
 standing beside him they were watching the huge silver bird
 warm up for the flight

   i dont wonder at your funny feeling returned tom
 curtiss the second pilot after losing a ship last night and
 one a week ago

   thats what comes of trying to hurry
 things along too fast jim spoke again

 we have a stretch of  miles of con-
 tinuous jungle to fly over and what have
 we for guidance where are our beacons
 warning signs or landing fields from
 here to the coast we havent a single sign
 to guide us just blind flying all the way
 and only two spots where a fellow can
 land provided he is able to find them

   the radio beam will keep you on the
 track and its going continuously during
 every trip curtiss answered

   the radio beam my eye exclaimed
 rogers did you hear what weldon had
 to say about the radio guiding beam when
 he dropped in here with the mail last tues-
 day evening he followed the beam de-
 pending upon it and he was no more than
  miles out when he lost it altogether

 he flew miles off his route trying to pick
 it up but it was over an hour before he struck it again even
 his compass stuck on him on that trip and it was only by
 keeping certain mountain peaks and such land marks in view
 that he was able to keep from wandering farther off the route
 now where would weldon have been if that trip of his had
 been at night instead of day-and storming at that weldon
 wouldnt have had one chance in ten of getting through if
 he didnt crash into some mountain side he would have used
 up all his fuel trying to get through and find his way home
 im telling you tom ive no desie to stick around this vicin-
 ity at all in the first place i have no love for tropical flying
 the air is about as tricky and treacherous right here as it
 could be anywhere

   take a look at that sunset over there as red and as pretty
 as if you were viewing it through
 the golden gate at home but
 nine chances out of ten theres
 either a cyclone or an all-electric
 thunderstorm skulking below that
 horizon no sir ive no confi-
 dence in this tropical atmosphere
 at all the barometer has a habit
 of dropping too fast and too low

   well youre right in a way

 jim it is a damn dangerous
 route for a mail line of course
 theyre clearing up landing fields
 along the way now and setting
 up beacons but until they get the
 route lit up they should send the
 ships around the other way

edward e chappelow

 to capetown its a darn sight safer and easier line to follow
 but it means another hour or two in the air and that costs more
 besides it slows down the service theyve lost more money
 in the two planes that have disappeared than theyll ever get
 by cutting the time down this way not to mention the four
 lives that probably were cut short when them planes crashed
 im telling you tom its madness to send planes out over such
 a run at night why man the search parties havent even
 found the wreckage of those other ships yet and the one that
 came down a couple days after they opened up this line
 whats the trouble asked curtiss

    its due to this infernal atmosphere rogers said excitedly
                       why man every fellow who has hopped this run will tell
                       you that his radio receiver has gone bugs at times so that he
                       couldnt hear a sound except a thunder of
                       static then theres weldon and bradley
                       theyll both tell you that the guiding beam
                       just simply ceased to exist although they
                       knew that they were on the route she
                       just takes a notion to drop dead for a
                       stretch of fifty miles then comes back on
                       the air again then again how come so
                       many of the fellows claim that their com-
                       pass stick on them at times its this
                       tricky atmosphere that they have here if
                       i know anything

                      the roar of the battery of motors on
                    the waiting plane now drew the attention
                    of the two pilots who silently watched the
                    trim glittering ship start down the field
                    and climb into the air disappearing into
                    the blazing red western sky

 ive got a funny hunch that hes headed
 for trouble jim broke the silence as the
 two commenced to walk toward the field
 office too many of the boys have had trouble getting through
 in daylight to give me any faith in a night run

    entering the office they approached the desk of watson the
 airport chief

   you look a bit worried chief tom commented as he
 noticed a slight frown on the others face

   i am those damn fools at capetown insist upon keeping
 up the night schedule in the face of whats happened i just
 sent weldon on tonights hop the poor fellow was nervous
 you could see it but he never said a word hes one of the
 best pilots weve got thats why i sent him because if any
 man can get through then weldon will

    and what are they going to do about the situation  asked
 jim

 they

 q ure they should

 j should make a bee line
 for the coast and follow it down

 rhe airplane has done one notable thing v
 i no other-if has opened up to man
 vast areas  untraveled unknown lands
 and those aviators who at the risk of their
 lives have charted the air lanes over these
 vast deserts and jungles have erected tor
 themselves a reputation as the true pio-
 neers of this century

   many of them have met with experiences
 stranger than anything toe can suspect and
 unfortunately few have returned to tell us
 of them but whatever any aviator might
 have seen or met certainly nothing could
 have been stranger nor more exciting than
 the air trap our author writes -the trap
 from which few escaped mr chappelow as
 always mixes a delightful blend of scientific
 truth with imagination and the result is
 always a thrilling tale

weldons idea

  government ship flew

   x he roue yesterday and
 again last night and reported
 nothing unusual we now have
 four landing fields cleared along
 the route one to every hundred
 flying miles and yesterday they
 completed the setting up of
 searchlight stations at each field
 the government ships report the
 route marked plain enough for
 safe flying so thats as far as
 it goes so far i dont think
 either of the other ships have
 been found although three planes
 of the royal air force are going
 to start an aerial search in the
 morning

if weldon doesnt get through

 


air wonder stories

 to-night ill close this base down until the mystery is cleared-
 orders or no orders theres some sort of air trap on this ran
 and im going to find out just what it is

   it wont be hard to close the field down if weldon crashes
 jim replied for there wont be a man here thatll take a
 ship up until somethings done

  well im taking every safety measure i know of to help
 him through on this run do you hear that buzzer on the wall
 both pilots listened as the intermittent sounds of a buzzer
 came to their cars from the wall over the chiefs desk at
 intervals of two or three seconds the little metal box gave
 out a short dear note

   that watson said is operated by radio signals received
 from a small automatic transmitter on weldons plane as
 long as we bear these buzzes well know at least that he is
 all right

  what good will that do tom spoke up what we should
 have done was to trail him in another ship and be nearby if
 he got into trouble
 and lose two more planes instead of one

   not necessarily-

   listen tom you have your ideas as to what is playing
 havoc on this line as well as i now im going to tell you
 fellows what my idea is and my reasons for it

  shoot was jims brief comment
 well did you fellows ever hear of skeleton valley
 sure jim again replied the line passes over it its
 a sort of cavern as seen from the air about a mile wide and
 around twenty or more long and plenty deep

 and have you ever heard any rumors about the place
 there have been yarns around that the jungle natives wont
 go near the place on account of some sort of spirit devils that
 are supposed to live in the valley offered tom but yon
 cant believe any native superstitions

   as a rule no but in this case perhaps we can

  what do you mean

  i mean that a place such as that valley miles from the
 nearest white man and shunned by the natives would be an
 excellent spot for a nest of air bandits

   great scott exclaimed jim air bandits out here

   i had that idea too tom offered these ships are carry-
 ing some valuable mail including the diamond shipments and
 payrolls between these two fields but i doubt if there could
 be much air gunning done without being seen by some natives
 and in that case the news would soon reach the settlements
 yes if they used guns but suppose our air bandits were
 scientific enough to have a ray that could demagnetize or burn
 out the generators and electrical systems of the planes then
 the ships would just naturally become paralyzed when they hit
 the beam and glide down into the valley to crash against the
 rock walls or crumple up on the floor

 the others remained silent as watson paused in his talk
 and for the space of a few minutes only the buzz-buzz
 of the little device on the wall broke the stillness then the
 chief continued

  if a man really did invent a beam of such a nature and
 determined to keep his discovery a secret and use it criminally
 to his own personal benefit then there could be no better place
 to try out such a device with minimum chances of detection
 than in skeleton valley

   it sounds reasonable all right tom agreed as far as the
 possibilities of such being done in the valley but he added
 any man inventing a beam like that would not be likely to
 use it in such a way why he could sell the rights to such
 an invention for a good fortune

   yes thats true but some men having a criminal streak in
 them would rather use their discovery the illegal way just for
 ihc excitement that it offers anyway it seems to be the most

 reasonable explanation

   it looks as though youve hit it chief jim spoke up
 everything points that way your idea would help explain
 why the boys have so many electrical troubles take weldon
 for instance it was in the skeleton valley area that he lost
 the beam and found his compass useless no doubt they tried
 to bring him down but outside of paralyzing his instruments
 they were unable for some reason to stop him then theres
 simpson his whole radio outfit went deadern a tack hammer
 in that neighborhood whether its a ray that is causing all
 this havoc or not is hard to say but it sure begins to look that
 way that would explain why nothing happens when the gov-
 ernment planesmake the run

   well those other ships went down during storms watson
 commented that would be just the time for bandits to bring
  down a plane causing the rest of the world to believe that the
 storm had forced her down

   weldon will soon be pulling up over that valley now tom
 said he cant be more than a hundred miles from her now
 im going to stick around until he gets past

   well im not figuring on leaving here for a while myself
 jim replied walking over to examine a large map of the route
 hanging on the wall

chapter ii
the story of skeleton valley

 the next moment the loud speaker of the radio set filled
 the room with its roar and the three men turned as
 one toward the instrument

   kimberley air field  hello watson the well known
 voice of weldon came from the speaker

   quickly throwing the changeover switch of the antenna to
 the transmitting side watson at once answered the call then
 switched the receiver into circuit again

   got you  k watson the pilots voice came in again
 motors are running perfectly radio reception is good and
 beam signals clear storm approaching ahead ill call you
 again chief

   didnt i tell you jim burst out as the voice ceased storm
 approaching ahead that means from the south-west an hour
 ago you would have thought looking at that sunset and clear
 sky that there would have been perfect weather all along the
 hop thats where this tropical weather gets my goat you
 start out with a clear signal and within an hour youre bucking
 the worst storm that ever hit your blades

   if he can only keep to the beam tom replied hell have
 little to fear from the storm for these greysons can outride
 anything short of a tornado

   yes but about every third storm around here is a tornado
 say chief tom turned to watson where did they get
 the name skeleton valley

   well as near as i can tell you that name started from
 reports from natives that no man or beast entering that valley
 ever returned and that the floor was practically covered with
 the bones of those caught in theft

   of course jim spoke up these yarns are exaggerated
 due to the superstitious nature of the blackies but still you
 will find that whenever they put their taboo on a place there
 is often some reason for it outside of imaginative ones
 approaching close to bad storm weldons voice came from
 the wireless receiver beam signals weak motors perfect com-
 pass is acting queer may have to leave the beam soon and
 rise above the storm 

   hello weldon watson spoke into the transmitter as he
 slapped the switch to the transmitting side keep to the guid-
 ing beam all the way if you can unless it runs through the
 core of the storm your chances are better if you stick to
 the beam and open her up full
the air trap



  got you o k chief the reply came in strong and clear
ill soon see how things look your signals are a bit weak
the storm is probably interfering with my reception am
about fifty miles from skeleton valley

  if weldon passes over the valley at a low altitude then
your air bandits if such they are will have less trouble in hear-
ing his ship go over than if he rose higher also itll put
him within easier range of their ray or other weapon tom
spoke up as the voice of the lone pilot ceased

no one replied and for a few minutes no sound was heard
in the room but the intermittent outbursts of the buzzer

  listen the sharp curt voice of the chief froze the others
in their tracks the buzzer

  it-its going jim spoke in a nervous voice

  there hear that a note of excitement rang in watsons
voice the buzzer is faltering the sounds are not clear and
sharp-they are hesitating

  the chief of the airport was right the clear musical note
of the little instrument was gradually becoming coarse and
uneven occasionally it would seem to freeze and skip a note
carrying on again with the greatest difficulty emitting split
and broken sounds in a seemingly desperate attempt to keep
going

  maybe its the buzzing device here jim offered half-
heartedly but no one replied all attention was being drawn
by the unmistakably dying sounds coming from the small
instrument on the wall

  watson was now pacing the floor of the room in a nervous
state hell never make it he muttered more to himself
than to the others hell never make it then pausing in
his tracks a moment he suddenly turned to the two pilots

  ill call him back whether he thinks he can make it or not
and not another man of mine will fly this damn line on a night
run again until we find out whats at the bottom of this some-
thing is playing havoc with our guiding beam and instruments
thats certain

  im with you on that chief roger said

  and im behind you to the last was the eager chorus of
curtiss

  the buzzer was now making attempts to continue but was
sending out only one of every five or six notes

  with alarm showing on his face watson grabbed the trans-
mitting unit and throwing the switch spoke into the mouth
piece

  hello weldon he spoke this is the chief calling an-
swer me if you hear me

  putting down the mouth piece he now changed the switch
to the reception side and the three men waited with nerves on
edge for a reply would weldons voice come through was
he still on the beam  had he reached the valley yet  such
thoughts ran through the minds of the group in the little office
of the kimberley air field as they waited with swiftly beating
hearts for a reply for a word from the lone pilot out there
fighting his way against odds over the vast expanse of storm
torn jungle

a rescue party

the musical hum of a transmitter generator came from
the speaker and three pairs of eyes were riveted on the
wireless receiver three men stood as statues facing the loud
speaking unit

  hello chief the familiar voice of the pilot broke through
a curtain of static a voice that sent the blood pounding through
the veins of the three men and brought the natural color back
to their pale cheeks i have lost the beam continued the
voice it kept weakening as i approached the valley also
my wireless receiver is out of order and i cannot receive on it
my compass is frozen tight and has a tendency to point almost
straight down and up although i have removed it from all elec-

trical instruments to make sure that they were not throwing
it out storm is unusually high and i am flying below it
there is little wind but torrents of rain i will have little
trouble in riding out this storm which is mild continuous
lightning flashes help me in keeping my bearings at present
will call you again soon and report but cannot receive for my
receiver is out

  picking up his desk phone watson spoke into the instrument
hello jake this is watson get my benson speedster ready
to go up i may need it any minute

  what now tom asked as the other hung up the phone
receiver

  just this if weldon doesnt comc through im going out
there and find out why

  it isnt your job chief if he goes down youll have lots
to do right here as the boss of this field listen watson im
ready to take the air whenever you say you can do more
than-i can by remaining here but you cant do any more than
i on a trip of this nature

  i am relief pilot this week jim spoke up so i guess that
automatically puts me in line for the job weldon is a close
side kick of mine and if he comes down im going after him
whether i get permission or not

  all right boys watson replied quietly if theres any need
of it ill let you both go but well wait for further develop-
ments

  but the buzzer has stopped altogether now protested jim
and thats enough to tell you that somethings wrong out
there besides his radio has gone bugs and the compass has
frozen on him good heavens man isnt that proof enough
that hes running into the same trap that got the other fellows 

  thats enough jim i know how you feel but under the
circumstances we must be sure of our actions before we make
a move

  the buzzer signals weakening means that his small trans-
mitter is unable to break through commented tom theres
something mighty queer about the whole thing watson

  a sound from the radio receiver silenced all parties the
next moment weldons voice came through but at a much
fainter strength than before

  approaching close to skeleton valley flying low rain
falling in torrents radio transmitter working poorly and
compass still tends to point up and down extreme left motor
missing slightly sickening feeling in the air as if some in-
visible force was sapping ones strength away

 to sooner had the set finished the message than watson
 whirled around in his chair

  get into your duds you guys youre going through and
going damn quick

  grabbing the phone he pushed a button and spoke into the
instrument

  hey cook hello  hey wheres that-hello say bring
over an emergency ration kit and step on it if its not here
in one minute youll be looking for a new job

  slamming the receiver on the hook again the airport chief
pressed another button and again lifted the earpiece

  hello jake say run the speeder out onto the field shes
going up pronto

  as he replaced the receiver the two pilots re-entered the
room buckling on their helmets and parachutes as they came

  hello --ief every man stopped dead in his tracks as the
radio spit out the words amid a rain of static they were
weak and broken transmitter working poorly hope you get
me  k left motor missing bad now-centre left-starting-
weaken am-king for landing place over the valley-feel
sick-weak-drawing my strength- the voice ceased for a
moment then continued rain coming down heavy -trcme
right-missing-only two left now will have-leave ship and
jump


air wonder stories

  again the rapidly weakening sound stopped and nothing
 could be heard but the steadily increasing static that snapped
 and crackled in the speaker making it almost impossible to
 distinguish the weak signals of the lone pilot watsons fingers
 dug into the arms of his chair as he sat motionless watching
 the radio speaking unit the pilots stood silently in their
 tracks their unbuckled straps forgotten as they waited for
 further word each man felt that the crisis had arrived that
 the next message would tell of weldons victory or of his doom

   god jim blurted out breaking the silence if we could
 only have warned him to steer clear of that val-

  chief the weak and almost unintelligible words of the
 battling mail pilot came from the speaker mingled with crash-
 ing discharges of static centre left-dead-gliding into valley
 its hell all elect-paralyzed last motor missing god shes
 stopped good-bye chief valley below-blazing inferno-val-
 ley of hell im going to leap find me in-devilish valley

                chapter iii
                into the air

   j s the voice ceased tom sprang into action

 a come on jim its our move well keep in constant
 touch with you chief and check up on the atmosphere
 as we go come on jim

  buckling on their equipment as they went the two pilots
 followed closely by their chief hurried from the little shanty
 and ran across the field towards the dark outline of the waiting
 plane reaching the ship jim at once climbed into the radio
 operators seat followed closely by his companion who took the
 controls

  is the radio equipment perfect barked watson to the
 mechanic who stood by the plane

   yes sir

   and their ration kit on board and a full supply of rockets
 and how about the machine gun and side arms

   all complete sir

   then pull air he turned to tom who was sliding his gog-
 gles down over his face and if theres a ghost of a chance
 get to weldon and bring him in

   toms reply was drowned out by the roaring of the motors as
 with no further delay he started down the field the fleet little
 speedster accelerating at a marvelous rate

   as the ship levelled off and commenced its time-defying dash
 to the south-west jim started the automatic radio signal trans-
 mitter and tested out his main transmitting and reception radio
 units finding everything in good working order he connected
 his ear and mouthpieces onto the local phone circuits by means
 of a four-pole two-way switch then spoke into the mouthpiece
 securely fastened to his helmet

   well tom we should make it in a little over an hour with
 this speed demon

   its close to two hundred miles to skeleton valley his com-
 panion replied well need an hour and a half with the wind
 against us as it is now

  if weldon was quick enough to jump clear and spread his
 sheet he probably landed safely

   if he landed in that valley he will probably be spotted by
 that gang

   then you also believe that it is the work of air bandits eh 
 i was a little doubtful until i heard his own account of
 things did you hear what he said about getting a sickening
 feeling 

   yes and what makes things more puzzling is his description
 of the valley as a blazing inferno

   probably a blinding light of some sort used to confuse the
 flyer or maybe the light of their base below

  no tom i think it was more than that weldon is a
 pretty cool guy as a rule but its plain that he was scared plenty
 when he described that valley below him i have a hunch that

 he saw something that just about scared the wits out of him

   whatever it was it is right in that valley and were going
to get at the bottom of it before we come back

  well were making good headway and the radio beam
shows no sign of weakening

   it wont until we hit the valley neighborhood thats where
it disappears and the motors go dead

ell jim spoke in reply as he swung the machine
gun around on its ball-bearing swivel and inserted the
first shell of an ammunition belt into the firing chamber if
its going to be plain aerial warfare we stand a pretty fair
chance with a speed boat like this ship but if its a ray that
theyre using which seems to be the case then-

  then cut in tom grimly the fightings going to take
place on the ground

   you said it ill bet your right hand is itching to slip the
safety catch off from your automatic

   gouds ahead and a liberal sprinkling of lightning tom
changed the subject thats the storm that just passed the
valley-the one that weldon hit well well hit it under more
favorable conditions we wont have to fight storm and valley
both at the same time

   in a few minutes the swift flyer tore into the front of the
storm as it sped across the black jungle wastes on and on
guided by the narrow radio beam sped the roaring plane rain
fell in torrents cooling off the hot stifling air and causing a
noted drop in temperature lightning cut vividly across the
black thunderheads above the ship and deafening crashes of
thunder echocd between the clouds and the dark dismal land
below the swift speed of the ship however soon put the
storm behind them and again the clear soft tropical sky with
its millions of sparkling gems looked down on the racing
machine

  jim tom spoke through the phone circuit better call
the chief and tell him that everything is  k were getting
close to the valley now better keep in touch with him con-
stantly from now on so he can check up on us dont say
anything about weldon or the valley though for someone may
be tapping in on our message get me

   k tom

   in a few minutes jim had a call sent out and almost instantly
 a reply sounded in his ears

  hello jim the chiefs voice came through i was just
about to call you your automatic signals are coming in nor-
mally and your transmitter sounds healthy how arc things

   fine chief everything working perfectly and motors are
all pulling fine just passed the storm that weldon hit over
the valley and the sky is clear ahead of us now we are now
pretty close to the valley the beam registers strong and we
are making an average of about  miles the compass so
far is  k

  very well jim now get a call through to the coast i
cant get them on my set at all if you raise them report
weldons forced descent and ask that a search ship be sent
out from there also warn them to send no more ships over
the valley they have one scheduled to leave for here at six
in the morning the telegraph line is out of order so our
only hope is the wireless

the strategy

after the signing off from the home field jim at once
 sent out the call of the capetown government wireless
station receiving no reply he tried again and again without
success

  i cant raise the coast station he informed tom and
usually theyre an easy station to get

   the valley is between us and them

   yes but itll take more than a magnetic ray to interfere
with the wireless
the air trap



  its beginning to look as if our bandits are using more than
a ray

  i dont get you

  well this may sound impossible and foolish but it appears
like theres a large magnetic field or screen spread in the air
directly between us and the coast field its likely spread right
across our route and this field is not only deflecting all radio
signals that strike it causing poor communication between you
and the coast but it is also the cause of our ships coming
down as soon as they enter this field their electrical equip-
ment which includes radio motor ignition and the guiding
beam become demagnetized or depolarized in some way while
all delicate magnetic and electric instruments such as the com-
pass become useless

  by jove tom your idea fills the bill all right from the
description given by weldon it appears as if the plane entered
a field of some sort which has only feeble effects on the appa-
ratus at first but increases as the plane gets farther into the
field but how in the mischief can any white man produce a
gigantic magnetic field like that in the air

  how can a man in wew york see whats going on in london
by means of a lot of electrical apparatus to you or me the
one seems as easy as the other only we know that the one can
be done and yet because we have never seen or heard of a
gigantic magnetic field being produced in the air we doubt the
possibility of it being accomplished

  then if theres a screen of some sort across our path how
is it that some of our ships fly the route without a quiver while
others have all kinds of trouble or disappear altogether

  because the screen or whatever this trap is is only turned
on when a ship is approaching that they want that explains
why some planes fly over the valley and do not register a single
defect in their instruments or controls

  and you think that but for this magnetic barrier across
the valley i would be able to get capetown on my radio

  it sounds reasonable doesnt it

  in a way yes but if such is the case then they must have
that field on now for i can get no radio signals from the west
at all

tphey probably have got it on look at your compass

      mine is pointing nearly west

  mine is too admitted jim but what in the mischief have
they got their net spread for now the next plane is not
scheduled to pass over the valley until the morning

  were headed that way arent we

  but you dont think-

  if the valley is a base for a ring of air bandits then you
can depend upon it they have a man at each end of this line
tipping them off as to shipments that are leaving the airports

  then you think that they are aware of our approach and
have spread the net for us

  that is ray idea only we arc not going to fall into their
trap listen jim our radio messages will likely be picked
up by this gang so call watson and tell him that you cant
get the coast also tell him that we are having trouble with
one of the rudder rods and are landing to fix it tell him
that everything else is o k and that we will resume our flight
as soon as the repairs are made also shut down the automatic
transmitter and then tell him that youve burned out a tube
and have no spare one we dont want that transmitter going
after we land because itll give the location of the ship away
also we cant shut it down without giving the chief a good
reason or hed think we had crashed like weldon and would
be tearing out here after us himself

  shutting off the automatic transmitter jim then called the
field and having concluded his conversation with the chief con-
nected himself again to the local phone circuit and resumed
his talk with tom

  i think i get your idea he said you are afraid that our

bandits will see us drop and come gunning after us is that it

  exactly but if they think that we are just going to make
a five-minute repair job then theyll just wait until we take the
air again thatll give us a chance to get away from the plane
and get located before they get curious enough to come looking
for us were close to the valley nowso well drop down and
squat in the first clearing we see keep your eyes peeled for
a parking place

chapter iv

into the valley

it was not long before a break in the jungle afforded them
the chance they wanted a stretch of clear prairie land
sufficiently large and clear as viewed from above prom-
ised a good landing place and without further delay tom
banked the ship and dropped lower

  well have to take a chance on hitting rocks or holes he
informed jim circling the plane for the final drop that
grass looks pretty high and you cant tell what its hiding

  well weve got to chance it jim replied as the ship
glided down over the jungle growth on the north edge of the
clearing but break her as quick as you can tom the less
coasting we do the better

  as he finished speaking the wheels of the ship touched the
ground rebounded settled lightly again and rolled to a smooth
stop

  a perfect field by jove jim exclaimed as he unbuckled
his helmet

  better keep your pistol handy and your eyes open tom
cautioned were not on any good-will flight to-night

  what about the machine gun wed be fools to leave it
here in the ship and bigger fools to try and lug it through five
miles of jungle to the valley

  were not much over a mile from the entrance to the valley
but even that is too far to carry the gun in this country well
ditch it in the thick brush over there near the edge of this
clearance then if we come back and find the ship taken we
will be able to make good use of it bring an extra string
of shells we may need them

  together they quickly carried the machine gun to the edge
of the clearing and in a few minutes had carefully hidden it

  take a good look at this spot tom warned we may
want to find it in a hurry on our way back here

  theres a tall dead tree with its top broken off as if it had
been hit by lightning not far west of here you can see it
for a mile for it sticks up well above the rest around it

  well then lets get going its a good mile to the entrance
of that valley and heaven knows how far away our bandits
are

  fortunately for them there was little of thick tangling under-
brush in that section of the country and they were able to
make rapid progress

  we should have given watson a hint of what we were up
to jim commented as he trailed close behind his companion
hell be worrying his head off about us when we fail to
come through on the wireless

  its better to have him worry tlian to have a committee of
air bandits waiting for us to walk into an ambush isnt it

  i guess youre right tom

  i guess wed better put a damper on our tongues before
were heard were making plenty of noise with our feet
right now

   k jim replied in a low voice

silently with eyes and cars alert the airmen approached
the clearing at the entrance to the valley pausing to rest
and reconnoitre they kept in the shadows of the trees and
looked out over the clearing before them which was flooded


air wonder stories

brightly in the rays of the moon

   the blackies were right jim when they said that no trees
 grew in the valley look out there just a clear rocky floor
 stretching as far as you can make it out between two high
 ridges of rock there is scarcely enough grass on the ground
 to cover it and not a single tree ahead of us

   tom was jims reply my compass is stuck tighter than
 the devil i cant even shake it loose

   we wont have much use for it just now so that doesnt
 matter what we want to do now is sec that your gun fingers
 dont stick weve got a clear stretch before us and not a
 straw to hide behind that means that were not going to be
 able to take them by surprise

   this place gives me the creeps why you cant even hear
 a darn cricket chirping and there isnt a sign of a bird around
 in fact there isnt a single sound to be heard outside of the
 wind

   dont worry about sounds the chances are that the night
 creatures around here heard us coming and are scared stiff
 it isnt every day that human beings are seen travelling around
 this elose to the valley listen jim weldon is in there and
 were going in after him get me

   all set tom start going there isnt a two-legged man
 that can throw a scare into me but that valley gives me the
 creeps theres something uncanny about the place

   well here goes follow close now and keep your eyes
 peeled as well as your ears

    quietly but swiftly they started out across the clearing toward
 the flat barren stretch of land running between two massive
 ridges of rock

   well head for the ridge on our right and stick close to
 it tom spoke in a low tone we may have a chance there
 of finding a notch to dive into in case we want to suddenly
 make ourselves scarce

 on up the moon-lit valley floor they pressed the rocky
 ledges getting steeper and higher as they progressed
 they were now walking on broken loose sandy dirt which
 stretched ahead as far as they could sec the moon had now
 become blanketed by clouds and darkness swept down over
 the jungle night

    god this place is creepy jim spoke in a low tone theres
 not even a weed growing here now and theres not a tree or
 a blade of grass in sight why theres not even a bug in
 the air or a creature in sight anywhere just silence dead
 nerve-racking sil-

 bank of thunderheads in the west jim was toms reply
 were in for another of these tropical storms

 tom jims voice made his companion turn with a start
 i see an object up ahead looks like it might be-

 it is jim its a plane the moons coming out again
 see the blades glittering on her in the moon-light

 well soon know whats what then jims fingers tightened
 on his pistol butt as he spoke

 keep your eyes peeled his companion cautioned as he
 hurried forward those air bandits may have a nest in these
 rocks here its about the only place for a secret hide-out
 i wish wed meet those devils and start some action im
 losing my pep tom this hiking isnt in my line

 it isnt the hiking thats doing you out remember how
 weldon felt when he came down

 you mean that-

 that we are in that mysterious magnetic field right now
 your compass will show you that much its having the same
 effect on us that it had on weldon

 then you feel it too

 i sure do and the further we pull into this valley the worse
 it is getting

 then it looks like we are approaching the source of this

 screen

   yes but if it keeps up well not be able to make it much
 farther tom replied well sec what we can discover at
 the plane anyway shes hardly a quarter of a mile away
 now

   well i dont blame the darkies for giving this place the
 taboo jim remarked as they hurried forward taking advan-
 tage of every shadow thrown by overhanging rock wgcs
 there isnt even a bug in the air and look at those white
 bones out there

 thats weldons ship jim tom remarked as he left the
 shadow of the rocks and advanced toward the centre of the
 valley the moons just gone under another cloud so nows
 our chance lets step

   quickly the two cut across the distance between the rocky
 wall and the wrecked ship taking advantage of the shadow
 cast over the barren valley floor by the clouds

   duck i tom warned his companion as they approached
 the wrecked airliner get under those broken wings the moon
 is coming out

another mystery

 a final rush and they were in the shadow of the wreck
 but none too soon for the next moment the bright rays
 of the moon reflected brightly on the floor of the valley

   well take a look around and see that were not spotted
 tom again spoke then well look her over

   tom i jim clutched his companions arm as they crouched
 in the shadow of one of the broken wings look i that white
 thing out there looks like a sheet

   god youre right jim its a parachute and weldons prob-
 ably under it look theres another cloud pulling under the
 moon and itll shade this place long enough to allow me to
 slide over to that chute now you stay here and see that no
 one creeps up on us get me

   all set tom get going and if anyone tries to get you
 ill spot him leave the rifle here and ill cover you

   again the valley was wrapped in gloomy darkness as a large
 cloud hid the moon from view tom wasted no time for run-
 ning in a stooped manner he started out toward the white
 object a short distance away

   carefully jim listened for a sound that would tell of the
 approach of another party but utter stillness prevailed in the
 valley only the sound of the wind as it swept around the
 rocky ledges high above reached his ears not a sign of the
 bandits or other life could be detected

   feeling assured that so far they had not been discovered
 jim made a quick examination of the wrecked ship his first
 thought was of the mail bags they would be gone no doubt
 but hed look anyway looking down into the badly smashed
 mail compartment an expression of surprise swept over his
 face the mail bags were still there he was instantly on
 the alert the mail was still in the ship untouched therefore
 he reasoned the bandits had not yet located the fallen ship
 he strained his eyes for a sign of anyone approaching but
 not a sound save the wind reached his ears he was aware
 of the increasingly tired feeling weakening him-overcoming
 him

   god i i wish tom would hurry he muttered to himself
 this place is getting me and if we dont soon start ill not
 be able to hold out until we get back to the plane

 he looked up at the sky as the moon-light broke through a
 small opening in the heavy cloud beneath it taking advan-
 tage of the momentary flood of light he looked across the
 valley floor toward the white parachute a small dark hud-
 dled object lay motionless half way to the white object and
 jim grasped his rifle firmly the shadow of the cloud again
 swept down over skeleton valley and he saw the dark object
 move it was tom rapidly approaching under cover of the
the air trap



 darkness in another moment the dark form of his body
 loomed up before his waiting companion

  lets get under he gasped the moons coming out in
the clear see any one

  not a damn thing tom but we soon will the mail bags
are still in the ship was that weldon out there

  yes jim it was him jim were getting the devil out of
this place while were able to go theres a storm coming
over and weve got to get out before it breaks

  but-but weldon

  hes dead jim he made a perfect landing in that chute
and hasnt a bruise on him whats more he landed in this
place alive

  are you sure

  see this small box that i brought back just now i found
it tucked under weldons arm its a diamond shipment from
one of the kimberley mines the most valuable piece of the
whole mail shipment he took the box with him when he
jumped and was able to hold it all the way down

  but how-

  lets get going jim the moon is under and weve a good
couple of miles to go before were out of this place come
on

chapter v

a desperate situation

together they made a dash across the stretch of
barren valley floor to the rocky wall that towered high
above their heads jim sank wearily to the ground as
they reached the shadows of the rock

  i dont know whats eating me tom but im just about
all in

  its this infernal valley theres a poisonous element in the
air and its sapping our strength away theres likely a deposit
of some chemical substance in this place that is causing this
thats what got weldon i tell you jim weve got to get out
of here quick id rather take a chance on running into them
bandits a dozen times than have my legs give way on me here
if we ever give in were done for because well not have
strength to get up again

  all right jim replied wearily lead away tom

  the moon had now disappeared behind the heavy thunder-
hcads that were rapidly rising a streak of lightning cut
vividly across the west and deep rolling thunder echoed and
re-echoed its solemn warning between the walls of rock

  jim theres something pretty funny about the whole affair
tom spoke as they pressed forward down the ftoor of the
cavern side by side weldon landed alive and unhurt in this
place and yet died before he could get out of his straps he
had one shoulder slipped out of his chute straps when i found
him and another ounce of energy would have been sufficient
to get him free altogether but thats as far as he got

  the storms going to break soon jim commented briefly
as he exerted all his strength to push forward

  well have to go through it jim this valley is poisonous
and itll get us if we spend much more time here thats what
got weldon im sure he was probably stunned when he
landed either by the bandits ray or in landing and this poison-
ous air got him before he regained his senses he probably
had just enough strength left when he came to to get out of
his straps

  then that explains why theres no living creatures or even
vegetation in this infernal place

  watch your foot-steps jim its pretty dark take advan-
tage of the lightning flashes to spot out the ground ahead of
you

  the rains starting the weariness of rogers voice told
of his waning strength

  tom now became fully aware of his companions condition

 andd feeling his own strength lailing fast realized the need for
 haste

  here jim lean on my arm im still feeling o k

  the rain now started to drop heavily as a loud peal of
thunder rent the air

  god a sudden exclamation from tom renewed the life
in his companion i might have known

  whats wrong

   jim i-he pointed out across the blackness that enveloped the
floor of the valley jim looked and gasped in astonishment
a glow of amber-colored mist was rising from the valley floor
in all directions as far up and down the cavern as they could
see the whole floor was glowing with that same terrible hue
close to the ground

crash i the thunder echoed down the deep ravine and a
vivid flash of lightning momentarily blotted out the glow
while the rain increased falling in torrents

  tom looked around him in horror as he assisted his weaken-
ing companion along thin tongues of fire were now leaping
upward from every sharp point and edge of rock here and
there out on the barren stretch before them small columns
and tongues of fire could now be seen shooting their amber-
colored flames up into the air as high as three or four feet
terminating in a sharp point that faded in a string of fiery
sparks

  jim i he shouted shaking his companion in an attempt to
shake him into new activity for gods sake jim were done
unless we keep going and get out quick jim i see it all now
this valley got weldon and its going to get us if we weaken
weve only a half mile to go until we hit the trees

  lets rest a minute tom pleaded rogers i-i cant
make it

  we cant stop jim we cant the rain is allowing this
stuff to leak off and the more it rains the more poisonous the
air is getting im nearly ready to go under myself but its
plain suicide to stop a single minute the rain is allowing
this stuff to leak to the surface in increasing quantities see
jim fiery sparks are now leaping from every sharp point in
the valley look turn your fingers up and you will see faint
amber beams stretching up from the tips

  feeling his own strength about to give way tom desperately
plunged on half-carrying half-dragging his almost unconscious
companion he cursed the steadily increasing orange hue and
fiery shoots that were steadily becoming longer and fiercer
he felt his breathing becoming a difficult operation and his
whole system rapidly losing all feeling and strength it was
as if the very life of his body was being sapped out by some
invisible force

  on and on they struggled heedless of the storm that raged
about them an eighth of a mile more and they would be out
of the deadly cavern but jim was now utterly exhausted he
paused in his tracks swayed dizzily and slipped silently to the
muddy ground

  jim jim tom shook him in vain the limp body of his
companion told too plainly that he was past consciousness
exerting all his strength tom picked up the still form and
with drawn distorted face made a desperate attempt to reach
the shrubbery just a few yards farther on

the answer to the mystery

step by step he shortened the distance as his breath came
in shorter and shorter gasps the whole valley behind him
was now aflame a blazing inferno but ahead the disturbance
was faint he was almost out of the area struggling blindly
on his knees quivered under the heavy burden and threatened
to give way on him but by sheer force of will power he con-
tinued his tortuous walk his arms were becoming paralyzed
and numb but there were just a few more yards to go a
vivid flash of lightning showed the line of stunted trees a short

i saw a long dirigible balloon in flight but it was not in the form of a balloon but a largo
whale sorely i was dreaming whales do not fly

ven an arctic owl becomes heavy if you carry
him far enough

  i had carried this one quite far and then quite
a bit farther i wondered if it would be safe to
take a short rest

  i glanced at the low sun and the frosty horizon there was
no sign of storm so sticking my rifle butt in a snowbank
i laid the bird down and sat down on the edge of the drift

  he was one of the most magnificent specimens of snowy owl
that  had ever seen i wondered if it would be worth while
to mount him and i wondered if his flesh would be very tough
if it were well boiled

  we were sadly in need of cliange of meat at the ship for
nearly three years now we had lived on a
very restricted diet and so when we had
sighted this great bird  but perhaps it
would be best to start at the beginning and
tell how it all came about and how we
came to be living in this whaling boat
frozen fast in the ice away in the arctic
wilderness

  in the first place i am an amateur
naturalist for the better part of my life
 have employed my spare time in fussing
around with taxidermy birds egg collec-
tions and the like

  at the time of which i am writing i
had been earning a livelihood for a number
of years as assistant examiner in the patent
office which i had found very interesting
work but on the whole too confining

  the principal redeeming feature about
my position was that it enabled me to live
near the great smithsonian institution and
national museum at washington
where i spent a great deal of
time especially in the natural
history department i took a
very keen interest in all the new
collections that were brought in
and in the expeditions that were
sent out to collect data and speci-
mens

  gradually the idea grew upon
me that it would be one of the
finest experiences of a lifetime
to be able to accompany a scien-
tific research expedition on a long
voyage but because i really was
not a scientist by education and
training i knew my qualifica-
tions were so limited that there
could be but little hope of my
ever being selected for such work

  it so happened however that
one of my old acquaintances was
elected a member of the board of
governors of the museum and through him i became more or
less familiar with the method of management and the secur-
ing of specimens for that great institution

one evening at a lodge supper he remarked that a whaling
ship had recently returned from an arctic trip and that
the had reported the capture of two gigantic blue whales
if the reports were true these whales were by far the largest
ones ever taken

  the crew reported having sighted a large number of these
monsters but having already secured a capacity load they had
lie obliged to steam away and return to port the museum
mthorities had been so interested that they had sent a repre-

sentative to examine the ships cargo and records the story
was further substantiated by interviewing a number of the
ships crew the result was that the envoy had been convinced
of the genuineness of the report

  my friend the board member believed that the ship owner
intended to send her back to the same region as soon as she
was put in repair and he felt that the museum ought to make
an ffort to have one of the big whales brought to washington
perhaps by sending a couple of naturalists to take measure-
ments and see that the catch was properly preserved

  i was very much interested in the project and the next time
i met the board member i asked if there were any developments

we have made some progress we have
  submitted a proposition to the owners and
  they have considered it favorably we have
  offered to provision the boat for the voy-
  age furnishing all necessary auxiliary
  equipment and to send two representa-
  tives to protect our interests the conditions
  being that the ship shall continue the search
  for three years or until a suitable speci-
  men is taken

  the chief difficulty he went on is
  to find some one of proper qualifications
  who is willing to rough it and endure the
  hardships of such a voyage you know
  the circumpolar regions are very uninvit-
  ing i had thought of offering the position
  to you he finished jokingly

  thats a good egg  replied i had
  thought seriously of suggesting that very

  you wouldnt give up your good posi-
tion to go on a skylarking expedition like
that would you he asked in-
credulously

  well yes he said at length
wouldnt have to give up my po-
sition permanently since the
museum is a semi-government in-
stitution perhaps i could get
leave of absence

  aboard the marazion

y friend looked at me long
and gravely before he spoke
well yeshe said at length
i suppose you are to some ex-
tent qualified what with your
taxidermy and other hobbies but
you have no diplomas or degrees
or what not to show the board
that you have special qualifica-
tions

  well i countered neither
did darwin have any diplomas
or degrees to show that he was
a qualified naturalist or geologist when he was appointed to go
on the famous voyage of the beagle what he did have how-
ever was some very good friends and since you are on the
board i am going to put in a few days hoping

  well he said i will think it over but i want you to
do some serious thinking too such a voyage is no joke

  i need not dwell on the happenings of the next few months
suffice it to say that some three months later one bright june
morning i went aboard the marasion with baggage prepared
to sail the seas from the aurora borealis to the aurora
australis if need be to capture a blue goliath

   northern lights

    southern lights

air wonder stories

   captain baker a round-bodied round-faced man welcomed-
 me with enthusiasm

   he had been in charge of the former expedition of the
 marasion and he expressed the greatest confidence that we
 would be able to find and capture one of the monster whales

   the thompson chemical company delivered your preserv-
 ing alcohol and a lot of other stuff capt baker said there
 is a large bottle marked acid you must be going to start
 a drug store somewhere

   i only intended to order three pints of the acid perhaps
 they have made a mistake i will look at my carbon copy of
 the order so saying i fished out the order and ran my eye
 down the items

   yes here it is hydrochloric acid but to my consternation
 instead of three pints it was written three gallons

   well anyway it is stowed under twenty-five tons of other
 junk now said the captain so we had better let it ride

   my co-worker the other representative of the museum
 officially designated as my assistant soon arrived a red-headed
 agrecably-mannered young man fresh from college

   i brought along quite a large box of books he announced
 apologetically i hope you wont mind my taking them along
 if we can find room for them you see i intend to bone up
 on the sciences i might get to be a naturalist or something

   i guess we can find room for them in the glory hole said
 the captain but i warn you that they will smell of whale
 blubber to all eternity

 the mate proved to be a giant norwegian his hands
 were the largest human hands i had ever seen and his
 jovial voice even in ordinary conversation bellowed and rever-
 berated with such force that he always seemed more like some
 fabled giant of mystical lore than a real person

   the ship was equipped with three whale boats one was
 quite a large launch equipped with a powerful marine engine
 and a very modern harpoon gun the other two were very
 small boats scarcely larger than a rowboat equipped with
 very light motors

   the ship itself was one of the most modern in the whaling
 industry having an electric light plant and the most modern
 of whale-handling machinery

   there was no ceremony about our departure when every-
 body was aboard we simply shoved off from the little quay
 and steamed out to sea

   the first few days out were quite uneventful my assistant
 willard became deathly seasick and it fell to my lot there
 being no doctor or stewards on board to act in the capacity
 of both

   after perhaps a fortnight we arrived on the outskirts of
 the feeding ground of the whales but as there were no whales
 in sight we kept on always traveling in a northerly direction

   in order to save coal we now hoisted sail and continued our
 northward journey in long zigzag tracks

   not long after this we sighted our first whale and wiliard
 and i were treated to our first sight of a whaling crew in
 action the mate taking command of the motor boat and
 directing the attack

   the scene proved to be a very exciting one for us and the
 whale was finally successfully harpooned and captured

   he was only a small fellow and soon the valuable parts of
 his carcass were stored in our hold and we were again on our
 way to the north

   during the working up of the whale willard and i were
 much interested in searching out and examining the vestigial
 bones which arc the last remains of the whales hind legs they
 are the survivals of the time when it was a land animal and
 vwalked about the swamps and marshes foraging for tender
 reeds or tall rushes and having no thought of the time when
 the land should rise so high as to dissipate the swamps and
 deposit the glaciers of an ice age in their place and leave the

 poor whale no alternative but to take to the water or perish

   we were also much interested in the food substances taken
from the great stomach all the whalebone whales and this
was one of that description-live entirely on plankton which
they find floating in vast fields on or near the surface of the
sea

   plankton is made up of vegetable matter such as diatoms
together withjjlue-green algae with a liberal mixture of minute
animals mostly protozoa and a seasoning of fish eggs and
many kinds of larvae

   these the whale scoops up in his great mouth together with
much sea water upon closing his mouth the water is strained
through the fine whalebone fibres and the plankton retained
while the water is discarded

                 chapter ii
                 a killing

the biggest whales live the farthest north the captain
assured us they like cold water the colder the better
so we kept on day after day till we were far within
the arctic circle

  at length the captain announced that we were passing
through the waters where the great whales were captured on
the former voyage

   but the days passed and no whales were sighted

   they must be still farther north said captain baker and
so we continued poleward

   we now commenced to encounter large quantities of floating
ice and the weather grew bitterly cold

  at last just as we were about to turn back two whales
were sighted in the distance and the ship gave chase

  the animals were traveling in a northerly direction and
except once when they stopped to feed on floating plankton
they were forging right along

   but we gained on them quite steadily and were within less
than a mile of them when to our great disgust the point of
an ice floe drifted between us and them we were therefore
obliged to change our course and steam out around the end of
the moving mass

  the whales had in the meantime traveled several miles on
their course

   they kept to the open water however and by dint of liberal
stoking we were soon near enough to make the attack by motor
boat

   willard was eager to take to the boat with the crew but the
captain objected saying that a little boat which the slightest
mishap might capsize was no place for a land lubber

  in breathless suspense we watched the boat approach the
largest of the whales

   it was a sight long to be remembered the giant mate stood
at the harpoon gun directing the management of the boat in
a voice that came booming back to us over the crests of the
ocean swells the swells lifted the boat high in air and then
sent it careening down the side of a deep trough only to
hesitate a moment before being lifted again to another crest
it did not seem possible that one could aim or fire a gun
accurately from such an unstable craft especially in a sea of
such great power

at times the great bodies of the whales were completely
 submerged then again a portion of a long back with a
small fin would protrude above the surface amid a swirl of
foam or a trough between the waves would reveal a vast ex-
panse of a bluish grey gliding body or maybe a great back
would hump up in a ponderous curve then the long posterior
portion of the great length would flow-flow is the only word
for it-in a sounding maneuver the unseen head perhaps search-
ing the depths for some special plankton the great flukes of
the arctic rescue



   the tail waving in their capacity of propeller in following the
   curve of the course would be flung high in the air only to
   dcscend quickly into the waves

     willard compared this tail gesture with the futile racing of
   the propeller of an outboard motor when a wave lifts the
   stern of the boat clear of the water

     the bulk of the whale was so gigantic while the little boat
   with its crew was so puny it seemed impossible that there
   could be any danger to the huge beast

    but i was reassured by the thought that the microbes and
   bacilli that often slay us humans are so small as to be almost
   invisible

    with bated breath we measured the distance from the boat
   to the whale until it seemed as though the mate must be intent
   on driving the boat itself instead of the harpoon into the
   animals great side

    then we saw the boat mount to the very top of a passing
   wave as it hung poised for an instant on the crest a short
   line of blue-white smoke shot toward the whale and a moment
   later the quick sharp detonation of the harpoon gun rang out
   over the sea

     the great tail flukes lashed the water to foam and the whale
   shot forward with tremendous speed we saw the coils of
   the harpoon line leap into the air and straighten out

    then a muffled thud seemed to come from nowhere in par-
   ticular just as the whale bounded with a mighty flourish of
   his spreading flukes high in the air

    that was explosive in the harpoon they have made a fair
   hit said the captain excitedly he is our meat

    speedily we were under way and the little boat was coming
   to meet us paying out the great coil of rope as it came

    a line was dropped overboard and the whale line quickly
   snatched up and attached to the forward winch

    the captain was now too busy giving orders to answer any
   questions but as the huge mate appeared over the side willard
   had this one for him

    do you think the whale is dead

    yes dead as a mackerel lie answered confidently and
   so it proved

     as the winch got to work the line came steadily reeling in
   as if dragging a dead load and soon we saw the dark carcass
   approaching the side

    as it broke water alongside it assumed unbelievably huge
   proportions

     that is at least a whale and a half said the captain the
old museum will have to build on an addition in order to
 house him

     indeed it seemed as though such would be the case for this
   monster of the deep so far outran our previous conceptions
   of great mammals that we could scarcely credit our eyes

    as we gazed in pop-eyed astonishment the sailors were busy
   making the huge carcass fast alongside for any attempt to hoist
   such a leviathan on deck was obviously out of the question

    stout nets were brought up from below and spread under
   the whale to insure it against the onslaughts of sharks or killer
   whales after having first inflated the carcass with air

    and now for the first time since putting out the boat we
   took thought of our surroundings

ice-bound

   to the south of us the ice floe we had earlier encountered
   had assumed startling proportions its white expanse
   stretched away almost endlessly and its eastern border which
   we had rounded in our pursuit of the whales a few hours
   earlier was merging with a previously unnoticed pack drifting
   down from the north thus all chance of returning the way
   we had come was cut off

    to make matters worse a blinding snowstorm came driving
   down from the pole and the seething sea now bitterly black
   in contrast with the pelting snow assumed an angry aspect

     

  there seemed to be nothing to do but turn the ships prow
northward and bucking the storm to make our way around
one or the other of the converging ice floes

  in the evening the wind died down but in the morning it
rose again with greatly increased fury this time from the
southwest

  we were now in a very narrow lane running almost due
north and south and in order to prevent the quartering gale
from driving us into the ice pack we were obliged to keep under
way with full steam ahead

  for two days we kept  at high speed searching the sur-
face of the sea all the time with the binoculars for dear water

  at length becoming alarmed lest we should penetrate so
far into the polar regions that we would never be able to extri-
cate ourselves we decided to turn back and retrace our course
hoping that somewhere the sea might have cleared behind us
but we soon found our way blocked and were forced to turn
north again

  toward evening of the fifth day the wind died down but
at the same time the ice closed in around the ship so firmly
that it blocked all progress

  the next morning the heaving ocean was gone and all
about us was one vast field of dead motionless snow and ice
the ship and the great whale were firmly fixed in the ice and
deeply rifted with snow

  we were a glum and discouraged little band that busied
ourselves shoveling snow all the morning while the captain
took bearings and tried to locate our position

  from our deductions we find that we are perilously far
north the captain reported in fact a long way further than
we had suspected

what hope

our only hope of release was that a mild turn of the
weather or a great storm might sooner or later open
to warmer seas the path through which we had arrived

  uneventful cold and miserable were the weeks and months
that followed

  although our ship had been liberally stored with blankets
and clothing and although we had bought a few raw furs
where we had touched the coast of labrador we were yet
pitifully supplied for the rigors of the long dark arctic winter
that would shortly be upon us

  apparently there was no game to be had and although there
might be fish in the deep waters far beneath us there seemed
little hope of catching them

  under the captains direction we set to work to cut up
blankets and fashion them into red suits of underwear under
trousers and outer garments

  the giant mate busied himself for long hours constructing
a heating stove from sheet metal and various odds and ends

  this heater was designed with the help of a little precious
coal to burn strips of blubber and whale fat and if one
could bring himself to overlook a certain amount of smoke and
fumes together with an unbelievably rank odor the mates
efforts may be said to have been successful

  as winter set in we fell into fairly routine habits the
morning was given over to such work as was necessary about
the ship preparing food making additional clothing and various
other chores while the latter part of the day-if one could
call those dark stretches days-was free for each man to do
as he liked

  at such times the officers and men usually devoted them-
selves to card playing and checkers while willard and i read
the technical books that he had so providentially brought along
or held long discussions about many things more or less
scientific

  we racked our brains and searched all our books for knowl-
edge of radio but we found somewhat to our surprise and
chagrin that neither of us knew anything of practical value

v


air wonder stories

nor could we find any aid in the books if we could have built
a sending set we could no doubt have broadcast our predica-
ment and position to the world and have stood a good chance
of being speedily rescued

   or if we could have rigged up a receiving set we could at
least have relieved the miserable monotony of our lives by pick-
ing up programs from the super-power stations

   we reproached ourselves most bitterly for having set out
on such a voyage without giving a thought to learning the rudi-
ments of a science that would have been of inestimable value
in our emergency

  here we had books on chemistry entomology comparative
anatomy geology and various other subjects but nothing on
the one important science that we needed

chapter iii

the coining of day

during those long winter evenings we had ample time
to discuss our predicament and lay plans for the com-
ing of the brief summer

  at times the consensus of opinion seemed to be that we
ought to abandon ship and try to make our way to land and
thence back to civilization as soon as the rising sun should
make such a course possible

   at other times there seemed to be a general disposition to
stick to the ship and trust that sooner or later a way would
be cleared to the open sea

   we had no adequate idea of how far it might be to the near-
est land or in what direction it might lie for we were a
long way from the most northern grounds that we had intended
to visit and the charts and maps of a whaling vessel are ordi-
narily very sketchy and inadequate as-regards land formations
in partially explored districts ours were no exception

   however as the long period of darkness drew to a close
we laid definite plans for sending out exploring and rcconnoitcr-
ing expeditions and the giant mate set to work to improvise
a couple of ice sledges while other members of the crew
strove to produce various parts of the necessary equipment
such as sled harness and poles

   it was finally determined to divide the men into two equal
parties one of which should stay with the ship prepared for
the breaking up of the ice or any other emergency while the
others should go forth to explore  a trip calculated to take
not more than a week at most always making a rough chart
of their route and keeping an eye open for any possibility of
fish or game

   at the first peep of the sun over the southern horizon i set
off with the rest of the party laden with provisions guns a
mariners compass and one pair of the ships binoculars be-
cause i had appeared somewhat apt with the pencil i had been
chosen as official routc-charter for the expedition

   i will pass over the events of this expedition and several
similar ones of the following weeks because they were quite
unproductive of any tangible results except as they revealed
the fact that we were in the midst of a vast area of unbroken
ice and snow and that there was no land or open water within
a radius of at least a hundred miles i

if the weather was too stormy the men often suffered severely
from exposure and frost-bite and if it was fair and clear
they often suffered from snowblindness since we had only
three pairs of colored glasses and one pair of ordinary spec-
tacles which we smoked

   at last near the close of the season and after a great storm
 an exploring party reported seeing a lane of open water several
 miles away to the west of our position

   great excitement prevailed and hope ran high that the lead
would spread in our direction and release us from our bondage

but nothing of the sort happened on the contrary scouts

sent to watch developments reported that the lane was growing
narrower and freezing over again at the near end

  some of the men and especially the giant mate grew quite
desperate in the face of this disappointment and declared for
taking one of the two small boats and making a dash for the
open sea it was evident that this was going to be the last
chance of the year

  the captain demurred saying that one of the small boats
could not be expected to live out the rough seas and besides
it could not carry water and provisions for more than two or
three days but he agreed that if the large whaling boat could
be transported to open water he would consent to allow at
least a part of the men to make the attempt although it seemed
nothing short of foolhardy

  holvever the distance was so great and the boat was so
heavy that it appeared like an almost impossible portage but
the giant mate whose optimism and good nature rose superior
to every obstacle declared that the boat should go if he had
to carry it on his shoulders

   he ordered the fire started in the forge and all the steel rod
 harpoon stock brought up from the hold then with the help
 of the blacksmith and the carpenter he set to work to fashion
 steel-shod sleigh runners for the bottom of the boat he de-
 tailed other men to erect a mast everyone joined in the work
 with the desperation of hope long deferred

the decision

at the end of twenty-four hours during which everybody
 had worked frantically the ice ship was rigged with
sail and runners and was ready for the journey the cook
prepared a hearty meal and we prepared to turn in for my
part i was so exhausted that rest seemed impossible

  then the question arose who should go and who should stay 
the captain declared that his place was with the ship but
that any inclined to brave the hardship of a voyage in an
open boat in an arctic sea were at liberty to do so

  willard and i held a conference all day i had been un-
decided whether to join the desperate party or stay with the
ship on a chance of future deliverance

  willard seemed quite decided

  let us not desert the whale he said we might never be
able to get such another giant specimen and think what would
be lost to the world especially to our museum

  this may be our last chance i argued when the whal-
ing boat is gone-if indeed it does go which i very much
doubt-there will be no possibility of our leaving the ship by
way of water and we might be imprisoned here until we die
our supplies cannot last forever are you willing to give up
a chance for life just for the sake of an overgrown whale

  well he answered stoutly scientists have given their
lives for far less

  all right willard i said holding out my hand we stay
with the whale

  some half dozen of the men had already declared their
intention of going

  although so much had been accomplished the mate was not
ready to call it a day he had decided to take a part of the
food supplies and gasoline on ahead by sledge and leave them
at some point near a possible launching place he called for
volunteers to go with him while the rest slept
after some hesitation two men offered to go and shortly 
afterward they set off with two sledge loads the great mate
in the lead hauling one sledge and the two sailors following
tugging at the other load

some distance away the mate turned and shouted back
at the ship in his bull-like voice

go to sleep boys and ask the mercy of hell for wind 

  we did go to sleep and were awakened some hours later
by the voice of the returning mate
the arctic rescue



get up he bawled and load some more grub and some
hooch on the old slide wagon and get the sail ready

he dropped into a bunk without even removing his mittens
or boots and in a moment was fast asleep

half an hour later his two volunteer helpers came trudging
wearily in

with his great strides the mate had far outstripped them
on the homeward journey leaving them far in the rear

we ate a hasty breakfast and under the captains orders
started to load the rest of the equipment on the boat all
except two sledge loads which were to be transported separately

before the job was near completion the mate was up and
lending his great strength to the work in hand

i am giving you half thj gasoline said the captain i
think that is all you ought to try to carry

thats plenty said the mate anyway we will throw
in one of those -inch planks i will make an oar that will
bring us into boston harbor

every one was cheerful as the last preparations for depar-
ture were made the wind was fresh and from the right direc-
tion the sky was clear

when all was ready the captain and one man took stations
in the boat to jiandle the sail and we attempted to push off
but the iron runners were frozen to the ice and would not
budge

bars were quickly brought and the runners pried loose to
everybodys relief the boat started to slide over the ice the
sail filled and with a great shout from the men we were ofy

 at first the craft didnt seem very difficult to push in fact
 where the ice was hard and smooth the sail gave almost suffi-
 cient motive power

for two hours all went well nearly half the distance to the
open rift had been covered when we struck rougher going
and our troubles began

the narrow runners bit more deeply into the snow and ice
only by main strength could we make any progress

as time passed and we labored on mile after mile our
strength began to fail but we dared not stop for fear that
the wind would die down or that the weather would suddenly
turn colder and close up the lane of open water

to open water

the tireless mate was in the lead with a rope attached
to the bow of the boat with this he guided the course
of the craft to avoid the rougher places and patches of deep
snow

occasionally we would encounter an especially deep hole or
some unavoidable obstacle and come to a dead stop from which
we were unable to budge

then the leader would drop the rope and hurry back to help
us push

now all together he would say and putting his great
shoulder to the load he would give a prodigious heave and the
boat would move forward

once we encountered a wide crevasse that was bridged over
with a thin covering of ice and snow one of the runners
broke through and nearly capsized the boat

here we had to unload everything that could be unloaded
and pry the runner up to get it again on firm footing

then as we were within a mile of the open water we came
to a great pressure ridge of broken ice as we drew near it
loomed across our path a vast white barrier

the now exhausted men were dismayed and disheartened at
the sight but the mate hastened to reassure them

keep your tails up he roared i will kick it over when we
get there i

we had two axes with us one a huge blade with an extra
long handle

snatching up the big axe the mate attacked the ice barrier
with demonic frenzy that sent huge chunks of ice flying in all

directions and cheered us on someone grabbed the other axe
and with bars and harpoons we all fell to

  after an hours hard work when much ice had been cleared
away the huge man halted and mopped the sweat from his
forehead

  we will chop away the worst of it he said and then
use a dead man and the harpoon winch to pull us over the
rest

  he detailed a couple of men to dig a deep hole in the level
ice beyond the barrier and place the one plank for an anchor

  the boats gine was tuned up and the harpoon cable strung
out to lend mechanical aid

  as the crew broke through the crest of the ridge the sight
of water in the distance heartened them and they worked with
renewed energy when the worst of the ice was cleared away
we prepared for the great effort

  everything movable having been again removed from the
boat the harpoon cable was made fast to the dead man and
the winch operated till the cable came taut

we took our places and began to push with a roar the
engine went into high speed and in a wild scramble and
rush we started up the indinc

  we were almost at the crest when the engine gave a cough
and died

  you guys jump on the rope and i will push her over
shouted the mate

  we ran to the bow and leaping into the air caught the taut
cable and teetered up and down on it in unison indomitable
as his viking ancestors the norseman bent his back to the load
for a supreme effort

  the boat lurched forward and slid tobogganwise down the
hill

  the more than twenty hours of grueling toil were now for-
gotten as we pulled and toted to bring the unloaded impedi-
menta and reload the boat

  as we set the sail and pressed on we found the going good
and were soon at the waters edge where we halted and re-
moved the sleigh runners in preparation for embarkation

  it was then that it dawned on me that the entire crew had
elected to go and that only the captain wjllard and myself
were to remain

                chapter iv
                an owl

when the boat was finally in the water and i saw all
the men going aboard i must admit that i felt like
giving over my resolution and going along but the
boat was already heavily loaded besides was i to have less
stamina than my assistant and refuse to stick to our prize

  so the boat pulled out and left us a forlorn shivering little
 trio standing on the ice gazing after it

  we saw the mate standing in the bow he waved farewell
with one of those enormous hands and his great jovial voice
came back over the waves

  we dont know where were going but were on our way
he called we gave an answering shout and turned wearily
back toward the ship

  the prospect of a long march in the face of a biting wind
was very disheartening but we bent our bodies forward and
trudged on mile after mile silently and painfully each of us
busy with his own thoughts

  at last we gained the ship and the rest of which we were
in such desperate need

  we had nothing to do but settle down to wait hoping that
the little boat in some miraculous manner might survive the
perils of the great ocean and eventually reach port and report
our predicament to those who might be able to aid us

  then too we still had hope that some time this part of the


air wonder stories

occan might again become liquid as we had once seen it in
which case although very shorthanded we might be able to
navigate the ship

  however another long dark winter was soon upon us and
we dropped back into our old habits until spring or rather
until the reappearance of the sun for in that frozen region
there was no season that by any stretch of the imagination
could be called spring

  the light months came bringing no sign of an ice break-up
nor of help from outside we began to despair of the safety
of our late shipmates

  as time wore on we eventually became very low-spirited
although we were in no immediate need of either food or
fuel we still had a goodly supply of coal f large quantity
of blubber and whale oil and also had a fair supply of groceries
and tinned foods and in our prize whale almost an inex-
haustible supply of meat

  even when the crew was still with us we had burrowed into
the vast cold storage carcass and taken out large quantities
of the meat

  this meat we found surprisingly tender and palatable con-
sidering the size of the great animal

one bright day-it was now late summer-i was standing
on deck scanning the surrounding ice fields for signs
of a rapture when i saw a dark shadow skimming over the
white surface manifestly it must be the shadow of a bird
in flight but at first i could see no bird

  i puzzled over that for a moment then it dawned on me
that it must be a perfectly white bird and hence invisible
against the white background

  instantly i recalled how i had seen many little creatures
in shallow tropical waters that were so nearly the color of the
water itself as to be practically invisible then the bird in its
flight rose above the horizon and i saw clearly outlined a
great arctic owl

  needless to say this was a great event for i had been with-
out sight of bird or beast for three years

  in great excitement i called to willard and the captain
who came hurrying up from the galley and when told of the
presence of the bird joined in my excitement

  with straining eyes we followed the course of his flight
until lie settled low over a ridge in the far distance and dis-
appeared

  focussing the telescope on the spot where he had disappeared
we perceived that he had alighted and was perched among
some pressure-jumbled blocks of ice

  in spite of my companions protests that the wary bird would
see me and fly off when i was still far away i determined to
try to bag him

  taking my gun and my dark glasses to ward off snow-
blindness i set out actuated by the oldest of all human emo-
tions the instinct of the hunter

  so eager was i in my adventure that i paid little heed to
the many treacherous crevasses that experience had taught me
must intersect my path and i was only brought to ray proper
senses by a bad fall and a narrow escape from tumbling into
a deep snow-bridged crack that would have meant total disaster

  thoroughly frightened but still intent on my purpose i
proceeded more circumspectly and on a circuitous route calcu-
lated to bring me close to the pressure ridge on which the bird
was perched

  cautiously i crept along among the larger pieces until i
was but a hundred yards from the great bird

  then i had the misfortune to stumble into plain sight in-
stantly he spread his powerful wings and took to the air

  i hesitated only long enough to take careful aim and fired
to my delight and i might almost say surprise-for owls are
proverbially hard to kill-he came tumbling to earth

  i ran up prepared to dispatch him if necessary with another

shot but he was stone dead

the great ideal

from the direction of the ship came the sound of two
shots fired in rapid succession indicating that willard and
the captain had been observing my prowess

   i shouldered the bird with a greater sense of exhilaration
than i had felt for a great many weeks and started the home-
ward trek

   at first i walked quite rapidly and with little effort but
i soon encountered some formidable crevasses and was forced
to make several detours by the time i was half way back
to the ship i commenced to feel the strain occasioned by the
bad going and my decision to unload the bird and the gun for
a short rest brings us back to the opening of this story

   i removed one glove and stroked the glossy feathers of the
owl how thick and smooth they seemed i that wonderful
smoothness was like something i had felt years ago a mo-
ments reflection sufficed to recall-it was the smoothness of
the rear end of the tote poles the indians used when i was a
boy on the western plains many miles of sliding through
the buffalo grass gave just that absolutely smooth polish i
remembered how cumbersome a load an indian pony or for
the want of a pony an indian squaw could pull across the
prairie

  well here was a thought why not drag the great bird
over the snow  with such an opportunity as this there seemed
no logical reason why i should carry him

  i remembered having a string in my pocket i felt for it
yes it was there a strong piece of fish cord i brought it
out and throwing one glove down to protect my knee from the
snow knelt beside the bird and proceeded to make a knot about
his neck then fearing that the cord would injure the feathers
i brought from an inner pocket a portion of a blue bandana
handkerchief and inserted it under the cord

   how much i wondered could the live bird have carried on
such a string while in flight i thought of the weight that an
airplane could carry then of the load of a balloon

   then as little pictures sometimes float through the mind
just before we go to sleep i saw a long dirigible balloon in
flight it was close down to the horizon scarce clearing the
pressure ridges it passed by a little cloud and emerged but
now it was not the form of a balloon but that of a large whale i

   with a start i strove to collect my senses surely i was
dreaming whales did not fly besides i was not looking
about me but down at the great owl could it be that i was
freezing and dropping to sleep as men do when they are over-
come by cold and fatigue

  had i been unconscious of the passage of time and become
chilled unawares

i leaped to my feet and swung my arms and beat my
chest i found i had no numbness in my hands or feet
and my limbs were not stiff

   surely i must have been the victim of an hallucination but
why should i visualize a whale in flight above this expanse
of ice and snow

  well perhaps i had been thinking a great deal about our
giant whale having little else to occupy my thoughts for many
months besides after several years of seeing nothing but this
encircling vastness one could not be expected to keep the old
time grip on his mental reactions

  and yet after all i thought as i put on my glove and
made a hand loop in the string a dirigible does very much
resemble a whale they are of much the same shape and
both have steering fins and tail flukes

   if only our giant were a dirigible instead of a dead whale
how gladly would we sail back to gods country

   and then the important thing happened

one eminent scientist has said that perhaps the greatest
the arctic rescue



miracle of all natures wonders is the birth of a thought

  the whale would make a good balloon would it

  i spoke half aloud while my thoughts flew feverishly on to
consider details of lifting gas motive power and navigating
instruments

  yes it might really be possible here at last was hope i i
was conscious of a great glow of excitement my heart was
beating furiously and i felt the hot blood rushing up my netk
to my brain

  i was spurred to action the first thing was to tell my com-
rades about it

   snatched up my gun and ran for the ship trailing the owl
behind me

  presently i slowed down to a brisk walk for i saw the ship
in the distance and on the deck i thought i could make out
the forms of willard and the captain looking at me through
the glasses it struck me that i must present rather an incon-
gruous spectacle

  what would they think of me capering along and dragging
the bird behind me would they think me demented

  really if they did it would be deuced awkward especially
since the idea which i had to propose to them was at best quite
extraordinary it would be an awkward situation indeed if
they should become convinced tliat i was mentally deranged
and that my brilliant plan was only the ravings of a maniac

  i went back over the happenings of the last few days scru-
tinizing my actions to see if there could have been anything
about my conduct that could have seemed queer happily i
could think of nothing out of the ordinary

  however i resolved that i would not spring my idea upon
them until any false impressions that they might have received
should have had time to pass off

  at least it would be best to wait a day or two and think it
over so as to prepare a logical presentation of the subject in
the meantime perhaps i could lead the talk to dirigibles and
maybe suggest the thought without actually putting it into
words

  i decided that the best course for the present would be to
evince a great enthusiasm for my rare specimen of owl and
indulge in a bit of good humor and high spirits as a sort of
celebration of my good luck

chapter v

the launching of the idea

to my relief upon arriving i iound both the captain and
willard intensely interested in the bird after laughing
good-naturedly at my unique method of transportation
willard true to his naturalistic instincts was interested in the
catch as a specimen of the fauna of the far north and the
captain was interested in its possibilities as fresh meat

  willard and i set to work to remove the skin and portions
of use to the taxidermist while the captain put the pot on to
boil with a pinch of cooking soda in the water

  the following day as we sat at dinner the conversation was
about dirigible balloons how high they could fly how much
wind they could stand and so on

  do you know i observed that the ideal shape for a
balloon would be to copy the form of a whale in fact i
believe that if they would cover a whales body with balloon
cloth in order to get the pattern and then take it off and
insert the framework and divide it into several compartments
they would have the most manageable craft possible to
construct

  how would it be to just inflate a whale with gas the
captain asked laughing

 i did not laugh at the joke i was observing willard his
face lit with a fleeting smile then suddenly he became sober
and preoccupied he stared at his plate he seemed to be
swallowing with effort

  got a bone in your throat asked the captain

  no said willard at length but i was just thinking
there might be some sense to this idea of using a whale for
a dirigible

  the captain looked puzzled

  you dont really mean that seriously do you he queried

  well why not said willard we have a whaleskin for
a bag boat motors and gasoline for power plenty of whale-
bone for the what-you-may-call-its-

  i believe its an idea i what do you think of it  the cap-
tain asked looking at me

  i have understood that a large quantity of gas was one of
the prime essentials for balloon operation i replied without
any seeming enthusiasm

  the captain seemed not altogether incredulous you scien-
tists ought to be able to make gas out of something on board
he observed

  and so the venture was launched not that we actually
began work but we began to study to plan and experiment

a few days later we went out with shovels and uncov-
ered the portion of the whales carcass that was above the
ice and took measurements to determine the cubic feet of gas
space that could be made available

  our deductions were quite satisfactory and encouraging
there was surely room for a tremendous volume of gas

  but the work of removing the whales interior bulk seemed
a task of such colossal proportions that the captain demurred
it would take the three of us years working every day to do
that job he argued

  well how much is our time worth asked willard so
far as we know we have nothing else of importance to do
during the rest of our natural lives and a job like this will
at least give us something to occupy our minds and perhaps
preserve our sanity

  it was not the first time that one of us had spoken of the
preservation of our mental equilibrium and i felt that we were
all more or less conscious that there was danger of our sharing
the fate that often overtakes marooned sailors and explorers

  but the next thing to consider before we let our hopes soar
too high was could we find a way to produce hydrogen gas
we set to work in earnest to discover a way of producing the
necessary gas

  willard and i had had a vague notion from the first that by
electrolysis of sea water something might be accomplished

  we had the dynamo for generating electricity for our light-
ing system and for the motor to our high-speed winch but
our chemical equipment was discouragingly meagre

  fortunately among willards books was one entitled the
chemistry of industry here we found a short article on
hydrogen from electrolysis of water

  from this we gathered that an electric current passed through
a solution of water and salt by the aid of a trace of some
acid catalytic agent such as hydrochloric acid would produce
hydrogen in generous amounts

  for our purpose it was necessary to have a large u-shaped
container in order to get the proper circulation of the electric
current and this container had to be impervious to the acid
used

  willard and the captain set about building such a container
from sheets of metal carried in stock for repairing and renew-
ing blubber reducing vats insulating it with several coats of
high grade varnish which i had brought along for preserving
specimens

  as for hydrochloric acid we had recourse to the huge bottle
that a fortunate error had bestowed upon us

the work goes on

in the meantime i proceeded to dig a well i will venture
to say that when it was completed it was the only well in


air wonder stories

the ocean then in use

  since the ice that forms on salt water is practically free
from salt-containing only one fifth of the original salt-
we knew that melting the ice so abundant all around us would
not produce the brine we needed

  the ice was not so deep as i had anticipated and at the
end of the second day  had at our disposal a limitless supply
of both salt and water in a pukka well all rigged with a wind-
lass for hauling up buckets and a battering ram for breaking
the ice as often as it tormed on the surface of the water

  more than a month was consumed in perfecting apparatus
and experimenting on the production of gas but after much
toil and many discouragements we finally succeeded in con-
structing a device which although not very efficient was
capable of producing a small volume of hydrogen gas that
would float improvised paper balloons

  and now we were ready for the great task of separating
mr whale from his skin

   it was decided to excavate the remainder of the flesh blubber
and bones by a process of mining most of the blubber we
intended to bum in our boilers to furnish power for the
generator

  fortunately we had a goodly supply of tools and we set
to work with a will but we soon found that our muscles
were soft and we were in poor condition for such exhausting
manual labor however since there were no time limits on
our operations we could work only a few hours a day gradu-
ally increasing the length of our forenoon and afternoon shifts

  the method adopted was to leave a wall of several inches
of the frozen blubber all around the outside so that the sur-
face would remain rigid until the major part of the material
had been removed then to go over the entire surface again
very carefully removing all the blubber and leaving only the
thin skin putting in struts and props the while so that the
structure would not collapse with its own weight

  before starting this last process we spent several weeks
chopping the ice away from the carcass and introducing a
layer of cinders and ashes beneath it to prevent its adhering
to its support

  the weeks lengthened into months while we were still en-
gaged in this work but as our muscles hardened and the
project developed our spirits improved and we no longer
scrutinized ourselves and each other for signs of dawning
insanity it was evident that the game was worth the candle
even though it might culminate in total failure

then after what seemed an age the skin was empty
and the mouth and eye and other openings secured with
paraffme-treated canvas fortunately the ship had been stocked
with enough canvas for two new sets of sail besides the ones
in use we used a large part of this canvas for a temporary
shelter

  we decided to commence filling the blimp with gas at once
because we knew that the production of such an enormous
amount of gas with our meagre facilities would be a long
process long enough no doubt to afford ample time to build
our gondola steering and propelling apparatus

  after a great deal of difficulty we succeeded in improvising
a movable canvas partition with an air-inflated border calcu-
lated to move along the interior of the huge creature confining
the gas on one side and expelling the air on the other

  then we put the generator into operation this plant was
destined to stay in service night and day for weeks producing
gas slowly but steadily while we worked and while we slept

  we used our masts and most of the rope and wire on board
to build a contraption to hold the great bag to earth after it
was partly inflated but not yet ready for flight

  then we constructed the lightest possible gondola using the
long strips of whalebone from the whales mouth for braces

and struts and canvas sails for sides and covering

   next we took the light gasoline engine out of one of the
little boats and rigged it to a hand-carved propeller made from
a part of a mast

   by this time the bow of the whale was raised as high as its
moorings would permit and we installed the operating devices
and hung the gondola beneath-all made from odds and ends
from the ship our steering apparatus was especially primi-
tive it consisted simply of small wire cables running through
pulleys and attached to the whales fins by means of sheets of
tin made from fruit containers laced to the fins with fish cord
these lines were operated by crude wooden levers and were
capable of moving the fins only a little way fortunately a
whales flukes are horizontal instead of vertical as fishes tails
are the somewhat cumbersome device that we arranged was
unable to move these a great deal because of their lack of
flexibility but we could move them some and we hoped suffi-
ciently to enable us to at least partially govern our horizontal
course

chapter vi
the whale takes the air

  say we hoped to hope was manifestly all we could ilo
about the efficiency of our improvised equipment
obviously there could be no trial flights when once
we left our icebound whaling ship our only hope would be in
good luck and a kind providence for we had no landing gang
to pull us to a mooring mast and no hangar in which to make
alterations or repairs

  we did indeed have a valve in the gas compartment made
from a pump-suckcr with which we might contrive to- let our-
selves down but we knew we would be able to carry prac-
tically no ballast if our calculations taken from the industrial
chemistry book were right it would be enough if we could
lift ourselves and a small supply of gasoline and provisions

  we were now in high spirits for it was daily becoming
more evident that our balloon was going to at least rise from
the ground

   when all the major devices were installed we could see that
it would still be quite a number of days before the gas bag was
filled to capacity so while the captain was busy installing
his compass and other navigating instruments willard and i
were occupied in painting the name of our dirigible the great
ivhale in huge letters on a great canvas banner this we in-
tended to unfurl as soon as we were really on our way-if and
when it happened

   then we declared a holiday and held a formal christening
there remained but three bottles of wine in the ships medical
stores and we emptied one of these and ceremoniously broke
the bottle over the new ship every one present seemed satis-
fied with this arrangement

  midsummer was now approaching and we set the rd of
july for our departure provided of course that our supply of
gas was then adequate and the wind favorable

   the captain completed his jog and we all wrote letters to
friends and relatives to be left at the ship for we hoped that
some time airmen or explorers might find the deserted hulk and
carry our communications back to civilization even if we our-
selves never arrived

   i also prepared a report to the museum describing our whale
giving measurements and other scientific data that i thought
would be of interest to naturalists

  the morning of july rd was disappointing there was
little wind and our smoke indicated further that it was in
the wrong direction traveling toward the pole

   but as the morning wore on the breeze died entirely and
at about eleven oclock a light breeze started from the oppo-
site direction
the arctic rescue



of course we had no means of observing in which direc-
tion the currents were moving in the upper air but we
decided to take a chance

  we descended to the galley and ate a hasty lunch stowed a
generous basket of cooked food and an emergency kit in the
gondola and prepared to cast off

  there were a few moments of dramatic suspense as one by
one we pulled the lines that untied the slip-knots that held the
bag to earth

  at last one large rope made fast to the gondola and attached
to an iron pin in the ice was all that held us to terra firma

  well heres to a prosperous voyage said the captain
grimly and leaning over with his long knife he cut the rope

  with a wild lurch the buoyant craft lifted far above the
old whaling vessel

  but evidently we had made a mistake in locating our gondola
it was so far forward that the bow end of the whale was de-
pressed and the tail flaunted high in air

  i hope the old fool isnt getting ready to sound said the
captain

  maybe she will do better when we get the propeller going
said willard

  to our great satisfaction we continued to rise until we were
perhaps three or four hundred feet in the air and then com-
menced drifting broadside to the wind

  well lets see if we can navigate her said the captain
and willard who now styled himself chief engineer started
the tiny engine

  as the propeller developed speed we commenced to turn tail
to the wind and the forward end rose until we were almost
on an even keel needless to say ve were now in jubilant mood

  the next stop said willard will be in the sunny south

  the wind now appeared to be very much stronger whether
this was due to a rising wind or to our increased altitude we
were undecided we were still rising although at what rate
we had no means of ascertaining we found however that
we were able to deviate about fifteen degrees from our normal
course

southward bound

the horizontal manipulations were not so good but by
putting the lever hard over we could observe a very per-
ceptible change in the horizontal level of the craft

  we decided to set the tail flukes at such an angle as to
prevent our being carried any higher because it was becoming
very cold besides we knew in which direction the wind was
blowing at this level and we didnt want to take a chance of
encountering adverse currents in the upper levels

  we at length succeeded in stabilizing our course at what we
judged to be an elevation of about a quarter of a mile

  but the wind continued to rise it whistled shrilly through
our rigging and we began to fear that it would become so
strong as to batter our hand-made craft to pieccs

  we had no idea how much pressure our thin fibreless gas
bag would stand without buckling we did know however
that keeping tail to the wind would minimize this pressure
and we urged willard to keep the little engine going full speed
in spite of the fact that our supply of gasoline was very limited

  for several hours the character of the seascape was un-
changed  but at length the captain searching the horizon with
his glasses announced that he could see land far ahead and
away to the right of our course

  very shortly we made out some low mountain peaks and
later the outlines of a small island

  as we passed a few miles to the cast of this island we saw
that it was snowclad and desolate but at least it was land
and it looked good to us for we had not had a sight of land
for more than three years

  after eating a very cold supper from our lunch basket
we decided to divide the time to watches of four hours each

one sleeping while the others took care of the sliip

  for the next couple of days and nights i had little memory
of the passage oi time i do remember however seeing the
sun sink out of sight indicating that we had crossed the arctic
circle and i remember waking after a troubled sleep to find
our balloon was passing over land cold and barren land
blotched with patches of snow

  willard had stopped the engine to save fuel since the wind
had diminished enough to materially lessen the danger of wreck
the temperature was quite noticeably rising

  if this wind keeps on another day said the captain after
making some observations and figures we ought to be ap-
proaching the good old u s a

  i suspect that this is an unexplored portion of northern
canada i taink i saw some trees a few miles back

then early one morning willard aroused me from sleep
he was in a state of great excitement
we arc coming to a city he shouted get upl quick i
we are going to try to make a landing

  i jumped up and looked out the sun had just risen and
all beneath was flooded with golden light intermingled with
long dark shadows

  and we were indeed approaching a city i a city beside a
shining river all resplendent in the morning sun the river
was dotted with shipping boats of all descriptions from mere
fishing smacks and tugs to ocean liners and it was spanned by
tall and massive bridges at the shore line were long docks
tall warehouses and grain elevators

  the principal part of the city seemed to cling to a precipitous
hill which rose grandly from the waters edge and the sum-
mit of this hill was crowned with a tall and splendid building
that dominated the whole landscape

  do you know where we arc asked willard

  yes i responded joyfully there can be no doubt about
it we are coming to quebec i

  there is but one such city in the world i

  after our long exile this was indeed a wonderful sight mo
our eyes and all of us were as enraptured as though we were
gazing at an enchanted world

  we must watch out for a suitable place and try to make
a landing said the captain at length pulling himself together
with a visible effort

  no doubt our craft has been sighted and news of our
coming broadcast	

  perhaps they even know we are from the mansion i wish
we had the morning paper they must be able to see our big
banner by now said willard as he took the glasses

  i can see people looking at us with telescopes and here
comes an airplane to meet us

  as he spoke we saw a biplane making a beeline in our
direction

  we ought to land long enough to get some more gas and
some sandwiches and wire the museum at washington to open
wide the front doors for the largest whale they ever saw is
going to sail right in said willard laughingly

  yes said the captain and i shall send a wire to a cer-
tain mrs captain baker of new bedford massachusetts

  as the airplane came near we saw a cameraman climb out
on the fuselage and frantically grind off pictures of us the
plane passed close enough to exchange greetings and then
wheeled and sped back the way it had come

  several shots were fired from the roof of the dominating
building and through the glasses we could sec a considerable
crowd of people gathering

  i think they are signalling us to try and land at that build-
ing said captain baker and i reckon that high flagpole
wouldnt make a bad mooring mast

  a little to starboard helmsman

fortunately there was little wind and the engine was func-

a sequel to men with wings

entlemen began the mentor as he faced the
nine terrestrial leaders i realize that you are
very curious to know why i have called you to-
gether without acquainting you with what  wish
to discuss yet i am certain that each of you
has already guessed the purpose of this conference 

  there were murmurs of assent from the nine men seated
around the table

  for a long time went on the mentor our medical men
have been seeking to fight the menace that is threatening to
depopulate our world of its women ever since the inception
of the winged race in fact science has been trying to save
the women who so valiantly carry on the tremendous task of
bringing young into the world for as you know at least
five in every ten die in giving birth to our
winged children

  thus man has been able to improve up-
on nature in one way only to fall down
in another for she has struck down our
mothers with a terrible unknown malady
ihat attacks them in childbirth you know
of our continued efforts to discover what
this strange disease is and to find some
cure gentlemen our earth is being de-
populated of its women president adull
how many adult women are recorded liv-
ing in your protectorate the mentor
was addressing the representative from
africa a negro

  at the present time mentor they num-
ber no more than one hundred thousand
against five million adult males of- fe-
males who have not yet reached their ma-
turity there arc but two million against the
forty-odd million young males i

  i see    and gentlemen that is among a race of people
who have heretofore proven themselves extremely hardy with
only three deaths out of ten women who go through childbirth i

the mentor was silent for several moments as he con-
sidered these facts he turned to the eastern european
a member of the old world germanic strains president
muller how many adult women do you report living

   in all our territory sir there are but fifty thousand against
two million adult males of unwed females we have but six
million i

  and of young males

this meeting he could not have understood  and he would
have been vastly surprised to learn of the many changes that
had taken place in the map of the world during the ten cen-
turies that had slipped by in his day it might indeed have
been possible to foresee that the united states of america would
one day include the entire north american continent together
with the islands of the south seas and that the numerous
nations of latin america would be fused in one

  it would also have been conceivable to him that england
would gain jurisdiction over one half of europe and germany
over the other half that arabia would swallow all of asia
minor turkey and egypt the african negro would come
into his own and with the exception of egypt control all of
the dark continent that the hindu of india would have
possession of al of southern asia china
would control siberia manchuria korea
and japan while australia and new
zealand would join hands as an inde-
pendent state

but our early-twentieth-century man
might well have raised his brows up-
on hearing that all these great nations now
owed their allegiance to the greater office
of the mentor or planet ruler whom the
nine lesser potentates elected from their
own number and who ruled from the
great palace at havana cuba where their
conference was now taking place and
what would have surprised him most of
all was the remarkable physical change
that had come over the inhabitants of the
world as the appearance of these ten men
with their strange problems bore witness
   and the source of his wonder would have lain in the fact
that they possessed natural wings great powerful living
wings-more powerful than the wings of the eagle i
to understand how mankind had come into the heritage of
wings one must turn back the yellowed pages of history to
the sixteenth century to one howard mentor who with his
science made wings possible to man one can thrill anew on
reading the history of the centuries in the brazilian wilds when
the little race of mentorites struggled to put wings upon their
offspring and fought off the great nations of the earth who
sought to punish them for their abduction of women it will
be recalled that the mentorites stole unwinged women that they
might continue to breed an dinted race schoolchildren know
the date when horace mentor descendent of the original
mentor faced the world court
that existed at that time and de-
manded that his nation be given
recognition by the world since
the winged people had without a
doubt proved their superiority
over the other nations and he
won his point it was a great
day for the planet when the men-
torites were given that sanction
and when america opened her
arms to them and even gave per-
mission for the mentorites to
breed wings upon her citizenry

  and so with the years the
  world acknowledged that wings
  had proved more efficient than

air wonder stories

 flying-machines with their smell of burning oils and their clat-
 tering noise and awkwardness of maneuver as well as the
 hazards of their construction one after another america
 had conquered her fellow-nations with her hordes of winged
 men with her electro-thunderbolts and aero-electrovoid ma-
 chines until the time came when she could have possessed
 the earth wisely however she refrained from enforcing such
 sovereignty contenting herself with enabling her fellow-beings
 to grow wings and over them all she established her pro-
 tectorate claiming only the right to interfere in their control
 when it meant a disrupting of the worlds peace but men
 with wings are a peaceable people little given to wars or
 rebellion when man is enabled to fly like a bird into the
 sky he is little troubled with the narrow selfish outlook of
 the grubbing worm some of the great wonder and pcace of
 the universe the beauty of the horizon is instilled in his soul
 and he knows that progress and brotherhood are so interwoven
 as to become one i

the peace and contentment that now belonged to the
earthlings was evident in the faces of the ten gathered
for conference color was of no consequence to these broad-
visioned men who as representatives of the various races of
earth bespoke the new understanding of this great truth the
mentor the planet ruler assumed this title and name on taking
office was a man of some fifty years as fine a figure of a
man as could be found upon the planet his hair was as crisp
as a youths and his eyes were dark wells of understanding
his face was the face of a leader but his leadership was tem-
pered with a compassion for those he ruled he stood a few
inches over six feet and the great wings that rose from between
his shoulder-blades had a span when open of twenty feet
for with the centuries the wings of the aloted had grown in
size those of the mentor were covered with golden-brown
feathers that were soft and silky to the touch his clothing
was close-fitting the garments affording a minimum of re-
sistance to the wind and to lessen that resistance still more
they were made of a sleek silky material in color they were
tinted a delicate shade of yellow that blended well with the
golden-brown of the wings

 the other men at his table differed but little from the mentor
 their wings it is true were of a variety of colors-some solidly
 hued some variegated-and their clothing usually was pig-
 mented to correspond to the wing coloring for the winged
 people liked harmony of color learned as it were from natures
 carefully manipulated brush the only radical difference to
 be noted in the group was their racial colorings and each one
 was the finest specimen of his own race their faces were
 usually very regular in contour for with the knowledge that
 it is possible to grow new parts upon their bodies had come the
 knowledge of perfecting their physical features until except
 in color they were almost counterparts of one another gone
 was the racial flatness of the chinese face and its bland in-
 scrutable eyes while the negro had as regular clear-cut features
 as the englishman who sat beside him

they must be saved

ow ihe patriarch was speaking again

something must be done immediately about our
women my friends else we shall find ourselves a doomed race
it means race suicide to continue as we are

there has been talk mentor of sending out an expedition
to other planets in search of more women president chang
of the chinese empire said slowly

the mentor looked up sharply even were that possible
sir are we marauders

this is not a time for ethics mentor the first of the

 	machines that created a vacuum in the air into which enemy cratt

 were drawn by suction

alated did not balk at stealing women so that they could con-
tinue to propagate the race i

   that is true enough but still we cannot tolerate such a
procedure and after all that is but half a solution our
women-our sisters our mothers our wives-are dying i it
is our individual women as well as our race that we must save 
have you a solution sir that you summoned us to hear
slowly and sorrowfully the mentor shook his head the
only solution that i can see is one that should not be considered
except in the most extreme circumstances yet it may be
that the time has come when we must admit that course i
called you here today with the hope that some one of you may
have a plan or else that you will signify your willingness for
us to go on with the program i am forced to lay before you
it is nothing less than removal of the wings from the backs
of your peoples for i am convinced that the disease that
attacks our women came with the winging of the race in this
way we may hope to save these millions of women who will go
inevitably to their deaths for although a mother may escape
with one child statistics prove that either the second third
fourth or fifth child invariably brings her to her death we
have tried every other means we know but every experiment
proves a failure i

  i am certain that the answer lies rather in our seeking
women from one of the known inhabited planets mentor
insisted the chinese president
again the mentor shook his head you may be correct
president chang but even if you were right where is the
means of our crossing space to another planet true attempts
have been made but each invention has proven impractical i

chang smiled in japan there is a group of men who
tell us that they have perfected such a machine sir i

  the mentor jerked to alertness what do you mean  why
have i not been informed of this his eyes blazed for
although the protectorate was not severe with the nations the
planet ruler must needs know all the events worthy of note
without fail for only in that manner was it possible to keep
the world balanced and to administer to one nation as to an-
other so that jealousies and antipathies might not be given
encouragement

   the reports have been duly submitted at havana mentor
even now they probably repose in your files we have been
surprised that no word was received from you concerning this
great discovery for we only await your permission to begin
work on the astralnautic flyer that you were not informed
points to negligence on the part of your secretaries

   it shall be looked into immediately president chang and
the person whose duty it was to acquaint me with this mo-
mentous matter shall suffer for his carelessness

   a slovenly clerk is a menace to a well-ordered office
quoted the chinese

  the mentor nodded and wrote some words upon the auto-
graphic pad at his side that would convey his message instan-
taneously to the proper office

  and now gentlemen have you any suggestions to make
concerning our great problem  for us to set about de-winging
our future generations is a drastic step and i realize that
none of you wish to place your sanction on it if there is hope
that our dilemma may be solved in some other manner have
you any suggestions

  when there was no reply the conference turned to other
affairs then an attendent appeared at the door to announce
that it was the hour of the mid-day meal the mentor led
the way from the conference room to one of the open shafts
that were set at intervals throughout the governmental build-
ing these shafts were fully fifty feet square and reached
from the ground level to the open sky above doorways pierced
the shafts upon all sides opening off every floor of the building
before the advent of wings men had used mechanical lifts to
women with wings



teltc them from level to level but the alaled ascended or de-
scended upon their own power one by one the ten stepped
from the doorway and with outstretched wings lifted them-
selves to the broad roof above

               chapter ii
               atop the city

upon the roof were tables set under wide awnings with
large mechanical fans beating the air to keep it re-
freshingly cool a number of tables were already occu-
pied by diners who rose from their seats at the approach of the
ten terrestrial leaders and seated themselves again when the
official party had taken its places at the large table set for
them under another awning half a dozen musicians were
playing upon various musical instruments filling the languid
midday air of havana with their sweet notes

  havana was scarcely different from the city of the twentieth
century except that it was now larger and more beautiful
from the parapet of the roof could be seen the lovely city
below like a jewel in the setting that nature herself had
created the harbor scintillating and iridescent under the noon-
day sun the gleam of its facets flashing with every underlying
movement of the water overhead was the cerulean blue of
the sky forming an infinite domed roof and to the beauty
of the city with its houses of many hues and its palm-lined
streets was added the flash of wings of every color of the
rainbow as the flying people moved about on their matters of
business mostly keeping to the traffic lanes but once and again
talcing a flight toward the sun for the pure joy of living

the mentors party was served by efficient servants with
delicately prepared foods and a great variety of the fruits
for which the tropics are noted for an hour or so they sat
upon the roof listening to the music of the trained players
and all over the globe earthlings were listening to the same
music if such was their wish through the radio sets or they
could switch on their visual-screens and see their leaders sit-
ting together the world was aware that the ten were gathered
here together and were anxiously -awaiting some portent of
good news

  now in the sky there were hundreds of people who sought
to catch a glimpse of their leaders the manner in which they
satisfied their curiosity was not trying to the potentates for the
flying people did not ogle but flew quietly by some dropped
flowers on the roofs tiled floor and the awnings as they passed
but these attentions were paid in a disctjeet manner

  as the sun climbed higher and higher the fans were not
enough to prevent the air under the awnings from becoming
warm so after their meal was over the mentor suggested
that they descend to the garden below descent was made
down the shaft by which they had arrived during a rain a
glass roof slid across the shaft top to protect those moving
from floor to floor but at other times the shafts were open
to the sky for the winged people more often left their buildings
by way of these shafts than through the doorway on the
ground floors the full length windows of the chambers were
also used for exits and entrances in the private buildings and
homes the same features existed and the old spanish type of
building with its inner palio open to the sky was well suited
to the flying people

  thus the party dropped the five floors and emerged into a
cool garden shaded by a movable roof there they sat for
several hours discussing questions that had come up in their
various domains at four they left the governmental building
for the beautiful one-floored home of the mentor where they
took a siesta there they met the beautiful mate of the
mentor his three sons and one daughter the family name of
the planet ruler was page although in his official capacity he

was known as the mentor

  there were no other women in the home beside the wife and
daughter nor were there any other servants than the mechani-
cal robots that had been perfected to such a high degree of
efficiency that the care of the house and the kitchen was left
to them the housewife had only to set their dials for the
prescribed task and knew it would be carried out far better
than any human servant could do it

  that evening after the dinner in the mentors well appointed
home they listened to a program of music then watched some
dancing and a drama that was being enacted at one of the great
radio broadcasting stations of the world needless to say for
two centuries now a universal tongue bad been adopted and
was spoken all over the world

  the following morning the mentors nine guests bade him
farewell and with the coming of the sun were ready to return
to their own capitals this was to be accomplished by wing
and one by one the presidents each accompanied by his per-
sonal retinue departed cither for the east the west the north
or the south

  there were thousands of the winged people abroad at that
early hour for they were early risers and with flowers and
songs saw the departing administrators on their way into the
heavens

the space-flyer

an hour later the mentor was again in his office and before
 him was spread the report of the invention of the japanese
scientists already the clerk who had been at fault in not
informing the mentor of its arrival had been demoted after
studying the plans the mentor gave an order to have himself
put in touch with the inventors of the interplanetary machine
over a private radio hook-up he spoke for an hour or so to
the two men whose brains had conceived the stupendous work
shortly thereafter the two were in the air  their way to
havana where they were to confer with the mentor upon the
possible construction of the flyer

  in the meantime the mentor had brought together a half
dozen renowned engineers to study the diagrams and after
many hours spent in a study of the plans they admitted that such
a machine was theoretically feasible

  flying as the japanese did at one hundred and fifty miles
per hour it would take them a little over sixty hours to reach
havana they carried food and drink with them but de-
scended at way stations to rest and refresh themselves from
childhood the winged people were taught endurance in flight
and a youth did not come to manhood until he had made a
single sustained journey of at least three thousand miles the
muscles of the back and wing-cases were carefully developed
so that their owners would not become knotty and muscle-
bound nor give out under the long strain of enforced flights
in the beginning the winged men might have perfected the
flying-machines along with their wings but their leaders had
been wise in realizing that the wings would deteriorate if the
machines were to be depended upon and history has proved
time and time again that men who placed their dependence upon
artificial mechanisms were apt to bccome physically decadent
the winged people of earth could never be called that

on arriving in havana the two japanese san tu ackwa
and yoto murca went to one of the citys beautiful
hotels where they took a few hours of rest before presenting
themselves to the mentor unselfishly the two scientists had
given themselves for many years to the perfection of a machine
designed to release their fellow-men from the gravitational
shackles of earth and allow them to soar into the great void
to extend their conquest of space still more they had no
thought for monetary reward for gold as a means of barter
and wealth had gone out of existence instead their names


air wonder stories

would go down in history as benefactors of the race-men
who had given the world a boon that was invaluable

  with them they had brought the model of their invention
and set about to demonstrate it to the mentor and the engi-
neers be had gathered about him the model was a perfect
sphere made of the light and durable dialutnim set as a
girdle around it was a series of round mirrors concave and
convex in the bottom of the sphere was the manhole for
entrance and from its top ran a vertical strip of quartz crystal
that would serve as windows for the interplanetary travelers
by unscrewing bolts san tu ackwa exposed the inside of the
globe here was a large wheel that almost entirely filled the
sphere but did not touch the sides of the globe the wheel
was suspended upon a hollow shaft that ran across between the
two supporting walls of the sphere and around its hub was a
series of crystal openings

  san first explained the motive power of the flyer he pointed
out that within the hub of the strange wheel lay the motor
mechanisms for centuries now the earthlings had been using
the solar power machine in place of the old electric fuel and
water driven machines of the ancients all power as one
knows is derived from the solar rays that come across the
ninety-three million miles of space between earth and the sun
the ancients had had to depend upon wood coal oil and elec-
tricity to gather this force but it had remained for the th
century man to take that power directly from the sun itself
this was done by the heliogenerators great mirrors that con-
centrated the heat-rays formerly man had to resort to steam
engines to utilize the heat to derive their power but with
the discovery of great deposits of radio-active ores in various
parts of the world the suns energy was taken up and concen-
trated on the radium without the need of engines and by the
release of energy a powerful rocket effect was obtained

a demonstration

it was by this method that the japanese had planned to
propel their flyer the girdle of mirrors would receive the
suns rays and send it to the rotor housing within the sphere
where the radium was located the convex mirrors were pro-
vided to reverse this power so that it would act as a brake for
the machine tossing off the heat generated by the concave mir-
rors and by this intricate method of cooling bring the sphere
to a halt

  now by setting the sphere in the sunlight that poured through
the window san tu ackwa after switching on the rotor
motors within allowed them to generate power a cable
fastened to a small box with a keyboard on its surface showed
how much power the motors were generating when the dial
showed a sufficient amount he touched one of the keys and
controlled the movements of the sphere it rose and moved
about the room circled their heads went out the window to
the length of its cord then returned to the table top and
alighted without a jar

  with that demonstration completed the inventor now pro-
cedcd to point out the features of the wheel that were puzzling
the mentor and his engineers opening one section of the rim
he showed the living quarters for the crew and interplanetary
passengers series of spiral stairways joined the rim of the
wheel to the hub with its machineries and engines the spokes
of the wheel that held the rim in place were hollow shafts
whereby the passengers could fly to the hub these shafts
were also to carry the ventilation pipes as well as the water to

	to better understand the amount of he radiated by tbe ran it mnst
tint be known that the rate at whicb radiant energy of all wavelengths is
received by the earth from tbe sun at the outer surface of our atmosphere
when the sun it at its mean distance is in terms of mechanical work
 horse power per square yard from this it can be seen that with a
large number of great mirrors an immense concentration of energy could
be obtained

the living quarters in fact nothing seemed to have been for-
gotten for the comfort of the passengers the heating and tbe
refrigerating the lighting the sanitation measures the radio
and visual apparatus and every living-room bed-room dining-
room and bathroom as well as several kitchens was as well
equipped in miniature as it would be in life-size

the feature that was strangely striking however was that
the living quarters were upon the rim of the wheel the
ceilings being toward the hub of the machine yoto murca
here took up the explanation he demonstrated that inasmuch
as in space there is no gravity and gravity can be replaced
only by some other force they proposed to utilize centrifugal
force for this purpose to understand centrifugal force better
it must be understood that whereas gravity operates toward the
center of mass centrifugal force operates away from the center
therefore in the quarters set in he rim of the wheel which
was to produce centrifugal force by rotating around the hub
that which is up means toward the axis while down is
outward from the center the axis of rotation it was calcu-
lated that if the wheel made one revolution in about  seconds
with its diameter of  feet a man would be pressed to the
floor with the same force as he would be pressed normally to
the surface of the earth

for hours the mentor and the scientists discussed the ma-
chine a few minor adjustments were suggested here and
there but on the whole it was agreed that the space-flyer was
practical and he mentor gave the inventors the assurance
that a trial ship would be constructed under their supervision
at the far end of the island of cuba where the great experi-
mental laboratories were located in which all the newest inven-
tions were built and given trial the following day the two
japanese left with a letter to the governor of the laboratories
instructing him to place men and materials at their disposal
it would take many months to build the space-flyer since casts
would have to be built for its many intricate parts and it
would take even longer to completely lit it out as the mentor
directed but his eyes were shining brightly as he bid san
tu ackwa and yoto murca good day he was happy in the
realization that the earthlings were to master another great
field of science however no announcement would be given
to the world until the space-flyer had proved itself

the mentors decision

in his chambers now sat the mentor alone he was weary
for the days that had passed since the conference he had
been working accepting and rejecting new plans for the
welfare of his people and only now did he find himself with
a few hours of leisure but there was no rest for him he
was too much troubled with the momentous question at hand
to be able to seek recreation what was the world to do about
its women true there were something like forty millions
of young immature females in the world thousands of whom
were daily reaching the age where they would take upon them-
selves the duties of wifehood only to succumb as their mothers
had in that terrible hour with each generation the problem
grew for nothing seemed possible to save the women and
what was the world to do when man should at last find him-
self without a single woman in his midst true the life span
of the individual had been greatly lengthened by science thi
seventy years of the ancients had been prolonged to two hun-
dred but in that alone was no solution

  the mentor slowly turned to president changs suggestion
concerning a raid upon another world for women astronomers
knew that at least two of the planets sustained life namely
venus and mars and a number of the satellites of both jupiter
women with wings



and saturn were also known to be congenial to human licc
and now with the invention of the space-flyer such a raid
could eventually be made but what if life upon these planets
was different from our own  perhaps nature had not repeated
herself and the beings of these other worlds were of a different
species and even if human life dwelt upon these worlds the
mentor was still averse to engaging in wholesale kidnapping
to rob another world of its female population was to leave it
in the same predicament as the earth was now in and how
could the earths people whose only religion was brotherhood
willingly cause such a condition upon a sister planet no the
mentor decided mankind would not consent to despoil others
in an effort to save itself other measures must be used
wearily he pushed the button that would bring a clerk to him
fifteen minutes later two of the most renowned members of
the medical profession stood before him these men had just
come from the medical congress that had met to take up the
studies of a dr moore with regard to changing the present
method of bringing children into the world

  what is the decision of the congress asked the
  mentor

  sir to do what he proposes will be a momentous step for
us to take answered one of the doctors nature can not
be changed in a day and the time required to make the altera-
tions moore expects will be too long for by that time thou-
sands of our women must be sacrificed i for the sake of
womanhood itself the congress agrees that such a project
should not be considered it is too late for us to proceed upon
such a course although there is no doubt about its feasibility i
doctor horace wilson sighed as he finished

  the mentor nodded his head sadly and yet doctor some-
thing has to be done as you well know is it possible for you
to de-wing our people as mentor once winged us

  wilson nodded slowly almost unwillingly it can be done
sir acting on your suggestion of several months previous
i have had a number of my assistants experimenting on such a
solution they only await your commands to manufacture the
serums in balk i

   it is not the solution that we want sighed the mentor but
i know your department has done everything possible to save
the lives of our women howard mentor of course never
dreamed of an unknown disease arising when he set about to
give us wings of course we realize it will take generations
for us to undo what he has done but i wish you gods aid
else we die

  here doctor herbert morris the second scientist spoke i
believe mentor that it is wrong for us to turn to this
means    yet you know that for many years we have been
working upon the possibility of producing our young through
inedianical agencies up to this time it is true weve had little
success but now i am beginning to sec a glimmering of light
we have been working along the wrong lines but at last re-
sults arc beginning to show if you will only consent to wait
one more year i am certain that we can produce all the winged
children required i

year is a long time doctor and our women die daily
i know that sir but if you will but give us that
length of time i am positive we can save the rest as well as
bring into being as many females as are needed to offset the
present deficit of course when that is accomplished it will
mean that the duties of childbearing must afterward be left
wholly to our machines but in doing so we shall stabilize the-
number of men and women and man will not be deprived of
womans companionship i

  if we could be sure of success doctor i would gladly give
my permission to continue your experiments before dr wilson
commences his task of removing the wings from our future

race the loss of our women is appalling

  morris nodded he knew that only yesterday there had
passed away the mentors own beautiful mate the nations
were grieving with their kindly leader

  it was then that wilson spoke sir said he i think that
my colleague is right it were best that he be given that
single year to accomplish his purpose i have been in his
laboratories and have seen the great progress he is making
in the meantime i would suggest that all women be sterilized
temporarily 

  with that the mentors dark eyes brightened well thought
doctor why has no one thought of such a respite sooner
better we have no children than to allow the women to die
doctor morris shall have his year and before night the word
will be sent around the world i he smiled and held out his
hstd to morris to your success sir then he was shak-
ing hands with doctor wilson that afternoon word went out
that child-bearing was to be forbidden for a years term

chapter iv

the strange visitor

it was a week later that the mentor was startled by a mes-
sage that came to him from the lick astronomical observa-
tory upon the pacific coast when its significance dawned
on him he immediately took to the air with but a single attend-
ant his eldest son alvin page the world was surprised to
hear of his sudden departure for it was seldom that the planet
ruler ever left the seat of government for days now the
earthlings had been in a ferment the edict forbidding the
conception of young-that had followed the meeting of the ten
terrestrial leaders had left the populace restless and puzzled
since they had known that the condition of the womanhood
of the world was serious it was natural that they should see
in this unprecedented journey of the mentor something con-
cerning the matter at hand however the message requesting
the mentors presence at lick had had nothing to do with the
affairs of the globe

  its content was of far different purport the observatory
upon mount hamilton was by far the largest of its kind in
the world the lenses of the telescope measuring fifty feet
across and what the astronomers had sighted in them had
been so strangely arresting that they had sent immediately for
the planet ruler for what had been seen was indubitably a
man-made machine leaving the cloud-shrouded face of the
planet venus  and it was headed for earth i
for three hours they had watched it before the planet ruler
was appraised of the strange fact though often it disappeared
from their lenses for it showed nothing more tlian a pencil-
streak of light out in the void it was impossible to determine
its shape but there was no doubt that it was propelled by
sentient beings it was only by an accident however that it
had been discovered at all by a student who had for the first
time turned his eyes upon that distant planet when the strange
shape had swum into his vision he had called for a more
learned astronomer photographs had instantly been taken and
developed while others still peered at the moving flash of light
that appeared to move slowly on its course

venus with her all-enfolding shrouds has always been
an enigma to earth much has been written about her
but little is known for although man with his great telescopes
has been enabled to read the faces of the other planets dearly
venus had continued to hide her secrets once or twice through
the centuries a rift had been reported in the vcnusian clouds
and one astronomer had thought that he glimpsed a city upon
the planets surface but he could never be certain they did
know however that the thick vapory atmosphere differed but
little from that of earth the clouds themselves acting as a


air wonder stories

shield against the intense heat the sun radiated upon it mer-
cury without this shield was an inferno upon its one surface
always turned to the sun while upon the opposite face that
lay forever away from the great star the temperature dropped
at times to absolute zero mars on the other hand was known
to be inhabited for the telescopic photographs marked a num-
ber of great structures and more than one queer craft had been
seen moving through the dusty atmosphere of that world on
the satellite moon of the earth on the shores of the long dead
seas the ruins of wondrous cities had been discovered that
bespoke a race of beings whose needs had been identical with
that of the earthlings why then should not the beautiful
planet venus that lay upon the earth horizon have life thereon

all day and night the mentor and his son had flown across
sea and lowlands plateaux and mountains and near dawn they
came within sight of the towering dome of the observatory
upon mount hamilton arriving on the broad roof just below
the dome they were met by a group of astronomers who with-
out words led them directly to the telescope in a few minutes
they were staring at the long bright ship that now as it neared
earth could be recognized clearly as f cylindrical shape one
strange feature of the flyer lay in the fact that the suns rays
that should have struck it obliquely as it hurtled on its way
were not being reflected but appeared instead to pass directly
through it as though the machine were half transparent i

down to earth 

ithout a doubt observed professor darcy gov-
ernor of the observatory the venusians are bent upon
paying us a call but whether it is to be a friendly visit or one
for purposes of attack we have no way of telling it is evi-
dent however that they are far more advanced than we of
earth since they have succeeded in conquering the void we
have been trying to get in touch with them by means of the
radio but have so far failed

ah but you are wrong professor in believing that venus
is superior to us in intellect the mentor remonstrated just
because they have beaten us in the secret of interplanetary
travel true they are the first to have sent out their ships
but not many months will elapse before an earthly ship also
will be launched into space

you mean it is possible

quickly the mentor told of the invention of the japanese
and of the certainty that it would succeed heretofore our
scientists have failed because of their misconceptions of what
constitutes a space-flying machine but though i have not an-
nounced the fact to the world i am certain that the japanese
sphere will do all that its inventors claim in fact i have
never been more certain of an untried experiment as i am of
this i will not hesitate to go up in it on the initial trip

the principles propounded are sound sir pray that it
may be all that you expect for not only will it widen the horizon
of the earthling but perhaps some day our people will journey
on across the great outer void to other universes and gal-
axies and whats more our scientists will no longer need
to depend upon faulty telescopes to examine the world that
lies beyond

for many hours the watchers never left the telescopes as
they studied the progress of the venusian vessel after care-
ful computation it was estimated that the ships speed was
approximately  miles per second and as venus was then
traveling toward her inferior conjunction and was something
like  miles distant from earth it would take the
space-flyer at least thirty-five hours to reach earth already
for more than thirty hours the scientists had watched her on
her course another four hours and she would arrive  when
or where the flyer would land upon earth they had no way of
knowing

the next few hours were feverish ones for the astrono-
mers for other observers had seen the venusian machine
and were in communication with one another then the broad-
casting stations were sending the news in relays around the
world and efforts were made to photograph it in the tele-
visual screens the observatories had announced that the ship
was gradually slowing down at ten oclock pacific time the
ship was seen to enter the atmosphere traveling at about three
hundred miles an hour slowly it encircled the globe drop-
ping lower and lower until it could be seen by the naked eye
twice more it swung around the globe before it dropped to an
isolated spot along the florida coast not many miles south
of the old resort city of miami immediately the mentor dis-
patched an order that none should approach the stranger within
a radius of two thousand feet until it could be discovered
whether the venusians came as friends or foes with darcy
his son and a number of the scientists the mentor left lick
and headed for the eastern seaboard

   they flew at top speed for the mentor was greatly worried
about this strange circumstance in his heart he feared that
the arrival of the interplanetary machine boded no good for
his world and the earthlings were unprepared for an attack
since their development was along unwarlike lines the mentor
did not speak of his fears to his companions as they winged
their way across the  miles to the eastern coast flying
at  to  miles per hour they could not hope to reach florida
in less than nineteen or twenty hours it was a long trip to
take flying so swiftly and especially for the two members of
the party who had already flown more than that distance not
many hours before moreover they were encountering head
winds and time was always lost in crossing the mighty moun-
tain ranges of the west

disappeared i

when the venusian ship settled upon the sands on an
island that lay between the ocean and biscaync bay
there was a small group of flying men there to witness it
they were six guards whose dutyxit was to keep the great
beacon light on the beach trimmed to guide night flyers out
at sea and also to patrol that part of the shores and sky in
the event that a flyer who had ovci taxed himself could not
come down without aid they had been listening intently to
the broadcast from the observatories and had kept a lookout
for the space-flyer it was they who told the world of its
descent and no sooner had they submitted their report than
they deserted their posts flying swiftly the mile and a half
to where they had seen the stranger drop

   they were greatly astounded by its size for it was fully
two thousand feet in length it lay on the golden sands with-
out a sign of movement its black polished body a blot of shadow
in wonder they stared down upon it not knowing what course
to take had they waited longer at their station they would
have received the mentors command not to draw near but
now after a moments parley they drew closer alighting upon
the sands they stalked about the black cylinder at a safe
distance and were surprised at not finding a visible entrance
for although its black exterior appeared to be of glass it was
so thick that the figures within could be seen only as through
a haze so engrossed was one fellow by this phenomenon he
approached the smooth wall and sought to see through it by
shading his eyes with his hands the others saw him suddenly
turn and run but he had not taken more than a dozen steps
before he had thrown up his arms and dropped to the sands
lifeless  immediately the others took to wing but not one
escaped the invisible attack for one by one they all dropped
to the ground the venusians had spoken  it was war 

   in twenty minutes or so a number of the winged people from
miami had arrived they congratulated themselves that they
were first upon the scene for the sands surrounding the long
black cylinder with its needle-sharp nose were empty of life
women with wings



chafing at the command of the mentor not to approach
closer than the two thousand feet the dozen or so men
llcw about trying to discover what they could of the intruder
still for all its quietness there was a feeling among the
winged people that they were being stared at and a malevolent
spirit seemed to pervade the very air about the ship more
and more people were arriving on the scene and officials ap-
peared bringing men to police the circle so that none would
approach the venusian ship at close hand occasionally a fel-
low or two would fly too near and be severely reprimanded
by the government officials among them had they known of
the shooting and subsequent disappearance of the beacon
guards there might have been demonstrations of violence from
the crowds but there was no sign of the six bodies the
crowds could only stare and gape at the dark shape with im-
patience why did it show no life why did not the travelers
show themselves what did they fear many opinions were
passed as to what should be done some believed that a party
should descend to the sands and signal to the venusians others
thought that attempts should be made to break into it some-
thing should be done but they knew they were waiting for
the planet ruler to arrive still why did not the venusians
themselves act did they really fear violence from the milling
crowd

  word was next received that president trent of north
america was on his way with a party of officials from wash-
ington and shortly after that report came a corps of radiomen
from the broadcasting systems to set up apparatus to inform
the world of what happened

  the crowds in the sky were continually increasing as the
flying people came from miles around the difficulty of the
officials to keep them in place grew the sand dunes of the
cay were becoming literally covered by the people who alighted
for a few minutes before taking to the air again the excite-
ment that prevailed grew until the air was loud with the sound
of the thousands of voices and the whirr of the powerful wings
then as the radio-corps had their apparatus ready they com-
menced broadcasting estimating that over fifteen thousand were
gathered round about the tele-visual shortly thereafter took
the scene and the world saw the long cylinder crouching on the
sands like a half-sleeping monster half the world had aroused
itself from sleep to see that strange picture and listened avidly
to the words of the announcer as he conjectured about the people
who were in the ship who had crossed  miles of
space and yet seemed fearful of facing the crowds of their
sister planet earth

  then with a suddenness that was inexplicable the voice
ceased speaking and the scene was blotted simultaneously from
the visual screens all over the world the broadcasting sta-
tions were besieged with queries demanding to know what was
wrong station nn in miami which had been receiving the
reports from the beach frantically attempted to discover the
cause for the cessation of the program and announced that
the trouble came not from them but from the apparatus on the
cay flyers were being dispatched immediately from miami
to discover what had occurred

chapter v

shadows in the night

  a lmost an hour passed before the world received news
r again it came from a reporter at miami who had been
the first to reach the interplanetary ship and return he
averred that although he had found the space-flyer in its place
exactly as it had been seen through the visual screens not a
single soul of the fifteen thousand spectators who had gathered
there could be found i it was as though they had disappeared
completely from the face of the earth an examination of
the radio-lay-out proved that it was completely dead and the
power-machines of the beacon station as well

  consternation reigned upon the globe  cries were coming
in from all sides that an attack be made upon the visitor fear
crept into many hearts

  the mentor and his party flew faster and president trent
and his retinue also rushed to the scene several thousand
other men hurried there too but dared not approach within a
mile of the now evidently sinister cylinder but soared high
above from jacksonville a contingent of men put out from
the old arsenal with bundles of electro-thunderbolts the ancient
fire-arm that had not been used since the third war but which
had been preserved merely as relics these weapons were small
cylindrical tubes about six inches in length and each contained
six electric charges that sent a powerful charge of electricity
a thousand feet it was these thunderbolts that the mentorites
had used in  to defeat the combined armies of the world
it was to be doubted that these simple little weapons could be
of any use against the science of the venusians

  the question was now what had happened to those fifteen
thousands had the venusians murdered them and carried
them thence into their ship or had they merely used a weapon
that completely disintegrated flesh and bone if the latter was
the case why should the venusians seek to murder so wantonly
surely they did not believe that in that way they could hope
to conquer the globe facts pointed rather to their having
used either a gas or an invisible ray that paralyzed the muscles
after which it had been a simple matter for them to carry their
captives into their ship that the motors of the radio and
beacon station had been paralyzed also pointed to such a pos-
sibility and fifteen thousand men could easily have been
stored away in that great hulk but why what was the
motive behind the act

an hour before sundown the american president and his
 party arrived on the scene but he did not approach the
space-machine he ordered the electro-thunderbolts distributed
among all those gathered with directions to shoot down any
of the invaders who might make any signs of violence but
he also realized the ineffectualness of those ancient arms against
the black bulk of the cylinder then from tampa arrived
a dozen flyers carrying a number of heavy explosive bombs
that they had pilfered from the museum in their city they
thought to drop the explosives upon the venusian ship but
the officials forbade it they were not sure that their brethren
were not imprisoned in the ship and to demolish it would mean
the murdering of thousands of their own people it was agreed
that a decision was a matter for the mentor and they must
await his arrival

  night was descending and with its coming bonfires were
lighted upon the dunes as the earthlings continued their watch
of the stranger in their midst experiment proved that the
power station of the beacon was again in working order and
the great beam was turned upon the huge black silent mass
on the sands some of the watchers decided to return to their
homes but a thousand or so stayed to guard the ship during
the night although they were not certain as to what their
watchfulness amounted to

  all went well until a little after midnight when suddenly
without warning the beacon light snapped off nor did a
soul move upon the dunes one or two men who had been in
the air dropped to the ground and lay where they had fallen
not far from the black hulk all were as quiet as the gravel

  it was then that a curious sight could have been seen from
the venusian ship dark shadows crept forth there were per-
haps a hundred of these shadows and it was toward the water
that they moved one of their number leaned forward and
lifted a bit of the salty brine to its lips then gathered with its
fellows in conference others tasted the water then in one
concerted rush they took to the air arose with a little difficulty
a hundred yards hovered a minute or so and then made a
plunge into the darkened waters what a pity the moon was


air wonder stories

not shining i only the presence of the minute phosphorescent
particles that are present in great numbers in floridian waters
traced their course where they hit the water and their passage
as they moved below the surface then they were rising again
on their wings to plunge oncc more into the depths for an
hour or so this performance continued the creatures remaining
under the water as lorg as fifteen minutes at a time then at
last they rose into the air and turned to the land and their
machine half an hour later the long length of the great
vessel climbed skyward with a low moaning hum it showed
no light as it climbed and then it was gone into the darkness 

what did it mean

when the mentor and his company wearily dropped upon
the sands close to the spot where the venusian craft
had lain they were shocked to find nothing but the long de-
pression in the sand to show where it had rested  and not
far away was the mute witness to the scene that had passed
the radio outfit yet on either side for a mile in both direc-
tions lay sprawled in sleep a great number of the earthlings
the blackened ashes of what had been bonfires occasionally
sent up a curl of smoke while not five hundred yards from
the depression where the strange ship had lain was the figure
of a man curled with one wing under him

the new arrivals eyed one another seeking an explanation
in each others faces but none of them had any to offer alvin
page approached the figure on the sand and shook it with
a wide yawn the fellow awakened and appeared astonished that
he had been sleeping then he saw the mentors son and
looked about in wonder he saw the depression and realized
that the venusian ship was gone sheepishly he got to his feet
and found that his one wing was crippled and as he approached
the mentor he was limping painfully trying to recollect what
had befallen him he told simply all that he could remember   
the splash of the light beam on the long machine the bivouac
of his fellows the lighting of the fires and the preparations for
night he recalled that he had climbed high into the sky for
a last look at the cylinder before settling for the night then
a feeling of drowsiness had come over him the terrible sen-
sation of dropping and an inability to save himself he was
awakened only by alvins touch

the others listened in silence

darcy was first to speak they have some damnable con-
trivance that paralyzes anything within its range strange that
they should have captured the first fifteen thousand and leave
another thousand or so sleeping no doubt they were filled to
capacity on the first haul 

page went to arouse president trent whom the man with
the crippled wing had remembered seeing on the left hand side
of the clearing one of the scientists of the mentors party
examined the radio and found that it responded to his touch
at the planet rulers direction the new discovery was broadcast
while all observatories were directed to search the skies for
the interplanetary machine the mentor feared that it might
have gone to another more secluded spot on the globe there
to continue its damage but an hour later reports came that the
venusian machine had been discovered out in the void headed
for venus

president trent joined the mentor he was down-
cast over the fact that he had been found napping he
also told a story of a wave of drowsiness that had come over
him he was crestfallen that the venusians had slipped away
without any attempt on the part of the americans to punish
them he was consoled by the thought that nothing could have
been done anyway

for many minutes the men stood on the sands conjecturing
as to what this visit of the people from their sister planet had
meant why had they come at all what was their purpose
in capturing thousands of our people for now it was re-

garded as certain that the ship had purposely borne away fii-
teen thousand captives

  can it mean queried trent that they are faced with
starvation  or that they were in need of slaves  
darcy shook his head people who are advanced in science
as the venusians appear to be would be able to provide them-
selves with synthetic food and slaves arc not necessary when
people have a working knowledge of mechanics

   what is your opinion then asked the mentor

   perhaps they are faced with the same problem as we   
the dying of our women replied darcy

  yet the party was mostly men i doubt there were a hun-
dred women in the lot said trent
the professor nodded perhaps they want to study our
speciesin order to see whether they can come to live here

  you believe that a race of scientists accomplished this
thing

  why not

  the mentor nodded i have been drawing the same con-
clusions but it is horrible we can not allow it why they
may even return for morel

  and president chang would have it that we were to do
the same thing to abduct women from another world i observed
president trent with a light in his eyes

   last night sir said darcy you were telling us of an
interplanetary machine now in construction is it not possible
now for us to follow the venusians and force them to return
our own to us  ethics no longer counts and we need women i

the coming of the mentor

the mentors face lighted up ah you are right pro-
fessor but we must hurry as it stands now it will take
many months to finish the machine and to war upon venus
we will need more than one machine that will delay us still
longer for i will not order the construction of more flyers
until the first proves its worth it will take many months
before we go to venus to reclaim our own  he sighed and
turned to join the others but as he did so he reeled and would
have fallen had not darcy caught his arm he saw then how
grey and weary all were who had flown from lick and with
a wan smile he noted that they needed sleep president trent
pointed to the beacon station and advised that they retire there
for several hours in the meantime he would attend to such
affairs as required the planet rulers attention

   it was necessary for the mentor and his son to be supported
as they made their way to the haven there they found a
dozen or so recumbent forms stretched in different positions just
as they had been when the light of the beam had been ex-
tinguished by the venusians no one had thought to arouse
them sooner they were astonished to learn what had hap-
pened they helped to make the mentor and his party com-
fortable in the dormitory on the second level of the building
but before dropping to sleep the mentor directed that the corps
of men at work upon the interplanetary machine be doubled
then in a moment he was asleep a few hours of sleep suf-
ficed him however and again he took to the air this time
headed for cuba

   the following day professor darcys views concerning the
venusian expedition were broadcast together with the news
that the earthlings would shortly proceed to venus to aid
their kidnapped brethren the thought that the fifteen thou-
sand were alive heartened all and in the days that followed
there came thousands of applications from over all the world
asking permission to take part in the expedition to venus
the laboratories reported that they needed at least three more
months before the space-flyer could be finished although work
was being rushed day and night

other preparations were also being made and from the
long dosed files of formulas and blueprints of past inven-
women with winos



tions weapons of warfare were being carefully studied by a
group of engineers who were to decide what means would
prove most effective against the vandals of venus so long
had the planet been at peace that little thought had been given
to defensive or offensive armament with her thunderbolts
and her aero-electrovoid machines which had created a vacuum
in the atmosphere and thus drawn down the planes of the
enemy america had centuries before conquered the world
but these things had been so long forgotten that the mentor
was surprised to learn that so many infernal weapons had been
conceived by man that such blood-thirsty strains had existed
in previous generations

  the day came when the first interplanetary flyer was com-
pleted and the world rejoiced with its launching the machine
was duly christened the mentor san tu ackwa and yoto
murca the inventors were to command the ship and at least
thirty mechanical engineers astronomers and scientists were
to accompany it upon its maiden trip wistfully the planet
ruler watched the mentor as it took to the air after its great
helio-generators had absorbed great quantities of the suns rays
as he had told darcy at the lick observatory he had intended
to be a passenger  the initial trip of the machine but the
peoples of the world had cried out against the risking of his
life in the undertaking

  he had to be content instead with watching its progress
through the visual screens as the mentor emerged from the
earths blanket into the darkness of the void the whole
world watched its progress with bated breaths its first stop
was the moon where it was seen to land upon the wide plain
of the sea of serenity the travelers made no attempt to
disembark upon that desolate world since they were unpre-
pared to cope with its conditions from the plain it moved
eastward viewing the awful grandeur of that dead world all
through the journey the mentor attempted to keep in com-
munication with earth but it was almost impossible there
appeared to be dead spots in the void which refused to carry
the radio waves but occasionally word came through from
the moon they headed back toward earth encircled her and
then slowly returned to the flyers billet the whole trip had
taken sixteen hours it took a little less than eight hours
to make the journey to the moon traveling at a rate of 
miles an hour it was estimated that on a longer journey
where there was time to accelerate the machine more quickly
the mentor could travel at  miles per second or 
miles an hour

ready

the scientists were most enthusiastic about the mentor
and barring a few supplementary adjustments they advised
that it was ready for the long journey to venus immediately
upon their report an order was given for eleven more astral-
nautic flyers to be constructed the laboratories promised to
complete them in four months time in the meantime it be-
came the duty of the mentor to prepare crews for the other
ships under construction

  at the same time the laboratories were also at work upon
the construction of the several weapons the engineers had recom-
mended for use upon the flyers of all the inventions filed
away only two were to be given trial the first was a most
deadly ray called a a ray whose color was purplish-red
and which completely disintegrated all matter regardless of
its composition the second was explosive  whose power
was breath-taking six pounds of it were powerful enough to
demolish a whole mountain there was still a third weapon-
the one which the mentor trusted would be sufficient to subdue
the venusians without having recourse to the first two more
destructive weapons this was a new ray discovered by an
engineer a month before in trying to learn what power the
venusians had used to paralyze their captives as well as the

power-motors he had accidently found a device he called the
super-resonator that could destroy any machinery by causing
its molecules to be speeded up to such a degree that the machine
burnt into a thousand fragments the ray from the resonator
was a blue beam it had a spread of twenty feet and a range
of more than five miles the mentor recommended that that
ray be used in preference to the first two exterminators unless
it was to be found that the venusians were bent upon more
destructive measures when their planet was invaded



  seven months after the venusian descent the eleven new
space-flyers were ready for action they were each given a
trial trip in which they proved themselves equal to any strain
meanwhile twelve thousand flying men had been mobilized
care had been taken in selecting them from the thousands of
applicants as well as the twelve hundred men who were to
make up the crews of officers there were one hundred to
each ship with their commander the mentor as flag-ship
carried commander-in-chief ware who was to take over the
direction of the expedition san tu ackwa and yoto murca
were to accompany him in the role of technical directors a
group of astronomers with professor anton darcy at their
head were ordered to accompany the flyers by using a par-
ticularly short wavelength it was learned that radio communi-
cation between the twelve ships could be carried on in space

  finally the day came for the embarkation of the expedition
for venus again the mentor admonished ware to do no
more damage to the venusian than was necessary for the
recovery of the fifteen thousand abducted earthlings if pos-
sible an attempt was to be made to establish some peaceable
communication with the venusians i

chapter vi
a race through space

with the departure of the expedition the tele-visual
screens broadcast the stirring scene from lick as the
twelve ships in a v-shapcd formation set off into
space inasmuch as the two planets had been steadily moving
apart venus now lay  miles from earth journey-
ing at the rate of  miles per hour it would take them
nearly  days to reach the planet in its present position but
the planet would have moved further from the earth in the
meantime and the whole journey would take  days

  days long endless days of silence passed after the departure
of the ships and their brave crews through the great tele-
scopes the progress of the ships was watched with anxious eyes
and the news radioed to the millions of the earths people

  fifty days had passed when one day the weary observers
at their telescopes saw six ships emerge from the venusian
atmosphere and set their course in the direction of the oncoming
earth craft 

  was it a challenge was there to be a battle in space the
earths people held their breath during the following days as
the parties drew swiftly closer then they saw that the
venusian vessels had veered suddenly as though unaware of
the oncoming spheres there was what looked like panicky
movement among them as they suddenly dashed out in all
directions they were then seen to come together again beyond
the earthly ships sweep around them and head for home again

  meantime aboard the mentor commander-in-chief thomas
ware was also in a quandary through the televisual screens
that photographed all that went on outside the globes he had
watched the quiet approach of the enemy his orders for
preparation for battle rang out and drawing themselves more
closely for action the earthlings had waited then in surprise
they saw with what shock the venusians had met them as
they lost their formation separated then gathered together again


air wonder stories

and ran for home

   it was darcy who stated a decisive opinion of the meaning
of that maneuver apparently unaware that the earthlings
were preparing for war thfc venusians had waited only long
enough to discover the result of their experiments with their
fifteen thousand captives the results had been good and they
had prepared a half dozen flyers to descend upon earth again
and kidnap six times that number they were utterly routed
on discovering that the earthlings were on their way to venus
and they were hurrying back to their planet to warn their
cohorts such was darcys theory

   however the venusians did not descend to their planet but
appeared to be awaiting the arrival of the earthlings they
were merely keeping themselves a few thousand miles ahead
of the round globes that their ships were capable of a tre-
mendous speed was proved by the easy manner in which they
had encircled tbe earthlings now ware ordered their own
speed increased to its limit of  miles per hour imme-
diately the venusians increased their own determined no doubt
to keep their distance

this tvas vastly puzzling to the earthlings was it that
the venusians were awaiting reinforcements since they
were outnumbered two to one why were they content just
to keep ahead why should they wish their planet torn by
strife if reinforcements were not forthcoming were they
leading the earthlings into a trap it could scarcely be more
than strategy on their part i

   on on they continued with the venusians in full view bright
 lights marking their position the void was otherwise in-
 tensely black with the great shining ball of the sun glaring
 so brilliantly on their left as to blind anyone who dared to
 gaze directly into it the mighty corona was plainly visible
 and great prominences that shot out thousands upon thousands
 of miles into space professor darcy spent most of the
 journey viewing that great star through his dark glasses this
 was a year in which sun-spots were numerous and through
 a telescope of his own devising he watched a great spot that
 lay close to the latitude of six degrees he estimated it to
 be  miles across and was vastly put out that he had not
 brought some photographic plates with him

the earthlings speak

to the rear and somewhat to the left of them lay mother
earth now a bluish-white globe that to the voyagers ap-
peared to be the most beautiful sight in the great universe
gradually she had grown smaller and smaller as venus grew
larger on all sides could be seen the stars some so distant
that even our great sun would have appeared as but a pin-
point of light to them the fact that they could be seen at
all attested to their own tremendous size out in the void it
seemed as though a great many more stars could be observed
than from earth darcy explained that this was true since
the light of many of them did not penetrate earths atmosphere

   venus was now shining with a clear blue light and in another
two days and a half they would reach her it was then that
they saw a meteor hurtling directly in their path all through
the trip meteorites had been seen to drop on all sides of the
space-flyers and more than once they had had to swerve from
their path to avoid them yoto murca was even now studying
a method by which the spheres could be warned of their coming
since it became a nerve-racking task for the outlooks to
keep watch for the speeding missiles now as the meteor
appeared pandemonium reigned for a few minutes in the ships
but as the great mass was seen to pass hundreds of miles to
their left all fear was gone and they could only watch it in
awed wonder it appeared to be heading directly into the great
burning globe of the sun and though its head did pass through
the corona it was seen to pass beyond the star

 after another day had passed venus lay due ahead filling
  the entire prospect before them and as the earth ships
 approached they realized that the venusian ships had deliber-
 ately slowed down and were waiting for them planning to
 follow them into the great swirling cloud masses that were
 hiding the face of the planet against this blanket the ships
 could plainly be seen for hours now the spheres had been
 slackening their speed so that when they did reach the cloud
 masses they were not moving at more than five hundred miles
 per hour then further braking their speed they were swim-
 ming into the perpetual fogs of venus and their brightest head-
 lights were switched on in an effort to cut the mist occa-
 sionally through the swirls they could see one or another of
 the venusian machines and it was noticeable that they were
 leading them onward to some specific point of their world
 the space-flyers were put in readiness for an attack i
 they were now dropping steadily and when they estimated
 that they were  miles above the surface they saw a lake
 appear below although the earthlings did not at first recog-
 nize the ochraceous yellow substance as liquid only the wave-
 like motion proved this to be the case moving at an altitude
 of about five thousand feet the ship swept along no faster than
 one hundred and fifty miles per hour the venusian vessels
 were almost wholly visible for here close to the lake the
 clouds had cleared perceptibly it was then that commander
 ware ordered his ships prepared for battle a double v was
 formed with the mentor in the center the first two ships of
 the line were ordered to let loose the blue beam upon the hind-
 most venusian immediately the ship was seen to waver to
 race suddenly ahead then come to a halt before it plunged
 nose first down to the lake below it plunged into the yellow
 flood to bob back to the surface where it rolled and tossed
 with the waves the earthlings had spoken i

a strange battle

 as the single ship dropped to the water the other venusians
  went scurrying into the mists immediately ware sent
 out the order for four ships to follow and disable them as the
 first had been disabled it was then that a strange whistle
 sounded in the radio amplifiers on a longer wavelength than
 the earth ships had utilized and a friendly voice was heard

   greetings friends cried the voice in their own tongue
 on and at them but call your ships from the clouds there
 the zoldans have them bested i keep to sea level

   who is this speaking demanded the operator of the
 mentor

   dont bother about that now but call your ships down or
 in a minute it will be too late i

   ware who had been standing close to the amplifier wisely
 acted upon the order and hastened to recall the ships realizing
 that here was a friend who knew for a certainty what to ex-
 pect a minute thereafter two of the spheres were seen to
 drop from the clouds ware directed that they return to for-
 mation but they did not respond  instead they were falling
 straight down to the yellow ocean they took the plunge not
 far from the floating venusian throwing up waves and ipray
 then coming to the surface and rolling over and over

   sorry they got your ships observed the strange voice in
 the radio however their range is no greater than a mile
 or two so if you can reach them at a greater distance you are
 safe good luck to you

   it was evident that there were friends down on the planet
 who had managed to construct a radio equal to their own
 the two remaining scouts now appeared from the cloud banks
 and were being followed by the long cylindrical shapes of the
 venusian ships from the foremost ship appeared the wide
 blue beam that enveloped the leading cylinder which imme-
 diately took its plunge again the others ran into the clouds
 but this time the earth ships stayed close to the water waiting
 for them to make their appearance
women with wings



  down upon the ocean rolled the fallen earth ships bouncing
in response to the waves ware stared at the two disabled
spheres earful that his men had been killed but inasmuch
as the spheres were hermetically sealed he hoped that those
caught within were safe even if temporarily paralyzed by the
venusian rays it was then that he saw movement in the two
disabled cylinders riding the waves a hatch suddenly shot
open and out of it flew one after another of the people of
venus i

  others of the ships had seen them and were exclaiming
loudly at the strange forms they were winged and at first
the earthlings believed them to be their own people then
they realized that the difference lay in their covering which
had first been thought to be a type of clothing but on closer
inspection through the binoculars proved to be minute scales
that glistened iridescently in the half-lights that came through
the clouds head face arms and body as well as the long
straight wings were scaled exactly as a fish is scaled

  the second ship was also giving up its swarms of strange
life for a few minutes the winged beings hovered over their
ships then as if at the direction of a leader they flew to where
the two earth ships were being bulleted by the waves in
flight they had none of the grace of the winged men of earth
nor were they so swift then a swarm of them reached the
nearest sphere and were alighting on it from all sides they
seemed to examine it and not finding what tjiey wished a number
of the creatures dived into the water while others still clung to
the side in wonder the earthlings above saw the sphere roll
over on its side until its man-hole appeared immediately
the amphibians were at work upon the hatch seeking to learn
its secret

  all this had happened in such a short space of time that
the men in the ships above had been too stunned to think but
when the venusians or zoldans as the voice over the radio
had named them made an attempt to slip into their ships the
earthlings sprang into action ware ordered five of his ships
two of the remaining ships send their men to attack the ma-
to guard them from attack from above while he directed that
rauders they were each to carry their electro-thunderbolts but
orders were given to stun not kill for ware had come to the
sudden conclusion that the zoldan warriors were women

chapter vii

down to the water

on first reaching the atmosphere of venus the earth
scientists had taken samples of the air and discovered
that it was equal in atmospheric pressure to that of
earth with perhaps a slightly higher degree of oxygen now
with the hatches open the first squadrons of earthlings came
into the air and darted to where the venusians sought entrance
to the disabled sphere the second sphere had been attacked in
the same manner and it was evident that the women would
soon discover the secret of the entrances no doubt they thought
to control the space-flyers and attack the enemy with their own
ships

  acting under orders not to kill the earthlings dived to the
attack loosing their thunderbolts using half charges the
winged women saw them coming and half their number rose in a
cloud to meet the attack they appeared armed with rods a
foot long which let forth a sharp dart that plowed through
flesh and bone iut their darts did not climb well and it ap-
peared that the zomans were seeking to gain altitude a dozen
or so did manage to gain the air above the earthlings and their
darts found a number of victims sending them falling to the
water below but the earth thunderbolts spoke and sent the
venusians plunging into the ocean writhing and turning as they
fell

  now with the battle at its height below a venusian ship was
seen dropping from the clouds before the spheres were aware

of its proximity it had taken its toll and another flyer fell to
the water before it could gain cover of the clouds however a
blue beam from the menlor had caught it and after careening
uncertainly it too fell following its victim with a mighty splash
ware now ordered two ships to scout close to the clouds surface
and shortly thereafter another venusian ship fell from the fogs
that meant that there were only two more of the cylinders in
the clouds but though the spheres climbed warily into the
clouds they were unable to sight them

on the other hand the two fallen ships were giving up their
crews who upon discovering that the motors were power-
less were hurrying to join their fellows in the hand-to-hand
battle more and more of the earthlings were dispatched and
soon the water all around was literally covered by the floating
bodies of the amphibians as well as a great number of the winged
men who had been brought down by their darts either the aim
of the zoldan women was not good or else like the earthlings
they were bent only upon disabling the enemy for few of their
darts had given mortal wounds they lodged mostly in the
wing muscles or the limbs bringing the men to the water where
they were left to float or swim as best they could unlike the
women of venus the flying peoples of earth seldom if ever took
to the water hence after their first dousing in the yellow
ocean the earthlings were a sorry-looking people a number
of them went down before they could reach one of the floating
flyers to which they clung in droves the winged women on
the other hand who had been stunned by the thunderbolts usually
floated on the surface the effect of the charge of electricity
that they had received however did not so completely stun
them as to let them drown and after lying in the water for
fifteen or twenty minutes or so they could be seen reviving to
rise again to the attack with their sisters i
so might the battle have gone on indefinitely but for the fact
that there appeared to be more of the earthlings than of the
zoldans and the range of the thunderbolts was greater than
that of the darts used by the women there were always free
troops to be flung from the hovering spheres now the women
were attempting to make their escape spreading out in all di-
rections or else diving into the water and swimming until they
were out of range of the thunderbolts not showing themselves
above the water until they believed themselves safe i
then about five miles from the scene of the battle appeared
the fifth cylinder which quickly plunged to the water the
sphere that had brought it down hovered close above it waiting
for it to disgorge its warriors the two cruising scouts that
had been searching for the sixth cylinder returned to report to
the mentpr that the remaining ship was not to be found they
now dispatched their fighting men into the melee below but all
fight appeared to have left the beaten women and the earthlings
had to content themselves with capturing as many of the crea-
tures as they could first stunning them with the thunderbolts and
catching them in the air before they struck the water others
were sweeping down to the water in an effort to retrieve their
fellows who were still struggling in the water and to pull them
out without wetting their own wings some of the wounded
men in the water had managed to catch one of the amphibians
and forced their captives to support them in the water so they
would not drown

the strange voice

fofessor darcy aboard the mentor had been watch-
ing the whole strange affair through the floor of one of the
lounge rooms more than once he fiad been convulsed with
laughter he told san tu ackwa who was standing near him
i doubt that a stranger battle has ever been enacted in the
history of creation man and woman in battle each trying to
beat the other yet each trying to save the other for its own
benefit each wanting victory but not wishing to sacrifice the
other to gain its point i without a doubt we need each other


air wonder stories

but whether our people will be willing to accept these strange
creatures is a question still i guess these women are beautiful
in their own way but would a man be willing to see his off-
spring plunging into the ocean for its daily dip

   the japanese had nothing to say in answer to the astronomer
his serious mien revealed that he saw no humor in the others
levity darcy felt his disapproval and smiled wryly

   seriously speaking san he observed you must admit that
there has never been a queerer combat fought but see our
men are victorious after all i

   he pointed to the ocean below where they could see their
men rising to the spheres burdened with men and women alike
all fight was gone from the amphibians who were submitting
docilely enough to the capture darcy arose from his squatting
position on the floor and followed by san tu ackwa went
through the corridor that led to the spheres entrance here
were the returning men with their captives who were carried
to the chambers above

   commander ware was in his own quarters where he greeted
the scientists witha smile it appears that the victory is ours
he observed darcy recounted the enjoyment the battle had
brought him

   yet said ware we do not know but that reinforcements
are on the way surely these-these women havent shot their
entire bow they will come to succor their defenders one ma-
chine you know slipped away i am waiting now to learn how
many casualties we liave to report then we will search for
land

just then word was received from the commandants of the
spheres to announce that only fifteen men in all were missing
ware sighed sorrowful that even these had to be lost he
gave the order for several squads to descend to the spheres on
the water to discover whether the men were still living it
was then that the squeal of the radio announced the return of
their unknown friend on venus

   congratulations friends i it was a pretty fight  however
reinforcements setting out from    but with that the voice
halted as though the speaker had been torn from his machine
but the earthlings wore forewarned ware barked his orders
for a new formation just then the three crippled ships were
seen to lift themselves into the air again reports came from
them announcing that all was well aboard a great cry went
up from the remainder of the fleet when they had seen their fel-
lows once more rise to the air and again the ships were pre-
pared for battle the visual screens showed a half dozen cyl-
inders far off in the distance hurrying to where the earth ships
waited ware hesitated no longer he ordered that the ships
be brought down as soon as they came within range i
but again the shrill whistle of the venusian broadcaster was
to be heard the now familiar voice was more ringing and
exultant than before

   greetings to the valiant earthlings from waltia queen of
the zoldans i he cried waltia acknowledges the victors and
expresses a desire for a conference upon the isle of xora she
asks that you permit her ships to aid her defeated flyers you
have the word of the zoldans that you are safe in their midst
and a zoldan never breaks her word i one ship will guide you
to xora the others will come to take their ships in tow arc
you agreeable

  the commander signified that he was more than willing to
accept queen waltias terms and that the six approaching
cylinders were to be allowed to draw near unmolested he asked
more of the broadcaster but the repeated signals on his wave-
length brought no answer there was nothing for them to do
but follow the single ship that detached itself from the other
vessels and turned about preparatory to leading them to xora
were in for a strange experience ware smiled

   stranger than fiction darcy commented

  ware nodded

chapter viii

women with wings

as they followed they saw that the zoldan ships were
grappling the helpless cylinders with long metallic arms
that had upon their ends a great circular cup-shaped af-
fair which acted either through a suction or a magnetic field
as it fastened itself to the black sides of the crippled machines
and bore them aloft burdened so they could move but slowly
and were soon left far behind

   the navigators turned to their compasses which upon enter-
ing venus gravitational pull had reacted exactly as they had
upon earth proving that venus also had her magnetic pole
the compass showed that they were moving in a direction cor-
responding to east with a deviation to the south for three
hours they flew over the yellow ocean

  darcy suggested that the captive women in the mentor be
freed from their quarters for a closer examination so that they
might know more about the women of the planet in a few
minutes a half dozen or so of the scaled creatures were brought
forth they stood a little less than six feet in height and
appeared to be well proportioned the wings were not half so
long as earthly wings and were far less powerful for flying
evidently the zoldans did not take very long flights the fact
that they were scaled like fish pointed to the fact that they spent
a great deal more time in the water captive as they were
they appeard very docile and made no attempts to rebel against
their captors but the manner in which they held themselves
their arrogance of carriage and the pose of their heads showed
that they considered the men of earth an inferior grade of be-
ing moreover a certain patience of bearing was evident in
their faces and later darcy attested to the fact that he felt as
though they considered him naught but a child who needed some
humoring only one of the women wore any adornment upon
her person and that was a girdle of a bluish metal incrusted
with strange entrancing jewels no doubt she was a personage
as she held herself aloof from her fellows with the arrogance
on her face more marked than in the others

   had it not been for the minute scales that covered her face
and her head like a cap she would have been considered beauti-
ful according to earthly standards the eyes which were al-
most an emerald green were over-large and hidden fires seemed
to live behind them her nose was very small with nostrils that
scarcely appeared against the background of the glistening scales
and her mouth was of tiny proportions with its edges of the
same green color as the eyes the shape of her face was al-
most a perfect oval and the neck that supported the well-shaped
head was slender and well-poised upon the broad shoulders of a
swimmer her body was slender and deep-chested and the fact
that she was without breasts gave her a rather boyish figure
the most startling feature was the fact that between both her
fingers and her toes there were webbed membranes like those of
a duck

it was she of the girdle to whom commander ware now
addressed himself and yet from the beginning he had
known that they two could not converse unless she had managed
to learn something of the earthly speech from one of the men
they had captured from earth he did in fact address several
remarks to her but the woman made no attempt to answer but
stared with disdain upon her captor something like a faint
smile wreathing her strange lips

   not a bad-looking creature at that remarked darcy ap-
pears to have a great deal of spirit and little respect for the
genus man doesnt even trouble herself to attempt to converse
however something about the throat and lips tells me that these
women are not much given to speech perhaps they have no
spoken language the ears are very small and underdeveloped
too-better for receiving sound under water than atop like the
cars of the fish fish are not known to make any sound and
women with wings



unless i miss ray guess these zoldans are the direct descendants
from the teleostomi-in other words from common every-day
fish i

as the scientist spoke the woman turned her eyes upon him
and a smile more gentle than the one she had given ware was
flung to him later darcy admitted that he had had the feel-
ing that she had understood his every word and yet if she had
understood would her smile have been so kindly

now she was looking about the chamber in which she had
been received near at hand were the radio and visual screens
and her eyes lighted brightly as she saw the long shape of the
space-flyer of her own people moving ahead another screen
showed the water that lay below and beyond and upon both sides
the accompanying spheres of the earthlings at a desk to one
side of the room sat an officer with an array of instruments be-
fore him that he was manipulating as he gave directions to the
engine rooms and various other parts of the ship there was
no query in her eyes but understanding and something like ad-
miration too

ware seemed at a loss what to do with his guests but darcy
who had taken a liking to the strange woman managed to con-
vey to her that he would enjoy taking her about the flyer on a
tour of inspection she nodded in affirmation to his suggestion
and followed by the other women they made the trip darcy
pointing out to them whatever he thought would be of interest
to women acquainted with the science of space-flying ware
sighed with relief when they had left the commandants quarters

on venus

the ship was now nearing what appeared to be a low
shoreland and for two hours they followed it nothing
was moving on the sandy shores which were colored a deep
shade of orange it was a desolate-looking country without a
living thing to broak its monotony far inland could be seen
several dark splotches of purplish hue but whether or not these
were vegetation they could not tell twice they passed what
appeared to be small cities but different from any they had ever
seen cities that appeared to have been constructed of building
blocks such as a child plays with each block was of the same
black material as the zoldan space-flyers and was set in geo-
metrical arrangements and in no case were they higher than
two levels facing the water could be noted a single doorway
without another opening to break the smooth walls and in the
cities not a living creature was to be seen yet the earthlings
had the feeling that they were being watched

the sea coast was again left behind to the cast appeared
another long coast-line but they did not follow it but proceeded
due south over the water until they sighted a large island most
of the island was covered by the black blocks which made a
striking contrast against the background of the orange sand it
was in the exact center of the island that they saw a building
which differed from the rest of the city here in a square of
tremendous proportions with a black surfacing was set a large
square building and instead of the conventional black it was a
snowy white

once more the friendly voice was heard in the radio ordering
the ships to descend to the square in front of the white build-
ing ware directed their descent and one by one the spheres
settled to the ground in rows of three the mentor was the
last to land and stood facing the single doorway of the white
building the cylinder that had guided them hither was no
longer in sight

              chapter ix
              the matriarch

darcy had by this time returned from his tour with
the zoldans ware ordered that the women be returned
to the quarters set aside for them and turned to the

  	a class of fishes with well developed jawbones

matter of discmbarkment he and darcy and the two japanese
were the only ones to leave the mentor reaching the surface
of the square they saw that it was of a sleek metal and had
been laid in a single strip with no expansion strips with sur-
prise they noted that the building they were facing was transpar-
ent and that every article within was clearly visible from the
square  the black buildings also were found to be transparent
but their color made this feature less apparent and figures with-
in could barely be discerned

there was a great deal of movement within the palace of
queen waltia where figures moving back and forth or stand-
ing near the walls peered out upon the strange vessels of the
victorious earthlings then from the doorway came a small
band of women preceded by one who towered above the others
by almost six inches weird they were with their strange scaly
covering and their narrow scaled wings almost fantastic they
seemed to the earthlings

all of the twenty women were ornamented with girdles of
different designs vying with each other in splendor the girdle
of the foremost one was an exquisite bit of workmanship entirely
covered by jewels of all shapes and colors many of which were
hues never seen in precious stones upon earth the woman
herself was a striking creature statuesque and beautifully pro-
portioned with a face that appeared chiseled from living stone
her eyes of emerald however were almost too large for beauty
and her mouth was uncommonly small

she came to a halt with her party within ten feet of the group
awaiting her and stood there quietly without a word surveying
them as they surveyed her it was then that the earthlings per-
ceived that in her retinue there was a familiar figure one of
their own race

at a motion from the queen-for she was indeed waltia-the
earthling detached himself from the group and after extend-
ing his left arm toward the woman in some manner of salute
addressed his fellow-men

the matriarch extends her greeting and her good-will to the
people of earth he declared she wishes to express her deep
admiration for men who have so bravely attacked her formidable
craft and she observes that it is indeed surprising to her that
beings of our sex show great courage as well as such an array
of scientific knowledge she feels that after all even though
you be men she need not be shamed by your victory over her
warriors for you are undoubtedly people of great accomplish-
ment i

the last was said with a broad smile which the matriarch
as the interpreter saw fit to call her did not see since he
was facing his fellow-men

ware could not help but smile with him we of earth
on the other hand observed the commander are equally sur-
prised to learn that queen waltia has such a poor opinion of
our sex we arc also astounded that the female of the species
has proven such a worthy foe to the lords of creation i he
said this with a little smirk he could not keep from his lips it
had been many centuries since men had used those terms but
he felt that the occasion called for them

turning to the queen the interpreter began in a strange hum-
mining tone to explain what the commander had said they saw
the smile play upon the womans lips she too recognized the
irony of his remarks then she took a step forward and ex-
tended her right hand to ware the earthling had no doubt
demonstrated to her the earthly manner of salute the com-
mander stepped forward and took her hand in his if he had ex-
pected to find her flesh cold to his touch he was mistaken for
it was warm and vibrant with health and her clasp was hearty

with that done she turned to the earthling at her side and
the same humming sound that had come to his lips now slipped
from hers he interpreted her words her majesty suggests
that perhaps it would be well for you to permit your men to
descend from their cramped quarters there is nothing to fear


air wonder stories

as she lias given her word guaranteeing their safety they are
given the freedom of the planet i

  nodding ware turned to the mentor and waved an arm im-
mediately one of his officers appeared and the order was given
for the men to land

  we are holding approximately three thousand women cap-
tive he advised the queens interpreter and i would prefer
to keep them prisoners until we learn what terms we may reach
with the matriarch i trust she will be agreeable to that condi-
tion 

  the other nodded her majesty is aware of the fact that you
retain her fellow-women until suitable terms can be made
he answered without bothering to address the queen

kiter explains

now one by one the spheres were being emptied of their
crews in each a small detail of men were to be left to
guard the women the men quickly fell into formation and
stood at attention awaiting the next command of their leader
ware gave the order for them to relax while he looked for in-
structions from the queens interpreter

  arrangements have already been made for the quartering of
your men within the houses that face the square which have
been vacated for that purpose there they will be looked after
by the women however it will be quite agreeable to her
majesty if you prefer to leave a number of your men to guard
your machines although that precaution is entirely unnecessary

  as for yourself and your party the matriarch will be pleased
to have you accompany her to the palace where we can discuss
the present situation ill comfort

  ware nodded and gave directions to his officers for the care of
the men then with professor darcy and san tu ackwa and
yoto murca he followed the queen and her retinue to the white
transparent palace the doorway was a circular opening with
a crystal of tremendous size suspended in lieu of a door it
was cut with exquisite care and its facets caught and reflected
the half-lights that filtered through the ever-present tloud banks

  the building itself was a great rectangle measuring fully a
thousand by two thousand feet and was three levels high com-
ing through the doorway they found themselves in a room of
large proportions with no furnishings other than an immense
throne chair set on a dais at the opposite side of the room it
was of a deep emerald green color and appeared to have been
cut from a single stone through the walls of the room they
could plainly see the square beyond with the spheres and men
now maneuvering in answer to their officers commands they
did not pause in this chamber but went directly through to a
second room here at the doorways were stationed women who
stood at attention as the company came through in the third
room which was furnished simply with a dozen large chairs
with the backs cut low to provide room for the wings to dangle
to the ground behind the queen halted all but one of her fol-
lowers went on through the next doorway and were seen to
arrange themselves upon chairs in the adjoining room turning
to her guests waltia motioned for them to be seated the
earthly interpreter took his position at her chair later he gave
his name as jack kiter he had been a metallurgist on a holi-
day at miami at the coming of the zoldan flyer to earth and
had had the misfortune to be captured by the winged women
only he did not appear to consider it a misfortune as the others
were presently to discover

immediately after they had seated themselves comfort-
ably a half dozen women who unlike the others wore no
girdles came in bearing small tables upon each of which was
set a single yellow bowl and beside it a long pencil-shaped wand
with prongs at one end a table was set before each man
happening to glance behind him ware was surprised that he
could see out into the square almost as clearly as if three walls
did not intervene there he could see hundreds of flying women

moving among his men bearing trays of yellow bowls the
bowl set before him he found to contain a thick greenish liquid
in which were floating a number of bits of what looked like
boiled flesh the flesh was a vivid red

  the zoldans observed kiter from his post beside the
queen live entirely upon water-life-fish squids sea serpents
and other forms of life which i am unable to name sea-wccds
of different varieties are ground into a sort of flour and baked
though one or two varieties are eaten in their raw state you
will find this dish tasty

  the earthlings stared at the food a little questioningly but
when they saw the queen spearing the flesh lumps with her
strange fork they did likewise and were surprised that the food
was rather good although the fish flavor was strong when
the solid food was gone they looked up to see what their hostess
would do next and saw that she had already put the bowl to
her lips to drink the liquid it was stinging hot but it had an
aromatic flavor that was refreshing with the food consumed
the dishes and tables were removed and the visitors waited for
what was to come next

chapter x

a strange race

the queen had turned to kiter and for several moments
her humming tones persisted then the interpreter began
to speak to his fellow-men queen waltia wishes me
to tell you something about her world which is called by her
people zolda it is a world composed mostly of water and what
land there is lies grouped loosely together in islands there are
still a great many of these islands that have never been visited
to the earthly eye it is a strange world with its ochre yellow
seas its orange sand its purple red and blue foliage much
of the ocean bed is very shallow although there are regions in
which the bottom has never been reached but on the whole it is
no more than from six to seven fathoms in depth

  it is natural therefore that the zoldans should liave had
their beginnings in the water their scientists like those of
earth still seek for the missing links in their history in fossils
found for the most part in the silt on the bottom of the oceans
at first the life of the zoldans was spent under the surface but
in water so shallow it is not strange that they should have lifted
themselves out of that element by their wings which were de-
veloped from finny appendages along the backbone

  in the beginning they merely skimmed the water for a dis-
tance of eight to ten feet before they dropped back into it much
as do the flying-fish of our own oceans then gradually the
fins changed to wings that could lift them a little higher and
to a greater distance at the same time they were developing
their lungs until they could if they wished live almost entirely
out of the water in the heavy moist atmosphere of their world
you can sec the small gill slits that you perhaps have taken for
ears by which they breath the oxygen in the water when they
are swimming under the surface now they can no longer stay
below the water more than half an hour to an hour at a time
for gradually through the ages as their lungs have developed
at the expense of their gills they have been losing their ability
to live as amphibians

  it may astonish you also to learn that they have  organ of
hearing instead the voice sets up a scries of vibrations in the
very sensitive nerves of the skin surface and these register upon
the brain loud noises are vastly disturbing to their delicate
nervous system for this reason we have discovered that music
and singing are very pleasant to them and they have looked
forward to our perfection of the radio upon which a number of
our people have been working

v tow the zoldans live entirely upon the sea coast and

  x rarely go inland except to mine the various metals with
which they have learned to work it is from the water that
women with wings



they obtain their food and it is upon the water that they breed
their young for the zoldans are an egg-bearing race and their
eggs have to be incubated in the water it takes three months
for the young to hatch and much care is given them in specially
built vats in sheltered coves along the seashores

  the strangest feature of the zoldans is that from the very
beginning of time the female has always been the dominent sex
the male being accepted by them only as a biological necessity
as an intelligent being he is practically nil he is physically a
weakling so that all labor falls upon the shoulders of the
women and now for many ages man has been slowly dying
out for although the women have done all they could to save
the sex there seems nothing to save him and his birth-rate is
very low-only one male to every so -females born there is also
a disease that attacks the grown males for which there seems
no cure the zoldans therefore are faced with a problem that
equals that of our own planet and the raid they made upon us
was simply a means to save their race they had visited mer-
cury for this purpose before they tried the earth but there
was no life upon that little planet of course they were elated
on discovering not only that earth was inhabitated but also
tliat its peoples were winged like themselves

  we captives have had a difficult time m striving to prove
to them that man can be the equal of woman and they are
now grudgingly admitting that this is so your feat today in
besting them lias proved to them that they are not superior to
us

  when their ships met you out in the void they were as-
tounded to learn that you had succeeded in conquering space
but they believed that once you arrived on their planet they could
paralyze all your ships and capture you easily they them-
selves were bound for earth to make a second and larger cap-
ture for they had now completed their experiments and dis-
covered that they could successfully breed with us naturally
enough when they found that you were arriving with thousands
of men they were content that you were bringing yourselves
to them and saving them the journey to earth i consequently
they were wholly unprepared for your attack on them

  but since you have proved yourselves worthy of their mettle
and since you like themselves have a scarcity of the opposite
sex they are willing to capitulate and make a fair exchange
with you-to send to earth just as many of their women as
earth will give of men

the truce

e who have been captured have agreed that this is a
solution to our problems zolda or venus as we call
her has much to give to earth besides her women and earth
can fairly exchange with her the planet has wonderful re-
sources many of which still remain untapped there arc metals
and jewels tliat will be invaluable to earth metals of such
hardness and lightness that they would indeed be of a value
that now seems incredible i and in return earth has much to
offer venus in several branches of science the zoldans have
leen backward because they lack some of the necessary equip-
ment but if our peoples would be willing to make exchanges
the inhabitants of both planets could progress along lines that
in the past would have seemed like miracles 

  you will find the women of venus a happy pleasant populace
who for all their science are almost childlike in some matters
they are anxious now for our two worlds to become friends
and they will do all they can to bring this about and they
plead that the earthlings forgive their temerity in having dared
to capture what earthlings they did for it was done through
sheer ignorance upon their part they believed the men of
our world to be the same weak creatures that men are on their
world and did not dream to find them as intelligent and as ad-
vanced as themselves i

when kiter had concluded his narrative the earthlings were

silent the story they had heard was indeed a strange one
they knew not what to answer queen waltia true here was
a solution to their own problem ready to hand but would the
people of earth be willing to accept these strange amphibians
in their midst and would the intermingling of these bloods
be practical would not such an interchange cause a strange
race to come into being upon their own fair globe would it
not mean that the habits of the earthlings must be changed
would it not affect their whole manner of living would they
continue to be the great fair-minded race that they were at the
present time it was indeed a momentous decision that the
earthlings were called upon to makel
quietly the four men discussed these questions among them-
selves kiter had explained that the matriarch would not ob-
ject to their conversing together apart he was listening quietly
himself but after a few minutes he addressed a question to
waltia she nodded at what he had to say and gave an order
to one of the attendants standing in the doorway a minute
later the woman came back carrying what turned out to be a
young zoldan or rather a child that was of both zoldan and
earthly parentage

it was a child of about two months but it had the appearance
of a year-old youngster its face was that of an earthly
child with fair skin but its eyes were abnormally large while
its body was covered with the tiny fish scales that caught the
light and reflected it like a prism its hands had no webs but
its wings resembled those of its maternal race shorter and
slenderer with none of the power of the earthling wings the
wings were almost wholly covered with scales except where
they joined the body where there was a suggestion of soft
down that would grow into feathers as it grew older

  the four men examined the child carefully it was a pleasant
baby and showed great interest in the strange men they ex-
amined the wings which they thought were poor substitutes
for their own wings but darcy was certain that were they
developed properly they could be made to grow stronger per-
haps the earths scientists could increase them with their glands
and formulas as mentor had first evolved wings upon a wing-
less people still to the earthlings the baby was a queer
little thing and its appearance was somewhat distasteful to their
fastidious minds the queen who had been watching their de-
ception of the child and their examination turned again to her
attendant who went away to do her bidding she returned with
a second child they saw that this one was entirely free from
scales on the trunk and limbs but that his round head was
capped with them instead of hair and that the wings though
larger than the first babys were completely covered with them

  this child explained kiter is bom of an earth mother
and a zoldan father for you know that there were a number
of our women in our midst when we were captured the mother
died when the baby was bom for unlike the other child he was
born from the mother instead of from an egg

  hm   meditated darcy it would be more interesting
to see what several generations of these offspring would bring
kiter spoke several moments to the queen and then addressed
his fellow-men her majesty can not quite understand your
hesitancy in accepting these children but she agrees that it
would be well first for the matter to be brought up before the
planet ruler she would suggest therefore that you return to
earth with a dozen or so of her women and their offspring to
be taken before the mentor in the meantime however she
insists that she keep on zolda the men she has captured if the
earthlings decide against the importation of the zoldan women
she will return all the earthlings who wish to return to their
otm planet i the decision will rest with you who are the vic-
tors and if you do not wish to breed with her people she still
hopes that the earthlings will be willing to accept her people as
friends and allow commerce to be carried on between the two
worlds she has learned already that her people need us and

above all the zoldans are fair-minded they do not begrudge
you your victory but admit that you have beaten them fairly

    the four men conferred together for several moments and
agreed that the terms were more than fair but first they had
to learn whether their people were content upon the strange
world until the planet ruler could come to a decision kiter
smiled at that very few of the captured earthlings it seemed
were rebelling against their loti there was so much here to
interest them that they had scarcely had time to feel any pangs
of homesickness and they were finding that the amphibians
were congenial mates i

a night on venus

hile they had been speaking the night had been de-
scending upon the planet although a shaded light still
lingered in the heavens there had been a magnificent
sunset as the rays of the sun were reflected upon the upper
cloud banks painting them in gorgeous colors that ranged from
vermilion reds to dark violets the men had only to lift their
eyes above and see it all through the transparent ceilings of the
room and the roof two levels above theni

  for many centuries earthlings had questioned whether or not
venus rotates upon her axis or whether like mercury it has
but a single rotation during its solar year

  now with the coming of night the matriarch spoke again
through her interpreter the zoldans retire with the setting
of the sun gentlemen the latter explained although they do
have artificial light they seldom utilize it preferring to sleep
with the suns setting and awake with its rising i am directed
to escort you to your sleeping chamber

  they saw that the queen was rising from her chair and with a
nod of her head she was gone followed by her attendants who
had been waiting in the adjoining room ware was first anxious
to learn whether his men had been cared for and kiter pointed
to the square which with the exception of the spheres and the
few men left to guard them was deserted he assured the
commander that he had no need to worry about his battalions
but that the women had their care at heart then he led them
down a corridor to an inclined ramp that took them to the
second floor of the palace to a large room wherein were half a
dozen couches for their use all around them through the walls
they could see the rooms filled with couches upon which women
were already sleeping beyond the walls they could see the
square black blocks of houses whose walls were less trans-
parent

   i believe conjectured darcy that there is an old proverb
that tells us people who live in glass houses shouldnt throw
stones 

kiter grinned only professor these houses are not of
glass  but of metal i almost all zoldan metals are
transparent the black metal that is called ctilula is only semi-
opaque and is used as the general rule for building the space-
flyers are built of it but since their early history the palaces of
their rulers have always been built of liclula ior the simple
reason that all the world can watch their movements and there
can be no treachery  and one simply becomes accustomed to
having every movement seen by his fellow-man he is then not
so apt to break the laws or to hold secrets i

  not a half bad idea at that 

  how is it that they use no lights demanded san to
ackwa

  they have in the first place little use for lighting and
strange as it may seem they have never developed their natural
resources to a very great extent fire is rarely used by them
and electricity is an unknown quantity in cooking as well as
for generating power they use atomic heat having a means
of disintegrating the atoms through a cosmic ray whose base

 i	have not as yet been able to learn with it they drive their
 engines and motors but they have not as yet learned how to
 produce light when they need light they use a strange phos-
 phorescent stone that sends off a small glow by a unique array
 of mirrors and lenses they are able to focus this glow and so
 to obtain a tremendous amount of light which they are enabled
 to direct in any direction they desire it takes great care and
 fine workmanship to grind the proper lenses so one can readily
 see why light is not generally used in their homes

   and what type of ray was it that they used for paralyzing
 you when you were captured and in the radio and power
 plants

   that is not a ray but a gas that is found below the ocean
 beds when using it the zoldans cover their heads with masks
 and breathe from oxygen tanks the gas docs not affect their
 engines as it does ours why it should react upon our motors
 and not theirs is a problem that dr howard cross is working
 upon in fishing for the sea creatures which they use for food
 this gas is used since it permeates the water as well as the air
 -even more readily in fact it paralyzes the creatures but does
 not kill for the zoldans will not eat food which is not put into
 the kettle alive

   it seems to me observed darcy that for a people so
 versed in certain fields they are sadly lacking in knowledge in
 others

kiter confesses

 kiter nodded yes it is strange that they have not carried
 their development evenly along all lines nor would you
 consider them a cultured people by earths standards they
 have no music no recreational amusements of any kind and
 they are not at all interested in education they have no written
 language and their mode of accounting seems childish yet they
 have a great amount of native shrewdness and they are quick
 to grasp a subject once it is laid out before them furthermore
 their understanding of mechanics without a mathematical back-
 ground is phenomenonal you must have noticed also that
 their manner of speech is very crude i consider in fact that
 their backwardness in various subjects is due to their lack of an
 organized coherent language there are actually no distinct
 word sounds but the inflections of the voice and the narrowing
 and opening of its volume mean innumerable things to them
 it was most difficult for us of earth to learn at all and only
 a few of us have really mastered it we often have much dif-
 ficulty in giving names to objects and the names i have given
 you are really of our own devising based upon their own
 sounds

   you appear to get along well with the queen kiter

   he grinned broadly in the dark oh we understand each
 other thats all what i told you of their history took me
 quite a while to learn but these women have all the patience
 in the world and will tire themselves out in an attempt to teach
 us what they want us to learn they are as anxious to learn
 as we are ourselves and i have managed to teach waltia a few
 words of our language she is quick to learn but it means a
 great amount of time spent in developing the vocal cords i
 really doubt that she will ever become an orator but her voice
 tones are beautiful for all that and she has given us permis-
  sion to teach the offspring of our two races to speak the two
 little tykes you saw can really talk a blue streak already but
 they are rather shy with strangers the young develop very
 quickly

   but tell us kiter honestly are you content in this gray
 misty world dont you miss a sight of the sun once in a
 while and dont you long to breathe the clear fresh air of the
 mountain tops surely you dont find this world half so pleasant
 as earth

 when kiter answered his voice was wistful yes it is
 true that we miss that more than we care to say and we
women with wings



 all have the hope that one day we may return home still on
 the other hand all that seems humdrum now and zolda does
 not leave us time to feel any monotony as for color this world
 is filled with it and wffen we grow tired of the water we can
 fly for many miles over strange landscapes as for music we
 shall soon broadcast good programs for george morrow now
 has his radio completed and is busy at the present time install-
 ing his first great station and he has a corps of men and women
 at work building the receiving sets after all life on earth
 flows in well-oiled unchanging streams while here there is still
 great adventure to be found and we have not yet reached the
 point where we will tire no life is quite enjoyable here on this
 strange world and its women are pleasant

  i see after all there is little in the way of home ties on
earth to hold you and you have here a world almost in the
making i could almost envy you said commander ware

  and  by the way about that radio was it this george
morrow whose voice gave us warning

  kiter nodded and the women almost murdered him when
they learned what he was about to them radio is almost a
magic science and when they first discovered its possibilities
they were overjoyed with it but when they discovered that
he had dared to warn his fellow-beings they were furious
however waltia intervened she did not consider his act one
of treason for she admits that in his place her women would
have done the same i she was astounded to learn that she could
watch the battle taking placc in the visual screen which morrow
had perfected so that the scene was projected to his machine
by the background of the clouds overhead morrow jf you
recall was the co-inventor of a number of improvements of the
tele-visual waltia watched the entire battle by its means and
it was she who gave directions for him to declare a truce and
to invite you to xora

  hml i wonder if our people would have been so magnani-
mous in a like circumstance history rarely tells of souls so
great and understanding as she 

  it is true i have never met a woman or a man for that
matter who shows such a breadth of mind and soul

  you call her the matriarch is that the term her people
use

  no she is merely their ruler they have no word sound
for queen or anything to designate their leaders but hers is
truly a qucenship or matriarchy there are other leaders among
them women who hold their position because of heritage but
waltia is acknowledged their ruler for through her own
superiority of leadership she outranks them all those who
wear the girdle are of the nobility lines among them the others
are the commanders but really there is no other distinct line
drawn all work for the common good

  but gentlemen if you will pardon ray interruption i would
suggest that you get some sleep now the nights of zolda are
not over-long due to the thick atmosphere which radiates the
suns heat long before the sun has arisen tomorrow waltia
wishes that you be taken on a tour of inspection and i dont
doubt but that you are in need of rest

  the men agreed that they needed sleep and began to settle
themselves on the couches which were extremely soft ex-
amination of the texture of the cloth that covered them and of
the blankets revealed that they were woven of a species of sea-
weed that still retained a sweet though elusive odor kiter
waited only for the earthlings to be settled before he took him-
self off they could see him moving in the gloom several rooms
away then all was quiet as the weary men dropped off to
sleep

chapter xii
morning

as kiter had said the night was short and dawn came long
before the sun rose when ware and his fellows awoke
l the sky was being painted in beautiful colors far more

lovely than it was possible for any sunrise upon earth to be
and through the ceiling and roof above the earthlings watched
the shifting shades as they crept from cloud to cloud then
recognizing their surroundings again after the first surprise of
the unfamiliar scene they looked about them and saw that the
sleepers in the rooms about had already arisen looking through
the floor they could see jack kiter seated in a chair awaiting
their arising no doubt in fact as they arose he looked up and
saw them and waved a hand then he went hurrying up the
ramp to their chamber

  he greeted them brightly sorry we have no better accommo-
dations here there is no running water to be had he advised
but after clapping his hands four of the zoldan women appeared
bearing round bowls filled with water there were towels of
the woven sea grasses

  after their ablutions in the tepid soft water they were ready
to descend below in the square they found the spueres just as
they had been left the night before all deserted except for
their guards on looking seaward they were now greeted by a
strange sight above the square blocks of the black houses
could be seen thousands upon thousands of the winged women
in the air diving and cavorting in a queer manner

   come said kiter if you wish to see our hostesses at their
morning bath you see during the night the air cools a great
deal and becomes rather dry and it is necessary for the zoldans
 keep their flesh damp much of their breathing is through
their pores and as in the frog that is impossible if the skin is
dry hence it is a morning rite with them to go down to the
water for their bath they become quite sluggish if they are
kept from the water

  taking wing the five flew over the house tops to the sea
shore they could now see that the ocean was dotted with
amphibians the zoldans would soar several hundred feet in
the air then close their wings and drop like plummets into the
water throwing the spray high for a few minutes they would
play in the water surfacing diving and swimming several
yards beneath the surface to rise again and repeat the plunge
along the beaches standing in the surf were a number of women
with babies in their arms whom they would carefully lower
into the water for the space of a minute to one side of the
gathering they could see a number of half-grown zoldans
imitating their mothers only their play was more exciting as
they chased ch other in short races

r you know observed darcy that we havent seen

  	j a single male zoldan  they are evidently very scarce
or do they keep apart from the women

  in answer kiter scanned the crowds and from time to time
pointed out a single scaly man or two in a group they were
slightly smaller than the women

  down the beach ware noted a band of his soldiers standing
by and watching their hostesses with much glee on seeing their
leader several officers detached themselves from the group and
approached commander ware they reported that all was well
with their battalions the three captains of the ships which
had been paralyzed by the zoldan gas made their appearance
they reported that their ships were little the worse for their
experience only one of their number the skylark lad received
any damage two of the plates of the outside shell had sprung a
leak but only a small amount of water had seeped in the
captain had ordered that a number of his men repair the damage
immediately and he was certain that all would be well with it
henceforth on learning of the accident the two japanese in-
ventors were troubled and excusing themselves from the group
hurried to examine the damage later upon hearing about the
matter the matriarch ordered that a coating of ceilula the
black metal of the zoldans be used to seal the break the stuff
was brought in a liquid form and applied like a paste in less
than half an hour it hardened and nothing was found that could

chip it to ascertain that the work had been done correctly the
queen examined it herself

   shortly after the earthlings had arrived on the beach the
winged women had returned from their bath kiter lead his
party into the palace and in the room where they had been
received the day before they were served their breakfast this
consisted of a sweetish bread made from sea-weeds and a drink
that was of a white color and tasted like milk kiter explained
that it was indeed the milk of a sea-mammal tliat resembled
an earthly whale large icrds of these creatures were kept by
the zoldans

ready to return

it was after the meal that ware recalled the women whom
the earthlings had been holding captive within the spheres
he was apologetic about having held them thus long directions
for their release were sent to one of the officers of the fleet and
the women were set free darcy looked for the girdled woman
who had intrigued his fancy and learned that she ranked only
below queen waltia she appeared to hold no animosity toward
her captors and after she had returned from her morning bath
in the sea she presented herself to the queen and her guests

  it was she who elected to accompany the earthlings with
kiter on a tour of inspection around the island kiter gave her
name as kal on meeting her late captors she had greeted
them with a smile and a single word upon her lips-hello 
it turned out that one of the guards who had been left in the
sphere with the women had painstakingly taught her this 
her voice was melodious the s liquid and she had managed
to give the word a wealth of tone she appeared to be on good
terms with kilter and several times she laughed at something
he told her in their odd humming sounds

   that day was spent in visiting many buildings that housed
various kinds of factories on the far end of the island which
was approximately fifteen miles long were large smelting vats
where the raw ore of the ceilula was turned into liquid and then
into small blocks which could be liquified again when it was
needed they saw the mills that turned out many of the neces-
sities used by the zoldans and the sheds where the zoldan eggs
were hatched here were the incubators for those of common
birth where thousands of the eggs were placed in a foot of
water that was kept at a proper temperature the eggs were
soft and measured but three inches when first put in the in-
cubators but they grew until they reached eighteen inches in
length then the shell grew hard until the time when the
youngster was ready to be hatched there were many varieties
of incubators for the offspring of the various ranks among the
women only those of the queens were kept wholly apart and
were known to their own mothers in all other cases the mother
on depositing an egg in the vats was given a card that entitled
her to a child when hatching time came

that afternoon the zoldan world was treated to the first
public broadcasting of the new radio station on the planet
amplifiers had been set up in various parts of the cities at the
most strategic points to the earthlings much of what went on
was unintelligible as it was in the zoldan language but they
did enjoy a short progam of singing or rather humming in
which a dozen zoldans took part their harmony was strange
to the earthly ears but as kiter said it was a big step for
the zoldans and it had taken several months for howard rath
who had been a musical instructor in the florida conservatory
to teach the women to sing together in tune

  one more night the earthlings spent upon zolda the next
morning after the swim the matriarch received them in the
throne room seated upon the chair that was cut from a single
jewel the assembly chamber was filled to overflowing and
outside in the square were crowded the thousands that could
not find room in the chamber the announcement of the terms
of treaty that had been accepted by commander ware was re-

peated in the zoldan language and the names of the two dozen
women who were to go to earth were announced a half dozen
of the earthlings that had lived for the past eight months on
the planet were toaccompany their fellows to explain just what
they had discovered about the zoldans and to demonstrate to
the planet ruler the uses of the varieties of strange metals that
were being shipped on the spheres to earth waltia was also
sending a large assortment of jewels as a tribute to the earth-
lings

  she made a long speech that was translated by kiter to the
effect that she was anxiously looking forward to a brotherhood
with the earthlings and trusted that in the future both worlds
would receive benefit from such a union

  then they left the council chamber to go into the square
the crews and fighting battalions were waiting at attention for
the order to embark into the spheres a salute was given the
zoldans and then quietly and in orderly fashion they filed into
the space-flyers the band of zoldan women with the children
that were to accompany them were taken into the mentor
with them went the six earthlings who were to act as inter-
preters darcy was first to note that the girdle-wearer kal
was among the women he turned to kiter why dont you
come with us too he inquired

the long journey

kiter saw fit to blush then he stammered sorry but
theres a great deal for me to do here besides you see
her majesty has taken rather a liking to me    and were
great friends i think i can do more here than upon earth
soon well have our radios and tele-visual perfected so that
communication between earth and venus will be a fact

  well good luck and bon voyage  as they used to say 
almost with regret darcy saw the island of xora fade
through the mists as they took their course upward again he
was sorry they had not spent more time upon the planet for
he felt that he had really learned very little about it however
he promised himself that he would return with the next ex-
pedition and perhaps he could arrange to stay on the world for
several years there was something for the astronomers to
learn here about lens grinding 
soon the swirling cloud-banks of venus or zolda rather
faded away to the right of them glowed the great sun earth
lay ahead a beautiful shining planet that to the earth men far
surpassed the beauty of its fellow-worlds even that strangely
lovely planet of mars whose brilliant color out in the void was
that of blood the trip home was made more quickly than the
outcommg one had been and was wholly uneventful

  upon the mentor the only diversion came from their guests
the women had been given the entire run of the ship and their
interpreters were never idle as the women inquired into every-
thing kal had set about to learn more about the controls of
the sphere than she had discovered on her first trip therein
and she seemed determined to learn the earthly tongue con-
tinually demanding the names of every object in sight to which
she pointed with her webbed fingers darcy who had been so
taken with the woman resolved that just as soon as it could be
possibly arranged he intended to ask for permission to adopt
her if she would be agreeable to such an arrangement he had
never married and was without a single tie kal he thought
would be a daughter who would be a nver ending source of
enjoyment she too seemed to have taken a great liking to the
astronomer and appeared to derive some comfort when in his
presence among these men of a strange world

the children the women had brought gave a great deal of
pleasure to the crew of the mentor for they were lively
little things one in particular was already attempting to crawl
and his large bright eyes were always questing for something
to hold his attention jestingly they called him venus how-
women with wings



ever the last few hours of the journey were anything but
pleasant to him since one of the soldiers daringly handed him a
piece of chocolate which he immediately devoured the women
had been feeding the babies entirely on the milk of the sea-
cows of their world which they carried in sealed bottles and
the chocolate was wholly indigestible to the little fellow the
woman who had charge of the baby cast angry glances at the
miscreant and more than one man liad his hands slapped when
in a joke they attempted to feed more chocolate to the other
youngsters

  the long days of the journey had passed and now they were
reaching earth just outside of earths atmospheric blanket
communication with earth was established and thereafter they
were constantly in touch with their fellows the mentor and
his staff were waiting in the wide square before the government
seat in havana and great crowds for many miles about awaited
the landing of the spheres as the spheres one by one disem-
barked their crews arms reached out for the travelers as the
delighted earthlings crowded around

  ware with his officers and the group of scientists were re-
ceived in an open clearing maintained by guards little talking
could be done in the hubbub of sound that swelled and beat on
the ears and the police had difficulty in forcing open a path
by which they could reach the quiet of the building beyond to
make their reports it was then that a strange and terrific noise
burst forth causing ware in sudden fear to look around for the
group of zoldans who under the guard of their interpreters
should have been walking behind he saw that they were not
in sight    then he found them

  in the centcr of the square was a fountain with a fairly large
sized pool a great crowd had gathered there and were ex-
citedly screaming and gesticulating pointing at something in
the water ware and darcy with the mentor following close
behind unaware of what had happened flew above the heads
of the milling masses to the fountain they were astounded
to find that the twenty-four women with their babies were all
lying prone in the water while the six men whose duty it was
to care for them were trying to force the laughing crowds to
silence

earth again i

a

t wares query charlie west who had the women in his
charge explained that the noise of the crowds had been

too much for the women who were unaccustomed to loud
grating sounds and they were merely seeking quiet under the
water they had smelt the presence of water and had flown
to it by an unerring intuition

  the mentor immediately dispatched orders for the square to
be cleared and the crowds quieted when the noise eventually
died down the women were enticed from the pool a house
adjoining that of the planet ruler was immediately made ready
for them there in the patio was a small fountain which the
mentor ordered removed and a large pool constructed for the
use of the women

  for three days the earthlings celebrated the return of the
space-flyers although any noise was forbidden within several
thousand yards of the house wherein the zoldans were quar-
tered memorial services were also said for the fifteen men who
had died in the battle on venus

  the mentor took up the business of studying the zoldan
situation a number of the women and children were sent on
a tour of the world and scientists made thorough examination
of them but it was many years before it was agreed that the
earthlings were to breed with the zoldans first of all trade
was established between the two planets and the earthlings
learned to look with favor upon the amphibians however
after several generations of cautious co-mingling it was found
that the inter-breeding was beneficial to the race women no
longer had to die in giving birth to their young and the presence
of scales on their bodies was not distasteful to the new race
nor were the earthlings to become amphibians for each new
generation turned to the water less and less as time passed

  in the meantime the earthlings upon zolda gave reciprocal
service to that world so that in time there was scarcely any
difference to be noted between the two races and an earthling
traveling to the beautiful planet found life almost identical with
that of his own world

  it was now thought that the time was ripe for an earthly
expedition to descend upon mars to learn whether its people
were receptive to any visitors and the question that every
earthlings asks is-cannot the empire of mankind be extended
the universe over

two airplanes leaving the main group swooped down toward the cone in an evident attempt to
wreck it they crashed into that invisible barrier and ell to the sea


the invisible destroyer

little more than two years ago in the latter
part of may  to be exact a group of four
men were seated before the fireplacc of a log
cabin in the heart of the pennsylvania alle-
ghenies it was early in the evening the fire
before which they sat dissipated the darkness that strove to
mantle the room

  three of these men were scientists and together with the
fourth they were spending a week in fishing in the well-filled
trout streams of which the district boasted

the three were dr leo vachell in all
probability the greatest scientist in the
united states alexis demetriovich a
russian who although not nearly so well
known as vachell was nevertheless thought
to be one of the cleverest scientific minds
of the day and allen kieth an astrono-
mer of no mean ability  paul taylor
was the fourth member of the group the
fact that vachell and i were lifelong
friends was responsible for my presence

  there had been little conversation dur-
ing the early part of the evening vachell
and kieth were smoking meditatively i
liad jotted down some ideas for a story
that had come to my mind during the day
while demetriovich for almost an hour
had been poring over the pages of a news-
paper that had been published two days
before

  suddenly demctriovich - a
short heavy-set man with bushy
black hair thick irregular eye-
brows and a straggling beard-
looked up from his reading his
brows were contracted in a
heavy frown

  theyll never do it i he ex-
claimed theyll never do it i

  do what vachell asked

  the russian pointed to an ar-
ticle in the newspaper he held

unite the nations he replied

youve all heard of the recent
world conference held in lon-
don and their decision to unite
the nations under one govern-
ment a year after the date of the
conference their reason for
wailing a year by the way is
to allow time for dealing with
any dissension that may arise

almost every government on
earth had a representative at the
meeting and the decision to
unite was unanimous but he
concluded theyll never do it i

  why not kieth exclaimed

i can see no reason why they
wont unite nor why they
shouldnt it seems to be the
prevalent opinion that an international government will be the
solution of all our problems of state i believe that it is the
best thing that could possibly occur for the peace and pros-
perity of the world

  that would be your opinion demetriovich snorted scorn-
fully and thats how it appears on the surface but ive
been considering the problem from every angle for the last
two days and i tell you that if it is carried out this world

union will bring about the downfall of our present civilization

   as for its being the best thing for the peace of the world
he continued a little thought should convince even you that
the idea is preposterous do you imagine for a moment that
any government or any set of laws will abolish war bali
the last fight will take place between the last two individuals
left on earth you certainly dont believe even though every
nation signs the union pact that theyll all hold true to their
agreement do you all that will be needed to send two nations
at each others throats will be a little argu-
ment abou boundaries or commerce or
any number of other trivial matters no
kieth there never has been nor ever will
be a solution to the problem of war

tou arc probably correct alex
x vachell interposed but dont you
believe that an international government
will at least render wars less numerous
inasmuch as a revolting nation will be pit-
ted against every other nation on earth i
believe that a government will think twice
before opening hostilities against a neigh-
bor when all the nations are united

   i suppose that is so demetriovich as-
sented rather reluctantly but that isnt
what i had reference to when i spoke of
the downfall of civilization i was think-
ing of the effect it would have upon our
mode of living

   the political problems of to-
day are simple when compared
with the complexities that would
arise with the establishment of
an international ruling body at
present we have to contend with
the so-called grafter and his
crooked methods in politics to-
day we meet with petty vote buy-
ing with the control of execu-
tives by organizations that secure
office for the politicians with the
purchase of immunity from the
law by the dishonest rich and
similar instances of unpunished
crime what would the condi-
tions be in the case of an inter-
national government  every
country on earth with all their
graft would render the govern-
ment of the world rotten to the
core i

   demetriovich had arisen in his
excitement and had unconsciously
assumed the air of a lecturer
shaking the folded newspaper to
emphasize his words yet there
was nothing ludicrous about his
actions the deadly earnestness
of his every word and gesture
dispelled any feeling of mirth
before it was fully formed

   but more important still he continued after a moments
pause are the financial and industrial problems that would
arise even today the corporations and trusts have become a
menace to the financial peace of the world placing far too
great a degree of power in individual hands imagine what
will happen if the field of financial endeavor is widened to
encompass the entire world eventually i verily believe the
money of the world would be controlled by ten or fifteen men

i a eschbach

  tt is well knoum that the world in which 
     we live and have our being is only one
    of the possible worlds that may exist in the
    same space with us astonishing as this
    statement may sound when we examine it
    we still find it to be true

      as our author points out everything we
    see and hear and feel and detect uhth our
    other senses is perceptible to us merely be-
    cause  certain vibrations of these bodies
    and that if it were possible to change the
    rate of vibration it might be possible to de-
    tect a new world which exists simultaneously
    with ours

       if one could discover how to use this vi-
     bration what a great power he might have
     over life he could in fact become the ruler
     of our universe because as we know vibra-
     tion isthe secret of all life

       in this remarkable avihtlon story of the
     future our author treats of such a theme
     in a simple yet very dramatic manner

       incidentally we might say there is a fun-
     damental error in the science of this story
     which toe have purposely allowed in we
     would be very glad to hear from our readers
     giving us their point of view as to what this
     error is and we will publish in ottr readers

air wonder stories

  the little business man would be wiped out all industry
of every kind would be controlled by the few very rich oh
yes the government might take over all industry but would
that better conditions a government of crooked politicians
under the control of the men of money-would it be any better
or even different from the control of the dollar kings i think
not

  and think of the conditions of the poor their wages set
as low as money-glutted dictators could make them the price
of everything correspondingly high the workers continually on
the verge of starvation-how long would such conditions last
there would be one final revolt against the autocrats and the
overthrow of all organized government

  if the international government is established the time
will come when everyone will jump at the turn of a dictators
finger like so many puppets on the end of a string and well
have a world autocracy instead of a world democracy with
the final result the downfall of civilization

  but he concluded a fanatical gleam in his eyes a lot
may happen in a year i promise you theyll never do it i
he had returned to his initial statement

   heavy silence followed demetriovichs flow of oratory
  a silence that endured or more than a minute then
kieth spoke

  demetriovich  he said you should have been a lawyer
that stream of erudite nothingness would have done credit
to any barrister bnt if youll pardon my saying so you are
suffering from an attack of imaginitis there isnt an earthly
chance of your wild predictions coming true and even if there
were what could you do you-

  thats enough kieth i vachell interrupted sharply alex
has his opinions and you have yours let it go at that

  and there the matter was dropped no mention of it was
made during the rest of our week in the mountains

  but the three of us noticed a change in the russians atti-
tude although he had been a quiet individual before after
the altercation with kieth he was no more talkative than a
clam he seemed to have drawn into a shell most of the
time he kept to himself joining us only during meals any
attempts that we made toward restoring his good humor were
promptly rebuffed he seemed to have been irreconcilably
offended

  at the end of the week we started toward the nearest town
a small place named byron where we had stored our planes
there demetriovich left us flying west while kieth vachell
and i headed east kieth landed in philadelphia vachell and

i	continued on to washington our homes being in that city

  and that is how one of the most remarkable adventures in
history began three scientists and a writer a weeks vacation
in the mountains an argument about the formation of a world
government-little things yet they are the incidents that make
history

  the details of the discussion between kieth and demetriovich
are rather dry and uninteresting the arguments of such men
usually are that discussion is incorporated into this record
because of its important result

  for an entire year demetriovich was not seen all efforts
to unearth someone who saw him after he left byron were
fruitless he had disappeared as completely as though the
earth had swallowed him up

  a year-history in the making

chapter ii
a mysterious voice

during the months that followed the decision of the
nations to form an international government a remark-
able engineering feat was performed at a point mid-
way between europe and north america an artificial island

was constructed working on the floor or the ocean the engi-
neers removed the tons of soil and debris that had settled there
during the ages until they came to bed-rock there they laid
the foundation for the most wonderful structure on earth

  the island three miles long and equally wide a solid
mass of concrete and huge duralumin girders was built in the
form of a five-pointed star the indentations between the
points were intended for use as harbors oue portion of the
island was set aside as a landing field and refueling station
for the transoceanic planes and dirigibles another portion
became the site of a rather large group of houses the intended
homes of the representatives of the world there were various
other points of interest about the island that are too trivial to
mention inasmuch as they have no bearing on this record

  the really important feature of the island and the reason for
its construction was the huge edifice in its center this build-
ing almost two thousand feet high and covering a space larger
than a city block was constructed of great granite cubes and
pillars it was designed and built by the cooperating nations
of the world as the home of the new international government

  its site an artificial island in the middle of the atlantic
ocean was chosen in preference to any other suggested locality
in order to avoid showing partiality to any single country

  the island and the union hall-as the government building
was called-were completed on april   two weeks later
on april  the second world conference was called at the
capitol at washington d c

  president harwood of the united states presided after
the preliminary formalities had been dealt with they came
to the real purpose of the meeting harwood tall domineer-
ing businesslike arose and surveyed the assemblage before lie
spoke

  gentlemen he said when we the chief executives of the
world gahered for this meeting we had a definite purpose in
mind we desired to learn whether or not our decision to unite
still met with the unanimous approval that greeted it at our
first conference perhaps some of us have come to the con-
clusion during the last year that after all we should not unite
if there are those who have so decided we will hear from them
at this time

  the president remained standing his eyes resting on the
men before him an air of tense expectancy hung over the
room for almost a minute no one spoke when it was cer-
tain that no one intended speaking harwood broke the silence

  since there appears to be no objection he began then
stopped short he was interrupted in a most unexpected most
astounding manner a great roaring voice whose thunderous
volume shook the building and set the executives ears ringing
seemed to come from the ceiling

  but there is objection the voice thundered i object most
strenuously this folly must stop i warn you if this meet-
ing is not adjourned and you men are not on board trans-
oceanic liners headed for your respective countries within the
next twenty-four hours the entire world will regret it this
union will not take place there will never be ail international
government that is my warning obey-or take the conse-
quences remember twenty-four hours

the voice ceased as abruptly as it had begun a heavy
silence fell upon the assemblage men stared at their
neighbors stark amazement in their eyes what they had
heard was absolutely incredible but the ringing in their ears
testified to the truth of the impossible eyes that had been
gazing upward lowered the blank unresponsive ceiling was
all that they had seen

  for a moment president harwood was at a loss for words
his face was pale and his voice trembled when he finally spoke

  gentlemen he said we are confronted by an utterly inex-
plicable occurrence we cant explain it but we can be sure
of one tiling either this room contained someone who shouldnt
the invisible destroyer



have been here and who is opposed to our views or a huge
amplifier is concealed somewhere both thoughts arc pre-
posterous yet one or the other must be so in either case
however the best thing that we can do is to adjourn this meet-
ing until tomorrow and have the building searched immediately
obviously we cannot consider obeying the ridiculous commands
that we rcccivcd well gather here tomorrow at this time

  a moment later they filed from the room

  within two hours the entire world knew about the voice
and its threat an enterprising newspaper reporter had learned
something about the affair and president harwood when ques-
tioned had decided to tell the facts as they occurred in order
to prevent distorted and inaccurate accounts from being pub-
lished international radio news had received the facts from
the press and the entire story was given world-wide publicity
within two hours it was the chief topid of conversation all over
the world

  when the story came over the radio vachell and i were
seated in the living room of his apartments a few squares
from the capitol listening in the strange happenings in
the international assembly aroused our immediate interest
when vachell suggested that we visit president harwood with
whom he was well acquainted i readily assented

  we were about to leave when the telephone bell rang the
president wished to speak with vachell after a few moments
of conversation the latter hung up the receiver the presi-
dent wishes to see me at the white house he said and smiled
you are welcome to go along if you wish he added i was
ready to go a few moments later we started up the street
toward the executive mansion

an exhibition of power

president harwood greeted us cordially as we were
ushered into his presence after i had been introduced to
him he motioned us into chairs and without preamble began
talking about the subject that was uppermost in the mind of
each of us

  i understand he began that you are familiar in a general
way with the events that broke up the international congress
this afternoon we nodded still to be certain that you
have the facts straight it will do no harm to repeat them

  rapidly then he reviewed the events of the international
conference outlining briefly that which i have recorded in
greater detail when he had finished he continued

  using that as a basis for our consideration at what con-
clusion can we arrive with what have we to deal is it
the work of an individual a faction or a dissatisfied nation
so far as i can see we have no way of determining what is
your opinion leo he asked of the scientist

  vachell hesitated before replying

  well he said finally in my opinion its the work of an
individual or what is more likely a group theres little
chance of a nation being back of it i dont believe that any
government would risk antagonizing every other country on
earth and certainly no nation would adopt the method that
this-voice is using by the way what was your reason for
taking the action you did after you had heard the threat of
the voice

  harwood smiled quizzically frankly i dont know prompt
action was necessary and i said the first thing that came to
my mind in reality i dont believe that the warning came
from someone concealed in the room the voice had a metallic
quality indicative of an amplifier still its more probable
that a man was concealed in the room than a big loudspeaker
yet how could a man have spoken with such enormous volume
without mechanical aid and whether it was a man or
machine or both how on earth was it able to talk from the
ceiling

  that ceiling the entire room and every part of the building
itself have been carefully searched and nothing unusual has

come to light the fact of the matter is this its absolutely
inexplicable and entirely out of reason and harwood ges-
tured helplessly

  for more than an hour the president and vachell discussed
the problem while i was an interested spectator the only
actual result of the discussion was their decision to have vachell
and myself present at the conference on the following day 
suppose i was included for the sake of courtesy rather than for
any assistance i might lend but i wasnt greatly concerned
about that

  a short time later vachell and i left the white house and
headed toward our apartments

approximately twenty-four hours after leaving har-
 wood we retraced our steps to the capitol when we
were about two hundred feet away from the building a man
accosted us and asked what business we had in the neighbor-
hood vachell explained briefly and the secret service man-
for such he was-permitted us to pass

  as we were about to ascend the steps of the capitol we were
stopped again this time by an armed guard at that opportune
moment a number of closed cars drew up to the curb and the
worlds chief executives alighted as harwood greeted vachell
and me the guard withdrew and we followed the government
leaders into the building

  some time later when vachell asked harwood about the two
men who questioned us the president explained that the capitol
was completely surrounded by armed guards and secret service
men and that army planes circling overhead were intended to
prevent any possible attack from the air although there was
little likelihood of the threat of the voice being carried out
he had said they had decided to take no unnecessary chances

  a strained tension seemed to rest upon the air as harwood
called the assembly to order a feeling of expectancy tinged
with apprehension made itself known to every man in the
room

  as the meeting progressed uninterrupted the tension relaxed
to some extent and we began to feel more at ease evidently
we thought the voice would not make itself heard in this meet-
ing  the guards had kept it or him away nevertheless i began
to feel rather disappointed it seemed that i wouldnt eperience
the excitement i had expected

  we were safely past the point in the meeting where it had
been interrupted the day before no objection having been raised
and were about to adjourn when a faint purple glow crept
over the room harwood who had been speaking became
silent a deathlike stillness fell upon us

  suddenly with a roar that set our eardrums ringing a great
mirthless sardonic laugh split the silence as on the previous
afternoon the voice seemed to come from the ceiling after
a moment with disconcerting abruptness the laughter ceased
then mighty thunderous words crashed upon us

  how droll how very funny fools with the minds of chil-
dren and you imagined that mere armed guards would keep me
from this room you in your abject helplessness attempted
to control me a roaring volley of laughter rolled over us
again it ended as abruptly as before

  there was no suggestion of mirth in the giant voice when it
spoke a second time it was cold stern angry you saw fit
to defy me to disobey my commands i warned you but my
warning went unheeded youll have to take the consequences
then its tones became more lenient thoughtful

  still i may be expecting too much perhaps if you realise
the extent of the power with which you are dealing youll be
more willing to listen to reason perhaps if you understand
hmv utterly helpless you really are you will think seriously
before disobeying me again i am going to give you an exhibi-
tion of my power and then if you see fit to persist in your
foolhardy decision to unite you nuist be prepared to take the
consequences but youll never do it


air wonder stories

  as for my power you ore beginning to feel that now you
seem lo be growing heavier a great weight is pressing upon
you that weight will increase until you are powerless seem-
ingly chained to the ground this will be true of everyone
within a radius of five hundred feet of this room for an en-
tire hour youll be at my mercy defenseless as the tiniest ipfant

  bui no harm will befall you il is not my purpose to injure
you unless il is absolutely necessary the thundering words
ceased

harwood is defiant

while the voice had been speaking everyone in the room
had been motionless silent now that it had seemingly
finished i attempted to turn to vachell i could not i i was
powerless to move i the words of the voice were true a great
weight seemed to be pressing upon me crushing me against
the seat i could do naught but look directly ahead

  president harwood was still standing in the same position
he had held when the purple haze had spread across the room
that haze i noticed now seemed to be growing more intense
with every passing second harwood strove to speak then but
only a formless mumble came from his lips i tried to move
my jaws they were damped together in a viselike grip

  for an entire hour a deathlike silence and an equally death-
like absence of motion gripped us and for a similar period
of time we learned later consternation and terror clutched the
heart of every individual within a radius of five hundred feet
of the conference room althought the complete loss of con-
trol over our bodies was anything but pleasant to us who knew
its source it was absolutely terrifying to those who knew noth-
ing about it

  men walking along the street were stopped short in mid-
stride as though turned to stone the army planes circling
over head within the designated radius dropped to the earth
like plummets fortunately none of the aviators were seriously
injured machines that had been darting through the streets
had their flight arrested with a sudden snapping jolt that jarred
the bodies of the drivers painfully if it had not been for the
increased weight on the drivers themselves they would certainly
have been thrown through their windshields

  finally that interminable nerve-racking hour passed like
a suddenly released spring the invisible cords that held u
snapped the purple haze that mantled the room disappeared
then the mighty voice roared its final remark

  you have heard my warning and command fell my power
now heed

  while our minds strove to comprehend the full significance
of all that had occurred and we tried to restore blood circu-
lation and freedom of movement to our cramped muscles har-
wood spoke his voice was determined

  gentlemen he said firmly we will pay no attention to the
warning we have heajd the nations of the world cannot afford
to obey the commands of an unknown dictator regardless of
what power he may possess we will meet again in the union
hall at the time we decided upon and unite our governments

  and now gentlemen he added wearily the meeting is
adjourned

  when i joined vachell outside i noticed a particularly
thoughtful expression on his face his brows were knitted in
a thoughtful frown i was about to refer to his meditative
air when president harwood called to us from his car parked
along the curb we turned toward him and crossing the pave-
ment entered the machine

we had hardly seated ourselves when the president spoke
to vachell

  leo he asked what is your opinion of my final action in
the meeting do you think i followed the right course or-

  absolutely  you did the only thing that you could do under
the circumstances we cant submit to the dictation of one
man

  one man harwood questioned

  yes one man unless i am very badly mistaken the mys-
terious dictator is none other than alexis demetriovich he
is probably the cleverest and most resourceful scientist i have
ever met and he has a motive for doing what the voice has
done

  then he related the gist of what had accurrcd in the cabin
in the alleghenies almost a year before

  my reason for thinking it is demetriovich he concluded
is the way in which he said but youll never do ill his
first and last statement in the argument in the mountains was
almost that very exclamation and immediately after he said
that this afternoon this suspicion entered my mind the longer

i	think of it the more certain i become

  well if that is true harwood responded it simplifies
matters a great deal we need have no fear of any nation re-
volting and starting a war

   i fail to see where it simplifies anything for we are still
as helpless as we were before we havent even a vague idea
concerning the source of his power in fact we know nothing
about his activities except that which he wants us to know

  about the only thing for us to do is to continue with our
plans as though the menace of the russian didnt exist except
that we strive to defend ourselves in every way we possibly can

i	propose that you have ten or twelve of the worlds greatest
scientists present at the time when the union pact is signed so
that we may do all that we can to combat his power he is
attempting to control us through the use of science science
alone will be able to fight against him

  and in the meantime i suggest that you have the country
scoured for any information that may be secured about the
actions of demetriovich during the past year

  the president nodded thoughtfully it shall be done he
said

  for some time now the car had been parked before the
building that held the bachelor apartments in which we lived
we stepped out then and after a final word to harwood en-
tered the house the machine moved rapidly up the street

chapter iii
the russians power

the th of may  was the date set for the union
of the nations it was exactly one year after they de-
cided to unite

  vachell and i sat near the front of the small conference
room on that memorable day with the group of eleven world-
famous scientists before us on the wide platform sat the
presidents of the united states england france and germany
the worlds greatest executives behind us occupying several
rows of seats were the representatives of all nations the
room only a small chamber off the main auditorium was nearly
filled	

  because of hie threat of demetriovich tliat roomful of men
were the only beings on the island it had been decided that
to prevent any possible interference of the russian they would
be the only ones allowed to land after the signing of the
declaration of world union they intended permitting the
landing of the great host of planes of all descriptions that had
gathered around the island

   every precaution had been taken to insure the meeting against
interruption a fleet of armored vessels surrounded the great
union star and airplanes like a swarm of bees circled through
the air above the island

  still the little gathering in the union hall was rather un-
easy we somehow felt that our efforts were so futile so puny
we feared that they would prove ineffectual against the power
of the russian

and so it was we had hardly taken our places when an
interruption came the great thundering voice that we had
the invisible destroyer



learned to know-and dread-roared its message from out-
side the building and seemingly high in the air it came stern
commanding not to be disobeyed

  fools that you ore youve done it youll hove to bear the
penallyi leave that room immediately and come outside every
last one of you i

  vachell leaped to his feet and faced the gathering imme-
diately taking charge

  well gentlemen he exclaimed grimly what shall we do
shall we stay in here powerless while demetriovich does as
he pleases with us or shall we go outside as he has directed

i	think the latter course would be the most sensible to follow
inasmuch as we may be able to do something there were
completely in his power anyway it seems

  it required but a moment for us to decide to leave the room
in a few seconds we stood outside

  with one accord we turned our eyes skyward-and saw the
source of the voice i high above us hovering motionless in
mid-air sunlight glinting from its smooth unbroken sides was
a great metal cone poised high above the center of the union
building and consequently above the exact center of the island
it pointed its base directly toward the earth and from that
base streamed a pulsing flickering pillar of blue radiance
upon this the cone seemed to be resting

a moment after we had emerged from the building the
voice had spoken again

  i warned you that if my commands went unheeded youd
regret itl youve deliberately ignored everything ive said so
youll have to take the consequences i i- a shot rang out
from one of the armed vessels and the shell leaped toward its
mark and exploded about fifty feet from the cone it
seemed to have struck a wall of some invisible force

  at that moment two airplanes left the main group of ships
and swooped down toward the cone in an evident attempt to
wreck it though they sacrified their lives in the attempt like
the shell they crashed into that invisible barrier seemed to
rebound and fell into the sea twin masses of flame

  the voice laughed sardonically

  so youd try to injure me with your feeble weapois how
droll

   the cone tiled at a sharp angle and a beam of dazzling white
radiance replaced the pillar of blue it darted toward the ship
from which the shot had come and bathed it in its brilliant
light the vessel seemed to start under the impact then
slowly gradually it grew transparent wraithlike and-
vanished

  perhaps you will realise now how utterly helpless you are
but enough oj this nonsense you must reap the reward of
your folly i

  the cone again in an upright position began whirling
rapidly a circular flood of white light similar in appearance
to that which had destroyed the ship leaped from the base of
the cone and like an inverted funnel spread over the island

  a pleasant tingling pervaded my being at my first contact
with the rays but as those rays increased in intensity the
tingling lost its pleasantness and became a nerve-racking
muscle-twisting torture finally when i thought i had reached
the limit of human endurance there was a sudden-snap-as
though my spirit-had broken the cords that had bound it to its
earthly shell the white ray vanished and i was myself again

demetriovich again

i	glanced at vachell his face turned toward the ocean
had an incredulous expression upon it i followed his gaze-
and gasped in amazement the ships yachts and seaplanes that
had dotted the harbors were gone-vanished then too i
noticed that the airplanes that had been circling above us had
likewise disappeared

  we were alone on the open seal

a sharp exclamation from vachell caused me to glance up-
ward the cone was descending it came to rest about five
feet above us and a little to the left still supported by that
blue pillar then a section of the seemingly solid wall of the
cone slid aside and the figure of demetriovich appeared at the
opening he stood there for a moment looking down at us
then he stepped off into the air twin pillars of blue radiance
streamed from the soles of his shoes and he floated gently
to the ground

as demetriovich noted the expressions of amazement that
must have been on our faces he chuckled drily

youve seen some things that are rather surprising havent
you  he asked yet what youve seen is only a small fraction
of what i am capable of doing he spoke in a casual con-
versational tone that was decidedly annoying

up to this time we had been silent and motionless but now
vachell stepped forward

well alex he said boldly you seem to have become
something of  a dictator recently and your liking for the
melodramatic has been developed to a surprising degree these
childish tricks youve been performing are unworthy of a scien-
tist really im surprised at you i

a wave of red passed over the russians face and he at-
tempted to speak but vachell gave him no opportunity

all your sensationalism is of no avail now theres noth-
ing to prevent our making you a prisoner and all your threats
and promises will have been in vain in fact-

nothing to prevent you from capturing me i demetriovich
roared in anger nothing-except this he thrust his hand
into a belt that encircled his waist and drew therefrom a small
metal shining cone he pointed the base at us and pressed a
button and in a moment we were firmly rooted to the ground
we were as helpless as we had been in the capitol at wash-
ington

i think thats enough to interfere with your capturing me i
the russian exclaimed and so far as my childish tricks are
concerned i can soon convince you that what ive done is quite
a bit more than that theres no reason why i should tell you
this but at the same time it can do no harm for youre power-
less to interfere with my plans besides it may serve to con-
vince you that what im doing is for the benefit of mankind and
the world

t vibration is the secret of it all you may not realize

v	it but vibration is everything life matter energy-
all are the result of vibration some of you have heard of
the wave theory of matter that theory which advances the
thought that nothing actually has tangible substance that all
matter is caused by wave impulses and that the electrons and
protons that make up everything are merely electrical dis-
charges that theory is correct in some respects but it is
inadequate too conservative vibration is the secret of the
universe of life itself

my presence in the meetings of the world conference was
simply the result of a new form of vibratory effect the
force that paralyzed you in the second meeting and that is
gripping you now is another the protective field of force
around my cone is a third the destruction of the ship was a
fourth and the apparent disappearance of all the ships and
planes a fifth and those are but a few of the many

in al probability you vachell and your fellow scientists
arc familiar with the known facts about the table of vibration
but since ive explored the uncharted portions of the vibratory
scale things have been changed considerably

as you know vibrations of the first octave from  to 
per second make no impression upon our senses as for the
rest the qualities of the known octaves are as follows the
fourth to the fifteenth octave  to  vibrations per sec-
ond give us sound from the twenty-fifth to the thirty-fifth
 to  per second we have electricity


air wonder stories

the torty-sixth to the forty-eighth is heat light is the result
of the forty-ninth the fiftieth vibrating at the enormous
speed of  vibrations per second is chemical
rays the rays known as x-rays cover the scale from the
fifty-eighth to the sixty-first octave beyond that modern
science knows nothing you have merely scratched the surface

  ive confined my efforts to those vibrations that have been
labeled unknown from the fifteenth to the twenty-fourth
from the thirty-sixth to the forty-fifth from the fifty-first to
the fifty-seventh and from the sixty-second on up the scale-
tliat has been my field of labor ive accomplished things so
astounding and revolutionary tliat it would be a waste of breath
to try to explain to you who know so little

  gravity loses its power before my rays i can either increase
or nullify its force ive mastered light-i can vanish at will
that thunderous voice in the capitol and above the island a
short time ago-merely the result of my control over vibration
i could enumerate one thing after another that i can accom-
plish with vibration but i could gain nothing by so doing

  in a short time im going back and take charge of things
and with the help of vibrations make a new and better world
the russian paused a moment his forehead creased by a
thoughtful frown then he spoke again

  i suppose youre wondering what i meant when i said i
was going back ill tell you

lost

 what im going to say by the way involves a differ-
ent phase of vibration from that of which ive spoken
to begin-you know that all elements can exist in three forms
solid liquid and gaseous for example-icc water and steam
or consider metals normally they are solid-heat them and
they melt and become liquid-increase the heat and they go off
in a vapor or gas like steam

  what is the cause of this  heat of course and heat is-
vibration  the heat starts the electrons in the metal whirling
at such a furious pace that they become separated to such an
extent that they form a liquid at a higher rate of vibration
the electrons separate still farther and the liquid becomes a gas

  now consider the whirling of an airplane propeller its
blades turn so rapidly that they make no impression on the retina
of the eye visually at least they arent there of course
any attempt to place anything in the space the blades occupy
would be a failure but suppose that like the action of heat
on metal something would cause the electrons of the propeller
to vibrate at increased speed while it was spinning without
changing its form wouldnt it to all intents and purposes
become nonexistent yet it would still be there

  under the latter condition wouldnt it be possible to place
something in the path of the propeller perhaps even walk
through it unscathed

  at any rate this is what im trying to impress upon you
it is possible by accelerated vibration to throw something into
an entirely new dimension therefore another world exists
simultaneously with ours

  countless worlds in fact are occupying the same space as
countless other worlds each world vibrating in an octave
peculiar to itself exists in space in which there are other
worlds of other vibratory periods and of entirely different
natures

  not only did i learn that this was a fact but with the
aid of that cone which i built during the last five years ive
traveled from one vibratory world to another

  when  say im going back i mean im reluming lo the
world with which you are familiar at the time when my rays
covered the island and you thought the ships and planes had
vanished it was the island itself that actually disappeared car-
ried into the world of another vibration and here you will
remain while i remake the world of our plane

it may interest you to know that this world is barren and

utterly devoid of life because of that i hope you have enough
food to last a long long time for it may be years before i per-
mit your return if i ever do

  but ive wasted enough time i dont see why i went to the
trouble of explaining anyway i suppose it was my pride in
what i had accomplished

  and now i am going it will be a long time before you see
me again i shall be very busy

  still keeping that paralyzing little cone trained upon us
demetriovich in some way started the action of the blue force-
rays and rose into the air before entering the cone he re-
leased us then the door slid into place behind him

  a faint almost inaudible hum made itself heard it was a
soft soothing hum tliat grew louder with the passing moments
slowly the cone lost its sharpness of outline grew less distinct
a great mocking laugh came from the disappearing cone it
hovered there a moment-then was gone

  if what the russian had said was true we were marooned in
a barren alien world with practically no chance to escape
and our own world was left without rulers at the mercy of
demetriovich and his vibrations

chapter iv
at the russians mercy

demetriovichs explanation of his means of accom-
plishing what he had and the realization of the import
of our present position momentarily dazed us his
revelations were so stupendous so incredible that they stunned
the reason

  vachell was the first to recover facing the group of scien-
tists and world executives a thoughtful serious expression on
his fae he said solemnly

  gentlemen our world is face to face with a crisis that may
mean the destruction of civilization i know demetriovich bet-
ter probably than any other living individual and i believe
that all he said is true i he is not given to vain boasting and
besides the things that have just taken place arc such over-
whelming proofs that there is no room for doubt

  this problem the greatest in the history of tile world in-
volving as it does every man woman and child on the globe
can only be solved by dear cold reasoning indeed we may
never be able to solve it and so may never get back

  if we fail gentlemen may god have pity on mankind
and with head bent in thought vachell led the way into the
union hall

  when we had resumed the positions we had had in the con-
ference room before the russians interruption except that
the place of the four presidents was now occupied by vachell
the latter continued his remarks

  do you realize what our disappearance must mean to the
world briefly it means this the nations have lost their
rulers and the greatest scientists of earth the only ones at all
capable of fighting against demetriovich gentlemen the world
is at the mercy of the russian i

  there is however a remote possibility that we are still
back where we belong that the ships and planes were in some
way destroyed and that our position isnt as hopeless as it
seems understand the possibility is very remote but it is
worth considering so i suggest that we first of all learn
whether or not were still where we should be

  president harwood arose thats an excellent suggestion
he smiled but i cant sec how it can be followed out it seems
to me that were very thoroughly imprisoned on this island

  we have the means of escape at our disposal vachell re-
turned if it was demctriovichs intention to keep us here he
has slipped up for theres a three-passenger plane in one of
the hangars i happen to know its there because taylor and
i visited the island with it two days ago and left it here re-
turning to the united states on one of the transoceanic liners
the invisible destroyer



  i propose that you harwood and taylor and i take the
plane and fly to the north american continent even though
we are in a different vibratory world the general geographical
conditions will be the same if as demetriovich said he has
taken us to a lifeless world we had better find out at once
and if were still on our own plane we had better get help
immediately in any case the first thing to do is to learn the
cxact condition of things

after a rather lengthy discussion the officials and scien-
 tists agreed to vachell plan and we proceeded toward
the airplane hangars i was included as one of the three be-
cause i was an expert pilot having served three years in the
international air patrol

  the plane a small wenger-helicoptcr type a very late model
with four motors we filled with gas and loaded with provisions
and water after seeing that everything was in perfect con-
dition we rolled it out of the hangar

  finally all was ready and harwood vachell and i stepped
into the machine the motors were started and the helicopter
propellers lifted the plane high into the air straightening out
we started across the ocean with constantly accelerating speed
in a few moments the union island had dwindled to a minute
star then it was gone

  only one thing worthy of note occurred during the five un-
eventful hours of the trip across the ocean about midway
between the island and our destination we saw what seemed
to be a flashing silver meteor darting across the sky it was
moving in the same direction that we were or we would not
have seen it as it was it soon outdistanced us and was lost
to our sight

  of one thing we felt sure that flashing object whatever it
might be was not of our world our hearts sank

  finally we arrived at our destination i had pointed the
nose of the plane toward what under normal conditions would
have been new york gty but these were anything but nor-
mal conditions for instead of the familiar skyline of sky-
scrapers we saw a vast expanse of white translucent glass as
far as the eye could reach south west and north that monoto-
nous level sheet of glass continued

  our own world obviously it wasnt but as vachell
pointed out neither was it a desert world

  perhaps demetriovich made a mistake the scientist sug-
gested and took us too far along the vibratory scale or not
far enough to answer his purpose if as he said there are
countless worlds existing on the surface of the earth that
could easily be possible

  that in all probability is what occurred the russian had
made a mistake

  hour after hour we continued flying searching for an open-
ing in the continents roof that there was such an opening
we were certain for we reasoned the projectile we had seen
flying in this direction must have gone through the glass some-
where it certainly hadnt remained on the surface

  at last we saw that for which we were searching some dis-
tance ahead over what must have corresponded with our mis-
sissippi valley there was a great circular well-like opening
in the glass fully a mile in diameter

a new world

in a moment the plane had flashed over the glass to the open-
ing my haste almost proved to be our undoing as we
flew out over the opening a great gleaming projectile scream-
ing shrilly so great was its velocity flashed almost straight up
into the air

  the plane took a terrifying dip turning end over end caught
in a whirling vortex of air that resulted from the projectiles
flight we pitched and spun like a leaf in a gale that we were
not cast to the bottom of the shaft a broken wreck is no credit
to me for i had completely lost control of the machine how-

ever we escaped

  we were close to the bottom of the shaft when i righted the
plane a moment later i brought it to earth with hearts beat-
ing more rapidly we left the machine and stared around what
manner of creatures or things might we see

  not for long did we wonder an oval doorway in the nearby
glass wall of the shaft slid back and a strange little creature
appeared in a general way he looked like a man but such
a man i he was only about four feet tall and painfully thin
and that apparently emaciated undernourished body supported
a huge hairless head that was more than twice the size of mine
the features of his face were even regular built on the same
scale as his head but any niccness that his face might have had
was destroyed by his lack of teeth apparently he hadnt a
tooth in his mouth his lips were drawn in over his gums like
those of a toothless hag when we first saw him he had an
expression of consternation and unbelief on his face

  well old top vachell exclaimed facetiously this is an
unexpected pleasure we are very glad to see you we hope
you feel the same toward us

  and the little man replied although no words passed his
lips we received the distinct impression that he had given a
mental answer somewhat harshly it seemed he had asked
us what we wanted and from whence we had come

  ignoring the means of communication this big-headed being
had employed vachell explained you see its this way
he said weve been brought to this world against our wills
and we wish to return to our own vibratory plane it is our
hope that your world can aid us

  i thought vachell had taken leave of his senses when i heard
his explanation what would this creature know about vibra-
tory worlds i but strangely the big-head seemed to under-
stand he nodded then the silent communication came
follow me i

  bending low in order to escape contact with the top of the
little opening we followed the strange being into his glass-
roofed world

when i try to describe the wonders of that astounding
land i realize the utter futility of words or perhaps
the stupendous things we saw were beyond my powers of com-
prehension be that as it may according to all appearances
we had come into a world that was fully fifteen thousand years
ahead of our own in progress indeed by comparison with the
beings of that world we were about as low on the scale of
evolution as the pygmies of australia are when compared
with us

  glass white translucent glass was everywhere we learned
later that the entire north american continent was one huge
glass house and that all people lived and all industry took
place under one roof there were no streets as we know them
great lifts and overland cars propelled by a type of vibratory
force connected all parts of the land and everywhere were
those disproportionate figures scurrying here and there like so
many busy little ants

  we followed our host or captor whichever he was through
the throng of big-hcads that had gathered around us into one
of the numerous lifts with breath-taking speed we were borne
upward when the elevator came to a halt we left it and
moved along a glass hall past rows of oval doorways they
were exactly alike with nothing to identify them so far as i
could see

  the little big-head seemed to know his destination though
for he paused before one of the ovals and pressing a little but-
ton led us through the doorway into the room

  this seemed to be some sort of work-room for it was filled
with intricate machinery and to us utterly meaningless de-
vices what the purpose of it all was we never learned every-
thing by the way was constructed of the same white glass

  our guide stopped to confer with one of the workers for a


air wonder stories

moment-at least i suppose inaudible communication passed
between them-tlien lie continued on across the room at the
far side we passed through another oval and stood within the
room that was our destination

  this room was entirely different from any we saw during
our stay in that vibratory world its walls were a dull opaqu
black yet paradoxically from them seemed to come a strange
opalescent radiance the room was bare devoid of any furni-
ture except for a small platform in the center upon which stood
two small short-legged stools between the stools was a most
intricate and complex device from which wires led to one of
the walls

a strange experience

as the big-head commanded vachell to be seated on one
of the stools the latter eyed the strange device between
them rather dubiously whatll it do-whatever your name
is he asked hesitantly

  it is a device for visual thought transference came the
mental reply which all of us caught it will do you no liarm
i have no name i am known by my number lxa-
 and again came the command for vachell to sit on the
stool

  after the scientist had mounted the platform and seated him-
self l-as we thought of the big-head after that-placed
a strange glass hood over vachells head and eyes and a similar
device on his own huge cranium and settled back on his stool

  i shall never know except in a general way what thoughts
passed between those two minds vachell some time later out-
lined briefly what had been asked of him and the answers he
had given it is from that outline that i have my information

  when the two were seated vachell was directed to form a
mental picture of all that had happened in connection with our
coming to that world he began at the beginning with the
week the four of us had spent in the hills and step by step
went through the entire story up to our arrival in the glass
city when he had finished he pictured the world in a state
of chaos and devastation as the result of demctriovichs assump-
tion of authority and his subsequent mismanagement of the
nations and finally he made a plea for aid in returning to
our vibratory plane and fighting against the russian

  vachell after a few moments of waiting received a thought
picture of himself making his plea before a strange monstrous
creature who seemed to be nothing but head so far as vachell
could see the creature consisted of a great fleshy spheroidal
mass covered by a dead-white membrane unbroken save for
two huge lidless eyes near the top and a small red orifice
at its base the thought was repeated then l raised his
metal cap and bade vachell do likewise

  at the big-heads direction then the three of us seated our-
selves on the platform that he and vachell had just quitted
facing the wall that was connected with the thought-transfer-
ence device suddenly the room was plunged into darkness the
walls no longer emitting their opalescent light

  as we sat there watching waiting we heard-no rather
sensed a vast roaring rushing sound a somehow orderly
chaos as though all vibrations of every octave were loosed at
once-concentrated-hurling themselves through our minds
then from the black wall before us streamed a brilliant radi-
ance flecked with minute darting lights in some unnatural
way it seemed to pass through us as light-streams through a
window pane-as though we were transparent

then slowly but with ever increasing rapidity we began
to move forward the wall opened up before us into a
light-flooded unthinkably vast tunnel along this tunnel we
moved swept on by that cosmic hurricane of sound

  but were we moving  i cannot say paradoxically i seemed
to be seated on that platform in the room-and yet seemed to
be moving miles and miles out through that tunnel of sound

that tumult of vibration i hesitate to record this but-
gained the distinct impression that i was at one and the same
time seated in the room and yet was-stretchcd-through the
miles of the tunnels space

  gradually the tempestuous roaring lost some of its force
slowly it abated and-died and our own movement through
the tunnel ceased then as never before i was conscious of
that utter annihilation of distance that inexplicable projection
of myself across the miles

  the tunnel had ended in a great dome-ceilingcd chamber
in the center of the chamber floating stationary in midair was
a cloud of mist as we entered the room the mist swirling
and twisting drew aside revealing the white-skinned bodylcss
brain-being

  as we stared at the amazing spectacle in awe we somehow
felt that we were in the presence of infinite wisdom of un-
paralleled knowledge

  god exclaimed harwoodin a hushed whisper for the first
time breaking the silence can all this be- the whisper
died on his lips as the mist that had surrounded the brain-being
drifted down and encircled us it seemed to gather around
and congeal upon vachell arose then with the scientist in
its grasp and swept up toward the entity from which it liad
come bore him or the strange projection of him-for he was
still beside me in the black room-entirely enveloped by itself
up up until he was face to face with the super-intelligence of
that vibratory world

  as vachell described it later he experienced a singular
draining sensation as though all knowledge all power of
thought was being drawn from him this endured for a mo-
ment then vachell was replaced at our side

back to their world

we returned to the room by tbe same path over which
we had come we seemed to remain stationary shrink-
ing while the tunnel whirled past us and finally that unnatural
extension of each of us was no more and we were back in
the lightless room facing the blank black wall

  i cleared my throat to speak heard harwood stirring rest-
lessly vachell laid silencing liands on our shoulders

  not yet taylor harwood he murmured more to fol-
low

  tensely we waited scarcely breathing then a dim lumi-
nous haze appeared where the tunnel had been that haze
grew-resolved itself into an image of the brain-being the
picture dimmed for a moment vague formless then in its
place we saw-ourselves each surrounded by a colorless cloud
of misty light behind us less distinctly outlined were those
who had remained on the island similarly surrouned by nebu-
lous clouds of radiance in the hand of each of us was
clutched a long slender metal rod with a white glass ball at
one end

  then we saw demctriovichs cone sweeping down a white
vibratory ray darting toward us the ray striking the clouds
that surrounded us was either deflected or nullified for it
accomplished nothing and then from the balls on our slender
rods flashed beams of almost invisible force they came in
contact with the one and burned through and through it it
crashed to the earth riddled with holes a useless wreck with
that the image vanished and in a moment the room was again
flooded with light

  l gave mental expression to his approval as he led us
from the room when we were alone in the quarters that the
big-head assigned to us we likewise gave expression to our
satisfaction and joy but in a far more demonstrative manner
the russian and his works would be destroyed and the world
would be saved not once did it occur to us to doubt the
ability of these creatures to do what they promised

  harwood had taken little part in our rejoicing when
vachell questioned him about this he replied
the invisible destroyer



   im in a sort of daze thats all the utterly astounding
things that have occurred since weve come here have thrown
me a little off balance he smiled ruefully

   harwood vachell counseled earnestly dont let these
things affect you i know even better than you how incredible
they are they contradict all known laws of science i cannot
explain what occurred so i do not try and ive seen things
that neither of you are aware of

i shall record little of what took place during the three
weeks that followed while for some unaccountable reason
we heard no more about our return to our own world l
who by the way was one of the most important individuals
in their world conducted us by means of the tunnel of sound
to some of the most interesting spots on the continent those
trips and the countless mechanical and architectural marvels
we saw have been recorded in detail in the joint work of
vachell harwood and myself the world of another octave

   at last those three weeks of impatient waiting passed and
one morning shortly after we had arisen l came to us with
the news that we were to return to the island that day

   impatiently we followed him through a labyrinth of passages
and lifts to the well-like opening in the glass roof as we
passed through the oval door into the open air we saw a long
comparatively slender cylinder constructed of the same white
material as everything else in that strange land a series of
oval doors ran along one side of the machine l led us
through one of these

   i make no attempt to give more than a general description
of the wonders we saw in that white projectile their amaz-
ingly complex nature gave them an air of unreality tower-
ing masses of whirling machinery-great spinning fly-wheels-
devices whose strangeness beggars description-the vehicle was
filled with these

   in the center of the floor of the projectile running its entire
 length was a yard-wide strip of pale blue glass l bade us
 stand on this mentally explaining that it was the machines
 center of gravity keeping us fast to the floor regardless of
 what position the projectile assumed

   when we had followed his directions and were standing on
the strip of blue which held our feet in a vise-like grip there
was a sudden lurch a breath-taking burst of speed and the
projectile settled down to an even forward motion

   our flight by plane from the island to the opening in the
glass had taken eight hours the return in the projectile was
accomplished in little more than one we did not know our
journey had ended until l opened one of the doors and indi-
cated that we should step out for we had no way of determining
how fast we had been traveling

   just before we left the vehicle two big-heads came forward
with the metal rods that would be our weapons and the glass
bands that were to form our ray-repelling auras after we
had divided them among ourselves vachell addressed l

   is the cylinder going back with us he asked

   no came the silent reply our bodies are too frail to
bear the strain of the journey all of us who have attempted
it have failed to return and now if youll leave-

   a moment later we stood outside the projectile the door
was closed and the great white cylinder rose into the air
standing among the world executives and scientists who had
gathered around us with words of greeting and inquiry on their
lips we followed the projectiles flight with our eyes

   it shot straight up into the air for about four thousand feet
 then stopped short and hung stationary its end pointing toward
 the island a moment later a blinding beam of radiance
 streamed from that end and spread over the union star for
 i second time we felt that torturing tingling more and more
 unbearable became the vibration of the atoms of our beings-
 then there was a sharp snap-and the projectile had vanished

   we had returned safely to our own world i

chapter v
a strategic plan

 for almost an hour after our return vachell talked re-
 lating all that had transpired since the time we left the
 island

 and finally gentlemen he concluded those men of that
 other world using a method somewhat similar to that of
 demetriovich sent us back to our own plane

 the scientist was silent for a moment then holding one of
 the glass bands and slender metal rods in his hands he spoke
 again

 now gentlemen before we do anything else i think we had
 better prepare for our defence each of us will place one of
 these bands around his waist and arm himself with these little
 rods for we dont know when well need their protection

 harwood and i distributed the bands and rods while vachell
 demonstrated how they were to be used then while the rest
 were engaged in placing their bands in position i inspected
 mine with greater care than i had been able to exercise before

 the band i saw was a simple affair slightly oval in shape
 and just large enough to fit snuggly around the average waist
 about four inches high it was and about half that in thick-
 ness it reminded me of a great glass wedding ring with
 its surface smooth and unbroken save for a knob on one side
 when this knob was turned the band began its work surround-
 ing its wearer with a protective aura

 a few minutes after the bands had been distributed we pre-
 sented a strange appearance each of us was standing in the
 heart of a wraithlike transparent cloud that extended about six
 inches from all sides of our bodies we seemed to be radiant
 glowing

 one of the executives raised the question as to what was to
 be done next in a moment the members of the group were
 busily discussing what would be the best plan to follow some
 suggested that we wait for the russian to make the initial
 move others were in favor of sending out a plea for help over
 the radio transmitter that was on the island

 we had debated this question for some minutes without re-
 sult when a sudden exclamation from one of the scientists
 caused us to look around we followed his pointing finger
 with our eyes

 high in the eastern sky we saw a tiny black speck rapidly
 growing larger as we watched it resolved itself into a small
 one-man helicopter it was over us was going past-then it
 seemed to hesitate and in a long slanting drop flashed down
 toward the island

 it landed on the opposite side of the union hall with
 one accord we raced around the huge structure we turned
 a corner and came face to face with-kieth i allen kieth
 the astronomer who had been the fourth member of our party
 in the alleghenies

 he greeted us with an expansive smile and an outstretched
 hand such relief i had never seen written in a mans
 countenance

 gad but im glad to see you he exclaimed you cant
 realize how much the nations have missed you the russian
 told the world that you had all been annihilated utterly wiped
 out and we did see you disappear-but youre here again
 but-but-you look strange-as though- his voice trailed off
 into silerice and he stepped back and stared at us wonderingly

 its a long story kieth vachell told him too long in
 fact to relate in detail now we did disappear and so far
 as this world is concerned we were annihilated blotted put
 ill tell you in a general way what occurred without trying to
 explain its causes youll have to accept my story

by the way you neednt stare at us like tliat were not
ghosts this aura that surrounds us is there for a purpose

f man could learn to control the laws of gravity

would find himself on the threshold of the last
frontier-space i

dr mars jorgstedt noted astronomer finished
and as he sat back in his big roomy chair in the lounge of the
scientists club he gazed at his friend defiantly his feelings
concerning such a possible achievement must have been really
deep for his gray eyes glittered with a peculiar light

to professor markleson head of the american institute of
physics sitting opposite dr jorstedts eyes seemed like smolder
ing cauldrons in which intense fires burned

for a long time professor markleson studied the deep-set
features of his friend pondering over the words just uttered
not for two years had these two old friends come together for
dr jorgstedt had secluded himself with
the huge telescopes of his observatory lo-
cated at the mouth of the grand canyon

now they were together again and the
famous physicist noted the appearance of
many new lines prominently stamped upon
the features of his friend markleson
leaned forward apparently to guard some-
thing he had to say from unwanted ears

suppose my dear doctor he said
casually that such an achievement has
been realized

dr jorgstedt regarded him quizzically
as though trying the impossible-to read
what lay behind the smiling dancing brown
eyes of the man before him he shrugged
his shoulders

it would create a world-wide sensation
professor i he said moving a hand from
his chin to toy with a delicate watch-chain

professor markleson glanced around
him and then appeared to edge
close to his friend

and if i of all men should
have learned that secret what
would you say doctor

the noted astronomer gave
him a startled look his lips
twitching oddly as he pondered
the strange cryptic words they
impinged upon his senses over
and over again like the clanging
of a great tower clock tolling off
the hours

then my friend he replied
admiringly you would be even
a greater genius than you have
already proved yourself to be i
have you been holding something back from the world profes-
sor

professor markleson settled back in his chair and smiled a
red flush mounting above his spotless collar and spreading be-
hind his ears he nodded

i hold the secret of gravitational repulsion doctor he said
softly vaguely aware of the flush that had mounted his face
at the compliment his friend had handed him the problem of
nullification has been mastered although i have kept the news
strictly to myself until now i

dr jorgstedt sat for a long time staring at the physicist the
revelation had dumbfounded him had such a statement come
from the lips of anyone but professor markleson he would
have quit his presence at once without further ado and since

his friend had informally announced the results of his research
in the field of gravitational nullification it awed him a little

  under those circumstanccs professor he said how do
you propose to utilize your wonderful discovery

  professor markleson leaned forward again

  not how i am going to utilize it doctor his reply came
clear and convincing but how i have already embodied the
principles in the greatest airship ever built i

had doctor jorgstedt been subjected to a charge of high
potential electricity he could not have been more startled
than he was now at the rapid-fire occurrence of important
achievements in the life of his old friend during the past two
years then his brows clouded in disappointment for he re-
called professor marklesons old vow that if he should ever
solve the mystery of gravitation the first
thing he would do would be to construct
an interplanetary ship to carry both of
them to distant planets for explorations

  then you have altered your plans to
  build a space flyer professor he asked
  seeing his hopes of visiting mars and other
  worlds of the solar system go waning tem-
  porarily it least

  i have for the present doctor the
physicist replied nodding but not my
vowsto make it possible someday for you
to place a foot on the worlds of your tele-
scopes i have built an airship embodying
the principles of gravitational repulsion to
illustrate the possibilities of craft capable
of rising from the earths surface without
expensive propulsion in my opinion man
needs cheaper and more rapid transporta-
tion more than he needs knowledge of the
universe at this time when the old type of
aircraft are becoming too slow
for his increasing demands for
speed with the maximum of
safety we shall therefore have
to forego our personal hopes to
navigate infinite space until our
fellow beings have first been
given the benefits of my dis-
coveries in a way that will do
them the most good in the mean-
while mars venus uranus and
the others will not disappear
doctor jorgstedt laughed a
tense deep-throated laugh that
caused the eminent physicist to
stare at him curiously

  i guess you are right my
friend he said but i confess im a trifle disappointed for
an instant my imagination pictured us as the first human beings
ever to set foot upon the soil of a distant world however let
me be the first to congratulate you upon your dtscovcry then
if you dont object you might enlighten me with some of the
high lights concerning the manner or methods with which you
achieved such an important step your propulsion principles of
course must depart from the present principles of the air-
screw

  professor markleson nodded and settled back in his chair
resting his elbows upon the arms and pyramiding his fingers
tip to tip

  after it was done doctor he said simply i was aston-
ished at the simplicity of the whole thing i merely grasped a

air wonder stories

few old time principles made a few changes and amalgamated
them together with an idea or two of my own the result was
that i discovered an alloy of metals comprising besides the
three well-known elements iron nickle and cobalt the new
metal hydroleum which when subjected to certain treatments
applied by electrical energy becomes highly magnetized per-
sonally i had not given much credence to einsteins theories of
relativity so you can imagine the shock  received when  found
that this alloy under the influence of magnetism when placed in
the air over my work bench remained suspended this proved
beyond a doubt that gravity and magnetism when successfully
applied are precisely the same thing as expounded by einstein

  i have heard much talk about relating the two jorgstedt
said smilingly just what do you mean in your case have
you discovered perpetual motion 

  i can understand your doubts markleson nodded  have
not discovered perpetual motion what  have discovered is
that it is possible to put into my metal electrical energy that will
give it the power to oppose or nullify the force of gravitation
that simply means that instead of carrying great quantities of
explosive energy as rockets do in order to get away from the
earth i fill my metal with electro-magnetic energy which in-
creases the weight of the plates but little

  i understand jorgstedt nodded please go on

  i set to work immediately markleson continued to build
a model airship with a hull composed of the alloyed metals to
this i attached a thousand feet of wire i then electro-mag-
netized the miniature ship and it rose at a tremendous speed to
the full length of the line which snapped releasing the model
from the leash i it vanished at once into space like a stone
falling off a cliff but i discovered that in rising the model
wabbled gyrated and corkscrewed upward like a drunken thing
then i constructed another model in which i allowed only the
central section to accept the magnetic influence by insulating the
nose and the tail against it this one went up on even keel
without a single gyration i found that by using an added cur-
rent control i could raise it and bring it down at will

  needless for me to say work was begun at once on the con-
struction of a full-sized airship during the first stages of the
work i arrived at the conclusion that the present day air-screw
would not be powerful enough to propel such a hulk through
the air at the rate of speed i desired it to attain from then
on i grasped at professor goddards rocket drive scheme and
developed it quite to my liking by making several radical
changes in fuel and the driving exhaust systems

  as a result i have created a ship whose capabilities and
possibilities are far beyond the conception of ordinary man-one
whose speed is unlimited and whose power to rise to the higher
altitudes will be unchecked even by the tremendous attraction of
the earths gravitational forces even now the craft is ready
for her maiden flight into realms of speed and space never be-
fore attained by man-made machinery i

professor markleson abstractedly pulled a pipe
from his pockets and proceeded to fill it dr jorgstedt sat
like an image in stone and continued to stare at him until the
aromatic fragrance of the others curling smoke caused him to
light a pleasant cigar for a few silent minutes he seemed to
resign his thoughts to the satisfying odors that emanated from
it he puffed upon it rapidly at first then settled down osten-
sibly for a peaceful smoke although his mind was far from it
fls professor markleson could easily see then jorgstedt
turned again to the physicist

  my friend he said regarding him speculatively if your
discoveries are what you say they are then i bow my head to
you-the master of the universe

  professor marklesons rather heavily built frame shook with
almost silent laughter that was mixed not only with the satis-
faction of having his friend compliment him but with perfect

confidence in what he had achieved it was a peculiar char-
acteristic of him to laugh thus when he had solved some tre-
mendous problem as dr jorgstedt had long since learned to
know

  a thousand thanks for the title doctor i said markleson his
eyes twinkling but i think you had better save it until i have
actually conquered the universe thats a lot of territory for
one man to be master over 

  the astronomer nodded and grinned behind the pale blue
haze

chapter ii

tbe sky urchin

for nearly two years the sky urchin had been under con-
struction under the watchful eyes of professor markleson
and during all that time he had kept it a perfect secret
from the world with the exception of a score of under-scien-
tists from the american institute of physics whose hands had
built it dr jorgstedt and two high government officials not a
soul had been given an inkling as to what was taking place
behind the walls of a hangar oil the scientists residential
grounds

  now the moment had arrived for the greatest airship in the
world to take off on its maiden flight with a passenger list made
up of a few privileged scientists government authorities and a
number of the worlds foremost newspaper editors throngs of
reporters circulated around it on the ground snapping pictures
right and left but none were permitted to enter armed guards
furnished by the government stood ready to halt any person who
could not display a pass signed personally by professor markle-
son even government officials were no exception to the rule
established by the scientist as a precautionary measure when
lie issued the invitations for the maiden flight he was taking
no chances on having some over-eager reporter or photographer
snap a flash-gun with in the sky urchins huge cigar-shaped
hulk probably wrecking it as a result the fuel for the exhaust
drive systems was highly explosive though stored in such a
way that it was safe from ordinary exposure yet one never
could tell just what an ambitious newspaperman might do to
obtain an interesting picture

  the sky urchin stretched across the private landing like a
great silver cigar with two transparent bands one on each end
midway from the center these insulated the craft so that its
magnetic influence would concentrate in the center between
them thus establishing perfect stabilization looking through
the bands one could see the interior of the crafts control room
bridge and foreward observation decks at the rear end under
the band was a comfortable lounging cabin of three transparent
decks lavishly appointed with large easy chairs a row of
round porthole-like windows lined cither side of the huge
polished metal hulk at her tail giant stabilizing fins arose
like the blades of some tremendous windmill two sets of
laterals and ailerons of shining metal protruded from the ships
rear giving one the impression of looking at some great
stream-lined creature of the ocean depths with double tail-fins

  it was a thing of flashing beauty although without the cus-
tomary gondolas and gas bags so common in ordinary airships
it seemed bound eternally to earth but had the observer stopped
to consider the intricate lifting apparatus enclosed within it he
would have conceded at once that the sky urchin was indeed a
craft to be marveled at and had the comparatively small
driving exhausts located between every two of the rolling sta-
bilizers been studied by one skilled in rocket propulsion the
huge ships powers of speed would have immediately become
comprehensible

professor marklesons craft marked the greatest
step yet attained by physical aviation science it surpassed
the sky ruler



any other craft plane or ship in the world and at once ap-
peared to establish the united states as foremost in the field
of aviation

  now with the sun at its zenith sending down warm brilliant
rays the sky urchin was ready to take the air the passengers
had gone within to sit in the control room to watch professor
marklcson and his crew of five choice men take the ship upward
strange to say dr jorgstedt was not among them and the
scientist at first had displayed disappointment at the failure of
his friend to appear in time for this epoch-making event then
lie concluded that some unforsecn obstacle had arisen to prevent
the famous astronomer from appearing on the scene he finally
dismissed his disappoinment with a shrug and centered his at-
tention upon preparations for the take-off

  there came an ominous hush over the huge ship as professor
markleson took up a position at the controls outside camera-
men were grinding out reel after reel press camera-men raced
hither and yon to gain advantageous points to shoot the glis-
tening air cruiser from every conceivable angle it was the
scientists intention eventually to permit the world to know also
what the interior of his ship looked like but not quite yet-not
until after the maiden flight had taken place and all the details
had been safely placed in the archives of the united states
patent offices then the camera-men would be allowed to go
through the sky urchin-perhaps i

  professor markleson peered at the dials in front of him and
glanced through the transparent band from his position on the
control bridge high up toward the forward curving that brought
the ships nose to a pike-like point the scientist could see
scurrying figures darting here and there along the ground he
pulled  a cord and a high-sounding siren shrieked for field
clearance at once he noticed the armed guards running away
from the ships polished sides to take up positions with the
camera-men near the walls of the hangar

  the passengers seated upon comfortable stationary benches
well away from the controls seemed numbed into quietness
they watched each single movement of the scientist as his
hands touched the various controls they watched him pulling
gradually upon a throttle scarcely larger than the grip of a
mans hand then they became aware of an increasing drone
surging through the ships hull the edges of the central sec-
tion of the hulk along the transparent band seem to glow with
a purple luminosity the guest scientists watched it with puz-
zled interest and the various newspaper editors began jotting
notes upon whatever papers they could find in their pockets
contrary to popular conception newspapermen do not carry
notebooks ready for instant use but rely on memory which under
ordinary conditions serves the purpose adequately

  there were a score of stunned pcsonalities on board the sky
urchin when it was discovered that the craft had already left
the earth i professor markleson grinned with amusement at the
sudden astonishment on the faces of his guests he glanced
around at them his eyes aglow with excitement thus far the
sky urchin was a success

strange forebodings

with scarcely a tremor it had risen from its resting
place on the surface markleson had merely manipulated
certain instruments and the great craft had responded to the
touch of his capable hands now it floated two miles above
the field its nose pointed westward as steady and rigid as if it
lay at rest within its hangar superb a thing of glistening
beauty the monster hovered in the sky

  take a look gentlemen professor markleson invited
the field below appears no larger than a square emerald set-
ting in a mans ring i rather a pleasant take-off eh

  blue sky stretched beyond below lay the earth criss-crossed
with ribbon-like thoroughfares squared with checkerboard
patches of green and brown interspersed here and there with

conical spires that seemed like infinitesimal needle points in
comparison with the vastncss of the visible terrain the pas-
sengers peered in all directions plainly hypnotized by the sudden
unexpected rise and the glory of the scenes on all sides the
realization that here at last was a revolutionary step in aerial
transportation stunned even professor markleson himself and
it was with keen delight that he listened to the praise that was
at once heaped upon him by those who appreciated his as-
tounding achievements

  he turned presently to the controls and ordered his picked
crew to various stations within the cabin the sky urchin
seemed to heel earthward as the propulsion units went into ac-
tion yellow jets of flame spitting rearward from the exhausts
between the stabilizers at the tail the exhausts began a gradual
roar that soon gave way to a pleasant lulling hiss

  as the crafts nose dipped earthward under the recoil of the
driving exhausts professor markleson swung the aileron con-
trols slightly upward by turning a small wheel within a larger
one instantly the sky urchins nose lifted skyward the
passengers suddenly tensed by the unexpected plunge breathed
in relief

  i dont believe the recoil can be overcome gentlemen the
scientist said theres bound to be some reaction upon the
ship when the propulsion exhausts arc thrown open i found it
difficult to change the recoil to a slight downward plunge rather
than the straight ahead jerk that would ordinarily happen yet
it was more gentle than i had anticipated i

  the great scientists strode over close to the transparent band
and looked out far below the terrain was slipping past in a
brown blur scarcely an object was recognizable at the terrific
velocity under which the sky urchin was speeding through the
air before the constant explosions from its propulsion exhausts
the passengers stared at one another their eyes twinkling with
satisfied lights at last science had conquered gravity and speed
as well for the craft had risen by neutralizing and repelling the
earths gravitational attraction and here it was scudding
through the heavens like a projectile hurled from some huge
powerful rifle 

as it raced across the arched dome of blue at an altitude of
five miles the sky urchin was subject to scarcely a bump
the air seemed much smoother here than in the heavier atmos-
phere below as confident as a captain standing at the controls
of some great ocean liner professor marklcson watched the
dials in front of him and smiled as he made occasional readings
of velocity altitude gravitational pull resistance and internal
oxygen pressure

  then somehow the scientist experienced a vague premonition
of something untoward what it was he could not define he
felt certain that the perfect functioning of the ship would not
cease and thereby crash it to earth he tried to shake off the
feeling but try as he might he could not shun it it was as
though a sixth sense warned him that danger lurked near he
had a strange sensation of being watched from some invisible
source yet despite the foreboding that was marring an other-
wise perfect flight he smiled and did not allow his anxiety to
reach those who depended upon him for their very lives he
glanced around to read the faces that were arranged within the
cabin perhaps here he would find the eyes that penetrated his
being and caused him to shudder inwardly but no-the faces
were smiling none were looking at him directly each man
was either engaged at jotting notes or conversing softly with
his nearest neighbor the government men were looking out
through the band and talking earnestly the five men all
students of physical aviation and well-known to the scientist
were attending to their own business at their posts strangely
the feeling persisted upon him and as the sky urchin plunged
through a mass of fleecy clouds it grew gradually to certainty
someone was watching him intently no trying to avoid realiza-


air wonder stories

tion of the fact he felt it in his bones his subconscious mind
told him he knew it that was all i

                 chapter iii
                 the raid

when professor markleson suddenly felt a gentle pres-
sure as of a revolver in the small of his back he was
not surprised he expected something like that though
the feel of the blunt nose of the weapon made him try to turn
his head to get a glimpse of its owner not a word had been
said the scientist had merely heard a sudden scramble of feet
upon the cabin floor and then felt the gun poked into his back
no other sound except one high-pitched chuckle was audible
above the hissing of the sky urchin as it shot across the sky
that excitement ran high he could tell by the heavy breathing
of the man behind him and the occasional grunt of another

  then the man behind him spoke with startling suddenness in
a voice that sounded vaguely familiar to markleson if he could
but look at the figure of the man who he felt confident was
masked perhaps he could tell the identity of its owner with
his hands gripping the controls tightly he found himself won-
dering what sort of deviltry was going on with difficulty he
restrained a wild urge to swing around and face the man behind
him two things prevented him-the thought of the sky
urchin hurtling tlirough the air out of control and the firm
pressure of the pistol on his back

  mighty sorry professor the voice stated bluntly how
the voice startled him for an instant he thought he recognized
it and he pondered over it no that could not be dr jorgstedts
firm voice i hardly i the man continued just throttle her
down old top and float her in the air dont try anything
foolish or well have lo drop you i every one of you is covered
ive five men here and five searching the ship for any other
passengers

  without hesitation professor markleson slowed down the
velocity of the sky urchin his mind was blazing in a wave of
resentment as the indicator told him that the crafts speed had
diminished rapidly until it was barely making headway he
glanced through the observation band far below lay a great
expanse of flat terrain some far-flung frontier of the middle
west behind him he heard a sudden scuffle-then a sickening
thud one of his passengers had probably slumped to the floor
slugged for attempting to make a break he shot a sidelong
glance at the government men standing over to his right they
stood stiffly hands raised above their heads as though nothing
out of the ordinary was taking place the crew stood at their
posts faces in front of them fearful of turning around

  now professor i the man behind him said a mischievous
chuckle in his voice just hand over those papers that you have
in your inner pocket ill take care of the plans and details of
this ship from now on

  professor markleson felt suddenly sick-a nauseating sensa-
tion surged through his vitals had not the control wheel been
of stiff rigid metal his grip would have torn it loose from its
mooring he swayed slightly like a man in a daze and his lips
now tightly drawn and purple trembled

  i-i-havent got the plans with me he said lying they
were sent to my vault this morning 

  he felt the mans eyes boring into his back as the pistol was
snapped in a tight significant grip then the raider laughed
sharply it made the scientist wince for it dawned upon him
that a very dear friend had laughed just like that not many
hours before

  youre a mighty poor liar professor the man with the
pistol replied shoving it more firmly against his back the
scientist tensed expecting to feel a bullet plowing through his
flesh

a gloved hand swung over his shoulder and slid between
his jacket lapels it came forth with a sheaf of soiled
papers they crinkled softly as the mans gloved fist closed
over them in a firm grip the raider chuckled humorously and
bent close to the scientists ear

  i thank you professor most sincerely for your generosity i
he hissed professor markleson glanced sideways and beheld a
masked face from under which the neatly trimmed point of a
gray van dyke protruded the scientist stiffened opened his
mouth to speak thought better of it and smiled grimly if the
man actually was dr jorgstedt the world should never know
through his lips that his friend had degenerated he glanced
at the earth inductor compass to hide a surge of hot blood that
flooded his face the sky urchin was now hovering over the
flat brown terrain like some great silver mammal suddenly
shorn of its power to go on its nose was pointing due west
toward a dim outline of distant ranges the sun like a huge
ball of boiling metal hung low in a sky that was shot with
streaks of gold-edged clouds the masked raider who the
scientist concluded was the leader of the gang spoke again

  i thought a man of your calibre would have better sense
than to carry his plans with him so loosely but your laxity is
quite pardonable due to the excitement i presume of taking the
ship into the air perhaps this episode will teach you a lesson
now lower the ship to a landing you and your friends arc
going to leave it i

  professor markleson was at the point of making a hot reply
when suddenly the blunt pistol was jerked from his back it
exploded in his ear like a crack of thunder he heard the thud
of a body striking the floor and looked at the government men
one of them lay in a heap an automatic clutched in a grip
of death the top of his skull seemed to have been cloven the
raiders pistol once again nestled snugly into the scientists back
the man laughed

  self-defense on the last frontier i he chuckled loud guffaws
followed from the throats of his confederates the law of the
air is the law of the gun my dear professor and the air
belongs to him who takes it i i take it in the name of-
doctor- began professor markleson but he changed his
mind and spoke no name instead he said quietly i suppose
your trip to mars will be realized now eh

  the raiders boring eyes seemed to study the back of his
head for an instant
mars -mars  the man asked puzzled what in hell
would a man want to do on mars  but its a mighty good sug-
gestion professor i

  anyhow i think you are a dirty cad my friend i the scien-
tist hissed between his teeth as he swung a small lever that
placed the sky urchin under a gentle influence of the earths
gravitational pull it began to descend slowly but steadily the
masked raider chuckled

  ive been called worse things than that professor i he said
curtly so i take no offense at your mild epithet i dont like
to kill a man in cold blood anyhow but i advise you not to
interfere with us now or in the future i he bent his masked
face close to the scientists ear again and hisssed if you do
ill blast you from the face of the earth i

  if it were not for the lives of my friends here professor
markleson retorted hotly id kill the lot of you with a single
twitch of myfingers i

  the pistol in his back tensed again

  try it the raider invited

a foolhardy move

but professor markleson had no desire to kill his friends
and himself by throwing the huge sky urchin at the
mercy of the earths gravitational attraction had he felt in-
clined to do that the tremendous weight of tbe ship would have
carried it to the surface below like a plunging meteor to crash
the sky ruler



in a hopeless mass

  but you cant understand the controlling order of this ship i
professor markleson argued how did you get aboard
dont mislead yourself into thinking that we cant operate
this craft my dear professor i the man replied weve studied
every inch of her in your own hangar  getting aboard was
as easy as getting into the hangar despite your commendable
precautions theres nothing difficult in replacing the guards 
then why didnt you take the ship off yourself the scien-
tist asked incredulously the other laughed

  we are just as cautious as you were professor  he replied
i calculated that it would be easier to take her in the air and
perhaps a little more interesting from the standpoint of ad-
venture i

  do you realize where this little-adventure will lead you
why of course  admitted the skywayman to gold
riches power and perhaps a kingdom of my own i

the scientist stiffened but continued to argue nevertheless
you are wrong my friend  he growled it will lead you
to the gallows and ill be the one to see that you do hang
if necessary i shall devote the rest of my life to apprehending
you i will hound you to the death i

  then im afraid you wont live as long as you hope to the
raider snorted but ill give you a square chance to forget
about the sky urchin i i have the plans-i have the ship so
fear of being apprehended does not enter my mind it is cer-
tain that you cannot duplicate this hulk in a hurry i
perhaps not professor markleson sneered but  get
you eventually and ill live to see you swing

  professor markleson brought the huge sky urchin down on
the flat terrain as gently as if it were a feather the ground
was waist high in golden grain that shimmered like a sea of
yellow under soft evening breezes

  the raiders ten in all headed by a heavy set man of dr
jorgstedts proportions dressed in black close-fitting flight
garments his face hidden behind a black mask herded the sky
urchins passengers to the single exit and forced them to step
out professor markleson was the last to go he walked
steadily in front of the leader himself still feeling the blunt
muzzle of the automatic in his ribs he had had an excellent
opportunity to study the man absorbing each detail as he saw it
there was the gray point of the van dyke protruding from
underneath his mask yet the scientist could not entirely con-
vince himself that he had faced his friend dr jorgstedt if
indeed it was he the famous astronomers mind must suddenly
have gone berserk from the strain of his profession it seemed
almost unthinkable however that his old friend could have been
so completely transformed into a daring master crook i
as they neared the exit he made a sudden lunge at the masked
raider foolhardy of course in the face of almost instant death
from the cver-ready automatic he swung around with an un-
expectedness that nearly upset the raider his arm thumped the
gun hand of the man and sent it upward with a quick flick
of his hand he tried to pull the mask from his face then a
thunderous crash roared in his ears a bandit had moved be-
side his chief and brought the barrel of an automatic down with
terrific force on the hatless skull of the scientist he sank
to the floor without a sound

the brink of oblivion

what transpired next is hardly worthy of account it
might be said that the passengers were so confused and
bewildered that they scarcely knew what to do under the cir-
cumstances they formed a knot around the limp form of
professor markleson as the sky urchins doors closed and it
dropped away from the earth at a terrific velocity his head
was bathed in his own blood his features unrecognizable yet he
breathed after a fashion a piece of white paper fluttered from
his hands as they began to rub them a government man picked

it up glanced over a heavy scrawled message and swore he
read it again and again as though unable to grasp its ominous
significance there was no doubt that it had been inserted in
the clutching fingers of the scientist by the raider leader him-
self calling to his companions the official read the message
aloud

notice i

  i the sky ruler hereby claim the air as my owi domain
  until now the air has belonged lo no man and no law has
  been established to proclaim it a possession of any nation

  i therefore claim it as my ozvn dominion and am prepared
  to defend it at all costsl

                             signed the sky ruler

   within three hours the great presses of the world were rolling
off newspaper extras by the millions wires hummed with the
news of the daring coup of this desperate unknown man who
had set himself up as the ruler of the blue and the excited
world sat back fearfully and speculated upon the outcome

  while the world read the sensational newspaper accounts
given to it by the sky urchins erstwhile passengers and talked
over the possibility of an aerial dominion a corps of the nations
best physicians were struggling to save professor markleson
who was suffering with a fractured skull he lay in a hospital
in kansas city where his life hung in the balance for days
physicians and nurses worked over him feverishly well know-
ing the importance of this man in the world of science his
advanced age was against him but some great reserve of
strength seemed to carry him through while surgeons re-
moved the fragments of splintered bone that were making pres-
sure upon his brain

  meanwhile the sky urchin had vanished into thin air not a
trace of it had been discovered as though the great monster
of the upper reaches had flown far out into the vast emptiness
of space that is the universe it disappeared powerful telescopes
scrutinized the heavens the aerial police ceaselessly searched
the air-all without success

for many days professor markleson hovered on the verge
oi death and during all this time the whereabouts of the
sky urchin remained a mystery whether it liad fallen under
control of unknowing hands in sonic isolated place on the far-
flung fringes of civilization the world had no way of determin-
ing then suddenly out of a clear sky the silvered monster
appeared over washington at an altitude tliat made her com-
pletely inaccessible to man and his air-screwed craft huge
flocks of government planes took off at once only to return to
earth their screws useless in the rarefied air of the higher
levels their pilots exhausted and numbed from cold and lack
of oxygen

  the great ship hung in the higher reaches like a bar of
glistening platinum from the ground it appeared no larger
than a full-sized cigar yet it seemed a thing of ominous intent
even the president stood upon the white house balcony and
gazed at it through powerful glasses wondering what manner
of man it was who had proclaimed himself the sky ruler he
was soon however to learn something about the mans inten-
tions if not of the man himself for even as he watched he
saw a tiny missile suddenly detacli itself from the huge air-
craft it came hurtling earthward like a bomb in a straight
line before the president could realize what was happening
the missile hit scarcely a hundred yards away in the center of
the park across the avenue

  when it failed to explode a half dozen army officers raced to
it and tugged it out of the ground it was an aerial bomb and
no mistake but a hollow dud they at once unscrewed the nose
cap taking their lives in their hands in doing so from the open
end came a neatly rolled paper without opcniug the silken


air wonder stories

cord that was wound around it they returned at once to the
white house the president vanished from the gallery to hold
council with the secretary of war and other department ex-
ecutives the army officers delivered the paper at once and
stood away at attention the secretary of war opened it and
handed it over to the president the chief executives face
reddened as he read to himself a bold daring message that the
sky ruler had sent to him then handing the parchment to his
secretary he settled back while it was read aloud

    to the president of the united states

  you have just become aware of the accuracy of my high-
  explosive missiles luckily for the white house  have
  no quarrel with the united states-as yet i can stand
  away at an altitude of  miles and blow every city in
  your country to dust do you realise that mr president f
  but i do not desire war with any nation what i demand
  is that my domain which is the skies-the last frontier-be
  free from air vessels of nations that do not pay a fixed
  monthly toll that will be assessed to each government five
  million dollars per month is to be paid by the united states
  to send your tolls proceed as follows use one of the large
  navy blimps place the money in the basket with your list
  of craft release the blimp above the white house and
  we shall intercept it we shall hover over the capital city
  of each nation once each month for tolls pay-day for the
  united states will be on the second wednesday of each
  month be ready to deliver one week from today unless
  the toll is paid all craft flying through my dominion after
  that date will be destroyed at oncel

                            signed the sky ruler

  hardly had the excitement of the sky urchins visit died
down in washington than the cables began to hum with news
that the sky ruler had delivered the same ultimatum to the
french government hot on its heels came word to the ameri-
can presses that great britain would be forced to suspend air
travel until the demands were met then germany sent news
of its woes and finally japan radioed the appearance of the
silver hulk over tokyo

  but the newspapers glared with heartening headlines declar-
ing that the sky ruler could not be everywhere at the same
time american aircraft henceforth flew about their business
at the lower altitudes as though the sky urchin had never ex-
isted but one day a great air-lincr limped into lakehurst from
liverpool with her laterals virtually torn away her officers
told a story of having met the sky urchin in mid-air over the
azores and how upon refusing to halt her steering gear had
been damped by a bomb exploding near her tail but strangely
she had been allowed to proceed without further molestation
it had evidently been a warning-no more no less i as a result
the skies became suddenly void of aircraft and aerial transpor-
tation was suspended by the american government until further
notice

  it seems strange that a single airship could so terrify the
world  but when the super-powers of that ship are taken into
consideration the reason was apparent the sky urchin could
fly faster higher and farther than any other aircraft in exis-
tence and it did not require any futuristic weapons in enforc-
ing its demands  a few well-placed bombs would turn the
trick as well as any death ray that might come out of the brain
of some imaginative science fiction writer

  when japan refused to meet the demands of a half million
dollars a month several of its cities were laid in ruins before
appearing over washington again the cunning ruler of the
skies waited until the news of his approach had preceded him
in consequence the government delivered exactly five million
dollars in gold to the sky urchin the navy blimp was then
ballasted and sent down to earth with a note of thanks only

                                                            

then was aerial transportation resinned again with renewej
vigor as though to make up for the loss

chapter iv

a hopeless battle

  a ll this had transpired while professor markleson lay on
- a white bed tucked away in isolation in a kansas city
hospital a silver plate had been inserted in his skull
to take the place of the portion of bone that was removed
government authorities were watching his case with undimin-
ished interest for in that brain which was now protected un-
der an artificial plate lay a secret which they would give much
to learn sooner or later the people of the united states would
rebel against the monthly tribute that must be paid its only
hope of release from the obligation lay in the building of air-
craft capable of competing with the sky urchin and such
craft could not be obtained unless they sprang from the brain
of the bedridden scientist

  the government had interviewed each and every man who
had worked on the construction of the sky urchin with pro-
fessor markleson but none possessed knowledge of the ships
intricate details even the superintendent who had supervised
the work in the absence of the scientist-inventor could offer
no help although he remembered certain things he stated
that professor marklcson alone could solve the problem

  slowly professor markleson began to mend his returning
health was guarded constantly and gradually he began to no-
tice objects in his private room slowly but surely he came
out of the coma that had held him in a death-like grip for
weeks

  but now the world anticipating his recovery was destined
to receive a tremendous shock when professor markleson
was finally able to be visited it was found that his memory was
entirely gone i of the sky urchin he knew nothing and looked
at me oddly when the ship was mentioned to him the name
was as meaningless as something spoken in an alien tongue
when he was addressed respectfully as professor by govern-
ment officials he stared around the room blankly as though
trying to discover an invisible personage his was a hopeless
case and the officials left him with consternation plainly written
on their downcast features

  swiftly another monthly toll day approached the united
states behind locked and guarded doors the presidents cabi-
net held consultation with the war department what trans-
pired behind those locked-doors was not known until the toll
day arrived then the government sent up to the waiting sky
ruler a blimp that carried nothing but a small piece of white
paper in a steel-bound chest at the same time the air was
alive with all types of air craft flying at low altitudes govern-
ment ships remained on the ground within hangars but their
crews were spinning and singing with desire to have the re-
taining blocks removed from under the landing gear

  whether the sky ruler suspected a trap when he read the
contents on the strip of paper was not known it told him
plainly in good old yankee parlance to go to hell i and it
must have ruffled his pride for the sky urchin was immediate-
ly seen to dive headlong toward the earth under the controlled
forces of its gravity repellants and rockets as though its
pilots were in a hot rage the ship plunged down into the lanes
of air travel and began at once to rake all scurrying craft with
explosives from some strange-looking gun batteries several
huge lighter-than-air passenger liners plunged out of the air at
once and spewed death and destruction on the ground below

then suddenly the challenge was met as five hundred
army pursuit planes were hauled out of their hangars and
in perfect formation shot into the skies like birds of prey
caught in the lower air levels the sky urchin seemed helpless
the sky ruler

against the sudden onslaught from below one single anti-
aircrift gun roared and a shell smashed high above the silvered
hulk then the big gun silenecd fearful lest its missiles take
harvest in the government planes

  like a swarm of flies attacking an eagle the army planes
swung straight for the hovering hulk machine guns spitting
and rattling but sending slugs that were wholly ineffectual
against the thick metal of the sky urchins hull the sky
ruler aimed his guns and raked the ranks of his attackers
seven planes hurtled earthward in flames but the fighting spirit
of the american pilots kept the others in the hopeless fray

  presently as though tiring of sending the whirling planes
down in flames the sky urchin heeled and swung away from
the earth in a graceful half-turn that would have torn to shreds
any air-liner less rigid the buzzing planes continued after
her but were outdistanced almost at once ten miles up the
huge monster hovered and dropped a missile into a washington
square the united states was given one more chance to
meet the obligation without waiting for a reply yellow
flames shot from the stern of the sky urchin and under the
pressure of its driving exhausts it shot across the skies like
a comet vanishing in the distance

  around the world went the sky urchin visiting every na-
tion of any importance on the globe from what was cabled
the united states learned that every nation had met the de-
mands without a single attempt to destroy the daring ruler of
the skies a sky ruler he was indeed i for one man and
one great ship to be able to stand off and dictate to the world
was beyond a doubt the most daring piece of piracy civilization
had ever known word leaked to america from russia that
the ship had landed there to take on supplies as it had on two
occasions landed at the dunmar chemical works in new jer-
sey to fake on fuel the raiders had even gone so far as to
order the factory to prepare a great store of fuel and had paid
for it in advance company officials refused to disclose where
it was to be delivered fearing that the leakage would be de-
tected and the entire plant blown to destruction by the sky
ruler for revenge

a sudden recognition

such was the state of affairs when one day a serious-faced
young man walked up the spotless white steps in front of
the capitol and demanded an interview with the secretary of
war for more than an hour he waited until finally his im-
patience was getting the best of him and he got up and renewed
his demands stating that his mission was one of great impor-
tance to the world and that if the secretary did not wish to see
him he would at once set sail for england needless to say
that he was admitted at once and that he stared at the official
with open contempt when he beheld him sitting in an easy
chair in his sanctum nochalantly smoking an aromatic cigar as
though his mind was free from the trying cares of the nations
affairs

  i am jack reeves who acted as superintendent for pro-
fessor markleson during the construction of the sky urchin
sir i he introduced himself with little formality i dislike to
interrupt your little afternoon siesta but i thought the united
states might be interested in a little invention i have perfected

  well   the secretary boomed appraising him sus-
piciously

  as i said i was superintendent to professor markleson dur-
ing the construction of the sky urchin the young man re-
plied unshaken by the severity of the others voice so i am
pretty well acquainted with the ship which is now creating so
much anxiety in all parts of the world though as you are
probably aware i am not so familiar with the craft as to be
able to outline all its internal details i have been an under-
study of professor markleson for five years at the american
institute of physics and for a long time i have studied the

plausibility of a magnetic ray by which to attract aircraft to
earth

   what has that got to with the sky urchinf the secretary
 asked laying his cigar aside and peering into the young mans
 face quizzically

   just this your honor jack reeves replied meeting his
 stare on equal terms i believe ive perfected a magnetic
 ray of such power an that i can force the sky urchin to earth
 under the influence of its attraction i

   

   while young jack reeves calm and confident was interview-
 ing the secretary of war a pathetic drama in the lives of two
 of the worlds most brilliant men was being enacted in the
 lounge of the scientists club

   for a week every known effort had been resorted to in order
 to effect a return of memory in the brain of professor markle-
 son many old acquaintances were brought before him but
 while his eyes would seem to brighten occasionally at sight of
 some friend recognition refused to assert itself in his stunned
 deadened mind friends had beguiled him to visit his old
 haunts in the hope that the sight of these would restore his
 memory on this particular day he had been taken to the
 lounging room of the scientists club where for hours he sat
 in a big loose chair while doctors stood about hoping he would
 recognize the appointments in the room with which he had
 once been very familiar he stared curiously at familiar faces
 but for the life of him he could not recall ever having known
 a single one of them there was not a man in that room who
 was not appraised by the blank eyes of the famous scientist and
 many of those present could boast of knowing him intimately

   presently another familiar face and figure came into the
 lounge from the wide hall beyond he too came under the ap-
 praising eyes of professor markleson there was something
 familiar about the gray pointed van dyke as worn by dr
 jorgstedt  yes professor markleson felt deep within his
 soul that he had seen that beard and those deep set features be-
 fore - he covered his aching eyes with a trembling hand and
 then looked again at the man approaching him with eyes
 upon the gray pointed tip of that van dyke nerves tensed
 to the snapping point his brain whirling with a maelstrom of
 faces objects and events the scientist suddenly seemed to grow
 rigid-then leapt from his chair with a blood-curdling yell i
 roaring with the cry of a blood-thirsty beast professor
 markleson lunged forward despite his weakened condition
 and taxed strength he dashed across the lounge with astound-
 ing swiftness and with a half dozen bounds his once powerful
 fingers clutched the throat under the gray van dyke

 taken unawares in the act of greeting his old friend
 dr jorgstedt seemed stunned by this unexpected out-
 burst of hostility on the part of the famous physicist before
 he had a chance to defend himself from the others savage
 rush cruel fingers were biting into his jugular vein cutting
 off his wind and throttling him mercilessly he went down at
 once under the superior weight of the scientist whose weakened
 legs tried vainly to hold him while his hands began to choke
  the life from the astronomers body

   friends galvanized into action after a moment of astonish-
 ment and pulled them apart professor markleson struggled
 to break loose and get at the astronomer once again but he was
 held tightly he vented his rage in stinging epithets dr
 jorgstedt shook himself free and stared at his former friend
 in open-mouthed astonishment

   you might at least have shaven off your filthy whiskers
 doctor jorgstedt i professor markleson raged i recognized
 you and you know it i let me loose my friends my fingers
 itch to tear open his dirty throat

doctor jorgstedt stared in amazement around the circle of


air wonder stories

faces that regarded him inquiringly he was suddenly be-
wildered at the strange hostile attitude of professor markle-
son and was plainly alarmed a man near him spoke softly

  as you know professor markleson has been under extreme
physical difficulties doctor he said and is not accountable
for his actions he is probably laboring under an illusion
and does not recognize you

  thats a lie the physicist shouted struggling to release
himself he is doctor jorgstedtl i recognize everything
nowl you my good friend are professor brandon i i can
name every one of you now my memory was restored by a
sight of the filthy features before me doctor jorgstedt you
arc responsible for hideous treachery for the sake of our
long-standing friendship i swore not to disclose your degener-
acy i but i will change that sworn oath here and nowl i
will maintain the secret on one condition and that is-that the
sky urchin be returned to me within forty-eight hours

  but my dear professor i replied jorgstedt iu the most com-
plete bewilderment i dont know a tiling in the world about the
sky urchin other than what has appeared in the newspapers
i dont know what youre talking about though quite plainly
you accuse me jf something in which i must deny all guilt
on the day before the scheduled take-off of the sky urchin i
was instructed by the astronomical society to investigate a me-
teorite which had fallen in southern texas until my return
this very morning i have been there continuously i left here
in such haste tliat i could not accompany you on the ships
maiden flight hence my failure to be on hand for such a glori-
ous event you simply have confused me with somebody else
i can prove in short order the length of my stay in texas
understanding the terrible experiences you have gone through
dear professor markleson all i can say is that i am sorry
from my heart and tliat i will overlook this great personal in-
justice you have just forced upon me who have been your
dearest friend since boyhood i

  professor markleson shook himself loose from the arms that
had held him and stood free glaring into the troubled con-
tenance of the astronomer he noted tliat jorgstcdts face had
taken on a heavy coat of tan tliat had not been there before
nor could such a nut-brown color be obtained within the con-
fines of the sky urchin unless he had stood in the sun light
on the control bridge exposed to the violet rays that beat down
through the transparent observation bands even then many
weeks of constant exposure could liardly create such a deep tone
as the scientists mind clearly considered all this he felt
puzzled and downcast as though his mind had been playing
him tricks did he really now remember the van dyke beard

  do you mean to say you were not on the sky urchin at any
time dr jorgstedt he asked his eyes suddenly becoming
moist and glassy are you certain of it

  perfectly certain my friend he replied meeting his eyes
squarely beyond seeing her pictures in the newspapers i
have never set eyes on the sky urchin

  then will you accept my sinccrcst my profoundest apology
for my actions my dear friend said markleson earnestly
striding forward with hand outstretched i will try to make
amends by explaining a case of mistaken identity

  i concluded that your actions resulted from something like
that jorgstedt replied grasping the hand of his friend in a
warm affectionate clasp the other party must certainly have
been a ringer for me 

  from what i could see of him he was  the physicist replied
taking the astronomer by the arm and leading him to a far
corner where they sat down out of earshot of the others

fir a long time they sat in earnest friendly conversation

what was being said between them no one in the room
seemed to hear nor to care about for that matter all were
too much engaged in discussing their own affairs to eavesdrop
on others professor markleson explained himself thoroughly

omitting not a single detail of his experience he illustrated
the close similarity between the famous astronomer and the sky
ruler himself although he had only seen enough of the lattcrs
beard to arouse his suspicions he conceded presently that that
alone was insufficient for his resulting conclusions but in ad-
dition the voice had sounded amazingly like the doctors

  then the sky ruler still remains a mystery i said dr jorg-
stedt by way of closing the unpleasant incident of the recent
past what a wonderful ship he must have stolen

  still a mystery doctor i the physicist said suddenly tired
and weary the sky urchin is a wonderful ship indeed i
doubt if i could ever build another because of one complicated
mechanical system the thief took the plans-the ship-every-
thing it must be recaptured without damage to protect the
plans which arc doubtlessly on board if by any chance they
have been disposed of to a foreign power-and i dont think
they have been-then we must liave the ship itself so that we
can build more like her she is immune to present methods of
attack though i know that i could devise a means to destroy
her but we must have her intact 

  do you suppose that this sky ruler is by any possibility
one of the men you had working for you on the ships con-
struction dr jorgstedt asked

  professor markleson shook his head

  my men were all students from the american institute of
physics he replied not one of them had a chance to grow
a van dyke of course that might have been a disguise but i
doubt if any of our boys had ever thought of such a daring
scheme as the sky ruler has pulled no doctor i dont be-
lieve so

  have you any other suspicions the astronomer queried

  the scientist regarded him with curiosity somehow he did
not seem satisfied with the sincerity of that last question it
appeared to have been asked guardedly as though trying to
feel him out for all he could give his eyes narrowed as he
beheld a slight unnatural tremble in his friends hands

  no my friend the physicist replied trying to speak casual-
ly but watching theothcrs face intently i have no other
suspicions i

  the astronomer smiled oddly his lips drawn tight across firm
white teeth the scientists turned his head to regard a group
of men standing nearby he could have sworn that he felt
again a pair of boring eyes penetrating his back turning quick-
ly he discovered that dr jorgstedt liad been studying him in-
tently the latters face reddened above his tan and he smiled
curiously

  well professor he said rising and flexing his arms
im mighty tired and i must make a report to the society
guess ill run along meanwhile take good care of yourself
and forget the events of the evening good day my friend

  professor marklesons eyes followed him a little suspiciously
as he strode swiftly across the floor and vanished beyond the
curve in the hall there was he decided a mighty close simi-
larity between that figure and the athletic frame of the sky
ruler he slapped a knee and swore at his suspicions he
squared his shoulders then feeling the sudden effects of the
strenuous events that had made his mind normal again he got
up and went out

chapter v

markleson returns

on the sky urchin the self-asserted ruler of the heavens
lolled lazily in the big spacious chair in the rear cab-
in lighted through the transparent bank and casually
studied a sheaf of plans the huge silver hulk was cruising
across the higher reaches at moderate speed far below lay
the earth which at the sky urchins great altitude appeared
like a tremendous ball glowing slightly under the effects of a
the sky ruler



midday sun and from the earth the ship was invisible to the
naked eye only through powerful telcscopes could it have
been brought close enough for observation

  the sky ruler puffed nonchalantly on a cigar frequently
stroking his pointed gray van dyke with a slightly trembling
hand as he regarded the plans sheet after sheet came under
his peculiar boring eyes as if he was filing each single detail
of the sky urchins structure in the pigeon holes of his brain
whether he contemplated building other ships of the type
through the enormous funds at his command was hard to decide
because his features were deep set and unfathomable

  presently a small hook-nosed man appeared at the door
leading from the ships promenade companionway to the rear
observation cabin he was dressed in khaki breeches blue
shirt and officers boots on his head was an aviators helmet
his eyes seemed heavy with sleep

  im going on duty at the controls now chief he said in
a piping voice what course shall we set

  the sky ruler glanced up from the plans and nodded
how would you like to land her on old pock-face slat-
tery he asked drawing at his cigar and throwing a booted
leg over the arm of his chair

  the moon slattery queried with an expression of alarm
precisely i the sky ruler replied a humorous smile play-
ing about the sides of his mouth

  wouldnt be very keen on it chief i he replied his face
paling i dont reckon the others would want to risk such
a flight even in this hulk of course if you say the word-
naw not yet slattery i the self-styled air ruler chuckled
i was just feeling you out but we might take a shot at the
moon one of these days ive always wanted to explore it i
seems to havea powerful influence over me lets see this
is sunday better set a straight course for berlin slattery
tomorrows pay-day for the germans

   okay chief i the pilot replied relieved in a hurry
not much the sky ruler replied turning again to his
plans take it easy 

  slattery turned on his heel and swung through the companion-
way toward the nose of the ship where he relieved the pilot
on duty and took hold of the controls he changed the shy
urchins course slightly to the north-east and then sat down
in a comfortable wicker chair at the controls

  but while the sky ruler was taking life serenely as though
he had not a care in the world activity was feverish in the
laboratories of the american institute of physics in washing-
ton a half dozen senior students of the institute headed
by young jack reeves were assembling the various sections
of ome strange piece of mechanism that was rapidly taking
definite shape in a flat railroad car that had been tracked into
the huge laboratory of physics

perspiring with hands grimy and face soiled the eager
young men worked side by side silently placing various
sections of the apparatus in final shape for a general assemblage
jack reeves as greasy as his subordinates struggled with a
medium-sized steel drum that appeared to have been shorn from
a sphere of metal inside this device he was inserting great
spools of copper wire he looked up at the touch of a hand
on his shoulder he had been so interested in his work that
he had failed to hear the sound of scraping feet behind him
as he beheld the features that met him squarely his grimy
face lit up with instant joy

  professor markleson he cried shoving a soiled palm for-
ward the hand was taken despite its grime god im glad
to see you sir i how are you professor

  the scientists features beamed as he wrung the hand of this
young understudy he seemed eager and refreshed and his
eyes flashed as keen as a youngsters

   im all right son he replied glancing around feel fine
but whats all this paraphernalia  still working out your mag-

netic ray hypothesis jack

   the young scientist grinned sheepishly

  not working it out professor he said grimly just
finishing it up i ive just about perfected it i

  you have the professor was pleasantly amazed going
to kill airplane engines in mid-air eh

   of course you could not have learned the real reason for
building this outfit now sir jack replied warmly we arc
not going to waste any time experimenting with airplane mo-
tors this device is especially designed to attract metallic
bodies from the air 

   professor markleson regarded him through brightening eyes
his lips suddenly began to tremble as though he had just
realized the importance that certain metallic bodies had been
playing in the scheme of things in the heavens he grasped tlic
significance of the young mans words at once he placed both
hands on jacks shoulders and shook him gently

   do you mean son he said peering into the others eyes
that your magnetic ray as outlined to me before is a success
have you actually pcrfccted it

   you know ive been trying to work out a magnetic ray for
a long time that would attract metal at a distance sir the
young physicist replied i figured to be able someday to pull
aircraft to earth with dead engines firmly attached to the tip
of a magnetic beam-invisible of course

   hmi said markleson just what is your idea

   what i do began reeves eagerly  is to ionize the air
by bombarding it with electrons from my projector what i
do in short is to establish a new attractive force for a body
so that it is pulled to my projector just as it is ordinarily pulled
toward the center of the earth

  hm pretty deep markleson commented i dont get it
offhand but the important thing is that youve succeeded
yes to a large extent sir the grimy young scientist re-
plied but i dont seem to be able to keep the ray from
spreading out in fan shape after it leaves the projection tubes
and im not exactly satisfied with its range i have brought
down a small captive balloon with metal attached to it from
a -foot altitude im not certain how far this larger de-
vice will project the ray my model operated all right

   thats wonderful jack said the scientist enthusiastically
 is there anything i can do to help you

   jack reeves studied the scientists features for a long minute
 his eyes flashing

   do you mean it-that you are able to work sir  he asked
able the professor snorted im as fit as a stack of
fiddles i

   then youll find yoor overalls laundered and ready for you
in your locker sir the young man replied you understand
my ideas thoroughly i shall step aside and allow you full
charge from now on i

the magnetic ray

donning overalls tin scientist appraised the flat car
upon it a strong tower of well insulated metal rose like
a narrow pyramid toward the domed roof of the laboratory
the base was attached to the heavy car with insulated studs
bolted down tight that the tower was complete and ready to
accommodate the remainder of the apparatus he could see at
once jack reeves stood by his side watching him with pride

   thats the combined anchoring and broadcast tower sir
he said the device on which i was working when you
came in fits on a gyroscopic principle on top of the tower so
that it can be swung in any direction except downward down
here will be mounted the controls-the rheostat controls which
will regulate the magnetic current as it enters the projection
tube attached to the gyroscopic drum i have also developed in
the rheostat a method for regulating the range of the in-
visible beam on my model the controls governed the ray


air wonder stories

up to  feet and the projector practically sucked the
beam back into the projection tube with results that i brought
the balloon down to earth i can hardly believe it myself its
so marvelous there was a terrific wind when i caught it but
it could not pull loose from the magnetic influence inwhich
the beam held it captive the full-sized magnetic ray pro-
jector is being built to project a beam capable of attracting
even the sky urchin to it	

   the sky urcliinf the professor regarded him quizzically
you couldnt touch the sky urchin with a magnetic ray
jack i the ship is insulated against magnetic or gravitational
attraction son i

   yes it is the young scientist conceded but you seem to
forget sir that only the central section is placed under the
electromagnetic repulsion influence for stabilizing purposes
that leaves both ends of the sky urchin open for attraction
because they are operated from the center section by insulating
quartz bands my invisible magnetic beam 

   pardon my interruption jackl said the scientist his feat-
ures stern and severe have you taken this matter up with
the government

   i have sir he answered the secretary of war has
appropriated  for the construction of this device it
has already been patented and my model is safe in the ar-
chives of the patent office considering your past experience
in having your plans and ship stolen i took ample steps to
protect my invention before such a thing could happen to me i
i congratulate you son i the professor said patting him on
the back affectionately his eyes assumed a strange light one
that had existed in them when he told the sky ruler on that
eventful day in emphatic terms that he would spend the rest
of his days hounding him until he was hanged i and seeing
only the sky urchin held captive to the tip of an invisible
magnetic ray he set to work with a vigor that his life had
never before experienced

but young jack reeves had been so thorough in his re-
search that very few changes were required to make the
ray an effective weapon indeed he and the scientist worked
tirelessly side by side at the bench on the more intricate details
of the magnetic ray projector while the senior students pre-
pared the rest during the five years he had spent as pro-
fessor marklesons understudy jack reeves had become very
proficient he had been given many opportunities to work
out his own theories at the personal expense of the generous
kind-hearted scientist and as for markleson-when he got
into the details of his ray device his heart sang with bound-
less praise for this young man who realizing the desperate
straits in which the world had found itself since the sky
urchin was stolen had begun to apply his genius to its appre-
hension the scientist knew at once when he looked at the
plans that here indeed was an instrument as important to man
as the sky urchin itself

   here was an invention that would be invaluable to any na-
tion-one that could be utilized nation-wide in time of peace as
well as war sky bandits could be brought to earth under the
influence of this magnetic beam enemy aircraft could be mag-
netized from it and attracted down helpless in the firm grip of
magnetic force i
the days of the sky urchin and its cargo of daring crooks
were numbered i
the ending of the sky rulers tremendous power was not
far off now i he had dared alone to make the entire world
do his bidding he dared to think that he was invincible in
control of such a great air cruiser as the sky urchin but he
underestimated science by a long long shot professor markle-
son chuckled to himself as he worked running those thoughts
over and over in his mind yes the sky ruler had built castles
in the air but at the pull of a magnetic ray these castles were
soon to topple to earth i

chapter vi
an unbreakable grip

there came a day when the sky was queerly void of
aircraft nowhere in the heavens could there be seen
a ship of any type but that was not a strange occur-
rence now it had happened several times during the past few
months especially when the day had arrived for the sky urchin
to appear in the upper air levels eady to rake the sky with
its all too accurate machine guns and deadly bombs

   once again toll day for the united states had arrived and
this time the government was to choose between paying the
sky rulers demands or having the continent plunged into
mourning true the government had plainly told the sky
ruler to go to hell on his last visit and liad gotten away with
it but now it was a case of cither paying two months toll
or having new york washington and other big cities laid
in ruins the sky ruler had demanded exactly ten million
dollars in gold under a threat to drop a dozen high-explosive
missiles right into the heart of washington

  but what the sky ruler expected was one thing and what
he actually received was another he had plunged the sky
urchin across the heavens like a comet from the westward its
driving exhausts causing a five-mile-long tail of purple flame to
scar the skies from its rear even at its great altitude the hiss
of the crafts open exhausts was audible to those who watched
it tensely from an isolated area on the outskirts of washing-
ton over the capitol buildings ten miles up the sky urchin
halted hovering as easily in the rarefied air as an ocean vessel
anchored in the safety of its harbor

   as professor markleson watchcd his stolen airship through
powerful binoculars tensed almost to the snapping point with
excitement and undying hatred he observed that the huge mon-
ster of the skies lay aloft with scarcely a movement he saw
a tiny object detach itself from the elly of the glistening
hulk and plunge earthward he watched its downward descent
until it vanished behind a screen of trees expecting momen-
tarily to hear the crashing roar of high explosives he sat in
tense suspense scarcely breathing but no such explosion
echoed to his ears it was just another of the sky rulers
sensational messages though how it read he could not know

  he manipulated the range gauge on the binoculars and
brought the silvery hulk even closer he thought he saw a
movement on the control deck through the transparent fore-
ward band but he was not certain then another missile
dropped suddenly from the great craft with an increasing
whistle it approached the earth straight down was it an-
other message or had the sky ruler become enraged at the
delay in sending up the blimp that was to deliver to him ex-
actly ten million in gold bullion

  hardly had professor markleson dropped a hand to signal
to young jack reeves who sat at the rheostat controls of the
magnetic ray projector when the echo of a terrific explosion
rent his ears the roar stunned him for an instant as his hand
dropped the earth seemed to tremble under the thunderous
concussion and he saw a mass of swirling debris and dust ris-
ing scarcely a mile away

jack reeves sitting at the controlling instruments nestl-
ing under the base of the projection tower on the flaj car
bent over the apparatus instantly his nimble fingers twisted
a series of rheostat control dials and the gyroscopic drum on
top of the tower began to move in a slow rotating motion he
touched the gyrostat dial and the drum like a huge round-
backed searchlight began to rotate on its jointed axis with
an ominous whirring back and forth up and over it swung
until suddenly it stood rigid with a jerk

what markleson saw through his binoculars caused him to
let out an excited yell at once he was surrounded by a group
jhe sky ruler



of army officers who concentrated their attention upon the
shining hulk far above but jack reeves remained at his post
bent over the controlling apparatus which to a layman would
have seemed nothing more than an ordinary box-radio with
its dials exposed to him

  the sky urchin floating lazily in the higher reaches ap-
peared to snap its glistening nose slightly earthward with a
jerk as it some visible hand had pulled itl its tail shot up at
a forty degree angle with a suddenness that astounded even
professor markleson himself the scientist through his glass
concentrated his gaze upon the foreward insulation band
through it he could sec indistinguishable figures darting about
in bewilderment as though held captive by an invisible leash
attached to a bull ring on the end of its pike-like snout the
sky urchin stood rigid with its nose on an angle pointing di-
rectly at the drum atop the projection tower i

  invisible as it was professor markleson knew that the
magnetic ray had drawn the sky urchins nose within its in-
fluence to be held in an unbreakable grip to the end of the
beam i but somehow they had overlooked the possibility of
the grip being broken by a sudden splurge of power from the
ships propulsion rockets

  from behind the sky urchin there came suddenly a terrific
roar a score of long yellow jets of flame shot from its ex-
hausts with a recoil tliat threatened to rip it to pieces the
craft lurched earthward with a terrific force then with a
startling abruptness that must have hurled its crew in all di-
rections its rapid descent was checked while its tail began
to swing around in great circles under the tremendous power
that must have emanated from the exhausts the sky urchin
spun around with its nose held like a captive fish desperately
seeking its freedom

  professor markleson let go his binoculars they dangled at
the end of a loop slung around his neck he danced with glee
and yelled like a madman even the army officers-veterans
-all seemed elated their faces were wreathed with smiles
but then something happened that was unforeseen by the vic-
torious group around markleson

caught again

when the flat car bearing the magnetic ray projector
had left the american institute laboratory it had rolled
over a hastily laid track in the center of which was a high-tension
third-rail to supply the apparatus with the necessary voltage
there came suddenly a blinding flash of high potential elec-
tricity from underneath the flat car instantly the projection
machine went out of commission then under full force of its
driving exhausts the great sky urchin shot like a falling
comet toward the earth stunned and foolish the scientist and
the officers stood still too much awed to move as the glisten-
ing hulk bore down upon them it roared through the heavens
like some tremendous terrestrial monster traveling on an angle
that would carry it scarcely more than a few thousand feet
above them

  with a disheartened groan professor markleson threw him-
self flat on the ground in an effort to escape death by cre-
mation from the blazing wake of the oncoming menace with
his face buried in his hands he lay there tense as the hissing
roar increased above him until he felt that the sky urchin
could not be more than a mile away he expected moment-
arily to feel the flame from its exhausts scorching his flesh
to ashes he pictured the end-the stark ruination of the
magnetic ray projector  his mind whirled with scenes of
death and destruction then he cursed himself for a blithering
idiot for not having jumped at once underneath the flat car
to learn the cause of the disaster

  he shot a glance at the sky urchin it had now flattened
on even keel and was hurtling across the sky some  feet
up is exhausts driving it to full velocity as though the pilots
were endeavoring to escape with their lives instantly lie leapt

up and made a dash for the car stooping low he literally
hurled himself under it bumping his shoulder on the platform
with a numbed hand he grasped a contact wire that hung loose
nd away from its shoe careful lest he touch bare copper or
steel he plunged the wire onto the rail amid a shower of
crackling green sparks at once he discovered that the wire
had jumped from its socket in the shoe that traced the rail
wasting valuable seconds he jammed the bare end of the cable
into the socket gave it an extra shove and rolled away from
it he sat up on the ground well away from the car and rubbed
his smarting eyes if he had ever faced death in all his life
he had certainly confronted it under the car but he had no
time to realize the fact it was a humane act of providence
that he escaped without more than stinging eyes as the result
of the high-tension flashes and spark showers 

  young jack reeves sitting at the controls of his invention
cast a frightened glance at his benefactor but he refused to
quit his post aware that the current had once again thrown
his magnetic beam into the air he concentrated immediately
upon the rheostats above him swung the drum in rapid spas-
modic rotation projecting its invisible magnetic beam into the
heavens nervously searching like a searchlight for its objec-
tive he twisted the rheostats with tense bloodless fingers in-
creasing the range of the beam to near capacity the sky
urchin had vanished into the distant skies yet not so far but
that the beam with the speed of light caught up with it the
young scientist gave a yell when the projector stood suddenly
rigid facing the direction which the monster of the air had
taken he threw on full power at once and the apparatus
hummed with a terrific throb

he touched a button switch that threw into action the re-
traction units glancing at the range dials he saw the
indicator slowly pushing toward zero he grasped a dial
eagerly and increased the retraction until the indicator swung
over its orbital course more rapidly the drum-like projector
shooting its invisible magnetic ray faced the east rigid and
taut with a joyous shout he leapt down off the car and dashed
to professor marklesons side the scientist was dusting his
clothing in his eagerness jack grabbed him brusquely and
swung him around

  weve got her he yelled pointing eastward weve got
her where she cant break loose

  professor markleson lifted his binoculars eastward sure
enough the sky urchin hung low in the distant heavens like
a huge fish hooked by the tail to an invisible line slowly very
slowly she was being drawn tail first back toward the pro-
jection tower

  he handed the glasses to his understudy reeves stared
at the captive for a long minute and then returned them his
face drawn tight with excitement and anticipation held on
the tip of the powerful beam the sky urchin was being auto-
matically returned

   better take a look at the cable on the third-rail shoe son
the scientist advised tensely i dont know how well i jammed
it in we dont want it to pull loose again if it docs were
sunk

   ill look at it sir  the young scientist replied he crawled
under the flat car at once returned to a tool chest picked out
a hammer and again disappeared there came the rythmic
thuds of hammer blows professor markleson looked again
at the captive ship she was much nearer now and no longer
did yellow flame sear the sky she seemed to have given up
the fight but the scientist felt tliat the desperate crew was not
yet ready to lay down its arms and surrender he smiled grimly
as he watched jack reeves climb again to his post on the flat
car brilliant young man that jack reeves i-he said to him-
self he turned to the officers

  line your guns on the sky urchin gentlemen he said

                the two men were horrified to see her snatched up from the ground by two strange flying
                creatures that suddenly descended on her the girls scream was drowned by a roar from above
the bat-men of mars

he year was  the planet mars was approach-
ing its closest position to the earth and the two
friends had completed their plans for the most
daring adventure ever known to humanity all
the world had said they were lunatics to attempt
it but that had not in the least deterred them confident of
success they were determined to make the effort the one was
rich enough to make the venture possible and the other was the
outstanding genius of his time

  the fry projectile closely guarded in
its hangar was ready and waiting fitted
out and equipped in minute detail soon it
was to start out on its journey leaving
the realities of earth behind it would fare
forth into the unknown on the first inter-
planetary voyage ever attempted by man

  ten years before leonard fry and
henry randolph had been classmates and
inseparable companions and friends a
spirited discussion in those days had formed
the basis of their present plans both had
been deeply interested in scientific study-
astronomy natural philosophy and biology
holding their deepest attention

  the secret of the universe had always
fascinated them so had the secret of life
but this was nothing new since it had
held mens attention for untold ages

  what would happen fry had asked

if all life on earth were blotted from ex-
istence do you think it would
come again 

  assuredly if the same condi-
tions prevailed replied randolph

  in the same forms

   i believe it would

  then you think evolution is
governed by rules and regula-
tions

  exactly agreed randolph

if similar conditions prevailed
nature could reasonably be ex-
pected to employ the same designs
for which she had already shown
preference

  but i suspect persisted fry

that nature is extremely whimsi-
cal perhaps that is not the best
way to put it let us say that
evolution follows the lines of
least resistance

  then you mean-

  that in the process of evolu-
tion that which once became a
gigantic reptile might just as
easily have become a bird or an
insect or that if nature tried
again she might endow with in-
tellect a creature entirely different
from man

  i dont agree with you said randolph in whom there was
deeply grounded in spite of the depth of his scientific study
the belief tliat there was a supreme intelligence for example
ha went on i should be surprised if forms of life on other
planets differed from what we find right here

  it would be interesting mused fry if one could journey
to other worlds and see what nature had done there
whereupon randolph had laughed at his friends serious
manner

wood jacksob

 rjysobe few terrestrials who are the for-
 j tunate or unfortunate ones to make the
 first interplanetary trip to the moon or the
 other planets are certainly destined to have
 the most remarkable experiences ever en-
 countered by man they will have no real
 knowledge or certainty of the conditions
 they will meet once they set foot on the
 strange world and the chances are just as
 bright that they will be immediately ex-
 terminated by some strange form of life as
 that they will encounter a friendly human
 civilization

   but the chance that they take is no more
 than was taken by those other explorers
 whose names are engraved on our minds-
 byrd peary and others certainly our in-
 terplanetary voyagers will go equipped with
 the best weapons of offense and defense that
 science can provide

   the present story appealed so to the edi-
 tors because its pages rang with the tone of
 truth ur jacksons characters just seem
 to live his adventures are not far-fetched
 and as one goes on through this story he
 begins to feel that he i really taking part
 in a stirring interplanetary drama

 and that opportunity fry declared deliberately might
 actually come some time

 at that randolph had roared and had sworn he would be the
 first to embark on such a voyage if the way could be found
 youd go

 absolutely

 i wonder if you really would 

 just show me and im your man randolph had promised
 and now with dr leonard frys discovery making it ap-
 parently possible he was ready to keep his
 word

 dr fry had astonished the world by re-
 leasing the power of the atom and apply-
 ing its energy he had already dispatched
 a rocket to the moon with atomic power
 and had proved it to the satisfaction of
 other scientists with the largest telescopes
 in america trained upon the lunar surface
 he had landed his rocket which at thtf
 moment of impact had released with a
 burst of atomic energy a dense cloud of
 orange-colored gas orange the comple-
 ment of blue had been easily discernible
 through the blue of the earths dust-filled
 atmosphere

 but dr fry had not revealed the secret
 of his discovery to anyone save ran-
 dolph however as he was not one to
 take too many chances he had carefully
 written the formula of his dis-
 covery and left it in trust at his
 bank it was to be given to the
 world in the event that he and
 randolph did not return toithin
 five years

 the projectile had been built
 at enormous expense the most
 skilled mechanics in the world
 had been employed on its con-
 struction all sworn to secrecy
 then when the great shell was
 finished dr fry had amazed hu-
 manity with its performance it
 was flown around the earth in
 five hours elapsed time scien-
 tists and government representa-
 tives had been on board

 the world flight had been made
 at a slow speed the projectile
 moving at no time faster than
 five thousand miles an hour and
 at an altitude of twenty miles to
 prevent heating from friction
 with the atmosphere observa-
 tion had been possible with a
 powerful telescope that revealed
 flashes of the oceans and conti-
 nents as the craft swept around
 r the globe

 dr fry explained that with the full blast of atomic energy
 loosed for propulsion the outer shell of the projectile would
 heat rapidly in the lower denser strata of atmosphere in fact
 the speed of five thousand miles an hour would closely approach
 that of meteors which become heated to incandescence when
 they enter the earths atmosphere

 provision had been made against such heating by employing
 liquid air for cooling the outer shell powerful compressors
 kept a narrow space between the outer and inner shells filled


air wonder stories

 with the liquid air automatic pressure escapes had been pro-
 vided as well

   the projectile was a graceful streamlined craft some three
hundred feet in length cigar-shaped it had a maximum beam
and depth of thirty feet the magnesium alloy of which it was
constructed was the strongest yet lightest metal developed for
aircraft building

   the craft had a series of rocket tubes for propulsion these
were arranged in various sizes near the stern they were
operated in sets the small ones for a cruising speed that could
be regulated for a minimum of a few miles an hour and the
larger ones firing with great rapidity to provide the maximum
of eleven hundred miles a minute

   and now the long-awaited day had come tonight the two
friends were to set out in an effort to reach mars naturally
the announcement of their plans had caused a stir throughout
the world scientists were not in agreement as to the outcome
of the venture some believed dr fry could take his craft
through space on an interplanetary voyage and return to the
earth others doubted the possibilities of the projectile on such
a stupendous undertaking they sought to dissuade dr fry
whom they regarded as the foremost scientist living and there-
fore a man too valuable to civilization to justify the taking of
such chances

   but fry was obdurate and so was randolph they were
determined to start on the great adventure of which they had
dreamed for years

   entering into the plans of the two men had been a computa-
tion in higher mathematics such as was practiced by the as-
tronomers of the day the projectile moving at terrific speed
had first to be aimed with the greatest precision success de-
pended on angular reckoning dr fry as astronomer physicist
and mathematician was second in this to no man alive re-
peatedly he had gone over his figures and always his findings
had been the same

   both fry and randolph believed the chance for success was
worth the risk and the effort the projectile had been tried and
tested its speed was definitely known fry knew it would es-
cape the atmosphere of the earth and overcome gravitational
pull and then carefully aimed and headed straight for mars
at maximum speed and under gyroscopic control he believed it
would continue without deviation from its course

   the hour for the departure had come streaks of flame
illumined the night sky they were off i the winking lights of
st louis dimmed rapidly as the projectile rose swiftly to the
upper air level its rocket tubes emitting blasts that roared mo-
mentarily and then became hushed to a low drone

   with the delicate instruments he had perfected dr fry aimed
 the shell with the greatest precision at a definite point in the
 heavens he knew that when he got to that place mars would
 have moved there to meet them

chapter ii
rushing through space

as the projectile rushed through space the two men moved
leisurely about for there was nothing for them to do

	in addition the projectile was provided with other sets of tubes
vertically placed beneath the craft to give it the buoyancy desired

no lifting gas was required and there were other sets of tubes
through which atomic energy could be released but these were for
the projectiles protection against possible foes this power was
absolutely blasting in its destructive force a disintegrating weapon
more annihilating than any the world had ever seen

the projectile was provided with ailerons but these were for steer-
ing only in the atmosphere gyroscopic control had been provided to
keep the shell on its course in empty space

in addition since the crafts interior was to be occupied a third
inner shell had been used s a lining powerful pumps maintained
a vacuum between it and the shell that enclosed the liquid air thus
insulation was provided to protect the cooling element against interior
heating for warmth

 the great shell of tough metal found no resistance here it had
 cleared the atmosphere of the earth with sufficient velocity to
 overcome gravitational pull and they were speeding along now
 with the globe rapidly diminishing in size

   absolute zero did not affect them dr fry called randolphs
attention to the thermometer it stood at  degrees fahrenheit
inside the great shell outside the scientist knew it was abso-
lute zero a cold which is not exceeded in all the cosmic scheme

   randolph looked up to find the eyes of his friend upon him
neither showed the slightest concern unlike as two men
could be they yet had in common the dauntless spirit of adven-
ture they had realized of course that they dared oblivion
but what matter it was the great adventure i times had
changed with the advancement of science and they had risen
equal to the occasion they were men to dare oblivion eager
for the chance

   satisfied leonard asked randolph his tone indicating
that he knew what the answer would be

   perfectly

  and so am i

  dr leonard fry was a man a little above medium height
and of compact athletic build randolph who knew him well
believed he had  nerves no fear of anything in existence the
scientists gray eyes were dear and steady as he looked into the
void through which they were rushing his high wide forehead
from which his dark hair swept back showed no lines of worry
his sensitive mouth reflected a smile of confidence and his color
was heightened by the thrill of the adventure he had dared he
reclined in an easy chair apparently as comfortable as if he
had sat in his apartment discussing plans with his friend

   here thought randolph was concentrated the ultimate of
human force in this one man who at thirty-five easily led the
scientific world everything about him suggested power mental
resource courage daring will his confidence in himself as
randolph knew was so limitless that he might have been con-
sidered the foremost egotist alive but his friend had long ago
found denial of this in the fact that leonard fry had always
succeeded there lay the proof that he knew and knew tliat
he knew

   you have no regrets randolph old fellow fry was turn-
ing the pages of a book randolph noted that his friends grace-
ful but powerful hands were as steady as a mans could be
there was no nervousness here

  none answered randolph and if i had- he merely
waved his hand toward the projectiles stern to indicate his
complete dismissal of what they had left behind them

randolph was the younger by two years and a man of
great size six feet four inches in height and weighing
nearly two hundred and fifty pounds he yet appeared slender
so symmetrical were his proportions and so graceful his car-
riage he was a flaxen-haired square-jawed big-boned elemen-
tal man descendant of explorers adventurers and pioneers
through many generations behind him had been conquests of
such importance that long before dr fry had discovered the
secret of atomic power he was regarded throughout america
as a dominating force in business

   henry randolph was every inch a commander a natural born
master of men and situations in business he had occupied a
place equal to that won by his friend in the scientific world he
was a practical and hard-headed man but withal he was a
dreamer and an adventurer too a man in whom the extremes
of fact and fancy met and were bound together

  long since these two men had discovered and appreciated
the strength of the appeal each made to the other their na-
tures were so to speak synchronized attuned with such a close
approach to perfection that what one lacked the other supplied
they were not alike indeed they were strong in contrast in all
except the quality of determination each possessed in about
the bat-men of mars



equal degree

  with escape now woo from the earth the adventurers real-
ized that a long wait lay ahead of them with almost nothing to
do the projectile would go on and on of its own motion for
days and weeks through the thirty-five million miles that sepa-
rated it from its objective

  there was no work of any kind to be done the great shell
was automatically controlled and only a glance at the course
indicators every few hours was necessary to make sure that
tliey were on their chosen path

  the two men sat in the observatory enjoying the thrill of
their adventure highly entertained for they had been given
a privilege no human beings before them had enjoyed they were
yet awed by what they beheld

  the sun of course was in eclipse the great bulk of the
earth lying directly between them and the flaming orb so
there was no sleep for them for they both wished to see tbe
sunrise upon the earth which fry knew would come soon

  dr fry pointed out the planets to his friend there was
mars to the right of the projectile its steady glow holding
their attention as well it might since it remained to be seen
whether the planet was ever to be their destination mean-
while from every direction as they plunged into space there
flamed the constellations the heavens were literally studded
with stars that glittered as diamonds set against a background
of velvet black

  then at last the adventurers were rewarded with the sunrise
upon the earth from which they were hurtling at a velocity
of more than one and one-half million miles a day but what
they saw was merely a flaming orb the glare of a great star
shining from a dead black sky for here there was no dust-
fillcd atmosphere to create the illusion of blue and to obscure
their vision

  stars showed in every direction undimmed by the glare from
the sun outside of the projectile there was darkness it was
only inside the great shell where an atmosphere obtained that
the rays of the sun were diffused into daylight and hanging
there in space as the adventurers gazed back was the world
tliey had left its seas reflecting the bright sunlight and its land
contours showing ragged and irregular as faint dark markings

  as the two men looked out into space and beheld the sun
they were protected from its glare by specially constructed
windows these were built of cylindrical filaments for strength
against the interior pressure and colored according to the scien-
tists own carefully prepared formula

  and out there randolph said fry it is absolute zero if
we opened the windows wed soon be icicles in every tissue

  i hope said randolph that the glass holds

  well rather said the other but i am sure it will there
is no resistance at all from without and that from within is not
strong enough to affect it

oxygen tanks under terrific compression supplied them
with air everything had been provided for their comfort
and convenience the projectiles interior was commodious its
quarters extensive there were vast store-rooms where food
supplies were carried also there were a gymnasium a loung-
ing-room and five sleeping chambers in addition to the large
observatory near the stern

  port-holes now closed and securely fastened could be opened
from a lower deck here had been stored their weapons of
defense machine guns light and heavy rifles and vast quantities
of ammunition there were also ports now dosed into which
two sets of heavy landing trucks had been drawn as the pro-
jectile left the earth on its journey into space

  forward was the power laboratory it had been built into the
shell with great care taken for its protection it was placed on
a middle deck and there were protecting walls on either side
but a system had been installed with which the craft could be

operated from any part of the interior its propulsion its steer-
ing when there was atmosphere its defense tubes everything in
fact in the way of manipulation was ready at liand wherever
dr fry might be

  on and on through space at terrific velocity sped the pro-
jectile the two men inside it sat in contemplation of the
glories all about them but as time wore on and their watches
showed the breakfast hour they thought of food

  randolph made the colfee and broiled the bacon while dr
fry toasted the bread a rich golden brown eggs shirred in an
electric oven and crcam fresh and sweet from a generous supply
in the refrigerator room whetted their already keen appetites

  as fry buttered the toast and randolph poured the coffee
both eagerly antidpating their first breakfast in space there
came to them distinctly as though close at hand a human voice

  gentlemen it said have you some for me i am nearly
starved i

  just an instant the two men looked at each other wondering
if they had heard the same tiling then tliey turned in the
direction of the voice there stood alicia rowan frys fiancee
in the doorway of what tliey had believed to be an unoccupied
sleeping compartment i

chapter iii
adventurers three

the reaction of both men was as though a ghost had sud-
denly appeared i they were first startled and then dumb-
founded for they had bdieved themselves alone as they
sped through space they had taken precautions to prevent a
coup of this kind from some ambitious journalist the door of
the hangar had been securely locked and that was how they
found it besides there were only two keys that would unlock
it-as they had believed

  however the vision of loveliness standing before them was
proof enough that the girl in the flesh was in the great shell
with them bound like themselves for the unexplored realms of
space

  in amazed silence the two men regarded the golden-haired
blue-eyed girl who stood there in the doorway smiling bravely
but somewhat doubtingly as her question remained unanswered

  do i look like a ghost  she inquired laughingly breaking
the spell

  and now fry spoke for the first time alicia he demanded
how on earth did you manage it

  he remembered she had begged him to take her but he had
not dreamed that she would attempt this

  leonard she replied tremulously although she smiled hap-
pily i simply couldnt let you go without me after you told
me good-by i slipped out the back way where my car was
waiting and i drove ahead of you to the hangar there i let
myself in with a duplicate key i have carried for weeks i got
a wax impression of your own key and here i am isnt it all
perfectly thrilling

  so you stowed away eh said fry wryly

  yes i had meant to do it all along

  but this may mean the end alicia he warned

  i know she agreed looking into his eyes unafraid but
if it is i shant be down there waiting and longing for you

  the girl now sought to look deeper into her lovers eyes
a tender smile lit her face but her expression was still one of
uncertainty

  are you angry with me leonard she asked simply

  no bless your heart but i shall worry about you

  oh please dont i

  but theres no telling what we may encounter said the
man we are daring the unknown-another world-perhaps
strange beings or terrible forces ahead lies myystery-we have
left the real world behind i


air wonder stories

  i understand perfectly leonard the girl admitted but
there can be only one end for any of us no terrors that come
can harm me more than they can hurt you

  randolph lightened the tension with a laugh

  anyway leonard he said with finality the stowaway
cant be put off or taken back she seems to have everything
her own way

  oh absolutely said dr fry and now alicia you con-
fessed an appetite lets eat and drink and be merry for to-
morrow we may-

  leonard i cried the girld for shame i this venture is
to succeed  simply wont have you fail i

  but we are not supermen he protested

  you are she insisted and the whole world knows it i

  and that might not couni up here he retorted but tell
me he went on will you promise not to fall in love with some
handsome martian and let me go back without you

the girl merely looked at him the light of enduring love
in her eyes but a twisted little smile on her lips betrayed
he thought her anticipation of a somewhat belated breakfast
this was verified the next moment as she seated herself at the
table and eagerly took the cup of coffee he poured for her

  breakfast over alicia told how she had carried out her plan
to board the projectile her duplicate key had enabled her to
make elaborate plans for the venture she had made many
secret trips to the hangar with her belongings she had out-
fitted as completely as they had proudly she showed them the
costumes she had brought outdoor apparel predominated but
there were pretty frocks too

  by jove i exclaimed randolph teasingly our pretty little
stowaway is expecting to get into the martian social register
sure as shooting i

  a shadow passed over the scientists face

  im hoping that the martian  will not try to annihilate
us he confessed

  randolph looked up surprised from the first he had trusted
his friend to the uttermost limit of human powers he had
implicitly believed dr fry could do anything

  but leonard we are prepared for anything that happens
he argued

  i think we are said fry slowly but you must remember
that the martians might be a good deal older than we are and
have a higher civilization it is possible that we are pygmies in
power and skill and mind compared to them that is to be
considered

  even then declared alicia bravely loyal i feel that you
are superior to them whatever they may be and whatever they
may do

  dr frys countenance betrayed his misgivings which existed
only because of alicias presence on the projectile there must
be no turning back he knew that was impossible for it would
mean defeat so whatever the projectiles destination might
be there alicia would be bound to accompany him and randolph
meanwhile he could but hope for her safety and do all in his
power to protect her

  the girl sensed the anxiety that her lover did not voice and
she knew it was because of her passionately in love with him
as her presence in the projectile eloquently attested she now
sought to dispel any worry for which she had been responsible

  apart from her natural beauty alicias greatest charm was
in her direct speech which she made most engaging she now
aroused randolphs admiration anew and diminished in a degree
frys perplexity by the manner in which she sought to approach
a better understanding of their situation

  now leonard she began i want you to quit worrying
about me you must know its far better as it is than if i were
down there alone and you were going into the unknown per-
haps never to return oh we live and love for such a little

space of time and i care too much for happiness to risk it all
by staying on one world while you go adventuring to another 

  i confess that i loved you too deeply for that leonard she
went on and randolph listened in perfect sympathy for here
he thought was such a woman as is found but rarely so i
came oh leonard how glad i am in every part of me i she
cried i should have been unwilling to miss any of it the
glory of the beautiful wonderful terrible sun the thrill of the
adventure and companionship with you-all these were lure
enough dear and you cant blame me i now wont you forgive
me for what i did just because i loved you so

  why alicia responded her lover as moved to tenderness
by her appeal he embraced her endearingly you havent a
thing to worry about and youve nothing to fear so long as we
have strength to defend you

  but i dont mean that at all i she declared i want you to
feel that i am not going to be in the way a hindrance an en-
cumbrance but rather a help this is your great and wonder-
ful adventure yours and his i wouldnt have you fail for life
itself now wont you let me help she begged wont you
let me share your risks the same as your triumphs when you
have succeeded

randolph was nodding and smiling his approval as she
talked but he said nothing for although she had included
him in at least a part of her appeal he knew it was a matter
between them alone

  presently fry permitted the ghost of a smile to escape him
then his eye brightened and his countenance cleared alicia
was encouraged

  and now promise youll quit worrying about me she
pleaded turning her beautiful eyes full upon them

  oh but  havent been worrying protested randolph
smiling encouragement

  and i shant-any more i promise you declared fry
warmly why im rather glad really that youre here little
girl i

  really leonard i she cried

  yes and henceforth we are adventurers three and whatever
comes we shall face it together and you i think he praised
are the bravest of us all he kissed her tenderly

  the girls face was now radiant she had been accepted as
a comrade and partner by the two most daring and picturesque
men of her time on what she made sure was up to the moment
lifes greatest adventure and undertaking

chapter iv

watching side by side

no attempt had been made to communicate with the earth
until escape had been won from the envelope of atmos-
phere surrounding the globe dr fry steadfastly had
believed it would be possible to transmit and receive messages
through space so now he sent messages advising that all was
well on the projectile but refrained from mentioning alicias
presence

  the scientist was puzzled at receiving no replies from the
earth the projectile had been equipped with a high-powered
station with improvements designed for transmission through
the ether of outer space but nothing came he was disappointed

  a failure in that respect he observed

  but perhaps the messages are being received on earth
suggested randolph

  i doubt it returned the other the station in st louis
has the same improvements we are using if our messages get
through the replies would come

  the effort was repeated daily during the week that followed
but no messages came it was as though the three adventurers
were cut off from everybody and everything had become living
the bat-men of mars



flotsam and jetsam in a cosmic sea and the outcome of their
brave adventure on it was at best uncertain

 alicias presence proved a veritable godsend as the days
 passed for there was a monotony that would have been intoler-
 able but for her bright presence and her gay light humor she
 had taken charge of the elaborate and beautifully appointed
 kitchen and had been much amused to see the worlds foremost
 scientist washing dishes and a multimillionaire peeling potatoes
 or doing whatever she asked she called them her kitchen
 police

 but the days passed slowly for all it seemed so eager were
 they to reach their destination mars increased in brilliancy as
 the distance between it and the projectile was shortened and the
 earth from which they were speeding became but a disc
 shining like a jewel against its background of black sky

 dr fry took careful observations from time to time he was
 glad to sec at frequent intervals that they were holding on their
 plotted course

 i dont sec how we can possibly miss it he told his com-
 panions

 well ive been betting from the first wed get there said
 randolph

 and i too said alicia with enthusiasm and im wonder-
 ing if the martians have good roads and motor cars and oh
 yes a decent cafe i admit im a little tired of my own dishes

 dr fry although he confessed no misgivings was less con-
 fident than they

 i have hoped for the best you may be sure he told them
 but we cant possibly foresee what may await us there-pro-
 vided always of course that we hit the target at which we
 aimed and the martians even if intelligent creatures may
 not be human beings at all and therefore he warned they
 might be terribly unreasonable

 and im betting on tliat too declared randolph i still
 insist as i used to that we shall find human beings like our-
 selves

 thats right agreed the scientist turning to alicia he
 has had a bug on that since he was a boy at school

 again and again dr fry took observations and checked his
 figures for direction the projectile had been wholly under
 gyroscopic control and the calculations of the scientist showed
 the craft was definitely nearing the planet for which it had
 been aimed

 mars however was still a long way off some twelve to fifteen
 million miles and a miss of a few thousand miles would be
 as fatal as if the distance were multiplied by itself henceforth
 dr fry planned to keep a more constant watch of the planet
 and to take more frequent observations if there were errors
 the sooner he discovered them the better

 with painstaking care fry also kept track of the time he
 was going now by what might be called dead reckoning so far
 as the distance covered in a given time was concerned he
 had every reason to believe that the projectile was moving
 through space with a velocity of eleven hundred miles a minute
 more than one and one-half million miles every twenty-four
 hours

 the scientist seemed to the others to be on watch almost con-
 stantly rarely was he anywhere but in the observatory busy
 with his instruments he was forever making calculations in
 the higher mathematics which they did not understand

 larger and larger as they swept through space appeared
 the mass they were studying it also became more distinct to
 the naked eye its outline could now be seen long since how-
 ever they had trained a powerful telescope upon it bring into
 strong relief the familiar markings on its surface

 both alicia and randolph felt sure that the projectiles
 arrival on the planet was now only a matter of a few days

 but fry was not so sure again and again he took observa-
 tions and worked out his calculations at length when the mass

 toward which they were rushing loomed large to the naked eye
 he discovered for the first time that the projectile seemed des-
 tined to pass the planets orbit too soon accordingly he decided
 that the time had come to gradually reduce their speed until
 they could depend wholly upon the planets gravitational pull

   on sped the projectile with the planet looming larger hour
 by hour and now the scientist was tense and expectant as he
 devoted himself to his observations at last he sighed with
 relief as the others watched he had determined beyond a doubt
 that the nose of the great shell was bearing gradually to the
 right

   a few days more and dr fry was as a man transformed
 now he knew that gravitational pull had changed the course of
 the projectile and that it was headed straight for the planet

   it was an excited trio that now gazed at mars and awaited
 the time when the projectile should enter the planets atmos-
 phere all thought of food and rest had passed from their
 minds side by side the adventurers watched the crucial mo-
 ment was near at hand

   dr fry had known that the atmospheric pressure on mars
 was not so great as that on earth so he had perfected and em-
 ployed a plan whereby those on board the projectile could be-
 come accustomed gradually to the change day after day for
 three weeks the pressure of atmosphere within the shell had
 been gradually lessened until now it was believed to approxi-
 mate that of the planet they were about to enter

   swiftly the mass of the red planet mars grew in size it
 seemed rushing to meet them gravitational pull had obviously
 increased the velocity of the projectile

   now the planets pull was so great that the plane of their
 flight became perceptibly changed that is to say it was
 approaching the perpendicular they realized this when the deck
 of the craft began to incline they were shooting downward
 more and more

   meanwhile fry was tensely watching his instruments a
 gauge now indicated atmospheric pressure from outside the
 projectile then the scientist released forward rockets of atomic
 power to decelerate the velocity of the shell it responded
 gratifyingly and now the controls were brought into use with
 the craft leveled out and slowing to a cruising speed in the
 upper air strata

   the projectile passed over extensive areas far below but the
 details could not yet be brought into view with even their
 strongest glasses the craft was dropping gently to a lower
 level

   dr fry naturally daring in most things was determined now
 to proceed with the greatest caution once more he theorized
 in explanation of his plan

   it is generally believed he told his companions that
 animate life on mars is older than that on the earth it is
 therefore reasonable to suppose that if the planet is inhabited
 by intelligent creatures they are far in advance of ourselves
 eventually of course our presence on the planet will be dis-
 covered indeed we should desire tliat but it should be under
 circumstances favorable to us if possible

   they were still at a high level and were using their power-
 ful glasses for observations they discovered there was water
 but less of it in proportion to the land areas than was the case
 on the earth what appeared to be vast dry ocean beds were
 seen stretching for great distances far beneath them also
 there were lines criss crossing wide expanses of terrain and dr
 fry was delighted to find his theory regarding hem was
 proved they were after all canals

   alicia and randolph were impatient to land but fry did not
 share their eagerness he felt tliat so far as the unknown
 element in their adventure was concerned the greatest perils for
 himself and his companions might still lie ahead

   at length however they picked out a landing place and
 slowly descended to the surface of mars


air wonder stories

and now it was as though fate herself had decided that the
projectile should land at a most inopportune time and in a re-
gion extremely dangerous hardly could the adventurers have
chosen a less auspicious spot had they landed elsewhere than
in the great craters of dir they would not have come in con-
tact with the hairy bat-men who lived in an isolation as com-
plete as if they inhabited another planet

chapter v

the attack of the bat-men

oth alicia and randolph were enthusiastic as the pro-
jectile was lowered gently to the ground

im so tired confessed the girl my feet are just
ching and this turf looks wonderful to me

bhe had attired herself in knickers and stout boots an
amomatic hung from her belt and she carried a light but high-
powered rifle the two men armed themselves with heavy au-
tomatics and each carried a repeating rifle

 eagerly the trio stepped forth upon a verdant plain for their
 first contact with a world other than their own

there was not a sign of life revealed as the adventurers
swept the surrounding country for miles with their powerful
glasses no bird nor beast was perceived although it was ap-
parent when they opened the door of the projectile that the
atmosphere and its temperature were sufficient to support life
it was evidently midsummer in the latitude where they had
landed the plain on which the great shell rested was a roll-
ing prairie covered with a heavy growth of grasses there
were flowers too which alicia attempted to classify without
much success

but as no animate life was seen after reconnoitering for a
radius of some hundreds of yards from the projectile they
returned to the craft for luncheon

dr fry emphatically vetoed alicias suggestion for an out-
door picnic

we mustnt think of such a thing he declared and ran-
dolph agreed with him

although there was apparently nothing to fear it was dr
frys conclusion that until more was known about their
new and strange environment it would be far safer to stick close
to the projectile in which they could defend themselves from
possible attack by retaliation or by flight however neither
man demurred when alicia announced she would go out and
pick some flowers for the luncheon table

randolph from the observatory surveyed the plain on all
sides before the girl set out but he did not think to look
overhead

alicia had not gone more than fifty yards from the pro-
jectile when the two men standing at an open window were
horrified at seeing her snatched up from the ground by two
strange flying creatures that suddenly descended upon her the
girls scream was drowned by a roar from above as hundreds
of strange flying beasts hurled themselves upon the projectile

the window at which the two men had stood was the only
one open randolph had sufficient presence of mind to close it
quickly and restrain fry from leaping out in a futile attempt
at the girls rescue

the scientist was suddenly frantic he had seen his sweet-
heart lifted from the ground and borne swiftly up and away
but now he and randolph were forced by the onslaught from
the flying men to considercieans of saving themselves and
the craft for any attempt at alicias rescue must depend upon
their survival

randolph a natural fighter manned a machine gun and
sprayed flapping swarms of the bat-like men they fell like
leaves in a storm but more came the air seemed to be
literally filled with them they could be heard on the roof
of the projectile clawing at the metal of the shell in vain at-
tempts to gain entrance

   fry was like a madman he leapt to the controls that directed
 the blasting destructive force of atomic power randolph
 screamed a warning just in time

  for gods sake fry he yelled above the rattle of his
machine gun dont do that i we dont know where alicia is
you might destroy her too

the scientist paled as he realized the danger he went to
another port on the opposite side of the craft and got a
machine gun into action killing in a fury and yelling like a
savage as he saw the hairy shapes of the flying creatures tumble
to the ground torn and bleeding

  these beasts were to live long in the memory of the two
human beings who fought them and slew them in great numbers
the creatures had no weapons but it cotild not be doubted that
in a hand to hand encounter they would be formidable sug-
gesting the gorilla somewhat in facial features the bat-men
were covered with rough coarse hair from head to foot with
powerful torsos and slender legs they suggested the bat for
stretched along their thick heavy arms were membranes that
enabled them to fly with great rapidity in size they were
larger than human beings

  never had either man seen such demonstrations of ferocity
the bat-men hurled themselves constantly upon the craft they
climbed over it peering through the windows and grimacing
horribly

  the slaughter continued till it sickened the two men who had
been responsible for the piles of dead creatures surrounding the
shell

  great heavens randolph cried fry at last what are we
going to do were getting nowhere i suggest something 
weve got to save her

   but thats impossible so long as these beasts are attacking
 replied randolph spraying the bat-men with death the while

  i have it i exclaimed the scientist well ascend that
surely will get rid of them

  dr fry set the rockets going and the projectile arose the
bat-men continued to besiege the craft tearing at the metal
roof it was observed however that none of the creatures
followed the projectile on wing fry in spite of his excitement
and anxiety attributed this to the rarefied atmosphere which
forced them to fly at lower levels

  the projectile climbed rapidly yet the bat-men on the roof
continued to beat upon it with their great hairy hands now
fry reasoned that an even higher altitude would produce the
desired effect

  at a higher level it was seen that many of the bat-men leapt
from the projectile with membranes closed and dived for the
warmer regions below the hardier ones hung on for a time
but at last all of them had leapt into space to escape the bitter
cold

  the projectile was now halted and allowed to drift in the
upper air the two men held council together

  our only hope of course said randolph is the plane
lets assemble it as quickly as possible

  there was a deck on the roof of the projectile from which
to take off in the airplane snugly stowed under trap-doors open-
ing into the runway in half an hour the men had the light
craft ready for flight both were skilled pilots and the plane
was armed with a machine gun

   the projectile was brought under such control with its rocket
 power set at slow speed and its steering gear locked in position
 as would cause it to soar slowly around mars in circuitous
 flight at a high level they could return to it in the plane at
 any time whereas it was beyond the reach of the bat-men
 because of its height

   randolph took the pilots seat in the plane at his companions
 suggestion dr fry manned the machine gun

  the plane cruised swiftly here and there darting over the
the bat-men of mars



plain at a low level searching for alicia and her captors
there below it lay the huddled masses of dead bat-men but
nowhere was there a sign of life of any kind the surviving
bat-men had disappeared as completely as though they had
deserted the craters

chapter vi
an elemental combat

y licia surprised by the sudden assaurt had been too ter-

r rifled to think of using the automatic still in the holster
 at her belt although she had seen the dreadful shapes
in time to have accounted for at least one but the next
moment it was impossible she had been lifted from the
ground with a bat-man on either side cruelly clutching her arms

    alicia was a girl of courage but the horror of her plight was
 too great what with the nearness of the repulsive creatures
 and the pain their talons inflicted and she swooned as she was
 borne over the plain at last she opened her eyes and found
 herself in the presence of the two monsters which squatting
 on their haunches were looking at her

    pretending to swoon again she closed her eyes shutting the
loathsome beasts from her vision meanwhile she took inven-
tory of herself she had suffered nothing apparently she
was unhurt although her arm were sore where her captors
talons had gripped them

    as though in sleep the girl rolled over on her side moving
her right hand as she did so and touched the automatic then
she lay still nothing happened

    now she stole a glance at the bat-men through half-opened
lids they had not moved but she saw them grimacing at
each other then one lifted his great hairy arm with its blue-
black membrane closed and waved a gnarled thing of a hand
at her fascinated she observed the creatures studying them
and wondering if she might have a chance to escape

    the bat-men for the moment did not appear to be so inter-
ested in her as in each other the one that had made the
gesture snarled in a guttural tone at which the other bared his
powerful teeth alicia did not know that at that moment they
were disputing the matter of her proprietorship

    the girl and the bat-men were inside what appeared to be a
grotto at least she could see that it was a kind of enclosure
light streamed through broken shapeless openings in the wall
that extended upward some seven or eight feet

    alicia moved her hand gently over the ground on which she
lay it was smooth in slight undulations she guessed it to
be stone or perhaps lava for she remembered that the pro-
jectile had descended into what obviously was a gigantic crater

    but the bat-men held her attention the controversy between
them was increasing fiercer and fiercer grew the snarling of
the creatures which seemed quite to have forgotten her

    the one nearer to alicia suddenly leaped upon the other in
a furious attack uttering a roar that startled her into a sitting
posture all at once the two beasts were struggling on the
floor of the grotto snarling horribly and rending each other
with tooth and talon

alicia was in a panic of fear and horror for now she knew
intuitively that the conflict was because of her the realiza-
tion was sickening but spellbound she witnessed the struggle
praying that the creatures might destroy each other thus per-
mitting her to escape

the girl backed deeper into the grotto as the fighting bat-
men milled around in a circle foam flying from their distended
lips and blood streaming from their wounds never had she
witnessed anything like this atavistic struggle the din of the
beasts roars in the close confines of the grotto was deafening
meanwhile the girl was nauseated by a musklike stench that
rose from the creatures writhing bodies

she wondered as the beasts fought whether she might
escape their notice and edge around to the opening used

as an entrance she determined to attempt it

  moving with the utmost caution in the hope of attracting no
attention to herself she edged closer to the opening one hand
feeling the way along the lava wall and the other gripping her
automatic not once however did she take her eyes off the
brutes who were tearing at each other in what was evidently
a fight to the death

  alicia gained the opening and stopping slightly backed out
of it as the two creatures fell to the floor writhing in their
agony and fury and then with the sunlight upon her and
the sweet fresh air in her nostrils she turned from the grotto
and fled her automatic ready at hand

  she ran at first blindly choosing no course but she soon
observed that she was running parallel to a long tier of grottoes
so she turned sharply away from the habitations of the bat-
men and courageously struck out for the open plain

  alicia as she ran looked for the projectile but without
seeing it her captors no doubt had taken her a long distance
she reasoned continuing her frenzied flight she could not
know that at that moment her friends were still struggling
with the hairy hordes that had attacked them

  exhausted by her efforts and her terrible experience alicia
at last fell headlong in the soft heavy grass and lay panting
in a dazed condition of mind she had put more than a mile
between herself and the grotto from which she had escaped

  the girl lay flat on her back arms and legs extended in
almost complete exhaustion dimly she was conscious that she
was looking up at the pale sky in which no cloud appeared
beneath her the soft cool grass was as a bed before she
realized it alicia grew drowsy it was with the greatest effort
that she was able to keep awake in spite of herself her eyes
closed but she did not sleep she meant to lie there and rest
awhile    then to struggle on    away from the horrible
grottoes of the bat-men

  alicia thought when she opened her eyes that she saw a
speck in the sky and it seemed to her too that she could
hear the faint distant drone of a motor but that was not
possible of course but yes it was possible she reasoned she
knew of the plane carried on the projectile perhaps leonard
and randolph were out searching for her and were using the
plane instead of the projectile

  earnestly scanning the heavens she could see nothing but the
idea persisted that she could hear a humming noise as of a
motor it was distant and faint and irregular in that it came
and went then at last she told herself it was fancy so she
closed her eyes again resting

  as the girls strength returned her faculties grew more alert
she tried to think what might happen what course the two
men might pursue in an effort to rescue her she prayed that
they had not been overwhelmed by the bat-men but had been
able to fight them off then she remembered the open window
and feared the worst randolph himself powerful as she knew
him to be would still be no match for one of the bat-men nor
could their weapons save them once the creatures gained en-
trance to the projectile

  if still alive she knew her friends would do everything in
their power to reach her and while at times she doubted that
they had survived she continued to hope and pray for their
safety

  now the drone of a motor again came to her straining cars
and it seemed to be closer it was more distinct than it had
been also it was continuous alicia sat up suddenly looking
overhead

  then as she half reclined on the grass with her elbow on the
ground she saw it there it was a sort of airplane and it was
rapidly descending she watched its approach never doubting
it was her friends from the projectile but in a little while she
saw that that was impossible for the approaching plane was
unlike anything she had ever seen i


air wonder stories

  a minute and it was settling lightly to the ground near her
its engine stilled and its graceful amber-colored wings reflected
the sunlight as though the plane were a gigantic insect halted
for a moment in its flight

               chapter vii
               licias rescue

what alicia now saw presented such a contrast to her
past experiences that for a moment she was unnerved
she had just fled from the most horrible creatures it
had ever been her misfortune to behold and now approaching
her was one of the most magnificent human beings she had ever
dreamed of existing he was a strong stalwart young man
could he be a martian

  alicia tried to arise but her exertions already had been great
and she fell back weakly she turned her head however and
kept her eyes fixed upon the man who had left his plane and
was running swiftly toward her another moment and he had
knelt on the ground beside her deep wonderment showing in his
eyes as he scanned her face

  for only a moment did the man bend over her while she
smiled up at him now confident of safety then he was sud-
denly alert as though in alarm picking her up bodily he ran
to his craft the engine of which he started immediately the
machine rose vertically and at great speed just in time to escape
the rush of a dozen or more bat-men that flapped in fury
below them ascending to a greater height her rescuer cleared
the walls of the crater to take a direct course at great speed

  as they flew alicia studied her companion he had addressed
a few words to her but as she shook her head a puzzled look
had come into his eyes

  now and then the man would look at her searchingly address-
ing her again and again in a futile effort at communication
but it was no use she could understand nothing of what he
said

  meanwhile alicia wondered how she could let her rescuer
know of the plight of her friends she knew that jf they had
survived they would continue their efforts to free her from the
bat-men and that great danger threatened them as long as
they did not know that she was no longer held captive how to
get a message to them was now her greatest concern as to her
rescuer she felt perfectly safe with him young handsome and
as virile a type of manhood as she had ever seen he obviously
was the product of a highly-developed civilization

  they flew on for about two hours and then descended as they
approached a strange city alicia gazed in wonder at the beauty
of the scene before her she had already concluded there was
a high culture on the planet her contact with the stalwart
fellow who had so opportunely saved her had verified it

  the city before the girls wondering eyes lay nestled in a
narrow valley guarded by high rugged mountains that boldly
thrust upward and reflected iridescent colors in the bright sun-
light they were still too far away for her to make anything
of the architecture so the first impression alicia had was a
riot of gay color like a jewel in a rough picturesque setting
lay the city its buildings a variety of shades that shone in the
distance with a pleasing harmony of design

they landed on a runway in the grounds of an imposing
structure standing on an eminence overlooking the city
the girls companion escorted her into the building where
within a few minutes alicia found herself the center of a group
of men who regarded her with the utmost courtesy and cere-
mony but with a curiosity they failed to conceal

  one after another addressed her she could only shake her
head and smile finally they ceased questioning her and con-
versed together meanwhile her escort younger than the
others and apparently pleased with his achievement in bringing

here hithfr smilingly stood near as though to reassure her

  there were eight or ten men in the group all of them were
somewhat distinguished in appearance and in fact they impressed
alicia as being of scholarly type their manner she observed
was dignified and even profound the girl felt tliat she had
been brought to an institution of some kind and this speculation
was supported a few minutes later when she was taken to a
large hall used as an observatory instruments were to be seen
here and there in orderly array the girl caught sight of a
gigantic telescope at the end of the hall she also saw a
planetarium at a distance while from the smooth marble walls
hung charts of many sizes

  one of the group an elderly stately man of great dignity
and gracious bearing turned to his companions and made a
suggestion alicia of course did not understand yet she sensed
at once the effect of the old mans words on the others she
noted that their attitude changed instantly their thoughtfulness
giving way to a wonderment in which it was evident there was
mixed a great deal of excitement and she was certain that
what he had said concerned her

  the white-haired patriarch whom the others had addressed
as horo now beckoned to alicia she stepped forward and he
led her to a corner of the great hall before them was a
planetarium an instrument with which she was familiar al-
though she had never before seen the solar system so beauti-
fully presented in miniature it plainly was a work of art
attesting at once the high mechanical skill and scientific knowl-
edge here

  horo took a slender rod and touched the sun of the planetar-
ium glancing inquiringly at alicia

  the girl nodded that she understood

  next horo touched the fourth planet from the sun which
she knew to be mars then he bowed to her and placed his
hands on his breast after a wide sweeping gesture with his
outspread arms

  alicia knew just what he meant and so indicated with a
smile

  now horo offered her the rod which she took and at once
indicated the third planet from the sun which was the earth
her own world then she bowed to the group with her hands
on her heart

  amazement spread over the faces of all and horo who had
been the first to conceive the idea that she must be from another
world was in ecstasy because of his discovery eagerly he
grasped alicia by the hand again and led her to a chart  the
wall swiftly he turned the sheets over till it was her turn to
show amazement for horo now exposed a projection of the
earths surface that actually showed the continents with a
fidelity of outline that amazed her	

  here indeed was a skill in astronomy that was marvflous i
certainly she conjectured leonard fry would be entranced
with it and now she gave thought anew to the problem that
had been constantly in her mind but for which she had found
no solution

  she looked about her for the one medium with which she
might be able to express herself presently she found what she
sought and now with parchment of a fine texture and a crayon
in her hands she became the center of interest

  rapidly she sketched the projectile in flight between the two
planets not a word was spoken by anyone but the martians
all hung over her shoulder in astonishment she showed her
two companions of the journey

now she pictured herself leaving the projectile and gather-
ing flowers in the crater where they had landed while
her friends remained on board next there was a sketch of
herself being borne away by the horrible bat-men everyone
shuddered as she looked up after picturing the grotto to which
she had been carried and her escape and rescue
the bat-men of mars



  alicia now turned to see her handsom rescuer standing a
little in the rear she welcomed him with a smile and advanced
to take his hand and thank him with her eyes the handsome
martian bent low in a graceful gesture of acknowledgment

  so now the martians knew what she had been longing to tell
them she hoped they could do something to relieve the situa-
tion which she knew was desperate and would remain so until
her friends could be appraised of her safety and whereabouts

  horo evidently the leader of the group smiled and conducted
her to another room of the extensive building the room held
many glittering instruments some of which seemed familiar

  horo led her directly to a contrivance which she guessed
was a transmitter of some kind the martian touched a switch
and spoke directly into the instrument then he invited her to
do likewise

  hopefully-for she had no way of knowing for certain that
it was a kind of radio microphone-she stood before the instru-
ment and spoke into it
lebnard i she called can you hear me  this is alicia i
she waited a few moments and repeated it

  the thought ran through her mind that her friends might
not be in the projectile at the time perhaps they were even
now scouting in the plane or engaged in combat with the bat-
men in the crater

  once more she called wondering whether this instrument she
was using could be employed as a medium to communicate with
one constructed on another world she did not know that the
silent martians beside her were not worrying about that for
they had long ago developed a method for use in such emer-
gencies as a matter of fact it was accomplished by mani-
folding the message itself which was actually transmitted over
various wavelengths and could thus be heard by any receiving
set in operation on the planet
there was no reply but she called again

  and now the entire group was electrified as the answer came
from a large amplifier

  thank god i alicia  said the voice where arc you  it
was fry speaking

  safe with friends dear alicia replied arc you safe all
right

  both of us yes i came the answer and youre with
friends you say what does that mean 

  i was rescued by a martian aviator after escaping from
those horrid beasts she explained and i am safe and sound
in a city about two hours flight from the crater but i dont
know what the direction is and i cant communicate with these
people but i am perfectly safe with them what do you
suggest

  well if a flier came out we could easily follow him in
that ought to be easy you know

  yes of course the girl agreed and ill try to make them
understand stay near the crater and surely ill find a way to
reach you ill come too leonard dear

  but alicia did not know that this permission would be with-
held from her and that by direct order of the kor of osin in
the capital city of hio to which she had come she would be held
virtually a prisoner

chapter viii
the projectiles arrival

the great shell was being held directly over the craters
at a height too great for the bat-men to reach and there
fry and randolph waited both were tremendously in-
terested in the developments that had come so suddenly after
their heartbreaking efforts to find alicia

  they had feared the worst that the girl had been destroyed
by the bat-men repeatedly they had flown in the plane to
every point in the scries of craters but the vigilance of the bat-

men now thoroughly aroused had prevented them from making
a thorough search landing had been quite impossible and
they feared to employ the atomic power of the projectile be-
cause they did not know alicias whereabouts what would
destroy the bat-men might also be fatal to her full of dejec-
tion they had returned to the projectile and it was there by
great good luck that the radio message found them

  the next morning a few hours after sunrise the two men
sighted a speck in the sky many miles distant they watched
its approached with intense excitement they did not doubt
that it was a martian flier coming to pilot them to the city

  the craft was the same one on which alicia had made her
escape from the crater and the bat-men and it was again
piloted by the martian who had rescued her it was unlike
anything the men had ever seen it was a combination of mono-
plane and helicopter and was capablc of both vertical and
horizontal flight it was elaborate of finish and design and re-
markably swift they marveled at the grace of its flight and
its speed for within a few minutes after they had sighted it
the plane was stilled alongside the projectile then a man like
themselves smiled engagingly and pointed in the direction
whence he had come

  dr fry turned to randolph

  alicia did not come i wonder why

  done up probably replied randolph but he seems all
right dont you think

  yes for of course hes the pilot sent out to direct us i am
perfectly willing to follow him

  dr fry nodded his acceptance of the flyers invitation and
instantly the plane was off

  the projectile followed the two men in it were amused as
the martiap continued to look back obviously to see whether
they could keep pace with him he could not know they re-
flected wjth amusement that the projectile from the earth could
fly all around the planet of mars within a few minutes

  the flight to the city was without incident on arriving the
pilot of the martian plane swept in graceful curves to a land-
ing field and alighted the projectile followed under perfect
control and came to a gentle rest on the ground before a con-
course of people gathered to witness the arrival of visitors from
another world

  at once a heavy guard was placed around the great shell
the multitude had begun to press forward human curiosity
the earth-men discovered was the same everywhere

  dr fry turned on leaving the projectile and encountered the
martian who had escorted them to the city he could not speak
to the pilot and be understood but he motioned first at the
projectile and then at the guard the martian showed that he
understood he spoke to the people directing their attention to
the guard and to the projectile itself his words and his manner
seemed to be emphatic and effective since the crowd fell back
before the guard and kept their distance then the pilot leading
the way through the human mass which separated to give them
passage conducted them to an elaborate rich-looking carriage
the pilot halted them a short distance away and stood at
attention

the carriage propelled by engines was ornate in design
a graceful equipage fit for a king and that in fact was
what it was-the royal carriage of the kor of osin who had
deigned to visit the landing field and witness the arrival of
human beings from another world

  the martian escorted the earth-men to the door of the car-
riage and halted there bowing almost to the ground the ad-
venturers stood erect and now they caught sight of alicia
seated in the carnage beside a man whom they took to be a
person of distinction this although they did not know it at
the time was the kor of osin ruler of the martian nation

the plans in my possession id say give her hell  but if we

other i

  the officers saluted and turned away lined on the deck on
both ends of the towering magnetic ray projector mounted
anti-aircraft guns were ready for instant action

chapter vii
an astonishing answer

there was something pitiful in the appearance of the
sky urchin as it was drawn irresistably down toward
the projection tower tail fore-most it seemed like a
great indomitable monster tliat had given up a struggle in total
exhaustion like a sword-fish tired out rolling over on its back
and being drawn forward on a taut line but the sky urchin
had not rolled over in utter despair it remained on even keel
though its tail pointed downward at a slight angle

  suddenly possessed with a growing fear that the sky ruler
might destroy the great airship rather than submit to inevit-
able apprehension professor marklcson groaned aloud and
there was no way in the world to prevent such a disaster should
the adventurous pirate feel the urge to release its gravity re-
pellent and crash it to earth or explode its fuel stores but
strangely nothing like that occurred not a sign of life existed
upon the huge craft as the scientist studied her transparent
bands with his binoculars the control cabin and the observa-
tion compartments seemed utterly deserted

  slowly but surely the ship was being drawn down as jack
reeves retracted the magnetic beam now she lay hardly more
than a half mile away glistening brilliantly in the rays of a
westering sun then to the astonishment of all who beheld
the ship a black dot appeared in the air directly under her
almost instantly the dot was swaying in the skies like a great
pendulum suspended under a bulging parachute  professor
markleson watched it through his glass a man had left
the sky urchin then another dot appeared and another each
becoming suspended as their parachutes bulged open at once
three high-powered police cars opened their deep-throated ex-
hausts and roared away in the direction of the floating pirates

  hardly had they disappeared from the isolated area than
from the sky urchin came pouring a steady stream of machine
gun slugs they whined around the scientist like so many
bees then as suddenly as they had come the muffled throb
of the guns ceased as a row of dots appeared under the crafts
belly more parachutes bulged but they carried their cargoes
down to eager waiting hands the guns roared again and
the professor stood calm in a rain of singing shells they
hummed melodies of death about his ears and spattered dirt
everywhere as they plopped into the ground only fifty yards
away an anti-aircraft gun suddenly roared a shell cracked
fifty feet beyond the sky urchin

  markleson saw two more parachutes open under atmospheric
resistance then another man leapt from the sky urchin the
scientist watched him through his glass the man wore no
parachute he thought that the man wore a tight-fitting fly-
ing outfit of black-but he was not sure he could not be-
lieve that the sky ruler would elect to take his own life by
suicide the man could easily have destroyed himself instantly
had he elected to explode the sky urchin a long time to
think about death-falling  feet the man tumbled head
over heels through the air to vanish behind a bank of foliage
a quarter of a mile away professor marklcson shuddered
imagining that he heard the dull thud of the body as it smashed

	  

an hour later unerring steps drew professor markleson to
the police morgue in washington despite the fact that

his brain pounded in protest an irresistible something drew him
on with a force comparable to the magnetic beam that brought
the sky urchin to rest its nose against jack reeves anchor-
ing-projection tower was it the magnetism that exists be-
tween two very dear friends that caused him to respond to the
urge to visit the morgue or was it just morbid curiosity to
learn if doctor mars jorgstedt had died or was suffering the
mortal agony of fatal injuries whatever it was it attracted
him protestingly to the forbidding gray building off the wide
traffic-jammed avenues

  he entered without a pause and was met by a blue-coated
minion of the law

  i am professor markleson captain he said his lips
trembling i want to see the man who killed himself by
jumping out of the sky urchin today i have a feeling that i
might know him personally i

  certainly professor i the captain replied at once go
right in-first door to the left but theres another gent in
there hes a dead ringer for the poor devil 

  a dead ringer-do they have a close resemblance the
scientist asked strangely he felt suddenly sick at heart
the captain grinned at him curiously

  if theyd been cast in the same mold they couldnt look
more alike professor i he replied go on in

  quietly the scientist swung open the door and entered the
first room to the left he paused just inside his hand still
on the door knob and stared from one face to another-the
dead and the living then with a light step he strode to the
side of his friend dr jorgstedt

  will you ever forgive me doctor ke said softly his
face sad and forlorn he placed an arm about the others
shoulders and peered into the deep-set features of the dead
broken man on the slab he wore neatly-trimmed whiskers
van dyke style the scientist scrutinized the deep-set features
of his friend a tear was streaming down the latters tanned
cheek

  who is lie doctor asked markleson do you know him
the famous astronomer peered into his friends forlorn face
few people knew that i had a brother-a twin brother
he replied erasing the stinging tear with a shaking finger he
was taken away from me about a year before you and i be-
came acquainted to be placed in a house of correction until
he was  evil influences had got hold of him and as he
grew older he mired himself deep in crime i have seen him
but five times in fifteen years the last time was two years
ago in arizona he swore to go straight but on learning
somehow of yaur wonderful ship he must have succumbed
again to an urge for adventure consequently he lies here-
on the last frontier-death

then you knew all along who had taken the shy urchinf
no not until you explained your case of mistaken identity
in the lounge of the scientists club my friend the astronomer
replied from sheer love for this brother i could not tell you
my secret then

  you are to be admired for your loyalty doctor just for
that professor markleson reached down and grasped his
hand im sorry that it was i who caused his death

  he did not blame you  nor did  it was his own due
reward said dr jorgstedt sternly they found on him a
letter addressed to me which told where the packet of papers
holding your plans was to be found in his letter he asked
that you do not judge him too harshly

  professor markleson nodded and grasped his friend warmly
by the arm they strode out of the room together and into
the street amid the shrill cries of the newsboys and the roar
of traffic hearing nothing each was lost in his own thoughts

the air trap

continued from page 



distance ahead and a ray of hope revived the pilot with set
teeth he plunged on and in a few more minutes had readied the
first clump of trees where he sank wearily to the ground there
was a glow of the devilish hue about him but it was very
faint and too weak to prove harmful

  tom the weak voice of his companion attracted his atten-
tion go on tom get out of here youve got a chance
if you beat it

  dont worry jim were both out of it the fresh air will
soon have you back on your feet

  but uie storm had passed and the ground rapidly drying
before jim could exert sufficient strength to regain his feet
how arc you feeling jim

  pretty shaky no life in me at all no taste no feeling-
well youll soon pull back im just about ok again now
but youll pull up faster if we get farther away from this
cursed place here lean on me and well take our time
how in the devil any air bandits could exist in a place like
that beats me jim remarked as they slowly made their way
back towards their plane

  thats one reason why there are none there

  what

  what we said about a magnetic field existing over the valley
was right tom grinnetf there is one there but it was not
put there by any air bandits that valley has a deposit of
some curious mineral that is continually giving off energy in
the form of electrostatic the whole valley is located over
this bed this elcctro-static leakage continues all the time
and keeps the soil and the air of the place in an unhealthy con-
dition thats why you see no vegetation flies or other life
in there the natives knew that there was something unhealthy
about the place and kept away from it now one proof that
this queer mineral deposit is giving off static electricity is the
fact that when the ground becomes moist the energy escapes
at a faster rate until you can see it at night in the form of
amber-colored shoots of fire also-

tjut do you mean that just because the air becomes moist
i the static in the air over the valley increases so much
that it even paralyzes the ignition systems of the planes

   whenever it is raining tom replied there is usually a
 thunderstorm passing over the valley the clouds in this storm
 are charged with a potential opposite to that of the ground and
 occasionally the difference of pressure of the two forccs is
 sufficient to cause a lightning bolt to strike the earth some
 where that discharge of lightning looks like a discharge
 from the sky to the earth but really there is as much energy
 passing from the earth to the sky along that flash during the
 discharge now when a storm passes over the valley its
 clouds charged oppositely to that of the forces in the valley
 cause a drawing effect on them and the leakage of energy
 from the ground to the sky increases greatly as it passes up
 in an attempt to neutralize the forces of opposite charge in
 the clouds also the moisture in the air and the ground increase
 the conductivity of the air between the clouds and the ground

   this valley jim seems to be an endless and limitless source
 of such energy and during a storm it releases such a heavy
 discharge of static that it drowns out radio signals makes the
 compass freeze and point up and down affects the human sys-
 tem producing that sick tired feeling and when the difference
 of pressure becomes very great the discharge from the valley
 is so violent that fire and electrical energy will leak off into
 the air from every sharp point or object tliat is touching the
 ground and pass straight up into the air

   the magnetic force of that field over the valley is so great
 during a thunderstorm that the ignition generators of the planes
 are affected so that they start missing and sputtering as a
 ship enters into the heart of the powerful static field between
 the clouds and the valley the planes ignition system steadily
 becomes worse as the electrical energy fails but the effects
 of the magnetic fields alone are not responsible for the death
 of weldon or the others who will likely be found in tliat val-
 ley there is a poisonous clement in that mineral deposit under
 the valley and it leaks off with the static discharges it is this
 that poisons the air and if you remain in the place long enough
 will kill you completely

   wait till watson hears about this tom jim said wearily

   yes i expect therell be a few government inspectors that
 will get transferred from the south african territory when
 watson lets loose

               the end

 tioning as well as could be expected i turned the great whales
 tail as high as possible and we floated right for the hilltop

the captain got his landing rope ready and prepared to lasso
the flagstaff

if i miss it lie said maybe the rope is long enough for
some of those who arc standing down below to grab ahold of
it heres hoping i

but he did not miss as we sailed ovef its top he dropped
a noose with unerring aim fairly over the staff and drew it
tight willard and i caught hold to help steady the ship and

bring it to a gradual stop as the rope paid out
we held our breath for fear the sudden strain would snap
the flagpole but our gallant craft responded nobly she swung
around into the wind and with the painted banner flung wide
came to a standstill

  a great shout went up from the erstwhile breathless crowd
while factory and fire whistles all over the city let loose in
concert answered by the deeper voices of the ocean liners an i
by the smaller craft far up and down the river

  the flight of the great whale was over

the invisible destroyer

continued from page 

   briefly then he recounted for a second time our experiences
during bur absence when he had concluded and had answered
a few o kieths questions harwood came forward with a
suggestion

   say vachell i think kieths arrival settles the question as
 to how we shall notify the world of our return he can make
 a trip back to the states in his plane

   thats a fine idea the scientist replied then he frowned
in thought i wonder-by jove i it would work i what do
you think of this kieth will return to north america where
the russian lias his headquarters and spread the report tliat
were back hell make sure that the news reaches demetrio-
vichs cars when he hears it liell naturally rush here to
verify the report and that will be our opportunity to use our
weapons and rid the world of its menace

  and at the same time kieth harwood added you can
have some of the officials at washington send a number of
transoceanic planes to take us from the island if things turn
out the way we expect them to well be in a position to sign
the world union pact in a short time but our immediate con-
cern after getting rid of demetriovich will be to undo what-
ever damage he has done

   kieth nodded ill do the best i can about that he said
but ill meet with quite a bit of difficulty demetriovich
has placed every nation under the direct control of his russian
followers he quells any disturbances that arise with that ac-
cursed cone of his and right now he is completing three other
cones for the use of his lieutenants commerce and industry
are at a standstill as a result of the russians radical methods
people are starving i and all this damage caused by one man i
its awful to contemplate i he was silent for a moment
then exclaimed

   well the sooner i get back and start things moving that
much quicker will order be restored

a new attack

turning he moved toward his plane we followed
and as he soared into the air some moments later watched
his eastern flight until he disappeared in the distance

   the rest of that day and all of the following night passed all
 too slowly and-the night-sleeplessly for most of us on the
 island we feared a night attack by the russian and kept
 great beacon lights from the landing field trained upon the sky
 the rising sun-received a hearty welcome in the morning

  that morning seemed endless with nothing occurring fo
break the monotony of waiting noon came-and suddenly
a cry arose from one of the men appointed as a lookout

  hes coming

  in a moment we had gathered in a scattered group on the
lawn before the union hall while we waited we looked to
our glass ray-filter bands and our rods to be certain that ah
was in readiness for demctriovichs destruction

  a minute of anxious waiting-then the conewas above us
we expected to hear the thunderous voice but no voice came
instead a blinding white ray flashed down upon us the
island seemed to tremble under our feet

   at the same time that he released the ray upon us a veritable
 shower of thin intensely powerful beams darted up toward the
 cone from the balls on the tips of our metal rods had it not
 been for our lack of experience in operating our strange weap-
 ons and our consequent erratic aim demetriovich and his cone
 would have been blasted into a cinder as it was only a few
 of the rays hit their mark but so effectual was the work of
 those few that the white ray was snuffed out and the cone
 staggered i

it had evidently escaped serious injury for a second after

our rays struck-indeed before we could adjust our aim the
cone leaped high into the air our rays followed and evidently
took some effect in spite of the cones increased altitude for
a moment later like a frightened hare it darted away in the
direction from whence it had come

  some of the men began shouting triumphantly vachell
raised his hand for silence

   theres nothing to shout about he frowned i feel any-
thing but elated although we did escape unscathed from the
russians rays our victory was empty demetriovich escaped
and now he knows that we are able to resist his rays and
that we have weapons with which to fight against him who
can tell what hell do next i

   and remember this-although we arc unaffected by his rays
the same is not true of the island if he returns and floods
us with the rays that bring about the travel through the vi-
bratory scale the island will vanish from beneath our feet
and well all be drowned i

  the only way out that i can sec vachell said after a
pause is to send a radio message for help and leave the island
as soon as possible

   in a moment the entire group had started toward the tower
that held the radio transmitter but when we arrived there
our only hope was destroyed the radio was useless the
russians rays although they hadnt injured us had left the
transmitter burned out blackened wrecked beyond all repair

  we returned to the union building in dejection shortly
before we reached it harwood addressed vachell

   leo he said our position isnt so hopeless after all if
 demetriovich does return with his cone before he learns that
 we alone can resist his rays and that the island itself is un-
 protected we will have destroyed him our aim wont be as
 inaccurate the second time as it was the first

   i suppose youre right vachell replied at any rate it
seems that all we can do now is wait if only we hadnt left
our plane in that other world we could carry the conflict to
the russian but-we left it

   the balance of the day dragged by on leaden feet as night
approached we became restless apprehensive nor were our
spirits buoyed up by the discovery that the searchlights that
we had used the night before were burned qut we would
have to spend the night in darkness if the cone returned we
would be unable to detect its approach

   darkness found us waiting we were all close to exhaustion
yet we dared not sleep there was little or no conversation
for some reason we had no desire to talk

  hour after hour passed by one oclock came-then two
and without warning four wide beams of violet radiance split
the blackness they came from the different points of the
compass and converged on one central point

  four cones-could we overcome them

we centered our efforts on one of them aiming at the
source of the violet beam suddenly the ray from that
cone was snuffed out and a moment later a loud crash some
distance away told us that one of our combatants was out of
the fight

   the destruction of the first cone had taken but a moment
quickly we turned our attention to a second a beam of red
descended from this cone now a beam that set nearby shrub-
berry afire but that had no effect upon us we showered our
slender rays upon it to such good cffect that it too was snuffed
out

  only two cones remained and we had not been harmed

   as we turned toward the third both cones darted high into
the air then twin streams of white leaped from them the
the invisible destroyer



island shuddered under the impact it was the ray that caused
the passage into other vibratory worlds  frantically we sent
our rays flashing upward

  a fleeting picture passed through my mind a picture of all
of us falling into a bottomless pit-of mighty walls of water
rushing in upon us-of motionless floating bodies   

  fortune was with us  our rays again found their mark and
the third cone fell to the island like a plummet 
one more cone to destroy but was there time  the island
was almost gone i our footing was becoming insecure the
island wavering on the borderline between the worlds the
cone was darting here and there erratically now we could not
follow with our rays a moment more and it would be ended 
a moment more-

  a sudden sharp explosion-an ear-splitting crash tliat shook
the earth-and the white beam was gone the island was solid
under our feetl
we stared at each other in wonder by the fitful light of the
burning shrubbery on the brink of destruction and a bolt
from above had saved us what had been the cause of that
explosion something amiss in the cone perhaps effected by
our rays

  and then we saw the helicopter swaying drunkenly from
side to side its motors dead supported only by its buoyancy
tanks it settled slowly to the earth it landed a short distance
away

  quickly we rushed over to the plane its entire front was
smashed in and amid the wreckage the lower half of his
body crushed to a bloody pulp we found kieth he was still
conscious his face smiling wanly seen by the flickering light
looked ghastly

  clasping vacheus hand weakly he whispered

  well leo i guess its almost over but im satisfied evw

the

since demetriovich began his insane actions ive felt guilty
in a measure i was responsible for i was the one who goaded
him on back there in the alleghenies i-i wanted to make
amends

  his voice grew weaker-was barely audible

   when his cones left the-the mainland several hours ago
i followed close behind in-in my plane i had three nitro-
bombs with me two of them missed their target but the third
one scored a hit i was too close to the cone when it exploded
and i-i think part of the-cone-struck my-my-plane

   his voice trailed off into silence he stiffened convulsively
 shuddered and suddenly grew limp he was dead he had
 died for a cause-a martyr

   almost over night the world was restored to normalcy with
the menace of the russian removed commerce and industry
resumed activity

   after the affairs of the earth had been righted the world
executives gathered in the union hall and without pomp or
ceremony signed the pledge that united all nations under one
international government and under its sane and intelligent
ruling the world today is enjoying a prosperity unparalleled
in history

   the remains of demetriovichs cones are in the international
museum along with the ray-repellent bands and the metal
rods they are things that arc out of place in our present
peaceful world in the museum they lie mute evidence of the
truth of the well-nigh incredible history of the forming of the
world union

   and finally today a great monument is standing on the union
island looking out over the sea it is the statue of a slender
intelligent-faced man who seems to be looking thoughtfully
ahead a man who indirectly helped to bring chaos upon the
world and who gave his life to restore order a statue of
allen kieth martyr

what is a pancake

editor aviation forumi

   i am a sdcnce fiction enthusiast but know
very little about airplanes would you please
answer two or three queries upon the subject

   	in a newspaper account an aviator was
said to have pancaked what relation has this
gastronomical delicacy to a plane

   	who was the first man to fly across the
engksh channel

   	what effect does rain have on a balloon

maximillian d watt

st chera co
corozal canal zone

    a plane is said to have pancaked when
it has been leveled off at a greater altitude than
is normal in a landing which means that it
leveled off too soon this procedure will cause
it to stall and to descend on a rather steeply
inclined path with the wings at a very large
angle of attack and with practically no appre-
ciable bank whatsoever

   	a frenchman louis bleriot in a mono-
plane of bis own design and construction
powered by a small three cylinder motor-cycle
type air-cooled engine of about  horsepower
flew the twenty-one miles between calais and
dover in twenty-three minutes an average of
fiftythee miles per hour this flight was made
on july   and the aviator had perfcct
control over bis machine skeptics bad been
awaiting a disastrous outcome hut so thorough
bad been the planning of the flight that after
reaching the englisn shore bleriot circled
around for a while to display his confidence in
the craft before seeking a landing place

   	inclement weather very often produces a
noticeable effect upon balloons and dirigibles
rain will cool the gas within the bag causing
it to decrease in volume obviously since a
balloons ascension is primarily dependent upon
the volume of its gas the effective lift will be
reduced while light snow may blow off heavy
wet snow or sleet will build up on the bag or
cars and weigh the ship down

   a clear sky frequently produces an interesting
effect on a balloon in flight when the suns
rays are very strong they will heat the gas and
cause it to expand this will increase its volume
and effective lift-editor

acute judging from the number of readers who
ask us when  it will be published there are
many mechanical problems to be considered in
publishing a new magazine however and the
time has not yet come when we can make any
announcement in the meantime opinions on an
addition to our group arc always welcome-

  is it true that a german inventor has created
a rocket that will fly outside the earths at-
mosphere how far has rocket flying developed
in germany i read so many conflicting reports
that i would be very much obliged if you will
print a brief review of experiments that have
been made another ouestion what is the roost
popular fuel for rocket-ships what size are
the rockets that have been built today i thank
you in advance for your reply

no but the question of building a rocket
that can penetrate into outer space and possibly
to the moon is holding the attention of scien-
tists with prof hermann oberth max valier
and fritz von opel experimenting with the
possibilities of the rocket much is expected to
develop professor oberth who has been
working on the rocket principle for many years
is now having his experiments financed by the

	after the rocket leaves the earths atmos-
phere what is there present to support combus-
tion

	if after the rocket leaves the earths at-
mosphere and the propulsion tubes cease to
function would the inertia be sufficient to oarry
it beyond the pull of gravity or to the moon

	if there is no air on the moon how would
the rocket be guided so that it would not fall
on the moon

taking your questions in order the solutions
to these problems of space flying are as follows

	a rocket would carry its own materials for
combustion the propellant explosive in a rocket
consists of chemicals containing both oxygen
and the substance with which it combines to
form a gas the ordinary black gunpowder for
example supplies its own oxygen in the form
of potassium nitrate and does not denend upon
atmospheric oxygen for combustion when the
temperature of any portion of a charge of gun-
powder is raised to ignition point which is
dope by medium of a match a fuse etcj the
oxygen stored in the potassium salt combines
with the carbon which is represented by dirr-

how fast can a man fall

editor aviation forum

   what is the greatest speed an average sized
roan can obtain while falling freely through the
air what determines the speed

               f maccolluch

mt clemens mich

   the greatest speed is  miles per hour
at that point the increase of speed due to
gravity is counter-balanced by the increased
resistance of the air	 

   for although the mans speed is increasing
normally due to the acceleration of gravity the
resistance due to the air is being increased by
the square of the speed-editor

the height of atmosphere

editor avialion forumt

   not long ago the question arose at school as
to the height of the atmosphere would you
mind informing me as to its correct height

   when are you going to publish a sequel to
the lost martian  it was a very good story
dont print too many short stories because just
as you get interested in one the story is oyer
the moon conquerors is one of the best
stories i have ever read when do we get an

the atmosphere forms an envelope over the
earth which is believed to be between  and
 miles thick it is naturally densest at the
sea-level and becomes gradually more rarificd
upwards at a height of w miles it is only
about half os dense as at the surface and at 
miles only a quarter hence the difficulty of
breathing experienced by climbers of lofty moun-
tains such as mount everest and aviators
who attempt to break altitude records the ques-
tion of an air wonder quasterlv is becoming

scientific accomplishments is now making one
called the girl in the moon and the girl
uses a rocket ship developed by professor
oberth the professor however is cautious
in making statements about his pet he calls
the moon rocket still a dream being appar-
ently content to build a ship that can attain an
altitude of thirty miles and have it return to a
designated spot the first tests of his develop-
ment are expected to be made on the north sea
coast in the near future

  his present experimental rocket releases it-
self automatically from a mortar and has at-
tached a parachute which unfolds to allow the
rocket to descend slowly to earth as with
other experiments it is the fuel problem that is
causing most concern the liquid fuels seems
to be gaining favor liquid oxygen combined
with benzine alcohol and other energy produc-
ing agencies the rocket is  feet long and
about  inches in diameter the liquid fuel
when brought in contact with some galvanized
carbon consumes it and produces a gas which
is expelled at the nrte of  meters a second
the reaction to this propelling the rocket up-
ward



coal and sulphur thus creating large quantities
of hot gases chiefly carbon di-oxide sulphur
di-oxide and the mono-oxides of both elements
the de-compression of these gases forms the ex-
plosion and in the case of a rocket the propul-
sive force as the gases escape from tne tail
end of the rocket the recoil projects the rocket-
ship forward describing this in chemical terms
we say that the potassium nitrate releases its
oxygen atoms which combine with carbon two
atoms of oxygen to one of carbon thus form-
ing one molecule of carbon di-oxide

	as the earth exerts an influence on the
moon and even the moon exerts a powerful in-
fluence on the earth as is demonstrated by
the tides of the sea it is obvious that there is
no such phenomenon as being beyond uie pull
of gravity we take it that our correspondent
is asking us whether the speed of the rocket
would be sufficient to carry the rocket to the
moon after the propulsion tubes bad ceased to
function thin would naturally depend upon the
speed of the rocket at that moment if it was
traveling at about  miles a second it could
forever escape the gravitational attraction of
the earth

	if the moon were devoid of atmosphere
the rocket-ship could be guided by the firing of
small auxiliary rockets projecting at various
angles as we illustrate in the accompanying
diagram-editor

editor air wonder stories

 am a new reader of the am wonder
sroaies but what stories i have read i surely
enjoyed all but mr englands flying legion 
i say that because his descriptions do not come
up to my ideas of what the world will be like
in  or whatever the date is i am sure
we shall have taller buildings than he states
and will see all the wonders of his giant air-
planes long iwfore that date the story is
more or less interesting but the commander is
not my ideal type of man

liners of space and the red ace are
the beat stories i have read and the vanish-
ing fleet comes second i should liko to know
how many of your readers agree with me

i feel that the more your writers me their
imagination the better especially when they
develop their descriptions in a sdentifio way

mr grace evidently desires to check up his
opinions against those of other readers in
regard to his ideas about the imminence of new
scientific developments and inventions we are
indinded to think that the net fifty years will
see a greater progress than during the past
fifty or hundred years and that in an in-
credibly short space of time we will actually
experience the t marvels described by our
authors but this is a matter of opinion per-
haps we are over enthusiastic or prejudiced-

wants more magazines

editor air wonder stories

i subscribe regularly to eleven magazines ol
which ait wonder stories is one and  have
still money enough to buy two more these
are au wonder quarterly and inter-
planetary stories when will yon publish
these two books i am sure they will be
eagerly welcomed by your readers

i see that vou have cut down on the non-
fiction material and added a few more pages of
stories keep this up it is fiction that we
want good stories not merely news which we
can get from the newspapers	

i liked evans of the earth guard  by ed-
mond hamilton because it was different than
his usual stories the last installment of the
firing legion was great  hope you will
publish more stories by george allen england
-tales of the future i also like war stories of
the future how about a long novel of that

sie i would like to sec pictures of mr
rnsback and paul on the editorial page each
month	

are there iooks that tell yon how to write
stories if so will you please name one or

the best way to learn to write stories is
to vrtie just practise writing them and then
compare the ones that you have written with
ones you see published in magazines and try
to note if yours lack something that the others
have when writing stories remember to use
double spacing on your typewriter and leave
a wide margin to one side there are a host
of books on writing storlea but we rather
think that tbe new author will do better to
just practise than to read books on how
to write such books can only help you
after you have attained a certain pro-
ficiency we are giving mr  darrows sug-
gestion about having more magazines our serious
consideration-editor

f your readers when i ask when you are go-
ing to publish an air wonder quarterly
heres hoping that we get one soon

  surely mr ackerman must have realized
that the gigantic shove in the space visit-
ors indicated a space ship from which this
shovel was operated interplanetary transpor-
tation is inherent in this popular story and the
steelite globes used to carry explosive bombs
to the upper atmosphere were certainly balloons
our author dealt more with the effects rather
than the original causes of communication from
another world but nevertheless his story cer-
tainly is classified as an air wonder type

  edmond hamiltons story seems to have re-
ceived universal commendation more letters
have poured into this office praising his origi-
nality than we have received about any story
for a long time those who liked the space
visitors will do well to read this popular
authors stories in our sister magazine scien-
tific detective monthly here mr hamil-
ton has branched out and createa a series of
scientific stories that are astonishingly new-
we might almost say revolutionary edmond
hamilton fans will be surprised to sec what
their favorite author can do

  as for the air wonder quarterly we shall
get this when we arc mechanically able to do
so the publishing of four magazines with the
large circulatidn of air wonder is in itself
a stupendous task necessitating an organization
not always appreciated by the actual reader-

what about air science
club

editor air wonder stories

  in the march issue i have just read two
different criticisms of george a englands
story the flying legion

  i agree with mr euler of new york city
that it is one of the best adventure stories yet
published as for mr mcdowell he lives so
tar back in missouri that they still use sulkys
instead of autos also those small towns do not
understand human nature

  eds big three meaning ed earl repp
ed e chappelow and ed hamilton are the
best authors you have althou mackay and
gleason are not being lost sight or 

  i would be glad to correspond with anyone
in an air science gub

            puckety road rfd no 
                              verona pa

  some famous people have said that the
small town is the place in which one gets
closest to human nature we feel sure that
mr schmidts statement will meet with many
denials from our readers  but tbe idea of
an air science club is ouite interesting in
fact it should be very popular providing it got
off to a good start those who agree with
this view might be glad to write mr schmidt
direct or through the columns of this maga-
zine-editor

another boost for ed

editor air wonder stories 

mr hamilton deserves credit for his story
the space visitors thats tbe type of story
i call different but i dont know how it got
into air wonder stoeies as it makes no men-
tion of airplanes dirigibles and such things as
belong in an aviation magazine

the flying legion is a great stonr and
mr england evidently knows his stuff i think
i am only voicing the wishes of the majority

would you rather we kept to our usual type
of fiction or try out some new authors and
new kinds of stories they may be better
or perhaps they may not be so good

  incidentally if mr hoernlein doubts that
edmond hamilton can write unique stories let
him buy a copy of scientific detectiv
monthly for april or may this popular au-
thor has written unique stories in both issues
of our sister magazine and is now preparing
several others edmond hamilton fans will be
astounded when they read the invisible

 a review of the april issue

editor air wonder stories

  just finished the april issue of aia wonder
stories and would say it is the best yet tbe
stories are unsurpassed for their type i have
little criticism to make

  through the meteors was a great story
and i enjoyed it fully

  the heat ray was pretty fair but not as
good as the others

  the flying buzz-saw was the only story
i did not like it failed to hold my interest al-
though i can find no definite reason for this

  evans of tbe earth guard was the second
best story in the issue i think it would be
wise to print one interplanetary story in each
issue as a contrast to the atmospheric navi-
gation stones

  the meteoric magnet was fair but dkl not
have much force now comes tbe big praise tbe
last part of  he flying legion  was the best
 can read the authors mind in this installment
from the way tbe story runs he is thinking
of wnun a

                      chestnut ave
                     springfield ohio

  many readers have praised the last in-
stallment of tbe flying legion it seems
to be generally accepted that the author ex
celled himself in the last part of the story
but whether there will be a sequel or not we
are unable to sar just now

  through the meteors is another story
which has received general commendation so
our correspondents opinions and literary taste
seem to co-incide with the majority-editor

novelty or repetition

editor air wonder stories

  i first became familiar with science fiction in
november  when air wonder stories
appeared i subscribed to them immediately

  in my opinion science wonder stories is
better than air wonder stories because in
the latter there is too much repetition that
is most stories center round some super-scien-
tific criminal who is trying to conquer tbe
world

  please have more of edmond hamilton his
stories too are usually repetitions but they
are nevertheless enjoyable

henry g hoernlein jr

               e madison street
                           baltimore md

  that our correspondent still enjoys edmond
hamiltons stories even though they appear to
him repetitions seems to indicate that you
cannot nave too much of a good thing in other
words that it is better for tbe magazine to
keep on printing a type of story that has proved
popular than to change to a new type possibly
by a new author

what about this ail wonder readers

 

the red ace

editor air wonder stories

  i have been reading an wosde stowm
for some time and found in every one of them
good stories

  i enjoyed very much the vanishing fleet
by henrik dahl juve though it is a little out
of the ordinary

  the red ace by eugene george key is
positively tbe best air story i ever read it
is futuristic in a way but not impossible i
shall be glad to read more of tbe schneider-
golden-ray tube co for i hope they will not
be content with tracing the carson of the
moon to his headquarters

           m l swalwell

 santa monica blvda
hollywood california
many readers have complimented the red
ace by eugene george kcl we hope to
have another story by this popular author which
will appear in an early issue-editor

constructive advice

editor air wonder stories

 i am an ardent reader of your several pub-
lications and must therefore in general ap-
prove of tbe stories found therein i do not
believe in carping criticism and in tbe criti-
cisms i now offer there is no desire to cast
slurs upon your magazines i offer them rather
as constructive criticisms

  i do not care bow far your writers roam
trto the realms of fancy and the unknown
when however they are writing in the realm
of the unknown they should hold strictly to
scientific accuracy they should be alert for
any fallacy

in the march number of air wonder
stories mr hamilton in his space visitors
makes a very stupid error when he causes bis

unknown mayaji cities re-
vealed in lindbergh flights

 in bve days of flying over unmapped areas
 of mexico guatemala and british hon-
 duras col and mrs charles lindbergh and
 scientists from the carnegie institution of
 washington have carried on archaeological
 reconnaissance that if it could be done on the
 ground would require eight years of mule-back
 travel using a large hydroplane in which col
 lindbergh had been pioneering the new inter-
 national routes of the pan-american airways
 many miles of bush and dense jungle were
 searched from the air for signs of ruins of
 mayan citiea hitherto unknown to science

    five discoveries of new maya ruins rewarded
  the exploring parties aboard the lindbergh
  plane five white columns of crumbling mava
  masonry were sighted near tical guatemala
  on a flight into the unexplored area near

  that the carnegie archaeologists have studied
  extensively this was the first finding of rums
  that seem to be previously uncharted and un-

 sion-time it is impossible for the physicist
 to apply definite standards of measurement to
 apace without fixing their relation to a definite
 point in time

    in somewhat the same manner the great sci-
  entist disposes of mans place in the universe
  so far as time is concerned man is a negligi-
  ble quantity his existence is a fraction of a
  second and as for immortality-personal im-
  mortality-einstein simply does not believe in

  kind to a tree with many sprouts  it does not
  seem to me that every sprout and every branch
  possesses an individual soul

new television devices to
appear

  television receivinf set almost en-
  tirely new in construction will be required
  shortly according to d e reploglc chair-
  man of the television committee of the radio
  manufacturers association 

     television will require distintt and new
  receivers separate from the radio broadcast
  receiver he said this is assured from the
  progress being made in jhe laboratory at
  least three more television broadcast stations
  are being planned for this winter trans-
  mitting to date is frankly experimental

     the next step he believes will probably be
  the photographing of outdoor scenes and by
  means of a quick-developing film transmitter
  these will be put very quickly on the air sev-
  eral methods of doing this are now in process
  of completion and give good promise of success

     following this the next step seems to mr
  reploglc to be logically the broadcasting of
  events as they occur directly through a suitably-
  designed transmitter

airplane safety requires less
dependence on pilot

  t ather than expect airplane pilots to be
  supermen who will always function at one-
  hundred per cent efficiency in an emergency
  desiguers of airplanes must try to improve the
  construction of their machines to the point where
  they will be easier to land will not have a
  tendency to spin and have satisfactory con-
  trollability such are the conclusions reached
  by the national advisory committee for aero-
  nautics in its annual report recently made to
  congress

 the department of commerce made an
 analysis of air accidents in  and came to
 the conclusion that in nearly half of the mishaps
 the pilot was to blame- had his judgment been
 better or had he not become confused by some
 untoward set of circumstances bad his reac-
 tion been better and quicker the situation
 would have been met adequately while this is
 all true enough and while medical supervision
 of pilots always strict is likely to become even
 more stringent nevertheless flying should be
 made safer through the elimination from air-
 planes of certain undesirable aerodynamic char-
 acteristics

r- claims airship speed
record

  the british dirigible i- has claimcd the
  world speed record for airshios on the
  grounds that it achieved a speed of  miles
  per hour on a twelve-hour test flight in a fog
  the best recorded speed of the graf zeppelin is
  said to be  miles per hour according to sir
  charles dcnnistoun-burney head of the company
  which built the airship the huge craft attained
  a speed of  yi miles above the maximum speed
  specified in the contract and this brings england
  within sight of a cruising speed of  miles per
  hour-which sir charles considers essential for
  successful commercial operation it is u be
  noted that the new speed record was attained
  when fully  hp was kept in reserve and
  with this added propulsion a speed of over 
  miles seems quite possible at the present time

british prevent corrosion
in flying boat

 a revolutionary advance in the con-
 struction of british flying boats is now
 being made by the substitution of stainless steel
 plating for the firmer duralumin sheet up to
 the water line and the effect of this change will
 be that the flying boats will now be practically
 indestructible by corrosion they will have a
 longer hull life than a ship without the con-
 tinual repainting that marine vessels require in
 the past duralumin sheet has been used ex
 dusively as this alloy is easily worked and it
 has been a simple matter to beat it into the
 required curves duralumin however is prone
 to sea water corrosion and while great advances
 have been made in prolonging its water life
 flying boat builders have tried for many years to
 use stainless steel older stainless steels were
 not impervious to sea water but the present
 alloy-a nickel chromium steel-is quite what
 is desired

seek acoustic altimeter
for airplanes

 leo p delasso who hni worked out
 several devices for use in aviation is at
 work upon the source of a sound which will
 filter through noises aboard an airplane this
 will be used in a precision altimeter which will
 measure height by the time it takes a sound to
 travel to the ground and echo back to the air-
 plane one of the chief difficulties is the multi-
 plicity of sound aboard an airplane it was
 necessary to find a tone entirely different from
 ny of those in an aircraft-which was done
 now the task is to find the source of a sound
 which will be of sufficient pitch and intensity to
 actuate the recording device an acoustic
 altimeter would be of great value in aviation
 because it would permit pilots caught in fogs
 oyer unfamiliar territory to know exactly how
 high they were

guides dirigible while sus-
pended below it

experiments have been carried ont on
diritnblcs at wright field ohio and
langley field virginia which show that the
airships can be directed by an observer hanging
far below the craft in a sub-cloud observation
car use of the observation car permits the
dirigible to fly in or above the clouds where
it is hidden from observers on the ground while
the observer in the car suspended below the
clouds by a cable directs the flight of the ship
the cable contains a telephone core by means of
which communication is maintained this ar-
rangement will be used in the future if neces-
sary for bombing expeditions but mainly for
assisting all types oi dirigibles to land in a
fog the rear end of tbe nacelle which acts as
an automatic rudder prevents the car from
revolving as the ship moves

transcontinental plane fare
greatly reduced

the most drastic cut in air-travel rates thus
far has been announced by the transcon-
tinental air lines which in conjunction with
the pennsylvania and santa fi railroads oper-
ates a forty-eight hour service between new
york and los angeles this new rate is below
tho usual extra-fare and pullman rates on rail-
roads so that competition between tne two
methods of transportation has begun in deadly
earnest the economic results of the fare slash
will demonstrate effectively whether or not tne
public is air-minded it had been affirmed before
continued on page 
the new reduction thnt only the high rates pre-
vented a great many people from making use
of the unusually speedy transportation offered
by air lines but now there is no such excuse
and the success of the experiment will indicate
also just how far the united states has advanced
in regard to aviation

  the new rate from new york to los angeles
is  which is amazingly low in com-
parison with former tariffs and which compares
favorably with the rates charged by the rail-
roads covering a similar distance between
cities on the transcontinental route the rate will
be c per mile as against c before the change
was made in every department of their services
some of the large transportation companies are
making these reductions colonel lindbergh

radio picture system speeds
transmission

  by means of a special application of tbe
  principles of multi-telegraphy and telephony
  a new method for the facile transmission of

  pures by radio is in process of development
   ranger design engineer of the radio
  corporation of america reports the successful
  conclusion of tbe experiments leading to the
  new system

     the principles mentioned will be applied so
  tbat two or more channels may be used simul-
  taneously and the result of each clearly
  brought out by careful filtering in the receiver
  this principle may be applied in another
  way two or more channels used one following
  the other in very rapid succession that is
  every few thousandths of a second according
  to the demand placed upon each channel in
  tbe transmission of the picture

     vacuum tubes arranged in group formation
  make possible the new device there being as
  many groups as there are channels in use
  small condensers placed in the tube circuits
  make possible the interlocking between these
  groups for lengths of time infinitesimally small

   the question that mr latham puts with
regard to the error in the space visitor is
more complex than it appears mr latham as-
sumes that the spheres will come to rest when
the spheres displace their volume of rarefied air
found at the three mile level he must re-
member that when the spheres arc first re-
leased they acquire a velocity upward due to
their buoyancy and might be apt to over-
shoot their natural level greativ for ex-
ample a very light body when immersed in
water might easily shoot to the surface and fly
into the air

   we do not however say that mr latham
is incorrect we would like to receive his calcu-
lations so that we may print them for the bene
nt of our readers-editor

  the editor of the aviation forum needs waking
up tho there are several errors in the last
number which should not have slipped thru
whats his age anyhow for instance motored
gliders have been in existence for years in
germany the plane in which von wart hausen
flew the best part around the world was such a
motorized glider then about the speed of a
falling body tests have been carried out with
delayed chute opening and men have fallen more
than a mile before opening the chute with the
result that it was proven that the maximum
falling speed of the human body is in theneigh-
borhood of  miles then flying freight
train has tail wheel a device employed ion
before the war on the other side why publish
accounts of harebrained schemes like that new
eara marine ship development anybody who
has ever been to sea in a ship will realize how
long such a contraption would last the nr-
three waves would smash it completely

  another kick englands the flying i
gion didnt start bad but has now deteriorate
into the neurotic drivel of an unsatisfied adolcs

hempstead l i
mr hehr is evidently well informed on
aviation matters in respect to inventions we
must remember that many inventions lie dor-
mant for years before they are developed or put
to use the tail-wheel is such a one it
appeared in various forms in france and italy
long before it entered general usage its de-
velopment was retarded to a great extent by the
fact that the skid acted as a brake on the air-

sane while taxiing along the ground with the
velopment of wheel brakes the necessity for
a skid vanished and thus the tail wheel became
standardized equipment on the modern airplane

   answering your second criticism we doubt
whether knowledge for good or evil can be kept
from those unqualified to use it in fact it
seems unfortunately true that many scientific
inventions of the past have been utilised by the
criminal elements in the community before they
came into general usage admittedly the pres-
ent flay problem of restricting the criminal
by taking away his weapons is becoming more
and more important this seems to us a matter
on which our readers might like to wice their
opinions-editor

on overcoming gravity

editor air wonder stories

   i am very much interested in the discussion
of gravitation in tbe last issue of your maga-
zine and i have no doubt that you will be
swamped with letters and questions from readers
on this subject however since nothing is posi-
tively known as to the cause of gravitation i
presume anyone may express himself with
safety

   it would seem that no one who expects to con-
tinue functioning as a living organism would

wish for the nullification of gravity on any gen-
eral scale nearlv every act of his life if not
life itself would be affected by such a happen-
ing even were a person able to take passage in
a space flyer which would necessarily be with-
out gravitation after being removed from the
earth to any great distance he would certainly
wish to have it restored locally or compensated
for in some way in the vehicle itself otherwise
he would not know what to do with bis limbs or
in fact how to act at all

   however it seems not altogether impossible
that this force may at some time be controlled or
harnessed to do work f upon the earth person-

the city of

by laurence manning
and

fletcher pratt

 a most fascinating tale with
 an unusual theme-perplex-
 ing and enjoyable    

 in the city of the living dead by fletcher pratt and laurence man-
 ning ihesc two authors of the first rank treat of a subject so unusual that we are
 sure it will create a sensation it is known that we are aware of each experience
 that we have only because our sense organs have transmitted certain impressions-to us
 suppose it were possible to substitute a mechanism which would allow us to have any
 experience we wish without physically undergoing it that such a thing would create
 the most revolutionary change in human life our authors convincingly show

 golf streak gold by ed erl repp we
 have an abundance of scientific evidence that
 sea water contains gold in a finely divided state
 in fact one authority tells us in the gulf stream
 there are literally hundreds of  millions of dol-
 lars worth of gold passing a given point every
 day it is altogether possible to extract this
 precious metal but if it were attempted there
 would be perilous dangers and complications that
 must be overcome in this the newest of his
 offerings ed earl repp gives us a remarkable
 story of modern gold mining with all his
 unbeatable thrills and adventures

 the evening star by dr david h keller
 we come to the concluding installment of this
 remarkable sequel to the conquerors if the
 incidents that lr keller pictures or the strange
 creatures that his fertile mind has conjured see
 to be impossible to us we can turn to many
 scientific authorities who state that the forms
 that life may take are almost limitless those
 who have watched the strange career of the
 conquerors will find in this installment a cul-
 mination that is sudden breath-taking and for
 our human race quite satisfying

  out from one object across space and pulling
  on another object would it not be more rea-
  sonable to believe that gravitation results from
  a pushing force as has been suggested by sev-
  eral scientists a or perhaps raauy forces tend-
  ing to push bodies toward each other in that
  case the screen to look for would not be one
  that is transparent to the force but one that
  stops the radiations at least in part such a
  screen would properly be placed not between
  the objects attracted but on the far side of
  one of them there may or may not be a sub-
  stance which is capable of acting in this way
  if of sufficient thickness

    harnessing such a force would not amount
  to perpetual motion any more than using the
  wiud by means of a wind mill or shutting out
  the sunlight by means of a shade

    of course if gravitation is the result of ac-
  celeration in a space-time continuum of four
  dimensions many of your readers including
  myself will have to give up speculating upon
  the subject but it is to be hoped that it is
  not so terrible a thing as that

    i would be pleased to know whether there are
  other readers who have somewhat similar idea
  on this subject

    of coursc no one would wish for nullifica-
  tion of gravity on a general scale it is by
  gravity that we are able to control our phy-
  sical actions and most of tbe mechanical con-
  trivances existing it is on the force of gravity
  that our drainage systems depend our water
  supply even our food in a weightless world
  seeds blown from flowering crops and vegetation
  would not fall to earth and with the restric-
  tion of organic growth the chemical balance of
  the atmosphere would be upset so that the
  human race would be wiped out even should we
  avoid all oher dangers co-existent with this
  state

space flying ships both in the fiction of the

  st and the actuality of the future certainly

    corporate an artificial gravitational force
  within their mechanisms the human body is
  to constructed that a sudden nullification of
  the force of gravity on an individual person
  would result in immediate death our bodies
  contain a complicated valve system by which
  our blood is prevented from accumulating in
  our feet and lower extremities  ihe regulation
  and mechanism of the human body is as de-
  pendent and adapted to gravitational force as it
  is to atmospheric pressure

    the theory that gravitation is the result of
  acceleration in a space-time continuum for four
  dimensions is unnecessarily obscure if we
  regard gravity as the mutual attraction be-
  tween one mass and another the strength of
  which can be calculated by the dimensions of
  these masses we have a working principle which
  will enable us to understand tbe general condi-
  tions space fliers of the future will have to
  operate under the moon is smaller than the
  earth-therefore tbe force of gravity on the
  surface of the moon is less than that on the
  surface of the earth should there be life on
  planets larger than the earth this life will be
  adapted to the stronger gravitational force main-
  taining on those worlds this is a simple law
  stated in simple terms aud abstruse theories
  about gravity merely becloud our understanding

    as a matter of tact this law was laid down
  by newton who in suggesting that gravity was
  fundamentally a property of matter stated the
  law of universal attraction as follows every
  particle of matterin the universe attracts every
  other particle with a force varying  directly
  as the product of their masses and inversely
  as the square of the distance tbat separates
  them on newtons law of gravitation was
  reared the great mathematical structure of dy-
  namical astronomy which concerns itself with
  the exact calculation of a planets orbit as dis-
  turbed by the attractive influences of every
  other planet or satellite

    we have noticed a tendency in our corres-
  pondents to confuse issues by entering into
  complex theoretical arguments to make sci-
  ence a difficult subject to comprehend ia a mis-
  take and an unnecessary  mistake nearly
  every scientific law can be simply explained in
  simple terms and every fundamental law is in-
  trinsically a simple one it is primarily the
  object ot this magazine to make aviation sci-
  ence simple to the layman who is interested in
  the developments of the present day and those
  of the future we therefore ask our corres-
  pondents to state their ideas in as simple lan-
  guage as possible so that their letters will be of
  universal interest to readers of all stages of
  scientific knowledge-editor

i do not think that it hurt anything to get the
milter cleared upr however

  now as to major wo a bevan who like-
wise was stirred up by the same letter it
was intended to stir things up and seems to
have succeeded beyond all hopes as to his
explanation of the lift ou the wings of a plane
it is evident that we do not conflict as to facts
whether his terminology see the september
number was misleading i think would have to
be left to the readers it is not a very vital
point anyway

  but major bevan in his reply in the no-
vember number states that my contention as to
the superiority of the united states in civil
and military aviation is too absurd to call for
much comment i believe it can be shown that
if one is to go by the facts which seem to be
available major bevans remark like the re-
port of mark twains death is considerably ex-
aggerated let us take the military aspect
first

  at present the number of military planes in
commission in the united states is kept con-
fidential as it should be but tbe aircraft year
book shows that  engines for military use
were produced during  in   mili-
tary engines were produced i do not know
how many of the latter are still in commission
it is safe  think to assume that  to
 in all are still extant  planes were
produced being  per cent less than in 
in - it would thus appear that about
 planes were produced in the last two
years then we have put out of military use not
less than  engines and  planes what
disposition has been made of these engines and
planes resulting in what present strength is as
said a secret of tire war department like-
wise our resources in planes and engines al-
ready on band before that

  the leipzig illustrierte zcitung gives for the
military strength of the various nations r ranee
 england  and then on a rapidly
descending scale to portugal with  innce
the article in which these figures were given
was written for the purpose of showing the air
supremacy of these nations over germany it is
not probable that they represent a minimum
unless authentic contradiction can be produced
i believe that one is justified in believing that
the united states stands about on a par wit
france and much above the rest certainly at
least in any number available for invasion by
carrier ships or other known means

  now as to civil aviation on november nd
 according to the department of com-
merce there were in the united states 
licensed planes and  identified planes a
total of  the latest figures available for
europe  show the highest number of

aies in italy with  france is next with
 germany which major bevan specifically
cites for superiority had  to reach civil
equality with us germany during  would
have had to produce nearly  planes can
major bevan produce any figures to prove that
she did i think not especially when foreign
aeronautical news of tbe department of com-
merce shows that during  all europe pro-
duced only  planes of all type-this de-

ficiency laid by authorities to the effect of gov-
ernment subsidies judging from his purely ner-
sonal observations and conclusions capt von

hoffman-ostenhoff an austrian air magnate re-
cently stated that another year would pot
america in the van he may have meant over
all europe

  recently two aircraft manufacturers one a
german and the other an american toured the
air activities of one anothers countries and
their views printed in tbe same air magazine
agreed that america is superior in general in
flying personnel in flying schools and in up-
to-date-ness of methods

  three items in at wonder stoiiks for
march are pertinent at the foot of nagc 
it is stated that while europe is still far ahead
of us in military aviation which may he true
for all of europe i said any other country
our aviation in general is on a sounder basis
the article at the foot of  is important and
major young assistant secretary for aero-
nautics of the department of commerce says
that the united states is unquestionably the
leading nation of the world so far as aviation
development is concerned and among other
things that while the mileage of transport flight
in oermanv during  was only 
miles in this country it was about 
miles i grant that definite figures under such
rapidly changing conditions are hard to pin
down but i think enough has been shown to
prove that if my statement was in error it was
only by six months or a year at worst and
that if as he states i evidently know nothing
whatever about the aviation civil and military

that if as he states i evidently know nothing

session of extremely valuable information which
ignorance without as the negro preacher said
is so far a dark secret to the  s depart-
ment of commerce to the aeronautical chamber
of commerce of america to the lllustrierte
zeitung and to various and sundry aviation
manufacturers and officials he really would
seem better advised to set us right with it
than to nuke sweeping assertions of general
showing wherein

of course there are a great many important
factors entering into the question of potential
air defense or offense besides the mere statistics
of planes and types of planes for instance up-to-
datc-ncss in quality of planes irrespective of
numbers-for a few slightly superior planes
can go through a great number of slightly in-
ferior ones like unto an eagle through a flock
of bens as i had occasion to note during the
big war-possible volume of production and the

 with which it can be arrived at resources
basically trained personnel and all tt but

sjed

of bat

when such factors are analyzed i believe they
will be found to lean mostly in our favor in
this present year i stick to my original state-
ment-that had mitcbeus policies received re-
cognition we should right now have been out
millions of dollars spent for now obsolete planes
which wc would have traded for an unguessable

suantity of fear and hatred instilled into the
uropcan mind by preparations on our part
which europe could interpret only as warlike

tbe said european s ind has a curiously
logical way of concluding that when any na-
tion sets out for superiority in a branch of
arms it must have its eye on something or
other definite to be done with that branch
that is why france which has vigorously
seized the european air supremacy along with
a consonant development of other military
branches is now so general an object of sus-
picion and fear when not actual hatred

it appears to me to be a moral obligation
incumbent upon those who are pushing aviation
and profiting or expecting to profit thereby
to use every effort to see that it is not used
ny more than necessary to furtjr inter-
national fear and hatred

it has been acknowlgeed for many years
that published statistics on military and naval

strengths are not entirely reliable guides when
we study the comparative strengths of the air
forces of the foremost nations we face great

difficulty in estimating relative armaments for
example though germany is technically limited
in tbe size and number of the airplanes she
may build and the numerical strength of her
armed forces she may circumventa these restric-
tions by intensive and varied training of each
military unit and by increasing  the general
efficiency of each weapon whether it be a battle
cruiser or an airplane

though it is an open secret that all europe
is and has been arming for war since  it
is a mistake to believe that the united states is
the cause of such preparations europe is an
armed camp but her enemies are within her own
borders the geographical position and vast
boundaries of this country allied with our
gigantic mechanism for production of arms
or airplanes make the possibilities of inter-
continental warfare vcr remote it is true that
in time these geographical defenses will be low-
ered by modern air transportation and here we
agree with mr endersby when he says that the
air-fleet of today is obsolete tomorrow

perhaps our readers would like to express
their opinion on a matter on which even experts
disagree should the government follow col
mitchells advice and build a large fleet of air-
planes now or should it concentrate on avi-
ation research work with a view to enlarging
its forces when necessity arrives such an
opinion from the readers of this magazine will

as explained in our february issue in
answer to mr bede a television image is com-
posed of impulses which may be magnified elec-
trically but their number may not be added
to in order to bring out more details the
same would be found true of tbe images re-
ceived by our eyes if there were any way to
amplify them they are lacking in details below
a certain point if we put a white speck on a
dark background and back away until we can
no louger sec it we afind a point where tbe
light reflected from it is not enough to produce
an effect upon our eyes though they still re-
ceive it only a lens or other optical apparatus
which picks up more light than our eyes can
will make tbe speck again visible at this dis-
tance

no matter bow large a train of lenses we
use there is a natural limit to magnifying
power due to the fact that a wave of light is
about - of an inch in length and an ob-
ject much smaller than this is not capable of
affecting the light wave perceptibly tbe light
which we can see is limited to a very narrow
range of wavelengths probably determined by
the sixe of the molecules in the sensitive back-

 round the retina of our eyes which it af-
 ects chemically

 theoretically this light wave is a radio wave
 only a very short one-about one two-millionth
 of a meter long as the wavelength to which
 radio apparatus will respond is determined by
 its size we leave to mr hess the problem of
 winding a coil of the size suitable for tuning
 in the wavelength of light-editor

 auiation mechanics has been intended pri-
 marily as a handbook for amateur aviators and
 constructors of planes and sliders the man
 who is desirous of building his own ship will
 find this book an indispensable  aid all aero-
 nautical terms used are described fully and
 each part of tbe plane is covered adequately in
 text and illustrations so that the lay man is
 enabled to proceed without difficulty there is
 an abundance of diagrams and photographs
 visualizing each step in the procedure of build-

 ing an airplane or glider several types of
 ships are covered a man-carrying glider a
 single passenger monoplane a single passenger

 a pilot must know his engine so the author
 has devoted a cbapted to the modern aircraft
 engine with illustrations showing the internal
 construction and bow tke various parts func-
 tion practical construction hints is the
 title of another chapter it contains some choice
 biu of information which every builder will wel-
 come nor do we overlook the interesting de-
 partment elaborately illustrated showing all
 the latest types of airplanes and dirigibles
 gliders and balloons this book is a real bow-
 to-make-it book it tells and illustrates each
 step in building an airplane for your own use
 tbe designs given are standard ones and the
 planes described have actually been built and
 successfully flown

in short as you must have concluded by
now that we are very enthusiastic about this
new book which does well what it set out to do
-to tell the reader how to actually build and
fly a plane or glider

continued from page 

     alicia leaned forward eagerly made as
  though to arise and greet her friends
  fry his love for her shining in his eyes
  reached out his arms to her

    but the scientist was due for a rude
  awakening two powerful martians
  standing beside the carriage thrust them-
  selves between the girl and her lover
  and a heavy scowl settled over the al-
  ready stern features of the kor of osin

    neither fry nor randolph understood
  the reason for this demonstration so as
  the scientist made another effort to reach
  the girl he was amazed and infuriated
  when at a sharp order from the person-
  age in the carriage the two powerful
  martians again seized him

    it was now that henry randolpli went
  into action hurling himself upon the two
  martians and bearing them to the ground
  others came and the huge earth-men
  fought them off their feet together he
  and fry soon cleared a space about them
  but their enjoyment of it was brief more
  martian guardsmen joined in the struggle
  which could have but one ending the
  earth-men were overpowered

    there stood between the adventurers
  and the royal carriage a dozen tall mar-
  tian guardsmen whose attitude toward
  them while not threatening indicated be-
  yond doubt that they should not be per-
  mitted to approach the girl no harm liad
  been done them but they were given to
  understand that they were under a taboo
  with regard to contact with alicia

     fry turned to his friend he had seen
  no one else in the carriage but alicia and
  the kor of osin of whose identity he
  was of course ignorant

     this looks bad randolph i he cried
  what do you make of it

     it is strange admitted the other but
  theres nothing we can do perhaps wed
  better wait awhile and see what happens

     as the carriage moved away the scien-
  tist turned again jor one fleeting glimpse
  of the girl he loved he saw her white
  scared face for just a moment and then
  she was gone but he called out to her
  before the guardsmen could silence him

     whatever happens alicia he shouted
  we shall be working to aid you i love
  you darling

    and i love you leonard with my
  whole heart  called alicia at which the
  kor of osin bent toward her scowling
  his disapproval he had not understood
  her words but it displeased him that this
  woman from another world should hold
  speech with any but himself

    the moment the kors carriage moved
  away the martians who had piloted the
  adventurers to the city of hio made signs
  that they were to accompany him there
  was nothing to do but consent besides
  as they could not fail to observe he was
  openly friendly perhaps even sympathetic

     fry wished to re-enter the projectile
  but the martian shook his head at this
  he smiled in friendliness however as he
  stepped between him and the craft while
  the guardsmen about it tightened their
  lines

  resigning themselves to their guide
  because there seemed to be nothing
  else they could do they awaited his pleas-
  ure they were joined immediately by
  another youthful martian of about the
  type of the first both wore uniforms
  and the earth-men concluded they were
  acting in some official capacity

  the pilot easy of manner introduced
  his friend ken mahu who in turn after
  bowing low in acknowledgment presented
  by name the pilot who had escorted them

continued from page 

into the city he was ken jari thus the
four -men constituted a group that at-
tracted attention from the populace as
they entered a carriage and were driven
away

ken jari and ken mahu now took
their charges to the same institution
in which alicia had been questioned on
her arrival this was the por lito a
place of scientific study and learning a
university unlike anything they had ever
seen

  in the por lito the earth-men were
presented to horo the aged scientist who
liad discovered the amazing fact that
alicia had come from another world but
if leonard fry had known that it was
horo who had been responsible for the
incident on the landing field and for
alicias detention by the kor of osin he
could not have accepted the offer of the
patriarchs assistance as he did it was
well for the adventurers that they could
not yet know that horo master of sci-
ences and high priest of osin had in duty
to his sovereign reported the coming of
a maiden frpm another world and had
pointed out to him how it was the ful-
filment of a prophecy and tradition that
bad comc down through the ages

  horo it was who headed the institution
of the por lito and it was he who now
undertook in the interest of further sci-
entific discovery to evolve a method of
intelligible communication with the visi-
tors from the earth which was known
on mars  or turinia as sjor for
had not the kor of osin ordered the
quickest progress in this direction of
which horo and his staff of instructors
were capable and was not the sjorian
maiden already a student at the por lito

  horo accordingly welcomed the earth-
men to the por lito where he now
seemed as one transformed revitalized
his eagerness brightened his eyes and
quickened his step hc-had lived through
many generations but this experience was
the greatest of his lifetime the prophecy
had actually come true-human beings
from another world had come to turinia i
it was the greatest day of his long life

  ken jari and ken mahu who were
flying captains and whose title of ken
was the proudest possession of any young
martian as the earth-men were to dis-
cover found quarters for the sjorian visi-
tors in the building itself but horo
who had given them brief instructions
could not bring himself to leave the
earth-men so he joined the group and
made certain that his charges were com-
fortably disposed the old man lingered
there with them for some time although
he could not yet communicate a single
thought to these daring adventurers who
m his opinion had eclipsed anything ever
yet attempted by any men of any planet
in all the solar system

  at last however horo bowed himself
out of the comfortable quarters in which
kdi jari and ken mahu had established
the visitors and the earth-men were
alone

  randolph looked searchingly at his
friend as the martians left them and was
glad to note that fry seemed less wor-
ried since meeting horo he himself
had also experienced a change in feeling
both ken jari and ken mahu hand-
some courteous fellows had shown
marked friendliness and horo had been
positively enthusiastic over his contact
with them

 the mirrtians pronounce this with a hissing
sound as though they were pronouncing george
with an s in front

leonard observed randolph  i
dont think these people mean any harm
whatever

  none to u apparently was frys
answer but i am uneasy about alicia
that man in the carriage with her evi-
dently is a personage of some kind may-
be a king he made it plain enough that
he did not wish her to have anything to
do with us but and he smiled in spite
of his anxiety you heard what the dear
girl said to me i and that is something
to inspire the hope that we may finally
understand what it all means

   if we could only talk their language
or they could talk ours suggested ran-
dolph i am sure they would tell us

   yes of course but theres no pos-
sibility of communicating with anybody
however dr leonard fry famous sci-
entist and scholar though lie was in his
own world could not yet appreciate the
amazing -resourcefulness of one horo
master of sciences and high priest of
osin who had even that night made
plans for their intensive education

chapter ix
their first lesson

ken jari and ken mahu returned
within the hour which was at sun-
set they greeted the men from
sjor with smiles and invited them to
leave the apartment

   the earth-men willingly assented for
they believed they had two friends in the
flying captains who had shown them only
kindness and courtesy true ken jari
had forbidden them to return to the pro-

etift but it was easy to understand that
did so because he was under orders

   the four set out in a carriage that was
waiting on the grounds and in which
horo master of sciences and high priest
of osin was already seated ready to
accompany them

   the martians or turinians took the
earth-men for a tour of the city the
streets were wide perfectly smooth and
laid out with no square corners at in-
tersections vegetation grew in small
park areas at frequent intervals but most
of it was small due dr fry guessed in
commenting on it to his friend to a
shortage of water

  the architecture they found was
simple rather than elaborate the mar-
tians had long since adopted the zoning
plan here was a section apparently de-
voted to business and there another that
was strictly residential but the earth-
men observed other business sections as
they drove about the city they were
smaller than the central one through
which they had passed and were ob-
viously devoted to neighborhood service

   the city of hio was not large and the
carriage was swift so the visitors had
soon seen nearly everything of general
interest in the community the most im-
pressive thing the earth-men noted was
the total absence of slum sections the
architecture everywhere was on the same
scale and varied only in design every-
where the streets were the same remark-
ably smooth and wide with an abundance
of gradual curves and small parks at in-
tersections

  meanwhile horo had been active he
liad sat between the earth-men and had
talked incessantly naming various ob-
jects as they toured the city and the
earth-men as eager to learn as horo
was to teach paid strict attention and
busied themselves with their notebooks
they had mastered a number of words in
the turinian language by the time the

continued from page 

  drive was concluded and they returned to
  the por uto for dinner 

    the meal was served in the apartment
  to which the visitors had been assigned
  horo and the two flying captains sat with
  their guests and as before the master
  of sciences and high priest of osin con-
  tinued to teach them naming various ob-
  jects such as the dishes served and the
  utensils employed

    night approached and horo master
  night was approaching and horo master
  astronomer led the way to the observa-
  tory

    the massive telescope the largest dr
  fry had ever seen attracted his attention
  at oncc but horo before permitting him
  to satisfy his curiosity for a peep into the
  instrument called his attention to a plan-
  etarium he followed the same method
  he had employed with alicia indicating
  mars or turinia and then the earth or
  sjor as they revolved around the sun

    horo also named the other planets and
  his pupils inscribed the names in their
  notebooks as the patriarch nodded his
  approval in this way they were obtaining
  fragments of the turinian tongue the
  language seemed simple none of the
  words horo had used were long and the
  language itself was apparently liquid for
  no gutturals had yet been heard from
  horo or the flying captains

    at last the gigantic telescope engaged
  their attention dr fry himself a famous
  astronomer and physicist marveled at the
  progress made by the turinians his re-
  spect for horo master of sciences and
  high priest of osin deepened as the aged
  man swung the great telescope over a
  wide arc of the heavens and identified
  various constellations

    with the small planetarium at his side
  horo instructed dr fry in his first
  lesson in martian astronomy indicating
  the earth or sjor low near the horizon
  he swung the telescope full upon it the
  earth-man gasped at what he saw-a
  glorious planet now the evening star
  shining with remarkable brilliance over a
  wide area of its surface and with a faint
  outline of darker regions that he was
  actually able to identify as the continents

    dr fry called to randolph

    come and sec this he urged there
  is the outline of the western hemisphere
  of the earth one can really identify
  both continents

    randolph was no less amazed although
  the martian skill in astronomy held the
  greater lure for the scientist

    both men gasped as alicia had done
  when ken jari at a word from horo
  brought a chart into the observatory on
  which were shown photographic repro-
  ductions of the earths surface here
  indeed was astronomy in the -fullest
  sense

    horo to whom the heavens apparently
  were as familiar as the city in which he
  lived touched the controls of the massive
  telescope and brought it to bear on various
  planets there was no need for identi-
  fication so far as dr fry was concerned
  he knew them quite as well as did horo
  but he had never seen them to such ad-
  vantage the martian telescope was a
  marvel

   the evening wore on and horo and
 dr fry drawn together by the strongest
 bond men like themselves could ever
 know reveled in their silent study of the
 universe galaxies millions of light-years
 distant were revealed to the wondering
 visitor he was now permitted to view
 things at which in theory he had only
 guessed
