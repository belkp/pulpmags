television hill a serial in two parts
part i by george mclociard with the coming
of the new inventions recently completed in the
matter of practical television interest in the sub-
ject has taken a new impetus but this is not
merely a television story this is one of the
most thrilling exciting scientific fiction stories it
has been our good fortune to offer in our maga-
zine we must let this story talk for itself

the man who annexed the moon by

bob olsen we dont hear from mr olsen often
but that is obviously because he will offer a story
really worth while or he wont send us any
the moon has been written about a great deal
but that does not take away one bit from the
unusualness of this tale for this author is with-
out a doubt an excellent writer of scientific fiction
with plenty of imagination and special and gen-
eral knowledge

the purple plague by russell hays de-
spite our late war to end war there is much
thought given to possible warfare of the future
chemists have now become an established entity
in the scheme of things how practicable the
ideas suggested by this author might prove re-
mains to be seen but he has certainly written an
instructive piece of fiction of absorbing interest

bees from borneo by will h gray the
work of the apiarist is important for the bee
is one of the wonders of the world the very
limitations that control them are most interest-
ing for there are many variations among them
and the queen bee is one of the miracles of the
insect world the author of the tide-projectile
transportation company ltd gives us here an
ingenious story of unusual interest

cosmic power by j c dare in the struggle
for supremacy between money and science to
whom would go the spoils this short story

the story of motors

                      by t oconor sloane phd

any centuries ago there was a grecian mathema-
tician and scientist named hero or heron who is
always called hero or heron of alexandria he
is supposed to have lived between  b c and 
a d a good deal is known about him although
naturally most of his works have perished he was
a mathematician of considerable ability and of very
high standing for the era he lived in heros fountain the in-
teresting apparatus so often exhibited by which water is para-
doxically made to rise in a jet above its own level is more or less
an amusing puzzle at first sight but the achievement of this
great philosopher which is of extreme interest at the present day
is heros steam engine it is a fact that some two thousand years
ago a real steam engine was made and it will be found described
in many text books this steam engine was a reaction turbine
and the turbine may be taken as the most advanced type of
modern steam engine naturally heros engine is a mere toy
but it does involve the turbine principle and uses directly the
principle of reaction which is employed in rocket propulsion of
automobiles and planes and this too we treat as an imperfect
novelty when applied to anything except fireworks but the old
greek philosopher was eighteen or twenty centuries ahead of us
for reaction may yet play an important part in propulsion

  when engineers began to build direct pressure steam engines
the weight of the atmosphere was used to produce the down-
ward pressure on the piston for they started at once with the
conception of the vertical cylinder and piston this of course
was long before the days of piston rings of which the automobilist
hears so much there was a groove in the piston to be filled with
packing and water was sometimes kept on the top of the piston
to keep it airtight steam was generated in a boiler and entering
the cylinder below the piston forced it up to the top of its stroke
all the steam had to do was to overcome the atmospheric pres-
sures and in some of the old beam pumping engines the pump
rod was heavily weighted so as to help draw the piston up against
the pressure of the air when the top of the stroke was reached
the steam valve was closed and a jet of water was driven into
the cylinder this condensed the steam and the atmospheric
pressure forced the piston down again to the bottom

  it was a very poor arrangement because the piston and cylinder
of a steam engine should be kept as hot as possible here both
were directly cooled but this was the first conception of a low
pressure steam engine then engineers went on to construct high
pressure engines of various types in which the steam after doing
its work was allowed to escape into the air and in these early
engines which were often of considerable size and of definitely
low speed the valves were sometimes opened and shut by a
workman or boy it is said that one juvenile valve tender man-
aged to connect his valve handles with strings to the engine so
as to make it self-operating thus indicating a direct advance in

the machine then the next step came along the steam from
the engine exhaust was admitted into a separate condensing vessel
where it was acted on by a water jet or by refrigerating tubes
so that the steam was condensed outside of the cylinder and the
heat in the cylinder was maintained this was watts great in-
vention  in its essence it is the basis of the modern low pressure
engine

  the great object to be attained in all types of heat engine steam
gasoline or any other type is to cover as large a range of tem-
perature as possible the hotter the actuating gas is at the one
extremity of its action and the colder it is at the other the more
economical is the action

  this is a rough statement of the second law of thermodynamics
in order to increase this range of efficient action within a few
years experiments have been made with mercury doing the work
of steam its vapor is very much hotter than that of water at
the same pressures and this on the face of it suggests an economy

  the economy of the gasoline or heavy oil diesel engine is due
to the fact that the temperature at its maximum is that of a
burning combustible far up on the heat scale many times hotter
than steam these engines properly called internal combustion
engines have made the airplane possible the second law of
thermodynamics may be said to be the agent that carries air-
planes across continents and around the world and that drives
the dirigibles every steam engine is subject to it for steam is a
gas but the law does the most advantageous work or rather
operates under the most advantageous conditions in the internal
combustion engine because there we use the temperature of
burning hydrocarbons directly instead of the normally much
lower temperature of steam far lower even at high pressures

  the old time low pressure steam engines in which cold water
was injected into the cylinder with every down stroke worked
most disadvantageous- on account of the cooling of the cylinder
and curiously enough today we repeat that very blunder in
cooling the cylinders of internal combustion engines with water
or air currents for the advanced type of steam engine and for
the last suggestions for the propulsion of airplanes and auto-
mobiles we go back to hero the old philosopher of perhaps 
centuries ago

  it is curious to observe the efforts of mankind to develop the
heat engine  the first steam engine of perhaps  years ago
was a turbine-the mauritania of the present time with turbine
engines held the transatlantic speed record for years the latest
experiments in driving cars and airplanes have been in the use
of the reaction of moving gases according to newtons second
law of motion this principle was what was used to drive heros
steam engine also and in the early steam engine centuries after
heros with cylinder and piston the error was perpetrated of
directly cooling the cylinder with water this error is per-
petuated in the automobile engine of today
the prince of

by jack williamson

author of the metal man the green girl etc

jfjven the lick observatory which was built at the summit of mount wil-
-j son  feet high at tremendous expense cannot satisfy the astronomers
an observatory that would reach about twice that height such as the one built
by the scientist in this story would be more likely to hit the mark certainly
the views obtained of the moon and even of mars through our present appar-
ently gigantic telescopes undoubtedly call for a higher observatory fitted with
a more enormous telescope which will some day be established what may be
seen then cannot be foretold with certainty but thats where the imagination-
with scientific visualizations-enters mr williamsons writing is not new to
our readers at that this story is sure to make stronger friends for him and
add many new ones to his ever fast-growing list of admirers

chapter i

ten million eagles reward

    space flier found drifting with two hundred dead
  notorious interplanetary pirate-prince of space-believed
  to have committed ghastly outrage

mr william windsor a hard-

headed grim-visaged newspaperman of
forty stood nonchalantly on the moving
walk that swept him briskly down fifth
avenue he smiled with pardonable
pride as he listened to the raucous magnetic speakers
shouting out the phrases that drew excitcd mobs to the
robot vending machines which sold the yet damp news
strips of printed shorthand bill had written the ac-
count of the outrage he had risked his life in a mad
flight upon a hurtling sunship to get his concise story to
new york in time to beat his competitors discovering
the inmost details of whatever was puzzling or important
or exciting in this day of  regardless of risk to
life or limb and elucidating those details to the ten mil-
lion avid readers of the great daily newspaper the
herald-sun was the prime passion of bills life

  incidentally the reader might be warned at this point
that bill is not properly speaking a character in this
narrative he is only an observer the real hero is that
amazing person who has chosen to call himself the
prince of space this history is drawn from bills
diary which he kept conscientiously expecting to write
a book of the great adventure

  bill stepped off the moving sidewalk by the corner
vending machine dropped a coin in the slot and received
a copy of the damp shorthand strip delivered fresh from
the presses by magnetic tube lie read his story standing
in a busy street that rustled quietly with the whir of
moving walks and the barely audible drone of the

thousands of electrically driven heliocars which spun
smoothly along on rubber-tired wheels or easily lifted
themselves to skimming flight upon whirling helicopters

    heliographic advices from the moon patrol flier
  avenger state that the sunship helicon was found
  today at  universal time drifting two thou-
  sand miles off the lunar lane the locks were open
  air had escaped all on board were frozen and dead
  casualties include captain stormburg the crew of
   officers and men and  passengers of whom
   were women the helicon was bound to los
  angeles from the lunarium health resorts at tycho
  on the moon it is stated that the bodies were
  barbarously torn and mutilated as if the most
  frightful excesses had been perpetrated upon them
  the cargo of the sunship had been looted the most
  serious loss is some thousands of tubes of the new
  radioactive metal vitalium said to have been worth
  nearly a million eagles

    a crew was put aboard the helicon from the
  avenger her valves were closed and she will be
  brought under her own motor tubes to the inter-
  planetary base at miami florida where a more
  complete official examination will be made no
  attempt has been made to identify the bodies of
  the dead the passenger list is printed below

    military officials are inclined to place blame for
  the outrage upon the notorious interplanetary out-
  law who calls himself the prince of space on
  several occasions the prince has robbed sunships
  of cargoes of vitalium though he has never before
  committed so atrocious a deed as the murder of
  scores of innocent passengers it is stated that the
  engraved calling card which the prince is said
  always to present to the captain of a captured sun-
  ship was not found on the wreck

amazing stories

     further details will be given the public as soon as
  it is possible to obtain them

    the rewards offered for the prince of space
  taken dead or alive have been materially increased
  since the outrage the total offered by the interna-
  tional confederation interplanetary transport
  lunar mining corporation sunship corporation
  vitalium power company and various other
  societies corporations newspapers and individuals
  is now ten million eagles

  ten million eagles bill exclaimed that would
mean a private heliocar and a long long vacation in the
south seas

  he snorted folded up the little sheet and thrust it into
his green silk tunic as he sprang nimbly upon the mov-
ing sidewalk

  what chance have i to see the prince of space
about him the slender spires of widely spaced build-
ings rose two hundred stories into a blue sky free from
dust or smoke the white sun glinted upon thousands
of darting heliocars driven by silent electricity he
threw back his head gazed longingly up at an amazing
structure that rose beside him-at a building that was
the architectural wonder of the twenty-second century

begun in  trainors tower had been finished
hardly a year a slender white finger of aluminum
and steel alloy it rose twelve thousand feet above the
canyons of the metropolis architects had laughed six
years ago when dr trainor who had been an obscure
western college professor had returned from a vaca-
tion trip to the moon and announced his plans for a
tower high enough to carry an astronomical observatory
giving mountain conditions a building five times as
high as any in existence it was folly they said and
certain skeptics inquired how an impecunious professor
would get funds to put it up the world had been mildly
astonished when the work began it was astounded when
it was known that the slender tower had safely reached
its full height of nearly two and a half miles a beauti-
ful thing it was in its slim strength-girder-work of
glistening white metal near theground and but a slender
white cylinder for the upper thousands of feet of its
amazing height

  the world developed a hungry curiosity about the
persons who had the privilege of ascending in a swift
elevator to the queer many-storied cylindrical build-
ing atop the astounding tower bill had spent many
hours in the little waiting room before the locked door
of the elevator shaft-bribes to the guard had been a
heavy drain upon a generous expense account but not
even bribery had won him into the sacred elevator

  he had given his paper something however of the
persons who passed sometimes through the waiting room
there was dr trainor of course a mild bald man
with kindly blue eyes and a slow patient smile and
paula his vivaciously beautiful daughter a slim small
girl with amazingly expressive eyes she had been with
her father on the voyage to the moon scores of others
had passed through they ranged from janitors and care-
takers to some of the worlds most distinguished astrono-
mers and solar engineers-but they were uniformly re-
ticent about what went on in trainors tower

  and there was mr cain-the mysterious mr
cain as bill had termed him he had seen him twice
a slender man tall and wiry lean of face with dark
quizzical eyes the reporter had been able to learn

nothing about him-and what bill could not unearth was
a very deep secret it seemed that sometimes cain was
about trainors tower and that more often he was not
it was rumored that he had advanced funds for build-
ing it and for carrying on the astronomical research for
which it was evidently intended

  impelled by habit bill sprang off the moving walk
as he glided past trainors tower he was standing
watching the impassive guard when a man came past
into the street the man was mr cain with a slight
smile upon the thin dark face that was handsome in a
stern masculine sort of way bill started pricked up his
ears so to speak and resolved not to let this mysterious
young man out of sight until he knew something about
him

  to bills vast astonishment mr cain advanced to-
ward him with a quick decisive step and a speculative
gleam lurking humorously in his dark eyes he spoke
without preamble

  i believe you are mr william windsor a leading
representative of the herald-sun

  true and you are mr cain-the mysterious mr
cain

  the tall young man smiled pleasantly

  yes in fact i think the mysterious is due to you

but mr windsor-

  just call me bill

  - believe that you are desirous of admission to

the tower

  ive done my best to get in

  i am going to offer you the facts you want about it
provided you will publish them only with my permis-
sion

  thanks bill agreed you can trust me

  i have a season trainors tower was built for a
purpose that purpose is going to require some pub-
licity very shortly you are better able to supply that
publicity than any other man in the world

  i can do it-provided-

  i am sure that our cause is one that will enlist your
enthusiastic support you will be asked to do nothing
dishonorable

  mr cain took a thin white card from his pocket
scrawled rapidly upon it and handed it to bill who
read the words admit bearer cain

  present that at the elevator at eight tonight ask to
be taken to dr trainor

  mr cain walked rapidly away with his lithe springy
step leaving bill standing looking at the card rather
astounded

  at eight that night a surprised guard let bill into the
waiting room the elevator attendant looked at the
card

  yes dr trainor is up in the observatory

  the car shot up carrying bill on the longest vertical
trip on earth it was minutes before the lights on the
many floors of the cylindrical building atop the tower
were flashing past them the elevator stopped the
door swung open and bill stepped out beneath the crys-
tal dome of an astronomical observatory

  he was on the very top of trainors tower

  the hot stars shone hard and clear through a metal-
ribbed dome of polished vitrolite through the lower
panels of the transparent wall bill could see the city
spread below him-a mosaic of fine points of light scat-
tered with the colored winking eyes of electric signs it
was so far below that it seemed a city in miniature
the prince of space



  slanting through the crystal dome was the huge black
barrel of a telescope with ponderous equatorial mount-
ing electric motors whirred silently in its mechanism
and little lights winked about it a man was seated at the
eyepiece-he was dr trainor bill saw-he was
dwarfed by the huge size of the instrument

  there was no other person in the room  other in-
strument of importance the massive bulk of the tele-
scope dominated it

  trainor rose and came to meet bill a friendly smite
spread over his placid face blue eyes twinkled with
mild kindliness the subdued light in the room glisten-
ed on the bald dome of his head

  mr windsor of the herald-sun i suppose bill
nodded and produced a notebook i am very glad you
came i have something interesting to show you some-
thing on the planet mars

 what-

  no no questions please they can wait until you
see mr cain again

  reluctantly bill closed his notebook trainor seated
himself at the telescope and bill waited while he peered
into the tube and pressed buttons and moved bright
levers motors whirred and the great barrel swung
about

  now look trainor commanded

  bill took the seat and peered into the eyepiece he
saw a little circle of a curious luminous blue-blackness
with a smaller disk of light hanging in it slightly sway-
ing the disk was an ocherous red with darker
splotches and brilliantly white polar markings

  that is mars-as the ordinary astronomer sees it
trainor said now i will change eyepieces and you
will see it as no man has ever seen it except through this
telescope

  rapidly he adjusted the great instrument and bill
looked again

  the red disk had expanded enormously with great
increase of detail it had become a huge red globe with
low mountains and irregularities of surface plainly visi-
ble the prismatic polar caps stood out with glaring
whiteness dark green-gray patches splotched burned
orange deserts and thin green-black lines-the contro-
versal canals of mars-ran straight across the planet
from white caps toward the darker equatorial zone in-
tersecting at little round greenish dots

  look carefully trainor said what do you see
in the edge of the upper right quadrant near the center
of the disk and just above the equator

  bill peered saw a tiny round dot of blue-it was very
small but sharply edged perfectly round bright against
the dull red of the planet

   i see a little blue spot

  im afraid you see the death-sentence of humanity

ordinarily bill might have snorted-newspaper-
men are apt to become exceedingly skeptical but
there was something in the gravity of trainors words
and in the strangeness of what he had seen through the
giant telescope in the tower observatory that made him
pause

   theres been a lot of fiction bill finally remarked
in the last couple of hundred years wells old book
the war of the worlds for example general theory
seems to be that the martians are drying up and want
to steal water but i never really-

  i dont know what the motive may be trainor said

but we know that mars has intelligent life-the canals
are proof of that and we have excellent reason to be-
lieve that that life knows of us and intends us no good
you remember the enbers expedition

  yes in  enbers was a fool who thought that
if a sunship could go to the moon it might go to mars
just as well he must have been struck by meteorites
there is no reason why enbers might not have
reached mars in  said trainor the heliographic
dispatches continued until he was well over half way
there was no trouble then we have very good reason
to think that he landed that his return was prevented by
intelligent beings  mars we know that they are
using what they learned from his captured sunship to
launch an interplanetary expedition of their own
and that blue spot has something to do with it
we think so but i have authority to tell you noth-
ing more as the situation advances we will have need
for newspaper publicity we want you to take charge
of that mr cain of course is in supreme charge
you will remember your word to await his permission
to publish anything

  trainor turned again to the telescope

  with a little clatter the elevator stopped again at the
entrance door of the observatory a slender girl ran
from it across to the man at the telescope

  my daughter paula mr windsor said trainor
paula trainor was an exquisite being her large
eyes glowed with a peculiar shade of changing brown
black hair was shingled close to her shapely head her
face was small elfinly beautiful the skin almost tran-
parent but it was the eyes that were remarkable in
their lustrous depths sparkled mingled essence of child-
ish innocence intuitive age-old wisdom and quick in-
telligence-intellect that was not coldly reasonable but
effervescent flashing to instinctively correct conclusions
it was an oddly baffling face revealing only the mood of
the moment one could not look at it and say that its
owner was good or bad indulgent or stern gentle or
hard it could be if she willed the perfect mirror of
the moments thought-but the deep stream of her char-
acter flowed unrevealed behind it

  bill looked at her keenly noted all that engraved the
girl in the notebook of his memory but in her he saw
only an interesting feature story

  dads been telling you about the threatened invasion
from mars eh she inquired in a low husky voice
liquid and delicious the most thrilling thing isnt it
arent we lucky to know about it and to be in the fight
against it-instead of going on like all the rest of the
world not dreaming there is danger

  bill agreed with her

  think of it  we may even go to mars to fight em
on their own ground

  remember paula trainor cautioned dont tell
mr windsor too much

  all right dad

  again the little clatter of the elevator mr cain had
come into the observatory a tall slender young man
with a quizzical smile and eyes dark and almost as enig-
matic as paulas

  bill watching the vivacious girl saw her smile at
cain he saw her quick flush her unconscious tremor
he guessed that she had some deep feeling for the man
but he seemed unaware of it he merely nodded to the
girl glanced at dr trainor and spoke briskly to bill
excuse me mr win-er bill but i wish to see dr


amazing stories

trainor alone we will communicate with you when it
seems necessary in the meanwhile i trust you to for-
get what you have seen here tonight and what the
doctor has told you good evening

  bill of necessity stepped upon the elevator five
minutes later he left trainors tower glancing up
from the vividly bright bustling street with its moving
ways and darting heliocars he instinctively expected to
see the starry heavens that had been in view from the
observatory

  but a heavy cloud like a canopy of yellow silk in the
light that shone upon it from the city hung a mile above
the upper thousands of feet of the slender tower were
out of sight above the clouds

  after breakfast next morning bill bought a shorthand
news strip from a robot purveyor in amazement and
some consternation he read

prince of space raids trainors tower

    last night hidden by the clouds that hung above
  the city the daring interplanetary outlaw the self-
  styled prince of space suspected of the helicon
  outrage raided trainors tower dr trainor his
  daughter paula and a certain mr cain are thought
  to have been abducted since they are reported to be
  missing this morning

    it is thought that the raiding ship drew herseif
  against the tower and used her repulsion rays to
  cut through the walls openings sufficiently large to
  admit the body of a man were found this morning
  in the metal outer wall it is said

    there can be no doubt that the raider was the
  prince of space since a card engraved with that
  title was left upon a table this is the first time the
  pirate has been known to make a raid on the surface
  of the earth-or so near it as the top of trainors
  tower

     considerable alarm is being felt as a result of this
  and the helicon outrage of yesterday stimulated
  by the reward of ten million eagles energetic
  efforts will be made on the part of the moon patrol
  to run down this notorious character

chapter ii
bloodhounds of space

two days later bill jumped from a landing helio-
car presented his credentials as special correspond-
ent and was admitted to the lakehurst base of the
moon patrol nine slender sunships lay at the side of
the wide high-fenced field just in front of their sheds
in the brilliant morning sunlight they scintillated like
nine huge octagonal ingots of polished silver

  these war-fliers of the moon patrol were eight-sided
about twenty feet in diameter arid a hundred long built
of steel and the new aluminum bronzes with broad vision
panels of heavy vitrolite each carried sixteen huge posi-
tive ray tubes these mammoth vacuum tubes operated
at enormous voltages from vitalium batteries were little
different in principle from the canal ray apparatus of
some centuries before their positive rays or streams
of atoms which had lost one or more electrons served to
drive the sunship by reaction-by the well-known prin-
ciple of the rocket motor

and the sixteen tubes mounted in twin rings about
each vessel served equally well as weapons when

focused on a point the impact-pressure of their rays
equaled that of the projectile from an ancient cannon
metal in the positive ray is heated to fusion living mat-
ter carbonized and burned away and the positive charge
carried by the ray is sufficient to electrocute any living
being in contact with it

  this moon patrol fleet of nine sunships was setting
out in pursuit of the prince of space the interplanetary
buccaneer who had abducted paula trainor and her
father and the enigmatic mr cain bill was going
aboard as special correspondent for the herald-sun

  on the night before the helicon the sunship which
had been attacked in space had been docked at miami
by the rescue crew put aboard from the avenger the
world had been thrown into a frenzy by the report of
the men who had examined the two hundred dead on
board

  blood sucked from helicon victims the loud
speakers were croaking mystery of lost sunship up-
sets world medical examination of the two hundred
corpses found on the wrecked space flier show that the
blood had been drawn from the bodies apparently
through curious circular wounds about the throat and
trunk every victim bore scores of these inexplicable
scars medical men will not attempt to explain how the
wounds might have been made

  in a more superstitious age it might be feared that
the prince of space is not man at all but a weird vamp-
ire out of the void and in fact it has been seriously
suggested that since the wounds observed could have
been made by no animal known on earth the fiend may
be a different form of life from another planet

  bill found captain brand leader of the expedition
just going on board the slender silver fury flagship of
the fleet of nine war-fliers he had sailed before with
this bluff hard-fighting guardsman of the space lanes
he was given a hearty welcome

  hunting down the prince is a good-sized undertak-
ing from all appearances bill observed

  rather big red-faced captain brand agreed we
have been after him seven or eight times in the past few
years-but i think his ship has never been seen he
must have captured a dozen commercial sunships

  you know i rather admire the prince- bill said
or did until that helicon affair but the way those pas-
sengers were treated is simply unspeakable blood
sucked out

  it is hard to believe that the prince is responsible for
that he has never needlessly murdered anyone before
-for all the supplies and money and millions worth of
vitalium he has taken and he has always left his en-
graved card-except on the helicon

  but anyhow we blow him to eternity on sight

  the air-lock was open before them and they walked
through and made their way along the ladder now hori-
zontal since the ship lay on her side to the bridge in
the bow bill looked alertly around the odd little room
with its vitrolite dome and glistening instruments while
captain brand flashed signals to the rest of the fleet for
sealing the locks and tuning the motor ray generators

  a red rocket flared from the fury white lances of
flame darted from the down-turned vacuum tubes as
one the nine ships lifted themselves from the level field
deliberately they upturned from horizontal to vertical
positions upward they flashed through the air with
slender white rays of light shooting back from the eight
rear tubes of each
the prince of space



  bill standing beneath the crystal dome felt the turn-
ing of the ship he felt the pressure of his feet against
the floor caused by acceleration and sat down in a con-
venient padded chair he watched the earth become a
great bowl with sapphire sea on the one hand and green-
brown land and diminishing smokeless city on the other
he watched the hazy blue sky become deepest azure
then black with a million still stars bursting out in pure
colors of yellow and red and blue he looked down
again and saw the earth become convex an enormous
bright globe mistily visible through haze or air and
cloud

  swiftly the globe drew away and a tiny ball of
silver half black half rimmed with blinding flame
sharply marked with innumerable round craters swam
into view beyond the misty edge of the globe-it was the
moon

  beyond them flamed the sun-a ball of blinding light
winged with a crimson sheet of fire-hurling quivering
lances of white heat through the vitrolite panels blind-
ing it was to look upon it unless one wore heavily tinted
goggles

  before them hung the abysmal blackness of space
with the canopy of cold hard stars blazing as tiny scintil-
lant points of light at an infinite distance away the
galaxy was a broad belt of silvery radiance about them
set with ten thousand many-colored jewels of fire
somewhere in the vastness of that void they sought a
daring man who laughed at society and called himself
the prince of space

  the nine ships spread out a thousand miles apart
flickering heliographs-swinging mirrors that reflected
the light of the sun-kept them in communication with
bluff captain brand while many men at telescopes
scanned the black star-studded sweep of space for the
pirate of the void

  days went by measured only by chronometer for the
winged white sun burned ceaselessly the earth had
shrunk to a little ball of luminous green bright on the
sunward side splotched with the dazzling white of cloud
patches and polar caps

  sometimes the black vitalium wings were spread to
catch the energy of the sun the sunship draws its
name from the fact that it is driven by solar power it
utilizes the remarkable properties of the rare radioac-
tive metal vitalium which is believed to be the very
basis of life since it was first discovered to exist in
minute traces in those complex substances so necessary
to all life the vitamins large deposits were discovered
at kepler and elsewhere on the moon during the twenty-
first century under the suns rays vitalium under-
goes a change to triatomic form storing up the vast en-
ergy of sunlight the vitalium plates from the sun-
shine are built into batteries with alternate sheets of cop-
per from which the solar energy may be drawn in the
form of electric current as the battery discharges the
vitalium reverts to its stabler allotropic form and may
be used again and again the vitalium power com-
panys plants in arizona chili australia the sahara
and the gobi now furnish most of the earths power
the sunship recharging its vitalium batteries in space
can cruise indefinitely

it was on the fifth day out from lakehurst the
fury with her sister ships spread out some thou-
sands of miles to right and left was cruising at five
thousand miles per hour at heliocentric elevation -

 ecliptic declination    north right
ascension xix hours  min  sec the earth was a
little green globe beside her and the moon a thin silver
crescent beyond

  object ahead called a lookout in the domed pilot-
house of the fury turning from his telescope to where
captain brand and bill stood smoking comfortably held
to the floor by the ships acceleration in scorpio about
five degrees above antares distance fifteen thousand
miles it seems to be round and blue

  the prince at last brand chuckled an eager grin
on his square chinned face light of battle flashing in his
blue eyes

  he gave orders that set the heliographic mirrors flick-
ering signals for all nine of the moon patrol fliers to
converge about the strange object in a great crescent
the black fins that carried the charging vitalium plates
were drawn in and the full power of the motor ray tubes
thrown on to drive ahead each slender silver flier at
the limit of her acceleration

  four telescopes from the fury were turned upon the
strange object captain brand and bill took turns peer-
ing through one of them when bill looked he saw
the infinite black gulf of space silvered with star-dust
of distant nebulae hanging in the blackness was an
azure sphere gleaming bright as a great globe cut from
turquoise bill was reminded of a similar blue globe
he had seen-when he had stood at the enormous tele-
scope on trainors tower and watched a little blue
circle against the red deserts of mars

brand took two or three observations figured swiftly
its moving he said about fourteen thousand
miles per hour funny it is moving directly toward
the earth almost from the direction of the planet mars

i wonder- he seized the pencil figured again

queer that thing seems headed for the earth from
a point on the orbit of mars where that planet was
about forty days ago do you suppose the martians
are paying us a visit 

  then its not the prince of space

  i dont know its direction might be just a coinci-
dence and the prince might be a martian for all i
know anyhow were going to find what that blue
globe is

  two hours later the nine sunships were drawn up in
the form of a great half circle closing swiftly on the
blue globe which had been calculated to be about one
hundred feet in diameter the sunships were nearly
a thousand miles from the globe and scattered along a
curved line two thousand miles in length captain brand
gave orders for eight forward tubes on each flier to be
made ready for use as weapons from his own ship he
flashed a heliographic signal

  the fury of the moon patrol demands that you
show ships papers identification tags for all passengers
and submit to search for contraband

  the message was three times repeated but no reply
came from the azure globe it continued on its course
the slender white sunships came plunging swiftly to-
ward it until the crescent they formed was not two
hundred miles between the points the blue globe not a
hundred miles from the war-fliers

  then bill with his eye at a telescope saw a little spark
of purple light appear beside the blue globe a tiny
bright point of violet-red fire with a white line running
from it back to the center of the sphere the purple
spark grew the white line lengthened abruptly the


amazing stories

newspaperman realized that the purple was an object
hurtling toward him with incredible speed

even as the realization burst upon him the spark
became visible as a little red-blue sphere brightly
luminous a white beam shone behind it seemed to
push it with ever-increasing velocity the purple globe
shot past vanished the white ray snapped out

  a weapon he exclaimed

  a weapon and a warning said brand still peering
through another eyepiece and we reply

  heliograph he shouted into a speaking tube each
ship will open with one forward tube operating one
second twelve times per minute increase power of
rear tubes to compensate repulsion

  white shields flickered blindingly brilliant rays
straight bars of dazzling opalescence burst intermittently
from each of the nine ships striking across a hundred
miles of space to batter the blue globe with a hail of
charged atoms

  again a purple spark appeared from the sapphire
globe with a beam of white fire behind it a tiny purple
globe hurtling at an inconceivable velocity before a
lance of white flame it reached out with a certain de-
liberation yet too quickly for a man to do more than
see it

  it struck a sunship at one tip of the crescent forma-
tion

  a dazzing flash of violet flame burst out the tiny
globe seemed to explode into a huge flare of red-blue
light and where the slim eight-sided ship had been
was a crushed and twisted mass of metal

  a solid projectile brand cried and driven on
the positive ray our experts have tried it but the
ray always exploded the shell and that was some ex-
plosion i dont know what-unless atomic energy

  the eight sunships that remained were closing swiftly
upon the blue globe the dazzling white rays flashed in-
termittently from them they struck the blue globe
squarely-the fighting crews of the moon patrol are
trained until their rays are directed with deadly accuracy
the azure sphere unharmed shone with bright radiance
-it seemed that a thin mist of glittering blue particles
was gathering about it like a dust of powdered sap-
phires

  another purple spark leapt from the turquoise globe

  in the time that it took a mans eyes to move from
globe to slim glistening sunship the white ray had
driven the purple spark across the distance another
vivid flash of violet light and another sunship became
a hurtling mass of twisted wreckage

  we are seven brand quoted grimly

  heliograph he shouted into the mouthpiece fire
all forward tubes one second twenty times a minute
increase rear power to maximum

  white rays burst from the seven darting sunships
flashing off and on that sapphire globe grew bright
with a strange luminosity the thin mist of sparkling
blue particles seemed to grow more dense about it

  our rays dont seem to be doing any good brand
muttered puzzled the blue about that globe must be
some sort of vibratory screen

  another purple spark with the narrow white line of
fire behind it swept across to the flier from the opposite
horn of the crescent burst into a sheet of blinding red-
violet light another ship was a twisted mass of metal

  seven no longer brand called grimly to bill

  looks as if the prince has got us beaten the re-
porter cried

  not while a ship can fight exclaimed the captain
this is the moon patrol

  another tiny purple globe traced its line of light
across the black star-misted sky another sunship
crumpled in a violet flash

  theyre picking em off the ends bill observed
were in the middle so i guess were last

  then said captain brand weve got time to ram
em

  control he shouted into the speaking tube cut
off forward tubes and make all speed for the enemy
heliograph fight to the end i am going to ram
them

  another red-blue spark moved with its quick deliber-
ation a purple flash left another ship in twisted ruin

  bill took his eye from the telescope the blue globe
bright under the rays with the sapphire mist sparkling
about it was only twenty miles away he could see it
with his naked eye drifting swifdy among the familiar
stars of scorpio

  it grew larger very swiftly

  with the quickness of thought the purple sparks
moved out alternately to right and to left they never
missed each one exploded in purple flame crushed
a sunship

  three fliers left bill counted eyes on the growing
blue globe before them two left good-by brand
he grasped the bluff captains hand one left will
we have time 

  he looked forward the blue globe with the dancing
sparkling haze of sapphire swirling about it was swiftly
expanding

  the last one our turn now

  he saw a tiny fleck of purle light dart out of the ex-
panding azure sphere that they had hoped to ram then
red-violet flame seemed to envelope him he felt the
floor of the bridge tremble beneath his feet he heard
the beginning of a shivering crash like that of shattering
glass then the world was mercifully dark and still

chapter iii

the city of space

bill lay on an alpine glacier a painful broken
leg inextricably wedged in a crevasse it was
dark frightfully cold in vain he struggled to
move to seek light and warmth while the grim grip of
the ice held him while bitter wind howled about him and
the piercing cold of the blizzard crept numbingly up his
limbs

  he came to with a start realized that it was a dream
but he was none the less freezing gasping for thin
frigid air that somehow would not come into his lungs
all about was darkness he lay on cold metal

  in the wreck of the fury he thought the air is
leaking out and the cold of space a frozen tomb

  he must have made a sound for a groan came from
beside him he fought to draw breath tried to speak
he choked and his voicc was oddly high and thin

 who are-

  he ended in a fit of coughing felt warm blood spray-
ing from his mouth faintly he heard a whisper beside
him

  im brand the moon patrol-fought to the last
the prince of space



  bill could speak no more and evidently the redoubt-
able coptain could not for a long time they lay in freez-
ing silence bill had no hope of life he felt only very
grim satisfaction in the fact that he and brand had not
been killed outright

  but suddenly he was thrilled with hope he heard a
crash of hammer blows upon metal sharp as the sound
of snapping glass in the thin air then he heard the
thin hiss of an oxygen lance

  someone was cutting a way to them through the
wreckage only a moment later it seemed a vivid bar
of light cleft the darkness searched the wrecked bridge
settled upon the two limp figures bill saw grotesque
figures in clumbrous metal space suits clambering
through a hole they had cut he felt an oxygen helmet
being fastened about his head heard the thin hiss of
the escaping gas and was once more able to breathe
again he slipped into oblivion

  he awoke with the sensation that infinite time had
passed he sat up quickly feeling strong alert fully
recovered in every faculty a clear memory of every de-
tail of the disastrous encounter with the strange blue
globe-ship springing instantly to his mind

  he was in a clean bed in a little white-walled room
captain brand a surprised grin on his bluff rough-hewn
features was sitting upon another bed beside him two
attendants in white uniform stood just inside the door
and a nervous little man in black suit evidently a doctor
was hastily replacing gleaming instruments in a leather
bag

  a tall man appeared suddenly in the door clad in a
striking uniform of black scarlet and gold-black
trousers scarlet military coat and cap gold buttons and
decorations he carried in his hand a glittering positive
ray pistol

  gentlemen he said in a crisp gruff voice you may
consider yourselves prisoners of the prince of space
how come brand demanded

  the prince was kind enough to have you removed
from the wreck of your ship and brought aboard the
red rover his own sunship you have been kept un-
conscious until your recovery was complete

  and what do you want with us now brand was
rather aggressive

  the man with the pistol smiled that gentlemen i
am happy to say rests largely with yourselves

  i am an officer in the moon patrol said brand i

prefer death to anything-

  wait captain you need have none but the kindest
feelings for my master the prince of space i now ask
you nothing but your word as an officer and a gentleman
that you will act as becomes a guest of the prince your
promise will lose you nothing and win you much
very good i promise brand agreed after a mo-
ment -for twenty-four hours

  he pulled out his watch looked at it the man in
the door lowered his pistol smiling and walked across
to shake hands with brand

  call me smith he introduced himself captain of
the princes cruiser red rover

  still smiling he beckoned toward the door

  and if you like gentlemen you may come with me
to the bridge the red rover is to land in an hour
brand sprang nimbly to the floor and bill followed
the flier was maintaining a moderate acceleration-they
felt light but were able to walk without difficulty be-
yond the door was a round shaft with a ladder through

its length captain smith clambered up the ladder
brand and bill swung up behind him

   after an easy climb of fifty feet or so they entered a
domed pilot-house with vitrolite observation panels
telescopes maps and charts and speaking tube-an ar-
rangement similiar to that of the fury

  black star-strewn heavens lay before them bill
looked for the earth found it visible in the periscopic
screens almost behind them it was a little green disk
the moon but a white dot beside it

  we land in an hour he exclaimed

  i didnt say where said captain smith smiling
our landing place is a million miles from the earth

  not on earth  then where-

  at the city of space

  the city of space

  the capital of the prince of space it is not a thou-
sand miles before us

  bill peered ahead through the vitrolite dome dis-
tinguished the bright constellation of sagittarius with
the luminous clouds of the galaxy behind it

  i dont see anything-

  the prince does not care to advertise his city the
outside of the city of space is covered with black vi-
talium-which furnishes us with power reflecting
none of the suns rays it cannot be seen by reflected
light against the black background of space it is in-
visible except when it occults a star

captain smith busied himself with giving
orders for the landing bill and brand stood for
many minutes looking forward through the vitrolite
dome while the motor ray tubes retarded the flier pres-
ently a little black point came against the silver haze of
the milky way it grew stars vanishing behind its rim
until a huge section of the heavens was utterly black be-
fore them

  the city of space is in a cylinder captain smith
said roughly five thousand feet in diameter and
about that high it is built largely of meteoric iron
which we captured from a meteorite swarm-making
navigation safe and getting useful metal at the same
time the cylinder whirls constantly with such speed
that the centrifugal force against the sides equals the
force of gravity on the earth the city is built around
the inside of the cylinder-so that one can look up and
see his neighbors house apparently upside down a mile
above his head we enter through a lock in one end of
the cylinder

  a vast disk of dull black metal was now visible a few
yards outside the vitrolite panels a huge metal valve
swung open in it revealing a bright space beyond the
red rover moved into the chamber the mighty valve
closed behind her air hissed in about her an inner
valve was opened and she slipped into the city of
space

  they were bill saw at the center of an enormous
cylinder the sides half a mile away above and below
them were covered with buildings along neat tree-
bordered streets scattered with green lawns tiny gar-
dens and bits of wooded park it seemed very strange
to bill to see these endless streets about the inside of a
tube so that one by walking a little over three miles
in one direction would arrive again at the starting point
in the same way that one gets back to the starting point
after going around the earth in one direction

   at the ends of the cylinder fastened to the huge metal


amazing stories

disks which closed the ends were elaborate and complex
mechanisms machines strange and massive they
must be for heating the city bill thought and for
purifying the air for furnishing light and power per-
haps even for moving it about the lock through which
they had entered was part of this mechanism

   in the center of each end of the cylinder hung a huge
light seeming large and round as the sun flooding the
place with brilliant mellow rays

   there are five thousand people here said captain
smith the prince has always kept the best specimens
among his captives and others have been recruited be-
sides we are self-sustaining as the earth is we use
the power of the sun-through our vitalium batteries
we grow our own food we utilize our waste products-
matter here goes through a regular cycle of life and
death as on the earth men eat food containing carbon
breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide our
plants break up the carbon dioxide make more foods
containing the same carbon and give off the oxygen for
men to breathe again our nitrogen or oxygen and
hydrogen go through similar cycles the power of
the sun is all we need from outside

  captain smith guided his guests down the ladder
and out through the ships airlock they entered an ele-
vator three minutes later they stepped off upon the
side of the great cylinder that housed the city and en-
tered a low building with a broad concrete road curving
up before it as they stepped out it gave bill a curious
dizzy feeling to look up and see busy streets inverted
a mile above his head the road before them curved
smoothly up on either hand bordered with beautiful
trees until its ends met again above his head

   the centrifugal force that held objects against the
sides of the cylinder acted in precisely the same way as
gravity on the earth-except that it pulled away from
the center of the cylinder instead of toward it

  a glistening heliocar came skimming down upon
whirling heliocopters dropped to rubber tires and rolled
up beside them a young man of military bearing clad
in a striking uniform of red black and gold stepped
out saluted stiffly

   captain smith he said the prince desires your at-
tendance at his private office immediately with your
guests

   smith motioned bill and captain brand into the richly
upholstered body of the heliocar bill gazing up at the
end of the huge cylinder with a city inside it caught
sight for the first time of the exterior of the red rover
the ship that had brought them to the city of space it
lay just beside the massive machinery of the air-lock
supported in a heavy metal cradle with the elevator tube
running straight from it to the building behind them

  look brand bill gasped that isnt the blue
globe it isnt the ship we fought at all

  brand looked the red rover was much the same
sort of ship that the fury had been she was slender
and tapering cigar-shaped some two hundred feet in
length and twenty-five in diameter-nearly twice as
large as the fury she was cylindrical instead of octa-
gonal and she mounted twenty-four motor tubes in two
rings fore and aft of twelve each instead of eight

  brand turned to smith hows this he demanded
where is the blue globe did you have two ships

   a smile flickered over smiths stern face you have
a revelation waiting for you but it is better not to keep
the prince waiting

   they stepped into the heliocar the pilot sprang to
his place set the electric motors whirring the ma-
chine rolled easily forward took the air on spinning heli-
copters the road lined with green gardens and bright
cottages dropped away below them and other houses
drew nearer above in the center of the cylinder the
young man dextrously inverted the flier and they con-
tinued on a straight line toward an imposing concrete
building which now seemed below

the heliocar landed they sprang out and ap-
proached the imposing building of several stories
guards uniformed in scarlet black and gold standing
just outside the door held ray pistols in readiness smith
hurried his guests past they entered a long high-
ceilinged room it gave a first impression of stately
luxury the walls were paneled with rich dark wood
hung with a few striking paintings it was almost empty
of furniture a heavy desk stood alone toward the
farther end a tall young man rose from behind this
desk advanced rapidly to meet them

   my guests sir said smith captain brand of the
fury and a reporter

  the mysterious mr cain bill gasped

   indeed mr cain stood before him a tall man slender
and wiry with a certain not unhandsome sternness in
his dark face a smile twinkled in his black enigmatic
eyes-which none the less looked as if they might easily
flash with fierce authority

  and mr win-or i believe you asked me to call

you bill you seem a very hard man to evade

   still smiling enigmatically mr cain took bills hand
and then shook hands with captain brand

  but-are you the prince of space bill demanded
i am cain was only a nom de guerre so to speak
gentlemen i welcome you to the city of space

  and you kidnaped yourself

  my men brought the red rover for me

   dr trainor and his daughter- bill ejaculated

  they are friends of mine they are here

  and that blue globe said captain brand what
was that

  you saw the course it was following

   it was headed to intersect the orbit of the earth-
and its direction was on a line that cuts the orbit of mars
where that planet was forty days ago

   the prince turned to bill and you have seen some-
thing like that blue globe before

  why yes the little blue circle on mars-that i
saw through the great telescope on trainors tower

   a sober smile flickered across the dark lean face of
the prince

  then gentlemen you should believe me the earth
is threatened with a dreadful danger from mars the
blue globe that wrecked your fleet was a ship from mars
it was another martian flier that took the helicon i
believe i have credit for that ghastly exploit of sucking
out the passengers blood his smile became grimly
humorous one of the consequences of my position
martian fliers echoed captain brand then how
did we come to be on your ship

  i havent any weapon that will meet those purple
atomic bombs on equal terms-though we are now work-
ing out a new device i had smith cruising around the
blue globe in our red rover to see what he could learn
he was investigating the wrecks and found yau alive
you really mean that men from mars have come this
the prince of space



near the earth captain brand was frankly incredulous

  not men the prince corrected smiling but things
from mars have done it they have already landed on
earth in fact

  he turned to the desk picked up a broad sheet of
cardboard

  i have a color photograph here

  bill studied it saw that it looked like an aerial pho-
tograph of a vast stretch of mountain and desert a mon-
otonous expanse of gray tinged with green and red

  a photograph taken from space of part of the state
of chihuahua mexico and see

  he pointed to a little blue disk in the green-gray ex-
panse of a plain just below a narrow mountain ridge
with the fine green line that marked a river just beside it

  that blue circle is the first ship that came it was
the things aboard it that sucked the blood out of the
people on the helicon

  captain brand was staring at the tall smiling man
with a curious expression on his red square-chinned
face suddenly he spoke

  your highness or whatever we must call you-

  just call me prince cain is not my name once i
had a name-but now i am nameless

  the thin dark face suddenly lined with pain the lips
closed in a narrow line the prince swept a hand across
his high forehead as if to sweep something unpleasant
away

  well prince im with you that is if you want
an officer from the moon patrol a sheepish smile
overspread his bluff features i would have killed a
man for suggesting that i would ever do such a thing
but ill fight for you as well as i ever did for the honor
of the patrol

  thanks brand the prince took his hand smil-
ing again

  count me in too of course said bill

  both of you will be valuable men said the prince
he picked up a sheaf of papers scanned them quickly
seemed to mark off one item from a sheet and add
another

  the red rover sets out for the earth in one hour
gentlemen were going to try a surprise attack on that
blue globe in the desert you will both go aboard
and im going too a womans voice soft and a
little husky spoke beside them recognizing it bill
turned to see paula trainor standing behind them an
eager smile on her elfinly beautiful face her amazing
eyes were fixed upon the prince their brown depths
filled for the moment with passionate wistful yearn-
ing

  why no paula the prince said its dangerous
tears swam mistily in the golden orbs i will go
i must i must the girl cried out the words a sobbing
catch in her voice

  very well then the prince agreed smiling absently
you father will be along of course but anything will
be likely to happen

  but you will be there in danger too cried the girl
we start in an hour said the prince smith you
may take brand and windsor back aboard the red
rover

  curse his fatherly indifference bill muttered under
his breath as they walked out through the guarded door
cant he see that she loves him 

smith must have heard him for he turned to him
spoke confidentially the prince is a determined mis-

ogynist i think an unfortunate love affair was what
ruined his life-back on the earth he left his history
even his name behind him i think a woman was the
trouble he wont look at a woman now

  they were outside again startled anew by the amaz-
ing scene of a street of houses and gardens that curved
evenly up on either side of them and met above so that
men were moving about head downward directly above
them

  the heliocar was waiting the three got aboard were
lifted and swiftly carried to the slender silver cylinder
of the red rover where it hung among the ponderous
machinery of the air-lock on the end of the huge cy-
linder that housed the amazing city of space

  i will show you your rooms said captain smith
and in an hour we are off to attack the martians in
mexico

chapter iv

vampires in the desert

forty hours later the red rover entered the at-
mosphere of the earth above northern mexico
it was night the desert was shrouded in blackness
the telescopes revealed only the lights at ranches scat-
tered as thinly as they had been two centuries before

bill was in the bridge-room with captain smith

  the blue globe that destroyed your fleet has already
landed here smith said we saw both of them before
they slipped into the shadow of night they were right 
together and it seems that a white metal building has
been set up between them

  the prince means to attack in spite of those purple
atomic bombs bill seemed surprised

  yes they are below a low mountain ridge we
land on the other side of the hill a dozen miles off and
give em a surprise at dawn

  wed better be careful bill said doubtfully
theyre more likely to surprise us if you had been in
front of one of those little purple bombs flying on the
white ray

  we have a sort of rocket torpedo that doc trainor
invented the prince means to try that on em

  the red rover dropped swiftly with smiths skilled
hands on the controls it seemed but a few minutes until
the dark shadow of the earth beneath abruptly resolved
itself into a level plain scattered with looming shapes that
were clumps of mesquite and sagebrush the slim
silver cylinder came silently to rest upon the desert be-
neath stars that shone clearly though to bill they seemed
dim in comparison with the splendid wonders of space

  three hours before dawn five men slipped out
through the air-lock the prince himself was the leader
with captains brand and smith bill and a young officer
named walker each man carried a searchlight and a
positive ray pistol and strapped upon the back of each
was a rocket torpedo-a smooth white metal tube four
feet long and as many inches thick weighing some eighty
pounds

  dr trainor kindly bald-headed old scientist was
left in charge of the ship he and his daughter came
out of the air-lock into the darkness to bid the five
adventurers farewell

  we should be back by night said the prince his
even white teeth flashing in the darkness wait for us
until then if we dont come return at once to the city


amazing stories

of space i want no one to follow us and no attempt
made to rescue us if we dont come back if we arent
back by tomorrow night we shall be dead

  very good sir trainor nodded

  im coming with you then paula declared suddenly

  absolutely you are not cried the prince dr
trainor i command you not to let your daughter off
the ship until we return

  paula turned quickly away a slim pillar of misty
white in the darkness bill heard a little choking sound
he knew that she had burst into tears

  i cant let you go off into such danger without me
she cried almost hysterical i cant

  the prince swung a heavy torpedo higher on his
shoulders and strode off over-bare gravel toward the
low rocky slope of the mountain that lay to northward
faintly revealed in the light of the stars the other four
followed silently the slender sunship with the old
scientist and his sobbing daughter outside the air-lock
quickly vanished behind them

  with only an occasional cautious flicker of the flash-
lights the five men picked their way over bare hard
ground among scattered clumps of mesquite presently
they crossed a barren lava bed clambering over huge
blocks of twisted black volcanic rock up the slope of
the mountain they struggled sweating under heavy
burdens blundering into spiky cactus stumbling over
boulders and sagebrush

  when the silver and rose of dawn came in the purple
eastern sky the five lay on bare rock at the top of the
low ridge overlooking the flat mesquite-covered valley
beyond the valley floor was a brownish green in the
light of morning the hills that rose far across it a hazy
blue-gray faintly tinged with green on age-worn slopes

  like a string of emeralds dropped down the valley
lay an endless wandering line of cottonwoods of a light
and vivid green that stood out from the somber plain
these trees traced the winding course of a stream the
rio casas grandes

  lying against the cottonwoods and rising above their
tops were two great spheres of blue gleaming like twin
globes of lapis lazuli in the morning light they were
not far apart and between them rose a curious domed
structure of white silvery metal

  each of the five men lifted his heavy metal tube
leveled it across a boulder before him the prince
alert and smiling despite the dust and stain of the march
through the desert spoke to the others

  this little tube along the top of the torpedo is a
telescope sight you will peer through get the cross
hairs squarely upon your target and hold them there
then press this nickeled lever that starts the projectile
inside the case to spinning so that inertia will hold it
true then being certain that the aim is correct press
the red button the torpedo is thrown from the case by
compressed air and a positive ray mechanism drives it
true to the target when it strikes about fifty pounds of
dr trainors new explosive trainite will be set off

  walker you and windsor take the right globe
smith and brand the left ill have a shot at that pecu-
liar edifice between them

  bill balanced his torpedo peered through the tele-
scope and pressed the lever the hum of a motor came
from the heavy tube

  all ready the prince inquired

  ready each man returned

  fire

  bill pressed the red button the tube drove heavily
backward in his hands and then was but a light sheet-
metal shell he saw a little gleam of white light before
him against the right blue globe a diminishing point it
was the motor ray that drove the torpedo speeding to-
ward its mark

great flares of orange light hid the two azure
spheres and the white dome between them the
spheres and the dome crumpled and vanished and a
thin haze of bluish smoke swirled about them

  good shooting the prince commented this motor
torpedo of trainors ought to put a lot of the old fight-
ing equipment in the museum-if we were disposed to
bestow such a dangerous toy upon humanity

  but lets get over and see what happened

  grasping ray pistols they sprang to their feet and
plunged down the rocky slope it was five miles to
the river nearly two hours later it was when the five
men slipped out of the mesquites to look two hundred
yards across an open grassy flat to the wall of green
trees along the river

  three great heaps of wreckage lay upon the flat at
the right and the left were crumpled masses of bright
silver metal-evidently the remains of the globes in
the center was another pile of bent and twisted metal
which had been the domed building

  funny that those blue globes look like ordinary
white metal now said smith

  i wonder if the blue is not some sort of etheric
screen brand commented when we were fighting
our rays seemed to take no effect it occurred to me
that some vibratory wall might have stopped them

  its possible the prince agreed ill take up the
possibilities with trainor if they have such a screen
it might even be opaque to gravity quite a convenience
in maneuvering a ship

  as they spoke they were advancing cautiously stop-
ping to pick up bits of white metal that had been scat-
tered about by the explosion

  suddenly bills eyes caught movement from the pile
of crumpled metal that had been the white dome it
seemed that a green plant was growing quickly from
among the ruins green tendrils shot up amazingly
then he saw on the end of a twisted stalk a glowing
purple thing that looked somehow like an eye

  at first sight of the thing he had stopped in amaze-
ment leveling his deadly ray pistol and shouting look
out

  before the shout had died in his throat before the
others had time to turn their heads they caught the
flash of metal among the twining green tentacles the
thing was lifting a metal object

  then bill saw a tiny purple spark dart from a bright
little mechanism that the green tendrils held he saw a
blinding flash of violet light his consciousness was cut
off abruptly

  the next he knew he was lying on his back on rocky
soil he felt considerably bruised and battered and his
right eye was swollen so that he could not open it
struggling to a sitting position he found his hands and
feet bound by bloody manacles of unfamiliar design
captain brand was lying on his elbow beside him half
under the thin shade of a mesquite bush brand looked
much torn and disheveled blood was streaming across
his face from a gash in his scalp his hands and feet also
were bound with fetters of white metal
the prince of space



  what happened bill called dazedly

not so loud brand whispered the thing-a mar-
tian left alive i guess it is must have been somewhere
out in the brush when we shot it blew us up with an
atomic bomb smith and walker dead-blown to pieces
and the prince

  i can speak for myself

  hearing the familiar low voice bill turned he saw
the prince squatted down in the blazing sunshine hands
and feet manacled hat off and face covered with blood
and grime

  was it that-that green thing bill asked

  looks like a sort of animated plant said the prince
a bunch of green tentacles that it uses for hands
three purple eyes on green stalks just enough of a
body to join it all together not like anything i ever
saw but the martians originating under different con-
ditions ought to be different

  what is going to happen now  bill inquired
probably it will suck our blood-as it did to the
passengers of the helicon brand suggested grimly

  windsor fell silent it was almost noon the desert
sun was very hot the motionless air was oppressive
with a dry parching heat and flies buzzed annoyingly
about his bleeding cuts wrists and ankles ached under
the cruel pressure of the manacles

  wish the thing would come back and end the sus-
pense brand muttered

  bill reflected with satisfaction that he had no relatives
to be saddened by his demise he had no great fear of
death newspaper work in the twenty-second century
is not all commonplace monotony your veteran re-
porter is pretty well inured to danger

  glad i havent anyone to worry about me he ob-
served

  so am i the prince said bitterly i left them all

years ago

  but you have someone bill cried it isnt my
business to say it but that makes no difference now
and youre a fool not to know paula trainor loves
you this will kill her

  the prince looked up a bitter smile visible behind
the bloody grime on his thin dark face

  paula-in love with me were friends of course
but love i used to believe in love i have not been al-
ways a nameless outcast of space once i had name
family-even wealth and position i trusted my name
and my honor to a beautiful woman i loved her she
said she loved me-i thought she meant it she used me
for a tool i was trustful she was clever

  the dark eyes of the prince burned in fierce anger
when she was through with me she left me to die
in disgrace i barely escaped with my life she had
robbed me of my name wealth position she named me
the outlaw she made me appear a traitor to those who
trusted me-then laughed at me she laughed at me and
called me a fool i was-but i wont be again

  at first i was filled with anger at the whole world
at the unjust laws and the silly conventions and the
cruel intolerance of men i became the pirate of space
a pariah fighting against my own kind struggling
desperately for power

  for a few moments he was moodily silent slapping
at the flies that buzzed around his bloody wounds

  i gained power and i learned of the dangers from
mars first i was glad glad to see the race of man
swept out parasites men seemed insects life-what

is it but a kind of decay on a mote in space then i
got a saner view and built the city of space to save
a few men then because the few seemed to have noble
qualities i resolved to try to save the world

  but it is too late we have lost and i have had
enough of love enough of women with their soft allur-
ing bodies and the sweet lying voices and the heartless
scheming

the prince fell into black silence motionless heed-
less of the flies that swarmed about him presently
brand contrived despite his manacles to fish a packet of
cigarettes from his pocket extract one and tossed the
others to bill who managed to light one for the prince
the three battered men sat in dazzling sun and blistering
heat smoking and trying to forget heat and flies and
torturing manacles-and the death that loomed so near

  it was early noon when bill heard a little rustling
beyond the mesquites in a moment the martian ap-
peared a grotesque and terrifying being it was scores
of green tentacles slender and writhing grew from an
insignificant body three lidless purple eyes staring
alien and malevolent watched them alertly from foot-
long green stalks that rose above the body the creature
half walked on tentacles extended below it half dragged
itself along by green appendages that reached out to
grasp mesquite limbs above it one inch-thick coil
carried a curious instrument of glittering crystal and
white metal-it was a strange gleaming thing remotely
like a ray pistol and fastened about another tentacle
was a little metal ring from which an odd-looking little
bar dangled

  the thing came straight for the prince bill screamed
a warning the prince saw it twisted himself over
on the ground tried desperately to crawl away the
thing reached out a slender tentacle many yards long
it grasped him about the neck drew him back

  in a moment the dreadful being was crouching in
a writhing green mass above the body of the manacled
man once he screamed piteously then there was no
sound save loud gasping breaths his muscles knotted
as he struggled in agony against the fetters and the coils
of the monster

  bill and captain brand lay there unable either to
escape or to give assistance in silent horror they watched
the scene they saw that each slender green tentacle
ended in a sharp-edged suction disk they watched the
disks forcing themselves against the throat of the agon-
ized man tearing a way through his clothing to his body
they saw constrictions move down the rubber-like green
tentacles as if they were sucking while red drops oozed
out about the edge of the disks

  our turn next muttered captain brand

  and after us the world bill breathed tense with
horror

  a narrow white beam blindingly brilliant flashed
from beyond the dull green foliage of the mesquite it
struck the crouching monster waveringly without
a sound it leapt flinging itself aside from the body of
the prince it raised its curious weapon a tiny purple
spark darted from it

  a shattering crash rang out at a little distance there
was a thin scream-a womans scream

  then the white ray stabbed at the monster again and
it collapsed in a twitching heap of thin green coils upon
the still body of the prince

  a slender girl rushed out of the brush tossed aside


amazing stories

a ray pistol and flung herself upon the monster trying
to drag it from the prince it was paula trainor her
clothing was torn her skin was scratched and bleeding
from miles of running through the desert of rocks and
cactus and thorny mesquite she was evidently ex-
hausted but she flung herself with desperate energy
to the rescue of the injured man

  the body of the dead thing was light enough but
the sucking disks still clung to the flesh they pulled and
tore it when she tugged at them she struggled des-
perately to drag them loose by turns sobbing and laugh-
ing hysterically

  if you can help us get loose we might help bill
suggested

  the girl raised a piteous face oh mr bill-cap-
tain brand is he dead 

  i think not miss paula the thing had just jumped
on him buck up

  see the little bar-it looks like a sliver of aluminum
-fastened to the metal ring about that coil brand
said it might be the key for these chains end of it
seems to be shaped about right suppose you try it

  in nervous haste the girl tore the little bar from its
ring with brands aid she was able to unlock his
fetters the captain lost no time in freeing bill and
removing the manacles from the unconscious prince

  the thin rubber-like tentacles could not be torn loose
brand cut them with his knife he found them tough
and fibrous red blood flowed from them when they
were severed

  bill carried the injured man down to the shade of the
cottonwoods brought water to him in a hat from the
muddy little stream below in a few minutes he was
conscious though weak from loss of blood

  captain brand after satisfying himself that paula
had killed the martian and that it was the only one
that had survived in the wreckage of the blue globes and
the metal dome set off to cross the mountain and bring
back the sunship

  when the red rover came into view late that eve-
ning a beautiful slender bar of silver against the pyro-
technic gold and scarlet splendor of the desert sunset
the prince of space was hobbling about supported on
bills arm examining the wreckage of the martian
fliers

  paula was hovering eagerly about him anxious to
aid him bill noticed the pain and despair that clouded
her brown eyes she had been holding the princes head
in her arms when he regained consciousness her lips
had been very close to his and bright tears were brim-
ming in her golden eyes

  bill had seen the prince push her away then thank
her gruffly when he had found what she had done

  paula you have done a great thing for the world
bill had heard him say

  it wasnt the world at all it was for you the girl
had cried tearfully

  she had turned away to hide her tears and the
prince had said nothing more

  the red rover landed beside the wreckage of the
martian fliers after a few hours spent in examining
and photographing the wrecks in taking specimens of
the white alloy of which they were built and of other
substances used in the construction they all went back
on the sunship taking the dead martian and other ob-
jects for further study brand took off for the upper
atmosphere

  captain brand the prince said as they stood in
the bridge room since the death of poor captain smith
this morning i believe you are the most skillful sunship
officer in my organization hereafter you are in com-
mand of the red rover with harris and vincent as
your officers

  we have a huge task before us the victory we have
won is but the first hand in the game that decides
the fate of earth

chapter v
the tritons treasure

t must have at least two tons of vitalium the

i prince of space told bill when the newspaper-
man came to the bridge of the red rover after
twenty hours in the bunk the prince was pale and
weak from loss of blood but seemed to suffer no other
ill effects from his encounter with the martian

  two tons of vitalium bill exclaimed a small
demand i doubt if there is that much on the market
if you had all the confederations treasury to buy it
with

  i must have it and at once i am going to fit out
the red rover for a voyage to mars it will take that
much vitalium for the batteries

  we are going to mars

  the only hope for humanity is for us to strike first
and to strike hard

if the world knew of the danger we could get help

  thats where you come in i told you that i should
need publicity it is your business to tell the public
about things i want you to tell humanity about the
danger from mars make it convincing and make it
strong say anything you like so long as you leave the
prince of space out of it i have the body of the martian
that attacked me preserved in alcohol you have that
and the wreckage in the desert to substantiate your
story i will land you at trainors tower in new york
tonight you will have twenty-four hours to convince
the world and raise two tons of vitalium it has to be
done

  a big order bill said doubtfully but ill do my
best

  the city was a bright carpet of twinkling lights when
the red rover darted down out of a black sky hovering
for a moment over trainors tower when it flashed
away bill was standing alone on top of the loftiest
building on earth in his pocket a sheaf of manuscript on
which he had been at work for many hours beside him
a bulky package that contained the preserved body of
the weird monster from mars

  he opened the trapdoor-which was conveniently un-
locked-took up the package and clambered down a
ladder into the observatory an intent man was busy at
the great telescope-which pointed toward the red planet
mars the man looked understanding at bill and
nodded toward the elevator

in half an hour bill was exhibiting his package and
his manuscript to the night editor of the herald-sun

  the greatest news in the century he cried the
earth attacked by mars it was a martian ship that
took the helicon i have one of the dead creatures
from mars in this box

the astounded editor formed a quick opinion that
his star reporter had met with some terrifying expe-
the prince of space



rience that had unsettled his brain he listened skepti-
cally while bill related a true enough account of the
cruise of the moon patrol ships and of the battle with
the blue globe bill omitted any mention of the city of
space and its enigmatic ruler but let it be assumed
that the fury had rammed the globe and that it had
fallen in the desert he ended with a wholly fictitious
account of how a mysterious scientist had picked him
up in a sunship had told him of the invaders from mars
and had sent him to collect two tons of vitalium to
equip his ship for a raid on mars bill had spent many
hours in planning his story he was sure that it sounded
as plausible as the amazing reality of the prince of space
and his wonderful city

  the skeptical editor was finally convinced as much
by his faith in bills probity as by the body of the green
monster the scraps of a strange white metal and the
photographs which he presented as material evidence
the editor radioed to have a plane sent from el paso
texas to investigate the wrecks when it was reported
that they were just as billhad said the herald-sun
issued an extra which carried bills full account with
photographs of the dead monster and scientific accounts
of the other evidence there was an appeal for two tons
of vitalium to enable the unknown scientist to save the
world by making a raid on mars

  the story created an enormous sensation all over the
world a good many people believed it the herald-
sun actually received half a million eagles in subscrip-
tions to buy the vitalium-a sum sufficient to purchase
about eleven ounces of that precious metal

  most of the world laughed it was charged that bill
was insane it was charged that the herald-sun was at-
tempting to expand its circulation by a baseless canard
worse it was charged that bill perhaps in complicity
with the management of the great newspaper was mak-
ing the discovery of a new sort of creature in some far
corner of the world the basis for a gigantic fraud to
secure that vast amount of vitalium

  examination proved that the wrecks in the desert had
been demolished by explosion instead of by falling a
court injunction was filed against the herald-sun to pre-
vent collection of the subscriptions and bill might have
been arrested if he had not wisely retired to trainors
tower

  finally it was charged that the pirate the prince of
space was at the bottom of it-possibly the charge was
suggested by the fact that the chief object of the princes
raids had always been vitalium a rival paper asserted
that the pirate must have captured bill and sent him
back to earth with this fraud

  public excitement became so great that the reward for
the capture of prince of space dead or alive was
raised from ten to fifteen million eagles

  twenty-four hours later after he had been landed on
trainors tower bill was waiting there again with
bright stars above him and the carpet of fire that was
new york spread in great squares beneath him the
slim silver ship came gliding down and hung just be-
side the vitrolite dome while eager hands helped him
through the air-lock beyond he found the prince
waiting with a question in his eyes

  no luck bill grunted hopelessly nobody believed
it and the town was getting too hot for me lucky
i had a getaway

  the prince smiled bitterly as the newspaperman told
of his attempt to enlist the aid of humanity

  about what i expected he said men will act like
men it might be better in the history of the cosmos to
let the martians have this old world they might make
something better of it but i am going to give human-
ity a chance-if i can perhaps man will develop into
something better in a million years

  then there is still a chance-without the vitalium
bill asked eagerly

  not without vitalium we have to go to mars we
must have the metal to fit our flier for the trip but i
have needed vitalium before when i could not buy it
i took it

  you mean-piracy bill gasped

  am i not the prince of space-notorious inter-
planetary outlaw as you have termed me in your paper
and is not the good of the many more than the good
of the few may i not take a few pounds of metal
from a rich corporation to save the earth for humanity 
i told you to count me in said bill the idea
was just a little revolutionary

  we havent wasted any time while you were in new
york i have means of keeping posted on the shipments
of vitalium from the moon we have found that the sun-
ship triton leaves the moon in about twenty hours with
three months production of the vitalium mines in the
kepler crater it should be well over two tons

thirty hours later the red rover was drifting at
rest in the lunar lane with ray tubes dead and no
light showing men at her telescopes scanned the heavens
moonward for sight of the white repulsion rays of the
triton and her convoy

  bill was with captain brand in the bridge-room
eager light flashed in brands eyes as he peered through
the telescopes watched his instruments and spoke brisk
orders into the tube

  how does it feel to be a pirate bill asked after
so many years spent hunting them down

  captain brand grinned you know he said ive
wanted to be a buccaneer ever since i was about four
years old i couldnt of course so i took the next best
thing and hunted them im not exactly grieving my
heart out over what has happened but i feel sorry for
my old pals of the moon patrol somebody is going to
get hurt

  and it may be we said bill the triton will be
convoyed by several war-fliers and she can fight with
her own rays it looks to me like a hard nut to crack
i used to dream about how i would take a ship if i
were the prince of space said captain brand ive
just been talking our course of action over with him
weve agreed on a plan

  in an hour the prince and dr trainor entered the
bridge paula appeared in a few moments her face
was drawn and pale unhappiness cast a shadow in her
brown eyes eagerly she asked the prince how he was
feeling

  oh about as well as ever thanks the lean young
man replied in a careless voice his dark enigmatic eyes
fell upon her face he must have noticed her pallor and
evident unhappiness he met her eyes for a moment
then took a quick step toward her bill saw a great ten-
derness almost breaking past the bitter cynicism in those
dark eyes then the prince checked himself spoke
shortly

  we are preparing for action paula perhaps you
should go back to your stateroom until it is over


amazing stories

  the girl turned silently and moved out of the room
bill thought she would have tottered and fallen if-there
had been enough gravity or acceleration to make one fall

  in a few minutes a little group of flickering lights ap-
peared among the stars ahead just beside the huge
crater-scarred golden disk of the moon

  the triton and her convoy shouted the men at the
telescopes

  all men to their stations and clear the ship for
action captain brand gave the order

  two moon patrol sunships are ahead cruising fifty
miles apart came the word from the telescope a hun-
dred miles behind them is the triton with two more
patrol fliers twenty-five miles behind her and fifty miles
apart

  brand spoke to the prince who nodded and brand
gave the order

  show no lights work the ship around with the
gyroscopes until our rear battery of tubes will cover the
right patrol ship of the leading pair and our bow tubes
the other

  the whir of the electric motors came from below the
fliers swung about hanging still in the path of the ap-
proaching triton

  all ready sir came a voice from the tube

  a few anxious minutes went by then the red
rover dark and silent was hanging squarely between
the two forward patrol ships about twenty-five miles
from each of them

  fire constantly with all tubes fore and aft until
the enemy appears to be disabled brand gave the order
the prince spoke to him and he added inflict no un-
necessary damage

  dazzling white rays flashed from the tubes swiftly
they found the two forward sunships the slender octa-
gons of silver shone white under the rays they reeled
whirled about end over end under the terrific pressure
of atomic bombardment in a moment they glowed with
dull red incandescence swiftly became white a bluish
haze spread about them- the discharge of the electric
energy carried by the atoms which would electrocute
any man not insulated against it

  from the three other ships flaming white rays darted
searching for the red rover but they had hardly
found the mark when brand ordered his rays snapped
out the two vessels he had struck were but whirling
masses of incandescent wreckage-completely out of the
battle though most of the men aboard them still sur-
vived in their insulated cells

  the prince himself spoke into the tube maneuver
number forty-one drive for the triton

  driven by alternate burst from front and rear motor
tubes the red rover started a curiously irregular course
toward the treasure ship spinning end over end de-
scribing irregular curves she must have been an almost
impossible target

  and twice during each spin when her axis was in
line with the triton all tubes were fired for an instant
striking the treasure ship with a force that reeled and
staggered her leaving her plates half-fused twisted and
broken

  three times a ray caught the red rover for an in-
stant but her amazing maneuvers which had evidently
been long practised by her crew carried her on a course
so erratic and puzzling that the few rays that found her
were soon shaken off

  before the pirate flier reached the triton the treasure

vessel was drifting helpless with all rays out the red
rover passed by her continuing on her dizzily whirling
course until she was directly between the two remaining
fliers

  hold her still the prince then shouted into the tube
and fire all rays fore and aft

blinding opalescent rays jetted viciously from the
two rings of tubes since the red rover lay be-
tween the two vessels they could not avoid firing upon
each other her own rays being fired in opposite direc-
tions served to balance each other and hold her at rest
while the rays of the enemy as well as those of the pi-
rate that impinged upon them tended to send them into
spinning flight through space

  blinding fluorescence obscured the vitrolite panels
and the stout walls of the red rover groaned beneath
the pressure of the hail of atoms upon them swiftly
they would heat soften collapse or the insulation
would burn away and the electric charge electrocute her
passengers

  the enemy was in a state as bad the white beams
of the pirate flier had found them earlier and could be
held upon them more efficiently it was a contest of
endurance

  suddenly the jets of opalescence snapped off the
pirate bill gazing out into star-dusted space saw the
two patrol vessels spinning in mad flight before the
pressure of the rays glowing white in incandescent
twisted ruin

  a few minutes later the red rover was drifting
beside the triton holding the wrecked treasure-flier with
electromagnetic plates the air-lock of the pirate vessel
opened to release a dozen men in metal vacuum suits
armed with ray pistols and equipped with wrecking tools
and oxygen lances the prince was their leader

  they forced the air-lock of the triton and entered the
wreck in a few minutes grotesque metal-suited figures
appeared again carrying heavy leaden tubes filled with
the precious vitalium

  the red rover was speeding into space an hour later
under full power the prince of space was in the
bridge room with bill captain brand dr trainor and
paula bill noticed that the girl seemed pathetically
joyous at the princes safety though he gave her scant
attention

  we have the two tons of vitalium said the prince
nearly forty-six hundred pounds in fact easily
enough to furnish power for the voyage to mars we
have the metal-provided we can get away with it

  is there still danger paula inquired nervously

  yes most of the passengers of the triton were
still alive when i gave her captain my card he told
me that they sent a heliographic sos as soon as we
attacked some forty or fifty fliers of the moon patrol
will be hot on our trail

  the red rover flew on into space under all her
power presently the lookouts picked up a score of tiny
flickering points of light behind them the moon patrol
was in hot pursuit

  old friends of mine said captain brand every
one of them would give his life to see us caught and
i suppose every one of them feels now that he has a
slice of that fifteen million eagles reward the moon
patrol never gives up and never admits defeat

  tense anxious hours went by while every battery
was delivering its maximum current and every motor
the prince of space



tube was operating at its absolutely highest potential

  paula waited on the bridge anxiously solicitous for
the princes health-he was still pale and weak from the
adventure in the desert presently evidently noticing
how tired and worried she looked he sent her to her
stateroom to rest she went in tears

  no chance to fight if they run us down said cap-
tain brand we can handle four but not forty

  time dragged heavily the red rover flew out into
space past the moon on such a course as would not
draw pursuit toward the city of space her maximum
acceleration was slightly greater than that of the moon
patrol fliers because of the greater number and power
of her motor tubes steadily she forged away from her
pursuers

  at last the flickering lights behind could be seen no
longer

  but the red rover continued in a straight line at the
top of her speed for many hours before she turned and
slipped cautiously toward the secret city of space she
reached it in safety was let through the air-lock once
more bill looked out upon the amazing city upon the in-
ner wall of a spinning cylinder pie enjoyed the re-
markable experience of a walk along a street three miles
in length which brought him up in an unbroken curve
and back to where he had started

  it took a week to refit the red rover in preparation
for the voyage to mars her motor ray tubes were re-
built and additional vitalium generators installed the
precious metal taken from the triton was built into new
batteries to supply power for the long voyage good
stocks of food water and compressed oxygen were
taken aboard as well as weapons and scientific equip-
ment of all variety

  we start for mars in thirty minutes captain brand
told bill when the warning gong had called him and
the others aboard

chapter vi

the red star of war

the red rover slipped out through the great aii-
lock of the city of space and put her bow toward
mars the star of the war-god hung before her
in the silver-dusted darkness of the faint constellation
of capricornus a tiny brilliant disk of ocherous red
the prince of space outlawed by the world of his birth
was hurtling out through space in a mad attempt to save
that world from the horrors of martian invasion

  the red point that was mars hung almost above them
it seemed almost in the center of the vitrolite dome of
the bridge we are not heading directly for the
planet captain brand told bill its orbital velocity
must be considered we are moving toward the point
that it will occupy in twenty days

  we can make it in twenty days three million miles
a day

  easily if the vitalium holds out and if we dont
collide with a meteorite there is no limit to speed in
space certainly no practical limit acceleration is the
important question

  we may collide with a meteorite you say is there
much danger

  a good deal the meteorites travel in swarms which
follow regular orbits about the sun we have accurate
charts of the swarms whose orbits cross those of the

earth and moon now we are entering unexplored terri-
tory and most of them are so small of course that no
telescope would reveal them in time merely little peb-
bles moving with a speed about a dozen times that of
a bullet from an old-fashioned rifle

  and what are we going to do if we live to get to
mars 

  a big question brand grinned we could hardly
mop up a whole planet with the motor rays trainor
has a few of his rocket torpedoes but not enough to
make much impression upon a belligerent planet the
prince and trainor have a laboratory rigged up down
below they are doing a lot of work a new weapon
i understand i dont know what will come of it
presently bill found his way down the ladder to the
laboratory he found the prince of space and dr
trainor hard at work he learned little by watching
them save that they were experimenting upon small
animals green plants and samples of the rare vitalium
high tension electricity electron tubes and various
rays seemed to be in use

  noticing his interest the prince said you know that
vitalium was first discovered in vitamins in infinitesimal
quantities the metal seems to be at the basis of all
life it is the trace of vitalium in chlorophyl which en-
ables the green leaves of plants to utilize the energy of
sunlight we are trying to determine the nature of the
essential force of life-we know that the question is
bound up with the radioactivity of vitalium we have
made a good deal of progress and complete success
would give us a powerful instrumentality

  paula was working with them in the laboratory mak-
ing a capable and eager assistant-she had been her
fathers helper since her girlhood bill noticed that she
seemed happy only when near the prince that the weight
of unhappiness and trouble left her brown eyes only
when she was able to help him with some task or when
her skill brought a word or glance of approval from him

  the prince himself seemed entirely absorbed in his
work he treated the girl courteously enough but seemed
altogether impersonal toward her to him she seemed
only to be a fellow-scientist yet bill knew that the
prince was aware of the girls feelings-and he suspect-
ed that the prince was trying to stifle a growing re-
ciprocal emotion of his own

  bill spent long hours on the bridge with captain
brand staring out at the star-scattered midnight of
space the earth shrank quickly until it was a tiny
green disk with the moon an almost invisible white
speck beside it day by day mars grew larger it
swelled from an ocher point to a little red disk

  often bill scanned the spinning scarlet globe through
a telescope he could see the white polar caps the
dark equatorial regions the black lines of the canals
and after many days he could see the little blue circle
that had been visible in the giant telescope on trainors
tower

  it must be something enormous to stand out so
plainly he said when he showed it to captain brand

  i suppose so even now we could see nothing with
a diameter of less than a mile or so

  if its a ship it must be darned big-big enough for
the whole race of em to get aboard

  bill was standing a few hours later gazing out
through the vitrolite panels at the red-winged splendor
of the sun when suddenly he heard a series of terrific
crashes the ship rocked and trembled beneath him he


amazing stories

heard the reverberation of hammered metal and the

hiss of escaping air

  meteorite screamed brand

  wildly he pointed to the vitrolite dome above in
three places the heavy crystal was shattered a little hole
drilled through it surrounded with radiating cracks
in two other sections the heavy metal wall was dented
through the holes the air was hissing out it formed a
white cloud outside and glistening frost gathered quickly
on the crystal panels

  bill felt the air suddenly drawn from his lungs he
gasped for breath the bridge was abruptly cold little
particles of snow danced across it

  the air is going brand gasped well suffocate

  he touched a lever and a heavy cover fell across the
ladder shaft locked itself making the floor an airtight
bulkhead

  thats right bill tried to say give others-
chance

  his voice had failed a soaring came in his ears he
felt as if a malignant giant were sucking out his breath
the room grew dark swam about him he reeled he
was blind a sudden chill came over his limbs-the in-
finite cold of space he felt hot blood spurting from
his nose freezing on his face faintly he heard brand
moving as he staggered and fell into unconsciousness

when he looked about again air and warmth were
coming back he saw that the shaft was still
sealed but air was hissing into the room through a valve
captain brand lay inert beside him on the floor he
looked up at the dome saw that soft rubber patches had
been placed over the holes where air-pressure held them
fast the captain had saved the ship before he fell

  in a moment the door opened dr trainor rushed
in with prince and others behind him they picked up
the unconscious brand and rushed him down to the in-
firmary the plucky captain had been almost asphy-
xiated but administration of pure oxygen restored him
to consciousness on the following day he was back on
the bridge

  the red rover had been eighteen days out from the
city of space the loss of air due to collision with the
meteorites had brought inconveniences but good prog-
ress had been made it was only two more days to
mars the forward tubes had been going many hours
to retard the ship

  object dead ahead called a lookout from his tele-
scope

  a small blue globe coming directly toward us he
added a moment later

  another of their ships setting out for the earth
brand muttered it will about cook our goose

  in a few moments the prince and dr trainor had
rushed up the ladder from the laboratory the blue
globe was rushing swiftly toward them and the red
rover was plunging forward at many thousand miles
per hour

  we cant run from it said brand it is still fifty
thousand miles away but we are going far too fast to
stop in that distance we will pass it in about five
minutes

  if we cant stop we go ahead the prince said
smiling grimly

  we might try a torpedo on em suggested dr
trainor he had mounted a tube to fire his rocket tor-
pedoes from the bridge it will have all the speed its

own motor rays can develop plus what the ship has at
present plus the relative velocity of the globe that
might carry it through

  the prince nodded assent

  trainor slipped a slender gleaming rocket into his
tube sighted it moved the lever that set the projectile to
spinning and fired the little white flame of the motor
rays dwindled and vanished ahead of them quickly
trainor fired again and then a third time

  switch off the rays and darken the lights the prince
ordered with combined speeds of ten thousand miles
a minute we might pass them without being seen-if
they havent sighted us already

  for long seconds they hurtled onward in tense silence
bill was at a telescope against the silver and black
background of space the little blue disk of the martian
ship was growing swiftly

  suddenly a bright purple spark appeared against the
blue grew swiftly brighter

  an atomic bomb he cried they saw us we are
lost

  he tensed himself waiting for the purple flash that
would mean the end but the words were hardly out
of his mouth when he saw a tiny sheet of violet flame
far ahead of them it flared up suddenly and vanished
as abruptly the blue disk of the ship still hung before
them but the purple spark was gone for a moment he
was puzzled then he understood

  the atomic bomb struck a torpedo he shouted its

exploded and if they think it was we-

  perhaps they cant see us with the rays out brand
said

  it is unlikely trainor observed that the bomb ac-
tually struck one of our torpedoes more likely it was
set to be detonated by the gravitational attraction of any
object that passed near it

  still watching the azure globe bill saw a sudden flare
of orange light against it a great burst of yellow flame
 he blue ball crumpled behind the flame the orange
went out and the blue vanished with it only twisted
scraps of white metal were left

  the second torpedo struck the martian bill cried
and you notice that the blue went out said dr
trainor it must be merely a vibratory screen

  the red rover hurtled on through space toward the
crimson planet that hour by hour and minute by minute
expanded before her the blue disk was now plainly
visible against the red it was apparently a huge globe
of azure similar to the ships they had met but at least a
mile in diameter she lay just off the red desert near
an important junction of canals

  some huge machine screened by the blue wall of
vibration dr trainor suggested

  during the last two days the prince and dr trainor
and their eager assistant paula had worked steadily
in the laboratory without pause for rest bill was with
them when the prince threw down his pencil and an-
nounced the result of his last calculation

  the problem is solved he said and its answer
means both success and failure we have mastered the
secret of life we have unlocked the mystery of the
ages a terrific force is at our command-a force great
enough to sweep man to the millennium or to wipe out
a planet but that force is useless without the appara-
tus to release it

  we have the laboratory- trainor began

  but we lack one essential thing we must have a
the prince of space



small amount of cerium one of the rare earth metals
for the electrode you know inside the vitalium grid
in our new vacuum tube and there is not a gram of
cerium in all our supplies

  we can go back to the earth- said trainor

  that will mean forty days gone before we could
come back-more than forty because we would have to
stop at the city of space to refit and all the perils of
the meteorites again i am sure that in less than forty
days the martians will be putting the machine in that
enormous blue globe to its dreadful use

  then we must land on mars and find the metal
said captain brand who had been listening by the door

  exactly said the prince you will pick out a spot
that looks deserted at a great distance from the blue
globe somewhere in the mountains as far back as pos-
sible from the canals land there just after midnight
we will have mining and prospecting equipment ready
to go to work when day comes almost any sort of ore
ought to yield the small quantity of cerium we need
very good sir said brand

a few hours later the red rover was sweeping
around mars on a long curve many thousands of
miles from the surface of the red planet

  well pick out the spot to land while the sun is shin-
ning on it captain brand told bill then we can keep
over it as it sweeps around into the shadow timing our-
selves to land just after midnight

  isnt there danger tliat we may be seen

  of course we can only minimize it by keeping a
few thousand miles above the surface as long as it is day
and landing at night and in a deserted section

  as they drew nearer the telescope revealed the sur-
face of the hostile planet more distinctly bill peered
intently into an eyepiece scanning the red globe for signs
of it malignant inhabitants

  the canals seem to be strips of greenish vegetation
irrigated from some sort of irrigation system that brings
water from the melting ice-caps he said

  lowell the old american astronomer knew that two
hundred years ago said captain brand though some
of his contemporaries claimed that they could not see the
canals 

  i can make out low green trees and metal structures
i think there are long pipes as well as open channels
to spread the water and i see a great dome of white
metal-it must be five hundred feet across    there
are several of them in sight mostly located where the
canals intersect

  they might be great community buildings-cities
suggested brand on account of the dust-storms that
so often hide the surface of the planet it would probably
be necessary to cover a city up in some way

and i see something moving a little blue dot it
seems probably a little flier on the same order as those
we have seen but only a few feet in diameter it seemed
to be sailing from one of the white domes to another
brand moved to another telescope

  yes i see them two in one place they seem to
be floating along high and fast and just to the right
is a whole line of them flying one behind the other
crossing a patch of red desert

  whats this  bill cried in some excitement looks
like animals of some kind in a pen they look like
people almost

  what let me see

  brand rushed over from his telescope bill relin-
quished him the instrument see just above the
center of the field right in the edge of that cultivated
strip by what looks like a big aluminum water-pipe

  yes yes i see something a big stockade and
it has things in it but not men i think they are gray
and hairy but they seem to walk on two legs

  something like apes maybe

  ive got it cried brand theyre domestic ani-
mals the ruling martians are parasites they must
have something to suck blood out of they live on these
creatures

  probably so bill admitted do you suppose they
will keep people penned up that way if they conquer the
world 

  likely he shuddered no good in thinking of
it we must be selecting the place to land

  he returned to his instrument

  ive got it he said presently a low mountain
in a big sweep of red desert about sixty degrees north
of the equator not a canal or a white dome in a hun-
dred miles

  long hours went by while the red rover hung above
the chosen landing place waiting for it to sweep into the
shadow of night bill peered intently through his tele-
scope watching the narrow strips of vegetation across
the bare stretches of orange desert he studied the
bright metal and gray masonry of irrigation works the
widely scattered white metal domes that seemed to
cover cities the hurtling blue globes that flashed in swift
flight between them two or three times he caught sight
of a tiny creeping green thing that he thought was one
of the hideous blood-sucking martians and he saw
half a dozen broad metal pens or pastures in which the
hairy gray bipeds were confined

  shining machines were moving across the green strips
of fertile land evidently cultivating them

  the prince dr trainor and paula were asleep in
their staterooms bill retired for a short rest came
back to find the planet beneath them in darkness the
red rover was dropping swiftly with captain brand
still at the bridge

  rapidly the stars vanished in an expanding circle be-
low them phobos and deimos the small moons of
mars hurtling across the sky with different velocities
shed scant light upon the barren desert below cap-
tain brand eased the ship down using the rays as little
as possible to cut down the danger of detection

  the red rover dropped silently to the center of a low
cliff-rimmed plateau that rose from the red sandy desert
in the faint light of stars and hurtling moons the och-
erous waste lay flat in all directions-there are no high
mountains on mars the air was clear and so thin
that the stars shone with hot brilliance almost bill
thought as if the ship were still out in space

  silent hours went by as they waited for dawn the
thin white disk of the nearer moon slid down beneath
the black eastern horizon and rose again to make another
hurtling flight

  just before dawn the prince appeared an eager smile
on his alert lean face evidently well recovered from the
long struggling in the laboratory

  ive all the mining machinery ready captain brand
told him we can get out as soon as its warm enough
-its a hundred and fifty below zero out there now

  it ought to warm up right soon after sunrise-thin
as this air is you seem to have picked about the lone-


amazing stories

liest spot on the planet all right theres a lot of danger
though that we may be discovered before we get the
cerium

  funny feeling to be the first men on a new world
said bill

  but were not the first the prince said i am sure
that envers landed on mars-i think the martian ships
are based on a study of his machinery

  envers may have waited here in the desert for the
sun to rise just as we are doing murmured brand
in fact if he wanted to look around without being seen
he may have landed right near here this is probably
the best place on the planet to land without being detec-
ted

chapter vii

a mine on mars

the sun came up small and white and hot shin-
ing from a black sky upon an endless level orange
waste of rocks and sand broken with a black
swamp in the distant north even from the eminence
of the time-worn plateau the straight horizon seemed
far nearer than on earth due to the greater curvature of
the planets surface

  men were gathering about the air-lock under the di-
rection of the prince assembling mining equipment

  shall we be able to go out without vacuum suits
bill asked captain brand

  i think so when it gets warm enough the air is
light-the amount of oxygen at the surface is about
equal to that in the air nine miles above sea level on
earth but the pull of gravity here is only about one-
third as much as it is on the earth and less oxygen will
be required to furnish energy i think we can stand it
if we dont take too much exertion

  the rays of the oddly small sun beat fiercely through
the thin air soon the prince went into the air-lock
closed the inner door behind him and started the pumps
when the dial showed the pressures equalized he opened
the outer door and stepped out upon the red rocks

  all were watching him intently through the vitrolite
panels paula clasped her hands in nervous anxiety
bill saw the prince step confidently out sniff the air as
though testing it and take a few deep breaths then he
drew his legs beneath him and made an astounding leap
that carried him twenty feet high he fell in a long arc
struck on his shoulder in a pile of loose red sand he
got up gasping for air as if the effort had exhausted
him and staggered back to the airlock quickly he
sealed the outer door behind him opened the valve and
raised the pressure

  feels funny he said when he opened the inner door
like trying to breathe on top of a mountain-only more
so the jump was great fun but rather exhausting i
imagine it would be dangerous for a fellow with a weak
heart all right to come out now air is still cool
but the rocks are getting hot under the sun

  he held open the door the guards will come first
six of the thirty-odd members of the crew had been
detailed to act as guards to prevent surprise each was
to carry two rocket torpedoes-such a burden was not
too much upon this planet with its lesser gravity they
would watch from the cliffs at the edge of the little
plateau upon which the sunship had landed

bill and four other men entered the air-lock-and

paula the girl had insisted upon having some duty
assigned to her and this had seemed easier than the
mining

  the door was closed behind them the air pumped out
until bill gasped for breath and heard a drumming in
his ears then the outer door was opened and they
looked out upon mars motion was easy yet the slight-
est effort was tiring bill found himself panting merely
from the exertion of lifting the two heavy torpedoes to
his shoulders

  with paula behind him he stepped through the outer
door the air felt chill and thin loose red sand crum-
bled yieldingly under their feet

  they separated at the door bill starting toward the
south end of the pleateau paula toward the north point
and the men going to stations along the sides

  just lie at the top of the cliffs and watch the prince
had ordered when you have anything to report flash
with your ray pistols in code signal every thirty min-
utes anyhow we will have a man watching from the
bridge report to him anything moving we will fire
off a red signal rocket when you are to come back

  he had tried to keep paula from going out but the
girl had insisted at last he had agreed

  better to have you keeping watch than handling a
pick and shovel or pushing a barrow he had told her
but i hate to see you go so far off something might
happen if they find us though they will probably get
us all dont get hurt

  bill had seen the prince looking anxiously at the
slender brown-eyed girl as they entered the air-lock he
had seen him move forward quickly as though to ask
her to come back-move forward and then turn aside
with a flush that became a bitterly cynical smile

  as bill walked across the top of the barren red
plateau he looked back at the girl moving slowly in the
opposite direction he had glanced at her eyes as they
left the ship they were shadowed heavy-lidded in
their brown depths lurked despair and tragic determina-
tion bill watching her now thought that all life had
gone out of her she seemed a dull automaton driven
only by the energy of a determined will all hope and
life and vivacity had gone from her manner yet she
walked as if she had a stern task to do

  i wonder- bill muttered can she mean-sui-
cide

  he turned uncertainly as if to go after her then
deciding that his thought was mere fancy he trudged on
across the red plateau to his station

  behind him he saw other parties emerging from the
air-lock the prince and dr trainor were setting up
apparatus of some kind probably bill thought to take
magnetic and meteorological observations men with
prospecting hammers were scattering over all the
plateau

  almost any sort of ferruginous rock is sure to con-
tain the tiny amount of cerium we need dr trainor
had said

bill reached the end of the plateau the age-worn
cliffs of red granite and burned lava fell sheer for
a hundred feet to a long slope of talus below the
rubble of sand and boulders the flat desert stretched
away almost visibly curving to vanish beneath the near
red horizon

  it was a desolate and depressing scene this view of a
dead and sun-baked planet there was no sign of living
the prince of space



thing no moving object no green of life-the canals
with their verdure were far out of sight

  hard to realize theres a race of vampires across
there living in great metal domes bill muttered as he
threw himself fiat on the rocks at the lip of the precipice
and leveled one of the heavy torpedoes before him but
i dont blame em for wanting to go to a more cheerful
world

  looking behind him he soon saw men busy with elec-
tric drills not a hundred yards from the slender silver
cylinder that was the red rover the earth quivered be-
neath him as a shot was set off and he saw a great foun-
tain of crushed rock thrown into the air

  men with barrows an hour later were wheeling the
crushed rock to gleaming electrical reducing apparatus
that dr trainor and the prince were setting up beside
the sunship evidently there had been no difficulty in
finding ore that carried a satisfactory amount of cerium

  bill continued to scan the orange-red desert below
him through the powerful telescope along the rocket
tube he kept his watch before him and at half-hour
intervals sent the three short flashes with his ray pistol
which meant all is well

  two hours must have gone by before he saw the blue
globe it came into view low over the red rim of the
desert below him crept closer on a wavering path

  martian ship in view he signalled a blue globe
about ten feet in diameter follows curious winding
course as if following something

  keep rocket trained upon it came the cautiously
flashed reply fire if it observes us

  globe following animals he flashed back two
grayish bipeds leaping before it running with marvel-
ous agility

  he was peering through the telescope sight of the
rocket tube keeping the cross hairs upon the little blue
globe he could still see the creatures that fled before it
they were almost like men-or erect hairy apes bi-
peds they were with human-like arms and erect heads
covered with short gray hair or fur they carried no
weapons

  they fled from the globe at a curious leaping run
which carried them over the flat red desert with remark-
able speed they came straight for the foot of the cliff
from which bill watched the blue globe close behind
them when one of them stumbled over a block of
lava and fell sprawling headlong on the sand the other
gray creature stopped to help it the blue globe stopped
too hanging still twenty feet above the red sand waited
for them to rise and run desperately on again

  bill felt a quick flood of sympathy for the gray crea-
tures one had stopped to help the other that meant
that they felt affection and the globe had waited for
them to run again it seemed to be baiting them mali-
ciously almost he fired the rocket but his orders had
been not to fire unless the ship were discovered

  now they were not a mile away suddenly bill per-
ceived a tiny light-gray object grasped close to the breast
of one of the gray bipeds evidently it was a young one
in the arms of its mother the other creature seemed
a male it was the mother that had fallen

  they came on toward the cliff

  they were very clearly in view and not five hundred
yards below when the female fell again the male
stopped to aid her and the globe poised itself above
them waited the mother seemed unable to rise the
other creature lifted her and she fell limply back

  as if in rage the gray male sprang toward the blue
globe crouching

  a tiny purple spark leapt from it a flash of violet
fire enveloped him he was flung twisted and sprawl-
ing to the ground burned and torn and bleeding he
drew himself to all fours and crept on toward the blue
globe

  suddenly the sphere dropped to the ground a round
panel swung open in its side-it was turned from bill
so that he could not see within green things crept out
they were creatures like the one he had seen in the
mexican desert-a cluster of slender flexible green
tentacles with suction disks an insignificant green body
and three malevolent purple eyes at the ends of foot-
long stalks

  there were three of the things

  the creeping male flung himself madly upon one of
them it coiled itself about him suction disks fastened
themselves against his skin for a time he writhed and
struggled fighting in agony against the squeezing green
coils then he was still

  one of the things grasped the little gray object in the
mothers arms she fought to shield it to cover it with
her own body it was torn away from her hidden in
the hideously writhing green coils

  the third of the monsters flung itself upon the mother
wrapping snake-like tentacles about her dragging her
struggling body down shuddering and writhing in agony
while the blood of life was sucked from it

  bill watched silent and trembling with horror

  the things chased them-for funhe muttered
fiercely just a sample of what it will be on the earth-
if we dont stop em

  presently the green monsters left their victims-which
were now mere shriveled husks they dragged them-
selves back into the blue globe which rose swiftly into
the air the round panel had closed

  from his station on the cliff bill watched the thing
through the telescope sight of the rocket keeping the
cross hairs upon it it came up to his own level-above
it suddenly it paused he was sure that the things
in it had seen the red rover

  quickly he pressed a little nickeled lever a soft
whir came from the rocket tube he pressed the red
button the torpedo leapt forward with the white rays
driving back the empty shell was flung back in bills
hand

  a great burst of vivid orange flame enveloped the co-
balt globe it disintegrated into a rain of white metal
fragments

  take that damn you he muttered in fierce satis-
faction

  globe brought down successfully he flashed evi-
dently it had sighted us green martians from it had
killed gray bipeds may i inspect remains

  you may permission was flashed back from the
prince but be absent not over half an hour

  in a moment another message came all lookouts
be doubly alert globe may be searched for miners
making good progress we can leave by sunset cour-
age -the prince

strapping the remaining rocket torpedo to his
shoulders and thrusting his ray pistol ready in his
belt bill walked back along the brink of the precipice
until he saw a comparatively easy way to the red plain
below and scrambled over the rim erosion of untold


amazing stories

ages had left cracks and irregularities in the rock be-
cause of the slighter gravity of mars it was a simple feat
to support his weight with the grip of his fingers on a
ledge in five minutes he had clambered down to the
bank of talus hurriedly he scrambled down over great
fallen boulders panting and gasping for breath in the
thin air

  he reached the red sand of the plain-it was worn
by winds of ages into an impalpable scarlet dust that
rose in a thin murky cloud about him and settled in a
blood-colored stain upon his perspiring limbs the dry
dust yielded beneath his feet as he made his way to-
ward the silent gray bodies making his progress most
difficult

  almost exhausted he reached the gray creatures ex-
amined them they were far different from human
beings despite obvious similarities each of their
hands had but three clawed digits a curious disk-
like appendage took the place of the nose in skeletel
structure they were far different from homo sapiens

  wearily bill trudged back to the towering red cliff
red dust swirling up about him he was oddly ex-
hausted by his exertions trifling as they had been the
murky red dust he inhaled was irritating to his nostrils
he choked and sneezed sweat ran in muddy red streams
from his body and he was suddenly very thirsty

  all the top of the red granite plateau-it was evidently
the stone heart of an ancient mountain-was hidden
from him he could see nothing of the red rover or
any of her crew he could see no living thing

  the flat plain of red dust lay about him curving below
a near horizon lbose dust sucked at his feet rose about
him in a suffocating saffron cloud the sun a little
crimson globe in a blue-black sky shone blisteringly
the sky was soberly dark cold and hostile in alarmed
haste he struggled toward the grim line of high red
cliffs

  then he saw a round white object in the red sand

  pausing to gasp for breath and to rub the sweat and
red mud from his forehead he kicked at it curiously
a sun-bleached human skull rolled out of the scarlet
dust he knew at once that it was human not a skull
of a creature like the gray things behind him on the sand

  with the unpleasant feeling that he was opening the
forbidden book of some forgotten tragedy he fell to his
knees in the dust and scooped about with his fingers
his right had closed upon a mans thigh bone his left
caught in a rotten leather belt that pulled a human verte-
bra out of the dust the belt had a tarnished silver
buckle and he looked at it with a gasp

  it bore an elaborate initial e

  e he muttered envers he got to mars and
died here trying to get to the mountain i guess
lord what a death a man all alone in the dust and
the sun a strange world strange monsters

  the loneliness of the red desert the mystery of it
and its alien spirit wrapped itself about him like a
mantle of fear he staggered to his feet and set off at
a stumbling run through the sand toward the cliff but
in a moment he paused

  he might have left something he muttered

  he turned and plodded back to where he had left
the skull and the rotted belt and dug again with his
fingers he found the rest of the skeleton even bits of
hair clothing and human skin preserved in the dry dust
he found an empty canteen a rusty pocketknife but-
tons coins and a ray pistol that was burned out

   then his plowing fingers brought up a little black
book from the dust

   it was envers diary

   most of it was still legible it is available in printed
form today and gives a detailed account of the tragic
venture the hopeful starting from earth the dangers
and discouragements of the voyage a mutiny half the
crew killed the thrill of landing on a new planet the
attack of the blue globes how they took the ship
carried their prisoners to the pens where they tried to
use them to breed a new variety of domestic animals
envers escape his desperate attempt to find the ship
where they had landed in the desert

   bill did not read it all then he took time to read only
that last tragic entry

   water all gone see now i will never reach mountain
where i landed probably they have moved sunship
anyhow might have been better to have stayed in the
pen food and water there    but how could god
create such things so hideous so malignant i pray
they will not use my ship to go to earth i hoped to find
and destroy it but it is too late

   thick red dust swirled up in bills face he tried
to breathe choked and sneezed and strangled looking
up from the yellowed pages of the dead explorers note-
book he saw great clouds of red dust hiding the darkly
blue sky in the east it seemed almost that a colossal
red-yellowed cylinder was being rolled swiftly upon
him from eastward

   a dust-storm was upon him one of the terrific dust-
storms of mars so fierce that they are visible to astron-
omers across forty million miles of space

   clutching the faded note-book he ran across the sand
again toward the red cliffs the wind howled behind
him overtook him and came screaming about his ears
red dust fogged chokingly about his head the line
of cliffs before him vanished in a murky red haze the
wind blew swiftly yet it was thin exerting little force
the dusty air became an acrid fluid choking unbreath-
able

  blindly he staggered on toward the rocks he
reached them fought his way up the bank of talus
scrambling over gigantic blocks of lava the base of
the cliff was before him a massive perpendicular wall
rising out of sight in red haze he skirted it saw a
climbable chimney scrambled up

   at last he drew himself over the top and lay flat
scarlet dust-clouds swirled about him he could not see
twenty yards he made no attempt to find the red
rover he knew he could not locate it in the dust

hours passed as he lay there blinded suffocating
feeling the hot misery of acrid dust and perspi-
ration caked in a drying mud upon his skin thin winds
screamed about the rocks hot as a furnace-blast he
leveled his torpedo tried to watch but he could see
only a murky wall of red with the sun biting through
it like a tiny round blood-ruby

  the red sun had been near the zenith slowly it
crept down toward an unseen horizon it alone gave
him an idea of direction and of the passage of time
then it too vanished in the dust

   suddenly the wind was still the dust settled slowly
in half an hour the red sun came into view again just
above the red western horizon objects about the
mile-long plateau began to take shape the red rover
still lay where she had been in the center men were
the prince of space



still busily at work at the mining machinery-they had
struggled on through the storm

   all lookouts signal reports the prince flashed from
the ship

  found envers body and brought his diary bill
flashed when it came his turn

  now preparing to depart came from the prince
getting apparatus aboard have the required cerium
return signal will be fired soon

   bill watched the dusty sky over whose formerly dark-
blue face the storm had drawn a yellowish haze in a
few minutes he saw a blue globe then another and
a third they were far toward the southeast drifting
high and fast through the saffron haze it seemed that
they were searching out the route over which the globe
that he had brought down must have come

 three globe-ships in sight he signalled approach-
ing us

   some of the other lookouts had evidently seen them
for he saw the flicker of other ray pistols across the
plateau

  without preamble the red signal rocket was fired
bill heard the report of it-sharp and thin in the rare
atmosphere he saw the livid scarlet flare

   he got to his feet shouldered the heavy rocket tube
and ran stumbling back to the red rover he saw other
men running saw men struggling to get the mining
machinery back on the ship

   looking back he saw the three blue globes swimming
swiftly nearer then he saw others a full score of them
they were far off tiny circles of blue in the saffron sky
they seemed to be rapidly flying toward the red rover

  he looked expectantly northward toward the end
of the plateau to which paula had gone he saw noth-
ing of her she was not returning in answer to the
signal rocket

  he was utterly exhausted when he reached the sun-
ship panting gasping for the thin air the others were
all like himself caked with dried red mud gasping asth-
matically from exertion and excitement men were
struggling to get pieces of heavy machinery aboard the
flier-vitalium power generators that had been used to
heat the furnaces and even a motor ray tube that had
been borrowed from the ships power plant for emer-
gency use in the improvised smelter

  the prince and dr trainor were laboring furiously
over an odd piece of apparatus on the red sand beside
the silver sunship they had set up a tripod on which was
mounted a curious glistening device there were lenses
prisms condensers mirrors the core of it seemed to
be a strange vacuum tube-which had an electrode of
cerium surrounded with a queer vitalium grid a tiny
filament was glowing in it and the induction coil which
powered the tube fed by vitalium batteries was buzzing
incessantly

   better get aboard and off bill cried no use to
lose our lives our chance to save the world-just for a
little mining machinery

   the prince looked up in a moment leaving the queer
little device to dr trainor look at the martian
ships he cried sweeping out an arm must be thirty
in sight swarming up like flies we couldnt get away
and against those purple atomic bombs the torpedoes
wouldnt have a chance besides we have some of the
ships machinery out here some generators and a ray
tube

   bill looked up saw the swarming blue globes circling

above them in the saffron sky some of them not a mile
above he shrugged hopelessly then looked anxiously
off to the north again scanning the red plateau

  paula whats become of her he demanded
paula is she gone the prince turned from the
tripod looked around suddenly paula what could
have happened to her 

  a broken heart has happened to her bill told him

  you think-you think- stammered the prince

there was sudden alarm in his dark eyes and a great
tender longing his bitterly cynical smile was gone
bill she cant be gone he cried almost in agony
you know she was on lookout duty at the north end
of the plateau she hasnt come back

  ive got to find her

  what is it to you  i thought you didnt care bill
was stern

  i thought i didnt except as a friend but i was
wrong if shes gone bill-it will kill me

  the prince spun about with abrupt decision

  get everything aboard and fit the ship to take off
as soon as possible he ordered dr trainor is in
command give him any help he needs brand test
everything when the tube is replaced keep the ship
ready to fly he turned swiftly to trainor who still
worked deftly over the glittering little machine on the
tripod doc you can operate that by yourself as well
as if i were here do your best-for mankind im go-
ing to find your daughter

   trainor nodded in silent assent his fingers busy

  the prince sticking a ray pistol in his belt set off
at a desperate run toward the north end of the plateau
after a moments hesitation bill staggered along be-
hind him still carrying the rocket torpedo strapped to
his back

  it was only half a mile to the end of the plateau in
a few minutes the prince was there bill staggered up
just as he was reading a few scrawled words on a scrap
of paper that he had found fastened to a boulder where
paula had been stationed

  to the prince of space it ran i cant go on you
must know that i love you-desperately it was mad-
dening to be with you to know that you dont care i
know the story of your life know that you can never
care for me the red dust is blowing now and i am
going down in the desert to die please dont look for
me-it will do no good pardon me for writing this
but i wanted you to know-why i am going because
i love you paula

chapter viii

the vitomaton

t love paula cried the prince it happened
 all at once-when you said she was gone like a
burst of light yet it must have been growing
for weeks it was getting so i couldnt work in the lab
unless she was there god it must have been hard for
her i was fighting it i tried to hide what i was begin-
ning to feel tried to treat her as if she were a man now
-shes gone

  bill looked back to the red rover half a mile behind
them she lay still burnished silver cylinder on the red
sand he could see trainor beside her still working
over the curious little device on the tripod all the
others had gone aboard and a score of blue globe-


amazing stories

ships like little sapphire moons were circling a few
thousand feet above drifting around and around with
a slow gliding motion like buzzards circling over their
carrion-prey

  the prince had buried his face in his hands stand-
ing in an attitude of utter dejection

  bill turned looked over the red flat sand of the mar-
tian desert far below leading toward the near horizon
he saw a winding line of foot-prints half obliterated
by the recent dust-storm far away they vanished below
the blue-black sky

  her tracks he said pointing

  tracks the prince looked up eager hopeful deter-
mination flashing in his dark eyes then we can fol-
low  it may not be too late

  he ran toward the edge of the cliff

  bill clutched his sleeve wait think what youre
doing man were fighting to save the world you
cant run off that way anyhow the sun is low it is
getting cool already in two minutes after the sun goes
down it will be cold as the devil youll die in the des-
ert

  the prince tugged away hang the world if you
knew the way i feel about paula-lord what a fool ive
been to drive her to this

  agony was written on his dark face he bit his thin
lip until blood oozed out and mingled indistinguishably
with the red grime on his face anyhow the vitomaton
is finished trainor can use it as well as i ive got
to find paula-or die trying

  he started toward the brink of the precipice again
after the hesitation of a moment bill started after him
the prince turned suddenly

  what the devil are you doing here 

  well said bill the red rover is not a very attrac-
tive haven of refuge with all those martian ships fly-
ing around it and i have come to think a good deal
of miss paula id like to help you find her

  dont come said the prince probably it is
death-

  im not exactly an infant ive been in tight places
before ive even an idea of what it would be like to die
at night in this desert-i found the bones of a man in
the dust today but i want to go

  the prince grasped bills hand for a moment a
tender smile of friendship came over the drawn mask of
mingled despair and determination upon his lean face

  presently the two of them found an inclining ledge that
ran down the face of the red granite cliff and scrambled
along to the flat plain of acrid dust below in desperate
haste they plodded gasping along following the scant
traces of paulas footprints that the storm had left a
hazy red cloud of dust rose about them stinging their
nostrils hey strangled and gasped for breath in the
thin dusty air sweaty grime covered them with a red
crust

  for a mile they followed the trail then paula had
left the sand for a bare ledge of age-worn volcanic rock
the wind had erased what traces she might have left
here they skirted the edge of the ledge but no prints
were visible in the sand the small red eye of the sun
was just above the ocherous western rim of the planet
their perspiring bodies shivered under the first chill of
the frozen martian night

  its no use bill muttered sitting down on a block
of time-worn granite and wiping the red mud from his
face shes probably been gone for hours no chance

  ive got to find her the prince cried his lean red-
stained face tense with determination ill circle about
a little and see if i cant pick up the trail

  bill sat on the rock he looked back at the low dark
rim of cliffs a mile behind grim and forbidding against
the somber indigo sky the crimson melancholy
splendor of the martian sunset was fading in the west

  the silver sunship was out of sight behind the cliffs
but he could see the little blue globes like spinning
moons of sapphire circling watchfully above it they
were lower now some of them not a thousand feet
above the hidden sunship

  abruptly one of them was enveloped in a vivid flare
of orange light its blue gleam flickering out and it
fell in fragments of twisted white metal bill knew
that it had been struck with a rocket torpedo

  the reply was quick and terrible slender dazzling
shafts of incandescent whiteness stabbed down toward
the ship each of them driving before it a tiny bright
spark of purple fire coruscating iridescent

  they were the atomic bombs bill knew a dozen of
them must have been fired from as many ships in a
few seconds he heard the reports of their explosions-
in the thin still air they were mere sharp cracks like
pistol reports they exploded below the line of his vi-
sion no more torpedoes were fired from the unseen sun-
ship bill could see nothing of it but he was sure that
it had been destroyed

  he heard the princes shout thin and high in the
rare atmosphere it came from a hundred yards beyond
him

  ive found the trail

  bill got up trudged across to follow him the prince
waited impatiently but gasping for breath just half
of the red disk of the sun was visible in the indigo sky
above the straight horizon and a chill breeze blew upon
them

  i guess that ends the chance for the world bill
gasped

  i suppose so some fool must have shot that torpedo
off contrary to orders the vitomaton might have saved
us if trainor had had a chance to use it

  they plodded on through the dust straining their eyes
to follow the half-obliterated trail in the fading light
it grew colder very swiftly for mars has no such thick
blanket atmosphere to hold the heat of day as has the
earth

  twilight was short splendid wings of somber crim-
son flame hung for a moment in the west a brief
golden glow shone where it had been then the sky
was dark and the million stars were standing out in
cold motionless majesty-scintillantly bright unfeeling
watchers of the drama in the desert

  bill felt tingling cold envelope his limbs the sweat
and mud upon him seemed freezing he saw the white
glitter of frost appear suddenly upon his garments even
upon the red dust the thin air he breathed seemed to
freeze his lungs he trembled his skin became a stiff
numb painful garment hindering his movements the
prince staggered on ahead of him a vague dark shadow
in the night crying out at intervals in a queer strained
voice

bill stopped looked back shivering and miserable
no use to go on he muttered no use he
stood still vainly flapping his numb arms against his
sides a vivid picture came to him-a naked staring
the prince of space



sun-bleached skull lying in the red dust bones in the
dust he muttered bones in the dust envers bones
and paulas the princes mine

  he saw something that made him stare oblivious of
the cold

  the red cliff had become a low dark line below the
star-studded sky the score of little cobalt moons were
still drifting around and around in endless circles
watching waiting they were bright among the stars

  a little green cloud came up into view above the dark
rim of the cliff a little spinning wisp of greenish vapor
a tiny sphere of swirling radiance it shone with the
clear lucent green of spring of all verdure of life itself
it spun and it shone with live green light

  with inconceivable speed it darted upward it struck
one of the blue globes a sparkling mist of dancing
emerald atoms flowed over the azure sphere dissolved
it melted it away

  bill rubbed his eyes where the sapphire ship had
been was now only a swirling mass of green mist a cloud
of twinkling emerald particles shining with a supernal
viridescent radiance that somehow suggested life

  abruptly as the first tiny wisp of green luminescence
had appeared this whirling cloud exploded it burst
into scores of tiny globes of sparkling vibrant atoms
the green cloud had eaten and grown now it was re-
producing itself like a living thing that feeds and grows
and sends off spores

  and each of the little blobs of viridity flew to an
azure sphere it seemed to bill as if the blue ships
drew them-or as if the green globules of swirling mist
were alive seeking food

  in an instant each swirling spiral of emerald mist had
struck a blue globe vibrant green haze spread over
every sphere and the spheres melted faded vanished
in clouds of swirling viridescent vapor

  it all happened very suddenly it was hardly a second
bill thought after the first of the swirling green blobs
had appeared before the last of the martian fliers had
become a mass of incandescent mist then suddenly as
they had come the green spirals vanished they were
blotted out

  the stars shone cold and brilliant in many-colored
splendor above the dark line of the cliffs the martian
ships were gone

  the vitomaton bill muttered the prince said
something about the vitomaton a new weapon using
the force of life and the green was like a living thing
consuming the spheres

  suddenly he felt the bitter cold again he moved
and his garments were stiff with frost the cold had
numbed his limbs-most of the pain had gone he felt
a curious lightness an odd sense of relief of freedom-
and a delicious alarming desire for sleep but leaden
pain of cold still lurked underneath dull throbbing

  move move he muttered through cold-stiffened
lips move keep warm

  he stumbled across the dust in the direction the prince
had taken the cold tugged at him his breath froze in
swirls of ice with all his will he fought the deadly
desire for sleep

  he had not gone far when he came upon a dark
shape in the night it was the prince carrying paula
in his arms

  i found her lying on the sand he gasped to bill
she was awake she was glad-forgave me-happy
jiow

  the prince was exhausted struggling through the
sand burdened with the girl in his arms

  why go on bill forced the words through his
freezing face never make it they shot atomic bombs
at red rover then something happened to them green
light

  the vitomaton gasped the prince vortex of
spinning disintegrated atoms controlled by wireless
power alive consumes all matter disintegrates it
into atomic nothingness

  he staggered on toward the dark line of cliffs clasp-
ing the inert form of the girl to his body

  but paula i love her i must carry her to the
ship it is my fault we must get to the ship

bill struggled along beside him too far he
muttered miles in the night in the cold well
never-

  he stopped with a thin rasping cry

  before him above the narrow black line of the cliffs
a slender bar of luminescent silver had  shot up into
view it was the slim tapering cylinder of the red
rover with her twelve rear motor rays driving white
and dazzling against the mountain she was leaving the
sunship unharmed driving upward into space

  my godl bill screamed leaving us he stag-
gered forward a pitiful trembling figure encased in
stiff frost-covered garments he waved his arms
shouted it was vain almost ludicrous

  the prince had stopped still holding paula in his
arms

  they think-martians got us he called in a queer
voice stop them fire torpedo-at boulder they
will see

  bill heard the gasping voice he unfastened the
heavy tube that he still carried on his shoulder leveled
it before him with numb trembling fingers he tried
to move the levers his fingers seemed frozen they
would not move tears burst from his eyes freezing
on his cheeks he stood holding the heavy tube in his
arms sobbing like a baby

  above them the slender white cylinder of the red
rover was driving out into star-gemmed space dazz-
ling opalescent rays shooting back at the dark mountain
behind her

  they go bill babbled they think we are dead
have not time to wait go to fight for world

  he collapsed in a trembling heap upon the loose frosty
sand

  the prince had suddenly laid paula on the ground
was beside him

  lift the rocket he gasped aim i will fire

  bill raised the heavy tube mechanically sighted
through the telescope his trembling was so violent that
he could hardly hold it upon the rock the prince tried
with his fingers to move the lever in vain then he bent
pressed his chin against it it slipped cut a red gash in
his skin again he tried and the whir of the motor re-
sponded he got his chin upon the little red button
pressed it the empty shell drove back fell from bills
numbed hands and clattered on the sand

  the torpedo struck with a burst of orange light

  the prince picked up paula again clasped her chilled
body to him bill watched the red rover suddenly he
voiced a glad incoherent cry the white rays that drove
her upward were snapped out the slim silver ship
swung about came down on a long swift glide


amazing stories

  in a moment it seemed she swept over them with a
searchlight sweeping the red sand the white beam
found the three quickly the ship dropped beside them
grotesque figures in vacuum suits leapt from the air-
lock

  in a few seconds they were abroad in warmth and
light hot moist air hissed into the lock about them
and they could breathe easily again the sizzling of the
air through the valves was the last impression of which
bill was conscious until he found himself waking up
in a comfortable bed feeling warm and very hungry
captain brand was standing with his blue eyes peering
through the door

  just looked in to see you as i was going on duty
bill he said doctor trainor says youre all right
now the prince and paula are too you were all rather
chilled but nothing was seriously frozen lucky you
shot off the rocket we had given up hope for you-
didnt dare stay

  funny change has come over the prince hes been
up a good while sitting by paulas bed hows that for
the misogynist-the hermit outlaw of space well come
on up to the bridge when youve had some breakfast the
battle with mars is going to be fought out in the next
few hours ought to be something interesting to see

  having delivered his broadside of information so fast
that the sleepy bill could hardly absorb it the bluff old
space-captain withdrew his head and went on

  an hour later bill entered the bridge-room

  gazing through the vitrolite panels he saw the fami-
liar aspect of interplanetary space-hard brilliant points
of many-colored light scintillating in a silver-dusted
void of utter blackness the flaming red-winged sun
was small and far distant earth was a huge green
star glowing with indescribably beautiful liquid emerald
brilliance the moon a silver speck beside it

  the grim red disk of mars filled a great space in the
heavens bill looked for a little blue dot that had been
visible upon the red planet for so long-the tiny azure
circle that he had first seen from the telescope in
trainors tower he found the spot where it should
be on the upper limb of the planet but it was gone

  the thing has left mars captain brand told him
it has set out on its mission of doom to earth

  what is it

  it is armored with one of their blue vibratory screens
what hellish contrivances of war it has in it and what
demoniac millions of martians no one knows it is
enormous more than a mile in diameter

  can we do anything

  i hardly see how we can do anything but we can
try trainor and the prince arc coming with their vito-
maton

  say didnt they shoot their atomic bombs at the ship
last night bill asked it was out of sight but i
imagined they had wrecked it

  one of the lookouts who was late getting back
brought down one of their globes with a rocket they
fired a lot of the purple bombs to scare us but i think
they meant to take us alive in the interest of their
science i suppose and dr trainor got the vitomaton
ready before they had done anything

  bill was peering out into the star-strewn ebon gulf
captain brand pointed he saw a tiny blue globe swim-
ming among the stars

  theres the infernal thing carrying its cargo of
horror to our earth

  in a few moments dr trainor the prince and paula
came one by one up the ladder to the bridge trainor
carried the tripod the prince brought a little black case
which contained the strange vacuum tube with the
cerium electrode and its various accessories paula had
a little calculating machine and a book of mathematical
tables

  trainor and the prince set up the tripod in the center
of the room and mounted the little black case upon it
the apparatus looked not very different from a small
camera working with cool brisk efficiency paula be-
gan operating the calculating machine taking numbers
from the book and calling out the results to the prince
who was setting numerous small dials on the apparatus

  dr trainor peered through a compact little telescope
which was evidently an auxiliary part of the apparatus
training the machine on the tiny blue disk that was the
messenger of doom from mars from time to time he
called out numbers which seemed to go into paulas
calculations

  looking curiously at paula and the prince bill could
see no sign of an understanding between them both
seemed absorbed in the problem before them they
were impersonal as any two collaborating scientists

  at last dr trainor raised his eyes from the little
telescope and the prince paused with his fingers on a
tiny switch the induction coil in the circuit of a power-
ful vitalium generator was buzzing monotonously while
purple fire leapt between its terminals paula was still
efficiently busy over the little calculating machine press-
ing its keys while the motors whirred inside it

ere all ready trainor announced as sooi
as paula finishes the integration he turned to
bill and captain brand who were eying the apparatus
with intense interest if you will look inside this elec-
tron tube when the prince closes the switch you will
see a tiny green spark come into being just at the focus
of the rays from the cerium electrode inside the vita-
lium helix grid

  that green spark is a living thing

  it has in it the vital essence it can consume matter--
feed itself it can grow it can divide reproduce itself
it responds to stimuli-it obeys the signals we send from
this directional beam transmitter he tapped an insig-
nificant little drum

  and it ceases to be when we cut off the power

  it is a living thing that eats and it is more de-
structive than anything else that eats for it destroys
the atoms that it takes into itself it resolves them into
pure vibratory energy into free protons and electrons

  paula called out another number in her soft husky
voice the prince swiftly set a last dial pressed a tiny
lever bill peering through the thin walls of a little elec-
tron tube saw a filament light saw the thin cerium disk
grow incandescent apparently under cathode bombard-
ment then he saw a tiny green spark come into being
in a fine helix of gleaming vitalium wire for a little
time it hung there swinging back and forth a little
growing slowly

  deliberately one by one the prince depressed keys
on a black panel behind the tube the little green spark
wavered suddenly it shot forward out through the wall
of the tube it swam uncertainly through the air in the
room growing until it was large as a marble the prince
flicked down another key and it darted out through a
vitrolite panel towards the blue globe from mars
the prince of space



  it had cut a little round hole in the transparent crystal
a hole the size of a mans finger the matter in it had
vanished utterly and the little viridescent cloud of
curdled light that hung outside had grown again it was
as large as a mans fist-a tiny whirling spiral of vib-
rant emerald particles

  air hissed through the little hole forming a frozen
misty cloud outside captain brand promptly produced
a little disk of soft rubber placed it against the opening
air-pressure held it tight sealing the orifice n
the prince pressed another key the little swirling
green sphere was whisked away-it vanislftd the prince
stood intent fingers on the banks of keys eyes on red
pointers that spun dizzily on tiny dials another key
clicked down suddenly he moved a dial and looked ex-
pectantly out through the vitrolite panel

  bill saw the green film run suddenly over the tiny
blue globe floating among the stars the azure sphere
seemed to melt away to dissolve into sparkling green
radiance in a moment where the great blue ship had
been was only a spinning spiral of glistening virides-
cence

  look at mars cried the prince this is a chal-
lenge if they want peace they shall have it if they
want war they shall feel the power of the vitomaton
bill turned dazedly to look at the broad disk of the
red planet it was not relatively very far away he could
see the glistening white spot that was the north polar
cap the vast ocherous deserts the dark equatorial mark-
ings the green-black lines of the canals for all the
grimness of its somber crimson color it was very bril-
liant against the darkness of the spangled void

  an amazing change came swiftly over mars

  a bluish tinge flowed over orange-red deserts a thin
blue mist seemed to have come suddenly into the atmos-
phere of the planet it darkened became abruptly solid
a wall of blue hid the red world mars became a colos-
sal globe her surface was as real as smooth and un-
broken as that of the ship they had just destroyed

  mars had become a sphere of polished sapphire

  a wall of vibration i suppose said the prince
what a science to condemn to destruction

  huge globes of purple fire-violet spheres large as
the ship they had just destroyed-driven on mighty
rays leapt out from a score of points on the smooth
azure armor that covered a world with incredible
speed they converged toward the red rover

  atomic bombs with a vengeance cried the prince
one of those would throw the earth out of its orbit
into the sun he turned briskly to paula quick now
integrations for the planet

  she sprang to the calculating machine slim fingers
flew over the keys trainor swung his apparatus to-
ward the smooth azure ball that mars had become
peered through his telescope called out a series of num-
bers to paula quickly she finished gave her results
to the prince

  he bent over the banks of keys again

  bill watched the enormous blue globe of mars in
fascinated horror followed the huge luminescent red-

purple atomic bombs that were hurtling out toward
them driven on broad white rays

  an amazing amount of power in those atomic
bombs dr trainor commented his mild eyes bright
with scientific enthusiasm i doubt that space itself is
strong enough to hold up under their explosion if they
hit us i imagine it will break down the continuum blow
us out of the universe altogether out of space and time

  bill was looking at the whirling green spiral that
hung where the martian flier had been he saw it move
suddenly dart across the star-dusted darkness of space
it plunged straight for the blue ball of mars struck it
a viridescent fog ran quickly over the enormous azure
globe

  mars melted away

  the planet dissolved in a huge madly spinning cloud
of brilliant green mist that shone with an odd light-
with a light of life a world faded into a nebulous spiral
of green mars became a spinning cloud of dust as if of
malachite

  a tiny lever flicked over under the princes fingers
and the green light went out

  where mars had been was nothing the stars
shone through hot and clear a machine no larger than
a camera had destroyed a world bill was dazed stag-
gered

  solemnly almost sadly the prince moved a slender
tanned hand across his brow a terrible thing he said
slowly it is a terrible thing to destroy a world a
world that had been eons in the making and that might
have changed the history of the cosmos    but they
voted for war we had no choice

  he shook his head suddenly and smiled its all
over the great mission of my life-completed doctor
i want you to pack the vitomaton very carefully and
lock it up in our best safe and try to forget the combina-
tion a great invention but i hope we never need to
use it again

  then the prince of space did a thing that was amazing
to most of his associates as the destruction of mars had
been he walked quickly to paula trainor and put his
arms around her he slowly tilted up her elfin face
where the golden eyes were laughing now with a great
tender light of gladness shining in them he bent and
kissed her warm red lips with a hungry eagerness that
was almost boyish

  a happy smile was dancing in his eyes when he looked
up at the astounded captain brand and the others

  allow me he said to present the princess of
space

  some months later when bill was landed on trainors
tower on a visit from his new home in the city
of space he found that the destruction of mars had
created an enormous sensation astronomers were man-
fully inventing fantastic hypotheses to explain why the
red planet had first turned blue then green and finally
vanished utterly the sunships of the moon patrol were
still hunting merrily for the prince of space since the
loss of the tritons treasure the reward for his capture
had been increased to twenty-five million eagles

  und er the sea

by harl vincent

 author of bartons island callisto at war etc

      terhaps it is because radium is such a rare metal that so many of its bene-
      jl ficial aspects are developed but it has already been discovered in several
      instances how harmful this marvelous healing product can be imagine that
      instead of the people of the legendary city of atlantis with their progressive
      benevolence an entirely different sort of beings had landed on a rich bed of
      radium ore with its possibilities for evil rather than for good harl vincent can
      generally be counted on for the unusual

           he amply justifies the faith of his readers with this yarn

fter having diverged more than seven hundred
miles off her course to avoid a storm the sea-
plane challenger was nearing her goal if
pete caldwells reckoning was correct and if
their gasoline held out they should come
down in auckland harbor by sundown

  at best it was a long tough flight from valparaiso to
the new zealand city this one had been brutal-
treacherous flying weather most of the way-and both
occupants of the planes cabin were tense and irritable
under the strain their radio had gone dead and the
inductor compass acted erratically

  hey pete ben walton shouted from the rear com-
partment where the emergency gas tanks were located
i make it just fifty gallons well never get there
youre crazy yelled the pilot eyes straight ahead
its less than three hundred miles

  yeah-maybe-if that bum compass isnt fooling
you

  oh shut up i know what im doing whats the
matter with you-scared

  ordinarily this would have resulted in a prolonged
argument for pete and ben were that sort of friends
but the stocky young mechanic had come forward and
was standing at petes side gazing intently toward the
dark waters some five hundred feet beneath them

  pete he exclaimed pointing a stubby forefinger
take a squint out there what in the devil do you
suppose that is

  the pilot turned his head with a shrug of his broad
shoulders he wasnt particularly interested in any-
thing they might see in this god-forsaken part of the
pacific but he gasped when he saw the object ben had
pointed out

  looks like a big silver tank sticking up out of the
water he said a young oil tank painted with alu-
minum so help me

  he banked sharply and swung the ship over for a
closer view they circled the object and dropped to two
hundred feet it was some sort of a cylindrical vessel
standing vertically to a height of perhaps thirty feet
from the placid waters and apparently fixed firmly as if
it rose from the bottom

  now what do you know about that ben mar-
veled who do you suppose built such a thing way
out here

  as if in answer to his question a circular lid opened
in the flat top of the cylinder and a mans head was
poked through the roar of their motor attracted his
attention and he looked skyward as amazed as they

  then it happened a gleaming weapon in the hands of
the stranger a stabbing pencil of purplish light and the
big radial motor in the nose of their ship quit cold
the challenger dropped to the surface in an easy glide

  hells bells pete growled now whatre we up
against 

  trouble ben grunted sure as shooting take
a look at the face on that baby

  does look like a tough one ben-no fooling here-
grab a gun for yourself pete had taken two auto-
matics from the locker as he spoke

  others had joined the man on the tank now squat
deformed creatures all of them the plane was drifting
closer carried in toward the metal cylinder by freakish
currents that seemed to eddy in to its polished sides from
all directions the flat features and baleful glares of the
misshapen humans could now be seen plainly humans 
no they were hairless apes rather clad only in breech


he banked sharply and swung the ship

amazing stories

cloths and with pasty white skin like corpses-altogether
repulsive

  pete opened the trapdoor in the cabin roof and both
climbed through to the open air whats the big idea 
he called out over the narrowing strip of water whatd
you bring us down for

  he who seemed to be the leader of the ape-men yelled
something in unintelligible gutturals and then turned to
converse with his companions replicas of the mys-
terious ray weapon which had been used to bring them
down appeared in the hands of each of the dwarfs

  theyre too many for us ben whispered whatll
we do

  wait and see what they do well shoot it out with
them if we have to but whats the use of getting our-
selves croaked if we can talk ourselves out of it
whos going to talk that jabber of theirs

  maybe there is somebody down below in that thing
we can talk to besides im getting curious about it
like to see the inside of the thing

  not me id like to be home-right now

  more of the ape-men had come up through the hatch
and there were at least a dozen of them now on the flat
top of the cylinder the plane was almost alongside
when a dense cloud of blue vapor spurted forth to meet
them they were completely enveloped in the vile smell-
ing stuff blinded and coughing clammy hands pawed
at them in the darkness fingers of steel gripped them
strong arms cold and unyielding as metal bands pin-
ioned them hand and foot though they fought des-
perately to save themselves neither dared fire his pistol
for fear of hitting the other they were helpless in the
hands of a mysterious enemy

ete caldwell mused gloomily in the steel-
walled cell into which he had been thrown he was
something of an engineer and had served in the under-
sea forces of the united states in the war of  so
the throbbing of the pumps and the rush of water into
the ballast tanks told him this was some sort of a sub-
marine into which they had been hauled a monster
too funny after the war he had sworn he never
again would enter one of the damned things-went in
for aviation instead and finally wound up as a pilot in
the chile-new zealand mail service swell mess they
were in now-ben and he who these long-armed
dwarfs were and what they were up to he couldnt
even guess frisked him of his gun too the apes

  the sub had grounded now and a key rattled in the
lock of his cell door a number of the dwarfs appeared
and tiey indicated that he was to follow them there
was nothing to do but to comply

  they followed a long passageway and were joined
by others who had ben in tow but the ugly menacing
creatures kept the two men apart as if in fear of a con-
certed effort against them numbers of the ray weapons
were in evidence

  then a door opened and they were prodded into the
confines of an airlock with the familiar circular hatches
at each end the devils intended to drown them like
rats in a trap but no-their captors remained with
them one of them was working with the clamps of the
outer cover could these weird creatures live under
water 

  they stepped out on solid ground and into a warm and
fetid atmosphere the sub had slipped through a huge
airlock into a vast artificially lighted submarine cavern

  christopher ben yelled look at em pete hun-
dreds of the pig boats-or tractors or whatever they
are

  it was true the great arched cavern was literally
crowded with the sub-surface ships pete rubbed his
eyes in disbelief of what they told him these subs were
tanks submarine tanks of shining metal that resem-
bled silver stainless steel or chromium plated prob-
ably to better resist corrosion each cigar-shaped body
was mounted on huge caterpillar tracks that would en-
able them to travel on land as well as on the ocean bot-
tom and there were rudders and fins the same as
any submarine-twin screws astern the cylinder
through which they had entered the one that had brought
them was a huge conning tower on all of them there
were torpedo tubes fore and aft big gun turrets on the
superstructure what terrible engines of destruction

  lord pete gasped something goes on here-
something rotten in the state of denmark all right and
this isnt denmark by a long way

  they were being hustled along an elevated runway
of iron grating now their captors prodding them with
the ray weapons the cage of a lift awaited them at
the end of the runway

for an interminable time it seemed they dropped
into the bowels of the earth then they were in a
brightly lighted room where it was ominously quiet and
where a square jawed stern visaged man sat before a
broad glass topped desk he looked up when they en-
tered and his short cropped grizzled gray hair brought
an exclamation of recognition from pete

  andre shevan he exclaimed chevan-discredited
commander-in-chief of the red forces in the last war
exiled by the peace commission it was impossible

  yes the great chevan in person surprised the
supposed exile grinned evilly he dismissed his mal-
formed minions with a nod

  naturally pete snarled what devilment are you
up to now  and why did your gang of imps kidnap
us this way

  explaining the devilment can wait young man as
to the kidnaping it was quite necessary i assure you
you saw one of our war vessels and of a certainty i
could not let you report it to the world were not yet
ready to show our hand besides i can well use two
such accomplished and healthy americans

  you mean youll hold us here-against our will
pete was incredulous

  of a certainty not only that i shall use you when
the time comes to set forth against the americas both
of you are war veterans and your experience will be of
value to me ah war it is the spice of life is it
not

  war  ben echoed petes exclamation

  exactly and such a war as you shall see and par-
ticipate in

  not on your life pete snapped

  no you have no alternative my friend and you
should not object-it is a great honor i am extending
and the pleasure it gives to me that you are americans
you shall fight your own people

youre crazy as a coot pete was contemptuous
am i listen boys ive been working with the
akata-imps you have called them and apes-for more
than ten years while the world at large has thought me
banished and safely out of the way on a barren and
tanks under the sea



deserted island but-ha ha-a substitute languishes
in my stead on that so remote island while i andre
chevan am here the akata number more than seven
millions no dont laugh they are decended from an
intelligent people who migrated to this vast realm under
the pacific more than thirty centuries in the past a
thousand years before the time of your christ they knew
the secret of the transmutation of metals of the sub-
marine of the death ray and of atomic disintegration-
when the rest of the world was in abysmal ignorance of
science for centuries theyve planned a war against
the outside world and were well on the way to complete
preparation before i came to organize them and lead
them now the time is at hand and i andre chevan
am to have my vengeance upon the world that cast me
off

  his heavy features became saturnine with the fanati-
cism that lighted them pete and ben stared at him
agape the man was insane

  now we know youre a nut pete grated our
forts and battle planesll blow these tanks of yours to
kingdom-come before youve well started

  yes let me tell you something every sub-tank of
the more than six hundred is armed with paralyzing
rays that will cause your big guns to miss fire and your
planes to fall from the air have you forgotten how the
challenger was brought down  the tanks will crawl up
from the depths of the ocean and overrun the americas
at the speed of fifty miles an hour blasting your cities
to ashes with death rays and high explosives your for-
ests with flame projectors after america the world
the akata will ravage and plunder and kill theyll
take possession and i shall be king

  ho a modern napoleon pete sneered

  chevan glared an instant then chuckled well put
young man your grasp of the idea is perfect and
now i have a proposition to make to you and your
friend the akata are of marvelous intelligence and
skill they are fearless and loyal but you have seen
them-i hardly fancy them as intimates rather would
i have two such as yourselves for my trusted lieutenants
join me in this campaign and the world is yours youll
share with me in the glory and honor and wealth that
are to be mine-the power-think of it it is a chance
in a million

  suppose we refuse ben inquired softly

   pete poked his ribs surreptitiously to silence him

  chevan was drawing a finger across his own throat
meaningly a malicious leer making an awful mask of
his countenance one of my akata guards is expert
with the knife he said and eager to use it at my
command

  give us a week to think it over pete said suddenly
bestowing an imperceptible wink on his wrath-filled
friend

  chevan regarded first one and then the other of his
captives with keen suspicion but could discern naught
save awed solemnity in their faces

  ill do it he agreed seven days of twenty-four
hours i believe by that time youll willingly come in
ithe folly of doing otherwise will be only too apparent
to you-after you have seen

  meanwhile asked pete

  you are free to come and go to check up on my
statements youll be quartered and fed-and watched
closely

  he rang for his servants

chevan was as good as his word the two amer-
icans were assigned to luxurious rooms and were
served with meals at the commanders own table they
were taken in charge by one of the akata a putty-faced
creature with feline eyes who answered to the name of
ongli and was inordinately proud of his ability to con-
verse with them in choppy sentences of broken english
in a surly way he was solicitous of their every want
accompanying them wherever they wished to go and ex-
plaining in detail the many wonders of aka which
aroused their curiosity they went everywhere and
saw everything but always they were trailed by a num-
ber of the sullen akata guards-uncanny creatures
whose staring eyes followed their every move and whose
ominous mutterings provided a monotonous accompani-
ment to their every conversation

  ongli it seemed was a leader of his kind and of
vastly superior class and influence his word was law
to the guards and amongst the rabble on the moving
ways in the pneumatic tubes or in workshop or foun-
dry his badge of authority gained them admission
wherever they wished to go the science of the akata
was at his finger-tips and he proudly exhibited his
knowledge of its most complex secrets

  and ongli was destined to be a great chief when the
new order of things was established in the surface world
chevan had told him so himself and was not chevan
a god-mightiest of all earthlings beneath the surface
or above

  ben was inclined to be argumentative and openly de-
fiant what sense was there is shamming this way
theyd never join up with this crazy scheme so why
not kick over the traces at once and have it over with
chevan would have their life blood in the end

  shut up you dumb-bell pete hissed when they
were on their way to one of the chemical laboratories of
which ongli had told them trust me now to dope
something out and you keep your trap shut well
have no conversations at all until the times up this
guy chevans clever hell get wise in a minute unless
we pretend-

  whats that you say ongli asked suspiciously and
the guards moved in closer at the sound of his voice

  he doesnt want to go said pete feigning impa-
tience with his partner wants to go in one of your
sub-tanks instead

  that can wait two three sleeps ongli averred his
suspicion allayed this more important it basic
you see

  the guards fell back and pete glared at his friend
warningly theyd have to be mighty careful

  they had stepped forth on a ledge that skirted the
wall of an enormous cavern a great arched hollow be-
neath the bed of the pacific a cavern such as the eye
of man had never beheld brilliantly illuminated by
the cold blue light the akata produced so abundantly it
stretched off into the distance where the haze of its
humid atmosphere rendered all things invisible a city
lay beneath their feet a city of tall buildings and broad
streets that hummed with activity

  ongli waved his arm with an all-inclusive gesture
oniri he exclaimed first city of aka first of
main cavern first of seven hundred cities queen city
of aka

  what pete gasped you mean to tell me there
are seven hundred cities like this down here how
big is aka anyway


amazing stories

  i speak true ongli drew himself to his full height
impressively nine caverns there are seven hundred
cities main cavern a thousand-what you call it-miles
long yes it true and other caverns below others
to north one south aka a big place

  ill say it is pete caldwell was aghast at the
revelation somehow he had thought that chevan was
exaggerating when he spoke of the numbers of the
akata this was a continent in itself a continent under
the sea

  ben was grouchily silent

  ongli led them to a niche in the rock wall here
there was a platform that stretched along the side of a
smooth metal groove the lower half of a cylinder which
ended at circular covers set into the walls at either ex-
tremity

  station of air pressure tube ongli explained we
go twenty miles to laboratory

  there came a rapidly rising hiss a screech almost
and one of the circular doors popped open to disgorge a
bullet-shaped car that came to a stop in the groove beside
them in a moment they were within and the door had
clanged shut there was a roar and the pressure of
swi ft acceleration as the car was shot into that smooth
walled tube that led into the unknown distances of that
strange submarine realm pete looked around the in-
terior curiously there were no passengers excepting
their own party ben was staring at the wall stub-
bornly refusing to exhibit his amazement ongli and
the akata guards had sprawled carelessly on the cush-
ioned seats and were regarding their charges with ex-
pressionless fishy eyes

  in less than five minutes the car slowed down and
came to a lurching stop the door clicked open and
they stepped out into a duplicate of the station at which
they had embarked ongli led the way through a nar-
row passage to the laboratory

  above them there rose a huge crystal dome which was
all that separated them from the tremendous weight of
water above the light of the sun shone through with
an eerie blue-green radiance which illuminated the
cavern with a sort of sepulchral twilight in the half
light they could make out dim monstrous shapes huge
cylinders and spheres that throbbed with energy from
within here and there a light glowed over a control
board and in the circle of each they could make out
the stunted figures of akata workmen engaged in the
mysterious tasks occasioned by the operation of the
giant machines at the far end of the long main aisle
there arose a shower of brilliant sparks as a stream of
molten metal burst forth from a ladle and found its way
into a waiting mold huge cranes-dim ghostly mon-
sters high overhead-rumbled ponderously over their
tracks and were lost in the gloom

  here it was and in hundreds of similar laboratories
that the essentials of life were produced by the akata
the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the repulsive in-
habitants as revealed by ongli were marvelous to con-
template-and fearsome self-contained and self-sup-
porting was the realm of aka and it seemed that the
intelligent gnomes that peopled it needed nothing more
than the brine of the ocean to make any and all of their
necessities from this they extracted the component ele-
ments the separated hydrogen being used as the base
of practically every commodity they merely broke up
the simple atoms of this element into protons and elec-
trons and then reassembled these to produce any of the

other elements they required the need for the crystal
dome was accounted for by the fact that a certain catalyst
used in the processes was subject to rapid deteriora-
tion either in complete darkness or in the normal arti-
ficial lighting of the caverns but was not affected by
the weak filtered sunlight from above

  ongli halted them before a railed-in enclosure where
a number of workmen were engaged in attaching a lift-
ing rig to the huge eyes of a circular cover plate which
rested on the rim of a sunken cauldron of enormous
size above them dangled the chain block of one of the
cranes

  radium pit their guide explained must not come
nearer as it very dangerous to life

  pete noticed that the workmen were protected by
leaden aprons and gauntlets and that they wore helmets
of the same material the guards drew well back when
the hooks were attached and the signal given for the
crane operator to hoist the cover ben feigned an air
of nonchalant boredom

  the great cast lead lid swung free and a blast of
greenish incandescence smote them like the breath of a
furnace the air about them vibrated to the energy of
the vicious boiling contents of the cauldron swirling
fingers of the greenish substance stretched forth and
squirmed menacingly then dropped writhing into the
mass of seething material

  gaze not too long ongli warned there is blind-
ness in so doing all of the power we use is thus born
the radium it is so very-

  but pete had glanced upward as a startled cry rang
out in the eerie purple twilight above one of the chains
supporting the great metal lid had snapped and the heavy
casting teetered precariously on the two remaining sup-
ports it was directly over their heads swaying jerkily
there was another snap and it swung down with a
swish pete grasped ongli and threw him to the floor
with jarring violence just as the swinging mass of metal
crashed through the iron railing and carried two of the
workmen into the mouth of the radium pit he lay
panting beside the prone figure of ongli noting with
satisfaction that ben had jumped sideways and had
saved himself by his action

  frightful animal cries from the doomed workmen
rose piercingly above the din of the laboratory and they
disappeared beneath the bubbling surface of the greenish
liquid a momentary wild thrashing of arms brought a
horribly distorted akata face to the surface where the
staring eyes had been there were awful smouldering
sockets the flat features were a metallic mask grinning
sardonically through the green phosphorescence then
it was gone and dancing waves of the glowing liquid
lapped triumphantly at the edges of the pit

  pandemonium broke loose in the great laboratory
the workmen deserting their posts and crowding to the
scene of the accident a-siren shrieked with raucous in-
sistence a din of babbling voices drowned out the
sounds of the machines

  ai ai wailed ongli as pete lifted him to his feet
and dragged him from the howling mob the radium
death but ongli lives by quick act of american ongli
never forget ongli repay

  he fawned on his rescuer trembling with emotion
then he drew himself erect and glared at the guards
who had gathered close

  ben grinned delightedly this was a break the
monkey-man would be a friend in need
tanks under the sea



chevan sent for them before the sleeping period
ongli had reported the accident and was engaged
in animated conversation with his chief when they ap-
proached the glass-topped desk

  caldwell said chevan your quick action in sav-
ing ongli from the radium death convinces me anew that
you are the very man i want for the great work to
come but i am compelled to warn you that his grati-
tude can avail you nothing in any attempt to evade
the agreement with me you can not escape from
aka four hundred and sixty feet of water roll over
your heads and there is but one exit from aka-through
the airlock in the cavern of the sub-tanks ongli is a
new-made friend but his first loyalty is to the great
cause then too there are other watchers understand
pete understood perfectly four hundred and sixty
feet of water that meant a pressure of some two
hundred pounds to the square inch on the doors of the
airlock and on the crystal domes of the laboratories
what tremendous strength must be built into these
things and into the sub-tanks themselves

  we understand chevan he said shortly but in
accordance with your promise we still have six days
in which to decide

  true it is merely a warning im giving you you
shall have your six days if you wish but pm confident
youll decide before the time is up-and decide right
pete and ben were mute

  you do not answer chevan regarded them thought-
fully he had had much experience with the stubborn-
ness of americans very well ill not press you but
each twenty-four hours will bring new revelations to
you each will further convince you of the wisdom of
a decision to join us i dont know why im giving you
this chance but somehow it seems i need human com-
panionship and assistance   

  he hesitated and looked apologetically at ongli the
great chevan was not altogether happy in his adopted
environment

  perhaps pete ventured you are on the wrong
track chevan maybe youll give up this mad venture
wed gladly help you in that

  what the commander thundered go back to a
world that turned its back to me back to exile
never its a rotten world anyway and merits annihila-
tion i shall establish a new order of things a new
civilization from the destruction shall rise better
things with the aid of akata science i shall breed
a race of supermen and superwomen moulded in the
form of the nordic but of god-like beauty and stature
and with superhuman intelligence and i chevan shall
rule them-wisely and well you think my venture
is a mad one you think the conquest impossible here-
look at this

  he strode to a wall cabinet and switched on the cur-
rent of a television receiver as the screen glowed into
life ongli excused himself and left the room

  another step in your education he announced
manipulating the dials of the instrument rapidly this
teleview surpasses anything in use on the surface no
transmitter is necessary to actuate it a searching ray
is sent out to the point to be viewed and the light im-
pulses are brought back to us for observation in natural
color the same ray conveys to us the sounds emanating
from the point of origin of the view a great contri-
vance for your secret service-if they had it

  the view of the screen was that of an enormous room

where hundreds of vertical cylinders lined the walls
from which cylinders a maze of piping led through
numerous other vessels and finally converged at the
mouth of a great circular pit in the center of the room
a pulsating blue-green glow permeated the atmosphere
of the room and all the workmen in sight were encased
in protective armor the buzz of activity came to their
ears like that of a swarm of bees

  radium breathed chevan ah how little you know
of its uses and properties-you of the surface world
your scientists tell you that it is an element whose
atomic weight is  and whose atomic number is 
they know of its continuous disintegration of the emis-
sion of alpha and beta particles of the gamma radia-
tions its products have been investigated by them and
are in partially successful use in therapy the gas radon
particularly but in all their research and experiments
they have never learned the true secret of radioactivity
they have never been able to speed up the normal rate
of disintegration of the radium atom as have the akata
the vast energy available from this source is thus lost
to the peoples of the surface world even did they
know these things it would avail them little since the
mineral is extremely rare up there as you know here
there is an unlimited supply

  pete was listening with interest as he watched the
screen but ben affected his usual air of indifference and
walked around the room looking at everything excep-
ting the screen

  radium exists in many forms pete asked

  oh yes-down through the uranium-radium-lead dis-
integration series there are many stages radium itself
is produced by the disintegration of its parent ionium
and disappears on disintegrating into its product radon
in turn then down through the series we have radium
a b c and three other forms down to polonium-then
lead the end product then of course there are the
compounds sulphates hydroxides chlorides bromides
and the like it was a liquid compound you saw in the
laboratory but the important thing is that the akata
understand the stuff perfectly their very existence de-
pends on it as does the success of the war against the
upper world the vast energy of the alpha particles is
used to run their prime movers tiny vibrationless
radium motors provide all their power beta radiations
are used to set up disintegration of other elements and
in conjunction with the penetrating gamma radiations
to activate the various destructive rays to be used in
warfare here-another instructive view

  the scene changed with a new adjustment of the dials
a hollow roar came from the sound projector of the
apparatus they were deep in a rock-walled passage
now with a group of akata workmen who were opera-
ting the complicated mechanism with a huge ray projec-
tor the roaring sound increased in volume as the
blinding shaft of light from the projector contacted with
a ledge of solid limestone fully thirty feet in depth and
extending for a hundred yards along the wall of the
passage like a knife through cheese the disintegrating
energy of the beam cut through the mass of rock slicing
it neatly from the wall until by its own tremendous
weight it broke away the last remaining connection and
thundered to the floor with a crash that rattled the sound
mechanism and caused the view to flutter violently on
the screen

  wow ben exclaimed some ray that he had
been startled from his pose by the wonder of the sight


amazing stories

  yes chevan gloated each sub-tank is armed with
eight such projectors in addition to others equally de-
structive in different ways how long do you think
your paralyzed forts and battle planes will stand up
under such energies your skyscrapers but watch

  the huge mass of stone was blocking the passage
thousands of tons of it the workmen directed the ray
into the mass adjusting it to a broadened flare that
covered considerable portion of the enormous block
the roar swelled to an ear-shattering rumble and the
rock melted away as if it had been paraffin excepting
there was no residue it simply vanished from sight and
in less time than is taken in the telling all was clear

  you see chevan said triumphantly the power
that is in our hands is beyond comprehension and this
is but the beginning of what you will be shown he
switched off the power and the screen of the teleview
went blank

  pete gazed at their captor with growing realization
of the enormity of the menace to his world chevan
he muttered im beginning to believe some of the
things of which you have boasted but i still think
youre barking up the wrong tree suppose you do
succeed in this terrible thing suppose you overrun the
americas and bring them under your heels suppose
even that you conquer the entire world what about
these seven million akata who will be let loose on the
surface theyll defeat your plan to set up a new re-
gime they not you will be in control theyll populate
the surface with their own breed and continue to kill
off our present civilization they may even kill you-
after theyve used you to lead them to victory

  chevan smiled craftily and lowered his voice all
thought of my boy he cackled the entire brood will
die off within a week after the victory is complete ill
take care of that

  what you think you have a way of killing them
off

  i know i have listen-and this may help you in
reaching you decision-i have no intention of letting the
akata benefit from the conquest they do not fit into
my new scheme of things at all theyre too loathsome
physically though possessed of marvelous intellect and
scientific attainment not for andre chevan and here
is the means of eliminating them radium again is the
secret the radium they must have for their continued
existence and which i shall cut off from them the
food they eat contains minute quantities of the element
which to us would be fatal but which to them is vital
theyve lived in such close contact with the stuff that
the tiny doses are necessary as a prophylactic theyd
have cted off centuries ago had they not inured their
systems to its ravages in this manner and heres the
joker-they must carry a supply of the stuff with them
for internal use a special compound that is extremely
unstable and can be deteriorated instantly by subjec-
tion to radio waves of a definite frequency high above
any in use for practical purposes but i chevan have
secretly developed a powerful transmitter of this short
wave and when the time comes i will release its energy
broadcast their preservative will vanish like magic
and they will die before they can renew the supply
their ugly bodies disintegrating like that limestone block
within the space of twenty-four hours now-is chevan
vise 

  he gazed into their horror-stricken faces with mali-
cious glee they were in the hands of a fiend incarnate

ongli awaited them when they left their quarters
early in the next waking period the sullen guards
hovered expectantly in the passage outside their door

  now we visit sub-tank ongli announced brightly

  good said pete without enthusiasm his thoughts
were gloomy now it was a strain this fear of speaking
ones thoughts aloud he and ben had refrained from
conversation since leaving chevan before the sleeping
period-the searching ray of his telephone view and
sound mechanism would find them out the walls sure
did have ears in this place-eyes too

  ben was in a vile humor and lagged behind as pete
followed ongli to the tube station

  ongli too was less talkative than he had been though
his every action bespoke consideration of the man who
had saved his life-and respectful gratitude

  when they were in the speedy car of the pneumatic
tube pete turned suddenly to the guide ongli he
asked about this war against the upper world can
nothing stop it even if something should happen to
chevan the commander would have a job listening-
in on this conversation hed be kept mighty busy follow-
ing a car speeding at five hundred miles an hour

  ongli eyed him in surprise nothing stop war he
averred nothing happen to chevan but even if did
happen war go on akata make religion of hatred
against your world religion of hatred upper world
religion of love radium no good friend war is neces-
sary must not fail that why you must join with ongli
save ongli from radium death now ongli save you
good friend but only can save if you agree to join
akata cannot return you to upper world even if
could that not help good friend die then-when akata
come

  the eyes of the ape-man had at first glittered with
the fanaticism of a bitter enemy-that religious hatred
of the world now they were wide with anxiety lest
his new friend seal his own death warrant by refusing
chevans offer

  pete smiled with an attempt to reassure him then
lapsed into gloomy silence once more there was no
help to be gotten from this source chevan or no
chevan the plans would be carried out he wondered
why they ever had taken the exile in with them-and
how they had accomplished this

  they left the car at the cavern of the sub-tanks and
followed ongli down the long runway to one of the
monster amphibians that waited at the inner door of the
huge airlock the guards left them at the entrance
to the vessel

  chevan say you learn much said ongli as he bolted
the cover of the entrance lock from the inside ongli
show you-yes very much this war machine to be
onglis own command when time comes

  he proudly led the way to the control room of the
vessel

  the few akata they encountered in the passages
bowed low in recognition of onglis authority but not
without bestowing glares of hatred on the two americans
who accompanied him it was evident they would be
given short shrift were the protection of chevan and his
aides withdrawn

  how much akata will one of these ships carry
pete inquired

  three thousand onglis eyes lighted with pleasure
when he sat at the controls of the huge vessel three
thousand fighting men of aka but so simple the control
tanks under the sea



one man can handle from here you shall see ongli
maneuver ship with own hands

  before them were the intricate controls of the sub-
tank a maze of glittering instruments and handwheels
that covered the forward wall of the control room a
circular window of heavy glass looked out over the
curving hull plates toward the pointed bow and through
this they could see that the inner cover of the giant air-
lock which opened to the pacific was being opened

  ongli caressed a gleaming lever at his touch there
came the smooth purr of the radium motors from some-
where in the vitals of the huge amphibian at his touch
of another lever they moved forward on the cater-
pillar tracks they were in the airlock now and ongli
talked as they waited for the inner door to close

  sub-tanks to go out thus when time comes he said
nearly two million akata go with them provisions
ammunition everything for campaign go too tunnels
from aka to america nearly ready now through
tunnels other five million akata enter surface world
after sub-tanks clear way bore through with disinte-
grating energy when time comes then all in sunlight
where belong where surface men mistreat them cen-
turies ago this war of revenge good friend
revenge echoed pete and ben

  yes akata ancestors great scientists three thousand
years ago savages of upper world think science witch-
craft persecute our forebears without mercy finally
few survivors escape to aka which then island in great
sea find rich mineral deposits radium ore in vast
amount beneath surface of island akata become miners
and live mostly in underground passages then come
great earthquake and tidal wave aka sink far beneath
waves and akata entombed but not discouraged de-
velop science very much and prosper greatly multiply
for many generations and prepare war against surface
people now ready for war ready to retake world
where once mistreated

  what  ben snarled youve nurtured a grudge for
thirty centuries  against descendants of savages of the
dark ages why our modern civilization is absolutely
innocent of any of those old wrongs how do you get
that way

  ongli drew himself up proudly and fire flashed from
his beady eyes akata never forget he announced
and you speak not truth your people same as ever
not innocent bad spiteful warring races still on sur-
face many many wars up there since aka sink we
watch in teleview we see horrible destruction of last
war we find chevan he great general great organ-
izer he know much about strength and weakness of
all nations up there he hate them too because they
misuse him as akata ancestors misused we send sub-
tank for him and rescue he lead us to victory we
make upper world clean and good once more

  why you nut ben retorted chevan is a double

crosser if there ever was one he plans to-

  but pete had clapped his hand over his partners
mouth you fool he hissed shut up the big
boys probably listening to every word want to get
bumped off right now

  i dont give a damn were done for anyway cant
you see how hopeless it is theyre all set-they can
do just what they say they will well either be croaked
here or back home so what difference does it make
ongli watched and listened in amazement he did
not understand why the two should be quarreling the

ways of the white men of the surface were incompre-
hensible then suddenly he turned to his instrument
board the airlock was filled with water outside them
and the outer door was opening

  ugh he grunted forget talk we go out now

  the beams of two powerful searchlights illuminated
the waters far ahead of them and the two young ame-
ricans lost themselves in contemplation of the wonders
of the oceans depths the sub-tank crawled rapidly
over the smooth bottom and pete watched carefully the
movements of onglis deft fingers as he maneuvered
the vessel a forest of calcareous algae loomed before
them and they crashed through it as some prehistoric
mastodon might crash through a forest of saplings a
giant deep sea creature with armored sides and staring
eyes that waved at the ends of long tentacles slithered
over the forward deck and was gone

  we go to surface ongli stated

  the throbbing of pumps mingled with the purr of the
main motors with these exhaustless radium engines
there was no need of using compressed air to blow the
ballast tanks as in the big boats with which pete was
familiar the sub rose leisurely from the bottom

  we not open conning tower ongli observed che-
van say not but can see from here also show you
speed of ship

  the twin screws were churning the water now and the
sub shot forward at ten fathoms depth fifty sixty
seventy miles an hour if the speed indicator was correct
pete gasped his astonishment

  can do ninety on surface ongli chortled noting
his surprise these ships fast on land or sea watch

  they broke the surface and scudded along behind a
roaring bow wave it was good to see the sun shining
once more and the blue of the sky

  ben uttered a startled exclamation from his position
at one of the starboard ports look pete a british
cruiser

  ongli whipped his head around sharply it was true
there not two thousand yards astern was the long
gray shape black smoke pouring from her funnels and
her ensign fluttering in the breeze a puff of smoke
issued from one of her forward gun turrets as they
watched and the sub was rocked by the force of a ter-
rific explosion a column of water rose high where the
shell struck the water off their bow the cruiser was
inquisitive as to the identity of this strange craft

  pete watched ongli narrowly wondering whether he
would submerge surely he could not submit to a closer
inspection by this war vessel of the surface world
onglis eyes flashed fire as a second shot came across
their bow and suddenly he was snarling into the micro-
phone that hung before him rapid replies came to
their ears in the gutturals of aka then came that
stabbing pencil of purple light from the stern turret
splashing full against the hull of the cruiser

  the sub had swung around now and ongli was snap-
ping orders into the microphone they could see the
gun crew on the cruiser frantically working with the
useless mechanism of a rapid-fire gun the proud war
vessel was rolling helplessly her turbine-electric drive
paralyzed by the vicious ray of the akata

  you dont intend- pete hesitated

  i do intend ongli babbled fiercely surface ship
attack sub they go now first of great war

  he shouted a quick command and the sub vibrated to
the energy of a powerful ray generator there was a


amazing stories

deafening roar as the shaft of blinding light sped from
the sub on its mission of destruction the cruiser was
shrouded in a brilliant mist for a moment then it was
gone vanished utterly from the surface of the ocean a
seething cauldron of tortured waters marking the spot
where it had rested a marvelous war machine of the
greatest navy on earth a thousand brave men vibrant
with life an instant before-gone gone in the twinkling
of an eye

  pete caldwell was assailed with nausea as ongli gazed
exultantly on the scene of destruction

ater when they reported to chevan the captives
from the surface world were gloomy and taciturn
the commander regarded them with triumphant glee
as ongli recited the tale of his encounter with and de-
struction of the cruiser

  saw something this time didnt you he chuckled
begin to believe well succeed dont you

  yes curse you ben growled and its murder
thats what it is that cruiser didnt attack she only

fired across our bows why-

  enough chevan roared it is but the beginning
all war is murder and ill have no criticism from such
as you another word and ill retract my agreement
pete was nudging his friend into silence they still
had five days to go and he was trying to think there
must be some way in which they could outwit this mad
exile-some way to forestall the plans of the loathsome
akata

   it seems he said in a placating tone that you have
us in your power chevan i am almost convinced of the
final success of the war that is planned ben isnt-
quite but hell come around im sure before the time
is up

  ben glared at him in disgust and opened his mouth
as if to object then shutting it with a click of his teeth
as he saw that fleeting look of guile he had often seen
in his friends face when he was about to hatch one of
his plots

  yes im sure of it chevan settled back in his seat
with a satisfied smile it is just a matter of educa-
tion and a little patience with you two until you see
the light im willing to wait until your period of grace
has expired itll be worth it

  ongli gave us some of the history of aka today
said pete as if nothing else mattered and told us
much regarding the plans for conquering the upper
world its quite a revelation

  hm-yes he turned to ongli suddenly you can
leave us now he said until after the next sleep re-
port to miti-oro and tell him i have commended you
for your action in destroying the enemy ship

  ongli bowed low and withdrew pete thought he saw
an expression of suspicion pass over his distorted fea-
tures but you couldnt be sure about any facial ex-
pression of these creatures-excepting the hatred that
flashed from their beady eyes ongli was the only one of
those they had seen who did not register undying enmity
when his eyes rested on them funny they tolerated
chevan

  no sooner had ongli retired from the room when
chevan lowered his voice confidentially and leered at his
two unwilling guests that one he said is the most
humanlike of all his kind he seems to have understand-
ing and emotions that his fellows have long since for-
gotten but even so i do not relish the thought of him

as an intimate god but theyre repulsive i cant wait
for the time to press the release of the energy that will
spell the doom of the entire breed miti-oro their king
trusts me ongli trusts me but little do they suspect that
i have discovered the secret of the frequency that will
destroy their supply of the radioactive prophylactic on
which their existence depends little do they think that
i chevan am to be their nemesis as they are to be
the nemesis of the upper world

  he pointed a finger to a metal-studded door in a cor-
ner of the room behind that door he gloated there
is the portable transmitter of the frequency that does
the trick when the great work is accomplished and when
all of the breed of aka have migrated to the surface i
shall actuate that transmitter then chevan alone will
hold the fate of the earth in his hands the new era will
have begun and you peter caldwell shall share in the

spoils you too benjamin walton if-

  from the front door came the cold voice of ongli
bitingly sarcastic there be no if andre chevan
ongli has heard now miti-oro hear and chevan live
not to see the day traitor

  chevan had risen from his chair his face purpling
quick as a flash his hand shot over the desk top and in
it was gripped a slender weapon at sight of which ongli
turned suddenly to flee but too late the spiteful crack
of the ray pistol coincided with his movement and a
sudden flash of light burst forth between his broad
shoulders a splash of flame it seemed to be searing
flame that spreadand devoured in an instant ongli was
no more just vanished in a puff of vapor like a punc-
tured gas balloon the news of chevans perfidy would
not reach miti-oro now

  so the commander chuckled replacing his ray pistol
in the drawer from which he had taken it ongli was
eavesdropping for the last time chevan is not caught
napping easily

  pete clenched his fists and stared hopelessly at ben
their only friend in the realm was gone-though he
could have done them little good chevan was manipu-
lating the dials of the teleview now and the screen lighted
with its usual cold blow a sinister countenance faced
them from its surface beady akata eyes wandered from
one to the other and then focussed hard on those of
chevan

  miti-oro greets you chevan came a metallic voice
from the writhing lips of the apparition what is it
you wish 

  greetings oh king the commander replied in silky
tones it is to report the passing of ongli your
majesty

  ongli is dead swift anger crossed the stern visage
of the ruler of aka by whose hand

  mine your majesty chevan returned swiftly he
was plotting to return these captives to the surface and
i destroyed him the upper world would have been
warned and the campaign made more difficult onglis
knowledge of insulating material-they would learn

of the protection against our rays-

  enough chevan you have done well you will now
kill the captives  miti-oro eyed them dispassionately
cold-bloodedly

  not yet oh king they have much knowledge which
i wish to obtain some of it is vital they shall live
yet a while

  it is well chevan but guard them well

  of a certainty
tanks under the sea



  the screen dimmed and chevan turned to face his
captives a broad grin on his face you see he exulted
how chevan wraps them around his little fingers
even their king oh i tell you boys this is soft it
is like stealing candy from children

  stony-faced devil isnt he said pete irrelevantly

  yes and stony hearted but chevan has a stonier
heart go now and dont forget what you have seen and
heard but five days remain to you and in that time
remember-chevan keeps his word chevan is all-
powerful i shall await your decision

  speechless they left the presence of the double-
dealing braggart and the guards followed them more
closely as they proceeded to their own quarters

the twenty-four hour periods passed more slowly
and miserably after that days they were ac-
customed to counting them these interminable periods
that they could only keep track of by their own watches
chevan did not again send for them and a new guide
had supplanted ongli an unfriendly beast who rarely
spoke to them and who watched them with eagle eye
each day the muttering of the guards and of the akata
with whom they came in contact became more menacing

  but chevans orders evidently were being respected
they were taken wherever they wished to go and grudg-
ingly it is true given all information for which they
asked they picked up a few words of the outlandish
language and were able to make their simple wants
known they even visited the oxygen generators and
air-conditioning cells the most vital mechanisms in the
realm

  pete was becoming a puzzle to his friend and a nuis-
ance to the guards with whom he was continuously in
trouble he had developed a habit of straying away and
picking up interesting objects on several occasions
he was detected in the act of concealing some trifling
article on his person and this always brought an argu-
ment with two or more of the guards once he lost his
temper and sent one of the creatures kicking with a
mighty wallop on the chin he was immediately pounced
upon by the others and quickly wrestled into submission
but they refrained from injuring him chevan had or-
dered that their lives be spared-for seven sleeps

  most of the sixth day was passed in the assembling
shop where the great sub-tanks were put together here
they learned much more about the construction and
operation of these monster fighting machines they
learned too of their vast difference from the submarines
of the nations of the surface the radium engines were
marvelous mechanisms and caused no pollution of the
air when submerged they eliminated the need for
batteries with their danger of evolving poisonous fumes
and for coughing diesel engines when on the surface
and the fuel compartments were little more than tiny
leaden cases that occupied hardly more room than a
sailors luggage yet provided a cruising radius of twenty
thousand miles on land or sea and the armament of
these engines of destruction fourteen-inch guns that
hurled projectiles containing a high explosive ten times
more powerful than any in use on the surface ray
projectors of all kinds each deadlier than the other gas
disseminators that could wither an acre of forest at a
puff-these were but a few of the terrible implements of
warfare

  during the sixth sleeping period ben sneaked through
the connecting door and into petes room he placed his

lips close to his friends ear that the guards outside might
not overhear his conversation and to forestall any effort
of chevans in case he was listening the sound mech-
anism of his teleview

  say he whispered huskily whatre we going to
do make a show of joining up and then wait for a
chance to get away

  not on your life we gotta stall off this crazy guy
and his clever beasts if they ever get started theyll
clean up the world no fooling this war junk of
theirs is the berries nothing can stop em if they get
going

  yeah-looks bad but howre we going to stop em

  ive got a plan ben been picking up some stuff
too the junk i let em catch me with was just for a
blind

  what did you get

  plenty couple of their ray pistols and some gas
bombs a bunch of keys and some other stuff well
need

  no kidding but pete how in the devil can we
put it over on chevan and these millions of apes thatre
working for him how can we get out of here and back
home well just get ourselves bumped off and do no
good at all

  is that so listen-i said i had a plan and i have
maybe well be killed but thatll be no worse than the
way we are and ill bet we can bust up this war of
theirs too

  unconsciously they had raised their voices though
they had been most careful in this respect previously
now they were startled by a sudden commotion in the
hall the voices of chevan in loud angry tones

  here quick pete muttered thrusting a cold metal-
lic object into bens hand a ray pistol might need
it

  he rushed to snap on the lights and the two draped
themselves negligently over adjoining chairs as if they
had been engaged in an inconsequential discussion

  the door flew open and chevan pushed in at least
ten of the ugly akata behind him

  ha he bellowed so youre planning treason
didnt know my sound apparatus could pick up whispers
did you he roared a command to his minions in the
akata tongue

  pete had his feet drawn up under him and chevan
was directly before him shaking a ham-like fist in his
face he could not have heard the part about the ray
pistols or hed have had their lives by this time the
akata had drawn their own ray pistols but pete saw
that these were only of the paralyzing kind their
orders had been not to kill and these were their only
arms

  the vibratory death for both of you chevan was
shouting a lingering and excruciating agony that is
still too good for you i shall watch with delight as
your bodies tremble and oscillate with increasing in-
tensity until each joint shall have left its socket until-

  he never finished the tirade for petes feet shot forth
and caught him full in the middle a terrible trick of
the canadian wilds the commander went down with
a terrific crash and did not rise blood gushed from a
deep gash in his temple where he had struck a corner
of the metal-topped table in falling

  the two americans were on their feet now the rays
from their disintegrators flashing amongst the aston-
ished akata at each contact one of the deformed


amazing stories

 creatures shriveled in a blinding flash and a puff of vapor
 and was gone closely massed as they were seven or
 eight of them were obliterated at the first volley pete felt
 his arm go dead as a paralyzing ray struck home bens
 death ray had caught his antagonist in time to spoil
 his aim else hed have been completely paralyzed one
 of the remaining two darted for the door to spread the
 alarm they must not let him get away pete dived
 through the air and brought him down in good old
 football fashion then he straddled the malformed
 body and throttled his victim cheerfully and efficiently
 ben had accounted for the other

   first blood pete chortled as he arose and closed
 the door now lets look at the old man

   he knelt by the prostrate form of chevan and felt for
 bis pulse the commander was dead

   dead as a herring ben he said there goes an-
 other dream of an empire they always think theyre
 invincible these would-be world conquerors then some
 little thing like this-

   the shriek of a siren interrupted him

   lord groaned ben the alarm is out these apes
 are uncanny the way they learn things

   shut up pete hissed well beat em to it he
 turned out the lights

 they slipped into the passage and made for a dark
 side hall a number of hurrying akata came howl-
 ing behind them pete tossed a gas bomb in their midst
 and pulled ben into the side hall after him

   quick he whispered the small elevator well
 go down feeling was returning to his left arm and it
 pained horribly

   the automatic elevator dropped them a dozen levels
 or so at the touch of a button pete knew where they
 were going and ben did not question him

   they emerged in a dark tunnel that was cut into the
 solid rock a pocket flashlight-another of petes pick-
 ups-showed them the way

   youre heading for the magazine-where they store
 the high explosive ben gasped

  you bet well blow it to kingdom come and a
 whole corner of aka along with it he was fingering a
 small conical object

   whats that pete

  a detonator you know-off the end of a shell
 going to set it for ten minutes to give us a chance to get
 away

   ben heaved a sigh of relief he had wondered about
 that-it would be just like pete to blow them up along
 with the magazine if he thought the sacrifice would upset
 the plans of the akata

   one of the metal doors of the magazine was ahead
 a key from the bunch produced by pete opened it
 readily he struck the detonator sharply against the
 stone floor to set off the cap and start the fuse burning
 then hurled it into an open canister and closed the door

   they ran along the passage and turned into another
 that led downward these tunnels were deserted and
 unlighted during the sleeping period but soon would be
 alive with searchers they must hurry

   hovvd you learn about all these passages ben
 jerked out as they ran

   map hooked one the other day and been studying

   ben marveled at the resourcefulness and secretiveness
 of his partner hed never give him another argument

   now they were coming into a lighted chamber the
voices of a group of akata reached them

   quiet said pete well have to croak em

   they peered into the opening which was a way sta-
tion of the pneumatic tube three of the dwarfs were
waiting for a car as many flashes from their dis-
integrators accounted for them

   funny said ben as they walked to the platform
doesnt even make you feel squirmy to kill em just
like shooting woodchucks or something

   the swish of air warned them of the approach of a
car the exit door from the incoming tube popped open
and it slid alongside the door opened and they stepped
in brandishing their ray pistols

   only three passengers were in the seats two of these
being withered old creatures incapable of offering re-
sistance none of them was armed and they readily sub-
mitted to the americans who gagged them and tied their
hands and feet with cord ripped from the upholstery
these cars were automatic so there was no operator to
deal with

   pete referred to his map now next stop he an-
nounced cheerfully

   then wherell we be 

   navy yard or whatever they call it where the sub-
tanks are

   you son-of-a-gun ben exclaimed in admiration
but therell be a gang of apes there wont there
no only the watchmen the searching partiesll
never dream we could get there so quickly

   but pete was overly optimistic in this for when the
little car of the pneumatic tube pulled into the next sta-
tion they found it was alive with armed akata

   now were in for it groaned ben

   easy now pete warned well gas em

   he unclamped the door and swung it a few inches
hurling one of the egg-shaped grenades into the midst
of the crowd there was a muffled explosion and he had
the door closed once more rushing to the forward end
of the car he closed the emergency switch that made the
automatic controls inoperative reaching into the breast
of his shirt he withdrew two folded packets and handed
one to ben

   gas masks exclaimed the mechanic you think of
everything dont you 

have to pete grinned as he adjusted the protec-
tive device over his head come on now lets go
they were out in the station then climbing over piles
of bodies some still squirming in their death agonies
others inert the gas of the akata was powerful stuff

a narrow passage led from the station into the
navy yard as pete had called it and they slid
through cautiously until they came to the entrance of the
great chamber two guards were on duty at this point
and each of the americans selected one pouncing upon
them from behind and with quick grasps of their wind-
pipes throttling any possible outcry they dragged the
creatures into the passage and despatched them quickly
and silently

   now they were in the huge chamber among the sub-
tanks they skirted one of the outer walls to keep out
of sight of any of the watchmen who might be around
if only they could reach their destination before the
searchers arrived

   the lone tank which faced the giant airlock loomed
before them in the semi-darkness none of the akata
tanks under the sea



was in sight pete sneaked along beside one of the
caterpillar tracks until he reached the open manhole
of the vessel then they were inside and undetected
so far so good

  it was the work of but a moment to clamp the her-
metically sealed cover and pull the switch that turned
on all lights in the mighty war machine

  howre we going to get out asked ben

  cut our way through come on-up to the forward
turret

  a tremendous shock threw them flat the tank seemed
to have jumped a foot in the air

  what was that ben turned a white face toward
his partner

  the magazine pete grinned never think we
couldve done all this in ten minutes would you

  then there came a roaring rumble which echoed and
reverberated in the huge cavern outside coming to their
ears even through the thick double hull of the sub-tank

  geez muttered ben some bust-up

  and how ill bet fourteen levels were caved in over
in that section and i know of three air-conditioning
plants thatll be out of commission from the blast thatll
keep em guessing for some time and maybe give us
a chance to do some things

  they climbed the ladder in the central well of the sub
and made their way to the forward turret pete ex-
amined the ray projectors and selected one a shining
length of tubing with many handwheels and gadgets on
its mounting he had carefully inquired regarding the
operation of these weapons and now pulled a lever that
projected from the control box alongside the rising
whine of a great generator answered from somewhere
below

  through the thick glass of the observation port they
watched as the fusing beam cut into the heavy metal of
the airlock ahead as it bored through with a shower of
blinding sparks pete manipulated the controls of the
beam to cut away a huge circle just inside the rim of
the door

  ben peered through one of the side ports and let out a
yell that resounded terrifyingly in the narrow confines
of the turret

  theres a gang in the cavern he shouted theyre
manning one of the other tanks

  swing that other projector around and give em
hell

  how ben was nonplussed

  works just like this one you dumb-bell hop to it
now pete roared impatiently ben was a trial at
times couldnt he see that he was too busy with the
cutting process to explain

  the inner door of the airlock fell in with a crash
now the beam was at work on the outer he won-
dered if the inrushing water would quench the terrible
heat of the beam now it was through at one point and
no water entered building up steam pressure outside
probably and that would hold back the water despite its
two hundred pounds pressure to the square inch or
no-it was disintegrating the brine as fast as it poured
through-that was it he wondered how ben was
making out

  water was coming in now through the narrow slit
above the point where the beam was cutting-lots of
water but the beam still operated it was cutting
faster and faster soon theyd be through

  the outer door was driven in by the tremendous pres-

sure of the water before its last section was cut through
thousands of tons of pacific ocean came in with it and
the sub-tank was tossed about like a cork pete was
thrown violently across the turret and his head struck
something hard he staggered to his feet and made for
the control room in a daze dimly it came to him that
ben was down and out-bleeding like a pig poor old
ben

hardly knowing what he was doing he yanked
the lever that started the main generators the
answering rumble below told him that all was well with
the machinery he tried to remember the uses of the
various controls pulled this and twisted that until he
knew they were moving forward the brilliant beams
of the searchlights illuminated the jagged openings
ahead they were crawling through on their great
caterpillars

  he wiped the blood from his eyes and cursed ben
was dead-good old ben but already he was avenged
the incoming waters would drown the akata in droves
slowly and miserably he wished he could hear them
squeal overrun the americas would they  he thought
gleefully of those torrents that now were pouring
through every passage and chamber of aka finally
they would reach down to the deepest levels and flow to
the farthest corners of the realm every one of the
dirty beasts would perish and he pete caldwell would
have killed seven millions of them if the figures were
right

  the sub-tank was moving faster now over the un-
even bottom he reached for the control lever of the
ballast pump motors suddenly he yearned for a breath
of outside air god the lever was broken off short
the pumps could not be operated he would die on the
bottom-miserably like the akata

  then he thought of the tank which was being made
ready to follow them maybe ben had not been able
to put them out of commission with that ray projector
and even one of the damned things could do a lot of
damage up above he swung the great bulk of his own
sub around by reversing one of the caterpillars yes
sure as hell and high water there it was just poking
its nose out from the destroyed airlock he remem-
bered one of the ray projectors that was operative under
water lucky hed asked about that bringing the
controls to neutral he dashed for the turret once more

  when he reached the battery of ray projectors and
peered through the port he saw that a slender pencil
of orange light already was extending from the other
sub-tank playing over the metal hull of his own vessel
it was that would be the under-water beam savagely
he jerked at the controls of the one projector he could
use in the circumstances another beam of light sped
forth and he directed it at the turret from which the
other was coming there was a flash at the far end
of the beam and suddenly the first one was snuffed out
he had put it out of commission at the first try re-
lentlessly he bored into the sides of the other amphibian
bored and bored with the ray until he saw a large section
of the hull fuse away and admit the waters of the
ocean

  got em thank god he exclaimed fervently
thats the last of the scum now for sure

  whadju say a feeble voice mumbled

  ben it was ben he hadnt kicked in after all
but he would-later lord he must break it to him


amazing stories

gently water was coming in now too down below
where the devils had bored through the hull that would
make it a little quicker anyhow but ben-ben was
such a helpless bird and so dependent on him for every-
thing he hated to think hed have to fail him now

  ben he was saying as he felt over his body for
broken bones or serious wounds you all right old
man 

  sure just knocked out thats all but i didnt get
that sub-tank

  dont worry about that its all right ben

  everything okay

  y-yes

  then lets go home ben sat up and propped him-
self against the curved wall of the turret

  ben we cant the ballast pumps wont work and
besides theres water coming in were stuck    down
here    old man    done for the two of us

  his friend stared blankly for a moment why you
bonehead he said slowly whats the matter with that
thing in the super-structure you know-the detach-
able life boat affair they told us about

  ben had put one over on him at last pete did some
staring on his own account then hugged his friend de-
liriously hed forgotten this safety feature himself
good old ben

twenty minutes later they were on the surface
and had unbolted the deck cover of the small boat
they had entered through its clever air-locked attachment
to the sub-tank it had shot to the world of sunlight and
fresh air like a bullet when the release levers inside were
pulled

  they breathed deep for a long time without talking
it was good to be back to their own world even though
they were all in and a mighty long way from land

  then pete told of the fight with the other sub-tank
and ben told how he had failed in the first attempt to
wreck it it seemed there was one thing about the arma-
ment they had not known for an invisible wall of pro-
tective vibrations of some kind had been thrown around
the marvelous machine before the water came in and
the rays struck harmless against this barrier appar-
ently the barrier could not be used under water though
so pete had been successful later

  well it was a good job as it turned out pete
gloated and were mighty lucky to be here

  long way from land though ben objected looking
doubtfully at the oars and striving hard to keep from
nodding into a doze

  pete was as exhausted as his friend but he dragged
himself to the provision locker and rummaged around
amongst its contents

  ought to be a sail in the equipment somewhere he
grunted from the depths of the locker found a short
mast plenty of groub and fresh water too well make
it

  three hundred miles to auckland ben contem-
plated the effort with dismay

  pete grinned sheepishly when he came up from the

investigation of the locker guess my reckoning was
pretty punk he admitted a look at chevans chart
showed me that we are only a little more than a hundred
miles from that port they picked us up right about
here you know and i was wrong on the distance
well my estimate on the gas wasnt so hot either
said ben thought fifty gallonsd give out on us and
drop us in the drink before we were half way there
i was farther off than you were

  pete had located the sail and they prepared to step
the mast

  here you growled ben noting that his friend was
groggy you got a nasty cut on your head better
let me wash it and fix it up for you first

  dont use too much of the drinking water pete
warned sitting down weakly and submitting to bens
administrations

  it was a case of the blind leading the blind both were
so worn out they could scarcely sit up-too dazed even
to marvel at their extraordinary experiences of the past
week-too tired even to give thanks for their miraculous
escape

  eventually everything was in shape the sail set and
the tiller lashed with beckets they talked things over
in drowsy tones as the thirty foot lifeboat plowed
through a moderately choppy sea toward auckland

  well make it in a day if the breeze holds out said
ben

  easy glad i was wrong with my reckoning

  me too

  ben broke the silence again after a moment whatll
we tell em pete  he asked lazily

  tell who

  everybody the boss-the newspapers-the gang
probably been out looking for us for days theyll want
to know

  have to cook up some yarn ben plane down-
found this boat adrift sort of a miracle you know
anything but the truth have to lie out of it you know
why not the truth 

  well you are dumb whod believe a crazy yarn
like that i hardly believe it myself now its over
whod believe there was a place like aka or a bughouse
fable about a lost race planning to lick the world
sounds like a fairy tale and to make ourselves out as
heroes whove saved the entire world from disaster
dont make me laugh theyd say we were drunk no
not a word about chevan or the akata-sub-tanks either
theyd make bums out of us not heroes

  okay youre right twas good sport though   
while it lasted    good sport   

  oh sure pete saw that his friend had fallen asleep
he was on the point of slipping away himself

  serenely forgetful neither of them gave a further
thought to the dangers through which they had passed
so miraculously nor to the incalculable value of the
service they had given to an unsuspecting and defense-
less world

  adventurous yankees are like that

check up on the medical aspects of the story
adds in part please extend my personal
congratulations to the writer of this story it
is a clever conception and a fine piece of work
the psychological phases of it tickle me pink
and the surgery is far better than anything i
could have written and we might add that
one of the best features of this story is that it

 ta ut damn it doctor i cant lose my hand

      j what am i paying you for anyway youre
j  a hell of a surgeon i thought when i called
m  you that i was getting the best and now its
too late to change and you just stand there
watching my hand rot away do something and be quick
about it or ill throw you out even now and then
his voice changed oh come on now doc isnt there
something you can do

  yes there is something i can amputate and save
your arm as two days ago i could have saved your hand
if you hadnt been so confounded stubborn

  but whats a stump to an artist  fingers and hand
are what he needs oh why cant you save my hand
why should i of all people be picked to lose his hand
why wasnt it my left hand a leg oh anything but my
right hand 

  why only day before yesterday morning i was using
it on a portrait of the prince of siam and now look at
it he turned on his side and glanced at the swollen
and distorted upper extremity resting on a pillow which
hand had forty-eight hours before been so perfect

  oh great god doc look there he almost shrieked
as the doctor removed the final turn of gauze blood
poisoning has already set in there on the back of his
hand was a red and angry pustule no larger than a dime
from which oozed yellowish and very foetid pus radia-
ting up the back of his forearm were a series of red and
purple streaks see those lines doc he almost cried
thats blood poisoning and itll sure get me now ill
die ill die just in time to miss getting a picture in the
national academy oh whatll  do

  fan puyster was
wheeled in and as he
was placed upon the
table the anesthetist
asked what shall i
use doctor


amazing stories

  oh calm down a moment youre not dead yet
if you were you wouldnt make so much infernal racket
besides thats not blood poisoning-there aint no such
animal

  well i guess i know what is cant i see it

  thats the first time i knew you studied diagnosis
those years you spent in the latin quarter of paris i
understand that an artist gets a little anatomy enough to
recognize a few of the larger superficial muscles of the
body but i know that you didnt study bacteriology
in learning to mix pigments and speaking of stains
you wouldnt know whether to use grams iodine or
chrome yellow on the pathogenic organism in your
arm which in this particular case happens to be bacillus
aerogcnes capsulatus one of the chief causes of gas
gangrene

  last night you said those incisions would stop it
and this morning its ten times worse

  i didnt say it would stop it i said it might stop
it at that time i thought it was a streptococcal infec-
tion causing a cellulitis but since i have the lab report
and by its appearance today i know it to be a typical
case of gas bacillus infection with incipient gangrene
those incisions are of very slight value in this type of
infection had it been a case of cellulitis which is an
infection of the loose connective tissues we might have
saved your arm but in this instance the radical treatment
is the only kind which can be successfully applied and
youll be lucky to get off with your life

  save my life cried van puyster what goods my
life without my arm oh do something doc do some-
thing and then he sighed resignedly oh thats all
right dr evans youve been a good sport but i guess
i might as well give in the time comes only once in a
lifetime

  come on now thats enough of that shut down a
moment and listen to reason i have an alternative for
your original arm

  no you dont i dont want one of your infernal
leather and metal contraptions

  i said listen you always were a spoiled ass for
once in your pampered life try to see if you can listen
ive got to amputate and the longer you wait the more
you lose but theres a gambling chance to either win or
lose the entire arm

  do you really mean-

yes i really mean if you can keep still long enough
for me to tell you that you may have the equivalent of
your original arm or you may lose the entire extremity
you know id do or risk anything to get my hand
back

  well use all your will power again and try to listen
though i dont expect you to when i was a student
i had my thumb practically severed in fact it was cut
through the bone and dangled by a piece of skin as it
was cut by a microtome knife the wound was not abso-
lutely sterile but i was young and the professor so ac-
curately approximated the ends that circulation was im-
mediately restored there was no feeling in that thumb
for over a year because nerve fibers never unite but
grow out over the paths of old ones along the nerve
tract this is the thumb its action is not impaired in
any manner the only indication that it ever suffered a
mishap is this thin transverse scar extending almost
around it

  but whats that got to do with my arm i-

dr evans heaved a long sigh that sounded more
like a groan if you can ever overcome that most
impolite habit of interrupting ill be eternally grateful
id be willing to swear with my right hand on a grays
anatomy that the only way to make you stop is to cut
the superior laryngeal nerve

  a look of humility spread over the artists face go
ahead doc ill promise not to do it again

  when your hand first became infected i knew what
was going to happen i knew that you would not con-
sent to free incisions i realized also that with your
lowered vitality from too much indoor work that the
infection could not be stopped in anticipation of these
various events everything is in readiness for me to per-
form an operation that will give you an arm the only
necessity is your word to go ahead

  there is a condemned man in the state prison who
has agreed to sell you his arm before he dies

  but but i-

  did you wish to say something mr van puyster
asked dr evans solicitously

  no sir came back very meekly

  then to continue i agree that it is not very pleas-
ant to know that you are using the arm that has mur-
dered an unarmed man still worse to realize that the
arm is black but the manifold benefits accruing from
its use will always be a blessing to you

  do you mean to graft-

  exactly to a skillful surgeon the operation should
not be impossible

  i know it never has been done on humans but it
has been done on frogs not only has an arm been
grafted but frogs have been severed in the middle and
the posterior end of one was attached to the anterior end
of the other and that composite frog lived until its un-
timely death three weeks later by an accident

  to get to the more human possibilities of the prob-
lem skin grafts and blood transfusions are done every
day and as-both are tissue and the arm being a mass of
tissues you can see the plausibility of such an operation
if foreign blood will live in a body why not a foreign
artery bone grafts are not infrequent so there is no
reason why it is not practical to change arms or at least
an arm there is today in england a surgeon who has
closely approached this operation he has just recently
performed two similar operations both cases were much
the same the patients simply having lost their thumbs
the surgeon re-amputated the thumb just below the
stump and taking the ring finger of the same or op-
posite hand substituted it for the stump in both cases
there were excellent results and the grafted finger func-
tioned perfectly i have x-rayed both your arm and
the donors and as they are both of corresponding girth
and the arteries nerves and muscles of similar size and
location the greatest difficulty will be experienced in
joining the various veins arteries and nerves happily
where i intend to make this resection in the center of
the biceps muscle there are only two important vessels
the brachial artery and the basilic vein the other vessels
may be neglected as circulation is easily carried on by
these two there will remain then six large nerves
which may prove difficult and only four muscles and
the humerus the humerus you know is the bone of
the arm the union by suturing of the various struc-
tures should be comparatively simple for some strange
reason his blood types perfectly with yours indicating
the black hand



i presume that somewhere back in either your ancestry
or his there was a white or negro parent as the case
may be

  in this case i intend to make a direct transfer of
his arm to your stump as i do not think you would relish
being bound by the side of a condemned criminal for
ten minutes much less ten days furthermore he is
doomed to execution before that time would have ex-
pired in lieu of this i intend to employ arteriorrhaphy
or in simple terms the sewing together of blood vessels
this will of course cause an almost immediate contin-
uation of circulation

  as to the cost of the operation the negro wishes
 to go to his estate and he wants an impressive
burial i shall charge no more than my regular fee
for amputations as i greatly desire the honor of being
the first to accomplish this operation

  the negro being condemned to the lethal chamber
shall instead die under the anesthesia have i made
everything clear 

  i i think so doctor just just let me think it over

  very well i shall be back in an hour i am sorry to
so rush you but the need for the operation is most
imminent

  van puyster was so dazed that he did not answer the
doctors good by the shock to his aesthetic mind
was almost overpowering the thought of a black hand
was revolting but the thought of no hand at all was like
death itself would the hand be large and awkward or
would it be slender and sensitive was it coal black
or only a light mulatto could he ever return to his
society with such a stigma these and many others
were the thoughts he pondered over and after what
seemed like only a few minutes dr evans was back in
the room

van puyster seemed haggard and worn when
the doctor asked for his decision he gave a
sigh and said go ahead doc ive lost all the fight i
ever had

  dr evans stepped to the door and two orderlies en-
tered with a stretcher to take him to the ambulance wait-
ing outside the operation has to take place at the
prison was the doctors exposition the governor
said he could not give permission for the removal of the
negro it seems there is some law against it he took
a silver case from his coat pocket and withdrew there-
from a minute hypodermic syringe van puyster looked
on with expression akin to horror its all right the
doctor said this is just a preoperative shot its
perfectly painless and contains morphine atrophine and
scopalomine the morphine is used as an anesthetic
and sudorific the atropine and scopalomine as stimu-
lants and the scopalomine has also a sudorific effect
these ingredients greatly reduce the shock of the opera-
tion and in the argot of the street when you enter the
operating room it doesnt matter to you if the cabbage
never heads i guess ill have to leave you now but ill
see you later at the prison ill have to scrub up and
have the last minute details prepared by the time of
your arrival

  when van puyster arrived he was pleasantly
drowsy he did not even notice that the aniulance did
not drive at its usual breakneck speed he did not
notice when he was put on the wheeled stretcher to be
taken to the operating room in that room itself he did

not notice how far different it was from the usual type
the walls instead of being in the glaring white as is so
prevalent were of soft powder blue the floor was a
warm gray and covered with a seamless waterproof
compound which yielded slightly to the tread thus re-
ducing fatigue and resultant errors all the fixtures in
the room including the table itself were of gray even
the gowns were of the selfsame color-gray-and in-
stead of dragging the floor on the smaller nurses and
missing the knee of the anesthetist who was abnormally
large by three inches each person had his individual
gown which hung a uniform six inches above the floor
the skylight was of thin translucent glass which filtered
out the hard irritating sun rays but transmitted the
ultra-violet rays which are so destructive to microscopic
organisms the operating light itself was contained in
frosted crystal and lighted the field perfectly without
undue hardship on the surgeons eyes these innova-
tions which the doctor often liked to explain to visitors
were his own and as the surroundings had a soothing
effect on all within their influence the mortality from
operations within this amphitheater was considerably less
than that in the usual white operating room

  van puyster was wheeled in and as he was placed
upon the table the anesthetist asked what shall i use
doctor 

  use ethylene i think it will be best for this opera-
tion because it gives excellent anesthesia with no disa-
greeable after effect and the patient succumbs to its in-
fluences almost immediately

  the mask was fitted over his face and the ethylene-
oxygen mixture turned on in a few seconds the regu-
lar rhythm of his breathing showed that he was asleep
the negro was already anesthetized in another room and
was now wheeled in and placed on a table beside him
the sites of operation were sterilized with picric acid
solution and ether and the infected arm carefully
bandaged so none of the infected material could possibly
get to the clean areas tourniquets were applied both
above and below the sites of incision to prevent the loss
of blood the drapes were applied and dr evans and
his assistant dr aquino who had been previously in-
structed as to the procedure each began his incisions
with a marvelous high frequency knife this instru-
ment which derives its energy from the three-electrode
vacuum tube works on the principle of molecular dis-
integration the energy from the high frequency cur-
rents disintegrates the tissues in its path and leaves a
clean wound behind after the double amputation dr
evans and dr aquino began the union of the black arm
to the white

  fine black silk arterial suture please asked dr
evans we must restore circulation as quickly as pos-
sible dr aquino he continued in his finest didactic
style has cut the vessels and nerves long enough so
that suturing may be easily accomplished we will first
unite the ends of the brachial artery the normal shrink-
age of tissues will easily account for all undue slack
which may remain now having done so we will direct
our attention to the basilic vein the cephalic vein
which we see on the front of the arm we will neglect
as also we will do with the profunda brachialis artery
now let us turn our attention to the humerus you
will notice that dr aquino and myself have cut the bone
at such an angle as to make both parts coincide the

dinner had just

been finished and
for a while follow-
ing the meal
brockhurst and i
maintained a desultory conver-
sation as we sat ensconsed in the
comfortable chairs of his living-
room my eye chanced to fall
on a little book that lay on a
nearby table

  wells time machine eh

i began picking up the little
volume and thumbing the pages

  so tis ever read it

  i assured him i had and after
a brief discussion on the liter-
ary points of the story our dis-
course turned to its practical
possibilities

 looky here-what do you
think of time-traveling con-
sider it possible brockhurst
demanded

  my answer indicated that i
had an open mind on the sub-
ject its dangerous nowadays to employ the word
impossible  i concluded so darn many impossible
things have become commonplace facts that the word
hardly belongs in the vocabulary any longer so i
wouldnt say that time-traveling is impossible but since
my sentiments are conservative i wouldnt say offhand
that it is possible either i prefer at the present to re-
main neutral with reference to that question

  a commendable attitude my companion lauded
with a nod very commendable i suppose if some-
one proved to you that time-traveling is possible youd
embrace the theory

  absolutely it would be silly to close ones eyes to
a demonstrated fact

  sure thing now if i told you that time-traveling
is possible would you believe me

  i did not reply at once instead i surveyed my friend
carefully from head to toe-sleek black hair earnest
clean-shaven face with its twinkling blue eyes and tall
well-knit body in its blue serge suit brockhurst was
about thirty-eight or forty years old unmarried fairly
well off and an electrical engineer by profession

  hum-well-id believe you if you could prove

your assertion i answered at
last slowly but as long as you
just say its possible i prefer
to retain my present impartial
attitude why-have you any-
thing authentic to indicate that
it is possible 

  brockhurst laughed a little
a lot of mathematics that you
couldnt follow to save your
soul and-a time machine

  i caught my breath to stare
at him - incredulously i am
afraid

  a time machine i repeat-
ed at last with an interrogative
inflection whaddaya mean 
show me

  step right this way please
was the obliging rejoinder and
rising from his chair my host
conducted me to the workshop
at the rear of his house

  why should i bother to de-
scribe the room  it looked just
as one might expect an electrical
experimenters laboratory to look-a large stone-walled
chamber filled with all manner of electric motors and
appliances i did not recognize electricity isnt my
line you know

  at one end of the shop before a great double door
that was now closed reposed a small cabin airplane
resting on a pair of staunch rubber-tired wheels be-
tween which i saw a compact array of electric ma-
chinery

  cast an appraising eye over the first time machine
invited brockhurst with a magnanimous flourish as we
paused before the craft

  oh i exclaimed with a snicker i see all you
have to do is to climb into the trusty old crate start
the motor and soar back and forth through time like
a bird huh

  exactly

  i looked at him quizzically

  evidently he smiled at me with a merry twinkle
in his eyes evidently you are a trifle nonplussed as to
what my big idea is here you see before you a per-
fectly natural-looking monoplane evidently constructed
for the navigation of the third dimension and here i

   i great many of us have found
 stories of the past intensely ab-
 sorbing and instructive but we doubt
 whether there are many who would
 not give a good deal to go ahead into
 the future many many years-if
 their safety could be assured of
 course einstein with his generally
 un-understandable formulas and nu-
 merous theories so confusing even to
 eminent scientists has apparently
 started those scientists who think
 they do know what its all about
 planning or inventing some machine
 or something that will permit them
 to travel in time forward or back-
 ward or perhaps both it all seems
 remarkably simple and plausible
 after reading this story bv our well-
 known author this is one of the
 best fourth dimensional stories yet


  ere i had taken a step the
floating plant whipped toward
me upon its sinuous trunk and
of a sudden i was inextricably
entangled in all its writhing
snake-like whiplashes

amazing stories

am cracking a silly pointless joke to the effect that its
a time machine hence you expect an explanation and
your expectations are fully justified let me there-
fore reiterate that this is a time machine want me to
explain how it works

  naturally-if you want to vindicate your purpose
in dragging me out here

  very well then brockhurst seated himself on a
table close by motioning me to take my place beside
him ill try to explain its rudiments as briefly as i
can first ill have to give you a sketch of its prin-
ciple so that you may appreciate its operation do you
know anything about einsteins relativity theory

  a little i confessed after a mementary pause not
much

  good i suppose then that you know what a
world-line is

  i	nodded and to show him i meant it answered
aloud a world-line is a continuous succession of
point-events in a four-dimensional space or in other
words it is the path pursued by any particular body
through space and time it is the bodys trajectory so
to speak

  thats the idea yelled brockhurst slapping me
on the back his enthusiasm was too great i felt he
was poking fun at me for instance he went on
if that body were not traveling through space its world-
line would extend only into time or the four dimen-
sion as some people call it now then if we pick any
particular point on that world-line-say the point a x
xs xt designated by the dimensions x y z and t-
it follows that the adjoining point on each side will be
the direction of the fourth dimension from our se-
lected world-point that is the one point-x x x
x-will be in the future of our designated point
while the other-x x x -will be in the past you
understand 

  perfectly

  all right now-heres where we get to the core
of the matter do you know that the fourth dimen-
sion need not necessarily be time

  i	stared at him blankly

  it makes no difference whether or not we regard
the fourth dimension as time brockhurst went on
after a moment to all practical purposes the fourth
dimension and time are identical but-according to
a certain scientist named turner the fourth dimen-
sion is not time but a certain constant multiplied by
time and that constant is the velocity of light thus
if we let w represent the fourth dimension of space we

have	w-ct

where c is the velocity of light- miles per sec-
ond-and t is any period of time we choose to work
with

  since velocity is distance divided by time we can
make this equation a little more specific by writing it
this way	w-ltt

in which i is the unit of distance- mile-and
t is the time required for light to cover that distance
or one second from this we can see that every body
travels  miles into the fourth dimension every
second

  upon this assertion of dr turner i based certain
calculations of my own which eventually culminated in
this time machine here i wont go into the details

  right now but briefly it occurred to me that those
equations i just gave you were subject to relativity
that a particles velocity through space must also influ-
ence its progress along the fourth dimension

  time as we know it is not universally absolute the
rate of its passage depends to a great extent upon the
velocity of its observer with regard to some certain ref-
erence system a moving clock will run slower with-
respect to a selected co-ordinate system than a sta-
tionary one according to the lorentz-fitzgerald for-
mula the time of either clock is

    t

         t - -

                        yl - irc

where t is the clocks rate when it is stationary v is its
velocity through space and c is the velocity of light

  brockhurst stopped in order to shift his position
then he resumed

  let me give you an example imagine two asteroids
in space  miles apart for the sake of sim-
plicity we will assume they are stationary in space at
least in relation to each other on one of these aster-
oids which we will call a we place two observers hav-
ing watches which run at the same rate when at rest
one observer o has a space-flier capable of attaining
enormous speeds now at a given instant which is
the same for both observers o starts his space-flier and
at the velocity of  miles per second flies from
asteroid a to asteroid b the second observer s re-
maining on a watches and times the flight of his com-
panion remarking that exactly one second is required
for o to make his trip from a to b o however like-
wise times his trip and he finds that only half a second
was needed for the journey the reason of course is
that his watch ran only half as fast as normally while
he was flying through space from a to b

  now this idea it occurred to me must also apply
to turners suggestion of the fourth dimension if
there is no absolute time in the world there is no abso-
lute gauge wherewith to measure our progress along the
fourth dimension the corrected equation then be-
comes	 rj 

                    w - ltt

t being the rate of time-passage to a stationary particle
and t being the rate of a moving particle and t of
course has the value expressed in the lorentz trans-
formation equation which i gave you before more
specifically therefore the actual equation of a bodys
extension into the fourth dimension is

w-   -  t

             vi - ve

  again brockhurst paused and took a deep breath be-
fore he plunged anew into his discourse

  do you see the implication it is simply that there
is no absolute rate of motion into the fourth dimen-
sion  time or more accurately passage through the
fourth dimension as far as concerns any particular
body depends upon the velocity of that particle through
space if its velocity equals that of light there is no
apparent passage of time as measured from that body
if the velocity is zero the rate of time-passage is at its
maximum

  that idea forms the basis of my time machine par-
ticles traveling through space at different velocities have
different extensions into the fourth dimension the
via the time accelerator



thing to do in order to travel into the future or the
past of a certain world-point is to alter ones velocity
with reference to that point

  the only way in which we seemed likely to accom-
plish this was through particle vibration no appar-
ent passage of time can be measured from an atom or
other particle which does not vibrate time becomes
inexistent to that particle thus a particle which is vi-
brating at a certain rate has a different space-time re-
lationship than a second particle vibrating at some other
frequency the two particles pass through the fourth
dimension at different velocities

  having this idea in mind i constructed that elec-
trical machinery which you see attached to the bottom
of the plane between the wheels that is the real time
machine and it does nothing more nor less than so alter
the period of vibration of the protons and electrons
composing the plane its occupant and the time machine
itself that their rate of progress through the fourth
dimension can be controlled at will that is the plane
can be made to occupy different moments of time at
the desire of the operator there thats the whole
long and short of it the time-traveler sits in the cabin
and starts the electric vibrator regulates its frequency
to suit himself and moves back and forth through the
fourth dimension from world-point to world-point as
he lists

  but why attach the machine to an airplane i
asked deeply impressed by brockhursts words

  for safetys sake this time machine is also a bona
fide airplane and when traveling through time it is
high above ground just imagine the sad tale of the
time-voyager who makes his journey on the surface of
the ground and upon halting his machine finds himself
enclosed in a solid mountain or resting on the waves
of a mighty sea no-the safest course is to be up in
the air when time-traveling so that upon arriving at
ones destination one can move about as one desires
without fear of drowning or being crushed under tons
of rock

  for a while we sat and stared at the plane then
i rose and went over to inspect it

  did you ever travel in time with it brockhurst
 demanded

  no

  i stopped and glared at him

  yet you seem pretty all-fired sure it will work how
do you know it will your mathematics may tell you
itll work all right but will it

  it will brockhurst assured me i know i made
a model and sent it into the fourth dimension-though
im not quite sure in which direction-future or past-
it went

  are you ever going time traveling with this thing
i inquired designating the time machine

  i certainly am was the immediate reply tomor-
row morning at  a m i set forth into the fourth
dimension to take a peek at our little old earth of the
future be here to see me off will you

  i will-and if it doesnt work ill guy the life out
of you-dont forget

  and together we returned to the living room

promptly at  the next morning brockhurst
clambered into the cabin of his airplane time ma-
chine closed the door and moved his hand to the con-

trols in a minute he was taxying swiftly across the
open field behind his house soon-rising into the quiet
air and heading eastward he spiraled up to about a
hundred yards above the ground then i saw a battery
of electron-tubes in the time machine on the crafts bot-
tom flash into light

  for a while they glowed brightly as the plane droned
along its circular path overhead but presently i saw
that their light was dimming and that something was
happening to the plane the throbbing roar of its en-
gine was becoming duller-and then before my very
eyes the craft grew indistinct and vanished dissolving
into nothingness like the figment of a dream

  yet even as the ship disappeared in the empty sky i
heard behind me the sound of a wheeled vehicle racing
over the ground and spinning on my heel i beheld in
unutterable amazement brockhursts time-machine roll
to a halt a few paces distant but was it the same
craft i peered at it more intently yes it was-no
it was not still- by heaven it was at that worn
stained coated with the gray impalpable dust of count-
less centuries braced and bound together by metal
strips that it might not fall apart still it was the same
in spite of its vastly changed appearance some inner
voice assured me of the fact

  to corroborate my inward assurance the glass door
of the cabin opened and out clambered-brockhurst
but how changed whereas a few minutes before he
had been in high spirits neatly garbed and clean now
his clothing hung in tatters from a bruised scarred
body covered with red welts and blood-crusted
scratches his face was pale and distraught smeared
with dust and grime while his hair hung in tangled
masses down over his eyes

  hullo he greeted me as he emerged from the
plane still here huh  i didnt miscalculate any then
come into the hut lets eat im as hungry as a wolf

  first i only gawked at him like a silly fool finally
i found my powers of speech but-but- i stut-
tered in utter confusion weve just had breakfast
brockhurst-half an hour ago or so say-whats
happened to you anyway didnt the experiment
work 

  he halted to stare at me a funny little smile curling
his lips

  sure it worked im just coming back from my
time-trip

  but-but hell i protested you just left-not two
minutes ago i saw your ship disappear only a second
before this one stopped here behind me

  brockhurst sat down suddenly on the ground and
commenced to roar you ought to see the look on your
face he gasped at last honest you look so flabber-
gasted- anew he broke into laughter

  i dont mind admitting i am flabbergasted i re-
joined dryly greatly relieved to see that brockhursts
injuries were not serious and evidently had not affected
his spirit if youd be kind enough to explain i con-
tinued possibly my bewilderment would be somewhat
mitigated

  rather weakly brockhurst rose from the ground
he nodded lets go in-ill tell you all about it he
offered yes i know i started my trip into the future
only a few minutes ago i saw myself leave you see
i returned from my time-voyage a few seconds before
i began it barely had i stopped the time machine and


amazing stories

commenced to land behind you when i saw myself
spiraling up and vanishing into the fourth dimension

  yes i have really been in the future-to the extent
of a million years and i spent a whole night and nearly
a day there

  we were now in his kitchen where he slumped
wearily into a chair while i began to prepare a substan-
tial meal for him

  the fact that i had nothing to eat during those
twenty or twenty-one hours i spent there is what makes
me so damn ravenous now make it a little snappy
will you please this from brockhurst of course

  keep your shirt on keep your shirt on i soothed
your grubs coming along now go and wash up a
little-take a shower-youre positively filthy havent
they any baths in the year  ad and put
some mercurochrome on those cuts-or iodine or pe-
roxide or something

  obediently brockhurst half stumbled into the bath-
room whence i soon heard the rush of water issuing
presently my friends snorting and blowing became
dimly audible through the heavy door and when five
minutes later he emerged clad in a heavy bath robe he
was to all appearances a new-made man-fresh clean-
shaven and humorous my genial host of the earlier
hours of the day prior to the commencement of his
time journey

  his mid-morning luncheon awaited him upon the
kitchen table where he fell avidly to it while i unable
to resist the temptation to join him sat down to coffee
and buns

  eating was serious business to brockhurst laying
claim to all his attention so he did not speak until he
had finally shoved away his plate and sat back in his
chair accepting the cigarette i proffered

  well he began then after a good puff i presume
youre waiting for my story

  i nodded start from the beginning

  very well then-here goes

  i shall try here to repeat his tale as accurately and
as nearly as possible in his own words thus employing
the first person but because they seem to be confusing
cumbersome and useless shall with my readers kind
indulgence omit quotation marks however partly be-
cause of my own faulty memory and partly because i
found it necessary to revise brockhursts original rhet-
oric in order to make the narrative suitable for publi-
cation i must warn the reader that this rendition is
apt to be somewhat colored by my own style of expres-
sion i am confident though that my reader will par-
don this slight deviation from the original form this
then is brockhursts story of his voyage into the year
of grace 

as the solid earth of my private landing-field sloped
- away rapidly below me swinging around in a
mighty circle as my plane spiraled upward into the mid-
morning air i must confess that all varieties of strange
doubts assailed me concerning the unparalleled venture
upon which i was embarking was it not i questioned
myself the height of folly thus to tamper with the in-
finite mysteries of time and space-to thrust myself
through the coming centuries to a period yet uncon-
ceived with conditions still unconjectured after all-
would the experiment prove successful to be sure
i had sent a small model of my time machine into the

fourth dimension but so paradoxical so grotesque so
unreal did the entire matter appear that my reason re-
fused to accept the testimony of mathematics and ex-
periment and granting that success did attend my
hairbrained undertaking what circumstances what
occurrences awaited me in the distant eon i was setting
forth to visit

  might i not come to a period where human life was
impossible on the world or might i not enter an era
when humanity was subjugated by some mightier type
of life might not i perish in the course of my time-
voyage or in the age i was intending to visit would
i ever return to the present

  i had already closed the switch that started the time-
accelerator attached to the plane but so strongly did
these various questions prey upon my mind that i was
sorely tempted to open the circuit again and abstain 
from my foolhardy idea of flying into a future era
yet as my hand lingered on the insulated handle of the
switch my eye caught something in the serene blue
heavens to my left i looked first only a dim indis-
tinct blur was discernible but swiftly it materialized
into a definite concrete shape-it was an airplane and
between its landing-wheels i descried a compact ma-
chine which even at that distance i recognized as a
time-machine my time-machine attached to the very
plane in which even now i rode evidently then i
was going into the fourth dimension and i was coming
back-for had i not just seen myself return out of the
fourth dimension and commence to glide down toward
my own house

  that decided me all my doubts were answered and
allayed all would be well so i turned the dial that
regulated the vibratory rate of the time machine and
my plane and in a few more seconds i was slipping
swiftly into the future

  paradoxical i should say i had seen myself re-
turn from my time-trip before i had started it had i
not seen that return i would not have commenced that
strange journey and so could not have returned in
order to induce me to decide that i would make the
journey

  when the time machine beneath the fuselage of my
plane was fairly in action the world that lay below be-
came a blurred mass of ever-changing shades the
surface of the ground beneath me heaved and swelled
like a stormy sea as with the passing centuries its level
rose and fell gray and silent like the spectres of long-
dead worlds and civilizations towering buildings
flashed into and out of existence mighty cities spread
and dwindled like fog before the sun forests and
lakes rivers and hills flitted through time below me
momentary landmarks in the course of the ages that
were rushing by my plane outside my machine time
was speeding past at incredible velocity but within my
craft it passed as normally as ever

  there was no distinction between day and night
overhead stretched a deep blue haze through which a
broad silver-gold band marked the progress of the sun
but the most fascinating thing to me was to watch the
progress of the stars at the speed with which i was
shooting through the fourth dimension they showed as
fine silver lines circling curling spiraling and streaking
through the blue skies

  for what to me seemed like about half an hour i
maintained this rate of passage along the fourth dimen-
via the time accelerator



sion then at length i determined to halt my machine
and inspect the world of the future

  before the start of my journey i had set my auto-
matic controls to stop after the passage of one million
astronomical years and as the figures on my dials
neared this number i commenced to decrease the vibra-
tional action of the time-accelerator slowing down my
headlong flight through time until when my instru-
ments registered the passing of one million years i
threw open the switch and came to a halt in the fourth
dimension-or to be more precise reduced my velocity
through it to that with which you are moving through
it then i gazed out of the plane to see what appear-
ance was presented by the world of  a d
and what a scene i looked upon

  fading away to the horizon on every hand stretched
a vast level sandy plain bathed in the reddish light of
the low-hanging afternoon sun a range of low crum-
bling red cliffs lay on the northern edge of the world
forming a natural barrier between earth and sky be-
tween me and the distant cliffs the sandy plain was
dotted with immense green things of globular appear-
ance which i took to be plants of some nature this
assumption was soon to be verified

  then as my craft circled around to head south my
eyes discovered the most interesting thing of all-there
below and before me its hither edge not more than a
mile distant sprawled a mighty city of titanic blue
stone structures grim and massive like medieval feu-
dal castles save that they were more squat and solid
in appearance hundreds of those great buildings stood
silent and sombre in the bloody glow of the dying sun
no sign of life could i detect in their vicinity-no hurry-
ing throngs no wisp of smoke no sound of traffic or
industry to all appearances the city was deserted

  shutting off the motor of my plane i descended to-
ward the city in a long gentle glide intently studying
the strange structures as i did so the conviction that
the city had long been forsaken and crumbling into
decay became ever stronger as i neared it and the edi-
fices at its edge became more distinct yes-for dec-
ades possibly for centuries few if any living beings
had occupied that once mighty center of a vanished
civilization then i slightly drew back the control rod
of my plane the wheels bumped once or twice over the
sand and i rolled to a stop about a hundred yards from
the nearest of the massive buildings

  tentatively i poked my head out of my cabin and
sniffed the air though a trifle thinner than in the
twentieth century was of a very exhilarating quality
which led me to presume that it possibly contained an
excess percentage of oxygen i could see no form of
life about me with the exception of the immense ball-
shaped plants so i stepped out upon the level sand to
meditate upon a course of procedure now that i was
here in the year  what was to be done

  the air of mystery-of incredibly ancient mystery-
which prevailed over the enormous city at my side
captured me so i had little to ponder concerning my
immediate course of action the city stood there await-
ing me and it would be silly to neglect the opportunity
to explore it

  accordingly closing the door of the airplane cabin
behind me i set out to investigate the silent ominous
ruins that brooded on the desert before me

  on my way i took occasion to give more careful

attention to the scattered globular plants that grew out
of the sandy earth they were as i believe i have already
mentioned a very dark green in color enormous in size
ranging from eighteen to twenty feet in diameter from
their bottoms grew hundreds and hundreds of long thin
delicate pink tentacles that were apparently roots for
they extended into the soil i observed that the great
globes themselves did not rest upon the ground but
were stationed about two or three feet above it seem-
ingly supported by the countless dozens of pink roots
it appeared ridiculous however to imagine that those
frail slender supple tentacles could possibly support
those gigantic globes so i perforce surmised that the
globes themselves were hollow and filled with some
lighter-than-air gas-being in fact natural balloons
anchored by the pink roots that this supposition was
correct i was soon to learn-unpleasantly

  my walk to the city was leisurely and somewhat cau-
tious i always remained in a direct line with my plane
that i might flee to it in the event of necessity for
though i felt certain that no danger threatened from
the crumbling city still i did not blind myself to the
fact that there was a chance that it was inhabited
by creatures who might entertain hostile intentions to-
ward me

  as i have already stated at the time of my arrival
in this future day it was already late in the afternoon
the sun hanging upon the lip of the western horizon
when i was still some fifty feet from the nearest struc-
ture-a gigantic cubicular affair topped by several flat-
topped round towers-the last rays of the day star
faded away altogether leaving the world in a twilight
that swiftly grew into dusk

  at this i halted to reconsider my intention of explor-
ing the ancient city my curiosity concerning it spurred
in me a desire to examine it by torchlight if necessary
while common sense urged me to refrain from foolish
proceedings and wait for the morrow and while i
stood thus deliberating i suddenly felt a soft caressing
touch upon the back of my neck-and then another
upon my cheek

  with a start i spun around facing my plane-only
to stagger back in amazement at what i beheld hang-
ing low in the evening air behind and above me was
one of the monstrous globular plants a mighty dark
green ball fully eighteen feet in diameter hundreds
of its slender pink whip-like lashes dangled from its
bottom forming a writhing net of menacing cords
while from among them a long sinuous green trunk
extended from the gas-distended globe to the level sand
its lower end terminating in a sucking cup-shaped
mouth that evidently acted as a natural vacuum-cup to
anchor the floating plant to the ground

  a dozen thin pink roots uncurled and stretched out
toward me and again i felt their questioning caress on
throat creek and brow a qualm of nausea of unutter-
able loathing swept over me then with a low inarticu-
late cry i dodged aside to flee

  but ere i had taken a step the floating plant whipped
toward me upon its sinuous trunk and of a sudden
i was inextricably entangled in all the hundreds of its
disgusting writhing snake-like whiplashes-some no
thicker than a needle others more than an inch in
diameter and possessed of a strength comparable to
that of the boa constrictor

  like a babe in the arms of a strong man i was lifted


amazing stories

high into the air by the monstrous malignant plant
with the fury of unreasoning terror i struggled with
my gigantic soulless captor shouting biting wriggling
and kicking with all my power but my efforts availed
me nothing save to exhaust me and enmesh me the more
in the merciless grip of those crushing tentacles my
clothwere ripped to tatters blue swellings and bloody
cu  showed on my skin where the rope-like arms of the
gieat plant had squeezed and torn my body torn-
yes-torn several of the tentacles that strange fight
taught me had fine needle-like spikes near their ends
which scratched and cut me in dozens of places

  now i discovered that the monstrous plant had left
the ground and was slowly floating upward while doz-
ens of small sucking mouths attached themselves to
the open wounds of my body to draw in the life-blood
that flowed from them

  a groan of dismay broke from me was this to be
my fate-to die out here in this man-forsaken era
beneath the sucking lips of a vampire that belonged
to the realms of hell no-no i couldnt die that
way somewhere i had a large-bladed pocket-knife
in my possession if only i could get it-

  anew i began to fight and struggle my hand work-
ing gradually toward my right hip pocket the beast-
plant that held me constricted its powerful arms crush-
ing my ribs together and wrapping a choking tentacle
around my neck soon my breath was stopped and my
head commenced to reel my vision became blurred and
misty my eyes watered profusely lord i couldnt
fight any longer-

  somehow my fingers gripped the knife that lay in
my pocket with one hand i opened both its blades and
then i started to cut vaguely i felt the blades encounter
yielding surfaces and presently the pressure of the
entangling lashes began to lessen at last my right
hand was free already i hung on the brink of uncon-
sciousness when my knife at length found the pitiless
tentacle which was throttling the life from me and
commenced to saw upon it luckily the strand was a
slender one so it took but a few moments ere it was
sundered and the deadly pressure against my throat
was relieved unwrapping the coiled arm of the plant
from about my neck i flung it away to return then
to severing the remainder of the writhing lashes after
what seemed hours of frantic slashing the strongest
of them were cut through while the lesser of them
were not sufficiently powerful to restrain me from
breaking loose released of their tight clutch i slipped
downward through the writhing net and plunged
heavily to the sand beneath-free

  during the course of my aerial battle with it the
flying plant had floated a number of yards eastward
ascending to an altitude of eighteen or twenty feet
my drop of some twelve feet to the smooth packed
sand underfoot had considerably shaken and bruised
me leaving me trembling and exhausted as i lay half
dead upon the ground my teeth chattered in my shud-
dering as i thought with cold sweat exuding from
every pore of my body of the grisly fate that i had
just escaped by the barest of margins

  when i had slightly recovered my breath and
strength i grasped my knife and staggered giddily to
my feet then i turned to the time machine resting
upon the desert a hundred yards away

  but i had not taken two steps in its direction when

i halted my heart leaping clustered around the plane
their long pink snake-like tentacles running inquisi-
tively over it from end to end were fully a dozen of
the titanic globular plants others hung in the air
over it or between me and the plane while several
were drifting slowly toward me

  i shouted hoarsely then turned about and fled pre-
cipitately to the shelter of the nearest great building
that loomed ominously out of the gathering gloom
here i stumbled up a low series of steps and plunged
through a rectangular crumbling stone aperture that
gave entrance to the structure within i found myself
in a long dust-covered corridor dirtily lighted by a row
of small grimy luminous glass globes that the place
had been in disuse for a long period was amply testified
to by the cracked walls the many broken lights and
the gray dust that lay inch-thick upon the uneven floor

  turning into the first doorway at my left i entered
a dimly-lighted rectangular room of sizable dimensions
sparsely furnished with an age-old table and a few
chairs while against one wall stood a low broad couch
piled with ancient cloths apparently in some bygone
day this had been the apartment of some long-dead
inhabitant of this desolate decaying city

  in the nearest chair i sat down to speculate the
situation in which i found myself certainly was not an
enviable one i was without food or drink in a world-
old pile of ruins where there possibly existed not a
single drop of water or a crumb of bread weapons
i had none save my puny pocket-knife and surround-
ing the city on every hand were countless hundreds of
immense formidable vampire-plants any one of which
stood an excellent chance of bringing about my doom
my precious time machine was effectively guarded by
those enormous flying beast-plants so i had practically
no chance whatever to reach the plane let alone escape
with it

  yet-i would escape with it for all that it was so
decreed had i not with my own eyes seen myself
appear out of the fourth dimension back there in the
twentieth century and glide down to my landing-
field surely then i was destined to return to my
own age safe and sound

  just then my ears caught a soft stealthy sound
behind me like the tread of a padded foot with
thumping heart i spun around in my chair my imagi-
nation picturing weird and terrible creatures creeping
upon me from behind but the very fact that my eyes
awaited some amazingly unusual entity some awful
thing of monstrous form caused me to be only the
more astonished at what i beheld for that which met
my gaze was the most commonplace thing in the world
-it was a man yet so incongruous so utterly foreign
did the familiar and commonplace seem in this
grotesque unreal world that i was prone to attribute
his presence to some trick of my own imagination
however despite all that he was real

  old and wrinkled toothless and bald he was with
a coffee-brown skin whose texture suggested leather
he stood about five feet nine in height clad in a simple
white cloth tunic lashed about his waist by a broad belt
from which depended two pockets one at each hip
the one contained a long knife the other a contrivance
that appeared to be some form of revolver

  a minute passed during which the strange man and
i regarded each other in silence then he spoke-in
via the time accelerator



a tongue that despite its odd accent and unfamiliar pro-
nunciation i recognized as english

  are you anton brockhurst were the old fellows
opening words

  at that i almost sat down on the floor what i
cried in utter amazement

  are you anton brockhurst he repeated you
must be my history tells me that there was but one
man alive on earth when anton brockhurst came out
of the past in his time machine i am the last man
therefore you must be brockhurst

  honestly you could have knockcd me over with a
feather so astounded so utterly flabbergasted did the
ancient ones words leave me that i could but stand and
gape at him in thunder-stricken silence i was gasping
like a fish out of the water as i slowly gathered my wits
to reply to the old mans speech at last i was able
to articulate

  what-what-how    yes i am- anton brock-
hurst but how do you know my name i stammered
have-have we met before i-im afraid i cant
place you

  imagine me jawing such ridiculous rot to a man who
lives a million years after us

  the old fellow smiled at my evident perplexity

  i thought so-i knew so he said when i was
not yet the last human being on earth i learned from
my history tablets which were written about five hun-
dred thousand years ago that one anton brockhurst
a native of the year  a d built a time machine
with which he traveled a million years into the future
where he found the last man the last man desir-
ing to see others of his kind before he died prevailed
upon brockhurst to return with him in the time
machine into the past-to the year  a d
where the machines arrival was duly recorded in the
histories when the last man was born half a mil-
lion years later he read those histories and thus he
knows now that his rescuer is named brockhurst all
very simple is it not

  sitting weakly on my chair i nodded my mind
was tumbling with doubts and wonderings once more
i was confronted by one of the inexplicable paradoxes
of timetraveling here this man had learned my name
before i told it to him he had learned his own future
before it transpired through history books written half
a million years before his birth and yet that future of
his could not have been written into the histories of
 a d if it had not first occurred

  tiredly i shook my head the riddle was too deep
for me yes-even for me the man who invented the
first time machine

  but-but said i at length i dont know if i can
take you with me into the past my time machine is
constructed to accommodate but one person

  but you must take me with you you will take
me with you i know it you cannot desert me here
in this god-forsaken manless age tell me tell me
that you will take me with you

  well ill see what i can do i promised but
frankly i dont see how im going to do it

  but you will find a way the history books say
that i did come to the year  i want to see
other humans once more before i die for nearly sixty
years i have been the last representative of our kind
on the earth yes you must find a way

  ill try i assured him and for a long time we
lapsed into silence

  where-where am i i finally inquired what
city is this and to whom does it belong how old
is it

  this is the city of kur responded the last man
drawing up a second chair and dropping into it it is
a remnant of the last civilization which began about
six hundred thousand years ago and reached its hey-
day around  a d a hundred and fifty thou-
sand years later at about  a d it began to
decline and by  a d it was almost completely
wiped out it destroyed itself as all its predecessors
the prehistoric civilizations destroyed themselves greed
and avarice lust for power oppression of the weak and
rebellion of the untutored-it is the same old circle over
and over again they rise they flourish and they fall

  when the wars and revolutions had blotted out cul-
ture art and science the peoples of the earth were
reduced to the savagery from which they had sprung
and then it was the advent of the martian vampire-plant
that completed the ghastly story by killing off the igno-
rant unprotected barbarians who once had been the
lords of the earth in the last hundred thousand years
the toll of human lives taken by flying plants was so
enormous that the perpetuation of the race was placed
hopelessly into the shadow now you see the result-i
am the last man up to sixty years ago there still
remained three or four of us but the others too died of
old age or were captured unawares by the floating plants
and killed

  the flying plants-they are of martian origin i
asked the last man nodded in reply

  i have had an unpleasant experience with one myself
i went on i gather from their appearance that they
are hollow and filled with a lighter-than-air gas

  quite so agreed the last man with a nod they
are filled with hydrogen gas which they extract from
the water-vapor in the air and also from the moisture
in the ground it is their presence which has made a
desert of our world even our oceans are fast receding
before them in a hundred thousand more years there
will be no more water on earth they are transforming
our entire planet to a vast desert just as they have trans-
formed mars to a desert the gigantic waterways built
on their planet by the ancient martians are covered with
iiuge swarms of these plants seeking to drain up the
last few drops of water so that the hydrogen may be
extracted and stored in their hollow bodies for the
same reason they attack animals or other plants con-
taining water-to suck forth the liquid expel the oxygen
and retain the hydrogen that they may float around more
i wonder to what purpose all their mad blood-greed is
it seems to me that their existence must be as aimless as
was that of man

  evidently the fact that you are the last man has
placed you in a position to judge your species said i
wishing the old fellows philosophy were less pessimistic
knowing the faults and foolish deeds of your ances-
tors

  the last man smirked and having nothing to look
forward to he rejoined when i am dead-then
what  the human race has come and gone with nothing
to look forward to he rejoined when i am dead-
then what the human race has come and gone with
nothing to mark its one-time glory its might and its


amazing stories

world importance except a few old piles of crumbling
masonry that soon will follow their builders to the primal
dust whence they came were you a woman there
might yet be a glimmer of hope but you are a man

  and glad of it i thought

  aloud i turned the conversation again upon the flying
plants

  you say that these vampire-plants came from the
planet mars how did that ever happen

  ah it is suspected that they were deliberately
brought to this world during the last martio-tellurian
war in  ad by the invading fiends from the
red planet was ever a more hellish plot conceived
knowing that our entire civilization culture and prog-
ress depended upon that most precious element water
the martians brought along young vampire-weeds from
their world and released them upon our own

  considering the tremendous rate of growth which the
plants have-they develop from seed to maturity in the
course of a single day a condition which was necessitated
in their evolution by the extreme atmospheric changes
that take place upon their native planet-it is not to be
marveled at that in a comparatively short time our oceans
commenced to disappear our atmosphere became dry and
moistureless and our fertile soil changed into an inhos-
pitable hot red dust in addition thousands of humans
and animals fell prey to the greedy tentacles of the flying
vampire-weed our nutritive vegetation withered and
died away in the dry soil and through lack of rainfall
is it any wonder then that our mighty civilization which
so proudly boasted of conquering the universe collapsed
and decayed before the rudimentary intelligence or in-
stinct of the vampire-plants

  i did not reply for this topic of the downfall of man
had become most distasteful to me so we sat in silence
for a time then the old fellow asked suddenly where
is this time machine of yours

  i told him and upon his request narrated the entire
story of my voyage from  ad to  ad

  when i had completed the tale he suggested that we
obtain some much-wanted rest-a proposal to which i
readily acceded being rather exhausted from my vicissi-
tudes since my arrival in  ad accordingly
at the last mans gesture i cast myself upon the broad
couch that was his bed while he extinguishing the light
by pressing a button in the wall lay down beside me
the last thing i recall before i dropped off to sleep is the
last mans voice reaching me out of the darkness

  and tomorrow you will take me with you into the
past 

  the old fellows persistence irritated me why
couldnt he wait until morning when i would be in a
better condition to think it over  so rather tartly i an-
swered 

  i really dont see how i can do it frankly its im-
possible

  the last man said no more and presently we fell
asleep-at least i did

already the sun stood well up over the eastern
horizon when my lids slowly opened i turned my
head to see whether the last man still slept but found
that he had apparently already risen

  sitting up i stretched and yawned and rubbed the
slumber out of my eyes then i rose to my feet and
walked across the floor of the chamber to the doorway

that opened to the corridor intending to inquire of my
strange host whether one might have water wherewith
to cleanse oneself and whether anything edible was to be
had in the ancient city of kur

   but the old man was not to be seen in the corridor out-
side the chamber so turning to my right i sauntered
along the gallery to the rectangular entrance way and
here glanced cautiously about in the vicinity of the struc-
ture nothing stirred

  casting my eyes toward the time machine which rested
on the sand a hundred yards to my right i beheld a
sight that made my heart jump scattered on the desert
around the plane were a dozen or more great torn leaf-
like things that i saw were exploded vampire-plants
while a number of others hovered in the air surround-
ing the machine even as i looked one of them burst
with a terrific noise just as a toy balloon does when
suddenly pricked by a pin i am quite sure now that i
know what caused the plants explosion it was the sun-
light under the growing heat of the suns rays the
hydrogen gas so greatly expanded within the mem-
braneous globular bag that finally the thin skin was
unable to resist the increasing gas pressure and broke
open the bursting plants scatter afar the seeds or
spores which take root in the soil and grow with in-
credible speed during the daylight hours when night
comes they break loose from the soil and float up into
the air-the huge bloodthirsty monsters of my previous
evenings experience the next morning the sunlight
bursts them again

  yet it was not this which riveted my attention it was
the sight of the last man standing beside the time ma-
chine his revolver-like instrument glittering in his hand
the door of the planes cabin yawned open and from
the looks of things he had been minutely inspecting the
craft

  i shouted at him and waved my arm at the same time
breaking into a run toward him he shot a hasty glance
in my direction then in rapid succession five flashes of
red flame spat from his gun and at each shot a hovering
vampire-plant vanished in a thunderous explosion of
yellow fire in a trice only a few flakes of blackened ash
were swirling through the air where previously had hung
the grim flying plants

  the last of them had hardly disappeared when the
last man ducked into the cabin of the plane slamming
the door behind him before i guessed what he was up
to the ships propeller began to spin i have a self-
starter in the craft so that the pilot can spin the propeller
by himself from within the cabin and when i was still
fifty yards distant it was roaring lustily a moment later
the plane commenced to roll off across the sands gather-
ing momentum as she did so and as i came to a halt with
a dawning realization of the old scoundrels purpose she
rose gently off the ground and sped skyward in an east-
erly direction

  a shout of horror of despair leaped from my throat
and an imperative call for him to halt to return but i
doubt whether he even heard me a minute later with
sinking heart i watched the machine become a misty blur
in the blue skies overhead and vanish into time with
a low groan i slumped limply to the desert sands and
buried my face in my arms

  what a fate had overtaken me here i was ma-
rooned in time in a distant age of the future without
means of returning to my own era stranded in a world
via the time accelerator



of crumbling ruins of fruitless earth populated only by
the weird vampire-plants from an alien planet and worst
of all-i was alone alone that was what made the
terrible blow doubly cruel had i had even a single
companion to share my miserable exile the overwhelm-
ing despair that weighed me down would have been at
least slightly mitigated by the consolation of knowing
that there was another human being nearby but to be
left thus alone-the only creature of my species upon the
planet-was almost more than i could bear

  wearily i raised my head rose to my feet and walked
unsteadily toward the crumbling city of kur i did not
know whither i was going neither did i care bitter
self-reproach filled my mind i should have promised
the last man that i would return to the past with him
then he would not have stolen the machine what a fool
i had been in the first place even to think about time
traveling what a misguided ass i had been to start out
on this accursed hare-brained adventure why oh why
had i not obeyed the impulse to remain in my own time 
but then-i had seen that time machine appear suddenly
out of the sky back in the year  so it seemed that i
was going to return yet-was i perhaps my eyes
had played me false perhaps it was not my time machine
at all that i had seen but an ordinary airplane emerging
from some wisp of mist that had at first rendered it so
indistinct or perhaps some scientist of my own age had
invented a device whereby to produce invisibility and
attaching his machine to an airplane had rendered the
craft invisible what i had taken to be my time machine
had probably really been this machine coming out of its
state of invisibility or possibly it had been my time
machine which i had seen but with the last man at the
controls instead of me

  no matter which of these possibilities was the true one
the fact remained that my deplorable position was in
nowise remedied by this fruitless conjecture the only
thing for me to do in this sad situation was to make it as
bearable as i might

  utterly crushed and despondent i wandered long
through the empty cracked stone avenues of kur my
footfalls ringing hollowly-mockingly-as i stumbled
blindly along my purposeless route

  thus it was by pure accident that i meandered into an
immense tottering structure that reared ponderous and
imposing majestic in all its decaying splendor half a
mile or so from the spot where on the previous evening
my time machine had landed from the various features
that were in evidence as i entered the enormous circular
lobby of the building it was ostensibly some sort of ex-
hibition palace or museum orderly rows of large glass
cases stretched away from the central lobby covered with
the gray dust of numberless millenniums and filled with
strange and interesting relics of the last civilization
to a small extent these wonderful displays served to
assuage the despair that gripped me but though i at-
tempted to interest myself in the strange silent machines
that filled the glass cases of the nearest row i was unable
to discover anything of their purpose since their con-
struction was beyond me and i could not read the odd
characters of the printed placards posted in the cases

  slowly i moved along the row of glass cases many of
which were in a serious stage of disrepair with their
fragments of glass and other debris littering the floor
before them stirred up by my feet the impalpable dust
of long-dead centuries rose in a thick choking cloud

swirling lazily in the air and sinking down again to the
floor when i who had so rudely interrupted its age-long
peace had passed

  when i came to the last great case in the row not far
from a rotting archway that opened upon a capacious
stone court i checked my progress to stare first in mo-
mentary interest then in incredulous astonishment and
finally in doubting puzzlement at the single exhibit that
reposed within the glass-sided case

  could it really be- no-no that was impos-
sible ridiculous absurd but still- frowning
i glared at the thing in the box-silent motionless dust-
covered and braced with metal bands to prevent it from
falling apart-but despite my incredulity i saw that it
was really what i thought it to be there was my own
time machine the very plane with which i had come
to this far-off age-the very machine that had spanned
a million years of time-the very machine with which
the last man had vanished into the fourth dimension
not more than an hour before

  so dumbfounded did the cognizance of this truth leave
me that i suddenly sat right down in the inch-thick dust
that carpeted the floor blinking with unseeing eyes at the
silent machine in the case

  how in the name of all that was holy did that time
machine get there through what queer freak of time
had it returned to  ad when i had seen it
vanish into thin air but an hour earlier for five long
minutes my very amazement kept me from grasping the
obvious truth but at last i saw light of course-that
was how it worked

  when the brown-skinned last man had clambered into
the plane that morning after familiarizing himself with
its controls he had flown back to the year  ad
just as the history books written at that time had taught
him he would there evidently he had ended his days
and the time machine for some reason or other had been
placed in this museum to be found by its own builder
half a million years later

  of course that elucidated the entire affair but my
mind whirled as it grappled with the new paradoxes that
attended this explanation it meant that during the pre-
ceding night the same time machine had been in two dif-
ferent places simultaneously at the one spot it had been
in a new spick-and-span condition while in the other
place half a mile distant it had been a machine so in-
credibly ancient that only the metal bands around it
served to hold it together this archaic machine had
been standing in this case for countless centuries all
during the time that the last man had awaited my arrival
out of the past that he might appropriate my machine
that very same instrument of escape from his eon had
been standing quietly in its case only half a mile away
it had been waiting there before it arrived there yet it
could not have waited there if it had not arrived there
first what would have occurred i wondered if the
last man had returned to  ad with the machine
that already stood there in that case but he couldnt
have done that for then he would have been taking the
time machine out of its location long before it arrived at
that location and i after arriving in  would
have returned to  with the original new machine
so i could not have left it in  that it might go
back to  ad where it could be put into a museum
case for the last man to find my brain reeled groggily
at this tangle of contradicting facts and common sense


amazing stories

  at length a doubt crept into my mind among my mus-
ings would this old decrepit time machine so long out
of use operate

  i rose and kicked at the glass wall of the case shatter-
ing it into a thousand fragments then i stepped into
the case and carefully examined the plane and the time
machine the first glance into the cabin assured me that
it was indeed my own machine for engraved upon the
metal-work within the cabin i found my own name and
the serial number i personally had put there

  beyond a few necessary minor readjustments nothing
appeared amiss with either plane or time machine save
that both were fearfully dry and in need of oil there-
fore breaking out one entire wall of the exhibition case
that the machine might pass through i rolled it out of
the case and upon the stone courtyard outside returning
then to the museum i searched about for three long
hours until in hermetically sealed cans i found oil and
gasoline water grease and alcohol these containers i
opened with the tools that i found still in their proper
place in the time machine it took me nearly the whole
afternoon to get the motor of the plane and the time
machine into working order but at last the task was
done clambering into the cabin i started the tvvo motors

and was soon skimming across the stone courtyard of
the museum presently rising and spiraling upward into
the blue firmament the plane was in anything but per-
fect condition but it satisfied its purpose

  when i was a hundred yards above the paved square i
manipulated the controls of the time machine until in a
minute only a misty blur showed beneath me

  soon the decreasing numbers of the meters warned me
that i was coming close to  ad so i commenced to
decelerate my backward flight along the fourth dimen-
sion more and more until at last when my instruments
registered zero i stopped altogether and began to glide
down to the welcoming field behind my home as i
descended i looked into the sky ahead of me there i
saw a plane spiraling upward into the heavens-my plane
with my time machine attached to it a moment it swung
around became a blur in the blue heavens and was gone
-into the future-to the year  ad-upon the
weird paradoxical voyage from which i had just re-
turned 

  paradoxical  my dear fellow the einstein theory is
full of apparent paradoxes yet to him who understands
it there is no inconsistency whatever give me another
cigarette will you frank

bone pegs and drill miss hinton please ah they
fitted perfectly and now some plain catgut suture-it
will be completely absorbed by the body in a week or so
-to sew the periostium together yes this will promote
the rapid union of the bones some more fine silk
for the nerves miss hinton we shall take the radial
nerve first and now to the median we must be very
careful about it also as it is one of the chief nerve sup-
plies of the forearm and hand no the silk suture will
not be absorbed but it is so small as to cause very little
trouble if carefully used only a few nerves left now
-ah we have finished with them the muscles are go-
ing to be easy there nothing is left but the skin we
will use clips on that miss hinton they leave less dis-
figurement than silk skin sutures

  the clips were nothing more than small strips of metal
half an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide with
a sharp projection at either end they were fastened in
the skin by bending with a pair of metal tweezers and
held the cut edges together in much the same manner
that similar types of paper clips hold sheets of paper
together

  dr aquino i think you had better apply a cast i
am sorry i cannot remiain to assist you but i have an
appointment for a consultation at eleven oclock and
dr evans took his departure

  the cast was applied and as van puyster was taken
to the surgical ward of the hospital the negro still under

case report of patient no 

by dr j roy hopkins

at the september meeting of the shelby county
psychiatric association i gave a preliminary
report of a case which i believe to be unique in the
annals of modern psychiatry as that report was made
over eight months ago i wish to present here a more
detailed account of the case with its recent develop-
ments and for the benefit of those of you who were not
in attendance at that meeting or may have forgotten
some of the details i will consider the case from the
time the patient was admitted to the psychopathic
hospital

  history h v p a native born american of dutch
and english ancestry age  unmarried white male
was admitted to the receiving ward of the psychopathic
hospital july   he was committed to this in-
stitution by judge lynch of the sixth judicial district
as the jury had found him insane when on trial for a
series of homicides of negroes he came from a first
family his early life was normal with the exception
of a rather violent temper in his youth he took up
art and was rapidly on the road to fame when an acci-
dent deprived him of his right arm he fortunately
or it may have been unfortunate retained the late dr
evans who performed upon him the worlds first arm-

grafting operation it may be well to note here that
the arm was taken from a condemned negro criminal
in a few years the patient was painting more marvelous
pictures than ever but some of them bordered on the
fantastic at this time his friends began to notice
that his conduct was slowly being altered he dis-
charged the negro valet who had been his faithful ser-
vant since childhood he would cross the street to
avoid passing a negro and even at the mention of one
it could be noticed that his face grew tense and sullen
about this time he had a series of engagements with
some very charming young ladies but each one was
abruptly terminated after this he was seldom seen in
society and his paintings grew more grotesque than ever

  it was during this period that he started going out
during the night and on several occasions he was
known to have stayed away from home for as many
as three days at a time and to have returned at the end
of that period with his clothes mud-spattered and torn
and in an altogether disreputable state his man also
noticed that these events corresponded with a series
of brutal murders it was after one such event when
the master returned with blood on his clothes that the
new valet made his report to the chief of police the
artist being questioned readily admitted his guilt and
made such statements before the jury as caused them
to render the unanimous verdict of insanity

  when the patient was first seen he was nervous and
irritable and had a habit of opening and clenching his
right hand which was gloved he appeared poorly
nourished and his face conveyed the impression of one
who was constantly besieged by hallucinations other
than this he seemed to be an average man his clinical
picture presented nothing of interest and will not be
discussed here

  when the negro porter brought him his baggage
there was another near homicide committed and but for
the immediate intervention of several white attendants
the assault would probably have terminated fatally

  his condition grew rapidly worse and the hallucina-
tions increased in distinctness and duration frequently
occurring in the day time one of his commonest fan-
cies was that he was being pursued by a negro who was
attempting to cut off his arm this type of aberration
is very typical of his kind of insanity he grew more
morose and solitary and under no conditions would he
permit an attendant to remove his glove

  in view of the preceding facts a diagnosis of para-
noia was made and at this time it was suggested that
his right arm again be amputated this time above the
region of the graft however before this was accom-
plished he was found dead in his cell having bled to
death from a self-inflicted wound which had severed his
right radial artery

  summary a patient with a negative psychiatric his-
tory became criminally insane following a graft of a
negros arm although the operation was a physical and
physiological success from this we may conclude that
it is advisable for a surgeon to consider the mental as
well as physical aspects of any such similar operation

drums of tapajos

by capt s p meek u s a

 author of futility the last war etc

what went before

mariston duncan and nankivell all of the united states
infantry have their doubts as to the advisability of settling
quietly down to normal life now that they arc about to be
released after the war willis a veteran revolution man wherever
the chances seemed to be most promising is called in by mariston
an old friend of his and is told by nankivell backed by the rest of
the boys that he will finance an exciting revolution anywhere if
willis is willing to lead them

  willis however has had enough of revolutions to last him a while
and suggests something entirely new in the way of excitement

  on one of his return trips from an unexplored region in the in-
terior of brazil willis found a man in his death throes who very
incoherently related a story and offered a map to substantiate it
also ho gave willis a mysterious knife which apparently came
from this wilderness in central para according to willis an ex-
pedition into that country would furnish plenty of excitement and
also might prove exceedingly lucrative to all of them

  after several days deliberation the four men set out on their new
adventure they arrive in due time in the outskirts of the tierra

frohibitiva where they find it almost impossible to get enough
radians to go with them they finally do get because of the mens
friendship with the master the services of pedro who had gone more
deeply into the wilderness than any of the other natives and returned
-though not to tell of it more indians were willing to go with
pedro

  nankivell during this trip saves the life of pedro from a water
reptile in return pedro forfeits his life by telling the men his
story of the interior in an effort to make these men give up this
mjd adventure

  they continue however and soon enter the unknown gateway
with its corresponding dangers of flying arrows and jungle terrors
by this time they have learned the truth of much of pedros story
but the most dangerous signal is the sound that later becomes known
to them as the drums of tapajos for this generally heralds at
least one death they have lost all but pedro and two other indians
of all the men they started out with when they get off the boats
and start afoot they learn that the poisoned arrow shots that had
taken toll of some of their indians are now used for the purpose of
guiding the travelers following the directions of the arrows they
soon come to an enormous door which opens quietly while they are
wondering what to do and nahum the warder of the outer gate
of the crypt appears the five strangers follow nahum through
the gate and are made comfortable

  after a sumptuous repast and a rest the visitors are taken
before the master and the council for examination as to their re-
liability and fitness for remaining among these strange people they
come through the examination with flying colors and are taken to
the city of troyana where they meet nahums granddaughter estha
and his nieces balkis and adah the adventurers are initiated into
all the wonders and secrets of the government with one exception-
the crypt remained a secret even to the highest among them and
only the guardians of the crypt knew about it our travelers are
permitted a view of the guardian of the jungle a saurian and
through pedro they soon learn of an incipient revolution it is
during the groat ceremony of the year-the adoration of the
golden calf that the excitement starts

part iii

chapter xvii

the adoration of the golden calf

it was a great relief to leave that place of horror
and to return again to the beautiful regions of
the blue city the luxury and high degree of
civilization that existed there formed a strange
contrast to the barbarism and state of near-slavery
that we had just witnessed i expressed as much to
nahum

  brother duncan he replied i can appreciate your
feelings very fully for at times i have felt as you now
feel it is even now a matter of great grief to me and
to most of the brethren of the blue degree that such a
state of affairs must exist many attempts have been
made in the past to alleviate the condition of the bearers

of burdens but they have been abortive as a race
they do not have the adaptability mental capacity or
moral integrity that is essential to the preservationof a
high degree of civilization

  in the past they have been allowed to increase their
numbers and to live in a state of independence much
greater than they now enjoy but each time that this is
done they have tried to presume upon their privileges
before they were able to enjoy them and twice in our
history they have threatened the entire downfall of our
civilization and the loss of our entire store of accumu-
lated knowledge only by the use of brute force have
they been subdued

  these times were before my birth and i have only
our written records to judge by but what i have told
you i have gained by close and careful study it is
our hope eventually by selective breeding to improve
rtlnce time immemorial man needed some object
aj thought or being to pin his faith to in order to carry
on constructively and in the final analysis it doesnt
matter so much whether the fanatic zvorships the
supreme being zve call god a buddha a golden calf or
science the relative result is equal it is a fascinating
study this subject of religion-no less interesting be-
cause the story is laid in the wilds of brazil there is
excitement and thrills aplenty in this final instalment

i looked at the stage and
saw the cause of his per-
turbation 

their mentality and consequently their condition but
such a process is slow and to attempt to hasten it would
prove disastrous i will take great pleasure in showing
you our records at a later time so that you may judge
for yourself tonight at the ceremony you may get
some insight into their degradation and blood-thirstiness
which may tend to somewhat alter your present natural
feeling of sympathy for them

  we reentered the garden by the door through which
we had quitted it but there was no one to meet us nan-
kivell looked disappointed and nahum smiled broadly

  brother nankivell he said estha asked me to
tender her regrets that she will not be able to be at
supper with us tonight but she is busy with preparations
for the evenings ceremony in which she plays a leading
part my nieces are among her assistants and they will
also have to be excused in your rooms you will find
certain ceremonial robes which i ask that you wear i
regret brother mariston that your robes are incomplete

but your ignorance of the part
which you would be expected to
play leads me to think it better
that you do not wear the emblems
of your past grandeur i have
given orders that your evening re-
freshment be served in your
rooms kindly join me in an hour
our ceremonial robes which
we donned after our repast proved
to be gorgeous affairs they were solid blue in color
and were heavy with silver embroidery depicting many
familiar emblems together with some which we did not
recognize

  pistols bob asked willis

  i hardly think so said willis i had no chance to
speak to nahum about them and it isnt usually done
you know we dont want to give offense

  nankivell and i agreed with him and weaponless we
proceeded downstairs to meet nahum but his first ques-
tion told us that we had guessed wrong

  you have your automatics of course he said as
we approached

  mariston told him of our discussion and decision

  i appreciate your courtesy he replied but this
is a time when they may well be worn you will ob-
serve

  he drew aside his robe and showed us three short
thick tubes depending from a belt worn under it




amazing stories

  these are the nearest thing to pistols that we have
in troyana he said they are electrical in nature and
contain a charge of static electricity held imprisoned at
a potential of four million volts unfortunately they
can give but one discharge and then they are useless
hence we carry many of them some day soon i will
borrow one of your pistols and have our mechanics copy
it meanwhile i would advise you to return and arm
yourselves

  he explained further when we returned armed

  it has been over a thousand years since internal dis-
sension has threatened troyana he said but if it
ever comes again it will come on this particular night in
preference to all others on this night all of the burden
bearers are assembled together with only a portion of
the craftsmen and planners the black robes will out-
number the higher degrees by more than five to one
consequently we always go armed if the burden
bearers were to try to revolt ordinarily we could subdue
them in a few minutes by shutting off the air compres-
sors and consequently their ventilation but tonight they
will be gathered in the room with us and this method
would not be applicable this is the one great holiday
of the year for them

  if trouble developed would miss estha be in any
danger asked nankivell

  no i think not replied nahum but even if she
were there is nothing that i could do she is the high
priestess of the calf and she takes the central part in the
ceremony of the adoration i also have a part in the
ceremony which will prevent me from being with you
but i will put you in charge of some one who will ex-
plain it to you

  we entered the underground auditorium and i paused
in amazement at the size of it one end was taken
up by a broad stage before which hung a golden curtain
on the floor directly before the curtain was a section
of seats capable of holding about three thousand persons
as well as i could judge this was already filled when
we came in with men and women attired in yellow robes
marked with white embroidery on each side of this
section arranged somewhat like the boxes in a theatre
was a smaller section in which were seated wearers of
the blue a railing divided these sections from the
balance of the room which constituted the main area
it would seat at least twenty-five thousand persons i
am sure tier on tier the seats rose until they seemed
endless and it was solidly filled with men women and
children attired in severely plain black robes between
the black section and the sections where sat the higher
degrees stood a line of guards some indian and some
craftsmen officered by blue-clad planners a colorful
splash of color was made by a group of about fifty per-
sons nearly all women and children who wore robes
of a brilliant crimson heavily embroidered with gold

the whole assembly was strangely silent while
those near us sat in more or less relaxed attitudes
the tension that pervaded the black section could be
plainly felt it was evident in the strained attitudes and
the thousands of intently gazing eyes

  nahum led us to seats in the blue section and left us
for a moment returning with the planner whom we
had met in the generator room that afternoon

  brother habbakuk has no part in the ceremonies
that follow he said and i have asked him to sit here
by you and translate for your benefit as the ceremonies

will be in hebrew and atlantean with neither of which
you are conversant

  habbakuk greeted us courteously and nahum de-
parted for the regions behind the golden curtain

  are you armed was his first question

  we assured him that we were and he smiled in a
rather shamefaced manner

  this is the first time that i have worn the blue at
an adoration and i am perhaps unduly nervous he
said at any rate it will do you no harm to learn what
to do should anything happen do you see that door-
way to the left of the curtain that leads into a corri-
dor on each side of which are elevators that lead into
the sanctuary they are of large capacity and are so
arranged that raising one car automatically lowers an-
other if you should have to take to them enter with-
out fear close the door and ascend at full speed your
action in leaving will in itself open another car for
more persons now i will tell you something of what
you are to see

  as he paused a deep sonorous voice sounded from
the air before us and he hastily motioned us to silence
i looked around for the source of the voice but could
not for a moment find it i looked inquiringly at hab-
bakuk who pointed toward the stage before the cur-
tain stood zephaniah his arms outspread and his face
raised speaking he could not have been speaking
loudly but his voice seemed to fill the air and to come
from all directions at once it was evident that he had
some sort of a microphonic transmitter before him
which was amplifying his voice so that it filled the huge
ampitheater

  the opening prayer to the god of fire whose son
the calf is whispered habbakuk

  the effect of the rich sonorous voice rolling out its
majectic hebraic periods in the otherwise deathly silence
was impressive to the highest degree as zephaniah
talked the lights grew gradually dim and my attention
was drawn to a brilliant point of light above his head
which seemed to grow brighter and more intense and to
expand until its radiance filled the whole amphitheater
his voice rolled on and on and it seemed to me that i
was floating in the air and i was filled with a nameless
feeling of ecstasy larger and larger grew the light
until it seemed to be pervading my entire being and i
floated on waves of majestic sound buoyed up with the

radiance of light lighter and lighter i grew-

  habbakuk pinched me sharply and i came to earth
with a crash he gave the same treatment to mariston
and motioned me to arouse willis and nankivell each
of them had his eyes focussed on the point of light above
zephaniahs head and an expression of rapture was on
nankivells face willis was grinning like a satyr i
pinched each of them sharply and they shook their heads
and looked around nankivell started to speak but i
motioned him to silence and looked at habbakuk he
glanced at the light and then looked meaningly away i
understood his motion and seized nankivell by the ear
and forcibly turned his head away for perhaps five
minutes longer zephaniahs voice rolled on and then died
away into quiet habbakuk shook his head sharply

  hypnotism he whispered i forgot to tell you not
to look at the light

  as zephaniahs voice died away i ventured to look
again at the light and saw that it was coming through the
golden curtain for a moment there was silence and
then a sweet wailing as of wood-winds and stringed in-
the drums of tapajos



struments pervaded the air louder and louder it grew
and a note of barbarous sensuality crept into it the
curtain shivered slightly and i saw that it was slowly
dissolving into nothingness before my gaze and an in-
distinct image was-gradually taking form behind it it
was from a point on this image that the single light
which now illuminated the entire building shone

  more and more transparent grew the curtain and pres-
ently it disappeared and the image stood plain before us
it was that of a calf monstrous and satanic eight or
nine feet high at the shoulder and constructed apparently
of massive gold strings of sparkling gems surrounded
its misshapen neck and the eyes were huge red stones
glowing with an internal fire of their own from a spot
on the forehead emanated the intensely brilliant light
which had shone through the curtain

  the air of sensuality pervading the music became
more pronounced and a slight stir went through the
audience the music rose to a crescendo of barbaric
passion and before the image appeared a figure ap-
parently materializing from thin air i gasped and
looked again from the corner of my eye i saw that
nankivell was shaking his head and rubbing his eyes in
a dazed manner no wonder-for the figure before us
was that of estha but not the estha we thought we
knew gone was the girlishness and graceful dignity
of her bearing and gone were the graceful robes in
which we had seen her her long black hair was
powdered with gold and hung free from a fillet which
sparkled and scintillated with the fire of a thousand
gems showers of glittering points of light which could
only have been diamonds hung pendant from each side
of the fillet flowing over her perfectly molded shoulders
and caught in a bunch before her for the rest she wore
a girdle of jewels over her hips from which depended
strings of gems half way to her feet and jeweled anklets

  nankivell whistled softly between his teeth as he gazed
on the vision of loveliness before him and i didnt blame
him much i had realized that estha was a beautiful girl
and a superb specimen of womanhood but i had not
before realized the absolute perfection of her proportions
for a moment she poised there and then as the music
grew more sensuous and languorous she danced

  softly at first she began but more and more fire crept
into her movements until she seemed a wreathing mass
of points of fire and represented the very spirit of pas-
sion faster and higher the notes of the music rose
keeping pace with the fury of the dance suddenly it
stopped on a discordant note that crashed out out of
harmony with the rest of it and we came to with a
start then began the strains of a bacchanale which
could well have been played in the temples of ashtoreth
in the height of the infamy of babylon that harlot
among cities from the darkness beside estha material-
ized other shapes clad in diaphanous draperies among
the group of girls i recognized both adah and balkis
and i heard maristons breath hiss out sharply
they joined estha in a mad riot of motion that
surpassed anything that i had seen even in dreams
faster and more furious grew the dance and then again
came a discordant crash and the dancers froze into im-
mobility on their knees their arms upstretched in sup-
plication to the horrible image above them

the music started again but this time the strains
held a note of cruelty and blood-thirstiness slowly
the dancers moved aside leaving estha alone before the

image and slowly as though fascinated she approached
it and mounted the steps of the pedestal on which it
stood as she advanced with a langorous and feline
grace that seemed to suggest blood and torture i saw
that she held in her hand a naked dagger whose blade
glistened in the light nahum came slowly into view
before the image of the calf and in his hands he held a
naked infant forward estha glided her entire attitude
suggestive of cruelty and a desire for blood nahum
handed her the child and she took it in her arms and
raised it ceremonfously before the image and then low-
ered it again three times she raised and lowered it and
it seemed to me that that accursed image nodded when
this happened estha laid the child on the platform be-
fore the monster and raising her knife she brought it
slowly down

  my god exclaimed mariston hoarsely and strug-
gled to his feet drawing his automatic as he did so

  down sit down exclaimed habbakuk

  nankivell was also on his feet and i must have risen
although i have no recollection of moving for i found
myself standing with drawn pistol when iiabbakuk
shook me i glanced down at him

  its not a child its a dummy he muttered hoarsely

  what  i asked in a dazed manner

  its a dummy dont let that fool fire

  i grasped nankivell by the arms and dragged him for-
cibly into his seat while habbakuk did the same to
mariston nankivell tried to struggle but i twisted his
gun from his grasp and turned my attention to willis
i was too late i struck his arm up just as his gun went
off with an ear-shattering roar and his bullet struck the
image with the sound of the gun a haze seemed to
clear from my eyes and i saw plainly that what i had
thought was a human child was merely a bundle of some
inert material wrapped in white i saw mariston rub-
bing his eyes

  the sound of the shot was followed by silence for a
moment and then a voice arose from the black section
it rose alone frightfully distinct in the profound hush
and then arose a roar i had never heard it before but i
knew it for the blood cry of an angry mob from the
black section came a wave of humanity rolling toward
us the line of yellow-clad guards sprang forward
brandishing tubes such as i had seen hung to nahums
belt but the mob was beyond fear forward they
surged sweeping over the thin line of cowans and
craftsmen and then came a blinding flash and the air
was filled with the flash and crash of high tension elec-
trical discharges

  by dozens and by hundreds the oncoming burden
bearers fell before the flash of guns of the craftsmen
and planners but where one fell a dozen took his
place

  to the sanctuary shouted habbakuk in my ear and
turned toward the door he had pointed out earlier in the
evening i turned to follow but nankivell was no longer
by my side i turned to look for him and saw him
half a dozen tier of seats below me fighting his way
toward the stage mariston at his heels there was
nothing else to do so i took out after him as fast as i
could go

  dont shoot dune shouted willis in my ear we
may need every round for close quarters

  frank i shouted as i reached him youre headed
the wrong way come back

  he shook himself free from my restraining hand and


amazing stories

pointed toward the stage as he fought his way forward

  estha he shouted back over his shoulder she is
cut off weve got to get to her

  i looked at the stage and saw the cause of his per-
turbation estha stood alone before the image and al-
ready the oncoming black wave was between her and her
line of retreat forward we made our way blinded
by the flashes and deafened by the roar of the electrical
discharges we reached the stage but to our dismay
it was ten feet above our heads and the smooth polished
surface offered no handhold we were stopped for a
moment but mariston sprang forward and put his back
to the wall

  up with you frank he cried

  nankivell ran forward and stepped in maristons
cupped hands mariston gave a tremendous upward
heave and nankivell jumped and between their efforts
he rose high enough to get a grip on the stage above him
i hastily put my shoulder under his foot and in a mo-
ment he was lost to view

  catch hold of me dune ray next said mariston

  i stepped beside him and between us we hoisted willis
to the stage in a moment he was on his stomach lean-
ing over to grasp my hand and i joined him i dropped
prone beside him and we caught maristons hands and
hoisted him just in time td escape having his ankles
grasped by the first of our pursuers we dragged him
up and i arose and looked around the stage was empty

  where is frank i cried

  this way cried mariston i saw him go behind
here

  i followed him but willis was an old fighter and he
stayed behind for a moment long enough to shoot the
first two of our pursuers who gained the platform thus
giving us a moment of respite mariston and i rounded
the platform on which the image stood and before us
we saw an open doorway into the darkness we plunged
followed closely by willis as we did so a flash of
orange light stabbed the darkness and a bullet whistled
past my ear

  frank cried mariston as i was about to return the
fire

  bob came a welcome answering voice and in a
moment we were beside him

  where are we asked willis

  i dont know he replied just as i gained the
platform i saw a figure that i am sure was estha dis-
appear behind the idol and i followed

  dune you know how to shut that door dont you
asked willis

  i think so i answered

  then shut it and keep those hellhounds out he
ordered

  have you a match i asked

  mariston lighted one and i hastily looked for one
of the concealed emergency levers which nahum had
shown me that morning fortunately i found it and
the door rose with a crash just in front of our pursuers
leaving us in total darkness

  now what asked mariston

  go ahead said nankivell eagerly estha went this
way

  if she did shes probably safe in the sanctuary by
now i replied she knows the roads here we
should have thought of that and made our own escape
while we could she probably stood there as a decoy
to draw the attack and enable the rest of us to get into

the elevators while she had her own way of escape open
all the time

  thats probably true said mariston but all the
same i dont blame frank at all if it had been balkis
instead of estha i expect that i would have led the way
the question now is which way shall we go 

  theres only one way replied willis and that is
straight ahead we cant go back and one way forward
is as good as another it will be just a matter of luck
where we land anyway my sense of direction is no good
underground

  the truth of his statement was too self-evident to
merit discussion and we assented to his program

  let nankivell lead the way directed willis he
might possibly hit something ahead of him but after
that shot he made when we entered i dont care to have
him behind me if any shooting starts

  righto old top laughed nankivell still you
had better be glad that i cant shoot if i could our
number would be one less right now come on boys
forward march and devil take the hindmost

  with pistols drawn and ready we followed him into
the darkness

chapter xviii

pedro pays his debt

i have no very clear idea as to the distance that we
walked before we encountered an obstacle it
could not have been very far but in the darkness
and absolute quiet through which we moved it seemed
interminable my nerves were getting more jumpy every
minute and i expect that i sprang three feet when
there was a crash before us followed by nankivells voice
raised in a howl of pain

what is it frank asked mariston anxiously

 --- exclaimed nankivell luridly ive

come to the end of this benighted passage and i ram-
med my head into a stone wall

  oh is that all  replied mariston in a relieved voice
i thought it was something serious

  its serious enough to suit me retorted nankivell
have you any more matches

  no i used the only one i had when dune closed the
door he replied who has some

  i have two i said after i had searched the pocket
of my pistol belt

  only two cried willis hasnt any one else any
  a silence answered his query

  well have to save them then he remarked dune
you know more about these doors than the rest of us
do see if you can find the button

  i searched by the sense of touch unavailingly

  well have to use one of our matches then said
willis when i reported my inability to find the lever in
the darkness bob you light it and let dune stand by
to get the best advantage from it

  the light flared up and i searched frantically for
some sign of a lever which would open the way before
us not a thing could i find and the match flared up
and died

  it may be a door that will open only at a vocal com-
mand i ventured nahum told me that there were
some without emergency levers at places where burden
bearers were commonly employed

this may be one of them assented willis well
the drums

of tapajos



the best thing for us to do so far as i can see is to go
back the way we came we had better separate and go
two to a side in that way we may find an intersecting
passage that will lead us somewhere

  how far is it back to where we entered asked
mariston

  there was a moment of silence

  darned if i know bob said willis at length i
ought to have known enough to keep track of the num-
ber of steps but i forgot it at any rate we know one
thing it is straight behind us

  i doubt that i replied in this darkness there is
little chance that we wouldnt swing off to one side i
rather think that we will find that the passage has curved
to the left

  all the more reason for keeping in touch with the
walls he said you come with me frank and let
dune go with bob

  as we started back i took the lead my hand on the
wall beside me and carefully counting my footsteps i
had gone one hundred and ninety-seven before the wall
suddenly ended simultaneously willis spoke and an-
nounced a similar discovery from the other wall

  evidently we have hit a right-angle intersecting pas-
sage he said the question now is which way shall
we go

  i think that nahums house lies to our left i said
my sense of direction is no good underground in the
dark he replied even if you are right i dont think
we want to go back there judging from such of the
scrap as i saw nahum and his friends are either in the
sanctuary or they have gone west the place we want
to find is the sanctuary and that should be almost di-
rectly above us lets take the left for our way at a
venture until we hit another passage or a door well
split and go each side and keep track of our steps as we
have been doing

  we changed direction and continued on our way we
had gone two hundred and sixty-two paces when we
were stopped by a stone wall

  what the devil  exclaimed mariston what do you
make of this ray

  there was no answer he called again and still no
answer came to us we turned and retraced our steps
but we found no intersecting passage again we called
but only silence answered us

  we must have turned off on a diverging passage
said mariston these darned sandals dont make
enough sound on a rubber pavement to be heard a foot
away take the left wall dune and ill take the right
but speak every five paces so we wont get separated

  in this manner we started but after fifty paces we
found that our voices were suddenly muffled and we
stopped and investigated sure enough the corridor
branched off into two directions at a small angle

  damn exclaimed mariston come over to me
and take the left side of the corridor i am on you are
evidently on the one we followed before

  again we resumed our advance but within eighty
paces the passage branched again we stopped in dis-
may

  ray frank shouted mariston throwing caution
to the winds

we strained our ears and it seemed that we caught
a faint reply mariston called again and this time
we were sure that we heard an answer but it seemed

to come from behind us we turned and retraced our
steps halloing from time to time the answers drew
nearer for a time and then started to grow fainter and in
a few minutes came from behind us again

  either we are completely turned around or else we
are in a perfect maze said mariston turn around
dune we might as well try to follow the sound

  we shouted again and an answer came faintly to us
we strove to follow it but it rapidly grew fainter and
we paused

the only thing for us to do is to stand still and shout
bob i suggested they are moving as well as we are
and that is probably why we are missing each other
youre probably right he replied well stand
right here and shout at intervals

  we did so and to our relief the answering voices came
nearer once or twice they started to get fainter but
their average distance was steadily lessened and suddenly
they sounded almost at our sides in a few moments
willis and nankivell joined us

  now where mariston asked after we had com-
pared notes and found that the experiences of willis and
nankivell had been identical with ours

  frankly i havent an idea replied willis i had
a fair idea of about where we were when we started
but i am completely lost now we may be moving
straight back toward the ampitheater for all that i
know it may be just around the next corner

  none of us had any idea of our location so we set for-
ward at random two on each side as before but keeping
vocal contact it was well that we did so for in a few
moments it became evident that we were in a perfect
maze of passages and might very easily be going in a
circle for over an hour we kept up our round of
marching and paused at last when we ran into a door
marking the end of the passage we had been following
to say that we were tired would be putting it very
mildly when a person has been used to walking with
heeled boots all of his life heelless sandals even on a
rubber flooring will wear him out in a short time

  ill be damned if i know what to do bob said
willis despondently i was never more thoroughly lost
in my life good lord look at that back back and
draw pistols

  that was a narrow line of light on the roof before
us as we watched the crack grew wider and it was
apparent that the door ahead of us was slowly lowering
down it slipped until it had opened a space of about two
feet and then the motion ceased we watched it without
moving for a minute and then nankivell stole silently
forward the rest of us followed at his heels

  we reached the door the top of which was about
three feet above our heads and paused listening

  a murmur of voices came from the other side of the
barrier something about one of the voices seemed quite
familiar and we strained our ears suddenly nankivell
gave a shout

  pedro he called

  seiior frank came the answer from the other side
of the door in what was quite evidently pedros voice

  open the door pedro called willis we are
alone

  senor ray said pedro it will not open more can
you get over it

  easy said nankivell get your back to it bob
wait a minute frank interposed willis this may
be a trap


amazing stories

  trap nothing cried nankivell id trust pedro
anywhere

  so would i but it is possible that he is a prisoner and
is speaking under duress objected willis

  not pedro replied nankivell at any rate id
just as soon be bumped off in a hurry as starve to death
in this damned dungeon im going over

  mariston placed his back to the wall and aided by
the rest of us frank scrambled up upon the door which
like most of the troyana doors proved to be about eight
feet thick he crawled forward and looked over the
farther edge and then crawled back

  come on fellows he said its pedro all right and
lies alone

  in a few moments we were beside him and together
we crawled to the far edge and dropped down pedro
fell on his knees and tried to kiss nankivells hand but
nankivell forstalled him and insisted on shaking hands
to pedros embarrassment

  how on earth did you find us  mariston asked

  seiior bob although you did not see me i was
among the guards in the big room when the great ma-
gician prayed i had seen medicine men work before
so i shut my eyes and my ears and he had no power over
me then i saw the white goddess dance and pretend
that she was making a sacrifice then i heard seiior
rays gun and then all fought and i tried to join you
i saw you climb up on the place where the god was and
follow the white goddess but i could not get up there
without aid and i was swept away by the others

  the black robes do not hate us of the indian tribes
and none offered to do me harm besides they know
that we all carry poisoned knives and it may be that
they avoid us because they wish to live and not because
they love us when you shut the door in their faces
those who were pursuing you came back and said that
you were in the labyrinth and could never escape and
that they would hunt you down at their leisure

  when i heard these words i took one of the black
robes who seemed to know that of which he spoke and
i drew him to one side and pressed the point of my
poisoned knife against him and bade him to follow me
without crying out when we were away from the
crowd i asked him of another entrance he said that
there was none and i told him that then he must die
then since he saw that i meant what i had said he re-
membered another way into the labyrinth and he led
me to this door and told me that you were somewhere
on the far side of it he did not know how to open the
door so i took him away a distance and killed him

  when i had cleaned my knife i went back to the hall
and brought with me another black robe to this spot he
knew how to open the door and he tried to do so but it
would open only a short distance he said that the
great ones above had so fixed it and that none of the
black robes could do more than he had done so i took
him away a distance and killed him and then came back
thinking how i could get over it i prayed to the great
spirit and to the god of this place in the voice that is
bidden for each when neither answered i made a
powerful medicine and prayed to each of the gods in
turn one phrase to each and each in a different voice so
that they would think that each was being supplicated by
one of his worshipers and aid one another my prayer
was answered for while i was praying i heard your
voice since the gods had answered my prayer i
thanked them and spoke to you that is all

  thats enough cried nankivell that is more
than any one of us could have done you are a real
hero pedro now where shall we go do you know
the road to the sanctuary

  no seiior frank but i know the road to the build-
ings where the indians sleep there my countrymen are
and there not even the black robes would dare to try to
take you

  i guess we had better go there and work from there
as a base said mariston i hope we dont meet any
of them on the way

  i have an idea exclaimed willis pedro where are
those two bodies

  but a short distance away seiior ray

  fine he replied you fellows wait here pedro
come with me

  they were gone for perhaps ten minutes and returned
with four black robes and sandals to match

  put these on directed willis

  where did you get four  i asked

  dont ask questions he retorted pedro still had
his knife and i had my strength and it was their lives
or ours get them on and lets go

  we made short work of doffing our ceremonial blue
robes and donning the black ones and attired as four
burden bearers and one cowan we set forth under
pedros guidance

for perhaps half a mile we pursued our way through
tortuous corridors meeting only a few doors which i
opened without trouble we met no one and we were
beginning to breathe easier when a sound reached our
ears that stopped us in our tracks it was the sound of
voices speaking in atlantean and they were approaching
down a corridor that intersected the one we were in a
few yards ahead we turned to retreat but there was no
cross passage and no door for several hundreds of yards
in our rear and the voices were apparently only a few
yards from the intersection

  as we hesitated with drawn pistols a body of ten
men in black robes came into sight bringing with them a
prisoner we were not seen for a moment and then
their leader looked toward us he called something to
us in atlantean and i responded in a gibberish which i
hoped would deceive him it might have done so had
not his glance fallen on nankivells blond head at
almost the same instant mariston recognized the prisoner
and shouted his name aloud

  zephaniah he cried

  at a word from the leader two of the band hurled the
aged master to the floor and pinioned him while the rest
advanced toward us

  let them come close enough that you wont waste a
shot and then turn loose said willis

  we obeyed his instructions and let the advancing men
approach to within ten yards before we opened fire it
was sheer murder shooting down those unarmed men
but there was no time to hesitate and i downed my two
without a qualm of conscience as the last of the eight
fell we ran forward to release the master

  nankivell and pedro were somewhat in advance and
had almost reached him when i saw something that
made my blood run cold one of his captors was
holding an electric pistol in bis hand and was squinting
along it toward nankivell

  look out frank i shouted but i was too late
there was a blinding flash and an ear-splitting roar and
the drums

of tapajos



for a moment we were blinded as my eyes cleared i
heard the sharp crack of an automatic and saw nankivell
standing unharmed with a smoking pistol in his hand
again the pistol spoke and the second of zephaniahs
captors dropped frank dropped his pistol and bent for-
ward over something on the ground

  i had called to him quickly but i had been too slow
not so pedro however he had seen nankivells peril
as soon as i had and where i had paused to warn him
pedro had acted to save him he had thrown himself
forward and had taken the charge of static electricity
on his own body and had saved his friend

  his whole left arm and shoulder were burned away
this alone had not been enough to absorb the charge but
it had deflected it and it had spent its energy on the stone
wall sadly we looked at the shattered remains of our
faithful friend and guide

  a faithful servant brethren said a deep sonorous
voice at our sides and we saw zephaniah had risen
faithful unto death for such as he there is a greater
reward laid up than for us who wear the blue no matter
how worthily brethren let us kneel and ask that the
great architect make his example to so ennoble us and
to raise in our bosoms such thoughts as will enable us
better to aid our fellow men

  in silence we knelt and the solemn voice of the master
rolled out the stately periods and sounding phrases of
the oldest prayer in the world i have heard many
prayers in my life i have heard a solemn requiem mass
for the soul of a departed pope i have heard a nation
weep for a martyred president but never has a prayer
so moved me as that simple yet solemn prayer offered
eight hundred feet underground for the sake of a poor
savage who had given his all for the master whom he
had made his friend

  when he had finished the prayer zephaniah remained
on his knees for a few moments in silence and then
arose

  my brethren he said thanks to your timely aid
i am still spared to labor for my people others may
be attracted by the sound of your weapons so it be-
hooves us to hasten to the sanctuary we will take with
us the body of your servant in order that it may be
disposed of with fitting ceremonies let us pass on

  nankivell and i raised pedros body and soberly fol-
lowed the master nankivells shoulders shaking with
suppressed sobs as he walked

chapter xix

the sanctuary

we retraced our steps for perhaps a hundred
yards and then zephaniah paused and facing to
his left spoke a few words before us a door
slid slowly down displaying to our gaze the familiar
rows of seats that were characteristic of the conveyances
of troyana we entered and seated ourselves laying
pedros body respectfully on the floor

  how far are we from the sanctuary asked maris-
ton

  we are close to the outer edge of the city replied
zephaniah unfortunately we cannot return by the
most direct route for that leads through the amphitheater
which is held by the burden bearers we will have to
go to a point beyond our destination and double back

we changed conveyances four times before we entered

one which bore us swiftly upward as was shown by the
pressure on our feet presently the elevator stopped
and we were confronted by a row of craftsmen who
raised electric pistols in a threatening manner until
the color of zephaniahs robe became evident to them
and he was recognized with a cry of joy a planner
who was evidently in command of the detachment of
guards hastened forward to greet him

  is all well tubal asked the master

  all is well most worshipful sir replied the plan-
ner many of our rank have perished but many have
also gained the sanctuary and are safe who be these
with you

  do you not recognize our brethren from the outer
world asked the master

  tubal looked at us closely and then hastened to greet
us warmly

  you are welcome my brethren he began ceremoni-
ously but nankivell interrupted him

  is estha safe he demanded

  the grandchild of nahum is safe in the inner court
replied tubal

  thank god exclaimed nankivell

  what is the toll of the brethren  asked zephaniah

  one of the keepers of the treasure eleven wearers
of the crimson two hundred twenty and one of the
planners and eight hundred thirty and four of the
wearers of the yellow most worshipful sir answered
tubal

  are all needful dispositions made 

  they are most worshipful sir

  it is well it is my will and pleasure that all the
brethren of the blue degree gather in the asylum within
the space of two hours that counsel may be taken this
you will proclaim to the brethren that it may accordingly
be so done

  your order shall be obeyed replied tubal with a
deep bow and a familiar sign

  come with me said zephaniah shortly to us and
without words we followed him

  he led the way to a suite of rooms somewhat similar
to those in which we had first taken up our abode in
troyana and sank on a divan exhausted he called out
in hebrew and when a cowan answered he gave an
order the indian bowed and went out to return in a
few minutes with a pitcher of wine and five goblets
zephaniah gulped his eagerly and the rest of us were not
more reluctant zephaniah spoke to the cowan again
in a few minutes two indians entered and raised pedros
body and reverently bore it out

  my brethren said zephaniah kindly you have
doubtless seen much that puzzles you i will be glad
to answer the questions which are doubtless troubling
you

  there is just one thing that puzzles me said nanki-
vell we seemed to see estha prepare to sacrifice a
human child before that hideous monstrosity and then
later we saw that it was only a dummy and then trouble
started what did it all mean

  zephaniah smiled slightly

  doubtless you fixed your eyes on the spot of light
over my head when i began my prayer he asked

  we nodded assent

  that explains your bewilderment he went on my
prayer and the light were designed for one thing alone
to hypnotize such of the audience as were not in the
secret those who were looked another way and


amazing stories

stopped their ears the reason for the ceremony is this
the ancient atlanteans from whom the bearers of
burdens are descended were a barbarous race who prac-
tised human sacrifice temple harlotry and religious can-
nibalism despite six thousand years of attempts to
cducate them we have done little toward improving them
and have suppressed the practises i have named only
by force fortunately we have almost eliminated the
worst of the three for cannibalism is hardly known
even so as recently as two years ago a number of their
children were missed and their bones when found
showed evidence of the horror which had been perpe-
trated

  in order to pacify them and make the problem of
their control easier we contrived some two thousand
years ago the golden calf and the ceremonies with
which it is worshiped at first we were forced to make
actual human sacrifices but about twelve hundred years
ago the master who had an unusually far seeing and
acute mind devised the present ceremony where a
prayer with attendant concentration on a spot of light
is the first step this when properly contrived has the
effect of so hypnotizing the audience that a dummy
sacrifice can be carried out without their detecting the
fraud for over a thousand years no human being
has been sacrificed

  we are always cautious that no extraneous sound in-
terrupts the ceremony and my only explanation of the
events of this evening is that the sound of the shot
which one of you fired broke the spell and enabled
them to detect the fraud this showing them that they
were being cheated of the vicarious pleasure which they
have annually felt in a blood sacrifice enraged them and
brought to a sudden head discontent which has been
brewing for the last thirty years

  then estha knew that it was a dummy said nanki-
vell with an air of great relief

  certainly all wearers of the blue and many of the
more advanced of the craftsmen knew it there

  he was interrupted by the entrance of a blue-clad
messenger who saluted and spoke rapidly zephaniahs
face assumed a look of anxiety and he questioned the
messenger sharply the messenger answered and the
worried look on the masters face deepened suddenly
he spoke in english

  direct brother joel to make all haste possible in
starting the main emergency generator he directed
and have the observation post manned as soon as there
is sufficient power bid them to report at the asylum
within the space of an hour

  the messenger saluted and left zephaniah turned to
us

  i must apologize for forgetting that you cannot speak
the language of troyana he said graciously the
news that was brought me was ill but i beg to be ex-
cused from informing you at present the council will
meet in an hour and all news will be laid before them
in the meantime partake of refreshment and rest

at his call a cowan appeared who led us into another
 room where a meal was served to us and where we
had an opportunity to recline on divans and rest our
weary limbs it seemed that we had barely lain down
when a messenger entered and bade us to the asylum
we rose and followed him through corridors to the room
where we had first been examined again the bowing

files of craftsmen opened before us and we approached
the doorway we had no difficulty in gaining admission
and after the proper ceremonies took our places

  it is my order said zephaniah when all had as-
sembled that the deliberation of this assembly be con-
ducted in english for the benefit of our newly found
brethren this you will proclaim

  the orders were duly repeated and zephaniah turned
to an officer

  brother steward he said report the state of the
stores

  most worshipful sir was the reply the stores are
in excellent condition and are in full quantity for a
period of seventy years for those here assembled

  it is well said the master brother armorer what
is your report

  most worshipful sir replied the officer to whom
the question had been addressed there is an abundance
of charged tubes and all else needful for our proper
defense

  brother scribe said the master declare the num-
ber of the brethren

  of the purple two one present and one imprisoned
in the vault but reported well and safe of the crim-
son  eleven only of the blue two hundred twenty and
seven of the yellow eight hundred thirty and one
of the black there are none here

  the report is a poor one yet better than i had
hoped replied the master brother warder of the
west your report

  it is bad most worshipful sir there has been a
traitor in our midst

  the master bowed his head while a murmur of aston-
ishment ran around the room

  worshipful brother amos who was deposed thirty-
two years ago from the throne which you now occupy
is not in our midst we thought that he had been killed
but he has been located and has joined forces with the
bearers of burdens we cannot see the interior of the
crypt due to its protection but since the air compressors
are already driving air through the underground dwell-
ings it is evident that he has forced the crypt before the
generators could be destroyed and has them in operation
although the crypt is in his possession the vault has
been closed and he has but a small store of energy with
which to feed his generators still with care it may
last him for years especially as the bearers of burdens
will now live above ground and the great energy used in
the air compressors will be saved

  what of the vault asked the master anxiously
the vault is safe brother zerubbabel holds it and
he has lowered the emergency doors so that he is protec-
ted by miles of rock from the crypt there is little
chance for amos to secure more energy when his present
store is exhausted

  that is well said the master brother warder of
the west you yill cjommunicate the state of affairs to

brother zerubbabel and inform him-

  most worshipful sir interrupted the warder be-
fore you order the expenditure of that amount of
energy hear the balance of my report always enough
energy has been stored in the sanctuary storehouses to
meet our anticipated needs for sixty years brother
amos as you know had it in his care he has stolen it
from the sanctuary and there remains only base metal
and enough units of energy to maintain our observation
posts and to supply the ordinary comforts of life for
the drums

of tapajos



five years with great economy if we endeavor to use
the projectors we will exhaust our store in a month
a dead silence greeted this announcement for a mo-
ment and than an undertone of muttered imprecations
against the traitor ran around the hall

  my order is recalled said the master let us take
counsel has any brother anything to offer

  the fruitless discussion which followed lasted for
several hours but no one had a constructive suggestion
to offer the final conclusion reached was that energy
would be conserved in every way possible and that only
a minimum of observation should be used and that the
laboratory would work night and day in an attempt to
find a substitute for the missing material from which
alone atomic energy could be produced so far as the
science of troyana was concerned at length the meet-
ing adjourned with prayer and nahum hastened up to us

  my brethren he exclaimed as he greeted us warmly
we had given both you and the master up for lost
when you appeared and he related how your bravery
and skill had delivered him from the hands of our ene-
mies there is nothing in troyana that is not yours for
the asking zephaniah wished to keep you with him
but my prayers have prevailed and you are to resume
your places as members of my household will you
come with me as soon as you have received the thanks
and felicitations of the brethren my granddaughter
is awaiting your arrival anxiously

  we were dog-tired and we managed to cut short the
congratulations and thanks which were pouring in on
us from every side and accompanied nahum the small
suite of rooms to which he led us contrasted poorly with
the luxurious mansion where we had formerly been
housed but the warmth of the welcome which met us
more than made up for anything that may have been
lacking

  as we entered estha again in the blue robes of her
rank ran forward and threw her arms around nankivell

  frank she half laughed and half sobbed i thought
that you had been killed why were you so foolish as
to try to follow me didnt you realize that i was safe
and knew what i was doing

  i didnt think he said as he drew her closer to him
all i saw was that you were in danger and i jumped
out after you

  silly boy she cried and kissed him i glanced ap-
prehensively at nahum but that old gentleman had dis-
creetly looked the other way

  from another room balkis and adah entered and
thanked us prettily enough for what little we had been
able to do but their thanks had none of the fervor and
warmth of esthas one would think that frank nanki-
vell had done everything

  we sat up most of the night talking to nahum and
we found that the seriousness of the situation had not
been exaggerated energy in the peculiar form that
was adapted to the atomic disintegrators of troyana was
indeed life and death as well as power of offense and
defense to this people it was true that their enemies
had a larger supply and had also one of the best minds
of troyana to supervise its expenditure but due to the
larger number that they had to provide for and our
almost impregnable position in the fortified sanctuary
the situation was really a deadlock if we could do
nothing neither could they

  such was the situation and such it remained the
first few days were interspersed with attempts on our

part or on the part of the cohorts of amos to obtain
an advantage but both were equally unsuccessful as
neither of the two parties was in a position to expend the
energy to try a decisive blow if such a blow were
attempted and failed the attackers would find them-
selves at the mercy of their enemies and the fight soon
developed into a stalemate each side waiting for the
other to make a false move which would leave them at
the mercy of their opponents

zephaniah did not forget his promise about
pedro the day after we reached the sanctuary a
magnificent ceremony was held in the asylum where the
master preached a moving sermon about the virtues of
fidelity he ordered pedros body embalmed and placed
in a mausoleum against the time when it could be re-
moved and interred in the forest from which he had
come it was a touching ceremony and we all broke
down at the masters words nankivell especially crying
like a baby

  three months passed in this fashion willis mariston
and nankivell were assigned to duties connected with
the defense while i was put to work in the laboratory
my puerile knowledge of the science of europe and
america poorly fitted me to aid in the advanced prob-
lems in the constitution of the atom which were being
carried out but i was something of a technician and
was able to be of some small use i hope i did my best
anyway

  our hours of duty differed and i saw comparatively
little of either willis or nankivell i saw mariston
every day and he told me how things were going with
the others willis was getting more and more impatient
for the outside world but nankivell would need a team
of horses to drag him away it seemed he was com-
pletely enslaved by our hosts charming granddaughter
mariston did not think that nahum altogether approved
of the intimacy and had indeed spoken rather sharply
to estha on several occasions and had finally requested
nankivell to cease his attentions i felt that i was
rather more than a friend of the old gentleman and i
foolishly enough took it on myself to remonstrate with
him about his attitude i didnt get far

  brother duncan he said sternly you are a good
and tried brother and so is brother nankivell and to you
both troyana owes a great debt but there are limits
beyond which no one may go no matter how much
brother nankivell and my granddaughter may love one
another nothing can come of it he is of the outside
world and she is of troyana and such a union would re-
sult disastrously already in your hearts you tire of
the place and long for greater freedom should estha
and brother nankivell unite he would be tied here and
in a hundred years or so he would chafe at his bonds
and become miserable longing for the world he has
known and his discontent would kill estha on the
other hand she was born in troyana and could not live
in happiness beyond its halls much as i love you
strangers that one request i cannot grant

  you said beyond the halls of troyana  i said
eagerly do you mean that there is a chance of escape
from here

  he smiled in a wry fashion

  i am right as you can see he replied at the mere
suggestion of a chance to leave this city you are all
agog and yet you are better adapted to troyana than
either brother nankivell or brother willis yes


amazing stories

brother duncan there is a chance but i can say no
more in due time you will learn if it be the masters
will

  i thought that there were no secrets from those of
the blue degree i replied

  none save those pertaining to the crypt he replied
our entire knowledge is not confined to the operation
of a few machines i can say no more

  i told mariston what nahum had said to me and it
made us both think it was therefore less of a sur-
prise than it would otherwise have been when we
were summoned to the asylum one evening to an assem-
bly of which we had not been notified we were told to
stand before the altar

  my brethren said the master it grieves my heart
that you should think of leaving us for i have come to
love you like sons but brother nahum informs me
that your hearts are sore for your homes is it so 
we bowed without speaking

  it grieves me greatly and i would hold you here by
love if i could but i will not hold you here by force
there is a way to return you from here to the place
whence you came although it is known to but few and
can be used only by those who are chosen also remem-
ber that you came to troyana of your own free will and
accord and so the way was open to you so must you
leave but once you have left the way will then be for-
ever closed to you and yours make not your decision
hastily my brethren but consult one with the other and
tomorrow here give to the council your answer if you
refuse never again will the chance to depart be offered
to you if you choose to go never again may you re-
turn now go in peace and may the blessings of the
great architect rest on you and may his wisdom guide
you to a true choice for my mind is torn and i know
not how to advise you

  silently we saluted and withdrew not a word did
we speak until we were back in our rooms willis first
broke the silence

  thank god we are getting out of this hole he ex-
claimed heartily i am so damned glad to get away that
i am resigned to losing that gold plate we saw at
nahums

  mariston whistled softly through his teeth

  what do you say dune he asked

  well i remarked cautiously there is a good deal
to be said on both sides there is a lot to be learned here
and id like to stay a few months or even years longer
but that is out of the question since this is to be our
only chance to get out possibly we ought to take it id
like to see molly again but on the other hand arent
we almost in honor bound to stay and see the end of it
nonsense  said willis hotly its none of our fight
shut up ray replied mariston let each man
have his say and then well argue it what is your de-
cision dune

  i think we really ought to stick it out even though
i would like to go i answered with a heavy heart
thankful that molly could not hear me say it i vote
to stay here

  im going to stay said nankivell shortly

  because of estha asked mariston

  nankivell nodded

  thats the very reason why you are going replied
mariston i am the exact opposite of duncan i
would like to stay but i vote for going and so will you
frank when you hear me i wont stay because of

balkis a little longer in her company and i wouldnt
be able to go and nahum has shown me very plainly
that nothing more tragic than a marriage between one
of them and one of us could happen neither estha
nor balkis could live in the world as we know it and
be happy and neither of us could live happily in troyana
each must keep to his own country old man oil and
water wont mix excellent as each one is alone no
frank youre going out with me

  and leave her  i will not said nankivell hotly

  yes you will old man and for the very reason that
now makes you declare you are going to stay because
you love her youll leave her ill talk with you tonight
and i think that i can make you see it dune you are
free to do as you please for you have  foreign en-
tanglements if the rest of us go will you go or stay

  ill let majority rule i answered with a heart sud-
denly lighter

  all right then thats settled we leave said maris-
ton

  you may but i wont retorted nankivell

  well see what you say in the morning replied
mariston dune you and ray turn in frank you
come with me we are going to thrash this thing out

            chapter xx
            pedros body

the events of the day had naturally excited me
and that alone was probably enough to account for
my broken rest that night leaving out entirely the
emotions which the possibility of again seeing molly had
raised whatever the cause was i slept very poorly
whenever i woke which i did at frequent intervals i
could hear nankivell and mariston arguing in the next
room there was no doubt in my mind that the course
which mariston advocated was that of common sense
but i couldnt help sympathizing with nankivell i
tried to think what my decision would be under such
circumstances but the problem was too much for me
thankful that i did not have to advise nankivell i
finally settled myself to sleep with a feeling that the
matter was on the knees of the gods

  neither mariston nor nankivell volunteered any in-
formation at breakfast the next morning and neither
willis nor i cared to question them when the meal
had been finished nankivell arose with a muttered word
of what seemed to be rather sullen apology and left the
room we turned to mariston questioningly

	hes going said mariston it is a pretty hard blow
to him but i made him see the light i wouldnt say
anything about it to him if i were you it is one of
those things that are better not discussed he has gone
to her

  nankivell did not return until after supper time and
when he did the change in his attitude was very marked
he had left in the morning with a sullen rebellious and
rather hopeless air but he returned almost cheerful his
disinclination to talk about the matter had left him and
he chatted with us in a normal manner and seemed to be
almost eager in planning our return i realized that i
ought to keep quiet but curiosity overcame me at last

  flow does estha look on our departure i asked

  maristons fist clenched and he shot me a dark look
but nankivell answered promptly without a trace of em-
barrassment
the drums

of tapajos



  she took it rather hard at first just as i did he
answered but she soon saw the force of bobs argu-
ments balkis was there and when she heard that bob
favored our leaving she sided with him and agreed that
the course we were taking was by far the wisest

  for some reason mariston did not look entirely happy
at nankivells words he flushed slightly and was about
to speak when the entrance of nahum put an end to
further conversation nahum saluted us affectionately
and told us that the council had assembled and were
awaiting our arrival at his suggestion we donned our
ceremonial robes of blue and followed him to the asylum-
our entrance was affected by the usual ceremonies with
which we were by then sufficiently familiar to go
through with in hebrew without assistance we were
conducted to the altar before the master who greeted
us courteously and asked if we made our decision
we have most worshipful sir replied mariston
who was naturally the spokesman of our party
communicate it to me directed zephaniah

  we have decided with your gracious permission to
return to the place whence we came he answered

  it grieves me greatly so to hear replied the master
and yet i applaud your answer as that directed by wis-
dom brother nankivell is this decision made of your
own free will and accord made without outside in-
fluence without fear of punishment or hope of reward
and without possibility of future retraction

  it is answered nankivell promptly

  the same question was propounded to each of us and
when we had all answered in the affirmative the master
announced himself as satisfied

  in order to teach you the means of departure it
will be necessary to communicate to you certain portions
of the cryptic degree he went on this will involve
taking upon yourselves certain additional oaths obli-
gations and duties in addition to those which you have
hitherto taken and have observed the assurances which
have previously been given to you are repeated being
thus reassured are you willing to proceed

  we answered in the affirmative

  it is my order that this assembly of planners be now
closed he proclaimed brother chancellor is the
master of the cryptic degree within the sanctuary or
has he furnished you with orders

  most worshipful sir he is not within the sanctuary
and no orders have been received from him

  then by virtue of my authority as the worshipful
senior warden of the cryptic degree in the absence of
the right worshipful master it is my order that an
assembly of the cryptic degree be now opened he
said brother chancellor you will clear the asylum
of all who have not been exalted brother chamberlain
you will prepare the candidates

  my obligation forces me to draw the veil over the
elaborate and very impressive ceremonies that occupied
the next three hours suffice it to say that in the end
we found that we had learned many things not only
had we learned how we were to leave the city but we
had learned something that was of the greatest scientific
interest to me at least the peculiar form of energy
that was used in the atomic generators of troyana the
scarcity of which was causing so much concern was the
comparatively common element cobalt there was only
one source of this material within the limits of troyana
and that was in the vault which was always guarded by
one of the three keepers of the sacred treasure

  at the conclusion of the ceremonies zephaniah gave
us our final orders

  my brethren he said the night has far advanced
and the rest of it and the day are given you for repose
and refreshment tomorrow night at the second hour
before dawn you will come here prepared to depart as
a slight token of my esteem and gratitude the steward
will bring to each of you a small package in it you
will find enough diamonds to enable you to live without
the grim necessity of manual labor as becomes nobles
of troyana in the outside world to which you are going
i trust that you will use the leisure which this gift will
grant to you in labor for the good of mankind more
especially your brethren is there any other thing that
is within my power to grant that you desire

  there is worshipful senior warden replied nan-
kivell there reposes in the sanctuary the body of a
dear friend who gave his life for me and also in a meas-
ure for you i would like to be given his body so that
i may take it with me and lay it respectfully to rest in
the forest whence he came

  your request is granted answered zephaniah it
is such a request as i would expect to hear from you
brother nankivell do any other of you have a desire
then may the blessings of the great architect rest on
you and on us all and may you go your ways ever in
peace amen

  so mote it be came a deep-toned chorus from
around us

  the day passed rapidly it took time to go the rounds
of the sanctuary and bid farewell to our many friends
in troyana and many of the farewells were sad and
hard to say for we had made real friends there and we
all knew that it was a last farewell for it had been
repeatedly told to us that there was no retracing the
route which we were taking

  we changed our troyana robes for the tramping gar-
ments in which we had entered the city and made up
our packs substituting for the missing sarque and
guarana some of the marvelous concentrated foodstuffs
of which the sanctuary contained so large a store when
we were ready for travel and had tested the weight
of our packs willis was disposed to object to the ad-
dition of the weight of pedros body to our load maris-
ton was non-committal but i sided strongly with nanki-
vell i felt that he was giving up enough as it was and
that if he felt like taking pedro along that that much
was due him anyway nankivell flatly refused to move
a step without it so willis was forced to give way he
did so and agreed to take it at least as far as the jungle
although he grumbled a little at what he termed senti-
mental damnfoolishness

as midnight approached nankivell left us and went
 to prepare pedros body for the trip he declined
my proffered assistance and i stayed with mariston and
willis who were engaged in going for the twentieth
time over our return route after we had left the road
our instructor was hosea the junior deacon who had
at one time spent forty years in the jungle as warder
of the outer ways with the aid of his detailed instruc-
tions a map he drew and our compasses and pedom-
eters we had little fear of going astray in addition
he gave to us a sign which he assured us would be heed-
ed by the cowans who guarded the jungle trails and tell
them that we had a right to pass and repass at will
at last the hour arrived


amazing stories

  dune come and help me with the body will you
called nankivell from the next room

  i went to him and found that he had wrapped the
body in many folds of linen and had tied it securely the
weight rather surprised me as i had an idea that an em-
balmed body was always lighter than a living one but
i accounted for the weight by the large quantity of
wrappings he had put on it he took the head and i
the feet and we followed our guides to the asylum which
had been cleared of all save those of the cryptic degree

   our final farewells and prayers were here spoken and
the steward handed to each of us the packages which
zephaniah had promised the day before when all was
ready we stepped back from the altar and zephaniah
with a final word of prayer spoke certain words in
response to his commands the altar revolved slowly to
one side and we followed nahum down the flight of
stairs which the movement had revealed they were
thick with dust of ages and small wonder for we had
learned the night before that they had not been used for
over six hundred years i tried to count steps but at
somewhere around five hundred and fifty i lost count
down and down we went into the very bowels of the
earth stopping now and then to rest the weight of
pedros body became a heavy burden but mariston and
willis relieved me from time to time exhausted as he
must have been nankivell refused to surrender his place
to anyone

   at last we came to level ground or rather a level pas-
sage in the rock and nahum told us that we were below
the level of the crypt for perhaps two miles we fol-
lowed him along the passage which was dimly lighted
by a hand lamp which he carried and then at a word
from him we paused he advanced to the wall and
manipulated some dials and levers and we saw on the
wall before us an empty corridor rapidly he searched
the rooms and corridors adjacent to the one we had first
seen and then spoke

  when the door opens move rapidly he directed
we must move some twenty yards and be in the con-
veyance that will take us to the entrance where you first
saw me before we are detected the corridors approach-
ing the one we will enter are empty now but some may
be coming from a distance and as you know our convey-
ances travel rapidly

  using the same words with which zephaniah had
moved the altar he lowered a door before us and strode
rapidly forward the door closed behind him of its
own volition and in a few moments we were seated in a
conveyance and although we knew that we were going
principally in a forward direction the slight grade and
the rapidity of our motion gave us the impression of
dropping presently this feeling passed and we felt that
we were rising again the car stopped and a door
opened and we stood again in the corridor where we had
first met nahum several months before it seemed to me
that only a few minutes had passed and i had to shake
my head to make me realize what we had been through
we were not yet clear of the confines of troyana and
already its wonders seemed like a dream

  the door to the outside world opened at nahums
command and we stepped forth again on the road by
which we had first approached the lost city only
instead of our faithful pedro walking with us his dead
and embalmed body was borne sadly along

  our parting with nahum was brief but sad we had
all come to love the old gentleman and he had grown

fond of us too in his reserved way he wrung us
warmly by the hand and wished us all good fortune with
equanimity but when he came to say farewell to nanki-
vell i caught the suspicion of a tear in his eye

  farewell my son he said slowly for as a son i
love you and it is my sorrow that you cannot actually
be my son for your own good and for hers i have
acted and when the first pain has passed you will each
bless me for my actions and now my brethren may
the blessings of-

  he essayed to give us the conventional blessing of
troyana but his voice broke and he turned hastily and
retreated into the hill and the massive door crashed shut
behind him

  and thats that remarked willis a little huskily as
we strode forward his eye lighted suddenly lets
stop and take a look at the rocks that zephaniah gave
us he said

  all right said mariston go ahead and look ill
keep my eyes open and be ready to make the peace
signal i dont want to stop an arrow after all we have
been through

  i was no expert on gems but willis was after a
careful examination he announced that at a conserva-
tive estimate the diamonds that had been given us were
worth half a million dollars for each of us

  not a bad haul he commented

  no its not replied mariston thoughtfully but
now that its too late i wish that i had sided with dune
and frank id give the whole business for an hour
more with balkis

  the dawn was just breaking as we started with
fresh muscles and a good road under us we made ex-
cellent time even with the handicap of our burden and
a little over two hours of steady hiking brought us to
the point where we were to leave the road for the
jungle we rested for half an hour and then turned
into the trail and headed for our canoe which we
planned on reaching by the night of the second day
thanks to the instructions for a better route which hosea
had given us

  the trail along which we went was fairly open but the
heat began to get bad and the weight of our burden
seemed to increase momentarily for two hours we
struggled on and then willis who was carrying one end
put it down and mopped his brow

  frank he said i have given in to you on this mat-
ter so far but we are coming to harder going every
minute and i dont see how we are going to carry this
body any farther unless we throw away our guns and
packs and that would be suicidal i appreciate your
feelings but we have got pedro back to the jungle even
if it isnt his native one and i dont see why we cant
bury him here just as well as any other place at any
rate im not going to carry him any farther

mariston nodded assent and nankivell turned to
me i looked sheepish but the thought of strug-
gling under that burden any longer broke my spirit
and i nodded as well

  too bad said nankivell solemnly i had hoped to
carry it farther but i cant do it alone and since you
fellows wont help me ill have to give in if it goes
any farther it will have to go under its own power
help me to unwrap it

  why not bury it as it is i asked we have no
means of making a coffin here
the drums of tapajos



  oh lets have another look at him protested nanki-
vell his knife busy on the bindings

  we cut the thongs and took off several layers of linen
nankivell straightened up and looked at us

  fellows he said do me one favor will you
step away a few paces and keep your backs turned while
i finish this job id rather do it without witnesses
we humored him and stepped away for a few paces
we could hear him at work and presently his voice
broke the stillness

  all right fellows you can look now

  we turned and looked for a moment we stood there
smitten with amazement and then nankivells laugh
broke the quiet before us was not the body of pedro
cold in death but instead standing there smiling was
estha

  mariston was the first to speak

  what the- how the- he sputtered frank

what the devil does this mean 

  oh nothing much said nankivell airily i saw
that you had the drop on me when it came to arguing
so i gave up and put the problem up to estha she felt
just like i did about it but we knew that we couldnt
win you over so we just decided to let you have your
own way and make a private addition of our own to
your plans and we did 

  when was this planned asked mariston

  the day before yesterday that was why i was so
willing to fall in with your ideas when i came back from
talking to estha balkis helped us out on it and if there
had been some way of bringing her along too we would
have let you in on it but there wasnt anyway you
hadnt even told balkis that you wanted her to come
you know that you can never go back mariston
said to estha
i dont want to she said i made up my mind to
come with frank just as you made up your mind to
leave balkis well see in a few years which one of us
was the wisest

  well have to change our plans interrupted willis
we cant go on on this rpute for they know just how
we are going well have to hunt another trail

  i dont think so replied nankivell in the first
place estha is in bed sick in troyana so far as nahum
knows and i think that balkis can keep him fooled until
we are on the river there is no use in changing routes
anyway we have to go to the river eventually and
if we took a longer path they would just cut us off at
the canoe

  theres some sense in that remarked willis miss
estha you know nahums disposition better than we do
will there be any pursuit

  i cant tell she answered i am his only descend-
ant and he loves me greatly and if i were dragged back
it would mean my death one of the most immutable
laws of troyana is that of prescribing death for desert-
ers that is all that i can tell

  i doubt greatly whether there will be any said
mariston even if nahum urged it i dont believe that
zephaniah would authorize any of the remaining few of
the cryptic degree to leave the city i am more afraid
that amos may find out that we have left the city and
pursue us nahums only chance would be to have
cowans sent after us

  i dont think that there is much danger of either
of those contingencies happening i said amos has
too little cobalt to waste any of it in wildcat observation

of the jungle and i dont think that he will ever see us
as far as calling the indians is concerned i am positive
that zephaniah would not allow the projectors to be used
for that purpose for they take a tremendous amount of
power and he has less than amos has there is another
thing to remember we have in no way violated our obli-
gations and i never heard of a woman taking any it
seems to me that zephaniah has no real grounds on
which to base a pursuit

  thats all true mused mariston i expect that
the best thing for us to do is to keep on with our original
plans if zephaniah wants to see us no route that we
can take will balk him for we have to move by the river
in any case we are safe from the swamps along this
route thanks to hoseas map and there are indians
everywhere miss estha is that cloth impregnated with
tin

   certainly she replied

  then the only suggestion that i would make is that
estha walk between frank and me and that we each keep
a portion of it around us like a robe that may protect
her from casual observation and at night we can rig a
tent of it that she can sleep under thats about all that
we can do except to make as good speed as possible and
trust to luck to get out of it with whole skins

  in the formation which mariston had suggested we
plunged ahead into the jungle

chapter xxi

nankivell to the rescue

the route which hosea had taught us was a vast
improvement over the one by which we had ap-
proached troyana the ground was higher and
more open and the terrible plague of insect life which
had tormented us was to a large extent missing esthas
costume was hardly such as an experienced traveller
would choose for a jungle trip and had we tried to re-
trace our steps over the old route her sufferings would
have been terrible even as it was the mosquitos and
the ticks were present in large enough numbers to make
the journey unpleasant to say the least

  we plodded on for nearly three hours before the in-
creasing heat forced us to stop for rest according to
our pedometers we had thus far traversed nearly thir-
teen miles from the spot where we had left nahum
mariston suggested that we make a tent of the tin-im-
pregnated linen which we had brought from troyana
and i tried to do so but when i had it constructed it
was evident that she could not stay in it the thick close
weave of the cloth cut off every bit of air and made the
tent like the inside of a baking oven even bob admit-
ted after he had spent a few minutes in its shelter that
his idea was impractical the next best thing that he
could suggest was to rig some of it as a canopy over
the head of the entire party and rest on the ground under
it even this made it hot but we felt that we could stand
it and that it might be of advantage as a partial shield
against casual observation

  shall we set a watch  asked nankivell

  of course replied willis remember that we
are out in the jungle again

  i believe that we ought to agreed mariston ill
take it if you wish

  no draw straws for it i said the loser keeps
watch during the siesta and is relieved at night


amazing stories

  fair enough said willis bob get four blades of
grass and well draw

  of course after suggesting such a method i had to
be the unlucky one and draw the short blade of grass
the others laughed and threw themselves at full length
on the ground to rest and sleep a couple of hours while
i shouldered my rifle and fell to walking tired as i
was i knew that i would drop off to sleep in a few mo-
ments if i didnt keep moving forward and back i
paced varying the monotony of my route by taking an
occasional turn around the camp and fighting off fatigue
and weariness as best i could

  the jungle was silent with the curious hush that often
overtakes the tropical jungle at noon on a quiet day
when even the insects seem to feel the heat and lie quiet
until the temperature falls the sweat trickled down
my face and dropped off the end of my nose and the
point of my chin and i didnt have enough energy to
wipe it off the quiet became oppressive and i could
feel my nerves drawing taut there was absolutely not
a sound that could have raised my suspicions but i sud-
denly felt that unseen eyes were peering at me

  i whirled suddenly in my tracks hoping to surprise
some lurking spy but not a movement of a leaf re-
warded my effort with a shrug of my shoulders i
turned my back and resumed my pacing but the feeling
that i was being watched grew stronger and stronger it
occurred to me that it was possible that one or more in-
dians were lurking in the undergrowth and i laid down
my rifle and made the sign of peace toward each point
of the compass but without result

  i shook myself and resolved to throw off such childish
feelings and glanced at my watch in an instant the
hair rose on the back of my neck and i knew where were
the phantom eyes whose gaze i had felt from the face
of the watch long iridescent streamers visible even in
mid-day were leaping i turned toward the sleepers and
strove to raise my voice to call them but an unaccount-
able feeling of weakness and lassitude seemed to en-
velope me i struggled against it and staggered forward
hoping to touch one of them but my limbs seemed to be
made of lead and i could barely drag them my tongue
was completely paralyzed nearer and nearer i strug-
gled it seemed for a moment that i would reach them
but a weight seemed to be pressing on my shoulders and
i staggered and then wilted slowly to the ground i
made a last effort and rolled toward them at the same
time exerting all of my will power in an attempt to cry
out

  bob

   dont know whether my lips actually formed the
word that my mind shouted for just as i was about to
utter it a wave of darkness swept over me and blotted
out all the scene before me i was falling falling
falling-

  i came to myself with a start my first impression
was that i had fallen asleep on guard but a moment of
concentrated effort enabled me to recall what had hap-
pened i jumped to my feet with a start and the cry that
i had started burst from my lips in a shriek

  bob

  mariston raised his head with a grunt but willis
sprang to his feet like a startled deer his pistol in his
hand by the time he had risen

  what is it he demanded looking around

  i dont know i stammered i must have been
dreaming is everything all right 

  why yes he answered looking down no by
thunder it isnt frank bob turnout the girls
gone

  gone i gasped stupidly the fumes of that strange
sleep seemed to still clog my brain

  for answer he pointed at the place where estha had
lain it was empty although the impress of her body
still showed faintly on the vegetation by this time
nankivell and mariston were on their feet

  wheres estha were nankiveils first words

  gone i mumbled

  gone  where did she go and when  he demanded

  i dont know i replied feebly she was there all
right a few minutes ago but when i woke up she was
gone

  when you woke up  asked mariston

  yes i returned i dropped off to sleep and when
i woke up she was gone

with an inarticulate cry of rage nankivell sprang
at me his face working convulsively and in his
eyes the light of murder willis caught him as he leaped
and in the face of his strength nankivells struggles
were as those of a child

  steady youngster admonished willis keep your
shirt on

  the damned traitor went to sleep and let her be
stolen gasped nankivell as he made another attempt
to get at me

  take it easy boy counseled willis you arent
going to make matters any better by acting like a kid
sit quiet and lets hear about it

  nankivell struggled for a moment longer but he was
helpless in willis grasp and gradually his rage subsided
and he ceased struggling willis quietly sat him on the
ground but kept a sharp eye on him

  how did it happen dune  he asked

  i collected my scattered wits and told him as clearly as
i could when i came to the matter of the watch he
drew in his breath with a sharp hiss but he did not
interrupt me until i had finished nankivell had watched
me with an angry glare in his eyes as i started my tale
but as the story progressed the anger faded from his
eyes and when i had finished he rose and held out his
hand

  i beg your pardon dune he said simply

  i shook his hand in silence it was the first word of
anger that i had ever received from frank nankivell
but the handsome way in which he atoned for his out-
burst made me forgive him without rancor

  so old nahum got her back mused willis

  nahum or amos answered mariston

  by thunder thats right exclaimed willis it
might have been either bunch both of them have ob-
servation posts and projectors at their service what
happened to you dune

  rays of some sort i answered they affected my
watch and that is proof to me that they came from troy-
ana projectors just what they were i dont know i
got the cryptic degree so hurriedly that i couldnt digest
most of it

  what difference does it make cried nankivell
weve got to go after her at once

  how long has it been since you were knocked out
dune asked willis

  i glanced at my watch and gave a cry of surprise it
had been just a few minutes after eleven when i had
the drums of tapajos



seen the rays playing on it and when i looked again it
was half past five

  over six hours start said willis when i told him
they had plenty of time to get back on the road or even
into the city itself i am afraid that a chase would be
hopeless unless we were willing to follow her back into
the city or even into the sanctuary itself

   ill follow her to hell  replied nankivell

  there or heaven is where youll probably wind up if
you try to follow her answered willis quietly it
will be pitch dark in another hour and a half and we
couldnt hope to make the road by that time we will
have to wait here for the night and that gives them an-
other twelve hours of start which would assure their re-
turn to the city before we left this spot im afraid that
its hopeless

  mariston slowly nodded assent nankivell looked
from one to the other and then at me the force of
willis arguments was too much for me and i silently
shook my head

  so none of you have the guts to go back with me he
cried all right ill do better without a bunch of
quitters with me anyway

  he seized his rifle and pack from the ground and
started toward the trail he cast a scornful glance around
and saw that mariston was calmly adjusting his pack
what are you doing he demanded

  oh dont be such a fool frank replied mariston in
a weary voice if you are going back im going with
you of course

  nankivell hesitated and i moved slowly over and
started to sling my pack he looked at me questioningly

  of course bobs going i said as i picked up my
rifle in point of fact were all going i dont think
that there is one chance in a million that any of us will
ever live to see troyana let alone the sanctuary but
well try it

  yes chimed in willis as he struggled with his pack
straps its the craziest stunt that i ever heard of but
if that fool youngster just naturally insists on getting
himself killed i might as well keep him company
nankivells face grew as red as fire

  i beg your pardon fellows he stammered you
are real pals all right but you mustnt go

  why not demanded mariston

  why its just as dune says i havent one chance
in a million to ever win through and you mustnt throw
away your lives on a wild-goose chase like that besides
you fellows have nothing to gain and everything to lose
and im just the other way around

  oh shut up and quit arguing said mariston rudely
if you go we go and thats all there is to it were
just wasting time before we start however we ought
to decide where we are going

  why to troyana of course exclaimed nankivell
  what particular part

  nankivell paused

  wherever estha is he replied after a moment of
thought

  agreed but where shall we try first the sanctuary
or the city if we go to the sanctuary after the road is
closed to us it means sudden and painful death even
allowing that we can get there or i miss my guess iif
we go to the city it means slower but considerably more
painful death in neither case will we probably see
estha even if we chose the right place to look for her
its your funeral frank take your choice

  we can decide that as we go replied nankivell
there is another point that may not have occurred
to you said willis its just possible that we would
be going straight away from her

  what do you mean

  it is more than possible that nahum if he is the
party responsible for her absence has communicated
with the warder of the outer ways and the indian
guards have captured her and have her here in the jungle
where she will be kept until we are disposed of
nankivells face blanched

  do you think that possible he asked

  more than possible said mariston i hadnt thought
of it before but now that willis has mentioned it it
seems quite probable he would know that you would
hotfoot it back and he might very easily have done that
very thing

  what do you think is the best thing to do 

  its too late to do much of anything tonight said
willis it is getting too dark to trail right now and in
another hour it will be entirely dark if we are going
the best thing to do is to wait for daylight and see if
we cant pick up a trail if we can all right if we
cant we can hit for troyana and go it blind

  nankivell grudgingly assented to willis program
and we made camp for the night while the light still
lasted before we had our netting up darkness had
fallen and the booming of mosquitos prophesied torment
for the unlucky men who had to mount guard

the long sleep we had had in the afternoon had
rested us and we sat up and discussed plans until
nearly midnight gradually the conversation lagged and
presently a gentle snore from willis proclaimed his de-
parture into the land of dreams

  im not sleepy bob said nankivell i am so wor-
ried that i wouldnt sleep anyway ill take the first
watch and when i get tired ill call you or ray

  mariston sleepily grunted an assent and nankivell
took his rifle and slipped out from under the covering
for a while i watched him pace his beat dimly outlined
in the brilliant moonlight that filtered down through the
leaves and than i joined mariston in sleep

  i woke to find it broad daylight and mariston shaking
me by the shoulder

  look here dune he said handing me a sheet of
paper i stared dumbly at it for a moment and then
recognized it as a sheet torn from a notebook which i
had seen in nankivells possession i turned it over and
saw that both sides were covered with tiny writing done
in pencil

   am it read dear fellows i have been
thinking it over and i know that i have no right to let
you go with me especially after what  have seen to-
night while i was on guard i heard the drums again
i knew that it meant death for the one who heard them
so i didnt wake you but kept a close watch the drum-
ming grew louder and louder and i thought that my
head would burst and then i saw her i tell you i saw
her as though she were standing before me her arms
were bound and she stood before the altar of the golden
calf with a dozen burden bearers around her i knew
then where she was she didnt know that i could see
or hear her the brutes were threatening her in atlan-
tean and she looked at them proudly and shook her head
and said something one of them struck her with a sort
of whip that he held and she cried frank that settled


amazing

stories

it for me i am going to her although i know that i
am watched and havent a dogs chance to win through
but ill die trying to reach her anyway i didnt wake
you because i know that you would insist on going along
and i dont want you to i took all of the ammunition
except twenty rounds for each of you because i may
need it i have left my share of zephaniahs diamonds
in payment divide them equally between you please
dont try to follow me fellows i will have four or five
hours start and you cant catch me by the time you
could leave the camp i will be in troyana-or dead
good-bye fellows and thanks for the help you would
give me if i woke you frank

  i read the message twice before i spoke

  what are we going to do i asked

  what can we do asked mariston sadly frank
is right he is either in troyana or heaven by now if
i thought that there was one chance in a million of win-
ning through and helping him id go after him but he
has been clever enough to stop us entirely

  how so  i asked

  he took nearly all the ammunition replied mariston
it would be folly to try to storm troyana with three
hundred and fifty rounds it would be suicidal to try
it with fifty-three and that is all he has left us he has
taken my automatic too no dune he evidently meant
it when he said that we were not to follow him i hate
as badly as you do to desert him but it cant be helped

  i heard footsteps and looked up willis was approach-
ing from the direction of troyana

   i followed his trail for about half a mile and then lost
it on hard ground he reported his tracks are at
least five hours old and he headed straight for the road
im afraid that there isnt a bit of use in trying to over-
take him

  it seemed like the basest kind of treachery to desert
him but there was nothing else to do without ammuni-
tion and short one pistol it would indeed have been
suicidal to try to storm the halls of troyana especially
when we had abundant reason to know that our every
movement was watched and that our enemies would be
awaiting us if we had had the least idea that he was
even alive i think that we would have gone after him
but the odds were so great that he was dead that we
finally gave tip discussing it and turned our faces sadly
toward home again

chapter xxii
the warder of the outer ways

  a ll day we doggedly made our way onward thq
plague of insect life was not as bad as it had been
x x- on the outward trip but the ticks and mosquitos
were numerous enough to make it very unpleasant for
us toward evening the ground began to fall rapidly
and the jungle to get thicker sure proof to willis that
we were approaching the river we came to a stream
that led in the general direction that we were going and
we essayed to follow it but the multitudes of leeches
which fastened on us soon forced us to take to the
jungle again and work our way through the lianas and
other creeping plants

  by nightfall we had covered a good distance and as
nearly as we could judge from hoseas map we were
within six miles of the place where we had left our
canoe the last two miles had been through mud that

was ankle deep and the prospect of spending the night
half sunk in the ooze and slime underfoot was not one
that induced us to linger

  how about it ray asked mariston shall we try
to keep on going in the hope of reaching the canoe to-
night 

  willis studied the ground before replying

  i dont think so he answered in the first place
as soon as the sun sets it will get as dark as the inside
of a cow here and i doubt whether we could keep our
direction close enough to make any speed even with the
aid of the luminous compass we would probably
wander around and not make over two miles forward
during the entire night i hate to sleep in this muck as
badly as you do but i think that its the only thing to
do

  accordingly we set our watches and mariston and
willis stretched themselves in the mire after a meager
supper and left me on guard i found it almost impos-
sible to keep awake the steady marching of the day
coupled with the stirring events we had gone through
had exhausted me both mentally and physically and i
was soon sure that the watch which i was keeping was so
lax as to be practically worthless my tour finally ended
and i hesitated whether or not to call willis who had the
middle watch i realized that he was as tired as i was
and i finally lay down beside him without calling him i
felt that if we were doomed to be surprised that night
that such a watch as any one of us could manage to keep
would not prevent it

  the false dawn had died and the short period of in-
tense darkness that heralds the true dawn was at its
densest when i awoke with a start i sat bolt upright
listening intently but no matter how i strained my
ears there was no sound that would account for my sud-
den start into complete wakefulness a glance at the
face of my watch showed me that it was behaving nor-
mally although it still gave out an abnormally brilliant
glow from the excitation which it had recently received
there were however none of the long tell-tale streamers
coming from the dial and i shrugged my shoulders and
thought that i must have been dreaming i listened
again for a short time but gave it up and lay down
again to sleep

  hardly had i reached a prone position than i sat bolt
upright again with another start faint and far-distant
and almost imperceptible it was but none the less i knew
it it was the fatal drums of tapajos it was so faint
that i thought for a moment that i must be dreaming
and i tried plugging up my cars with my fingers this
test resolved the last of my uncertainty for it intensified
the drumming with a groan i reached over and grasped
willis by the shoulder to shake him

  at my touch he sprang to his feet in that state of
complete wakefulness that characterizes animals and
marks men who have spent their years in danger of
their lives

  what is it he asked in an undertone as he surveyed
the country as best he could in the darkness his drawn
pistol in his hand

  shhhh i whispered listen

  he bent his head and listened the drumming had
momentarily ceased and he held his strained attitude
while he was listening i shook mariston and he sat up
quickly but much more slowly than the cat-like bound
which had characterized willis awakening

   the three of us stood with straining ears listening for
the drums

of tapajos



any sound from the jungle the usual nocturnal noises
of the jungle were silent for the most part and only a
faint hum of insect life was audible willis hearing was
keener than mine and he caught the sound of the drum-
ming before either mariston or i did when it started
again

  the drums  he muttered hoarsely what the devil
is it dune are those devils after us again

  hush exclaimed mariston see if it is getting
louder it may not be meant for us

  we listened intently and for a moment i hoped that
maristons words might have some foundation in fact
for the sound got no louder and indeed seemed to be
dying out fainter and fainter it got until we could
hardly distinguish it again and then for a moment it
ceased as it stopped a faint whisper of sound came to
us from miles away it was faint and almost indistin-
guishable among the other faint noises of the night but it
was enough to blanch our faces with terror it was
the distant long-drawn-out hunting cry of the guardian

  as it died away in the distance so far away in fact
that the bubbling grunt which ordinarily ended it was
totally inaudible the drums started again and this time
they were unquestionably louder

  while we had been listening the dawn had started and
we could dimly see one anothers outlines i looked at
the others and met questioning glances from them
listen said mariston

  still faint and far-distant it was but appreciably
nearer than it had been the first time there was no
doubt that it was the cry of the guardian for the entire
call was audible to our sharpened senses

  damn it exploded willis why in thunder didnt
frank leave us more ammunition

  never mind frank i replied the question is not
what frank left but what are we to do

  nothing that i know of said mariston with a
mirthless laugh there arent any trees here that we
can climb as there were a few miles back and we know
enough of that creature to realize how futile a spring-
field bullet is going to be of course we can scatter and
may be one will get through but since the brutes hunt
in packs of three i dont think that will do much good

the drumming was more distinct now from time
to time it would die out until it was almost inaudi-
ble and then would come that horrible blood-curdling
shriek each time nearer than the time before

  it wont be long now said mariston with a sickly
grin in what was evidently an imitation of nankivells
usual tone

  lets scatter exclaimed willis its a slim chance
ill admit but i think its our only one

  we were about to obey his suggestion when a sudden
thought struck me

  wait a minute i cried bob didnt nahum tell us
that these brutes always traveled in packs with some
of the cowans along with them

  yes he did said mariston as he paused

  stick together then i said fellows its not hope-
less yet we have the sign to give to the cowans to
protect ourselves if they approach within seeing dis-
tance before these things get us we may have a chance
yet

  right dune cried mariston spread out a little
and make the sign as soon as those howls get close
what about the drumming asked willis

  i dont know he replied weve got to take some
kind of a chance and i believe that dune is right and that
we have a better chance this way than any other

  nearer and nearer came the howls of the approaching
guardian until it was evident that the pack was not more
than a few hundred yards away in the jungle as had
happened in our previous encounter with them the cries
suddenly ceased only to be repeated in a moment from
behind us and then from one side the beasts were
circling us only a short distance away and yet despite
the size and apparent unwieldiness of their bodies as we
had seen them in nahums instruments not a trace of
the sound of their passage through the jungle could we
hear we waited for their nearer approach

  the drumming which had grown more and more in-
sistent rose to a crescendo and then came the hateful
whish of an arrow i must have caught a glimpse of it
as it appreached for without conscious volition i sud-
denly threw the butt of my gun up before my face
well indeed was it for me that i did so for there was a
slight jar on the gun and the thud of the arrow hitting
the wood was plainly to be heard

  the sign i gasped that arrow was meant to hit
mariston and willis dropped their guns and put them-
selves in the proper position and gave the sign in-
stantly a weird call sounded in the jungle and the voice
of the guardian was suddenly silent the call was re-
peated and i could make out the fact that it was sylla-
bated but the language was one that i did not know
none of us replied but i recovered my wits enough to
drop my gun and join the others in making the sign
again the weird call came insistently from the jungle
what are we supposed to do  asked mariston
darned if i know i answered stand still that
is the safest thing that i can think of

  i almost caught the words of that cry last time said
willis i wish the fool would repeat it

  his wish was not long of fulfillment for again the cry
arose willis grunted in satisfaction and pitching his
voice on a peculiar low wailing note he emitted a series
of syllables which meant nothing to me apparently
they meant more to the rest of the auditors for the cry
came again from the jungle this time comparatively
close

  talk to them ray thats a good chap said mariston
nervously tell them that youre santa claus or some-
thing like that

  shut up ejaculated willis as he replied again to
the voice from the jungle

  for some time the colloquy went on and then willis
turned to us

  they are not satisfied he said the sign is right
and they dont dare to attack but he claims that if we
were from troyana as we say that the drumming would
stop or indeed would never have started

it must be amos who is drumming i exclaimed
tell him who we are and the condition in troyana
dont do it interrupted mariston if they know
that the power of the master is broken or at least
checked there is no telling what they will do

  what is the name of the warder of the outer
ways i asked suddenly

  gedaliah answered mariston after a moments
thought

  ray i said tell them to send for gedaliah in-
form them that as wearers of the crimson we order his
immediate presence here


amazing stories

  good stuff he answered and gave the message to
the cowan

  the indian replied and for several minutes the talk
went back and forth willis momentarily growing more
emphatic in his speech

  good he said at length my knowledge of the
names of the officers seemed to impress him he says
that gedaliah is a long way off but that he would deliver
our message to him meanwhile we are to remain here
without stirring as any attempt to move will result in a
shower of arrows and an attack from the guardian of
the jungle

  fair enough said mariston now theres nothing
to do but wait lets make ourselves comfortable

  the morning passed away in silence for some time
the drums kept up their throbbing but presently they
died away and quiet reigned the sun rose higher and
i began to yawn willis was already snoring and maris-
ton was nearly asleep knowing that we were sur-
rounded by enemies who could easily kill us without our
catching a glimpse of them we had seen no object in
keeping a watch indeed as mariston pointed out
setting a watch would tend to make our attackers think
that we were uncertain of our standing i was about to
stretch myself out in the mud and take a nap when an
interruption came

i had been drowsing but not asleep and it seemed
impossible that anyone could have approached me
from the rear without alarming me but someone did
for a voice spoke almost in my ear

  i jumped to my feet rubbing my eyes in amazement
and confronted a stately grey-haired man it did not
need the blue-bordered robe girded up over the leather
shod legs to tell me that one of the planners of troyana
stood before me one glance at his hawklike visage told
me who he was

  fraternal greetings brother gedaliah i said
stretching forth my hand willis and mariston strug-
gled to their feet as our hands met gedaliah looked at
me with cold suspicion in his eyes but as i applied the
telltale pressure the suspicion faded and was replaced
by a look of astonishment

  whence came you he asked

  i glanced around at the jungle his glance followed
mine and a look of understanding came into his eyes
he faced the jungle and gave some commands in the
same peculiar wail which willis had used in addressing
the indians

  now we can safely speak he said with a smile

  a few minutes of challenging assured him of my
knowledge and he began to question us the word of
the revolt of the bearers of burdens had not as yet
reached him and he was smitten dumb for a few minutes
when i had finished outlining the state of affairs in
troyana to him naturally i said nothing of estha or
of nankivell

  i thought it strange that i had received no orders or
communications from the master for so long he said
at length stroking his beard this then accounts for
the silence but what do you here why are you not
taking part in the defense

  i explained to him the reasons which had impelled the
master to send us from the city and he bowed

  his orders shall be obeyed he said my brethren
the stream which you seek is but five miles from here
your property has been moved from the place where

you left it but it shall be returned at once your canoe
of course has been devoured by termites but i shall give
you guides and warriors who will quickly construct you
a new one and who will paddle you down to the tapajos
there you will release them and send back by them this
token that it may be known that they have done what
was ordered i regret that i cannot go with you to
give you my personal aid

  where are you going i asked

  where could i go but to the rescue of the master
and my brethren he asked i will summon all of the
cowan guards and the packs of the guardians from all
sides and march at once to their rescue

  good for you exclaimed mariston would we
be of any help we would be glad to accompany you
i appreciate your offer and the master shall be in-
formed of it if i ever see him replied gedaliah with a
bow it is what i should expect from loyal brethren
did not the master however say that the way was for-
ever closed to you

  he did i admitted

  then again i say his orders shall be obeyed replied
the warder and now may the blessings of the great
architect rest on you and on all of our brethren and may
peace and happiness ever be yours go on your way and
fear nothing the guides will precede you and serve
you leave your impedimenta it will be carried by
your servants

  he spoke words of direction to the forest and a half
dozen indians came forward and shouldered our goods
without speech and trotted away into the jungle we
watched them go arid then turned to speak our thanks
to our new-found friend but he had disappeared

  well ill be darned exclaimed willis i thought
that i could move quietly but he beats any indian that i
ever saw well anyway we dont have to carry all that
junk lets move

  with lighter hearts than we had since our awakening
we took up our march

chapter xxiii
the call

when we reached the bank of the river we
found all of our goods intact and the indians
busily engaged in making a new canoe for us
when it was finished the skilled paddlers who
knew the stream like a book whisked us down to the
rio tapajos in short order we dismissed them there
and took the paddles ourselves and although the pad-
dling stiffened us up a little we had the advantage of
having the current with us and we made good speed
we passed bacabal without stopping and arrived in good
time at itaituba where our friend dom esteban wel-
comed us as men returned from the dead

  where is pedro was almost his first question
mariston told him something of the manner of pedros
death and the dom stroked his beard reflectively

  he was a good and faithful servant he said and
doubtless his death was such as he would have chosen
i will have many masses said for the repose of his
soul

  the dorns kind offices sped us on our way to belem
and it was only by requesting it of him as a favor that
we could get him to retain one of the smallest of the
diamonds with which zephaniah had presented us there
the drums of tapajos



was nothing worth noting in our trip to belem nor in the
trip to new york which followed i radioed molly that
i was coming and it was a very excited young woman
who met me at the dock and dragged me away to tell
her all about it while mariston and willis took our
diamonds to tiffanys for appraisal and safe-keeping

  tiffanys experts warned us against flooding the
market but they agreed to take them on consignment and
put them slowly into circulation for us while they
would not venture to give exact figures they stated that
willis appraisal was entirely too low and that the stones
excluding a few of the finest which we kept would net
us nearly a million each one of the finest i had set in
platinum for molly and requested both of my friends to
be present at the wedding which would take place in
ten days

  mariston accepted the invitation gladly but willis re-
fused he said that it had been his life-long ambition
to buck the tiger at monte carlo and that was where he
was going on the next boat he left in fine feather with
a hundred thousand good american dollars to his credit
the day before the wedding mariston received a collect
cable from him in which he asked for the price of a
ticket home molly and i discussed the advisability of
delaying the wedding until he arrived but mariston
would not hear of it

  i know ray willis he said and he is just as likely
to go to pekin as to return to new york i want to get
to work myself and i never will while i have you two
children on my hands go ahead and get married and
leave me in peace

  we followed his advice and did so we both tried to
insist that he make his home with us for a time at least
but he would not hear of it

  i cant do it dune he said i like you both but
i would be in the way you remember what zephaniah
told us to do i dont know how you are planning to
carry out his orders but i am going to central america
and start a model fruit plantation where work shall be
done efficiently and where the natives shall get humane
treatment i have knocked around there a good deal
and i know that something of the sort is needed and i
think that i may be able to do some good there and i
could do nothing here that others cant do a lot better

  i am going to endow a private research laboratory
i told him and try to develop into a usable form some
of the knowledge that i picked up in troyana i think
that i can do more good in that way than in any other

  i agree with you he said if your pile isnt
enough to carry out your ideas mine is always at your
call meanwhile you and molly can keep a room for
me and pll stay with you when i am in new york you
can let ray stay there for a while when he comes back-
if he ever does now pll leave you for i am sailing
tomorrow

  it was a good thing that molly and i did not wait for
willis return to get married for mariston had spoken
wisely he didnt go to pekin but he did go to alexan-
dria and get mixed up in some excavation work that
brought him foul of the egyptian government and i had
to wire him ninety thousand dollars less than two years
later to get him out of the scrape i told him that there
was a fortune waiting for him in new york and he
cabled back that he was coming after it and this time
he came i lost no time in getting in touch with maris-
ton and a month later we three sat in my laboratory
talking over old times and wishing nankivell was with us

  poor old frank said willis i am sorry that he had
to go and make such an ass of himself just when we had
the world by the tail i wonder what ever became of
him

  he was probably killed within an hour after he left
us i replied

  i dont think so dune said mariston with sudden
vigor i believe that he won through

  what makes you think so  i asked

  i have felt for months that he was alive and trying
to communicate with me he answered i cant tell
why i feel it but in my bones i do

  have you seen or heard anything that makes you
think so asked willis looking at him keenly

  nothing definite no why do you ask

  because i have had the same feeling said willis
i have felt that something was just outside my con-
sciousness trying to get inside once in particular when
i had some trouble with a bunch of fellaheen who were
working for me and one of them drugged me with
hasheesh i felt then that i was on the borderland and
i would have sworn that i heard his voice i put it
down to a dream but since you say what you do i am
not so sure

  that is strange replied mariston twice i have
seen him in a dream each time he was attired in the
crimson robes of the cryptic degree and he tried to
get a message across to me but he couldnt do it what
do you make of it dune have you had any such indi-
cations 

before replying to his question i went to my safe
and brought out a file of laboratory records

  i had not intended to mention this for i put it down
to an over-active imagination on the part of one of my
assistants i said but in view of what you have both
felt perhaps i was wrong about a year ago-by-
george exactly a year ago today i went on as i glanced
at the date of the report in my hand one of my assis-
tants told me that he had received a broadcast on an
extremely low wave length from an unknown station
he could not make out the words but it was something
about a mare a goat and a cobra i tried to verify his
report but i could not locate the station

  mariston looked at the report

  mare goat cobra he mused i cant see where
anything of that sort connects up with frank

  it is rather far-fetched i admitted but i wondered
if it were possible that getting only a few words as he
did that he might have only received a portion of the
ones he did get mare might be part of mariston and
cobra might have been cobalt but i cant connect the
goat

  that doesnt seem very probable said mariston
your receipt of a message by means of instruments
doesnt check up with our reception very well

  if it were any place other than troyana in question
i would lay the thing in the case of ray to hasheesh
which he admits he had and in your case to morbid im-
aginings i said however we all know that troyana
has means of communication that are different from any-
thing we knew of and they may be developing some
form of telepathy which accounts for it all of this
would tend to make me think strongly that frank is alive
i dont believe in spiritualism

  neither do i said willis although i have seen
some mighty funny things that i could tell you about


amazing stories

both in india and in egypt have you ever heard from
your mystery station again

   no i havent i replied i was trying at that time
in fact i am still trying to perfect something along the
line of the observation instruments that they had in
troyana i have made absolutely no progress along the
line of vision but i have developed a radio receiver that
picks up some of the lower harmonics of radio waves
it was with the first of these that my assistant heard or
thought he heard that message i have made better and
more powerful instruments since but i havent received
a word

  thats a might interesting start said mariston
would you mind letting us see them

   not at all i replied as i led the way into the sound
section of my laboratory and pointed out the apparatus

  mariston turned on the current and revolved one of
the dials

  youre way off i laughed you are on a much
shorter wave length than any station sends on let
me tune it

  mariston shook his head and looked again at the
year-old report that he held in his hand

  i am interested in that mystery station he said
we ought to hear from it tonight if ever

  why so  i asked

  because it is just a year since you last heard he
answered did you ever try to connect up the date
with anything that happened on our trip

  i thought for a moment and an idea flashed across
my mind i went to my desk and got out the diary
that i had kept during our trip

  youre right i said as i verified the date it
is exactly two years to a day since nankivell left us
and tried to make his way back

  exactly he replied energy is scarce in troyana
and he would have to conserve it it is natural that he
would pick out this as the date for making an attempt
for he would be sure that he would be more in our
minds on that day than any other

  greatly excited i turned to the receiver

  is that the instrument on which you heard him be-
fore asked willis

  no this is an improved model i answered
possibly you had better get the old one out he sug-
gested i am no scientist but it strikes me that there
might be something about that old instrument that made
it especially good for the purpose

  i assented and leaving mariston to play with the
new instrument i went into the storeroom and dug
out the older receiver it was a matter of ten minutes
work to get it connected up with batteries and fitted
with tubes i consulted the old report and set the dials
and clamped on a headset as i expected there was no
result

  let me take it suggested mariston

  i nodded and he approached to take the dial as he
did so i paused in the act of taking off the headphones
there were words or at least a murmur of words issu-
ing from them

  i replaced the headset on my head but the voice
stopped i cautiously lifted them again with no result

  what is it dune asked mariston his voice quiver-
ing with excitement

i dont know i replied i thought for a moment
that i had something but it must have been imagination
i surrendered my place to him and he began with in-

finite patience to turn the dials again and again he
ran over the gamut of the low wavelengths to the limit
of the receiver without result at last he gave up and
turned away giving the dial an idle twist as he did so
instantly his face froze in an expression of amazement

  my god dune he exclaimed in a whisper listen
 to this

  i took the phones from him and adjusted them but
 could hear nothing and said so he took them back and
 admitted that he could hear nothing himself i looked
 around and my attention was drawn by a restless move-
 ment on the part of willis

  i have it i exclaimed the position of our bodies
 must have been such as to give exactly the right capacity
 to the receiver to get that station through move up
 to where you were ray and bob you try to get in the
 same position

  for half an hour we squirmed around trying to re-
 establish the broken circuit suddenly mariston held
 up his hand

  im getting it fellows he whispered keep steady
 as you were

  he listened again and an expression of positive awe
 overspread his face

  what is it bob i whispered

   quiet he replied its nankivell

  willis and i involuntarily jumped forward

  now its gone he said get back in position ex-
 actly as you were

  five minutes more of squirming and he announced
that he had it he listened with rapt attention for some
time and then motioned me to take his place

  i did so and the process of establishing a balance had
 to be done all over again and again until the right posi-
 tion was attained

  i couldnt get any words except nankivell and that
 very indistinctly he said

  he moved in his chair as he spoke and i heard an
 indistinct murmur i motioned him to hold his position
 and began to move my hand about trying to bring it in
 clearer

  presently i made out a few words

  mariston bob mariston i heard faintly and dimly
 as though it were a voice from another world there
 was a pause and the voice spoke again dune oh dune
 ray willis this is   the voice faded and i had a
 good deal of trouble to bring it in again at last i
 heard a murmur and by dint of careful hand movements
 i brought it once more to audibility

  willis i heard this is frank nankivell i am-
 safe-but need-troyana- the voice faded again

  let me take it begged willis when i reported what
 i had heard

  dune knows more about it let him keep it said
 mariston try again dune this may be life or death
 to him

  for some time i could not get even a murmur but pa-
 tience was rewarded at last and i caught a few more
 words

  need cobalt i heard we need all the cobalt you
 can carry the passage that we came out is--

  damn i exploded as the voice faded out again
 another period of careful shifting of bodies followed and
 the voice came in again

  mariston it went on dune this-safe in troy-
 ana we are well-need cobalt bring all you can
 carry the master gives per-
the drums

of tapajos



there was a crash in my ears followed by a squeal
from the instrument i investigated and found that
a radiotron was burned out i hurriedly replaced it
but two hours of careful manipulation would not re-
store the delicate balance we had lost and we gave up
at length

  what do you make of it bob asked willis when
we had given up and were again seated in the laboratory
office

  if it were anyone but dune i would call it a trick
he replied

  its no trick i stormed

  keep your shirt on he laughed i can always get
a rise out of you i know that it wasnt a trick dune
taken with what i have experienced and what ray has
seen it leads me inevitably to one conclusion frank
is alive he won through to troyana despite the odds
against him and is beleaguered there and he needs cobalt
what is cobalt dune can you get it in new york

  very easily i replied it isnt especially rare

  is it bulky like feathers or is it heavy like iron
he asked

  its a metal i replied about like iron

  hum he said thoughtfully how much apiece do
you think we could pack ray 

  on iioseas road i would say twenty-five pounds
each or even thirty pounds at a pinch he answered

  carry i asked excitedly are we going back to
troyana

  mariston and willis exchanged glances

  no dune said mariston we arent but willis and
i are

  if you go i go i replied

  no you dont he answered

  i started to protest but willis silenced me

  now listen to reason dune he said in the first
place you are married and molly wouldnt let you go
while bob and i are footloose and go as we please with
no one to miss us except yourself in the second place
we cant hope to storm troyana by force well have
to sneak in and two are better than three at sneaking id
go alone but i am willing to risk bob for the sake of the
additional weight that he can carry but i wouldnt take
a chance on you bob is an old woodsman and you
arent in the third place bob and i have done nothing
much for the world and you are doing a lot the world
would miss you and it wouldnt miss us in the fourth
place bob is crazy to get back there to see balkis again
and i dont mind admitting that the place has attrac-
tions for me too in the fifth and last place bob and i
wont let you go

  my arguments did not move them nor did i persist
very hard in arguing after one look at mollys face when
she heard that i was thinking of going after all it
was a single mans adventure

  while they assembled their equipment i spent hours
in the laboratory trying to get another message but not
a sound could i hear i purchased the cobalt for them
fifteen pounds in blocks and an equal amount in sheets
rods and powder i did not know in what form frank
wanted it so i made up packages containing thirty

pounds for each of them assorting the material so that
each of them would carry each form the night before
they sailed for belem we held a final consultation

  i wish that we had got that message just a little
clearer remarked mariston as he conned for the
hundredth time the words that i had written down
some things are clear enough for instance we know
that he is safe in troyana and safety for him means
the sanctuary so that is our goal it is also clear that
we are bringing to him his principal need cobalt we
know or at least are sure that the master has given
us permission to return but i surely wish that we knew
the meaning of that phrase about the way we came out
is it blocked or open 

  its fifty-fifty replied willis i say take it it
was open and its the only way that we know except
through the city and ill bet my life that it isnt open

  thats exactly what you are betting said mariston
grimly your life and mine to boot however i agree
with you and well plan to take that route and then be
guided by circumstances

  molly and i bade them a sad farewell the next day
as the amaris pulled out from her dock and headed
down the harbor three months later i received a letter
from dom esteban enclosing one from mariston

  mariston told us that he and willis had arrived at
bacabal without trouble and were leaving for the in-
terior the next day taking three indians with them as
paddlers they had received no other word and were
as much in the dark as ever dom esteban described
their departure to us for he had accompanied them from
itaituba to bacabal to see them off he told us that the
men with them were good men one of them being
pedros son-in-law juan who was going along for the
express purpose of avenging pedros death he told
us that mariston and willis were in excellent spirits and
that if any men could live to conquer the terra prohibi-
tive twice that they were the men he promised to ad-
vise me at once of any news or rumors that reached him

  that letter was received over eighteen months ago
there is no need to detail the thousands that i have spent
or the hours that i have put in not only with the old
receiver that i heard nankivell on but on newer and
more powerful ones that i have developed going to
unheard of low wave lengths but my only result has
been with one exception the silence of the grave

  once indeed in the dead of night i heard or thought
i heard faint and distant the drumming of the hooves
of the golden calf the dreaded drums of tapajos
they faded almost instantly and i may have been mis-
taken if i did hear them what did they signify the
doom of my two friends and thus the doom of troyana
or the doom of amos and his cohorts i do not know
and i fear that i never will

  good old bob you of the level head and the true heart
you ray with the lion-like courage and the shrewdness
of the fox and frank-impulsive carefree lovable
frank nankivell where are you now and beautiful
heartless troyana-what is your fate only the gods
of troyana can answer and to me who heard the call
and did not respond they are silent-silent as the tomb

ct of rvetipuj

         by samuel garfinkel

just what effect is cosmic time likely to have on the atmosphere of this
s earth various predictions have been made by men of authority on this
subject changes are so slight that we in our human span of life can hardly
expect to notice them but what if some time in the dim future the change
becomes so great that it will definitely affect living conditions on the earth
in this short short story the author uses this theme to give a novel scientific
basis to retipuj how well he succeeds you can see for yourself

                        illustrated by wesso

on sunev threa   ruyerem arsm
 lay on his death-bed knowing that he had
i not long to live he ordered his servant to
call runtas sunaru i ruler of venus in
order to relate to his ruler an exceed-
ingly important tale which would aid in clearing a pro-
found mystery on venus the servant left in full haste
to summon this great personage upon his arrival arsm
extended to his ruler the courtesies of his home from his
death-bed

  he then bade his ruler to be seated breathing pain-
fully he began

  it is needless for me to tell you that i am unmarried
for that fact is fully known to you what you do not
know is that i am the last descendant of a family whose
name is next to yours in importance this name becomes
extinct with my passing you will soon i hope under-
stand why i assign my name such an honor when you
become thoroughly acquainted with this extraordinary
tale that i am about to relate to you it may sound to
you as if a madman were speaking yet it is nevertheless
true and will explain much that you would wish to know

  before beginning let me review for you something
which is already known to you and which this wonderful
narration will explain for the past quarter-century we
have attempted communication with earth without any
success this has been a puzzle to us because we have
already obtained answers from mars and jupiter the
earth is much nearer to us than are these two planets
causing the question to arise in our minds whether some
phenomenon is stopping our attempts we have been
trying to find out what this phenomenon might be with
little or no success the tale that i am about to relate
will explain why earth does not answer it has been
told from generation to generation in my family and was
told to me in my fathers own words as i am the last
of the arsm family and the story leaves me and goes
to you it is no longer an heirloom but should become a
legend

  this legend must go on so that all our children will
understand and appreciate all that has been done for
them by our friend retipuj

the tale follows

in the year  earth-time before an altar covered
with sparkling diamonds and plated with silver and
gold there kneeled an aztec indian who was fer-
vently praying to his sun god whose figure rose majes-
tically above the altar the indian looked to be no more
than twenty-five his hair was black and straight his
eyes were twin black wells that seemed to have some
mysterious depth above his eyes his eyebrows were
jet black long curved black lashes protected those
twin black wells his nose was straight and his mouth
was firm his herculean body rested upon legs that were
strong sturdy and agile his look was alert and he
showed a scholarly forehead he was six feet three
inches tall and was built straight as an arrow as he
kneeled and stretched his arms towards his god he began
to speak the moment the burning incense had reached
the height of his gods face

  oh mightiest of gods ruler of the sun hear
again my tale and rid me of this life full of pain and
torture today ends the thousandth year that i live on
this earth nine hundred years of pain and torture

  nine hundred seventy-five years ago i was proclaimed
as the greatest of astronomers because of the magnificent
and wonderful phenomena that rose before my peoples
eyes made visible through my discoveries one night
as i lay sleeping you came and spoke to me as follows

   retipuj for the discoveries you have made and for
your fertile brain and imagination i have chosen you for
a mighty task you shall live on this earth until you
have performed this task you will rescue all living races
from a disaster that threatens the world until that
time comes you are immortal and cannot die prepare
for this task by absorbing as much knowledge as you can
good-bye

  i awoke soon after to find myself in a cold sweat i
thought i had dreamed and so i laughed at this night-
mare it did not take long for me to find out my mistake
and to realize that you did really come and speak to me
five years afterwards i married and had children they
grew up to soon forget the knowledge i gave them dur-



 i
j as soon as the people arrived they were told to enter the projectiles where the stupendous
properties of thulerconium and the new power wrought a marvelous change upon them




amazing stories

ing all this time i did not neglect my chosen profession
of astronomy but became more completely versed in it
also i began studies in various scientific branches includ-
ing physics chemistry and prehistory

  soon i had passed my hundredth birthday to see my
parents and wife leave for that land where you rule in
person years passed and my heart healed but not for
long i saw all my friends go the way of my parents
and wife my children and their children i alone re-
mained immortal anguish seared my soul pain for
my beloved ones long dead shone in my eyes tears
of blood were in my heart while i remained dry-eyed
suffering in silence i prayed to you offered sacrifices
and burned incense every day but to no avail i was
doomed to live unwillingly the life you had given me
even though i tried all poisons guns and knives

  upon finding that i could not die i closed my eyes
to all pain and anguish and began to study for the task
you had set me i had learned all there was to learn
when you came to me a week ago and bade me go to this
altar to pray and burn incense this am i doing o
mighty one and now i await your word

   as he ended this tale and prayer retipuj put into each
burner more incense to replace that which was nearly
gone he bowed down until his head touched the floor
soon music was heard the body of retipuj stiffened
turned and lay still with face upward a soft gentle
voice that seemed to issue from the mouth of the idol
floated through the air its words were

  retipuj listen carefully to that which i say to you
because your mighty task is near when you awake you
will find yourself in an unknown land you will be in a
huge factory which will contain all the machines neces-
sary for your preliminary task outside you will find
three mines in each of these mine there is a different
metal yet unknown to earthmen extract the metals
from their ores purify them and form an alloy of all
three using the formula that you will find written upon
parchment and placed in your hand in the mines there
are just enough of the metals to form the required
amount of alloy when you have finished forming this
alloy you will begin to make the projectiles with which
you are to transfer all races to our neighboring planet
venus the alloy that you will form will have stu-
pendous properties after it is shaped into the projectile
and a certain power more powerful than any combina-
tion of rays and currents yet known on earth is gen-
erated to propel it how to make the generator for this
power and how to make the projectiles as well as the
knowledge of their stupendous properties you will find
already instilled into your brain by hypnotism

  i shall now explain to you what the impending dis-
aster is a century ago the atmosphere was composed of
 oxygen  nitrogen and about  inert gases
including carbon dioxide today unknown to the scien-
tists and due to the fact that all country lands have been
swallowed up by cities whose people have long forgotten
how to plant and how a tree looks the oxygen has
diminished to  the nitrogen remains at  as do
the inert gases at  while carbon dioxide has increased
to  the reason the oxygen has gone so slowly is
because the country only began disappearing during the
last half century people have forgotten how to plant
because their food is made in concentrated or synthetic
form from the primary constituents by scientists the
trees and vegetable life have given way to skyscrapers
that hold the hustling people who are slowly overcrowd-

ing the world war as you know has entirely ceased be-
cause there is only one infinitely contented class where
there is no distinction between east and west and only
one person rules the entire world

  within a few centuries the oxygen will entirely dis-
appear and in its stead will be  carbon dioxide be-
cause there will be no vegetable life to consume the car-
bon dioxide which is formed in a thousand and one dif-
ferent ways while the oxygen is being consumed con-
stantly by all animals and by many different combustions

  you now realize that life will become extinct if no
oxygen can be obtained to take the place of that which is
being used there is no way to replace this gas because
all its available compounds are being used to form the
concentrated foods to prevent the extinction of human
life it is necessary to transfer the people to a new
planet whose atmospheric conditions are favorable for
human life such a planet will venus be after i am
through working there

  while you are building the projectiles and genera-
tors i will be at work on venus in order to further its
evolution a few million years for today venus is as the
earth was these same few million years ago monsters
similar to those that lived during the earths reptilian
age roam and rage in the primeval forests of venus to
cause them to become extinct and to lower the heat of
the planet so that earthmen should be able to accustom
themselves to their immediate surroundings when they
arrive will be my task

  when you have finished the making of the projectiles
and generators i shall come to you again and give you
your final instructions for the salvation of humanity
until then retipuj good-bye

  as these last words were uttered the voice ceased and
the body of retipuj was encased in vapors when the
vapors had disappeared nothing of the body could be
seen at the altar or elsewhere it had vanished into thin
space

when ratipuj opened his eyes he found himself in
a fully equipped factory just as his god had told
him he would in his hand he found a parchment closely
written upon which gave him the necessary formula
outside he found the three mines spoken of to him while
in his trance immediately he began to mine the ores
extract the three metals purify them and finally alloy
them in their proper proportions to accomplish this
task took him the best part of fifty years inasmuch as
he was doing all this by himself and irrespective of all the
ultra-modern apparatus at hand when this task was
completed he began the building of the projectiles and
the generators for the new power with whose aid he was
to transfer earthmen to venus in order to save them
from the threatening disaster the projectiles were of
an enormous size being one hundred feet in diameter and
five hundred feet high their shape was very peculiar
and to describe these projectiles is very difficult it is
sufficient to say that the top end was circular and came
to a point as in a bullet while the end upon which each
projectile rested was hexagonal from one end to the
other the shape of each projectile blended from hexagon
to circle and from circle to hexagon never diminishing
nor increasing the diameter of one hundred feet all of
the projectiles machinery included were built of this
alloy which we will call thulerconium the generators
which were to furnish the unknown power were also built
of this alloy seven hundred of these projectiles could he
the act of retipuj



make before all of the thulerconium had been used up
to each projectile one generator was assigned the pro-
jectiles could not function without the aid of this gen-
erator the mechanism and machinery of the projectile
and generator were so intricate that not even the cleverest
of modern and ultra-modern scientists nor the most
learned men had the remotest understanding of their
construction to complete these projectiles and gener-
ators took him one hundred years

  upon the completion of this task he set about to build
an altar and an image of his god which took him a few
days upon the completion of the altar and god he
offered incense and prayed soon he fell into a trance
similar to his previous one and the voice of his god came
to him in order to give him his final instructions

  retipuj listen carefully to these your final instruc-
tions the people on earth will not be able to exist more
than fifty years longer on this planet my task on venus
is complete within ten years venus will be in conjunc-
tion with the earth on the night that you see a falling
star within a radius of sixty miles above you and you see
the moon divided by colors of red yellow and blue you
will know that the time has come for you to start the
flight to venus meanwhile notify the world of the im-
pending disaster through the medium of thought waves
of course this will be entirely new to them for no one
has ever attempted this practice your will power is
strong enough to perform this seemingly impossible
task it will take you about nine years to convince the
world of what you say if the worst comes to the worst
apply hypnotism you are on an uncharted island re-
cently placed on the earth through an upheaval of the
section around madagascar which has no more inhabi-
tants the tidal wave caused by this upheaval has wiped
that island clean this island upon which you are is only
three hundred miles from madagascar all the people
are to come to madagascar from which you will transfer
them to your island and immediately place them in the
projectiles when all the projectiles have landed on
venus i promise you that i will give you that which you
have so long sought for death until then do your
work faithfully and follow instructions carefully good-
bye retipuj you have your final instructions for this is
the last time i shall speak to you while you are alive

  the voice ceased and retipuj came out of his trance
immediately he set himself to his task every day at in-
tervals of three hours he sent out his warning telling of
the disaster and urging all to come to him papers be-
gan to speak of an unknown power that interrupted the
peoples thoughts at regular intervals and caused them to
think of an impending disaster vaguely to their minds
came the message and they seemed to know where to go
in order to escape this they had some thought of pro-
jectiles and venus although they were somewhat hazy on
that score steadily for nine years they felt these
thoughts each day the impulses were stronger the
papers attempted to scoff away these mysterious effects
by blaming the weather and the climate which seemed to
be slowly changing

  meanwhile as the years rolled by the oxygen dimin-
ished as the carbon dioxide increased scientists and
learned men soon discovered this through various tests
and began to diagnose the thought impulses that they had
been receiving all this time finally one man volunteered
for a service of research into this matter they soon
were able to record the impulses on a super-phonographic

plate which gave retipujs message to the world dur-
ing all this time the loss of oxygen began to put in its
deadly work the feeble began to die out tubercu-
losis became the most deadly of diseases the strong
began to wilt and panic began to reign the scientists
broadcast retipujs message to the world the message
besides explaining the thought impulses caused a stam-
pede for the island of retipuj ships submarines air-
planes every available trans-oceanic vehicle was seized
in this mad rush for freedom many failed to reach
the island due to death enough lived to fill all projectiles

retipuj during all this put all the interplanetary
 vehicles into shape he filled all projectiles with
enough food and drink to last all the people until venus
was reached the new power on decomposing fur-
nished the necessary oxygen for this great journey as
soon as the people arrived they were told to enter the
projectiles where the stupendous properties of thuler-
conium and the new power wrought a marvelous change
on them as each person set foot inside the projectile
he was diminished in size until just one foot high thus
many could enter each projectile

  all the projectiles were controlled by the one in which
retipuj had entered all were ready for the great ad-
venture the night that the last projectile was com-
pletely filled retipuj saw the signal of the falling star
and the colors on the moon which told him that venus
was in conjunction with the earth and that the time for
the flight had come upon seeing this signal retipuj
began the flight all generators worked in unison and
all vehicles shot simultaneously into the air going at a
moderate speed until safely out of the earths air
blanket when they presently attained a speed of 
miles per second which is equal to the velocity of light
an unusual incident awaited them upon venus

  as each vehicle came within the atmosphere of venus
its speed was reduced and it was sent in a different direc-
tion by retipuj so that all vehicles would scatter the
earthmen all around venus as each projectile struck
the ground the thulerconium decomposed and gently
wafted the people to the ground where they attained
their original height

  when the vehicle of retipuj decomposed those within
were pushed aside by an unknown force suddenly a
bolt from the sky shot past retipuj and ripped open a
big hole where he stood a second struck him causing
him to fall into the hole while a third covered the hole so
completely that the people who started looking for
retipuj could not discern as much as a scar on the ground
where he had last been seen he had gone to join his
fathers

  during all of the recital of this extraordinary tale
runtas sunaru had listened carefully as the tale ended
he sighed raycrem arsm looked up at his ruler

  you understand now why earth has not responded
and why the name of my family is important you also
know why this legend must go on in about fifteen
minutes i shall die swear to me that my words will not
go unheeded

  runtas sunaru made an avowal to immediately tell all
venerians this tale as the ruler finished this avowal he
gave ruycrem his hand to seal the vow ruycrem seized
it squeezed it once sighed contentedly and passed out of
this world called venus the name of arsm had be-
come extinct

   in the words of dr breuer
editor amazing stories

  permit me to commend your november num-
ber i am very much interested in your publica-
tion and it gives me genuine pleasure every time
you get out some good things ive never been an
editor and dont know how it feels but i rather
imagine that in these days of quantity production
and high pressure living and superficial achieve-
ment an editor of a sciencc-fiction magazine must
be up against it sometimes if he really prefers
literature to twaddle i judge that by the stuff
i read in the general run of scicnce-fiction maga-
zines as far as my own reading goes ninety per-
cent of present-day scicnce-fiction as a whole is on
about the same plane as the general run of wild
west and low-brow detective talcs i can imagine
the editor raising his hands to heaven and suppli-
cating providence to send him something with the
least bit of literary flavor in it

  the november number was good but two of
the stories appealed to me especially as a student
of the literary phases of sciencc-fiction one was
stanton a coblentz missionaries from the

sky heretofore i have preferred mr coblentz
if there is a doctor or a professor before
your name please indulge my ignorance of that
point popular-scientific essays and books to his
fiction up-to-date he has not taken into considera-
tion the fact that pure fantasy is not literature and
cannot appeal to the cultured reader his stories
have been largely untamed and unconfincd soarings
into the realms of scientific speculation without
the touch of realism that is demanded in modern
literature and with little interest in charactcr and
human motive but i like the missionaries
from the sky partly because it is short poe
was right many years ago he wrote that a long
literary work cannot be a work of art because
attention and emotion cannot be sustained for a
long time partly because it gives us drama con
flict of human motives and partly bccausc it
attains the atmosphere of realism without which
no sciencc-fiction story can be anything else than a
psychological document interesting to the psychiat-
rist who is studying the mental state of the writer
but to no one else mr coblentz has the scientific
background i rejoice very much to see him also

developing the literary touch all i know about
him is what i gather from reading his stories in
this magazine and all i say is based on such read-
ing and on nothing else come again mr cob-
lentz with a short one with real people and a con-
vincing atmosphere

  the other is jack williamsons the cosmic
express i have been intensely interested in
jack williamson ever since i made his literary
acquaintance though his first story showed
chiefly promise of future possibilities yet the
promise was there i have hoped that he would
realize that real lovers of literature cannot possibly
be interested in the play of rays on some distant
asteroid or the conflict of imaginary monsters that
strained ones receptive imagination i have hoped
that he would understand that the only thing that
the readers of the ages arc interested in is people
what they are but especially what they do i
knew he would do it some day and he has done
it in the cosmic express in this story he has
worked out one of the principal raisons detre of
sciencc-fiction the effect upon human nature and

always outside of things
-thats where i was just
twelve short months ago
i just didnt have the
cash that was all no
theatres no parties no
good restaurants no real
enjoyment of life i was
just getting by just ex-
isting what a difference
today i drive my own
car have a good bank
account enjoy all the
amusements i please

i couldnt get the good things of life

then  quit my job and found myself

how does a man go about making
more money if i asked myself
that question once i asked it a hun-
dred times

  i know the answer now-you bet i
know the way good money is made and
im making it gone forever are the days
of cheap shoes cheap clothes walking
home to save carfare pinching pennies to
make my salary last from one pay-day to
the next one i own one of the finest
radio stores you ever saw and  get al-
most all the radio service and repair work
in town the other radio dealers send
their hard jobs to me so you can see how
i stand in my line

  but-its just a year ago that i was a
poorly paid clcrk i was struggling along
on a starvation salary until by accident my
eyes were opened and i saw just what was
the matter with me heres the story of
just how it happened

  one of the big moments of my life had
come i had just popped the fatal ques-
tion and louise said yes

  louise wanted to go in and tell her
father about it-right away so we did he
sort of grunted when we told him the
news and asked louise to leave us alone
and my heart began to sink as i looked
at his face

  so you and louise have decided to get
married he said to me when we were
alone well bill just listen to me ive
watched you often here at the house with
louise and i think you are a pretty good
upstanding young fellow i knew your
father and mother and youve always had
a good reputation here too but let me
ask you just one question-how much
do you make

  twenty-eight a week i told him

  he didnt say a word-just wrote it
down on a piece of paper

  have you any prospects of a better job
or a good raise some time soon  he asked

  no sir i cant honestly say that i
have i admitted im looking for some-
thing better all the time though

  looking eh how do you go about
it

  well that question stopped me

  how did i i was willing to take a
better job if i saw the chance all right but

i	certainly had laid no plans to make
such a job for myself when he saw my
confusion he grunted i thought so he
said then he held up some figures hed
been scribbling at

  ive just been figuring out your fam-
ily budget bill for a salary of twenty-
eight a week ive figured it several ways
so you can take your pick of the one you
like best heres budget no  i figure
you can afford a very small unfurnished
apartment make your payments on enough
plain inexpensive furniture to fix such an
apartment up pay your electricity gas and
water bills buy just about one modest out-
fit of clothes for both of you once each
year and save three dollars a week for
sickness insurance and emergencies but
you cant eat and youll have to go with-
out amusements until you can get a good
substantial raise in salary

  i began to turn red as fire

  that budget isnt so good after all he
said glancing at me maybe budget no

	will sound better-

  thats enough mr sullivan i said
have a heart i can see things pretty
clearly now things i was kidding myself
about before let me go home and think
this over and home i went my mind
in a whirl

  at home i turned the problem over and
over in my mind id popped the question
at louise on impulse without thinking it
out everything mr sullivan had said was
gospel truth i couldnt see anything to do
any way to turn but i had to have more
money

   i began to thumb the pages of a maga-
zine which lay on the table beside me
suddenly an advertisement seemed almost
to leap out at my eyes an advertisement tell-
ing of big opportunities for trained men to
succeed in the great new radio field with
the advertisement was a coupon offering a
big free book full of information i sent
the coupon in and in a few days received
a handsome -page book printed in two
colors telling all about the opportunities in
the radio field and how a man can prepare
quickly and easily at home to take advan-
tage of these opportunities i read the book
carefully and when i finished it i made
my decision

  whats happened in the twelve months
since that day seems almost like a dream
to me now for ten of those twelve months
ive had a radio business of my own at
first of course i started it as a little prop-
osition on the side under the guidance of
the national radio institute the institu-
tion that gave me my radio training it
wasnt long before l was getting so much
to do in the radio line that i quit my

measly little clerical job and devoted my
full time to my radio business

  since that time ive gone right on up al-
ways under the watchful guidance of my
friends at the national radio institute they
would have given me just as much help too
if i had wanted to follow some other line of
radio besides building my own retail busi-
ness such as broadcasting manufacturing
experimenting sea operating or any one of
the score of lines they prepare you for and
to think that until that day i sent for their
eye-opening book id been wailing i never
had a chance

  now im making real money louise and
i have been married six months and there
wasnt any kidding about budgets by mr
sullivan when we stepped off either ill
bet that today i make more money than the
old boy himself

  heres a real tip you may not be as bad
off as i was but think it over-are you
satisfied are you making enough money
at work that you like would you sign a
contract to stay where you are now for the
next ten years making the same money  if
not youd better be doing something about
it instead of drifting

  this new radio game is a live-wire field
of golden rewards the work in any of the
 different lines of radio is fascinating ab-
sorbing well paid the national radio in-
stitute-oldest and largest radio home-
study school in the world-will train you
inexpensively in your own home to know
radio from a to z and to increase your
earnings in the radio field

 human action of material progress and the reac-
 tion of the one upon the other science is here
 apparently to stay human nature is here and al-
 ways has been what is going to be the result of
 the presence of this new thing only come among
 us yesterday scientific and industrial progress
 philosophers can tell us perhaps but how much
 better can the fiction-writcr tell us and mr
 williamson certainly caught the note this time
 i was surely glad to see it mr williamson and i
 hope you do it again

   now i surmise that the readers of the magazine
 arc thinking that instead of wasting his time on
 long letters like this dr breuer ought to get to
 work and write a story of the type that he wants
 to see so badly i agree but it isnt so easy the
 kind appreciation of my work that has appeared in
 these pages has done a great deal to encourage me
 and stimulate me to further effort and i think any
 time that i spend in the praise of the work of
 other authors will be well spent perhaps some
 of them will be urged to produce the magnum opus
 that we arc always looking for

                        miles j breuer md

                                    lincoln neb

    mr coblentz has established his status with our
 readers definitely as a great favorite we are sure
 that none of our authors study out their stories
 more carefully than mr coblentz studies his if
 in the printing even a single word is changed he
 is apt to detect it and this he really did once to
 our knowledge so we feel that his work has a spe-
 cial interest in being so carefully studied out mr
 williamson is also a great favorite with our
 readers interplanetary stories have acquired a
 great popularity and many of our readers like
 oliver twist are asking for more it is said that
 comparisons are odious so we will say nothing
 comparative about the fiction from dr brcuers
 pen with which we have been favored in the past
 he is a most painstaking writer and when he de-
 parts from the field in which he has won for him-
 self a distinguished name he has his work gone
 over in some cases by some special experts to
 verify his data and conclusions we arc more
 than pleased to publish this most interesting letter
 from doctor breuer and we can assure him that
 his commendations of our work are very highly
 appreciated by us and if he has followed our dis-
 cussions columns he will see how highly his work
 in the field of fiction has been appreciated by our
 readers all we can say is that if mr coblentz
 and mr williamson are not delighted with such
 a letter as this they are lacking in the happy qual-
 ity of appreciation-editor

an appreciation of the skylark
stories and of interplanetary
stories in general

 editor amazing stories

    i have just finished reading the october issue of
 amazing stories and i want try to express to
 you my appreciation of the story of skylark
 three

 i have been reading amazing stories ever
 since it was first published and i am also reading
 the other science fiction magazines that are on
 the newsstands but i have never yet come across
  that could beat skylark of space pub-
 in your magazine in  it was mar-

comments from a printer who is
also a devoted reader or
amazing stories

 editor amazing stories

    in writing this letter to you i want to say that
 what i know about science would fit in a pinhead
 but i am always interested in learning more i
 must admit i read your magazine more for the
 fiction in it than the scientific data

   being a printer etc myself i wish to add my
 comments to the steadily increasing volume of let-
 ters that i believe that you must receive

   the paper that you use in your magazine is of
 a fairly good quality and i can see that you
 have eliminated gloss i believe to insure more
 comfort for the readers eyes am i not right
 also i believe that your stock is of thicker than
  lb basis which of course is a fine thing
 frankly you could have reduced the cost of your
 magazine by making it the smaller size that usually
 designates trashy stories but you did not and i
 believe that your magazine has achieved a higher
 point in my estimation i would like to say
 though that although the paper you use now is
 of a fair quality you might increase the quality
 of your magazine to a higher point

    for comments on the stories in the august issue
 the skylark of space was a very fine story and
 if i can help it there will be several more people
 reading the second instalment the mystery of
 prof brown was good for a story of its length
 but i would not waste space for these i could
 not even push through south polar beryllium
 ltd i couldnt get anything from it world
 atavism was fine and more of these would be
 heartily endorsed by myself the last war
 and when inca-land revolted were fine also
 and stories like these will always be acceptable to
 your readers

   i have read your magazine a lot and to show
 you how much i enjoy it when i was at camp
 last summer i walked  to  miles to the nearest
 town to get it

                       earle w newton

               tompkins st cortland n y

   a glossy paper while it may be very good from
 a mechanical standpoint is certainly trying to the
 eyes especially in these days of high powered elec-
 tric lights we do not like to reduce the size of
 the magazine pages we feel that that would im-
 pair its appearance and might put it in a class
 where we would be sorry to see it you must re-
 member that the title amazing stories has now
 had a life of several years and we feel that it
 would be very bad judgment to abandon it
 scientifiction is a coined word and certainly is not
 a good english language expression you are one
 of many that admires the skylark of space
 stories other readers however have liked the
 stories which you do not care for-editor

   now i am looking around for a word to express
 my appreciation for skylark three but i cant
 find any it is by far the best that i have ever
 read as for the other stories in your magazine
 some arc good and some are not so good but it is
 pretty hard to please everybody and i think you
 are doing very nicely as it is

   my particular brand of stories are interplane-
 tary stories and give us more of them if you can
 i also would appreciate it if you could get dr
 smith to write another story about skylark
 three having them visit other galaxies far beyond
 ours where their enemies were bound before they
 destroyed them

                           w h hynes

                                fairview st
                                   sydney n s

   our correspondent is one of many who have
 admired the skylark stories the editors of
 the magazine have felt sometimes that they were
 giving too many interplanetary stories but there
 is such a field of romance and excitement to be
 found in imaginings of the great world about us
 that the subject seems to elicit the best that is in
 them from our authors we are sure that dr
 smith will give your last suggestions due con-
 sideration we esteem him very highly as one of
 our authors-editor

the first unfavorable criticism
of skylark three

  editor amazing stories

  the current oct issue of the pioneer and best
  science fiction magazine published amazing
  stories is one of the best issues yet published

  i placed the stories according to merit in the
  following order

  	man who saw the future

  	the man from the moon

  	dynasty of the blue-black rays

  	the prince of liars

  	skylark three

  the man who saw the future was a surpris-
  ing change from hamiltons usual type-ie
  earth threatened by invaders etc

  the man from the moon is one of the most
  dramatic and touching stories i ever read the
  end is peculiarly fitting and brings the tale to a
  triumphal close

 skylark three was terrible however-
 one mans meat is another mans poison

  really no comment can be made upon amazing
  stories it has reached the peak of perfection
  the layout for the nov issue looks good it capt
  be anything else with authors such as meek
  coblentz starzl keller williamson and pratt
  indeed it seems as if the november number will
  be an all-star number

                              e anderson

 southern boulevard new york n y

     your short letter is quite interesting your
  selection of stories you will find differs from that
  of others of our readers and the terrible sky-
  lark three as you term it has been praised
  greatly by numbers of our correspondents who
  we believe would put it at the head of the list
  instead of at the foot as you do-editor

a suggestive letter

 editor amazing stories

   possibly i would have kept putting off my
 writing to discussions forever if i had not
 noticed a mistake in the october issue of our
 magazine it is this

   in the story the dynasty of the blue-black
 rays by milton r peril tcnta raci the leader
 of the incan band asks what century is this
 and is answered by one of the explorers the
 twentieth possibly mr peril has the notion that
 the incas dated their years from the birth of
 christ i doubt that they ever heard of christ
 until the coming of pizarro and the spaniards
 maybe they reckoned their dates by the year of
 the rulers reign however i am not an authority
 on this and i can leave it to mr verrill or
 some other ethnologist to explain this but they
 certainly didnt know what the twentieth century
 was the explorer most likely should have ans-
 wered the eight-hundredth since the accession
 of manco capac it would have been more en-
 lightening to the marooned incans

    the rest of the october issue was excellent-
  each issue surpasses the last first in my pref-
  erence list comes the conclusion of skylark
  three the science and adventure fairly took
  my breath away tell dr smith not to stop but
  to keep on with his wonderful stories next comes
  the story the prince of liars it is mr han-
  sens best it is told in such a queer and yet
  plausible way that one-half believes and half dis-
  believes it next in my estimation is the man
  from the moon by otis adclbert kline this
  story is a sort of prelude to maza of the moon
  which appeared in argosy last winter the other
  stories were up to the amazing stories standard

   the best novel that has appeared in amazing
 stories to date in my opinion is skylark
 three the best novelette the green splotches
 and the best short story madness of the
 dust my favorite authors are dr smith r f
 starzl t s stribling a merritt john w
 campbell jr and isaac r nathanson please
 give us more of these authors

   about reprints how about giving us one
 serial reprint a year for us hungry reprint fans
 i would suggest running garrett p servisss novel
 the conquest of mars as the first if this is
 absolutely impossible please try printing them in
 paper-bound books at about c apiece i hope
 that any reprint fans that want this will write in
 and endorse my proposition

    interplanetary stories as you may notice are
  my dish i cant get too much of them ill
  stick to amazing stories as long s you keep
  publishing them if you are thinking of publish-
  ing amazing stories as a semi-monthly why
  dont you instead write two magazines-amazing
  stories to be published about the first of the
  month and interplanetary stories to be pub-
  lished on the th i bet a shirt that within three
  years there will be an interplanetary stories on
  the market grab the title while the getting is
  good

    for the benefit of the curious who wonder what
  kind of moron wrote this letter i will state that
  i am sixteen years old a junior in high school
  and have a deep interest in astronomy chemistry
  and scicntifiction i have read amazing stories
  since when it was first published and have a com-
  plete library of it so i believe that i have a fair
  right to comment on it

    with best wishes to the foremost of scientific
  fiction magazines

   the incas of the story you refer to at the
 beginning of your letter might be supposed to be
 conversant with the reckoning of the christian
 calendar even though they may have been sup-
 posed to have used the inca calendar for their
 own purpose but wouldnt the explorer have
 made a mistake if he had said as you make him
 say that eight hundred centuries or  years
 have elapsed since the accession of manco capac
 you have made a very good selection of favorite
 stories and favorite authors we wish you could
 see the manuscripts now on file with us if you did
 sec them you would realize why we rather avoid
 giving reprints in your fondness for interplane-
 tary stories you figure as one of many your let-
 ter shows that you are many degrees removed

the rating of the stories in our

november issue-mr campbell
to be heard from

editor amazing stories

  here is your monthly brickbat and bouquet
from yours truly re the november issue i
think i have already written about the october
issue

  the drums of tapajos capt s p meek-
first third as usual captain meek is up to his
usual high standard hope the second and third
thirds are as good-dare not hope they are better
-else he will be equalling dr e e smiths
skylark masterpieces

  globoid terror-r f starzl in my esti-
mation the title is misleading-very little is men-
tioned about the globoid looks to me like merely
the usual villain-hero-heroine type of story with
practically no science-or should i say super-
science really far below your usual standard for
stories

  pineal stimulator i s stephens and
fletcher pratt very good i rate it along with
capt meeks short stories in previous issues

  missionaries from tho sky s a coblentz
very good will he write or has he written a
sequel he ought to-after having the martians
all ready-actually entering their balloon suits-
for their journey of conquest over the earth-and
we could have another war of the planets but
lets hope it will be somewhat different

  cosmic express jack williamson a four-
star story except for one thing which reduces it
to a two-star tale that being the hero and the
heroine took no food-no matches-no arms they
went at it too casually to be true to life to be
as really interesting as jack usually writes

  solarite-john w campbell jr i saved it
to the last purposely in this letter as i want you
to tell j w c jr of a couple of mistakes he
made which would have ruined the story were he
not the excellent author he is first page -
read the paragraph beginning in the right hand
column objects could pass right through us just
as they passed through the air as long as we
were transparent-only opaque objects were
susceptible-all ok so far-except-page 
-line  to -arcot dropped a can of luminous
paint on the enemy plane which was transparent
the same as the author had the solarite-you re-
member objects passed right through while it was
in the same state as the enemy plane page 
-l h column- lines from top the beginning
of the address who made this address part
seemed to be by arcot-part by the venerian or
the venerians which was it who made this
error the author or did your printer leave out
part-also on page -preceding the address
referred to- the venerian speaks-you have
little gold and platinum-and morlus is unknown
-in token of our appreciation we present this
small disc of morlus to each of you how come
mr campbell did not finish the thought he started
and have the venerians load down the solarite
with gold and platinum he evidently meant to
have his venerians do so but overlooked it until
way at the end of the story where the trend of
thought had been broken-now a few pieces of
gravel to go along with the heavy masonry i have
cast the captured enemy plane-why was it not
used in the fight-how did he communicate with
the kaxorians by radio when he was not sure they
had a radio system-judging by the lanorians not
having one as stated-not positively-on page 
-l if column th to nd lines speaking of
invisibility-could not arcot have interfered with
the enemys invisibility quite as easily by elec-
trical vibrations as the enemy did with his own-
rather than bring in the luminous paint also
how did the luminous paint spread to cover such
a large surface in so small a quantity and so
short a time another thing as andy says to
min-isnt it the theory that the suns heat is not
radiated through free space but that its light is
some way rectified into heat after reaching the
earth or its atmosphere else why the supposedly
intense cold of free space theoretically also
-if the solarite received its energy by means of
collector discs-which must face the sun-what
happened to this supply of energy when avoiding
a meteorite with the discs away from the sun
also on these sudden turns at the enormous speed
of around  mp sec-well-remember the 
mp hour aeroplane it speaks well for j w c
jrs writing ability that even with these errors
and discrepancies i stiil can rate his story at three
stars

  wont you call j w c jrs attention to the
last paragraph above please i mean all this
for sincere constructive criticism-not destructive
for i really like his stories

  it is evident from your letter that you are
one of our most assiduous readers we publish
this letter with great pleasure as it indicates that
you take our work and we can assure you that
is the proper name for it so seriously it is a
very serious business with the editorial staff the
editors have been with amazing stories from
its first issue and you can imagine what a pleasure
it is to find a reader who takes it so seriously as
you do mr campbell has received so much praise
for his stories that there is danger that his head
will be turned as the proverbial expression has
it and your letter cutting two stars off his line
of decoration we are sure will do him a lot of
good he is young enough to learn and we arc
sure he will take your letter in the right spirit
-editor

a tribute to the discussions col-
umns criticizing our best
authors condemned

editor amazing stories

  i am a comparatively new reader of amazing
stories having been introduced to its pages in
 until now i have been merely an interested
looker-on in the discussions column having never
taken part in the numerous controversies which
have originated there nevertheless i intend to
write numerous letters to you in the future as i
find it to bo a very enjoyable and fruitful occupa-
tion and by the way i think that jack darrow
is one of the most ardent science-fiction fans in
the country he is one of the steadiest contribu-
tors to your discussions column and also to the
columns of other science-fiction magazines will
mr darrow accept the humble congratulations of
another fan send me a letter sometime mr
darrow and i will return the favor

  i am glad that our magazine does not waste
precious space on science-news and other use-
less articles devote al available space to discus-
sions which i consider one-third of amazing
stories value in regard to reprints i think
it would be a good idea to publish these in the
form of small booklets

  never print more than one interplanetary story
in each issue they are probably the most popular
type of science-fiction but quite undesirable the
stories by scptama are without doubt the very best
interplanetary novels

  i was quite astounded when one correspondent
condemned several of the best authors we have
the idea of criticizing dr keller and a hyatt
verrill

   i believe that a contest to determine the three
best authors would be very interesting my choice
would be

  	jack williamson

   	stanton a coblentz

  	dr m j breucr

  the first author has captivated me his imagi-
nation rivals that of a merritt and in my opinion
he is a better scientist than merritt coblentz t
admire because of some of the wonderful novels he
has written in the past the sunken world was
a masterpiece he very cleverly interweaves
science and fiction the last author is so well
known and universally admired that it is hardly
necessary to explain why i admire him he is
original and his short stories have a philosophical
touch

  why not a few stories by philip knowlan e r
burroughs francis flagg a merritt and jules
verne although vernes stories may be slightly
antiquated i still think that they are very good
science-fiction

   the editors cannot tell you how pleased they are
with your view of the discussions column we
have a definite desire to make these columns a
very distinctive and important part of our maga-
zine we are sure that our readers enjoy this
section and enjoy writing for it we will give
full consideration and indeed have been doing so in
the past to the idea of publishing reprints in the
shape of booklets and we certainly hope that cir-
cumstances will enable us to do this sometime in
the near future before seeing your letter we
had in mind the restriction of the stories of inter-
planetary adventure so as to give plenty of other
matter we definitely agree with the implication
in your letter that dr keller and a hyatt ver-
rill are among our best writers we would un-
hesitatingly put them among your three favorites
thereby increasing the number to five you were
right in saying that dr breuer is universally
admired we consider him one of the best-

an interesting letter from a new

zealand girl amazing stories
in the antipodes

 editor amazing stories

   i note in the correspondence column of your
 april  issue a letter from a reader in
 glasgow well here is a letter from an even
 more distant reader so distant that it has taken
 me from november until now to find a store where
 i may obtain your magazine regularly should this
 store fail me i shall probably be sending you an
 sos for a supply direct from you

   to date i have read only your november and
 april issues but these have been sufficient to make
 me eager to miss no more and  must add that
 i have never been able to say this of any othes
 journal

   the outstanding feature of your publication
 seems to me that your stories always provide food
 for thought and speculation also they are cleverly
 written and bear witness to exhaustive scientific
 knowledge  the part of your authors it is a
 pleasure indeed to hear from such men

    i notice that some of your correspondents criti-
 cize your stories for their improbability but to
 me this is their chief virtue so many impossi-
 ble theories of the th century arc now familiar
 established facts that one must hesitate to condemn
 anything impossible today as impossible for all
 time and if we do not visualize these impos-
 sible things how can we ever attain to them
 there must be always a goal and i have there-
 fore no adverse criticism for your magazine re-
 garding it rather as a stimulus to the progress of
 man

   interplanetary stories have a great appeal for
 me they open up a delightful field of conjecture
 although i hope that our first overtures towards our
 neighbors are not met with the hostility usually
 portrayed by authors i liked the metal horde
 for its idea of interplanetary friendship

   cold light i enjoyed it seemed to hang to-
 gether so well also the brain accelerator and
 conquest of the earth

   the green girl of which i have read only
 part ii was interesting and well written i liked
 the account of the manufacture of nitroglycerine
 under difficult conditions

   i would like particularly to congratulate your
 authors upon the clarity of exposition of their
 theories some of these theories are set forth
 most convincingly and in such fashion that each
 step of reasoning involved may be clearly followed

    i would like to read some more about the fourth
 dimension may i mention that i found most in-
 teresting the letter from mr frank brueckel jr
 published in your april columns re the einstein
 theory of relativity and the godesic flyer i
 have not read the story in question but found mr
 brueckels letter ample compensation personally
 i am more interested in the science than in the
 fiction

   as for myself i am eighteen years of age and
 a girl but even this last fact does not impair my
 enjoyment of your journal when i have read
 more of your issues and have had an opportunity
 to become more familiar with your authors i
 would like to write to you again and perhaps ask a
 few questions as for criticism-well i am no be-
 liever in this realizing that your selections arc
 carefully and wisely made but i certainly have
  use at all for destructive criticism con-
 structive criticism has its value though do you not
 think

   well i am now awaiting your next issue
 rather eagerly and certainly wish you every
 success

   please acccpt apologies for the length of this
 letter but it is my first

   anyhow you have certainly linked up with new

   it is always a pleasure to get a good letter
 from the antipodes-a letter which has traveled
 about half way around this sphere of ours the
 precise object of our publication is to provide
 food for thought and speculation as you very justly
 express it it  quite difficult to secure from au-
 thors of fiction the due mixture of romance and
 adventure with science the questionnaire which
 we publish in each issue you must not take as being
 complete a good scientific fiction story will give
 food for thought in many directions and a dozen
 questions cannot be supposed to cover the points
 in natural science ill our magazine where so much
 is implied that may not be expressed definitely in
 words it certainly is dangerous as you say to
 pronounce things to be impossible in the field of

a criticism of baron munchhausen
from australia

editor amazing stories

  i have read your magazine for some time and
consider that by far the most interesting thing
about reading amazing stories is picking out the
little scientific flaws in some of the stories for
this reason i consider your discussions section
one of the most interesting features of your maga-
zine i know many of your readers dislike this
type of criticism but they must remember that
such critics are not condemning the stories they
deal with personally the more flaws i find in a
story the better i like it and i know that it is
the same with many other readers

   i have not noticed lately any criticisms of the
mathematics of any of the stories you have printed
although some authors are particularly careless in
this field take our friend baron munchhausen
i must apologize for resurrecting back numbers
but really the chance is too good to miss

  	the barons space flyer has for its motive
power the moons gravity alone the trip to the
moon only takes  hours but in practice it would
be impossible to accomplish the trip in less than
xe days under the given conditions as mathe-
matical reasoning readily shows the return trip
would take  days but that is another matter

  	the baron begins to retard his space flyer
when  miles from the surface of the moon
using the earths gravitational attraction this
is impossible as the gravitational attraction of the
earth near the moon is th of its value on
the earths surface and in the distance named
could only produce a retardation of about 
miles per hour so that the space flyer would
crash into the moon with a velocity of  
miles per hour assuming it to travel at 
miles per hour before retardation as it would
have to do

  the baron took  minutes to fall right
through the moons center in actual practice he
would take  minutes it is not hard to see the
barons error here he used the time honored
formula s -li a t- and put oacceleration at
moons surface calculation actually docs give
about  minutes but really this single equa-
tion is no longer valid as a is not constant
throughout as munchhausen assumed it de-
creases as we approach the moons center having
zero value there this problem is insoluble with-
out the aid of the calculus as is also the first
problem

  apparently mr gernsback does not count among
his accomplishments a knowledge of higher mathe-
matics hence his errors i have enclosed the
solutions of these problems to support the asser-
tions made in this letter there may be arithmeti-
cal mistakes but i have gone over them care-
fully i hope you accept this criticism in the
friendly light i offer it

                          cotham road

kew victoria australia

  you must remember that the adventura of
baron munchhausen as written by mr gerns-
back constituted a simple fiction tale and the
mathematics were not supposed to be beyond criti-
cism the problem of what a mass would do
falling through a hole going completely through the
moon or the earth and passing through its exact
center has often been thought over and presents
rather an amusing topic when we think of the
body oscillating back and forth as it gradually
approaches rest it is gratifying to an editor to
see the interest that is taken in the work of his
contributors-editor

an inspiring letter from a
schoolboy in the irish
free state

 editor amazing stories

    this is september and i am just reading the
 april number i saw in the discussions corner
 a letter from a seottie and thought that you
 might like to hear the opinion of a paddy like
 the seottie i get my amazing stories at wool-
 worths stores here in cork first about the
 authors edmond hamilton dr keller and jack
 williamson are strong favorites with me i have
 no special favorite as they are all so good i
 think that there is no artist to beat wesso as his
 pictures are all absolutely marvelous and i ad-
 mire his fertile imagination sincerely if wesso
 left a s it would be almost a tragedy re-
 garding your cover i think that there is not a more
 attractive cover on the whole bookstand i think
 that the paper could be improved a bit although
 i think that it has improved lately i wish that
 i could be assured of getting a s regularly
 i actually read the may number before i got the
 april number i thought that the universe
 wreckers was a fine story even if it was strained
 a little too far out of the ordinary the gimlet
 was a bit of a bore not because it was a very
 foolish story but because it was written in
 language too advanced for the average layman-
 reader before i forget it i want to say morey
 about that cover why did i neglect to say some-
 thing about morey before if he can draw a
 beautiful design like that on the april number he
 is worthy of as much praise as wesso by the
 way were the andromcdans made of metal or
 what if i sent you - which is about three
 dollars and fifty cents could i get a years sub-
 scription to a s as i am still at school i
 dont see such a sum very often but i am going
 to get it as a christmas present as i have always
 wished for a years subscription to amazing
 stories well mr ed i suppose i may see
 my letter in the october or november number
 which i hope to get about march or april  i
 hope that your great magazine will eventually be-
 come as well known and popular in europe as it
 is in the u s a and may the a s authors
 and artists continue the good work without a break
 for many another long year

    you will get amazing stories regularly if
 you will subscribe thereto the subscription price

human interest in science
stories

 editor amazing stories

    i intended to write last month about that sci-
  cnce-action controversy but forgot it but it was
  recalled when i read globoid terror by r f
  starzl i agree absolutely with starzl in this
  matter of mixing adventure action and romance
  with science a pure science story is like an air-
  plane without a motor in it it takes human
  interest to make it go

    this man starzl deliberately puts himself in the
  way of trouble i think by being too modest to
  read his letters youd think his stories are very
  weak on science in truth they are stronger than
  the average at any rate one can swallow his
  scientific statements without gagging a story may
  be full of scientific gibberish and still be less sci-
  entific than one of starzls adventure yarns be-
  cause so much of the science aint so john
  w campbell writes a scientific story that is
  believable r f starzl writes a different style
  entirely and his story also is believable because
  the science is good and enjoyable because it has
  the quality of a true short story

    yours for good and better fiction

                          louis stephenson

                                 arapalive okla

    you have made a good selection from among
 our authors but do not forget that there are oth-
 ers it is interesting to note how differently
 readers are affected some like you approve of
 mixing romance and science in stories some
 would leave romance out and you hit the mark
 in what you say about the quality of a true
 short story-quality is what counts-editor

 good stories spoiled by a miscon-
 ception of the reader

 editor amazing stories

    having read your magazine ever since it came
 out i feel that i have a right to ask you at least
 one question-namely how can a so-called rocket
 ship propel itself after reaching the void existing
 between the planets as near as i can under-
 stand this void is a perfect vacuum therefore
 frictionless and of no resistance whatever to light
 rays this being granted what can the explosive
 force of a rocket be exerted against to propel
 the rocket ship this question in my mind spoils
 otherwise good stories for me where rocket ships
 arc involved i can more readily conceive a ship
 being propelled by gravity-repelling rays or bet-
 ter still magnifying the gravity of another body
 much larger than the earth to such an extent that
 the earthly gravity could be overcome personally
 i think that in some far future date this will
 be done for it seems to me that science once
 setting a goal generally reaches it i have no
 criticism to make of your magazine i enjoyed
 skylark three very much and really hated to
 see it draw to a close

    our advice to you is to prevent what we call
 otherwise good stories from being spoiled for j
 you study newtons laws of motion with a i
 special reference to action and reaction and you
 will find that a rocket would go much faster and
 with less expenditure of power in a vacuum than
 it would in air and that the propelling gaies will
 push harder against it in a vacuum than if it
 was in air the presence of air diminishes the
 propelling action of the gases issuing from the
 rear nozzles it makes them push as it were with
 less force against the rocket than if they were in
 the vacuum of space so you neednt let stories
 be spoiled for you by this misconception of yours

reprints in our magazine

 editor amazing stories

   your cover on the august issue is the best one
 i have seen this year it might scare away some
 of the ultra-conservatives but i think it is the
 kind that will attract more new readers than it
 will lose old ones why not have that kind every
 month  incidentally it was drawn by wesso
 while the ones preceding and succeeding were
 drawn by morey i cant understand why you
 dont let wesso draw all the covers he is far
 superior to your other artists but although the
 cover in question was unusually brilliant and at-
 tractive it contained an obvious scientific error
 which should never have passed the editorial
 desk can it be that the editor is not aware
 that there would be at least a few stars visible
 in outer space while i have not been able to find
 even one on the aforementioned cover illustra-
 tion on the subject of illustrations i am glad
 to note that the august copy contained one draw-
 ing by paul and the september was adorned with
 three it is my fervent hope that you will get
 paul back as art director

   the message from space was the most in-
 teresting story in the july edition which was
 above par itself a hyatt verrill is just as
 good at humorous stories such as a visit to
 suari as lie is in yarns of deeper themes
 world atavism was a very unusual story as
 all of edmond hamiltons are and although his
 stories admittedly contain the faults mentioned
 by arthur ostrander their originality and the
 breath-taking action more than offset these bad
 features in the may issue you published mad-
 ness of the dust by r f starzl here is an
 author of more than ordinary ability try to get
 some more stories from him

   now that all that is over i will get down to
 the real reason for writing this letter it is my
 humble aim to chastise mr kirschner for his in-
 considerate and heartless attack on victor a
 endersby mr endersby is an educated man
 and a deep thinker his stories are highly con-
 centrated food for thought and if they arc not
 appreciated it is the readers fault also after
 criticizing one part of mr kirschners letter i
 very strongly desire to augment another of his
 opinions i would like very much for you to
 print several of the old favorites which many of
 us missed in booklet form this would answer
 your argument against reprints and i am sure
 that many of your readers feel the same way
 about it that i do i am asking all the readers
 who missed the moon pool the face in the
 abyss the skylark of space and numerous

others to write in and show the editor the con-
sensus of opinion it is bitter medicine for us
to have to read a multitude of letters praising
these stories and know that wfe will never be
able to read them ourselves

  before closing i want to thank the editor for
the most interesting editorial that i have ever
had the pleasure to read i am referring to the
one about the atom and the stars which ap-
peared in the september copy it explained many
things which i had not clearly understood about
the quantum theory and the new wave-mechanics
theory of the atom i suppose this is right in the
editors line being himself an instructor in
chemistry hoping you will consider printing
the classics

yours very truly

wayne d bray

  if our correspondents could sec the number
of stories on our shelves awaiting publication
they would not be surprised at our giving so few
reprints stories by favorite authors keep coming
in we micht wish we had twice the space to
give them which is now at our command the
quantum theory in a broad sense may be taken to
apply to the general disconuity of things its
most usual application is perhaps to energy but
matter is made up of its own quanta or bricks
as for the visibility of stars in space if at what
may be called an interstellar distance from a
sun or luminous star presumably the stars would
be seen your criticism we think is a good one
for it must be perpetual night out in space we
arc glad you enjoy mr starzls stories we think
he has done some remarkable work-editor

 a letter of criticism from a
friendly reader
editor amazing stories

  i am taking this liberty of writing you a letter
on a subject which i believe is vital to a publi-
cation such as yours it is originality in plot

  when a s was first launched on the stands
it was an original idea in periodicals it caught
the publics attention and held it-but in my esti-
mation is wearing off why some time back
a reader wrote in discussions that he had read
the first few issues of the magazine and then be-
coming fed up on interplanetary travel atomic
energy etc he had stopped reading the book for
several months picking an issue up at a later
date he was pleased to find new plots and original
themes perhaps you can see here what im
driving at

  now honestly admit it how much longer
do you think your publication will last if you
keep up what you have been doing for a long
time namely giving us stories with the same
old plots ideas and murderous scientists the
other science-fiction magazines have the same fail-
ing the readers are treated to an original idea
only once in a blue moon some one said that it
was extremely difficult to think up an entirely new
theme it is hard but i have tried it and have
thought about eight entirely new themes i dont
think that your magazine can survive another ten
years if you give interplanetary talcs with the
same old wars and weary old formulas a good ex-
ception is the skylark of space atomic energy
is in it too but it is so different from the others
that it was welcomed with a great shout of
relief and a general clamor for a sequel its
sequel skylark three shows so many original
ideas in the very first installment that id e
willing to wager that another shout for another
sequel arises good old dr smith he realizes
that a change is a good tonic

  you may think im exaggerating when i say
that every science-fiction magazine seems to be
on the brink of the downward path but i mean
just what i say what is needed the tired
business man who secs day in and day out the
same old scencs and sights gets a tip from his
md to give himself a treat to new scenes thats
what all science-fiction magazines need new ideas
not carbon copies of something that somebody
has written before that is all i have to say on
this matter mr editor and i wonder what you
have to say

  there is something in my mind which has
bothered me -since the september  issue
it is why doesnt h g wells appear any
more true you published his lord of the
dynamos since that month but it covered a very
small amount of space in my opinion it is mr
wells who pul amazing stories on its feet by
that i mean that a person who picked up an
issue for the first time was attracted to the
magazine by the name of h g wells more than
if he had just looked at the cover illustration
the magazine needed somebody to advertise
whether or not the stories were just filthy trash
-amazing stories-or talcs worthy of being read

over and over again mr wells name cov-
ered that point all of which brings nre to this
statement i and almost everybody in the brook-
lyn scientific club and other outsiders want
the stories of mr wells where they belong-
in a s

  and how about jules verne for the last two
years you gave us several stories of his in the
first part of the year how about this year
brighten your pages with the hunt for the golden
meteor and the southern cross you might even
add the green ray

  by this time you must have the idea that im
writing this in kings county insane hospital but
i assure you that i am writing this because i want
a s to rise to unequalled heights so stick
around for a few more lines

  another science-fiction magazine seems to get
all that ray cummings writes how about you
a s should give its readers the same treat get
ray cummings for several issues and hell he
unable to write the sequels as quickly as they are
demanded by the way what chance of letting
tubby go in a new trip around the universe
it seems a shame to let tubby stay where he is
and not come into the open once more get ray
cummings to read this-but then there must be
hundreds of thousands before me trying to tell
him the very same thing cummings has some-
thing new in his stories and i enjoy his cute
short sentences also

  hurray  the sequel to the face in the
abyss has been finished-but alas and alack
i hear of no mention of amazing stories in
connection with it if you havent already heard
of it heres the name it is the snake mother
good old a merritt i

  well thats all ive got to say except that
vanishing movies by teddy holman is still miss-
ing if this appears to be just a bit too critical
just remember that i have penned it for the
good of your worthy magazine

           isidore manzon  myrtle ave

brooklyn n y

  this letter tells its story so clearly that com-
ment is not needed we wish you could re-
alize the demand which exists for interplanetary
stories it would almost justify an interplanetary
monthly they ore a favorite topic with camp-
bell and he receives the highest praise from our
readers it may interest you to know that dr
smith is one of our new authors he wishes to
write only when the spirit moves him we have
been criticized unfavorably for reprints from mr
wells and jules verne criticize all you feel
inclined to-the editor realizes that it is good for
him to be in close touch with his readers-

some conjectures about gravita-
tion-the possibility of an
associated force

editor amazing stories

  in re miss baldwins very sensible letter in
discussions for august i respectfully state that
one part of the conclusions is open to doubt-or
else the newtonian and elnsteinian laws of
gravitation arc all wet

  reasons

  a	apogee and new moon do not coincide on
each cycle as her fifth paragraph requires

  in january  apogee fell about  ra
before new moon in august at full moon

  b	as that acceleration means greater cen-
trifugal force it is additional to solar attraction

  c	the solar attraction if as strong as stated
would pull the moon away regardless of where the
center of gravity lay

  which brings me to the idea which has been
growing on me

  gravitation is cither much more powerful than
the physicists and astronomers claim or else-

  an associated like or primary force works with
it to hold the solar system as a balanced unit

  of the two hypotheses i definitely favor the
second in my opinion gravitation is a more
or less local action of a much more powerful force
of generically-like nature it is far too weak
according to newtonian theorem to hold our earth
in its orbit but we are here rather firmly
held too

  in the letter of miss barbara baldwin winch
was published in our august  issue pp -
 and to which letter you refer there appears
to be an attack on the astronomy expounded by
harl vincent wc wonder how miss baldwin will
feel when she reads your letter we will leave it
in the hands of fate to see what happens be-
tween you and miss baldwin with perhaps the
addition of harl vincent-editor

this is what the whirlwind carbureting device does for d r gilbert enough of a
saving on just one trip to more than pay the cost of the whirlwind

the whirlwind saves notorists

  miluons of dollars yearly

      whirlwind users reporting the results of their tests are amazed at the results they are getting letters keep streaming into the office
 idling of mileages all the way from  to  miles on a gallon resulting in a saving of from  to  in gas bills alone

      mark h estes writes i was making  miles to the gallon on my pontiac coupe today with the whirlwind i am making   miles
 to the gallon am i glad i put it on ill say so

      	p p- gorzcn wries i made an actual test both with and without a whirlwind getting a miles without and   miles with the
 whirlwind or a gam of  miles lo the gallon the longer the whirlwind is in use on the machine the better the engine runs has more pep
 and quicker starting it makes a new engine out of an old one and starts at the touch of the starter button

      r j tulp the whirlwind increased the mileage on our ford truck from  to  miles to gallon and  in speed we placed
 another on a wiuys-knight and increased from  to  miles per gallon

       arthur grant i have an oakland touring car that has been giving me  miles to the gallon average but i can see a great difference with
 the whirlwind as it climbs the big hills on high and gives me better than  miles to the gallon of gas which is better than h saving in gas

      w a scott i had my whirlwind for three years winter and summer it gives the same perfect service inslant starting smoother
 running and what i saved in gasoline these last few years has brought other luxuries which i could not have afforded previously

      car owners all over the world are saving money every day with the whirlwind besides having better operating motors think what
 this means on your own car figure up your savings-enough for a radio-a bank account-added pleasures why let the oil companies profil
