good chemists command high salaries

           and you can make yourself

           yet undiscovered secrets

                         your imagination and make you want to sail the uncharted
                         seas in search of treasure and adventure and then you
                         would regret that such things were no longer done but that
                         is a mistake they are done-today and everyday-not on
                         desert islands but in the chemical laboratories throughout
                         your own country quietly systematically the chemist works
                         his work is difficult but more adventurous than the blood-

plausibility in scientifiction

hugo gernsback

by

e are pleased to reproduce the following letter
which was received from one of our readers
editor amazing stories 

    i have just finished reading the august
issue of amazing stories and venture to
make a few suggestions which might help
to improve the magazine in the future although in my
opinion amazing stories is one of the most interest-
ing fiction magazines published some of the stories have
such obvious scientific mistakes in them that they seem
more like fairy tales than scientifiction and conse-
quently appear to be out of place in your magazine

    for example even admitting the possibility of a
  fourth dimension as set forth in murray leinsters
  the runaway skyscraper a little reasoning would
  prove that any timepiece contained in the building at
  the time of slipping into the fourth dimension would
  not run backwards but instead would continue for-
  ward as did all other machinery also several other
  authors in transporting their characters from one planet
  to another have never considered the difference of
  bacterial life upon these worlds which would speedily
  cause the death of any visitors who arrived on a new
  planet without first having acquired immunity from the
  ravages of its organisms

    as an example of an excusable error i might cite the
  one in high tension by albert b stuart where the
  ligaments were able to stand up under the great strain
  exerted upon them by the highly stimulated muscles

    as a closing suggestion i think that the magazine
  would be greatly improved if scientific anecdotes or
  paragraphs containing information which would in-
  crease the plausibility of stories in past or present issues
  were set between the various stories

sincerely yours

                        signed w f crist

  it is a pleasure to receive letters of this kind because they
indicate that our readers are intensely interested in the type
of fiction which wc publish and also that the stories are
given serious consideration this is a wholesome sign and
we can only say that such correspondence is most welcome
when the magazine is enlarged which will be very soon
there will be a special department wherein letters of this
nature will be printed and discussed

  regarding the statement contained in the above letter
permit us to say that a writer of scientifiction is privileged
to use poetic license the same as is the writer of any other
fiction story there is rarely a story of this type so perfect

as to pass muster with all of its facts the general theme
and many other points

  for example even in the best-written fiction stories you
will notice the characters converse in rather extraordinary
language this is the so-callcd fiction language and is
not generally used in real life open almost any first-class
magazine and if you stop to think for a second you will
realize that human beings do not use the flowery language
that the characters do in fiction the same is true of scien-
tjfiction in another respect where authors often take poetic
license sometimes disregarding true scientific facts although
still retaining enough scientific accuracy to make the plot
or story seem probable and at the same time interesting

  referring to murray leinsters the runaway sky-
scraper our correspondent is probably correct as to the
timepieces but why pick on the timepieces if we grant
the fourth dimension we will have to grant the rest of the
-to us-queer things supposed to exist on this higher plane
and if we do not grant any then wc had better not read the
story at all because of the assumption that a century
of time can run backwards the author naturally must make
everything run backwards

  as to the criticism of bacterial life on other worlds we
believe it was h g wells who first pointed out this danger
in transporting living creatures from one world or planet to
another but at best this only is a theory there is nothing
known about bacterial life in other worlds but it is certain
that if explorers ever will travel from one planet to another
this will be taken into consideration and they will be in-
noculatcd just as travelers now arc innoculatcd when travel-
ing from northern to tropical zones and vice versa

  but why stop at the bacterial danger there may be far
more deadly things experienced in travelling from one planet
to another than we know of today professor millikans
researches recently showed for example that his cosmic
ray wljich seems to abound in extra-terrestrial space is far
more deadly than anything we know of he has found that
the cosmic ray can pierce solid lead six feet in thickness
whereas the ordinary x-ray which is itself deadly enough
is stopped by a thin sheet of lead the harm which these
rays might do to an interplanetarian traveler we arc loath
to think of what they might be for instance on the moon
makes one shudder because the moon having no atmosphere
any poor human being would probably be killed immediately
if he had not some sort of protection which today has as
yet not been invented or even thought of

                                                             we disagree with our correspondent as to the strength of
                                                             the ligaments in high tension wc believe the story
                                                             of the highly-stimulated muscles to be scientifically correct
                                                             a medical authority vouches for the general accuracy of the
                                                             statements of thestory

 a columbus of space

author of the moon metal
introduction

  what is here set down is the fruit of long and
careful research among disjointed records left by
survivors of the terrible events described the
writer wishes frankly to say that in some in-
stances he has followed the course which all his-
torians are compelled to talce by using his imagina-
tion to round out the picture but he is able

conscientiously to declare that in the substance of
his narrative as well as in every detail which is
specifically described he has followed faithfully the
accounts of eye-witnesses or of those who were in
a position to know the truth of the wonderful events
which they related

the second deluge

         by garrett p serviss

chapter i

cosmo versal

n undersized lean wizen-faced man
with an immense bald head as round
and smooth and shining as a giant soap-
bubble and a pair of beady black eyes
set close together so that he resembled
a gnome of amazing brain capacity and prodigious
power of concentration sat bent over a writing
desk with a huge sheet of cardboard before him
on which he was swiftly drawing geometrical
and trigonometrical figures compasses t-squares
rulers protractors and ellipsographs obeyed the
touch of his fingers as if inspired with life

  the room around him was a jungle of terrestrial
and celestial globes chemists retorts tubes pipes
and all the indescribable apparatus that modern
science has invented and which to the uninitiated
seems as incomprehensible as the ancient para-
phernalia of alchemists and astrologers the walls
were lined with book shelves and adorned along
the upper portions with the most extraordinary
photographs and drawings even the ceiling was
covered with charts some representing the sky
while many others were
geological and topogra-
phical pictures of the face
of the earth

  beside the drawing-
board lay a pad of paper
and occasionally the little
man nervously turned to
this and grasping a long
pencil made elaborate cal-
culations covering the
paper with a sprinkling
of mathematical symbols
that looked like magnified
animalcules while he
worked under a high light
from a single window placed well up near the ceil-
ing his forehead contracted into a hundred wrink-
les his cheeks became feverous his piercing eyes
glowed with inner fire and drops of perspiration
ran down in front of his ears one would have
thought that he was laboring to save his very soul
and had but a few seconds of respite left

  presently he threw down the pencil and with
astonishing agility let himself rapidly but care-
fully off the stool on which he had been sitting
keeping the palms of his hands on the seat beside
his hips until he felt his feet touch the floor then

he darted at a book-shelf pulled down a ponderous
tome flapped it open in a clear space on the floor
and dropped on his knees to consult it

  after turning a leaf or two he found what he
was after read down the page keeping a finger on
the lines and having finished his reading jumped
to his feet and hurried back to the stool on which
he mounted so quickly that it was impossible to
see how he managed it without an upset instantly
he made a new diagram and then fell to figuring
furiously on the pad making his pencil gyrate so
fast that its upper end vibrated like the wing of
a dragon-fly

  at last he threw down the pencil and encircling
his knees with his clasped arms sank in a heap
on the stool the lids dropped over his shining
eyes and he became buried in thought

  when he reopened his eyes and unbent his brows
his gaze happened to be directed toward the row
of curious big photographs which ran like a pic-
tured frieze round the upper side of the wall of the
room a casual observer might have thought that
the little man had been amusing himself by photo-
graphing the explosions of fireworks on a fourth
of july night but it was evident by his expression

that these singular pic-
tures had no connection
with civic pyrotechnics
but must represent some-
thing of a most pro-
nounced fatal and stu-
pendous import

  the little mans face
took on a rapt look in
which wonder and fear
seemed to be blended
with a sweep of his hand
he included the whole ser-
ies of photographs in a
comprehensive glance and
then setting his gaze up-
on a particularly bizarre object in the center he be-
gan to speak aloud although there was nobody to
listen to him

  my god he said thats it that lick
photograph of the lord rosse nebula is its very
image except that theres no electric fire in it
the same great whirl of outer spirals and then
comes the awful central mass-and were going to
plunge straight into it then quintrillions of tons
of water will condense on the earth and cover it
like a universal cloudburst and then good-by to
the human race-unless-unless-i cosmo versfcl

 professsor garrett p serviss needs no in-
  troduciion to you after you have read a columbus
 of space but here the well-known scientist-author has
 hit upon the effects created upon modern humanity by a
 second deluge it is an impressive tale and not a
 whit more improbable than the first noachian deluge of
 biblical days only the setting is modern and the second
 great ark is of course vastly different from that used
 by noah then of course there are a great many other
 things in the second deluge that noah never even
 dreamt of and that surely never happened to him what
 these things are you will find out by reading this entranc-
 ing classic


amazing stories

inspired by science can save a remnant to repeople
the planet after the catastrophe

  again for a moment he closed his eyes and
puckered his hemispherical brow while with drawn-
up knees he seemed perilously balanced on the high
stool several times he slowly shook his head and
when his eyes reopened their fire was gone and a
reflective film covered them he began to speak
more deliberately than before and in a musing
tone

  what can i do i dont believe there is a moun-
tain on the face of the globe lofty enough to lift
its head above that flood hum hum its no use
thinking about mountains the flood will be six
miles deep-six miles from the present sea-level
my last calculation proves it beyond all question
and thats only a minimum-it may be miles deeper
for no mortal man can tell exactly whatll happen
when the earth plunges into a nebula like that

  well have to float thats the thing ill have
to build an ark ill be a second noah ill ad-
vise the whole world to build arks

  millions might save themselves that way for
the flood is not going to last forever well get
through the nebula in a few months and then
the waters will gradually recede and the high
lands will emerge again but itll be an awful long
time i doubt if the earth will ever be just as it
was before there wont be much room except for
fish-but there wont be many inhabitants for what
dry land there is

  once more he fell into silent meditation and
while he mused there came a knock at the door
the little man started up on his seat alert as a
squirrel and turned his eyes over his shoulder
listening intently the knock was repeated-three
quick sharp raps evidently he at once recognized
them

  all right he called out and letting himself
down ran swiftly to the door and opened it

  a tall thin man with bushy black hair heavy
eyebrows a high narrow forehead and a wide
clean shaven mouth wearing a solemn kind of
smile entered and grasped the little man by both
hands

  cosmo he said without wasting any time on
preliminaries have you worked it out

  i have just finished

  and you find the worst

  yes worse than i ever dreamed it would be the
waters will be six miles deep

  phew exclaimed the other his smile fading
that is indeed serious and when does it begin 
inside of a year were within three hundred
million miles of the watery nebula now and you
know that the earth travels more than that distance
in twelve months

  have you seen it

  how could i see it-havent i told you it i in-
visible if it could be seen all these stupid astrono-
mers would have spotted it long ago but ill tell
you what i have seen

  cosmo versals voice sank into a whisper and
he shuddered slightly as he went on

  only last night i was sweeping the sky with the
telescope when i noticed in hercules and lyra and
all that part of the heavens a dimming of some

of the fainter stars it was like the shadow of the
shroud of a ghost nobody else would have noticed
it and i wouldnt if i had not been looking for it
its knowledge that clarifies the eyes and breeds
knowledge joseph smith it was not truly visible
and yet i could see that it was there i tried to
make out the shape of the thing-but it was too
indefinite but i know very well what it is see
here-he suddenly broke off-look at the photo-
graph he was pointing at the lord rosse
nebula on the wall its like that only its com-
ing edgewise toward us we may miss some of the
outer spirals but were going to smash into the
center

  with fallen jaw and black brows contracted
joseph smith stared at the photograph

  it doesnt shine like that he said at last
  the little man snorted contemptuously

  what have i told you about its invisibility
he demanded

  but how then do you know that it is of a watery
nature

  cosmo versl threw up his hands and waved
them in an agony of impatience he climbed upon
his stool to get nearer the level of the others eyes
and fixing him with his gaze exclaimed

  you know very well how i know it i know
it because i have demonstrated with my new spec-
troscope which analyses extra-visual rays that all
those dark nebulae that were photographed in the
milky way years ago are composed of watery vapor
they are far off on the limits of the universe this
one is one right at hand its a little one compared
with them-but its enough yes its enough you
know that more than two years ago i began to cor-
respond with astronomers all over the world about
this thing and not one of them would listen to me
well theyll listen when its too late perhaps

  theyll listen when the flood-gates are opened
and the inundation begins its not the first time
that this thing has happened i havent a doubt
that the flood of noah that everybody pretends to
laugh at now was caused by the earth passing
through a watery nebula but this will be worse
than that there werent two thousand million peo-
ple to be drowned then as there are now

  for five minutes neither spoke cosmo versal
swung on the stool and played with an ellipsograph
joseph smith dropped his chin on his breast and
nervously fingered the pockets of his long vest at
last he raised his head and asked in a low voice
what areyou going to do cosmo

  im going to get ready was the short reply
  how

  build an ark

  but will you give no warning to others

  ill do my best ill telephone to all the officials
scientific and otherwise in america europe africa
asia and australia ill write in every language
to all the newspapers and magazines ill send out
circulars ill counsel everybody to drop every other
occupation and begin to build arks-but nobody will
heed me youll see my ark will be the only one
but ill save as many in it as i can and i depend
upon you joseph to help me from all appear-
ances its the only chance that the human race has
of survival
the second deluge



  if i hadnt made this discovery they would all
have been wiped out like miners in a flooded pit
we may persuade a few to be saved-but what an
awful thing it is that when the truth is thrust
into their very faces people wont believe wont
listen wont see wont be helped but will die like
dogs in their obstinate ignorance and blindness
but they will they must listen to you said
joseph smith eagerly

  they wont but i must make them replied
cosmo versal anyhow i must make a few of
the best of them hear me the fate of a whole race
is at stake if we can save a handful of the best
blood and brain of mankind the world will have
a new chance and perhaps a better and higher race
will be the result since i cant save them all
ill pick and choose ill have the flower of human-
ity in my ark ill at least snatch that much from
the jaws of destruction

  the little man was growing very earnest and his
eyes were aglow with the fire of enthusiastic pur-
pose as he dropped his head on one side it looked
too heavy for the stemlike neck but it conveyed an
impression of immense intellectual power its
imposing contour lent force to his words

  the flower of humanity he continued after a
slight pause who composes it i must decide
that question is it the billionaires is it the
kings and rulers is it the men of science is it
the society leaders bah ill have to think on
that i cant take them all but ill give them all
a chance to save themselves though i know they
wont act on the advice

  here he paused

  wont the existing ships do-especially if
more are built joseph smith suddenly asked in-
terrupting cosmos train of thought

  not at all was the reply theyre not suited
to the kind of navigation that will be demanded
theyre not buoyant enough nor manageable
enough and they havent enough carrying capacity
for power and provisions theyll be swamped at
the wharves or if they should get away theyd be
sent to the bottom inside a few hours nothing
but specially constructed arks will serve and
theres more trouble for me-i must devise a new
form of vessel heavens how short the time is
why couldnt i have found this out ten years ago
its only to-day that i have myself learned the full
truth though i have worked on it so long

  how many will you be able to carry in your
ark asked smith

  i cant tell yet thats another question to be
carefully considered i shall build the vessel of this
new metal levium half as heavy as aluminum and
twice as strong as steel i ought to find room with-
out the slightest difficulty for a round thousand in
it

  surely many more than that exclaimed joseph
smith why there are ocean-liners that carry
several times as many

  you forget replied cosmo versal that we
must have provisions enough to last for a long
time because we cannot count on the immediate
reemergence of any land even the most mountain-
ous and the most compressed food takes space when
a great quantity is needed it wont do to over-

crowd the vessel and invite sickness then too
i must take many animals along

  animals returned smith i hadnt thought of
that but is it necessary

  absolutely would you have less foresight than
noah i shall not imitate him by taking male and
female of every species but i must at least provide
for restocking such land as eventually appears above
the waters with the animals most useful to man
then too animals are essential to the life of the
earth any agricultural chemist would tell you
that they play an indispensable part in the vital
cycle of the soil i must also take certain species
of insects and birds ill telephone professor herge-
schmitberger at berlin to learn precisely what are
the capitally important species of the animal king-
dom

  and when will you begin the construction of the
ark

  instantly theres not a moment to lose and
its equally important to send out warnings broad-
cast immediately there you can help me you
know what i want to say write it out at once
put it as strong as you can send it every where
put it in the shape of posters hurry it to the news-
paper offices telephone in my name to the car-
negie institution to the smithsonian institution
to the royal society to the french russian
italian german and all the other academies and
associations of science to be found anywhere on
earth

  dont neglect the slightest means of publicity
thank heaven the money to pay for all this is not
lacking if my good father when he piled up his
fortune from the profits of the original trans-
continental aerian company could have foreseen
the use to which his son would put it for the bene-
fit-what do i say for the benefit nay for the
salvation-of mankind he would have rejoiced in
his work

  ah that reminds me exclaimed joseph smith
i was about to ask a few minutes ago why air-
ships would not do for this business couldnt peo-
ple save themselves from the flood by taking refuge
in the atmosphere

  cosmo versal looked at his questioner with an
ironical smile

  do you know he asked how long a dirigible
can be kept afloat do you know for how long a
voyage the best airplane types can be provisioned
with power theres not an airship of any kind
that can go more than two weeks at the very utter-
most without touching solid earth and then it must
be mighty sparing of its power if we can save
mankind now and give it another chance perhaps
the time will come when power can be drawn out of
the ether of space and men can float in the air as
long as they choose

  but as things are now we must go back to
noahs plan and trust tc the buoyant power of
water i fully expect that when the deluge begins
people will flock to the highlands and the mountains
in airships-but alas that wont save them re-
member what i have told you-this flood is going
to be six miles deep

  the second morning after the conversation be-
tween cosmo versal and joseph smith new york


amazing stories

was startled by seeing in huge red letters on every
blank wall on the bare flanks of towering sky-
scrapers on the lofty stations of airplane lines on
billboards fences advertising-boards along subur-
ban roads in the subway stations and fluttering
from strings of kites over the city the following
announcement

the world is to be drowned

save yourselves while it is yet time

drop your business it is of no consequence

build arks it is your only salvation

the earth is going to plunge into a watery
nebula there is no escape

hundreds of millions will be drowned you have
only a few months to get ready

mocking at fate

when new york recovered from its first
astonishment over the extraordinary post-
ers it indulged in a loud laugh every-
body knew who cosmo versl was his eccentrici-
ties had filled many readable columns in the news-
papers yet there was a certain respect for him
too this was due to his extraordinary intellectual
ability and unquestionable scientific knowledge
but his imagination was as free as the winds and
it often led him upon excursions in which nobody
could follow him and which caused the more steady-
going scientific brethren to shake their heads they
called him able but flighty the public at times
called him brilliant and amusing

  his father who had sprung from some unknown
source in southeastern europe and beginning as a
newsboy in new york had made  his way to the
front in the financial world had left his entire
fortune to cosmo the latter had no taste for
finance or business but a devouring appetite for
science to which in his own way he devoted all
his powers all his time and all his money he
never married was never seen in society and had
very few intimates-but he was known by sight
or reputation to everybody there was not a
scientific body or association of any consequence
in the world of which he was not a member those
which looked askance at his bizarre ideas were glad
to accept pecuniary aid from him

  the notion that the world was to be drowned
had taken possession of him about three years be-
fore the opening scene of this narrative to work
out the idea he built an observatory set up a labora-
tory invented instruments including his strange
spectroscope which was scoffed at by the scientific
world

  finally submitting the results of his observations
to mathematical treatment he proved to his own
satisfaction the absolute correctness of his thesis
that the well-known proper motion of the solar
system was about to result in an encounter be-
tween the earth and an invisible watery nebula
which would have the effect of inundating the globe
as this startling idea gradually took shape he com-
municated it to scientific men in all lands but failed

to find a single disciple except his friend joseph
smith who without being able to follow all his
reasonings accepted on trust the conclusions of
cosmos more powerful mind accordingly at the
end of his investigation he enlisted smith as secre-
tary propagandist and publicity agent

  new york laughed a whole day and night at
the warning red letters they were the talk of the
town people joked about them in cafes clubs at
home in the streets in the offices in the exchanges
in the street-cars on the elevated in the subways
crowds gathered on corners to watch the flapping
posters aloft on the kite lines the afternoon news-
papers issued specials which were all about the
coming flood and everywhere one heard the cry
of the newsboys extra-a-a drowning of a
thousand million people cosmo versal predicts
the end of the world on their editorial pages
the papers were careful to discount the scare lines
and terriflc pictures that covered the front sheets
with humorous jibes at the author of the formid-
able prediction

  the owl which was the only paper that put the
news in half a column of ordinary type took a
judicial attitude called upon the city authorities to
tear down the posters and hinted that this absurd
person cosmo versal who disgraces a once honored
name with his childish attempt to create a sensation
that may cause untold harm among the ignorant
masses had laid himself open to criminal prose-
cution

  in their latest editions several of the papers
printed an interview with cosmo versal in which
he gave figures and calculations that on their face
seemed to offer mathematical proof of the correct-
ness of his forecast in impassioned language he
implored the public to believe that he would not
mislead them spoke of the instant necessity of con-
structing arks of safety and averred that the pres-
ence of the terrible nebula that was so soon to
drown the world was already manifest in the hea-
vens

  some readers of these confident statements began
to waver especially when confronted with mathe-
matics which they could not understand but still
in general the laugh went on it broke into boister-
ousness in one of the largest theaters where a
bright-witted artist who always made a point of
hitting off the very latest sensation got himself
up in a lifelike imitation of the well-known figure
of cosmo versal topped with a bald head as big as
a bushel and sailed away into the flies with a pretty
member of the ballet whom he had gallantly snatch-
ed from a tumbling ocean of green baize singing
at the top of his voice until they disappeared behind
the proscenium arch

         oh th nebula is coming
         to drown the wicked earth

         with all his spirals humming
         s he waltzes in his mirth

chorus

            dont hesitate a second

           get ready to embark

           and skip away to safety
           with cosmo and his ark
the second deluge



         th nebulas a direful bird
         s he skims the ether blue

hes angry over what hes heard

ns got his eye on you

chorus

dont hesitate a second etc

         when nebulas begin to pipe
         the bloorain ilo

          ybet yer life the time is ripe
          to think what you will do

chorus

dont hesitate a second etc

hell tip th atlantic oer its brim

and swamp the mountains tall

hell let the broad pacific in

and leave no land at all

chorus

dont hesitate a second etc

hes got an option on the spheres

hes leased the milky way

hes caught the planets in arrears

ns bound to make em pay

chorus

dont hesitate a second etc

the roars of laughter and applause with which
this effusion of vaudeville genius was greeted show-
ed the cheerful spirit in which the public took the
affair no harm seemed to have come to the ignor-
ant masses yet

but the next morning there was a suspicious
change in the popular mind people were surprised
to see the new posters in place of the old ones more
lurid in letters and language than the original the
morning papers had columns of description and
comment and some of them seemed disposed to
treat the prophet and his prediction with a certain
degree of seriousness

the servants who had been interviewed overnight
did not talk very convincingly and made the mis-
take of flinging contempt on both cosmo and the
gullible public

naturally the public wouldnt stand for that and
the pendulum of opinion began to swing the other
way cosmo helped his cause by sending to every
newspaper a carefully prepared statement of his
observations and calculations in which he spoke
with such force of conviction that few could read
his words without feeling a thrill of apprehensive
uncertainty this was strengthened by published
despatches which showed that he had forwarded his
warnings to all the well-known scientific bodies of
the world which while decrying them made no
effective response

and there was a note of positive alarm in ai
doubled-leaded bulletin from the new observatory at
mount mckinley which affirmed that during the
preceding night a singular obscurity had been sus-
pected in the northern sky seeming to veil many

stars below the twelfth magnitude it was added
that the phenomenon was unprecedented but that
the observation was both difficult and uncertain

  nowhere was the atmosphere of doubt and my-
stery which now began to hang over the public so
remarkable as in wall street the sensitive cur-
rents there responded like electric waves to the new
influence and to the dismay of hard-headed ob-
servers the market dropped as if it had been hit
with a sledge-hammer stocks went down five ten
in some cases twenty points in as many minutes

   the speculative issue slid down like wheat into a
bin when the chutes are opened nobody could
trace the exact origin of the movement but selling-
orders came tumbling in until there was a veritable
panic	 

  from london paris berlin vienna leningrad
flashed dispatches announcing that the same unrea-
sonable slump had manifested itself there and all
united in holding cosmo versal solely responsible for
the foolish break in prices leaders of finance rush-
ed to the exchanges trying by arguments and ex-
postulations to arrest the downfall but in vain

  in the afternoon however reason partially re-
sumed its sway then a quick recovery was felt and
many who had rushed to sell all they had found
cause to regret their precipitancy the next day all
was on the mend as far as the stock market was
concerned but among the people at large the poison
of awakened credulity continued to spread nourish-
ed by fresh announcements from the fountain head

   cosmo issued another statement to the effect that
he had perfected plans for an ark of safety which
he would begin at once to construct in the neigh-
borhood of new york and he not only offered freely
to give his plans to any who wished to commence
construction on their owii account but he urged
them in the name of heaven to lose no time this
produced a prodigious effect and multitudes began
to be infected with a nameless fear

  meanwhile an extraordinary scene occurred be-
hind closed doors at the headquarters of the car-
negie institution in washington joseph smith
actng under cosmo versals direction had for-
warded an elaborate precis of the latters argu-
ment accompanied with full mathematical details
to the head of the institution the character of this
document was such that it could not be ignored
moreover the savants composing the council of the
most important scientific association in the world
were aware of the state of the public mind and
felt that it was incumbent upon them to do some-
thing to allay the alarm of late years a sort of
supervisory control over scientific news of all kinds
had been accorded to them and they appreciated
the fact that a duty now rested upon their shoulders

   accordingly a special meeting was called to con-
sider the communication from cosmo versal it
was the general belief that a little critical examin-
ation would result in complete proof of the fallacy
of all his work proof which could be put in a form
that the most uninstructed would understand

  but the papers diagrams and mathematical
formulas had no sooner been spread upon the table
under the knowing eyes of the learned members of

	the council than a chill of conscious impuissance
ran through them they saw that cosmos mathe-


amazing stories

zcatics were unimpeachable his formulae were ac-
curately deduced and his operations absolutely
correct

  they could do nothing but attack his fundamental
data based on the alleged revelations of his -new
kind of spectroscope and on telescopic observations
which were described in so much detail that the
only way to combat them was by the general asser-
tion that they were illusory this was felt to be a
very unsatisfactory method of procedure as far as
the public was concerned because it amounted to no
more than attacking the credibility of a witness who
pretended to describe only what he himself had seen
-and there is nothing so hard as to prove a nega-
tive

  then cosmo had on his side the whole force of
that curious tendency of the human mind which
habitually gravitates toward whatever is extraor-
dinary revolutionary and mysterious

  but a yet greater difficulty arose mention has
been made of the strange bulletin from the mount
mckinley observatory -that had been incau-
tiously sent out to the public by a thoughtless ob-
server who was more intent upon describing a sin-
gular phenomenon than upon considering its possible
effect on the popular imagination he had imme-
diately received an expostulatory despatch from
headquarters which henceforth shut his mouth-but
he had told the simple truth and how embarrassing
that was became evident when on the very table
around which the savants were now assembled three
despatches were laid in quick succession from the
great observatories of mount hekla in iceland the
north cape and kamchatka all corroborating the
statement of the mount mckinley observer that an
inexplicable veiling of faint stars had manifested
itself in the boreal quarter of the sky
when the president read the despatches-which
the senders had taken the precaution to maik confi-
dential-the members of the council looked at one
another with no little dismay here was the most
unprejudiced corroboration of cosmo versals as-
sertion that the great nebula was already within the
range of observation how could they dispute such
testimony and what were they to make of it

  two or three of the members began to be shaken
in their convictions

  upon my word exclaimed professor alexander
jones but this is very curious and suppose the
fellow should be right after all

  right cried the president professor pludder
disdainfully who ever heard of a watery nebula
the things absurd

  i dont see that its absurd replied prof jones
theres plenty of proof of the existence of hy-
drogen in some of the nebulae

  so there is chimed in prof abel able and if
theres hydrogen there may be oxygen and there
you have all thats necessary its not the idea that
a nebula may consist of watery vapor thats absurd
but it is that a watery nebula large enough to
drown the earth by condensation upon it could have
approached so near as this one must now be without
sooner betraying its presence

  how so demanded a voice

  by its attraction cosmo versl says it is al-
ready less than three hundred million miles away

if it is massive enough to drown the earth it ought
long ago to have been discovered by its disturbance
of the planetary orbits

  not at all exclaimed professor jeremiah moses
if you stick to that argument youll be drowned
sure just look at these facts the earth weighs
six and a half sextillions of tons and the ocean one
and a half quintillions the average depth of the
oceans is two and one-fifth miles now-if the level
of the ocean were raised only about  feet prac-
tically all the inhabited parts of the world would be
flooded to cause that increase in the level of the
oceans only about one-eighth part would have to be
added to their total mass or say one-seventh part
allowing for the greater surface to be covered that
would be one thirty-thousandth of the weight of the
globe and if you suppose that only one-hundredth
of the entire nebula were condensed on the earth
the whole mass of the nebula would not need to ex-
ceed one three-hundredth of the weight of the earth
or a quarter that of the moon-and nobody here will
be bold enough to say that the approach of a mass
no greater than that would be likely to be discov-
ered through its attraction when it was three hun-
dred million miles away

  several of the astronomers present shook their
heads at this and professor pludder irritably de-
clared that it was absurd

  the attraction would be noticeable when it was
a thousand millions of miles away he continued

  yes noticeable i admit replied professor
moses but all the same you wouldnt notice it be-
cause you wouldnt be looking for it unless the
nebula were visible first and even then it would re-
quire months of observation to detect the effects
and how are you going to get around those bulle-
tins  the thing is beginning to be visible now and
ill bet that if from this time on you study care-
fully the planetary motions you will find evidence of
the disturbance becoming stronger and stronger
versl has pointed out that very thing and calcu-
lated the perturbations this thing has come like a
thief in the night

  youd better hurry up and secure a place in the
ark said professor pludder sarcastically

  i dont know but i shall if i can get one re-
turned professor moses you may not think this
is such a laughing matter a few months hence

  im surprised pursued the president that a
man of your scientific standing should stultify him-
self by taking seriously such balderdash as this i
tell you the thing is absurd

  and i tell you you are absurd to say so re-
torted professor moses losing his temper youve
got four of the biggest telescopes in the world under
your control why dont you order your observers
to look for this thing

  professor pludder who was a very big man rear-
ed up his rotund form and bringing his fist down
upon the table with a resounding whack exclaimed
ill do nothing so ridiculous these bulletins
have undoubtedly been influenced by the popular
excitement there has possibly been a little ob-
scurity in the atmosphere-cirrus clouds or some-
thing-and the observers have imagined the rest
im not going to insult science by encouraging the
proceedings of a mountebank like cosmo versl
the second deluge



what weve got to do is to prepare a despatch for
the press reassuring the populace and throwing the
weight of this institution on the side of common
sense and public tranquillity let the secretary in-
dite such a despatch and then well edit it and send
it out

  professor pludder naturally dictatorial was
sometimes a little overbearing but being a man of
great ability and universally respected for his high
rank in the scientific world his colleagues usually
bowed to his decisions on this occasion his force
of character sufficed to silence the doubters and
when the statement intended for the press had re-
ceived its final touches it contained no hint of the
seeds of discord that cosmo versal had sown among
americas foremost savants the next morning it
appeared in all the newspapers as follows

  official statement from the carnegie institute

    in consequence of the popular excitement
  caused by the sensational utterances of a no-
  torious pretender to scientific knowledge in
  new york the council of this institution au-
  thorizes the statement that it has examined
  the alleged grounds on which prediction of a
  great flood to be caused by a nebula encounter-
  ing the earth is based and finds as all real
  men of science knew beforehand that the en-
  tire matter is simply a canard

    the nebulas are not composed of water if
  they were composed of water they could not
  cause a flood on the earth the report that some
  strange misty object is visible in the starry
  heavens is based on a misapprehension and
  finally the so-called calculations of the author
  of this inexcusable hoax are baseless and to-
  tally devoid of scientific validity

    the public is earnestly advised to pay no
  further attention to the matter if there were
  any danger to the earth-and such a thing is
  not to be seriously considered-astronomers
  would know it long in advance and would give
  due and official warning

  unfortunately for the popular effect of this pro-
nouncement on the very morning when it appeared
in print thirty thousand people were crowded
around the old aviation field at mineola excitedly
watching cosmo versal with five hundred work-
men laying the foundation of a huge platform
while about the field were stretched sheets of can-
yas displaying the words

the ark of safety

earnest inspection invited for all
attendants will furnish gratis plans for similar
constructions

small arks can be built for families

act while there is yet time

  the multitude saw at a glance that here was a
work that would cost millions and the spectacle of
this immense expenditure the evidence that cosmo
was backing his words with his money furnished a
silent argument which was irresistible in the
midst of all flying about among his men was cosmo
impressing every beholder with the feeling that in-
tellect was in charge

  like the gray coat of napoleon on a battle-field
the sign of that mighty brow bred confidence

chapter iii

the first drops of the deluge

the utterance of the carnegie institution
indeed fell flat and cosmo versals star
reigned in the ascendent he pushed his
preparations with amazing speed and not only
politics but even the war that had just broken out
in south america were swallowed up in the news-
papers by endless descriptions of the mysterious
proceedings at mineola cosmo still found time
every day to write articles and to give out inter-
views and joseph smith was kept constantly on
the jump running for street-cars or trains or leap-
ing with his long coat flapping into and out of
elevators on ceaseless missions to the papers the
scientific societies and the meetings of learned or
unlearned bodies which had been persuaded to in-
vestigate the subject of the coming flood between
the work of preparation and that of proselytism it
is difficult to see how cosmo found sleep

  day by day the ark of safety rose higher upon its
great platform its huge metallic ribs and broad
bulging sides glinting strangely in the unbroken
sunshine-for as if imitating the ominous quiet be-
fore an earthquake the july sky had stripped itself
of all clouds no thunder-storms broke the serenity
of the long days and never had the overarching
heavens seemed so spotless and motionless in their
cerulean depths

  a over the world as the news despatches showed
the same strange calm prevailed cosmo did not
fail to call attention to this unparalleled repose of
nature as a sure prognostic of the awful event in
preparation

  the heat became tremendous hundreds were
stricken down in the blazing streets multitudes
fled to the seashore and lay panting under um-
brellas on the burning sands or vainly sought re-
lief by plunging into the heated water which
rolling lazily in with the tide felt as if it had come
from over a boiler

  still perspiring crowds constantly watched the
workmen who struggled with the overpowering
heat although cosmo had erected canvas screens
for them and installed a hundred immense electric
fans to create a breeze

  beginning with five hundred men he had in less
than a month increased his force to nearer five
thousand many of whom not engaged in the actual
construction were preparing the materials and
bringing them together the ark was being made
of pure levium the wonderful new metal which
although already employed in the construction of
airplanes and the framework of dirigible balloons
had not before been used for shipbuilding except in
the case of a few small boats and these only
in the navy

  for mere raw material cosmo must have expend-
ed an enormous sum and his expenses were quad-
rupled by the fact that he was compelled in order
to save time practically to lease several of the
largest steel plants in the country fortunately
levium was easily rolled into plates and the supply


amazing stories

was sufficient owing to the discovery two years
before of an expeditious process of producing the
metal from its ores

  the radio telegraph and telephone offices were
besieged by correspondents eager to send inland
and all over europe and asia the latest particulars
of the constiuction of the great ark nobody fol-
lowed cosmos advice or example but everybody
was intensely interested and puzzled

  at last the government officials found themselves
forced to take cognizance of the affair they could
no longer ignore it after they discovered that it was
seriously interfering with the conduct of public
business cosmo versals pressing orders accom-
panied by cash displaced or delayed orders of the
government commanding materials for the navy and
the air fleet in consequence about the middle of
july he received a summons to visit the president
of the united states cosmo hurried to washing-
ton on the given date and presented his card at the
white house he was shown immediately into the
presidents reception-room where he found the en-
tire cabinet in presence as he entered he was the
focus of a formidable battery of curious and not
too friendly eyes

  president samson was a large heavy man more
than six feet tall every member of the cabinet
was above the average in avoirdupois and the
heavy-weight president of the carnegie institution
professor pludder who had been specially invited
added by his presence to the air of ponderosity
that characterized the assemblage all seemed
magnified by the thin white garments which they
wore on account of the oppressive heat many of
them had come in haste from various summer re-
sorts and were plainly annoyed by the necessity of
attending at the presidents command

  cosmo versl was the only cool man there and
his diminutive form presented a striking contrast
to the others but he looked as if he carried more
brains than all of them put together

  he was not in the least overawed by the hostile
glances of the statesmen on the contrary his lips
perceptibly curled in a half-disdainful smile as he
took the big hand which the president extended to
him as soon as cosmo versal had sunk into the
embrace of a large easy chair the president opened
the subject

  i have directed you to come he said in a
majestic tone in order the sooner to dispel the
effects of your unjustifiable predictions and extra-
ordinary proceedings on the public mind-and i
may add on public affairs are you aware that you
have interfered with the measures of this govern-
ment for the defense of the country you have
stepped in front of the government and delayed the
beginning of four battle-ships which congress has
authorized in urgent haste on account of the threat-
ening aspect of affairs in the east i need hardly
say to you that we shall if necessary find means
to set aside the private agreements under which
you are proceeding as inimical to public interests
but you have already struck a serious blow at the
security of your country

  the president pronounced the last sentence with
oratorical unction and cosmo was conscious of an

approving movement of big official shoulders around
him the disdain deepened on his lips

  after a moments pause the president continued
before proceeding to extremities i have wished
to see you personally in order in the first place to
assure myself that you are mentally responsible and
then to appeal to your patriotism which should lead
you to withdraw at once an obstruction so dan-
gerous to the nation do you know the position in
which you have placed yourself

  cosmo versal got upon his feet and advanced to
the center of the room like a little david every
eye was fixed upon him his voice was steady but
intense with suppressed nervousness

  mr president he said you have accused me
of obstructing the measures of the government for
the defense of the country sir i am trying to save
the whole human race from a danger in comparison
with which that of war is infinitesimal-a danger
which is rushing down upon us with appalling
speed and which will strike every land on the globe
simultaneously within seven months not a war-
ship or any other existing vessel will remain afloat
the listeners smiled and nodded significantly to
one another but the speaker only grew more
earnest

  you think i am insane he said but the truth
is you are hoodwinked by official stupidity that
man pointing to professor pludder who knows
me well and who has had all my proofs laid before
him is either too thick-headed to understand a
demonstration or too pig-headed to confess his own
error

  come come interrupted the president sternly
while professor pludder flushed very red this will
not do indulge in no personalities here i have
strained the point in offering to listen to you at all
and i have invited the head of the greatest of our
scientific societies to be present with the hope that
here before us all he might convince you of your
folly and thus bring the whole unfortunate affair
promptly to an end

  he convince me cried cosmo versal disdain-
fully he is incapable of understanding the a b
c of my work but let me tell you this mr presi-
dent-there are men in his own council who are not
so blind i know what occurred at the recent meet-
ing of that council and i know that the ridiculous
announcement put forth in its name to deceive the
public was whipped into shape by him and does not
express the real opinion of many of the members
professor pludders face grew redder than ever
name one he thundered

  ah said cosmo sneeringly that hits hard
doesnt it you want me to name one well ill
name three what did professor alexander jones
and professor abel able say about the existence of
watery nebula and what was the opinion expressed
by professor jeremiah moses about the actual ap-
proach of one out of the northern sky and what it
could do if it hit the earth what was the unani-
mous opinion of the entire council about the cor-
rectness of my mathematical work and what
he continued approaching professor pludder and
shaking his finger up at him-what have you done
with those three despatches from iceland the
north cape and kamchatka which absolutely con
the second deluge



firmed my announcement that the nebula was al-
ready visible

  professor pludder began stammeringly

  some spy-

  ah cried cosmocatching him up a spy hey
then you admit it mr president i beg you to
notice that he admits it sir this is a conspiracy to
conceal the truth great heavens the world is on
the point of being drowned and yet the pride of
officialism is so strong in this plodder-pludder-
and others of his ilk that theyd sooner take the
chance of letting the human race be destroyed than
recognize the truth

  cosmo versal spoke with such tremendous concen-
tration of mental energy and with such evident
sincerity of conviction and he had so plainly put
professor pludder to rout that the president no
less thanthe other listening statesmen was thrown
into a quandary

  there was a creaking of heavily burdened chairs
a ponderous stir all round the circle while a look
of perplexity became visible on every face pro-
fessor pludders conduct helped to produce the
change of moral atmosphere he had been so com-
pletely surprised by cosmos accusation based on
facts which he had supposed were known only to
himself and the council that he was unable for a
minute to speak at all and before he could align his
faculties his triumphant little opponent renewed
the attack -

  mr president he said laying his hand on the
arm of mr samsons big chair which was nearly on
a level with his breast and speaking with persua-
sive earnestness you are the executive head of a
mighty nation-the nation that sets the pace for the
world it is in your power to do a vast an in-
calculable service to humanity one official word
from you would save millions upon millions of lives
i implore you instead of interfering with my work
to give instant order for the construction of as
many arks based upon the plans i have perfected
as the navy yard can possibly turn out issue a
proclamation to the people warning them that this
is their only chance of escape

  by a curious operation of the human mind this
speech cost cosmo nearly all the advantage that he
had previously gained his ominous suggestion of
a great nebula rushing out of the heavens to over-
whelm the earth had immensely impressed the
imagination of his hearers and his uncontradicted
accusation that professor pludder was concealing
the facts had almost convinced them that he was
right but when he mentioned arks the strain
was relieved and a smile broke out on the broad
face of the president he shook his head and was
about to speak when cosmo perceiving that he-had
lost ground changed his tactics

  still you are incredulous he exclaimed but
the proof is before you look at the blazing
heavens the annals of meteorology do not record
another such summer as this the vanguard of the
fatal nebula is already upon us the signs of dis-
aster are in the sky but note what i say-this
is only the first sign there is another following
on its heels which may be -here at any moment to
heat will succeed cold and as we rush through the
tenuous outer spirals the earth will alternately be

whipped with tempests of snow and sleet and
scorched by fierce outbursts of solar fire for
three weeks the sun has been feeding its furnaces
with invisible vapor-but look out i warn you for
the change that is impending

  these extraordinary words pronounced with the
wild air of a prophet completed the growing convic-
tion of the listeners that they really had a madman
to deal with and professor pludder having re-
covered his self-command rose to his feet

  mr president he began the evidence which
we have just seen of an unbalanced mind-

  he got no further a pall of darkness suddenly
dropped upon the room an inky curtain seemed to
have fallen from the sky at the same time the win-
dows were shaken by tremendous blasts of wind
and as the electric lights were hastily turned on
huge snowflakes intermingled with rattling hail-
stones were seen careering outside in a few
seconds several large panes of glass were broken
and the chilling wind sweeping round the apart-
ment made the teeth of the -thinly clad statesmen
chatter while the noise of the storm became deaf-
ening the sky lighted but at the same moment
dreadful thunder-peals shook the building two or
three trees in the white house grounds were struck
by the bolts and their broken branches were driven
through the air and carried high above the ground
by the whirling winds and one of them was thrown
against the building with such force that for a
moment it seemed as if thewall had been shattered

  after the first stunning effect of this outbreak
of the elements had passed everybody rushed to the
windows to look out- everybody except cosmo
versal who remained standing in the center of the
room

  i told you he said but nobody listened to him
what they saw outside absorbed every faculty
the noise was so stunning that they could not have
heard him

  we have said that -the air lightened after the
passage of the first pall of darkness but it was not
the reappearance of the sun that caused the bright-
ening it was an awful light which seemed to be
born out of the air itself it had a menacing cop-
pery hue continually changing in character the
whole upper atmosphere was choked with dense
clouds which swirled and -tumbled and twisted
themselves into great vortical rolls spinning like
gigantic mill-shafts once one of these vortexes
shot downward with projectile speed rapidly as-
suming the terrible form of the trombe of a tornado
and where it struck -the ground it tore everything to
pieces-trees houses the very earth itself were
ground to powder and then whirled aloft by the
resistless suction

  occasionally the darkness returned for a few
minutes as if a cover had been clapped upon the
sky and then again the murk would roll off and
the reddish gleam would reappear these swift
alternations of impenetrable gloom and unearthly
light shook the hearts of the dumfounded states-
men even more than the roar and rush of the storm

  a cry of horror broke from the onlookers when a
man and a woman suddenly appeared trying to cross
the white house grounds to reach a place of com
parative safety and were caught up by the wind


amazing stories

clinging desperately to each other and hurled
against a wall at whose base they fell in a heap

  then came another outburst of lightning and a
vicious bolt descended upon the washington monu-
ment and twisting round it seemed to envelope
the great shaft in a pulsating corkscrew of blinding
fire the report that instantly followed made the
white house dance upon its foundations and as if
that had been a signal the flood-gates of the sky
immediately opened and rain so dense that it looked
like a solid cataract of water poured down upon the
earth the raging water burst into the basement
of the building and ran off in a shoreless river to-
ward the potomac

  the streaming rain still driven by the wind
poured through the broken windows driving the
president and the others to the middle of the room
where they soon stood in rills of water soaking the
thick carpet

  they were all as pale as death their eyes
sought one anothers faces in dumb amazement
cosmo versal alone retained perfect self-command
in spite of his slight stature he looked their master
raising his voice to the highest pitch in order to
be heard he shouted

  these are the first drops of the deluge will
you believe now

chapter iv

the world swept with terror

the tempest of hail snow lightning and rain
which burst so unexpectedly over washing-
ton was not a local phenomenon it leveled
the antennae of the radio systems all over the world
cutting off communication everywhere only the
submarine cables remained unaffected and by them
was transmitted the most astonishing news of the
ravages of the storm rivers had careered over
their banks low-lying towns were flooded the
swollen sewers of cities exploded and inundated the
streets and gradually news came in from country
districts showing that vast areas of land had been
submerged and hundreds drowned

  the downfall of rain far exceeded everything that
the meteorological bureaus had ever recorded

  the vagaries of the lightning and the frightful
power that it exhibited were especially terrifying

  in london the victoria tower was partly dis-
mantled by a bolt

  in moscow the ancient and beautiful church of
st basil was nearly destroyed

  the celebrated leaning tower of pisa the wonder
of centuries was flung to the ground

  the vast dome of st peters at rome was said to
have been encased during three whole minutes with
a blinding armor of electric fire though the only
harm done was the throwing down of a statue in
one of the chapels

  but strangest freak of all in new york a tre-
mendous bolt which seems to have entered the
pennsylvania tunnel on the jersey side followed
the rails under the river throwing two trains from
the track and emerging in the great station in the
heart of the city expanded into a rose-colored
sphere which exploded with an awful report and
blew the great roof to pieces and yet although the

fragments were scattered a dozen blocks away
hundreds of persons who were in the stations suf-
fered no other injury than such as resulted from
being flung violently to the floor or against the
walls

  cosmo versals great ark seemed charmed not
a single discharge of lightning occurred in its vicin-
ity a fact which he attributed to the dielectric
properties of levium nevertheless the wind car-
ried away all his screens and electric fans

  if this storm had continued the predicted deluge
would unquestionably have occurred at once and
even its prophet would have perished through hav-
ing begun his preparations too late but the dis-
turbed elements sank into repose as suddenly as they
had broken out with fury the rain did not last
in most places more than twenty-four hours al-
though the atmosphere continued to be filled with
troubled clouds for a week at the end of that time
the sun reappeared as hot as before and a spot-
less dome once more over-arched the earth but
from this time the sky never resumed its former
brilliant azure-there was always a strange cop-
pery tinge the sight of which was appalling al-
though it gradually lost its first effect through
familiarity

  the indifference and derision with which cosmos
predictions and elaborate preparations had hitherto
been regarded now vanished and the world in
spite of itself shivered with vague apprehension
no reassurances from those savants who still re-
fused to admit any validity in cosmo versals cal-
culations and deductions had any permanent effect
upon the public mind

  with amusing inconsequence people sold stocks
again until all the exchanges were once more swept
with panic-and then put tlie money in their strong
boxes as if they thought that the mere possession
of the lucre could protect them they hugged the
money and remained deaf to cosmos reiterated
advice to build arks with it

  after all they were only terrified not convinced
and they felt that somehow everything would come
out right now that they had their possessions well
in hand

  for in spite of the scare nobody really believed
that an actual deluge was coming there might be
great floods and great suffering and loss but the
world was not going to be drowned such things
only occurred in early and dark ages

  some nervous persons found comfort in the fact
that when the skies cleared after the sudden down-
pour brilliant rainbows were seen their hearts
bounded with joy

  the bow of promisev  they cried behold the
unvarying assurance that the world shall never
again be drowned

  then a great revival movement was set on foot
starting in the mississippi valley under the leader-
ship of an eloquent exhorter who declared that al-
though a false prophet had arisen whose delusive
prediction was contrary to scripture yet it was true
that the world was about to be punished in unex-
pected ways for its many iniquities

  this movement rapidly spread all over the coun-
try and was taken up in england and throughout
protestant europe and soon prayers were offered
the second deluge



in thousands of churches to avert the wrath of
heaven multitudes thus found their fears turned
into a new direction and by a strange reaction
cosmo versal came to be regarded as a kind of
antichrist who was seeking to mislead mankind

  just at this juncture to add to the dismay and
uncertainty a grand and fearful comet suddenly ap-
peared it came up unexpectedly from the south
blazed brightly close beside the sun even at noon-
day and a few nights later was visible after sunset
with an immense fiery head and a broad curved tail
that seemed to pulsate from end to end it was so
bright that it cast shadows at night as distinct as
those made by the moon no such cometary monster
had ever before been seen people shuddered when
they looked at it it moved with amazing speed
sweeping across the firmament like a besom of
destruction calculation showed that it was not
more than  miles from the earth

  but one night the wonder and dread awakened
by the comet were magnified a hundredfold by an
occurrence so unexpected and extraordinary that
the spectators gasped in amazement

  the writer happens to have before him an entry
in a diary which is probably the sole contemporary
record of this event it was written in the city of
washington by no less a person than prof jeremiah
moses of the council of the carnegie institution
let it tell its own story

  a marvelous thing happened this night i
walked out into the park near my house with the
intention of viewing the great comet the park
on my side the west is bordered with a dense
screen of tall trees and i advanced toward the open
place in the center in order to have an unobstructed
sight of the flaming stranger as i passed across
the edge of the shadow of the trees-the ground
ahead being brilliantly illuminated by the light of
the comet-i suddenly noticed with an involuntary
start that i was being preceded by a double shadow
which forked away from my feet

  i cast my eyes behind me to find the cause of
the phenomenon and saw to my inexpressible
amazement that the comet had divided into two
there were two distinct heads already widely separ-
ated but each it seemed to me as brilliant as the
original one had been and each supplied with a
vast plume of fire a hundred degrees in length and
consequently stretching far past the zenith the
cause of the double shadow was evident at once-
but what can have produced this sudden disruption
of the comet it must have occurred since last
evening and already if the calculated distance of
the comet is correct the parts of the severed head
are  miles asunder

  underneath this entry was scribbled

  can this have anything to do with cosmo ver-
sals flood

  whether it had anything to do with the flood or
not at any rate the public believed that it had
people went about with fear written on their faces

  the double shadoivs had a surprising effect the
phantasm was pointed out and stared at with super-
stitious terror by thousands every night the fact
that there was nothing really mysterious about it

made no difference even those who knew well that
it was an inevitable optical result of the division
of the bright comet were thrilled with instinctive
dread when they saw that forked shadow mimick-
ing their every movement there is nothing that
so upsets the mind as a sudden change in the as-
pect of familiar things

  the astronomers now took their turn those who
were absolutely incredulous about casmos predic-
tion and genuinely desirious of allaying the popular
alarm issued statements in which with a disin-
genuousness that may have been unintentional they
tried to sidetrack his arguments

  professor pludder led the way with a pronuncia-
mento declaring that the absurd vaporings of the
modern nostradamus of new york had now demon-
strated their own emptiness

  a comet said professor pludder with reassur-
ing seriousness cannot down the earth it is
composed of rare gases which as the experience
of haileys comet many years ago showed are un-
able to penetrate the atmosphere even when an
actual encounter occurs in this case there cannot
even be an encounter the comet is now moving
away its division is not an unprecedented occur-
rence for many previous comets have met with
similar accidents this comet happened to be of
unusual size and the partition of the head occurred
when it was relatively near-by-whence the start-
ling phenomena observed there is nothing to be
feared

  it will be remarked that professor pludder en-
tirely avoided the real issue cosmo versal had
never said that the comet would drown the earth
in fact he had been as much surprised by its ap-
pearance as everybody else but when he read
professor pludders statement followed by others
of similar import he took up the cudgels with a
vengeance all over the world translated into a
dozen languages he scattered his reply and the
effect was startling

  my fellow-citizens of the world in all lands and
of every race he began you are face to face with
destruction and yet while its heralds are plainly
signaling from the sky and shaking the earth with
lightning to awaken it blind leaders of the blind
try to deceive you

  they are defying science itself

  they say that the comet cannot touch the earth
that is true it is passing away i myself did not
foresee its coming it arrived by accident but
every step that it has made through the silent
depths of space has been a proclamation of the
presence of the nebtda which is the real agent of
the perdition of the world

  why that ominous redness which overcasts the
heavens you have all noticed it why that blind-
ing brightness which the comet has displayed ex-
ceeding all that has ever been beheld in such visitors
the explanation is plain the comet has been feed
ing on the substance of the nebida which is rare
yet because we have only encountered some of its
outlying spirals

  but it is coming on with terrible speed in a
few short months we shall be plunged into its awful


amazing stories

center and then the oceans will swell to the moun-
tain-tops and the continents will become the bottom
of angry seas

  when the flood begins it will be too late to save
yourselves you have already lost too much precious
time i tell you solemnly that not one in a million
can now be saved throw away every other con-
sideration and try try desperately to be of the
little company of those who escape

  remember that your only chance is in building
arks-arks of levium the metal that floats i have
sent broadcast plans for such arks they can be
made of any size but the larger the better in my
own ark i can take only a selected number and
when the complement is made up not another soul
will be admitted

  i have established all my facts by mathematical
proofs the most expert mathematicians of the
world have been unable to detect any error in my
calculations they try to dispute the data but the
data are already before you for your own judg-
ment the heavens are so obscured that only the
brightest stars can now be seen this was a
fact which had caused bewilderment in the observa-
tories the recent outburst of storms and floods
was the second sign of the approaching end and
the third sign will not be long delayed-and after
that the deluge

  it is futile to try to describe the haunting fear v
and horror which seized upon the majority of the
millions who read these words business was para-
lyzed for men found it impossible to concentrate
their minds upon ordinary affairs every night the
twin comets still very bright although they were
fast retreating brandished their fiery scimitars in
the sky-more fearful to the imagination now since
cosmo versal had declared that it was the nebula
that stimulated their energies and by day the
sky was watched with anxious eyes striving to
detect signs of a deepening of the menacing hue
which to an excited fancy suggested a tinge of
blood

  now at last cosmos warnings and entreaties
bore practical fruit men began to inquire about
places in his ark and to make preparations for
building arks of their own

  he had not been interfered with after his memor-
able interview with the president of the united
states and had pushed his work at mineola with
redoubled energy employing night gangs of work-
men so that progress was continuous throughout
the twenty-four hours

  standing on its platform the ark whose hull was
approaching completion rose a hundred feet into
the air it was  feet long and  broad-pro-
portions which practical ship-builders ridiculed but
cosmo as original in this as in everything else
declared that taking into account the buoyancy of
levium no other form would answer as well he
estimated that when its great engines were in place
its immense stores of material for producing power
its ballast and its supplies of food stowed away and
its cargo of men and animals taken aboard it would
not draw more than twenty feet of water

  hardly a day passed now without somebody com-
ing to cosmo to inquire about the best method

of constructing arks he gave the required in-
formation in all possible detail with the utmost
willingness he drew plans and sketches made all
kinds of practical suggestions and never failed
to urge the utmost haste he inspired every visitor
at the same time with alarm and a resolution to go
to work at once

  some did go to work but their progress was
slow and as days passed and the comets gradually
faded out of sight and then the dome of the sky
showed a tendency to resume its natural blueness
the enthusiasm of cosmos imitators weakened to-
gether with their confidence in his prophetic powers

  they concluded to postpone their operations until
the need of arks should become more evident

  as to those who had sent inquiries about places
in cosmos ark now that the danger seemed to
be blowing away they did not even take the trouble
to acknowledge the very kind responses that he had
made

  it is a singular circumstance that not one of these
anxious inquirers seemed to have paid particular at-
tention to a very significant sentence in his reply
if they had given it a little thought it would pro-
bably have set them pondering although they
might have been more puzzled than edified the
sentence ran as follows

  while assuring you that my ark has been built
for the benefit of my fellow men i am bound to tell
you that i reserve absolutely the right to determine
who are truly representative of homo sapiens 

  the fact was that cosmo had been turning over
in his mind the great fundamental question which
he had asked himself when the idea of trying to
save the human race from annihilation had first
occurred to him and apparently he had fixed upon
certain principles that were to guide him

  since when the mind is under great strain
through fear the slightest relaxation caused by
an apparently favorable change produces a rebound
of hope as unreasoning as the preceding terror so
on this occasion the vanishing of the comets and
the fading of the disquieting color of the sky had
a wonderful effect in restoring public confidence
in the orderly procession of nature

  cosmo versals vogue as a prophet of disaster was
soon gone and once more everybody began to laugh
at him people turned again to their neglected
affairs with the general remark that they guessed
the world would manage to wade through

  those who had begun preparations to build arks
looked very sheepish when their friends guyed
them about their childish credulity

  then a feeling of angry resentment arose and
one day cosmo versal was mobbed in the street
and the gamins threw stones at him

  people forgot the extraordinary storm of light-
ning and rain the split comet and all the other cir-
cumstances which a little time before had filled
them with terror

  but they were making a fearful mistake

  with eyes blindfolded they were walking straight
into the jaws of destruction

  without warning and as suddenly almost as an
explosion the third sign appeared and on its heel
came a veritable reign of terror
the second deluge



chapter v

the third sign

in the middle of the night at new york hun-
dreds of thousands simultaneously awoke with
a feeling of suffocation

  they struggled for breath as if they had suddenly
been plunged into a steam bath

  the air was hot heavy and terribly oppressive
the throwing open of windows brought no relief
the outer air was as stifling as that within

  it was so dark that on looking out one could not
see his own doorsteps the arc lamps in the street
flickered with an ineffective blue gleam which shed
no illumination round about

  house lights when turned on looked like tiny 
candles enclosed in thick blue globes

  frightened men and women stumbled around in
the gloom of their chambers trying to dress them-
selves

  cries and exclamations rang from room to room
children wailed hysterical mothers ran wildly
hither and thither seeking their little ones many
fainted partly through terror and partly from the
difficulty of breathing sick persons seized with a
terrible oppression of the chest gasped and never
rose from their beds

  at every window and in every doorway through-
out the vast city invisible heads and forms were
crowded making their presence known by their
voices-distracted householders striving to peer
through the strange darkness and to find out tfie
cause of these terrifying phenomena

  some managed to get a faint glimpse of their
watches by holding them close against lamps and
thus noted the time it was two oclock in the
morning

  neighbors unseen called to one another but got
little comfort from the replies

  what is it in gods name what has happened
  i dont know i can hardly breathe

  it is awful we shall all be suffocated

  is it a fire

  no no it cannot be a fire

  the air is full of steam the stones and the
window-panes are streaming with moisture

  great heavens how stifling it is

then into thousands of minds at once leaped the
thought of the floodl
the memory of cosmo versals reiterated warn-
ings came back with overwhelming force it must
be the third sign that he had foretold it had come

  those fateful words-the flood and cosmo
versal-ran from lip to lip and the hearts of those
who spoke and those who heard sank like lead in
their bosoms

  he would be a bold man more confident in his
powers of description than the present writer who
should attempt to picture the scenes in new york
on that fearful night

  the gasping and terror-stricken millions waited
and longed for the hour of sunrise hoping that
then the stygian darkness would be dissipated so
that people might at least see where to go and
what to do many oppressed by the almost un-
breathable air gave up in despair and no longer
even hoped for morning to come

  in the midst of it all a collision occurred directly
over central park between two air-expresses one
coming from boston and the other from albany
the use of small airplanes within the city limits
had for sometime been prohibited on account of
the constant danger of collisions but the long-
distance lines were permitted to enter the metro-
politan district making their landings and depar-
tures on specially constructed towers these two
crowded with passengers had as it afterward ap-
peared completely lost their bearings-the strong-
est electric lights being invisible a few hundred
feet away while the wireless signals were confusing
-and before the danger was apprehended they
crashed together

  the collision occurred at a height of a thousand
feet on the fifth avenue side of the park both
of the air-ships had their air foils smashed and
their decks crumpled up and the unfortunate crews
and passengers were hurled through the im-
penetrable darkness to the ground

  only four or five who were lucky enough to be
entangled with the lighter parts of the wreckage
escaped with their lives but they were too much
injured to get upon their feet and there they lay
their sufferings made tenfold worse by the stifling
air and the horror of their inexplicable situation
until they were found and humanely relieved more
than ten hours after their fall

  the noise of the collision had been heard in
fifth avenue and its meaning was understood but
amid the universal terror no one thought of trying
to aid the victims everybody was absorbed in
wondering what would become of himself

  when the long attended hour of sunrise approach-
ed the watchers were appalled by the absence of
even the slightest indication of the reappearance
of the orb of day there was no lightening of the
dense cloak of darkness and the great city seemed
dead

  for the first time in its history it failed to awake
after its regular period of repose and to send
forth its myriad voices it could not be seen it
could not be heard it made no sign as far as any
outward indication of its existence was concerned
the mighty capital had ceased to be

  it was this frightful silence of the streets and
of all the outer world that terrified the people
cooped up in their houses and in their rooms by the
walls of darkness more than almost any other
circumstance it gave such an overwhelming sense
of the universality of the disaster whatever that
disaster might be except where the voices of
neighbors could be heard one could not be sure
that the whole population outside his own family
had not perished

  as the hours passed and yet no light appeared
another intimidating circumstance manifested itself
from the start everybody had noticed the excessive
humidity of the dense air every solid object that
the hands came in contact with in the darkness was
wet as if a thick fog had condensed upon it this
supersaturation of the air a principal cause of the
difficulty experienced in breathing led to a result
which would quickly have been foreseen if people
could have had the use of their eyes but which
coming on invisibly produced a- panic fear when at


amazing stories

last its presence was strikingly forced upon the
attention

  the moisture collected on all exposed surfaces
-on the roofs the walls the pavements-until
its quantity became sufficient to form little rills
which sought the gutters and there gathered force
and volume presently the streams became large
enough to create a noise of flowing water that at-
tracted the attention of the anxious watchers at the
open windows then cries of dismay arose if
the water had been visible it would not have been
terrible

  but to the overstrained imagination the bub-
bling and splashing sound that came out of the
darkness was magnified into the rush of a torrent
it seemed to grow louder every moment what
was but a murmur on the ear-drum became a roar
in the excited brain-cells

  once more were heard the ominous word the
flood

  panic spread from room to room and from
house to house the wild scenes that had attended
the first awakening were tame in comparison with
what now occurred self-control reason-every-
thing-gave way to panic

  if they could have seen what they were about

  but then they would not have been about it then
their reason would not have been dethroned

  darkness is the microscope of the imagination
and it magnifies a million times

  some timorously descended their doorsteps and
feeling a current of water in the gutter recoiled
with cries of horror as if they had slipped down the
bank of a flooded river as they retreated they
believed that the water was rising at their heels

  others made their way to the roofs persuaded
that the flood was already inundating the basements
and the lower stories of their dwellings

  women wrung their hands and wept and children
cried and men pushed and stumbled about and
shouted and would have done something if only
they could have seen what to do that was the
pity of it it was as if the world had been stricken
blind and then the trump of an archangel had
sounded crying

  fly fly for the avenger is on your heels

  how could they fly

  this awful strain could not have lasted it would
have needed no deluge to finish new york if that
maddening pall of darkness had remained un-
broken a few hours longer but just when thou-
sands had given up in despair there came a rapid
change

  at the hour of noon light suddenly broke over-
head beginning in a round patch enclosed in an
iridescent halo it spread swiftly seeming to melt
its way down through the thick dark mass that
choked the air and in less than fifteen minutes new
york and all its surroundings emerged into the
golden light of noonday

  people who had expected at any moment to feel
the water pitilessly rising about them looked out
of their windows and were astonished to see only
tiny rivulets which were already shriveling out of
sight in the gutters in a few minutes there was
no running water left although the dampness on

the walls and walks showed how great the humidity
of the air had been

  at the same time the oppression was lifted from
the respiratory apparatus and everybody breathed
freely once more and felt courage returning with
each respiration

  the whole great city seemed to utter a vast sigh
of relief

  and then its voice was heard as it had never
been heard before rising higher and louder every
moment it was the first time that morning had
ever broken at midday

  the streets became filled with magical quickness
by hundreds of thousands who chattered and
shouted and laughed and shook hands and asked
questions and told their experiences and demanded
if anybody had ever heard of such a thing before
and wondered what it could have been and what it
meant and whether it would come back again

  telephones of all kinds were kept constantly
busy women called up their friends and talked
hysterically men called up their associates and
partners and tried to talk business

  there was a rush for the elevated for the sub-
ways for the street auto-cars the great arteries
of traffic became jammed and the noise rose louder
and louder

  belated aero-expresses arrived at the towers
from east and west and their passengers hurried
down to join the excited multitudes below

  in an incredibly brief time the newsboys were
out with extras then everybody read with the
utmost avidity what everybody knew already

  but before many hours passed there was real
news come by radio and by submarine telephone
and telegraph telling how the whole world had
been swept by the marvelous cloak of darkness

  in europe it had arrived uring the morning
hours in asia during the afternoon

  the phenomenon had varied in different places
in some the darkness had not been complete but
everywhere it was accompanied by extraordinary
humidity and occasionally by brief but torrential
rains the terror had been universal and all be-
lieved that it was the third sign predicted by
cosmo versal

  of course the latter was interviewed and he
gave out a characteristic manifesto

  one of the outlying spirals of the nebula has
struck the earth he said but do not be de-
ceived it is nothing in comparison with what is
coming and it is the last warning that will be
given you have obstinately shut your eyes to the
truth and you have throion away your lives

  this together with the recent awful experience
produced a great effect those who had begun to
lay foundations for arks thought of resuming the
work those who had before sought places with
cosmo called him up by telephone but only
the voice of joseph smith answered and his words
were not reassuring

  mr versal he said directs me to say that
at present he will allot no places he is consider-
ing whom he will take 

  the recipients of this reply looked very blank
but at last one of them a well-known broker in
wall street was more angered than frightened
flphe second deluge

jeethi mgcffo tho deuce he growled him and
his flood together

  then he resolutely set out to bull the market

  it seems incredible-but such is human nature-
that a few days of bright sunshine should once
more have driven off the clouds of fear that had
settled so densely over the popular mind of course
not everybody forgot the terrors of the third sign
-they had struck too deep but gradually the strain
was relaxed and people in general accepted the re-
newed assurances of the savants of the pludder
type that nothing that had occurred was inexplicable
by the ordinary laws of nature the great dark-
ness they averred differed from previous occur-
rences of the kind only in degree and it was to be
ascribed to nothing more serious than atmospheric
vagaries such as that which produced the historic
dark day in new england in 

 but more nervous persons noticed with certain
misgivings that cosmo versl pushed on his opera-
tions if possible more energetically than before
and there was a stir of renewed interest when the
announcement came out one day that the ark was
finished then thousands hurried to mineola to
look upon the completed work

  the extraordinary massiveness of the ark was
imposing towering ominously on its platform
which was so arranged that when the waters came
they should lift the structure from its cradle and
set it afloat without any other launching it seemed
in itself a prophecy of impending disaster

  overhead it was roofed with an oblong dome of
levium through which rose four great metallic
chimneys placed above the mighty engines the
roof sloped down to the vertical sides to afford
protection from in-bursting waves rows of port-
holes closed with thick glass indicated the location
of the superposed decks on each side four gang-
ways gave access to the interior and long sloping
approaches offered means of entry from the ground

  cosmo had a force of trained guards on hand
but everybody who wished was permitted to enter
and inspect the ark curious multitudes constantly
mounted and descended the long approaches being
kept moving by the guards

  inside they wandered about astonished at what
they saw

  the three lower decks were devoted to the storage
of food and of fuel for the electric generators all
of which cosmo versl had been accumulating for
months

  above these were two decks which the visitors
were informed would be occupied by animals and
by boxes of seeds and prepared roots of plants with
which it was intended to restore the vegetable life
of the planet after the water should have sufficiently
receded

  the five remaining decks were for human beings
there were roomy quarters for the commander and
his officers others for the crew several large
saloons and five hundred sets of apartments of vari-
ous sizes to be occupied by the passengers whom
cosmo should choose to accompany him they
had all the convenience of the most luxurious state-
rooms of the transoceanic liners many joking re-
marks were exchanged by the visitors as they in-
pected these rooms

  cosmo ran about among his guests explaining
everything showing great pride in his work point-
ing out a thousand particulars in which his fore-
sight had been displayed-but to everybodys
astonishment he uttered no more warnings and
made no appeals on the contrary as some ob-
servant persons noticed he seemed to avoid any
reference to the fate of those who should not be
included in his ships company

  some sensitive souls were disturbed by detecting
in his eyes a look that seemed to express deep pity
and regret occasionally he would draw apart and
gaze at the passing crowds with a compassionate
expression and then slowly turning his back while
his fingers worked nervously would disappear with
downcast head into his private room

  the comparatively few who particularly noticed
this conduct of cosmos were deeply moved-more
than they had been by all the enigmatic events of
the past months one man amos blank a rich
manufacturer who was notorious for the merciless
methods that he had pursued in eliminating his
weaker competitors was so much disturbed by
cosmo versfs change of manner that he sought an
opportunity to speak to him privately cosmo re-
ceived him with a reluctance that he could not but
notice and which somehow increased his anxiety

  -i-thought said the billionaire hesitatingly
that i ought-that is to say that i might perhaps
inquire-might inform myself-under what condi-
tions one could supposing the necessity to arise
obtain a passage in your-in your ark of course
the question of cost does not enter in the matter-
not with me

  cosmo gazed at the man coldly and all the com-
passion that had recently softened his steely eyes
disappeared for a moment he did not speak then
he said measuring his words and speaking with an
emphasis that chilled the heart of his listener

  mr blank the necessity has arisen

  so you say-so you say- began mr blank

  so i say interrupted cosmo sternly and i
say further that this ark has been constructed to
save those who are worthy of salvation in order
that all that is good and admirable in humanity may
not perish from the earth

  exactly exactly responded the other smiling
and rubbing his hands you are quite right to
make a proper choice if your flood is going to
cause a general destruction of mankind of course
you are bound to select the best the most advanced
those who have pushed to the front those who have
means those with the strongest resources the
masses who possess none of these qualifications and
claim-

  again cosmo versl interrupted him more coldly
than before

  it costs nothing to be a passenger in this ark
ten million dollars a hundred millions would not
purchase a place in it did you ever hear the
parable of the camel and the needles eye the
price of a ticket here is an irreproachable record

  with these astonishing words cosmo turned his
back upon his visitor and shut the door in his face

  the billionaire staggered back rubbed his head
and then went off muttering

  an idiot a plain idiot there will be no flood

chapter vi
selecting the flower of mankind

after a day or two during which the ark
was left open for inspection and was visited
by many thousands cosmo versal announced
that no more visitors would be admitted he placed
sentinels at all entrances and began the construc-
tion of a shallow ditch entirely enclosing the
grounds public curiosity was intensely excited by
this singular proceeding especially when it became
known that the workmen were stringing copper
wires the whole length of the ditch

  what the deuce is he up to now was the ques-
tion on everybodys lips

  but cosmo and his employees gave evasive replies
to all inquiries a great change had come about in
comos treatment of the public no one was any
longer encouraged to watch the operations

  when the wires were all placed and the ditch was
finished it was covered up so that it made a broad
flat-topped dyke encircling the field

  speculation was rife for several days concerning
the purpose of the mysterious ditch and its wires
but no universally satisfactory explanation was
found

  one enterprising reporter worked out an elab-
orate scheme which he ascribed to cosmo versl
according to which the wired ditch was to serve as
a cumulator of electricity which would at the pro-
per moment launch the ark upon the waters thus
avoiding all danger of a fatal detention in case
the flood should rise too rapidly

  this seemed so absurd on its face that it went far
to quiet apprehension by reawakening doubts of
cosmos sanity-the more especially since he made
no attempt to contradict the assertion that the
scheme was his

  nobody guessed what his real intention was if
people had guessed it might have been bad for their
peace of mind

  the next move of cosmo versal was taken with-
out any knowledge or suspicion on the part of the
public he had now established himself in his apart-
ments in the ark and was never seen in the city

  one evening when all was quiet about the ark
night work being now unnecessary cosmo and
joseph smith sat facing one another at a square
table lighted by a shaded lamp smith had a pile
of writing paper before him and was evidently pre-
pared to take notes

  cosmos great brow was contracted with thought
and he leaned his cheek upon his hand it was clear
that his meditations were troublesome for at
least ten minutes he did not open his lips and smith
watched him anxiously at last he said speaking
slowly

  joseph this is the most trying problem that i
have had to solve the success of all my work de-
pends upon my not making a mistake now

  the burden of responsibility that rests on ray
shoulders is such as no mortal has ever borne it
is too great for human capacity-and yet how can i
cast it off

  i am to decide who shall be saved i i alone i
cosmo versal hold in my hands the fate of a race
numbering two thousand million souls the fate

of a planet which without my intervention would
become simply a vast tomb it is for vie to say
whether the genus homo shall be perpetuated and
in what form it shall bo perpetuated joseph this
is terrible these are the functions of deity not of
man

  joseph smith seemed no longer to breathe so
intense was his attention his eyes glowed under
the dark brows and his pencil trembled in his fin-
gers after a slight pause cosmo versal went on
if i felt any doubt that providence has fore-
ordained me to do this work and given me extra-
ordinary facilities and extraordinary knowledge
to enable me to perform it i would this instant
blow out my brains

again he was silent the secretary after fidgeting
about bending and unbending his brows and tap-
ping nervously upon the table at last said solemnly
cosmo you are ordained you must do the
work

  i must returned cosmo versal i know that
and yet the sense of my responsibility sometimes
covers me with a cloud of despair the other day
when the ark was crowded with curiosity seekers
the thought that not one of all those tens of thous-
ands could escape and that hundreds of millions of
others must also be lost overwhelmed me then i
began to reproach myself for not having been a
more effective agent in warning my fellows of
their peril joseph i have miserably failed i
ought to have produced universal conviction and i
have not done it

  it is not your fault cosmo said joseph smith
reaching out his long arm to touch his leaders
hand it is an unbelieving generation they have
rejected even the signs in the heavens tho voice
of an archangel would not have convinced them
it is true replied cosmo and the truth is
the more bitter to me because i spoke in the name
of science and the very men who represent science
have been my most determined opponents blinding
the peoples eyes-after wilfully shutting their
own

  you say you have been weak interposed smith
which you have not been but you would be weak
if you now shrank from your plain duty

  true cried cosmo in a changed voice let
us then proceed i had a lesson the other day
amos blank came to me puffed with his pillaged
millions i saw then what i had to do i told him
plainly that he was not among the chosen hand
me that book

  the secretary pushed a large volume within
cosmos reach he opened it it was a tear-
book of science politics sociology history and
government

  cosmo ran over its pages stopping to read a few
lines here and there seeming to make mental notes
after a while he pushed the book aside looked at
his companion thoughtfully and began

  the trouble with the world is that morally and
physically it has for thousands of years grown more
and more corrupt the flower of civilization about
which people boast so much nods over the stagnant
waters of a moral swamp and draws its perilous
beauty from the poisons of the miasma

  the nebula in drowning the earth brings op-
the second deluge



portunity for a new birth of mankind you will
remember joseph that the same conditions are said
to have prevailed in the time of noah there was
no science then and we do not know exactly on what
principles the choice was made of those who should
escape but the simple history of noah shows that
he and his friends represented the best manhood of
that age

  but the seeds of corruption were not eliminated
and the same problem recurs today

  i have to determine whom i will save i attack
the question by inquiring who represent the best
elements of humanity let us first consider men
by classes

  and why not by races asked smith

  i shall not look to see whether a man is black
white or yellow whether his skull is brachycephalic
or dolichocephalic replied cosmo i shall look
inside no race has ever shown itself permanently
the best

  then by classes you mean occupations

  well yes for the occupation shows the tendency
the quintessence of character some men are born
rulers and leaders others are born followers both
are necessary and i must have both kinds

  you will begin perhaps withthe kings the presi-
dents 

  not at all i shall begin with men of science
they are the true leaders

  but they have betrayed you-they have shut
their eyes and blindfolded others objected joseph
smith

  you do not understand me said cosmo with a
commiserating smile if my scientific brethren
have not seen as clearly as i have the fault lies not
in science but in lack of comprehension never-
theless they are on the right track they have the
gist of the matter in them they are trained in the
right method if i should leave them out the re-
generated world would start-a thousand years be-
hind time besides many of them are not so blind
some of them have got a glimpse of the truth

  not such men as pludder said smith

  all the same i am going to save pludder said
cosmo versal

  joseph smith fairly jumped with astonishment
you-are-going-to-save-pludder he fal-
tered but he is the worst of all

  not from my present view-point pludder has
a good brain he can handle the tools he is intel-
lectually honest he has done great things for sci-
ence in the past and besides i do not conceal from
you the fact that i should like to see him convicted
out of his own mouth

  but persisted smith i have heard you say
that he was-

  no matter what you have heard me say inter-
rupted cosmo impatiently i say now that he shall
go with us put down his name at the head of the
list

  dumfounded and muttering under his breath
smith obeyed

  i can take exactly one thousand individuals ex-
clusive of the crew continued versal paying no
attention to his confidants repeated shaking of his
head good heavens think of that one thou-
band put of two thousand millions but so be it

nobody would listen to me and now it is too late-
i must fix the number for each class

  there is one thing-one curious question-that
occurs to me put in smith hesitatingly what
about families

  there youve hit it cried cosmo thats ex-
actly what bothers me there must be as many
women as men-that goes without saying then
too the strongest moral element is in the women
although they dont weigh heavily for science but
the aged people and the children-theres the dif-
ficulty if i invite a man who possesses unquestion-
able qualifications but has a large family what am

i	to do i cant crowd out others as desirable as he
for the sake of carrying all of his stripes the
principles of eugenics demand a wide field of selec-
tion

  cosmo versal covered his eyes rested his big
head on his hands and his elbows on the table
presently he looked up with an air of decision

  i see what i must do he said i can take only
four persons belonging to any one family two of
them may be children-a man his wife and two
children-no more

  but that will be very hard lines for them- be-
gan joseph smith

  hard lines cosmo broke in do you think it
is easy lines for me good heavens man i am
forced to this decision it rends my heart to think
of it but i cant avoid the responsibility

  smith dropped his eyes and cosmo resumed his
reflections in a little while he spoke again
another thing that i must fix is an age limit
but that will have to be subject to certain excep-
tions very aged persons in general will not do-
they could not survive the long voyage and only in
the rare instances where their experience of life
might be valuable would they serve any good pur-
pose in reestablishing the race children are in-
dispensable-but they must not be too young--in-
fants in arms would not do at all oh this is sorry
work but i must harden ihy heart

  joseph smith looked at his chief and felt a
twinge of sympathy tempered by admiration for
he saw clearly the terrible contest in his friends
mind and appreciated the heroic nature of the de-
cision to which the inexorable logic of facts had
driven it

  cosmo versal was again silent for a long time
finally he appeared to throw off the incubus and
with a return of his ordinary decisiveness ex-
claimed 

  enough i have settled the general principle
now to the choice

  then closing his eyes as if to assist his memory
he ran over a list of names well known in the world
of science and smith set them down in a long row
under the name of abiel pludder with which he
had begun

  at last cosmo versl ceased his dictation
there he said that is the end of that cate-
gory i may add to or subtract from it later ac-
cording to probability making allowance for bach-
elors each name will represent three persons there
are seventy-five names which means two hundred
and twenty-five places reserved for science i will

 now make a series of other categories and assign the
 number of places for each

 he seized a sheet of paper and fell to work while
 smith looked on drumming with his fingers and
 contorting his huge black eyebrows for half an
 hour complete silence reigned broken only by the
 scratching of cosmo versaps pencil at the end of
 that time he threw down the pencil and held out the
 paper to his companion

 of course he said this is not a complete list
 of human occupations i have set down the prin-
 cipal ones as they occurred to me there will be
 time to correct any oversight read it

 smith by force of habit read it aloud

 no of probable no

 several times while joseph smith was reading
 he raised his eyebrows as if in surprise or mental
 protest but made no remark

 now resumed cosmo when the secretary had
 finished let us begin with the rulers i do not
 know them as intimately as i know the men of
 science but i am sure i have given them places
 enough suppose you take this book and call them
 over to me

 smith opened the year-book and began
 george washington samson president of the
 united states

 he goes he is not intellectually brilliant but
 he has strong sense and good moral fiber ill save
 him if for no other reason than his veto of the ant-
 arctic continent grab bill

 shcn su son of heaven emperor of china
 put him down i like him he is a true con-
 fucian

 joseph smith read off several other names at
 which cosmo shook his head then he came to
 richard edward by the grace of god king of
 great-

 enough broke in cosmo we all know him-
 the man who has done more for peace by putting
 half the british navy out of commission than any
 other ruler in history i cant leave him out
 achille dumont president of the french repub-
 lic

 will you take him

 admitted for he has at last done his part td feet
 the war microbe out of the human system

  then followed a number of rulers who were not
lucky enough to meet with cosmo versals approval

  the selection was continued until fifteen names
had been obtained including that of the new dark-
skinned president of liberia and cosmo declared
that he would not add another one

  then came the ten statesmen who were chosen
with utter disregard to racial and national lines

  in selecting his ten business magnates cosmo
stated his rule

  i exclude no man simply because he is a billion-
aire i consider the way he made his money the
world must always have rich men how could i
have built the ark if i had been poor 
philanthropists read smith

  i should have taken a hundred if i could have
found them said cosmo there are plenty of
candidates but these five-naming them-are the
only genuine ones and i am doubtful about several
of them but i must run some chances philan-
thropy being indispensable

  for the fifteen representatives of art cosmo con-
fined his selection largely to architecture

  the building instinct must be preserved he
explained one of the first things we shall need
after the flood recedes is a variety of all kinds of
structures but its a pretty bad lot at the best i
shall try to reform their ideas during the voyage
as to the other artists they too will need some
hints that i can give them and that they can trans-
mit to their children

  under the head of religious teachers cosmo re-
marked that he had tried to be fair to all forms of
genuine faith that had a large following the
school-teachers represented the principal languages
and cosmo selected the names from a volume on
the educational systems of the world remark-
ing that he ran some risk here but it could not be
avoided

  doctors-they get a rather liberal allowance
dont they asked smith

  not half as large as id like to have it was the
response the doctors are the salt of the earth
it breaks my heart to have to leave out so many
whose worth i know

  and only one lawyer pursued joseph thats
curious

  not in the least curious do you think i want
to scatter broadcast the seeds of litigation in a re-
generated world put down the name of chief jus-
tice good of the united states supreme court hell
see that equity prevails

  and only six writers continued smith

  and thats probably too many said cosmo
set down under that head peter inkson whom i
will engage to record the last scenes on the drown-
ing earth james henry blackwitt who will tell tho
story of the voyage jules bourgeois who can de-
scribe the personnel of the passengers sergius
narishkoff who will make a study of their psy-
chology and nicolao ludolfo whose description of
the ark will be an invaluable historic document a
thousand years hence

  and no novelists persisted the secretary
they will spring up thicker than weeds before
the waters are half gone-at least they would if i
let one aboard the ark

  editors-two

  thats right and two too many perhaps ill
take jinks of the thunderer and bullock of the
owl

  but both of them have persistently called you
an idiot

  for that reason i want them no world could
get along without some real idiots

  i am rather surprised at the next entry if you
will permit me to speak of it said joseph smith
here are forty-two places reserved for players
that means twenty-eight adults and probably
some youngsters who will be able to take parts
returned cosmo rubbing his hands with a satis-
fied smile i have taken as many players as i
conscientiously could not only because of their
future value but because they will do more than
anything else to keep up the spirits of everybody
in the ark i shall have a stage set in the largest
saloon

  joseph smith scowled but held his peace then
glancing again at the paper he remarked that
there was but one philosopher to be provided for

  it is easy to name him said cosmo kant
jacobi leergeschwatz

  why he

  because he will harmlessly represent the meta-
physical genus for nobody will ever understand
him

  musicians twelve

  chosen for the same reason as the players
said cosmo rapidly writing down twelve names
because they were not easy to pronounce and
handing them to smith who duly copied them off

  when this was done cosmo himself called out
the next category- speculative geniuses 

  i mean by that he continued not wall street
speculators but foreseeing men who possess the
gift of comprehending the seeds of time but who
never get a hearing in their own day and are hardly
ever remembered by future ages which enjoy the
fruits whose buds they recognized

  cosmo mentioned two names which joseph
smith had never heard and told him they ought
to be written in golden ink

  they are sui generis and alone in the world
they are the most precious cargo i shall have
aboard he added

  smith shrugged his shoulders and stared blank-
ly at the paper while cosmo sank into a reverie
finally the secretary said smiling with evident
approval this time

   society zero

  precisely for what does society represent ex-
cept its own vanity

  and then comes agriculture and mechanics
for this category cosmo seemed to be quite as
well prepared as for that of science he took from
his pocket a list already made out and handed it to
joseph smith it contained forty names marked
cultivators farmers gardeners and fifty me-
chanics	i
at the beginning of the twentieth century he

said i should have had to reverse that propor-
tion-in fact my entire list would then have been
top-heavy and i should have been forced to give
half of all the places to agriculture but thanks to
our scientific farming the personnel employed in
cultivation is now reduced to a minimum while
showing ihaximum results i have already stored
the ark with seeds of the latest scientifically de-
veloped plants and with all the needed implements
and machinery

  there yet remain thirteen places specially re-
served  said smith referring to the paper

  i shall fill those later responded cosmo and
then added with a thoughtful look i have some
humble friends

  the next thing he continued after a pause
is to prepare the letters of invitation but we
have done enough for tonight  i will give you the
form to-morrow

  and all this while half the world had been peace-
fully sleeping and the other half going about its
business more and more forgetful of recent events
and if it had known what those two men were
about it would probably have exploded in a gust
of laughter

chapter vii

the waters begin to rise

cosmo versal had begun the construction
of his ark in the latter part of june it
was now the end of november the
terrors of the third sign had occurred in septem-
ber since then the sky had nearly resumed its
normal color there had been no storms but the
heat of summer had not relaxed people were puz-
zled by the absence of the usual indications of
autumn although vegetation had shriveled on ac-
count of the persistent high temperature and con-
stant sunshine

  an extraordinary year admitted the meteor-
ologists but there have been warm autumns be-
fore and it is simply a question of degree nature
will restore the balance and in good time and prob-
ably we shall have a severe winter

  on the th of november the brassy sky at
new york showed no signs of change when the
following despatch which most of the newspapers
triple-leaded and capped with stunning head-iines
quivered down from churchill keewatin

    during last night the level of the water in
  hudson bay rose fully nine feet consterna-
  tion reigned this morning when ship-owners
  found their wharves inundated and vessels
  straining at short cables the ice-breaker
  victoria was lifted on the back of a sandy
  bar having apparently been driven by a heavy
  wave which must have come from the east
  there are other indications that the mysterious
  rise began with a bore from the eastward

  it is thought that the vast mass of icebergs
  set afloat on daviss strait by the long con-
  tinued hot weather melting the shore glaciers
  has caused a jam off the mouth of hudson
  strait and turned the polar current suddenly
  into the bay but this is only a theory a
  further rise is anticipated

  startling as was this news it might not by itself
have greatly disturbed the public mind if it had not
been followed in a few hours by intelligence of
immense floods in alaska and in the basin of the
mackenzie river

  and the next day an etherogram from obdorsk
bordered on the grotesque and filled many sen-
sitive readers with horror

  it was said that in the vast tundra regions of
northern siberia the frozen soil had dissolved into
a bottomless slough from whose depths uprose
prehistoric mammoths their long hair matted with
mud and their curved tusks of ivory gleaming like
trumpets over the field of their resurrection the
despatch concluded with a heart-rending account of
the loss of a large party of ivory hunters who hav-
ing ventured too far from the more solid land sud-
denly found the ground turning to black ooze be-
neath their feet and despite their struggles were
all engulfed within sight of their friends who dared
not try to approach them

  cosmo versal when interviewed calmly remark-
ed that the flood was beginning in the north be-
cause it was the northern part of the globe that
was nearest the heart of the nebula the motion
of the earth being northward that end of its axis
resembled the prow of a ship

  but this he added is hot the true deluge
the arctic ice-cap is melting and the frozen soil
is turning into a sponge in consequence of the heat
of friction developed in the air by the inrush of
nebulous matter the aqueous vapor however has
not yet touched the earth it will begin to mani-
fest its presence within a few days and then the
globe will drink water at every pore the vapor
will finally condense into falling oceans

  what would you advise people to do asked one
of the reporters

  the reply was given in a perfectly even voice
without change of countenance

  co-mmit suicide they have practically done
that already

  it was nearly two weeks later when the first
signs of a change of weather were manifested in
middle latitudes it came on with a rapid veiling
of the sky followed by a thin misty persistent rain
the heat grew more oppressive but the rain did
not become heavier and after a few days there
would be for several consecutive hours a clear
spell during which the sun would shine though
with a sickly pallid light

  there was a great deal of mystification abroad
and nobody felt at ease still the ebullitions of
terror that had accompanied the earlier caprices of
the elements were not renewed people were get-
ting used to these freaks

  in the middle of one of the clear spells a remark-
able scene occurred at mineola

  it was like a panorama of the seventh chapter of
genesis

  it was the procession of the beasts

  cosmo versal had concluded that the time was
come for housing his animals in the ark he wished
to accustom them to their quarters before the
voyage began the resulting spectacle filled the
juvenile world with irrespressible joy and im-
mensely interested their elders

  no march of a menagerie had ever come within
sight of equaling this display many of the beasts
were such as no one there had ever seen before
cosmo had consulted experts but in the end he
had been guided in his choice by his own judgment
nobody knew as well as he exactly what was wanted
he had developed in his mind a scheme for making
the new world that was to emerge from the waters
better in every respect than the old one

  mingled with such familiar creatures as sheep
cows dogs and barn-yard fowls were animals of
the past which the majority of the onlookers had
only read about or seen pictures of or perhaps in a
few cases had been told of in childhood by grand-
fathers long since sleeping in their graves

  cosmo had rapidly collected them from all parts
of the world but as they arrived in small con-
signments and were carried in closed vans very
few persons had any idea of what he was doing

  the greatest sensation was produced by four
beautiful horses which had been purchased at an
enormous price from an english duke who never
would have parted with them-for they were al-
most the last living representatives of the equine
race left on the earth-if financial stress had not
compelled the sacrifice

  these splendid animals were dapple gray with
long white tails and flowing manes borne proudly
on their arching necks and as they were led at the
head of the procession snorting at the unwonted
scene about them their eyes bright with excitement
prancing and curvetting cries of admiration and
rounds of applause broke from the constantly grow-
ing throngs of spectators

  those who had only known the horse from pic-
tures and sculptures were filled with astonishment
by its living beauty people could not help saying
to themselves

  what a pity that the honking auto in its hun-
dred forms of mechanical ugliness should have
driven these beautiful and powerful creatures out
of the world what could our forefathers have
been thinking of

  a few elephants collected from african zoological
gardens and some giraffes also attracted a great
deal of attention but the horses were the favorites
with the crowd

  cosmo might have had lions and tigers and simi-
lar beasts which had been preserved in larger num-
bers than the useful horses but when joseph smith
suggested their inclusion he shook his head de-
claring that it was better that they should perish
as far as possible he averred he would eliminate
all carnivores

  in some respects even more interesting to the
onlookers than the animals of the past were the
animals of the future that marched in the proces-
sion few of them had even been seen outside the
experimental stations where they had been under-
going the process of artificial evolution

  there were the stately white californian cattle
without horns but of gigantic stature the cows
it was said being capable of producing twenty
times more milk than their ancestral species and a
vastly superior quality

  there were the australian rabbits as large as
newfoundland dogs though short-legged and fur-
the second deluge



nishing food of the most exquisite flavor and the
argentine sheep great balls of snowy wool moving
smartly along on legs three feet in length

  the greatest astonishment was excited by the
grand astoria terrapin a developed species of
diamond-back tortoise whose exquisitely sculptured
convex back lurching awkwardly as it crawled rose
almost three feet above the ground and the new
century turkey which carried its beacon head and
staring eyes as high as a tall mans hat

  the end of the procession was formed of animals
familiar to everybody and among them were cages
of monkeys concerning whose educational develop-
ment-cosmo versal had theories of his own and a
large variety of birds together with boxes of in-
sect eggs and chrysalises

  the delight of the boys who had chased after the
procession culminated when the animals began to
ascend the sloping ways into the ark

  the horses shied and danced making the metallic
flooring resound like a rattle of thunder the ele-
phants trumpeted the sheep baaed and crowded
themselves into inextricable masses against the
guard-rails the huge new cattle moved lumberingly
up the slope turning their big white heads inquir-
ingly about the tall turkeys stretched their red
coral necks and gobbled with brobdingnagian
voices and the great terrapins were ignominiously
attached to cables and drawn up the side of the ark
helplessly waving their immense flappers in the air

  and when the sensational entry was finished the
satisfied crowd turned away laughing joking chat-
tering with never a thought that it was anything
more than the most amusing exhibition they had
ever seen i

  but when they got back in the city streets they
met a flying squadron of yelling newsboys and
seizing the papers from their hands read in big
black letters

 awful flood in the mississippi

thousands of people drowned

the storm coming this way

  it was a startling commentary on the recent scene
at the ark and many turned pale as they read

  but the storm did not come in the way expected
the deluging rains appeared to be confined to the
middle west and the northwest while at new york
the sky simply grew thicker and seemed to squeeze
out moisture in the form of watery dust this con-
dition lasted for some time and then came what
everybody even the most skeptical had been secret-
ly dreading

  the ocean began to rise

  the first perception of this startling fact accord-
ing to a newspaper account came in a very strange
roundabout way to a man living on the outskirts
of the vast area of made ground where the great
city had spread over what was formerly the newark
meadows and newark bay

  about three oclock in the morning this man who
it appears was a policeman off duty was awakened
by scurrying sounds in the house he struck a
light and seeing dark forms issuing from the cel-

lar went down to investigate the ominous gleam
of water reflecting the light of his lamp told him
that the cellar was inundated almost to the top of
the walls

  come down here annie he shouted to his wife
sure tis coshrno versal-al is invadin the cellar
with his flood the rats are lavin us

  seeing that the slight foundation walls were
crumbling he hurried his family into the street
and not too soon for within ten minutes the house
was in ruins

  neighbors living in equally frail structures were
awakened and soon other undermined houses fell
terror spread through the quarter and gradually
half the city was aroused

  when day broke residents along the water-front
in manhattan found their cellars flooded and south
and west streets swimming with water which was
continually rising it was noted that the hour was
that of flood tide but nobody had ever heard of a
tide so high as this

  alarm deepened into terror when the time for the
tide to ebb arrived and there was no ebbing on
the contrary the water continued to rise the
government observer at the highlands telephoned
that sandy hook was submerged soon it was
known that coney island rockaway and all the
seaside places along the south shore of long island
were under water the mighty current poured in
through the narrows with the velocity of a mill-
race the hudson set backward on its course
rushed northward with a raging bore at its head
that swelled higher until it licked the feet of the
rock chimneys of the palisades

  but when the terror inspired by this sudden in-
vasion from the sea was at its height there came
unexpected relief the water began to fall more
rapidly than it had risen it rushed out through
the narrows faster than it had rushed in and ships
dragged from their anchorage in the upper harbor
were carried out seaward some being stranded on
the sand-banks and shoals in the lower bay

  now again houses standing on made ground
whose foundations had been undermined fell with a
crash and many were buried in the ruins

  notwithstanding the immense damage and loss
of life the recession of the waters immediately had
a reassuring effect and the public in general was
disposed to be comforted by the explanation of the
weather officials who declared that what had oc-
curred was nothing more than an unprecedentedly
high tide probably respiting from some unfore-
seen disturbance out at sea

  the phenomenon had been noted all along the
atlantic coast the chief forecaster ventured the
assertion that a volcanic eruption had occurred
somewhere on the line from halifax to bermuda
he thought that the probable location of the up-
heaval had been at munns reef about half-way be-
tween those points and the more he discussed his
theory the readier he became to stake his reputation
on its correctness for he said it was impossible
that any combination of the effects of high and low
pressures could have created such a surge of the
ocean while a volcanic wave combining with the
regular oscillation of the tide could have done it
easily


amazing stories

  but cosmo versl smiled at this explanation and
said in reply

  the whole arctic ice-cap is dissolved and the
condensation of the nebula is at hand but there
is worse behind when the waves come back it will
rise higher

  as the time for the next flood-tide grew near
anxious eyes were on the watch to see how high
the water would go there was something in the
mere manner of its approach that made the nerves
tingle

  it speeded toward the beaches combing into
rollers at an unwonted distance from shore plunged
with savage violence upon the sands of the shallows
as if it would annihilate them and then spreading
swiftly ran with terrific speed up the strand seem-
ing to devour everything it touched after each
recoil it sprang higher and roared louder and grew
blacker with the mud that it had ground up from
the bottom miles inland the ground trembled with
the fast-repeated shocks

  again the hudson was hurled backward until a
huge bore of water burst over the wharves at al-
bany every foot of ground in new york less than
twenty feet above the mean high tide level was
inundated the destruction was enormous incalcul-
able ocean liners moored along the wharves were
in some cases lifted above the level of the neighbor-
ing streets and sent crashing into the buildings
along the water-front

  etherograms told in broken sentences of similar
experiences on the western coasts of europe and
from the pacific came the news of the flooding of
san francisco los angeles portland tacoma
seattle and every coast-lying town on the western
coast of south america the incoming waves broke
among the foot-hills of the andes

  it was as if the mighty basins of the worlds
two greatest oceans w-ere being rocked to and fro
sending the waters spinning from side to side

  and to add to the horror of the situation every
volcano on the globe seemed to burst simultaneously
into activity probably through the effects of the
invasion of sea-water into the subterranean incan-
descence while the strain of the unwonted weight
thrown upon the coasts broke open the tectonic
lines of weakness in the earths crust causing the
most terrible earthquakes which destroyed much
that the water could not reach

  from alaska to patagonia from kamchatka
through japan to the east indies fi-om mount
hekla to vesuvius etna and teneriffe the raging
oceans were bordered with pouring clouds of vol-
canic smoke hurled upward in swift succeeding
puffs as if every crater had become the stack of
a stupendous steam-engine driven at its mad-
dest speed while immense rivers of lava flamed
down the mountain flanks and plunged into the
invading waters with reverberated roarings hiss-
ings and explosions that seemed to shake the frame-
work of the globe

  during the second awful shoreward heave of
the atlantic a scene occurred off new york bay
that made the stoutest nerves quiver a great
crowd had collected on the highlands of the nave-
sink to watch the ingress of the tidal wave

  suddenly afar off the smoke of an approaching

ocean liner was seen it needed but a glance to
show that she was struggling with tremendous
surges sometimes she sank completely out of sight
then she reappeared riding high on the waves
those who had glasses recognized her word ran
from mouth to mouth that it was the great atlantis
the mightiest of the ocean monarchs of a hundred
thousand tons register coming from europe and
bearing without question many thousands of souls
she was flying signals of distress and filling the
ether with her inarticulate calls for help which
quavered into every radiograph station within a
radius of hundreds of miles

  but at the same time she was battling nobly for
herself and for the lives of her passengers and crew
from her main peak the stars and stripes streamed
in the tearing wind there were many in the watch-
ing throngs who personally knew her commander
captain basil brown and who felt that if any hu-
man being could bring the laboring ship through
safely he could aid from land was not to be
thought of

  as she swiftly drew nearer hurled onward by the
resistless surges with the speed of an express-train
the captain was recognized on his bridge balancing
himself amid the lurches of the vessel and even at
that distance and in those terrible circumstances
there was something in his bearing perceptible to
those who breathlessly watched him through power-
ful glasses which spoke of perfect self-command
entire absence of fear and iron determination to
save his ship or die with her under his feet

  it could be seen that he was issuing orders and
watching their execution but precisely what their
nature was of course could only be guessed his
sole hope must be to keep the vessel from being
cast ashore there was no danger from the shoals
for they were by this time deeply covered by the
swelling of the sea

  slowly slowly with a terrific straining of me-
chanic energies which pressed the jaws of the
watchers together with spasmodic sympathy as if
their own nervous power were cooperating in the
struggle the gallant ship bore her head round to
face the driving waves from the ten huge red
stacks columns of inky black smoke poured out as
the stokers crammed the furnaces beneath it was
man against nature human nerve and mechanical
science against blind force

  it began to look as if the atlantis would win the
battle she was now fearfully close to the shore but
her bow had been turned into the very eye of the
sea and one could almost feel the tension of her
steel muscles as she seemed to spring to the en-
counter the billows that split themselves in quick
succession on her sharp stem burst into shooting
geysers three hundred feet high

  the hearts of the spectators almost ceased to
beat their souls were wrapped up with the fate
of the brave ship they forgot the terrors of their
own situation the peril of the coming flood and saw
nothing but the agonized struggle before their eyes
with all their inward strength they prayed against
the ocean

  such a contest could not last long suddenly as
the atlantis swerved a little aside a surge that
towered above her loftiest deck rushed upon her
the second deluge



she was lifted like a cockleshell upon its crest her
huge hull spun around and the next minute with
a crash that resounded above the roar of the mad-
dened sea she was dashed in pieces

  at the very last moment before the vessel dis-
appeared in the whirling breakers to be strewed
in broken and twisted bits of battered metal upon
the pounding sands captain basil brown was seen
on the commanders bridge

  no sooner had this tragedy passed than the pent-
up terror broke forth and men ran for their lives
ran for their homes ran to do something-some-
thing but what-to save themselves and their
dear ones

  for now at last they believed

            chapter viii
            storming the ark

there was to be no more respite now the
time of warnings was past the signs
had all been shown to a skeptical and vacillat-
ing world and at last the fulfilment was at hand

  there was no crying of extras in the streets
for men had something more pressing to think of
than sending and reading news about their dis-
tresses and those of their fellow men every news-
paper ceased publication every business place was
abandoned there was no thought but of the means
of escape

  but how should they escape and whither should
they fly

  the lower lying streets were under water the
atlantic still surged back and forth as if the ocean
itself were in agony and every time the waves
poured inthey rose higher the new shores of the
bay and the new coasts of long island and new
jersey receding inward hour by hour were strewn
with the wrecks of hundreds of vessels of all kinds
which had been caught by the surges and pitilessly
hurled to destruction

  even if men did not yet fully believe in cosmo
versals theory of a whelming nebula they were
terrified to the bottom of their souls by the con-
viction which nobody could resist that the vast
ice-fields of the north the glaciers of greenland
the icy mountains of alaska had melted away
under the terrible downpour of heat and were swell-
ing the oceans over their brims and then a greater
fear dropped like a blanket upon them some one
thought of the antarctic ice

  the latest despatches that had come before the
cessation of all communication to the newspapers
had told of the prevalence of stifling heat through-
out the southern hemisphere and of the vast fleets
of antarctic icebergs that filled the south sea the
mighty deposits of ice towering to mountain
heights that stretched a thousand miles in every
direction around the south pole were melting as the
arctic ice had melted and when the water thus
formed was added to the already overflowing seas
to what elevation might not the flood attain

  the antarctic ice was known to be the principal
mass of frozen water on the globe the frigid cap
of the north was nothing in comparison with it
it had long been believed that the weight of that
tremendous accumulation unbalanced the globe and

was the chief cause of the unsteadiness of the
earths axis of rotation

  every fresh exploration had only served to
magnify the conception of the incredible vastness
of that deposit the skirts of the antarctic con-
tinent had proved to be rich in minerals wherever
the rocks could find a place to penetrate through
the gigantic burden of ice and the principal nations
had quarreled over the possession or control of these
protruding bits of wealth-crammed strata but be-
hind the bordering cliffs of ice rising in places a
thousand feet above the level of the sea and tower-
ing farther inland so high that this region became
in mean elevation the loftiest on the planet nothing
but ice could be seen

  and now that ice was dissolving and flowing into
the swollen oceans adding billions of tons of water
every minute

  men did not stop to calculate as cosmo versal
had done just how much the dissolution of all the
ice and permanent snow of the globe would add to
the volume of the seas he knew that it would be
but a drop in the bucket-although sufficient to
start the flood-and that the great thing to be
feared was the condensation of the aqueous nebula
already beginning to enwrap the planet in its stifl-
ing folds

  the public could understand the melting ice al-
though it could not fully understand the nebula it
could understand the swelling sea and the raging
rivers and the lakes breaking over their banks-s
and the terror and despair became universal

  but what should they do

  those who had thought of building arks hur-
ried to see if the work might not yet be completed
but most of them had begun their foundations on
low land which was already submerged

  then a cry arose terrible in its significance and
in its consequences-one of those cries that the van-
ished but unconquerable god pan occasionally sets
ring nobody can tell how

  cosmos ark get aboard storm it

  and thereupon there was a mighty rush for
mineola nobody who caught the infection stopped
to reason some of them had to wade through
water which in places was knee-deep they came
from various directions and united in a yelling
mob they meant to carry the ark with a rush
they would not be denied as the excited throngs
neared the great vessel they saw its huge form ris-
ing like a mount of safety with an american flag
flapping about it and they broke into a mighty
cheer on they sped seized with the unreason of a
crowd shouting falling over one another strug-
gling fighting for places men dragging their
wives and children through the awful crush many
trampled helpless under the myriads of struggling
feet-driving the last traces of sanity from one an-
others minds

  the foremost ranks presently spied cosmo versl
watching them from an open gangway sixty feet
above their heads they were dismayed at finding
the approaches gone how should they get into the
ark how could they climb up its vertical sides

  but they would find means they would re-erect
the approaches they would get in somehow

  cosmo waved them off with frantic gesticula-




amazing stories

tions then through a trumpet he shouted in a
voice audible above the din

  keep back for your lives

  but they paid no attention to him they rushed
upon the raised wall surrounding the field where
cosmo had buried his mysterious lines of wire
then the meaning of that enigmatical work was
flashed upon them

  as the first arrivals laid their hands upon the
top of the low wall they fell as if shot through the
brain tumbling backward on those behind others
pushed wildly on but the instant they touched the
wall they too collapsed wicked blue-green sparks
occasionally flashed above the struggling mass

  the explanation was clear cosmo foreseeing
the probability of a despairing attack had sur-
rounded the ark with an impassable electric barrier
the sound of a whirring dynamo could be heard a
tremendous current was flowing through the hidden
wires and transmitting its paralyzing energy to the
metallic crest of the wall

  still those behind pushed on until rank after
rank had sunk helpless at the impregnable line of
defense they were not killed-at least not many
-but the shock was so paralyzing that those who
had experienced its effect made no further at-
tempts to cross the barrier many lay for a time
helpless upon the sodden ground

  cosmo and joseph smith who had now appeared
at his side continued to shout warnings which
began to be heeded when the nature of the obstacle
became known the rush was stopped and the
multitude stood at bay dazed and uncertain what
to do then a murmur arose growing louder and
more angry and threatening until suddenly a shot
was heard in the midst of the crowd and cosmo
was seen to start backward while joseph smith
instantly dodged out of sight

  a cry arose

  shoot him thats right shoot the devil
hes a witch hes drowning the world

  they meant it-at least half of them did it
was the logic of terror

  hundreds of shots were now fired from all
quarters and heads that had been seen flitting be-
hind the various portholes instantly disappeared
the bullets rattled on the huge sides of the ark
but they came from small pistols and had not force
enough to penetrate

  cosmo versal alone remained in sight occasion-
ally a quick motion showed that even his nerves
were not steady enough to defy the whistling of the
bullets passing close but he held his ground and
stretched out his hand to implore attention

  when the fusillade ceased for a moment he put
his trumpet again to his lips and shouted

  i have done my best to save you but you would
not listen although i know that you must perish
i would not myself harm a hair of your heads
go back i implore you you may prolong your
lives if you will fly to the highlands and the moun-
tains-but here you cannot enter the ark is full

  another volley of shots was the only answer
one broad-shouldered man forced his way to the
front took his stand close to the wall and yelled
in stentorian tones

  cosmo versal listen to me you are the curse
of the world you have brought this flood upon
us with your damnable incantations your in-
fernal nebula is the seal of satan here beast and
devil here at my feet lies my only son slaih by
your hellish device by the eternal i swear you
shall go back to the pit

  instantly a pistol flashed in the speakers hand
and five shots rang in quick succession one after
another they whistled by cosmos head and flatten-
ed themselves upon the metal-work behind cosmo
versal untouched folded his arms and looked
straight at his foe the man staring a moment
confusedly as if he could not comprehend his
failure threw up his arms with a despairing ges-
ture and fell prone upon the ground

  then yells and shots once more broke out cos-
mo stepped back and a great metallic door swung
to closing the gang-way

but three minutes later the door opened and
the mob saw two machine-guns trained upon them
once more cosmo appeared with the trumpet
if you fire again he cried i shall spray you
with bullets i have told you how you can pro-
long your lives now go

  not another shot was fired in the face of the
guns whose terrible power all comprehended no
one dared to make a hostile movement

  but perhaps if cosmo versal had not set new
thoughts running in the minds of the assailants by
telling them there was temporary safety to be
found by seeking high ground even the terror of
the guns would not have daunted them now their
hopefulness was reawakened and many began to
ponder upon his words

  he says we must perish and yet that we can
find safety in the hills and mountains said one
man i believe half of that is a lie we are not
going to be drowned the water wont rise much
higher the flood from the south pole that they
talk about must be here by this time and then
whats left to come

  the nebula suggested one

  aw the nebula be hanged theres no such
thing i live on high ground im going to keep
a sharp outlook and if the water begins to shut
off manhattan ill take my family up the hudson
to the highlands i guess old storm kingll keep
his head above thats where i come from-up
that way i used to hear people say when i vas
a boy that new york was bound to sink some day
i used to laugh at that then but it looks mighty
like it now dont it

  sayput in another what did the fellow
mean by saying the ark was full thats funny
aint it whos he got inside anyway

  oh he aint got nobody said another

  yes he has i seen a goodish lot through the
port-holes hes got somebody sure

  a lot of fools like himself most likely

  well if hes a fool and theys fools what are
we id like to know what did you come here
for hey

  it was a puzzling question followed by the re-
mark

  i guess we fooled ourselves considerable we
got scared too easy
the second deluge



  maybe youll feel scared again when you see
the water climbing up the streets in new york
i dont half like this thing im going to follow
his advice and light out for higher ground

  soon conversation of this sort was heard on all
sides and the crowd began to disperse only those
lingering behind who had friends or relatives that
had been struck down at the fatal wall it turned
out that not more than one or two had been mor-
tally shocked the rest were able to limp away and
many had fully recovered within five minutes after
suffering the shock in half an hour not a dozen
persons were in sight from the ark

  but when the retreating throngs drew near the
shores of the sound and the east river which
had expanded into a true arm of the sea and
found that there had been a perceptible rise since
they set out to capture the ark they began to shake
their heads and fear once more entered their
hearts

  thousands then and there resolved that they
would not lose another instant in setting out for
high land up the hudson in connecticut among
the hills of new jersey in fact many had al-
ready fled thither some escaping on aeros and
hosts would now have followed but for a marvelous
change that came just before nightfall and pre-
vented them

  for some days the heavens had alternately dark-
ened and lightened as gushes of mist came and
went but there had been no actual rain now
without warning a steady downpour began even
at the beginning it would have been called in or-
dinary times a veritable cloudburst but it rapid-
ly grew worse and worse until there was no word
in the vernacular or in the terminology of science
to describe it

  it seemed in truth that all the fountains of
the great deep were broken up and the windows of
heaven were opened the water thundered upon
the roofs and poured off them in torrents in five
minutes every sloping street had become an angry
river and every level place a swelling lake people
caught out of doors were almost beaten to the
ground by the force of the water falling upon them
as if they had been standing under a cataract

	in a short time every cellar and every base-
ment was filled to overflowing and in the avenues
the flood lapping every instant higher upon the
door-steps and the walls rushed by with frightful
roarings bearing in its awful embrace pieces of
furniture clothing bedding washed out of
ground-floor rooms-and alas human beings
some motionless already mercifully deprived of
life but others struggling and shouting for aid
which could not be given

  so terrible a spectacle no one had everlooked
tipon no one had ever imagined those who be-
held it were too stunned to cry out too overwhelmed
with terror and horror to utter a word they
stood or fell into chairs or upon the floor trem-
bling in every limb with staring eyes and droop-
ing jaws passively awaiting their fate

  as night came on there was no light the
awful darkness of the third sign once more set-
tled upon the great city but now it was not the
terror of indefinite expectation that crushed down

the souls of men and women-it was the weight
of doom accomplished

  there was no longer any room for self-deception
every quaking heart felt now that the nebula had
come cosmo versal had been right

  after the water had attained a certain height
in the street and yards depending upon the ratio
between the amount descending from the sky and
that which could find its way to the rivers the
flood for the time being rose no higher the
actual drowning of new york could not happen
until the hudson and the east river should be-
come so swollen that the water would stand above
the level of the highest buildings and turn the
whole region round about as far as the orange
hills the ramapo mountains the highland and
the housatonic hills into an inland sea

  but before we tell that story we must return to
see what was going on at mineola cosmo versal
on that awful night when new york first knew
beyond the shadow of a doubt or the gleam of a
hope that it was doomed presided over a remark-
able assembly in the grand saloon of his ark

the company of the reprieved

how did it happen that cosmo versal wai
able to inform the mob when it assailed
the ark that he had no room left

  who composed his ships company whence had
they come and how had they managed to embark
without the knowledge of the public

  the explanation is quite simple it was all due
to the tremendous excitement that had prevailed
ever since the sea began to overflow in the univer-
sal confusion people had to think of other things
nearer their dogrs than the operations of cosmo
versal sincethe embarkation of the animals the
crowds had ceased to visit the field at mineola and
it was only occasionally that even a reporter was
sent there accordingly there were many hours
every day when no curiosity-seekers were in sight
of the ark and at night the neighborhood was de-
serted  and this state of affairs continued until the
sudden panic which led to the attack that has been
described

  cosmo versal of course had every reason to
conceal the fact that he was carefully selecting
his company it was a dangerous game to play
and he knew it the consequence was that he en-
joined secrecy upon his invited guests and con-
ducted them a few at a time into the ark assuring
them that their lives might be in peril if they were
recognized and once under the domain of the
fear which led them to accept his invitation they
were no less anxious than he to avoid publicity
some of them probably desired to avoid recogni-
tion through dread of ridicule for after all the
flood might not turn out to be so bad as cosmo
had predicted

  so it happened that the ark was filled little by
little and the public knew nothing about it

and who composed the throng which while the
awful downpour roared on the ellipsoidal cover of-

i faccd these people facing my fate in them single-handed now-literally single-handed for i had a broken arm in my pockct was
a revolver with two empty chambers  i looked squarely into the faces of the advancing monsters they avoided my eyes
ond their quivering nostrils investigated the bodies that lay beyond mo on the beach i took hal-a-dozcn steps picked up the blood-
stained whip that lay beneath the body of the wolf-man and cracked it they stopped and stared at me


whai went before

the writer of this story is picked up on the
open ocean from a ships boat the ship hav-
ing been lost in a collision he is the only
living inmate of the boat and the vessel that picks
him up carries a strange crew of human beings as
well as of animals there seems to be some secrecy
about it but at last the ship reaches an island and
the animals are taken ashore and some of the is-
lands inmates who had been on the ship go with
them

our hero is put into the ships dingey and sent
adrift the boat from the ship however which is

going to the island takes hini in tow and he lands
and here his strange experiences begin on the
island he finds some experiments in vivisection and
the like apparently going on and he meets curious
beings who seem half animal half human the
mystery grows as he sees many of what he terms
beast-men he is in danger from some of them
dr moreau who is the head of the organization
whatever it may be inspires dread and the first
part of the story leaves the problem of what is
doing on the island quite unsolved

dr moreau explains

            nd now prendick i will explain said
 doctor moreau so soon as we had eaten
 and drunk i must confess that you
 are the most dictatorial guest i ever
 entertained i warn you that this is
 the last i shall do to oblige you the next thing
 you threaten to commit suicide about i shant do
 -even at some personal inconvenience

   he sat in my deck chair a cigar half consumed in
 his white dexterous-iooking fingers the light of
 the swinging lamp fell on his white hair he stared
 through the little window out at the starlight i
 sat as far away from him as possible the table be-
 tween us and the revolvers to hand montgomery
 was not present i did not care to be with the two
 of them in such a little room

   you admit that the
 vivisected human being
 as you called it is after
 all only the puma said
 moreau he had made
 me visit that horror in the
 inner room to assure my-
 self of its inhumanity

   it is the puma i
 said still alive but so
 cut and mutilated als i
 pray i may never see liv-
 ing flesh again of all
 vile-

   never mind that said
 moreau at least spare
 me those youthful horrors
 be just the same

   js you come to the second and final installment of this
 extraordinary story you surely will want to know
 how it all ends of course we are not going to tell
 you but you will find that the ending is just as extraordi-
 nary as the whole tale it will give you much food for
 thought to review this story even months or years after
 it has first been read it is of such quality as zvill leave
 a lasting impression which in these days is true of few
 stories we have aft idea that mr wells when he wrote
 this story did it as a travesty on humans and their thin
 coat of civilisation veneer thereby exposing the human
 race and its foibles if that was his intention he certainly
 succeeded

                          montgomery used to
 you admit that it is the puma
 now be quiet while i reel off my physiological lec-
 ture to you

   and forthwith beginning in the tone of a man
 supremely bored but presently warming a little he
 explained his work to me he was very simple
 and convincing now and then there was a touch
 of sarcasm in his voice presently i found myself
 hot with shame at our mutual positions

   the creatures i had seen were not men had never
 been men they were animals humanised animals

 -triumphs of vivisection

   you forget all that a skilled vivisector can do
 with living things said moreau for my own
 part im puzzled why the things i have done here
 have not been done before small efforts of course
 have been made-amputation tongue-cutting ex-
 cisions of course you know squint may be in-
 duced or cured by surgery then in the case of
 excisions you haveall kinds of secondary changes
 pigmentary disturbances modifications of the pas-
 sions alterations in the secretion of fatty tissue
 i have no doubt you have heard of these thing
 of course said i but these foul creatures
 of yours-

   all in good time said he waving his hand at
 me i am only beginning those are trivial cases
 of alteration surgery can do better things than
 that there is building up as well as breaking
 down and changing you have heard perhaps of
 a common surgical opera-
 tion resorted to in cases
 where the nose has been
 destroyed a flap of skin
 is cut from the forehead
 turned down on the nose
 and heals in the new posi-
 tion this is a kind of
 grafting in a new position
 of part of an animal ap-
 on itself grafting of
 freshly obtained material
 from another animal is al-
 so possible-the case of
 teeth for example the
 grafting of skin and bone
 is done to facilitate healing the surgeon places in
 the middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped
 from another animal or fragments of bone from a
 victim freshly killed hunters cockspur-possibly
 you have heard of that-flourished on the bulls
 neck and the rhinoceros rats of the algerian
 zouaves are also to be thought of-monsters manu-
 factured by transferring a slip from the tail of an
 ordinary rat to its snout and allowing it to heal
 in that position

   monsters manufactured
 mean to tell me-

 said i then you




amazing stories

  yes these creatures you have seen are animals
carven and wrought into new shapes to that to
the study of the plasticity of living forms my life
has been devoted i have studied for years gain-
ing in knowledge as i go i see you look horrified
and yet i am telling you nothing new it all lay
in the surface of practical anatomy years ago but
no one had the temerity to touch it its
not simply the outward form of an animal which
i can change the physiology the chemical rhythm
of the creature may also be made to undergo an
enduring modification-of which vaccination and
other methods of inoculation with living or dead
matter are examples that will no doubt be familiar
to you a similar operation is the transfusion of
blood-with which subjeot indeed i began these
are all familiar cases less so and probably far
more extensive were the operations of those mediae-
val practitioners who made dwarfs and beggar-crip-
ples show-monsters-some vestiges of whose art
still remain in the preliminary manipulation of the
young mountebank or contortionist victor hugo
gives an account of them in lhomme qui hit-
but perhaps ray meaning grows plain now you
begin to see that it is a possible thing to transplant
tissue from one part of an animal to another or
from one animal to another to alter its chemical
reactions and methods of growth to modify the
articulations of its limbs and indeed to change
it in its most intimate structure

  and yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge
has never been sought as an end and systematically
by modern investigators until i took it up some
of such things have been hit upon in the last re-
sort of surgery most of the kindred evidence that
will recur to your mind has been demonstrated as
it were by accident-by tyrants by criminals by
the breeders of horses and dogs by all kinds of un-
trained clumsy-handed men working for their own
immediate ends i was the first man to take up this
question armed with antiseptic surgery and with a
really scientific knowledge of the laws of growth
yet one would imagine it must have been practised
in secret before such creatures as the siamese
twins-and in the vaults of the inquisition no
doubt their chief aim was artistic torture but some
at least of the inquisitors must have had a touch of
scientific curiosity

  but said i these things-these animals talk

  he said that was so and proceeded to point out
that the possibility of vivisection does not stop at
a mere physical metamorphosis a pig may be
educated the mental structure is even less deter-
minate than the bodily in our growing science of
hypnotism we find the promise of a possibility of
superseding old inherent instincts by new sugges-
tions grafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed
ideas very much indeed of what we call moral
education ho said is such an artificial modification
and perversion of instinct pugnacity is trained in-
to courageous self-sacrifice and suppressed sexual-
ity into religious emotion and the great differ-
ence between man and monkey is in the larynx
he continued-in the incapacity to frame deli-
cately different sound-symbols by which thought
could be sustained in this i failed to agree with
him but with a certafh incivility he declined to

notice my objection he repeated that the thing
was so and continued his account of his work

  i asked him why he had taken the human form
as a model there seemed to me then and there
still seems to me now a strange wickedness for that
choice

  he confessed that he had chosen that form by
chance i might just as well have worked to form
sheep into llamas and llamas into sheep i suppose
there is something in the human form that appeals
to the artistic turn more powerfully than any
animal shape can but ive not confined myself to
man-making once or twice- he was silent for
a minute perhaps these years how they have
slipped by and here i have wasted a day saving
your life and am now wasting an hour explaining
myself

  but said i i still do not understand where
is your justification for inflicting all this pain
the only thing that could excuse vivisection to
me would be some application-

  precisely said he but you see i am differ-
ently constituted we are on different platforms
you are a materialist

  i am not a materialist i began hotly

  in my view-in my view for it is just this
question of pain that parts us so long as visible
or audible pain turns you sick so long as your own
pains drive you so long as pain underlies your pro- 
positions about sin- so long i tell you you are an 
animal thinking a little less obscurely what an
animal feels this pain-

  i gave an impatient shrug at such sophistry

  oh but it is such a little thing a mind truly
opened to what science has to teach must see that
it is a little thing it may be that save in this little
planet this speck of cosmic dust invisible long be-
fore the nearest star could be attained-it may be

i say that nowhere else does this thing called pain
occur but the laws we feel our way towards-
why even on this earth even among living things
what pain is there

  as he spoke he drew a little penknife from his
pocket opened the smaller blade and moved his
chair so that i could see his thigh then choosing
the place deliberately he drove the blade into his
leg and withdrew it

  no doubt he said you have seen that before
it does not hurt a pin-prick but what does it
show the capacity for pain is not needed in the
muscle and it is not placed there-is but little
needed in the skin and only here and there over the
thigh is a spot capable of feeling pain pain is
simply our intrinsic medical adviser to warn us
and stimulate us not all living flesh is painful
nor is all nerve not even all sensory nerve theres
no tint of pain real pain in the sensations of the
optic nerve if you wound the optic nerve you
merely see flashes of light-just as disease of the
auditory nerve merely means a humming in our
ears plants do not feel pain nor the lower ani-
mals  its possible that such animals as the starfish
and crayfish do not feel pain at all then with
men the more intelligent they become the more in-
telligently they will see after their own welfare
and the less they will need the goad to keep them
out of danger i never yet heard of a useless
the island of dr moreau



thing that was not ground out of existence by evo-
lution sooner or later did you and pain gets

needless

  then i am a religious man prendick as every
sane man must be it may be i fancy that i have
seen more of the ways of this worlds maker than
you-for i have sought his laws in my way all my
life while you i understand have been collecting
butterflies and i tell you pleasure and pain have
nothing to do with heaven or hell pleasure and
pain-bah what is your theologians ecstasy but
mahomets houri in the dark this store which men
and women set on pleasure and pain prendick is
the mark of the beast upon them-the mark of
the beast from which they came pain pain and
pleasure they are for us only so long as we wriggle
in the dust

  you see i went on with this research just the
way it led me that is the only way i ever heard of
true research going i asked a question devised
some method of obtaining an answer and got a
fresh question was this possible or that possible
you cannot imagine what this means to an in-
vestigator what an intellectual passion grows up-
on him you cannot imagine the strange colourless
delight of these intellectual desires the thing be-
fore you is no longer an animal a fellow-creature
but a problem sympathetic pain-all i know of it
i remember as a thing i used to suffer from years
ago i wanted-it was the one thing i wanted-to
find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a living
shape

  but said i the thing is an abomination-

  to this day i have never troubled about the
ethics of the matter he continued the study
of nature makes a man at last as remorseless as
nature i have gone on not heeding anything but
the question i was pursuing and the material has
-dripped into the huts yonder it is really eleven
years since we came here i and montgomery and
six kanakas i remember the green stillness of the
island and the empty ocean about us as though it
was yesterday the place seemed waiting for me

  the stores were landed and the house was
built the kanakas founded some huts near the
ravine i went to work here upon what i had
brought with me there were some disagreeable
things happened at first i began with a sheep and
killed it after a day and a half by a slip of the
scalpel i took another sheep and made a thing
of pain and fear and left it bound up to heal it
looked quite human to me when i had finished it
but when i went to it i was discontented with it
it remembered me and was terrified beyond
imagination and it had no more than the wits
of a sheep the more i looked at it the clumsier
it seemed until at last i put the monster out of its
misery these animals without courage these fear-
haunted pain-driven things without a spark of
pugnacious energy to face torment-they are no
good for man-making

  then i took a gorilla i had and upon that work-
ing with infinite care and mastering difficulty after
difficulty i made my first man all the week night
and day i moulded him with him it was chiefly
the brain that needed moulding much had to be
added much changed i thought him a fair speci-

men of the negroid type when i had finished him
and he lay bandaged bound and motionless before
me it was only when his life was assured that i
left him and came into this room again and found
montgomery much as you are he had heard some
of the cries as the thing grew human-cries like
those that disturbed you so i didnt take him
completely into my confidence at first and the
kanakas too had realised something of it they
were scared out of their wits by the sight of me
i got montgomery over to me-in a way but i
and he had the hardest job to prevent the kanakas
deserting finally they did and so we lost the
yacht i spent many days educating the brute-
altogether i had him for three or four months
i taught him the rudiments of english gave him
ideas of counting even made the thing read the
alphabet but at that he was slow though ive
met with idiots slower he began with a clean
sheet mentally had no memories left in his mind
of what he had been when his scars were quite
healed and he was no longer anything but painful
and stiff and able to converse a little i took him
yonder and introduced him to the kanakas as an
interesting stowaway

  they were horribly afraid of him at first some-
how-which offended me rather for i was con-
ceited about him but his ways seemed so mild and
he was so abject that after a time they received
him and took his education in hand he was quick
to learn very imitative and adaptive and built him-
self a hovel rather better it seemed to me than
their own shanties there was one among the boys
a bit of a missionary and he taught the thing to
read or at least to pick out letters and gave him
some rudimentary ideas of morality but it seems
the beasts habits were not all that is desirable

  i rested from work for some days after this and
was in a mind to write an account of the whole
affair to wake up english physiology then i came
upon the creature squatting up in a tree and gibber-
ing at two of the kanakas who had been teasing
him i threatened him told him the inhumanity of
such a proceeding aroused his sense of shame and
came home resolved to do better before i took my
work back to england i have been doing better
but somehow the things drift back again the stub-
born beast-flesh grows day by day back again but
i mean to do better things still i mean to conquer
that this puma-

  but thats the story all the kanaka boys are
dead now one fell overboard off the launch and one
died of a wounded heel that he poisoned in some
way with plant-juice three went away in the
yacht and i suppose and hope were drowned the
other one-was killed well i have replaced them
montgomery went on much as you are disposed to
do at first and then-

  what became of the other one said i sharply
-the other kanaka who was killed

  the fact is after i had made a number of hu-
man creatures i made a thing he hesitated

  yes said i

  it was killed

  i dont understand said i do you mean to
say-

  it killed the kanakas-yes it killed several


amazing stories

other things it caught we chased it for a couple
of days it only got loose by accident-i never
meant it to get away it wasnt finished it was
purely an experiment it was a limbless thing with
a horrible face that writhed along the ground in
a serpentine fashion it was immensely strong and
in infuriating pain it lurked in the woods for some
days until we hunted it and then it wriggled into
the northern part of the island and we divided
the party to close in upon it montgomery insisted
upon coming with me the man had a rifle and
when his body was found one of the barrels was
curved into the shape of an s and very nearly bit-
ten through montgomery shot the thing after
that i stuck to the ideal of humanity-except for
little things

  he became silent i sat in silence watching his
face

  so for twenty years altogether-counting nine
years in england-i have been going on and there
is still something in everything i do that defeats
me makes me dissatisfied challenges me to further
effort sometimes i rise above my level sometimes
i fall below it but always i fall short of the things
i dream the human shape i can get now almost
with ease so that it is lithe and graceful or thick
and strong but often there is trouble with the
hands and the claws-painful things that i dare
not shape too freely but it is in the subtle graft-
ing and reshaping one must needs do to the brain
that my trouble lies the intelligence is often odd-
ly low with unaccountable blank ends unexpected
gaps and least satisfactory of all is something
that i cannot touch somewhere-i cannot deter-
mine where-in the seat of the emotions cravings
instincts desires that harm humanity a strange
hidden reservoir to burst forth suddenly and inun-
date the whole being of the creature with anger
hate or fear these creatures of mine seemed
strange and uncanny to you so soon as you began
to observe them but to me just after i make them
they seem to be indisputably human beings its
afterwards as i observe them that the persuasion
fades first one animal trait then another creeps
to the surface and stares out at me but i will
conquer yet each time i dip a living creature into
the bath of burning pain i say this time i will
burn out all the animal this time i will make a
rational creature of my own after all what is
ten years men have been a hundred thousand in
the making he thought darkly but i am draw-
ing near the fastness this puma of mine- after
a silence and they revert as soon as my hand
is taken from them the beast begins to creep back
begins to assert itself again another long silence

  then you take the things you make into those
dens said i

  they go i turn them out when i begin to feel
the beast in them and presently they wander there
they all dread this house and me there is a kind
of travesty of humanity over there montgomery
knows about it for he interferes in their affairs
he has trained one or two of them to our service
hes ashamed of it but i believe he half likes some
of those beasts its his business not mine they
only sicken me with a sense of failure i take no
iotcrodt in there i fancy they follow in the lines

the kanaka missionary marked out and have a kind
of mockery of a rational life poor beasts theres
something they call the law sing hymns about
all thine they build themselves their dens
gathor fruit and pull herbs--marry even but i
can see through it all see into their very souls and
see there nothing but the souls of beasts beasts
that perish anger and the lusts to live and gratify
themselves-yet theyre odd complex like every-
thing else alive there is a kind of upward striving
in them part vanity part waste sexual emotion
part waste curiosity it only mocks me i have
some hope of that puma i have worked hard at
her head and brain-

  and now said he standing up after a long
gap of silence during which we had each pursued
our own thoughts what do you think are you
in fear of me still

  i looked at him and saw but a white-faced white-
haired man with calm eyes save for his serenity
the touch almost of beauty that resulted from his
set tranquillity and his magnificent build he might
have passed muster among a hundred other com-
fortable old gentlemen then i shivered by way
of answer to his second question i handed him a
revolver with either hand

  keep them he said and snatched at a yawn
he stood up stared at me for a moment and smiled
you have had two eventful days said he i
should advise some sleep im glad its all clear
good-night he thought me over for a moment
then went out by the inner door

  i immediately turned the key in the outer one
i sat down again sat for a time in a kind of
stagnant mood so weary emotionally mentally
and physically that i could not think beyond the
point at which he had left me the black window
stared at me like an eye at last with an effort i
put out the light and got into the hammock very
soon i was asleep

chapter xv
concerning the beast folk

i woke early moreaus explanation stood be-
fore my mind clear and definite from the
moment of my awakening i got out of the
hammock and went to the door to assure myself
that the key was turned then i tried the window-
bar and found it firmly fixed that these man-liko
creatures were in truth only bestial monsters mere
grotesque travesties of men filled me with a vague
uncertainty of their possibilities which was far
worse than any definite fear

  a tapping came at the door and i heard the
glutinous accents of mling speaking i pocketed
one of the revolvers keeping one hand upon it
and opened to him

  good-morning sair he said bringing in in
addition to the customary herb-breakfast an ill-
cooked rabbit montgomery followed him his
roving eye caught the position of my arm and he
smiled askew

  the puma was resting to heal that day but
moreau who was singularly solitary in his habits
did not join us i talked with montgomery to clear
my ideas of the way in which the beast folk
the island of dr moreau

lived in particular i was urgent to know how
these inhuman monsters were kept from falling up-
on moreau and montgomery and from rending ono
another he explained to me that the comparative
safety of moreau and himself was due to the limited
mental scope of these monsters in spite of their
increased intelligence and the tendency of their
animal instincts to reawaken they had certain
fixed ideas implanted by moreau in their minds
which absolutely bounded their imaginations they
were really hypnotised had been told that certain
things were impossible and that certain things
were not to be done and these prohibitions were
woven into the texture of their minds beyond any
possibility of disobedience or dispute

  certain matters however in which old instinct
was at war with moreaus convenience were in a
less stable condition a series of propositions called
the law i had already heard them recited battled
in their minds with the deep-seated ever-rebellious
cravings of their animal natures this law they
were ever repeating i found and ever breaking
both montgomery and moreau displayed particular
solicitude to keep them ignorant of the taste of
blood they feared the inevitable suggestions of
that flavour montgomery told me that the law
especially among the feline beast people became
oddly weakened about nightfall that then the ani-
mal was at its strongest that a spirit of adventure
sprang up in them at the dusk when they would
dare things they never seemed to dream about by
day to that i owed my stalking by the leopard-
man on the night of my arrival but during these
earlier days of my stay they broke the law only
furtively and after dark in the daylight there was
a general atmosphere of respect for its multifarious
prohibitions

  and here perhaps i may give a few general facts
about the island and the beast people the island
which was of irregular outline and lay low upon the
wide sea had a total area i suppose of seven or
eight square miles it was volcanic in origin and
was now fringed on three sides by coral reefs some
fumaroles to the northward and a hot spring
were the only vestiges of the forces that had long
since originated it now and then a faint quiver
of earthquake would be sensible and sometimes the
ascent of the spire of smoke would be rendered
tumultuous by gusts of steam but that was all
the population of the island montgomery informed
me now numbered rather more than sixty of these
strange creations of moreaus art not counting
the smaller monstrosities which lived in the under-
growth and were without human form altogether
he had made nearly a hundred and twenty but
many had died and others-like the writhing
footless thing of which he had told me-had come
by violent ends in answer to my question mont-
gomery said that they actually bore offspring but
that these generally died when they lived moreau
took them and stamped the human form upon
them there was no evidence of the inheritance of
their acquired human characteristics the females
were less numerous than the males and liable to
much furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy
the law enjoined

  it would be impossible for me to describe these

   this description corresponds in every respect to nobles isle-

beast people in detail my eye has had no training
in details and unhappily i cannot sketch most
striking perhaps in their general appearance was
the disproportion between the legs of these crea-
tures and the length of their bodies and yet-
so relative is our idea of grace-my eye became
habituated to their forms and at last i even fell
in with their persuasion that my own long thighs
were ungainly another point was the forward
carriage of the head and the clumsy and inhuman
curvature of the spine even the ape-man lacked
that inward sinuous curve of the back which makes
the human figure so graceful most had their
shoulders hunched clumsily and their short fore-
arms hung weakly at their sides few of them
were conspicuously hairy at least until the end
of my time upon the island

  the next most obvious deformity was in their
faces almost all of which were prognathous mal-
formed about the ears with large and protuberant
noses very furry or very bristly hair and often
strangely-coloured or strangely-placed eyes none
could laugh though the ape-man had a chattering
titter beyond these general characters their heads
had little in common each preserved the quality of
its particular species the human mark distorted
but did not hide the leopard the ox or the sow or
other animal or animals from which the creature
had been moulded the voices too varied exceed-
ingly the hands were always malformed and
though some surprised me by their unexpected
human appearance almost all were deficient in the
number of the digits clumsy about the finger-nails
and lacking any tactile sensibility

  the two most formidable animal men were my
leopard-man and a creature made of hyena and
swine larger than these were the three bull-
creatures who rowed in the boat then came the
silvery-hairy-man who was also the sayer of the
law mling and a satyr-like creature of ape and
goat there were three swine-men and a swine-
woman a mare-rhinoceros-creature and several
other females whose sources i did not ascertain
there were several wolf-creatures a bear-bull and
a saint-bernard-man i have already described
the ape-man and there was a particularly hateful
and evil-smelling old woman made of vixen and
bear whom i hated from the beginning she was
said to be a passionate votary of the law smaller
creatures were certain dappled youths and my little
sloth-creature but enough of this catalogue

  at first i had a shivering horror of the brutes
felt all too keenly that they were still brutes but
insensibly i became a little habituated to the idea
of them and moreover i was affected by mont-
gomerys attitude towards them he had been
with them so long that he had come to regard them
as almost normal human beings his london days
seemed a glorious impossible past to him only
once in a year  so did he go to africa to deal with
moreaus agent a trader in animals there he
hardly met the finest type of mankind in that sea-
faring village of spanish mongrels the men
aboard-ship he told me seemed at first as strange
to him as the beast men seemed to me-unnaturally
long in the leg fiat in the face prominent in the
forehead suspicious dangerous and coldhearted


amazing stories

in fact he did not like men his heart had warmed
to me he thought because he had saved my life

i fancied even then that he had a sneaking kindness
for some of these metamorphosed brutes a vicious
sympathy with some of their ways but that he at-
tempted to veil it from me at first

  mling the black-face man montgomerys at-
tendant the first of the beast folk i had encount-
ered did not live with the others across the island
but in a small kennel at the back of the enclosure
the creature was scarcely so intelligent as the ape-
man but far more docile and the most human-
looking of all the beast folk and montgomery had
trained it to prepare food and indeed to discharge
all the trivial domestic offices that were required

it was a complex trophy of moreaus horrible skill v
-a bear tainted with dog and ox and one of the
most elaborately made of all his creatures it treat-
ed montgomery with a strange tenderness and de-
votion sometimes he would notice it pat it call
it half-mocking half-jocular names and so make it
caper with extraordinary delight sometimes hewould
ill-treat it especially after he had been at the
whisky kicking it beating it pelting it with stones
or lighted fusees but whether he treated it well or
ill it loved nothing so much as to be near him

  i say i became habituated to the beast people
that a thousand things which had seemed unnatural
and repulsive speedily became natural and ordinary
to me i suppose everything in existence takes its
colour from the average hue of its surroundings
montgomery and moreau were too peculiar and in-
dividual to keep my general impressions of human-
ity well defined i would see one of the clumsy
bovine-creatures who worked the launch treading
heavily through the undergrowth and find myself
asking trying hard to recall how he differed from
some really human yokel trudging home from his
mechanical labours or i would meet the fox-bear
womans vulpine shifty face strangely human in
its speculative cunning and even imagine i had
met it before in some city byway

  yet every now and then the beast would flash
out upon me beyond doubt or denial an ugly-
looking man a hunch-baclced human savage to all ap-v
pearance squatting in the aperture of one of the
dens would stretch his arms and yawn showing with
startling suddenness scissor-edged incisors anc
sabre-like canines keen and brilliant as knives or
in some narrow pathway glancing with a transitory
daring into the eyes of some lithe white-swathed
female figure i would suddenly see with a spasmo-
dic revulsion that she had slit-like pupils or glanc-
ing down iote the curving nail with which she held
her shapeless wrap about her it is a curious thing
by the bye for which i am quite unable to account
that these weird creatures-the females i mean-
had in the earlier days of my stay an instinctive
sense of their own repulsive clumsiness and dis-
played in consequence a more than human regard
for the decency and decorum of extensive costume

chapter xvi

how the beast folk taste blood

y inexperience as a writer betrays mg and
i wander from the thread of my story
after i had breakfasted with mont-

gomery he took me across the island to see the
fumarole and the source of the hot spring into
whose scalding waters i had blundered on the pre-
vious day both of us carried whips and loaded
revolvers while going through a leafy jungle on
our road thither we heard a rabbit squealing we
stopped and listened but we heard no more and
presently we went on our way and the incident
dropped out of our minds montgomery called
my attention to certain little pink animals
with long hind-legs that went leaping through
the undergrowth he told me they were creatures
made of the offspring of the beast people that mor-
eau had invented he had fancied they might serve
for meat but a rabbit-like habit of devouring their
young had defeated this intention i had already
encountered some of these creatures-once during
my moonlight flight from the leopard-man and once
during my pursuit by moreau on the previous day
by chance one hopping to avoid us leapt into the
hole caused by the uprooting of a wind-blown tree
before it could extricate itself we managed to catch
it it spat like a cat scratched and kicked vigor-
ously with its hind-legs and made an attempt to
bite but its teeth were too feeble to inflict more
than a painless pinch it seemed to me rather a
pretty little creature and as montgomery stated
that it never destroyed the turf by burrowing and
was very cleanly in its habits i should imagine it
might prove a convenient substitute for the com-
mon rabbit in gentlemens parks

   we also saw on our way the trunk of a tree
 barked in long strips and splintered deeply mont-
 gomery called my attentions to this not to claw
 bark of trees that is the law he said much
 some of them care for it it was after this i
 think that we met the satyr and the ape-man
 the satyr was a gleam of classical memory on the
 part of moreau-his face bovine in expression like
 the coaser hebrew type his voice a harsh bleat
 his nether extremities satanic he was gnawing
 the husk of a pod-like fruit as he passed us both
 of them saluted montgomery

   hail said they to the other with the whip
 theres a third with a whip now said mont-
 gomery so youd better mind

   was he not made said the ape-man he said
 -he said he was made

   tho satyr-man looked curiously at me the
 third with the whip he that walks weeping into
 the sea has a thin white face
 f he has a thin long whip said montgomery
 f yesterday he bled and wept said the satyr
 you never bleed nor weep the master does not
 bleed or weep

   ollendorffian beggar said montgomery youll
 bleed and weep if you dont look out

   he has five fingers he is a five-man like me
 said the ape-man

   come along prendick said montgomery tak-
 ing my arm and i went on with him

   the satyr and the ape-man stood watching us
 and making other remarks to each other

   he says nothing said the satyr men have
 voices

   yesterday he asked me of things to eat said
 the ape-man he did not know
the island of dr moreau



  then they spoke inaudible things and i heard
the satyr laughing

  it was on our way back that we came upon the
dead rabbit the red body of the wretched little
beast was rent to pieces many of the ribs stripped
white and the backbone indisputably gnawed

  at that montgomery stopped good god said
he stooping down and picking up some of the
crushed vertebras to examine them more closed
good god he repeated what can this mean
some carnivore of yours has remembered its
old habits i said after a pause this backbone
has been bitten through

  he stood staring with his face white and his
lip pulled askew i dont like this he said slowly

  i saw something of the same kind said i
the first day i came here

  the devil you did what was it

  a rabbit with its head twisted off

  the day you came here

  the day i came here in the undergrowth at
the back of the enclosure when i went out in the
evening the head was completely wrung off
he gave a long low whistle

  and what is more i have an idea which of
your brutes did the thing its only a suspicion
you know before i came on the rabbit i saw one
of your monsters drinking in the stream
sucking his drink

  yes

   not to suck your drink that is the law much
the brutes care for the law eh when moreaus not
about

  it was the brute who chased me

  of course said montgomery its just the
way with carnivores after a kill they drink its
the taste of blood you know-what was the brute
like  he continued would you know him again 
he glanced about us standing astride over the mess
of dead rabbit his eyes roving among the shadows
and screens of greenery the lurking-places and
ambuscades of the forest that bounded us in the
taste of blood he said again

  he took out his revolver examined the cart-
ridges in it and replaced it then he began to
pull at his dropping lip

  i think i should know the brute again i said
i stunned him he ought to have a handsome
bruise on the forehead of him

  but then we have to prove that he killed the
rabbit said montgomery i wish id never
brought the things here

  i should have gone on but he stayed there think-
ing over the mangled rabbit in a puzzle-headed way
as it was i went to such a distance that the rab-
bits remains were hidden

  come on i said

  presently he woke up and came towards me
you see he said almost in a whisper they are
all supposed to have a fixed idea against eating
anything that runs on land if some brute has by
any accident tasted blood-he went on some way
in silence i wonder what can have happened
he said to himself then after a pause again i
did a foolish thing the other day that servant
of mine-i showed him how to skin and cook a
rabbit its odd-i saw him licking his hands-

it never occurred to me then we must put ai
stop to this i must tell moreau

  he could think of nothing else on our homeward
journey

  moreau took the matter even more seriously than
montgomery and i need scarcely say that i was
affected by their evident consternation

  we must make an example said moreau ive
no doubt in my own mind that the leopard-man
was the sinner but how can we prove it i wish
montgomery you had kept your taste for meat in
hand and gone without these exciting novelties
we may find ourselves in a mess yet through it
i was a silly ass said montgomery but the
things done now and you said i might have them
you know-

  we must see to the thing at once said moreau
i suppose if anything should turn up mling can
take care of himself

  im not so sure of mling said montgomery
i thing i ought to know him

  in the afternoon moreau montgomery myself
and mling went across the island to the huts in
the ravine we three were armed mling carried
the little hatchet he used in chopping firewood and
some coils of wire moreau had a huge cowherds
horn slung over his shoulder

  you will see a gathering of the beast people
said montgomery it is a pretty sight

  moreau said not a word on the way but the ex-
pression of his heavy white-fringed face was grim-
ly set

  we crossed the ravine down which smoked the
stream of hot water and followed the winding path-
way through the canebrakes until we reached a wide
area covered over with a thick powdery yellow sub-
stance which i believe was sulphur above the
shoulder of a weedy bank the sea glittered we
came to a kind of shallow natural amphitheatre and
here the four of us halted then moreau sounded
the horn and broke the sleeping stillness of the
tropical afternoom he must have had strong lungs
the hooting note rose and rose amidst its echoes
to at last an ear-penetrating intensity

  ah said moreau letting the curved instrument
fall to his side again

  immediately there was a crashing through the
yellow canes and a sound of voices from the dense
green jungle that marked the morass through
which i had run on the previous day then at three
or four points on the edge of the sulphurous area
appeared the grotesque forms of the beast people
hurrying towards us i could not help a creeping
horror as i perceived first one and then another trot
out from the trees or reeds and come shambling
along over the hot dust but moreau and mont-
gomery stood calmly enough and perforce i stuck
beside them

  first to arrive was the satyr strangely unreal
for all that he cast a shadow and tossed the dust
with his hoofs after him from the brake came
a monstrous lout a thing of horse and rhinoceros
chewing a straw as it came then appeared the
swine-woman and two wolf-women then the fox-
bear witch with her red eyes in her peaked red
face and then others-all hurrying eagerly as
they came forward they began to cringe towards


amazing stories

 moreau and chant quite regardless of one another
 fragments of the latter half of the litany of the
 law-ilis is the hand that wounds his is the
 hand that heals and so forth as soon as they had
 approached within a distance of perhaps thirty
 yards they halted and bowing on knees and elbows
 began flinging the white dust upon their heads

  imagine the scene if you can we three blue-
 clad men with our misshapen black-faced attendant
 standing in a wide expanse of sunlit yellow dust
 under the blazing blue sky and surrounded by this
 circle of crouching and gesticulating monstrosities
 -some almost human save in their subtle expres-
 sion and gestures some like cripples some so
 strangely distorted as to resemble nothing but the
 denizens of our wildest dreams and beyond the
 reedy lines of a canebrake in one direction a dense
 tangle of palm-trees on the other separating us
 from the ravine with the huts and to the north the
 hazy horizon of the pacific ocean

   sixty-two sixty-three counted moreau there
 are four more

   i do not see the leopard-man said i

   presently moreau sounded the great horn again
 and at the sound of it all the beast people writhed
 and grovelled in the dust then slinking out of
 the canebrake stooping near the ground and trying
 to join the dust-throwing circle behind moreaus
 back came the leopard-man the last of the beast
 people to arrive was the little ape-man the earlier
 animals hot and weary with their grovelling shot
 vicious glances at him

   cease said moreau in his firm loud voice and
 the beast people sat back upon their hams and
 rested from their worshipping

   where is the sayer of the law said moreau
 and the hairy-grey monster bowed his face in the
 dust

   say the words said moreau

   forthwith all in the kneeling assembly swaying
 from side to side and dashing up the sulphur with
 their hands-first the right hand and a puff of
 dust and then the left-began once more to chant
 their strange litany when they reached not to
 eat flesh or fowl that is the law moreau held
 up his lank white hand

   stop he cried and there fell absolute silence
 upon them all

  i think they all knew and dreaded what was
 coming i looked round at their strange faces
 when i saw their wincing attitudes and the furtive
 dread in their bright eyes i wondered that i had
 ever believed them to be men

   that law has been broken said moreau

 i none escape from the faceless creature with
 the silvery hair none escape repeated the kneel-
 ing circle of beast people

   who is he cried moreau and looked round at
 their faces cracking his whip i fancied the hyena-
 swine looked dejected so too did the leopard-man
 moreau stopped facing this creature who cringed
 towards him with the memory and dread of infinite
 torment who is he repeated moreau in a voice
 of thunder

  evil is he who breaks the law chanted the
 sayer of the law

   moreau looked into the eyes of the leopard-man

 and seemed to be dragging the very soul out of the
 creature

  who breaks the law- said moreau taking
his eyes off his victim and turning toward us it
seemed to me there was a touch of exultation in his
voice

   goes back to the house of pain they all clam-
oured-goes back to the house of pain  mas-
ter

  back to the house of pain-back to the house
of pain gabbled the ape-man as though the idea
was sweet to him

  do you hear said moreau turning back to
the criminal my friend-hullo

  for the leopard-man released from moreaus
eye had risen straight from his knees and now
with eyes aflame and his huge feline tusks flashing
out from under his curling lips leapt towards his
tormentor i am convinced that only the madness
of unendurable fear could have prompted this at-
tack the whole circle of threescore monsters
seemed to rise about us i drew my revolver the
two figures collided i saw moreau reeling back
from the leopard-mans blow there was a furious
yelling and howling all about us every one was
moving rapidly for a moment i thought it was a
general revolt the furious face of the leopard-
man flashed by mine with mling close in pursuit
i saw the yellow eyes of the hyena-swine blazing
with excitement his attitude as if he were half re-
solved to attack me the satyr too glared at me
over the hyena-swines hunched shoulders i heard
the crack of moreaus pistol and saw the pink flash
dart across the tumult the whole crowd seemed
to swing round in the direction of the glint of fire
and i too was swung round by the magnetism of
the movement in another second i was running
one of a tumultuous shouting crowd in pursuit of
the escaping leopard-man

   that is all i can tell definitely i saw the leo-
pard-man strike moreau and then everything spun
about me until i was running headlong mling
was ahead close in pursuit of the fugitive behind
their tongues already lolling out ran the wolf-
women in great leaping strides the swine folk
followed squealing with excitement and the two
bull-men in their swathings of white then came
moreau in a cluster of the beast people his wide-
brimmed straw hat blown off his revolver in hand
and his lank white hair streaming out the hyena-
swine ran beside me keeping pace with me and
glancing furtively at me out of his canine eyes
and the others came pattering and shouting behind
us

  the leopard-man went bursting his way through
the long canes which sprang back as he passed
and rattled in mlings face we others in the rear
found a trampled path for us when we reached the
brake the chase lay through the brake for per-
haps a quarter of a mile and then plunged into a
dense thicket which retarded our movements ex-
ceedingly though we went through it in a crowd
together-fronds flicking into our faces ropy
creepers catching us under the chin or gripping our
ankles thorny plants hooking into and tearing cloth
and flesh together
the island of dr moreau

  he has gone on all-fours through this panted
moreau now just ahead of me

  none escape said the wolf-bear laughing into
my face with the exultation of hunting

  we burst out again among rocks and saw the
quarry ahead running lightly on all-fours and snarl-
ing at us over his shoulder at that the wolf folk
howled with delight the thing was still clothed
and at a distance its face still seemed human but
the carriage of its four limbs was feline and the
furtive droop of its shoulder was distinctly that of
a hunted animal it leapt over some thorny yellow-
flowering bushes and was hidden mling was half-
way across the space

  most of us now had lost the first speed of the
chase and had fallen into a longer and steadier
stride i saw as we traversed the open that the
pursuit was now spreading from a column into a
line the ilyena-swine still ran close to me watch-
ing me as it ran every now and then puckering its
muzzle with a snarling laugh at the edge of the
rocks the leopard-man realising that he was mak-
ing for the projecting cape upon which he had
stalked me on the night of my arrival had doubled
in the undergrowth but montgomery had seen the
manceuvre and turned him again so panting
tumbling against rocks torn by brambles impeded
by ferns and reeds i helped to pursue the leopard-
man who had broken the law and the hyena-swine
ran laughing savagely by my side i staggered on
my head reeling and my heart beating against my
ribs tired almost to death and yet not daring to
lose sight of the chase lest i should be left alone
with this horrible companion i staggered on in
spite of infinite fatigue and the dense heat of the
tropical afternoon

  at last the fury of the hunt slackened we had
pinned the wretched brute into a corner of the
island moreau whip in hand marshalled us all
into an irregular line and we advanced now slowly
shouting to one another as we advanced and tight-
ening the cordon about our victim he lurked
noiseless and invisible in the bushes through which
i had run from him during that midnight pursuit

  steady cried moreau steady as the ends
of the line crept round the tangle of undergrowth
and hemmed the brute in

  ware a rush came the voice of montgomery
from beyond the thicket

  i was on the slope above the bushes montgomery
and moreau beat along the beach beneath slowly
we pushed in among the fretted network of branches
and leaves the quarry was silent

  back to the house of pain the house of pain
the house of pain yelped the voice of the ape-
man some twenty yards to the right

  when i heard that i forgave the poor wretch all
the fear he had inspired in me i heard the twigs
snap and the boughs swish aside before the heavy
tread of the horse-rhinoceros upon my right then
suddenly through a polygon of green in the half
darkness under the luxuriant growth i saw the
creature we were hunting i halted he was
crouched together into the smallest possible com-
pass his luminous green eyes turned over his
shoulder regarding me

  it may seem a strange contradiction in me-i

cannot explain the fact-but now seeing the crea-
ture there in a perfectly animal attitude with the
light gleaming in its eyes and its imperfectly human
face distorted with terror i realised again the fact
of its humanity in another moment other of its
pursuers would see it and it would be overpowered
and captured to experience once more the horrible
tortures of the enclosure abruptly i slipped out
my revolver aimed between its terror-struck eyes
and fired as i did so the hyena-swine saw tho
thing and flung itself upon it with an eager cry
thrusting thirsty teeth into its neck all about me
the green masses of the thicket were swaying and
cracking as the beast people came rushing to-
gether one face and then another appeared

  dont kill it prendick cried moreau dont
kill it and i saw him stooping as he pushed
through under the fronds of the big ferns

  in another moment he had beaten off the hyena-
swine with the handle of his whip and he and
montgomery were keeping away the excited carni-
vorous beast people and particularly mling from
the still quivering body the hairy-grey thing
came sniffing at the corpse under my arms tho
other animals in their animal ardour jostled me to
get a nearer view

  confound you prendick said moreau i
wanted him

  im sorry said i though i was not it was
the impulse of the moment i felt sick with exer-
tion and excitement turning i pushed my way out
of the crowding beast people and went on alone up
the slope towards the higher part of the headland
under the shouted directions of moreau i heard the
three white-swathed bull-men begin dragging the
victim down towards the water

  it was easy now for me to be alone the beast
people manifested a quite human curiosity about
the dead body and followed it in a thick knot sniff-
ing and growling at it as the bull-men dragged it
down the beach i went to the headland and watch-
ed the bull-men black against the evening sky as
they carried the weighted dead body out to sea and
like a wave across my mind came the realisation of
the unspeakable aimlessness of things upon the is-
land upon the beach among the rocks beneath me
were the ape-man the hyena-swine and several
other of the beast people standing about mont-
gomery and moreau they were all still intensely
excited and all overflowing with noisy expressions
of their loyalty to the law yet i felt an absolute
assurance in my own mind that the hyena-swine
was implicated in the rabbit-killing a strange per-
suasion came upon me that save for the grossness
of the line the grotesqueness of the forms i had
here before me the whole balance of human life in
miniature the whole interplay of instinct reason
and fate in its simplest form the leopard-man had
happened to go under that was all the difference
poor brute

  poor brutes i began to see the viler aspect of
moreaus cruelty i had not thought before of the
pain and trouble that came to these poor victims
after they had passed from moreaus hands i had
shivered only at the days of actual torment in the
enclosure but now that seemed to me the lesser
part before they had been beasts their instincts


amazing stories

fitly adapted to their surroundings and happy as
living things may he now they stumbled in the
shackles of humanity lived in a fear that never
died fretted by a law they could not understand
their mock-human existence begun in an agony
was one long internal struggle one long dread of
moreau-and for what it was the wantonness of
it that stirred me

  had moreau had any intelligible object i could
have sympathised at least a little with him i am
not so squeamish about pain as that i could have
forgiven him a little even had his motive been only
hate but he was so irresponsible so utterly care-
less  his curiosity his mad aimless investigations
drove him on and the things were thrown out to
live a year or so to struggle and blunder and suffer
and at last to die painfully they were wretched
in themselves the old animal hate moved them to
trouble one another the law held them back from
a brief hot struggle and a decisive end to their
natural animosities

  in those days my fear of the beast people went
the way of my personal fear for moreau i fell in-
deed into a morbid state deep and enduring and
alien to fear which has left permanent scars upon
my mind i must confess that i lost faith in the
sanity of the world when i saw it suffering the pain-
ful disorder of this island a blind fate a vast
pitiless mechanism seemed to cut and shape the
fabric of existence and i moreau by his passion
for research montgomery by his passion for
drink the beast people with their instincts and
mental restrictions were torn and crushed ruth-
lessly inevitably amid the infinite complexity of
its incessant wheels but this condition did not
come all at once i think indeed that i anticipate a
little in speaking of it now

            chapter xvii
            a catastrophe

scarcely six weeks passed before i had lost
every feeling but dislike and abhorrence for
this infamous experiment of moreaus my
one idea was to get away from these horrible cari-
catures of my makers image back to the sweet and
wholesome intercourse of men my fellow-crea-
tures from whom i was thus separated began to
assume idyllic virtue and beauty in my memory
my first friendship with montgomery did not in-
crease his long separation from humanity his
secret vice of drunkenness his evident sympathy
with thevbeast people tainted him to me several
times i let him go alone among them i avoided
intercourse with them in every possible way i
spent an increasing proportion of my time upon the
beach looking for some liberating sail that never
appeared-until one day there fell upon us an ap-
palling disaster which put an altogether different
aspect upon my strange surroundings

  it was about seven or eight weeks after my land-
ing-rather more i think though i had not
troubled to keep account of the time-when this
catastrophe occurred it happened in the early
morning-i should think about six i had risen and
breakfasted early having been aroused by the noise

of three beast men carrying wood into the en-
closure

  after breakfast i went to the open gateway of
the enclosure and stood there smoking a cigarette
and enjoying the freshness of the early morning
moreau presently came round the corner of the
enclosure and greeted me he passed by me and
i heard him behind me unlock and enter his labora-
tory so indurated was i at that time to the
abomination of the place that i heard without a
touch of emotion the puma victim begin another day
of torture it met its persecutor with a shriek al-
most exactly like that of an angry virago

  then suddenly something happened-i do not
know what to this day i heard a short sharp cry
behind me a fall and turning saw an awful face
rushing upon me-not human not animal but
hellish brown seamed with red branching scars
red drops starting out upon it and the lidless eyes
ablaze i threw up my arm to defend myself from
the blow that flung me headlong with a broken fore-
arm and the great monster swathed in lint and
with red-stained bandages fluttering about it leapt
over me and passed i rolled over and over down
the beach tried to sit up and collapsed upon my
broken arm then moreau appeared his massive
white face all the more terrible for the blood that
trickled from his forehead he carried a revolver
in one hand he scarcely glanced at me but rushed
off at once in pursuit of the-puma

  i tried the other arm and sat up the muffled
figure in front ran in great striding leaps along the
beach and moreau followed her she turned her
head and saw him then doubling abruptly made for
the bushes she gained upon him at every stride
i saw her plunge into them and moreau running
slantingly to intercept her fired and missed as she
disappeared then he too vanished in the green
confusion

  i stared after them and then the pain in my
arm flamed up and with a groan i staggered to my
feet montgomery appeared in the doorway dressed
and with his revolver in his hand

  great god prendick he said not noticing
that i was hurt that brutes loose tore the
fetter out of the wall have you seen him
then sharply seeing i gripped my arm whats
the matter

  i was standing in the doorway said i

  he came forward and took my arm blood on
the sleeve said he and rolled back the flannel he
pocketed his weapon felt my arm about painfully
and led me inside your arm is broken he said
and then tell me exactly how it happened-what
happened

  i told him what i had seen told him in broken
sentences with gasps of pain between them and
very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm
meanwhile he slung it from my shoulder stood
back and looked at me

  youll do he said and now

  he thought then he went out and locked the
gates of the enclosure he was absent some time

  i was chiefly concerned about my arm the in
cident seemed merely one more of many horrible
things i sat down in the deck chair and i must
admit swore heartily at the island the first dull
feeling of injury in my arm had already given way
the island of dr moreau



to a burning pain when montgomery reappeared
his face was rather pale and he showed more of
his lower gums than ever

  i can neither see nor hear anything of him he
said ive been thinking he may want my help
he stared at me with his expressionless eyes that
was a strong brute he said it simply wrenched
its fetter out of the wall he went to the window
then to the door and there turned to me i shall
go after him he said theres another revolver
i can leave with you to tell you the truth i feel
anxious somehow

  he obtained the weapon and put it ready to my
hand on the table then went out leaving a restless
contagion in the air i did not sit long after he
left but took the revolver in hand and went to the
doorway

  the morning was as still as death not a whisper
of wind was stirring the sea was like polished
glass the sky empty the beach desolate in my
half-excited half-feverish state this stillness of
things oppressed me i tried to whistle and the
tune died away i swore again-the second time
that morning then i went to the corner of the
enclosure and stared inland at the green bush that
had swallowed up moreau and montgomery when
would they return and how then far away up the
beach a little grey beast man appeared ran down
to the waters edge and began splashing about i
strolled back to the doorway then to the corner
again and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel
upon duty once i was arrested by the distant
voice of montgomery bawling coo-ee- mor-eau
my arm became less painful but very hot i got
feverish and thirsty my shadow grew shorter
i watched the distant figure until it went away
again would moreau and montgomery never re-
turn three sea-birds began fighting for some
stranded treasure

  then from far away behind the enclosure i heard
a pistol-shot a long silence and then came an-
other then a yelling cry nearer and another dis-
mal gap of silence my unfortunate imagination set
to work to torment me then suddenly a shot close
by i went to the corner startled and saw mont-
gomery-his face scarlet his hair disordered and
the knee of his trousers torn his face expressed
profound consternation behind him slouched the
beast man mling and round mlings jaws were
some queer dark stains

  has he come said montgomery

  moreau said i no

  my god the man was panting almost sobbing
go back in he said taking my arm theyre
mad theyre all rushing about mad what can
have happened i dont know ill tell you when
my breath comes wheres some brandy

  montgomery limped before me into the room and
sat down in the deck chair mling flung himself
down just outside the doorway and began panting
like a dog i got montgomery some brandy-and-
water he sat staring in front of him at nothing
recovering his breath after some minutes he be-
gan to tell me what had happened

  he had followed their track for some way it
was plain enough at first on account of the crushed
and broken bushes white rags torn from the pumas

bandages and occasional smears of blood on the
leaves of the shrubs and undergrowth he lost
the track however on the stony ground beyond tho
stream where i had seen the beast man drinking
and went wandering aimlessly westward shouting
moreaus name then mling had come to him
carrying a light hatchet mling had seen nothing
of the puma affair had been felling wood and
heard him calling they went on shouting together
two beast men came crouching and peering at them
through the undergrowth with gestures and a fur-
tive carriage that alarmed montgomery by their
strangeness he hailed them and they fled guiltily
he stopped shouting after that and after wander-
ing some time farther in an undecided way deter-
mined to visit the huts

  he found the ravine deserted

  growing more alarmed every minute he began
to retrace his steps then it was he encountered
the two swine-rmen i had seen dancing on the night
of my arrival bloodstained they were about the
mouth and intensely excited they came crashing
through the ferns and stopped with fierce faces
when they saw him he cracked his whip in some
trepidation and forthwith they rushed at him
never before had a beast man dared to do that
one he shot through the head mling flung himself
upon the other and the two rolled grappling mling
got his brute under and with his teeth in its throat
and montgomery shot that too as it struggled in
mlings grip he had some difficulty in inducing
mling to come on with him thence they had hur-
ried back to me on the way mling had suddenly
rushed into a thicket and driven out an undersized
jackal-man also blood-stained and lame through
a wound in the foot this brute had run a little
way and then turned savgely at bay and mont-
gomery-with a certain wantonness i thought-
had shot him

  what does it all mean said i

  he shook his head and turned once more to the
brandy

chapter xviii
the finding of moreau

when i saw montgomery swallow a third
dose of brandy i took it upon myself to
interfere he was already more than half
fuddled i told him that some serious thing must
have happened to moreau by this time or he would
have returned before this and that it behooved us to
ascertain what that catastrophe was montgomery
raised some feeble objections and at last agreed
we had some food and then all three of us started

  it is possibly due to the tension of my mind at
the time but even now that start into the hot still-
ness of the tropical afternoon is a singularly vivid
impression mling went first his shoulder hunched
his strange black head moving with quick starts as
he peered first on this side of the way and then on
that he was unarmed his axe he had dropped
when he encountered the swine-man teeth were
his weapons when it came to fighting montgomery
followed with stumbling footsteps his hands in his
pockets his face downcast he was in a state of
muddled sullenness with me on account of the


amazing stories

brandy my left arm was in a sling it was lucky
it was my left and i carried my revolver in my
right soon we traced a narrow path through the
wild luxuriance of the island going northwestward
and presently mling stopped and became rigid
with watchfulness montgomery almost staggered
into him and then stopped too then listening in-
tently we heard coming through the trees the sound
of voices and footsteps approaching us

  he is dead said a deep vibrating voice

  he is not dead he is not dead jabbered an-
other

  we saw we saw said several voices

  hvjao suddenly shouted montgomery ilul-lo
there

  confound you said i and gripped my pistol

  there was a silence then a crashing among the
interlacing vegetation first here then there and
then half-a-dozen faces appeared-strange faces lit
by a strange light mling made a growling noise
in his throat i recognised the ape-man i had
indeed already identified his voice and two of the
white-swathed brown-featured creatures i had seen
in montgomerys boat with these were the two
dappled brutes and that grey horribly crooked crea-
ture who said the law with grey hair streaming
down its cheeks heavy grey eyebrows and grey
locks pouring off from a central parting upon its
sloping forehead-a heavy faceless thing with
strange red eyes looking at us curiously from
amidst the green

  for a space no one spoke then montgomery
hiccoughed who-said he was dead

  the monkey-man looked guiltily at the hair-grey
thing he is dead said this monster they
saw

  there was nothing threatening about this detach-
ment at any rate they seemed awe-stricken and
puzzled

  where is he said montgomery

  beyond and the grey creature pointed

  is there a law now asked the monkey-mari
is it still to be this and that is he dead indeed

  is there a law repeated the man in white
is there a law thou other with the whip

  he is dead said the hairy-grey thing

  and they all stood watching us

  prendick said montgomery turning his dull
eyes to me hes dead evidently

  i had been standing behind him during this
colloquy i began to see how things lay with them
i suddenly stopped in front of montgomery and
lifted up my voice-

  children of the law i said he is not dead
mling turned his sharp eyes on me he has
changed his shape he has changed his body i
went on for a time you will not see him he
is-there i pointed upward where he can watch
you you cannot see him but he can see you fear
the law

  i looked at them squarely they flinched

  he is great he is good said the ape-man
peering fearfully upward among the dense trees

  and the other thing i demanded

  the thing that bled and ran screaming and
sobbing-that is dead too said the grey thing
still regarding me

  thats well grunted montgomery

  the other with the whip- began the grey
thing

  well said i

  said he was dead

  but montgomery was still sober enough to under-
stand my motive in denying moreaus death he
is not dead he said slowly not dead at all no
more dead than i am	i

  some said i have broken the law they will
die some have died show us now where his old
body lies-the body he cast away because he had no
more need of it

  it is this way man who walked in the sea
said the grey thing

  and with these six creatures guiding us we went
through the tumult of ferns and creepers and tree-
stems towards the northwest then came a yelling
a crashing among the branches and a little pink
homunculus rushed by us shrieking immediately
after appeared a feral monster in headlong pursuit
blood-bedabbled who was amongst us almost before
he could stop his career the grey thing leapt
aside mling with a snarl flew at it and was
struck aside montgomery fired and missed bowed
his head threw up his arm and turned to run i
fired and the thing still came on fired again point-
blank into its ugly face i saw its features vanish
in a flash its face was driven in yet it passed me
gripped montgomery and holding him fell head-
long beside him and pulled him sprawling upon it-
self in its death-agony

  i found myself alone with mling the dead brute
and-the prostrate man montgomery raised himself
slowly and stared in a muddled way at the shattered
beast man beside him it more than half sobered
him he scrambled to his feet then i saw the
grey thing returning cautiously through the trees

  see said i pointing to the dead brute is the
law not alive  this came of breaking the law

  he peered at the body he sends the fire that
kills said he in his deep voice repeating part of
the ritual the others gathered round and stared
for a space

  at last we drew near the westward extremity of
the island we came upon the gnawed and mutilated
body of the puma its shoulder-bone smashed by a
bullet and perhaps twenty yards farther found at
last what we sought moreau lay face downward in
a trampled space in a canebrake one hand was
almost severed at the wrist and his silvery hair
was dabbled in blood his head had been battered
in by the fetters of the puma the broken canes
beneath him were smeared with blood his revolver
we could not find montgomery turned him over

  resting at intervals and with the help of the
seven beast people for he was a heavy man we
carried moreau back to the enclosure the night
was darkling twice we heard unseen creatures
howling and shrieking past our little band and
once the little pink sloth-creature appeared and
stared at us and vanished again but we were not
attacked again at the gates of the enclosure our
company of beast people left us mling going with
the rest we locked ourself in and then took
moreaus mangled body into the yard and laid it
upon a pile of brushwood then we went into the
the island of dr moreau



laboratory and put an end to all we found living
there

chapter xix
montgomerys bank holiday

when this was accomplished and we had
washed and eaten montgomery and i went
into my little room and seriously discussed
our position for the first time it was then near
midnight he was almost sober but greatly dis-
turbed in his mind he had been strangely under
the influence of moreaus personality i do not
think it had ever occurred to him that moreau could
die this disaster was the sudden collapse of the
habits that had become part of his nature in the ten
or more monotonous years he had spent on the is-
land he talked vaguely answered my questions
crookedly wandered into general questions

  this silly ass of a world he said what a
muddle it all is i havent had any life i wonder
when its going to begin sixteen years being bul-
lied by nurses and schoolmasters at their own
sweet will five in london grinding hard at med-
icine bad food shabby lodgings shabby clothes
shabby vice a blunder-i didnt know any better
-and hustled off to this beastly island ten years
here whats it all for prendick are we bubbles
blown by a baby

  it was hard to deal with such ravings the thing
we have to think of now said i is how to get
away from this island

  whats the good of getting away im an out-
cast where am i to join on its all very well
for you prendick poor old moreau we cant
leave him here to have his bones picked as it is-
and besides what will become of the decent part of
the beast folk

  well said i that willdo to-morrow ive been
thinking we might make that brush-wood into a
pyre and burn his body-and those other things
then what will happen with the beast folk

   dont know i suppose those that were made
of beasts of prey will make silly asses of them-
selves sooner or later we cant massacre the lot-
can we i suppose thats what your humanity
would suggest but theyll change they are sure
to change

  he talked thus inconclusively until at last i felt
my temper going

  damnation he exclaimed at some petulance of
mine cant you see im in a worse hole than you
are and he got up and went for the brandy
drink he said returning you logic-chopping
chalky-faced saint of an atheist drink

  not i said i and sat grimly watching his face
under the yellow paraffin flare as he drank himself
into a garrulous misery

  i have a memory of infinite tedium he wandered
into a maudlin defence of the beast people and of
mling mling he said was the only thing that had
ever really cared for him and suddenly an idea
came to him

  im damned said he staggering to his feet and
clutching the brandy bottle

by some flash of intuition i knew what it was he
intended you dont give drink to that beast i

said rising and facing him

  beast said he youre the beast he takes
his liquor like a christian come out of the way
prendick

  for gods sake said i

  get-out of the way he roared and suddenly
whipped out his revolver

  very well said i and stood aside half-minded
to fall upon him as he put his hand upon the latch
but deterred by the thought of my useless arm
youve made a beast of yourself-to the beasts
you may go

  he flung the doorway open and stood half facing
me between the yellow lamp-light and the pallid
glare of the moon his eye-sockets were blotches
of black under his stubbly eye-brows

  youre a solemn prig prendick a silly ass
youre always fearing and fancying were on the
edge of things im bound to cut my throat to-
morrow im going to have a damned bank holiday
to-night he turned and went out into the moon-
light mling he cried mling old friend

  three dim creatures in the silvery light came
along the edge of the wan beach-one a white-
wrapped creature the other two blotches of black-
ness following it they halted staring then i
saw mlings hunched shoulders as he came round
the corner of the house

  drink cried montgomery drink you brutes
drink and be men damme im the cleverest
moreau forgot this this is the last touch drink
i tell you and waving the bottle in his hand he
started off at a kind of quick trot to the westward
mling ranging himself between him and the three
dim creatures who followed

  i went to the doorway they were already in-
distinct in the mist of the moonlight before mont-
gomery halted i saw him administer a dose of
the raw brandy to mling and saw the five figures
melt into one vague patch

  sing i heard montgomery shout-sing all
together confound olds prendick thats right
now again confound old prendick

  the black group broke up into five separate fig-
ures and wound slowly away from me along the
band of shining beach each went howling at his
own sweet will yelping insults at me or giving
whatever other vent this new inspiration of brandy
demanded presently i heard montgomerys voice
shouting right turn and they passed with their
shouts and howls into the blackness of the landward
trees slowly very slowly they receded into silence

  the peaceful splendour of the night healed again
the moon was now past the meridian and travelling
down the west it was at its full and very bright
riding through the empty dark sky the shadow
of the wall lay a yard wide and of inky blackness
at my feet the eastward sea was a featureless
grey dark and mysterious and between the sea
and the shadow the grey sands of volcanic glass
and crystals flashed and shone like a beach of dia-
monds behind me the paraffin lamp flared hot
and ruddy

  then i shut the door locked it and went into
the enclosure where moreau lay beside his latest
victims-the staghounds and the llama and some
other wretched brutes-with his massive face calm


amazing stories

even after his terrible death and with the hard
eyes open staring at the dead white moon above
i sat down upon the edge of the sink and with
my eyes upon that ghastly pile of silvery light and
ominous shadows began to turn over my plans in
the morning i would gather some provisions in the
dingey and after setting fire to the pyre before me
push out into the desolation of the high sea once
more i felt that for montgomery there was no
help that he was in truth half akin to these
beast folk unfitted for human kindred

  i do not know how long i sat there scheming
it must have been an hour or so then my plan-
ning was interrupted by the return of montgomery
to my neighbourhood i heard a yelling from many
throats a tumult of exultant cries passing down
towards the beach whooping and howling and ex-
cited shrieks that seemed to come to a stop near
the waters edge the riot rose and fell i heard
heavy blows and the splintering smash of wood
but it did not trouble me then a discordant chant-
ing began

  my thoughts went back to my means of escape
i got up brought the lamp and went into a shed
to look at some kegs i had seen there then i
became interested in the contents of some biscuit-
tins and opened one i saw something out of the
tail of my eye-a red figure-and turned sharply

  behind me lay the yard vividly black-and-white
in the moonlight and the pile of wood and faggots
on which moreau and his mutilated victims lay
one over another they seemed to be gripping one
another in one last revengeful grapple his-wounds
gaped black as night and the blood that had drip-
ped lay in black patches upon the sand then i
saw without understanding the cause of my
phantom-a ruddy glow that came and danced and
went upon the wall opposite i misinterpreted this
fancied it was a reflection of my flickering lamp
and turned again to the stores in the shed i went
on rummaging among them as well as a one-armed
man could finding this convenient thing and that
and putting them aside for to-morrows launch my
movements were slow and the time passed quickly
insensibly the daylight crept upon me

  the chanting died down giving place to a clam-
our then it began again and suddenly broke into
a tumult i heard cries of more more a sound
like quarrelling and a sudden wild shriek the
quality of the sounds changed so greatly that it ar-
rested my attention i went out into the yard and
listened then cutting like a knife across the con-
fusion came the crack of a revolver

  i rushed at once through my room to the little
doorway as i did so i heard some of the packing-
cases behind me go sliding down and smash to-
gether with a clatter of glass on the floor of the
shed but i did not heed these i flung the door
open and looked out

  up the beach by the boathouse a bonfire was
burning raining up sparks into the indistinctness
of the dawn around this struggled a mass of
black figures i heard montgomery call my name
i began to run at once towards this fire revolver
in hand i saw the pink tongue of montgomerys
pistol lick out out once close to the ground he
was down i shouted with all my strength and fired

into the air i heard some one cry the master
the knotted black struggle broke into scattering
units the fire leapt and sank down the crowd of
beast people fled in sudden panic before me up
the beach in my excitement i fired at their retreat-
ing backs as they disappeared among the bushes
then i turned to the black heaps upon the ground

  montgomery lay on his back with the hairy-
grey beast-man sprawling across his body the
brute was dead but still gripping montgomerys
throat with its curving claws near by lay mling
on his face and quite still his neck bitten open and
the upper part of the smashed brandy-bottle in his
hand two other figures lay near the fire-the
one motionless the other groaning fitfully every
now and then raising its head slowly then dropping
it again

  i caught hold of the grey man and pulled him off
montgomerys body his claws drew down the torn
coat reluctantly as i dragged him away mont-
gomery was dark in the face and scarcely breath-
ing i splashed sea-water on his face and pillow-
ed his head on my rolled-up coat mling was dead
the wounded creature by the fire-it was a wolf-
brute with a bearded grey face-lay i found with
the fore part of its body upon the still glowing
timber the wretched thing was injured so dread-
fully that in mercy i blew its brains out at once
the other brute was one of the bull-men swathed
in white he too was dead the rest of the beast
people had vanished from the beach

  i went to montgomery again and knelt beside
him cursing my ignorance of medicine the fire
beside me had sunk down and only charred beams
of timber glowing at the central ends and mixed
with a grey ash of brushwood remained i won-
dered casually where montgomery had got his wood
then i saw that the dawn was upon us the sky
had grown brighter the setting moon was becom-
ing pale and opaque in the luminous blue of the
day the sky to the eastward was rimmed with
red

 suddenly i heard a thud and a hissing behind me
and looking round sprang to my feet with a cry of
horror against the warm dawn great tumultuous
masses of black smoke were boiling up out of the en-
closure and through their stormy darkness shot
flickering threads of blood-red flame then the
thatched roof caught i saw the curving charge of
the flames across the sloping straw a spurt of fire
jetted from the window of my room

  i knew at once what had happened i remembered
the crash i had heard when i had rushed out to
montgomerys assistance i had overturned the
lamp

  the hopelessness of saving any of the contents of
the enclosure stared me in the face my mind came
back to my plan of flight and turning swiftly i
looked to see where the two boats lay upon the
beach they were gone two axes lay upon the
sands beside me chips and splinters were scattered
broadcast and the ashes of the bonfire were black-
ening and smoking under the dawn montgomery
had burnt the boats to revenge himself upon me
and prevent our return to mankind

  a sudden convulsion of rage shook me i wag
almost moved to batter his foolish head in as he
the island of dr moreau



lay there at my feet then suddenly his hand
moved so feebly so pitifully that my wrath van-
ished he groaned and opened his eyes for a
minute i knelt down beside him and raised his
head he opened his eyes again staring silently
at the dawn and then they met mine the lids
fell

  sorry he said presently with an effort he
seemed trying to think the last he murmured
the last of this silly universe what a mess-

  i listened his head fell helplessly to one side
i thought some drink might revive him but there
was neither drink nor vessel in which to bring drink
at hand he seemed suddenly heavier my heart
went cold i bent down to his face put my hand
through the rent in his blouse he was dead
and even as he died a line of white heat the limb
of the sun rose eastward beyond the projection of
the bay splashing its radiance across the sky and
turning the dark sea into a weltering tumult of
dazzling light it fell like a glory upon his death-
shrunken face

  i let his head fall gently upon the rough pillow
i had made for him and stood up before me was
the glittering desolation of the sea the awful soli-
tude from which i had already suffered so much
behind me the island hushed under the dawn its
beast people silent and unseen the enclosure
with all its provisions and ammunition burnt noisi-
ly with sudden gusts of flame a fitful crackling
and now and then a crash the heavy smoke drove
up the beach away from me rolling low over the
distant tree-tops towards the huts in the ravine
beside me were the charred vestiges of the boats
and these four dead bodies

  then out of the bushes came three beast people
with hunched shoulders protruding heads mis-
shapen hands awkwardly held and inquisitive un-
friendly eyes and advanced towards me with
hesitating gestures

chapter xx
alone with the beast folk

 faced these people facing my fate in them
single-handed now-literally single-handed
for i had a broken arm in my pocket was a re-
volver with two empty chambers among the chips
scattered about the beach lay the two axes that had
been used to chop up the boats the tide was creep-
ing in behind me there was nothing for it but
courage i looked squarely into the faces of the ad-
vancing monsters they avoided my eyes and their
quivering nostrils investigated the bodies that lay
beyond me on the beach i took half-a-dozen steps
picked up the blood-stained whip that lay beneath
the body of the wolf-man and cracked it they
stopped and stared at me

  salute said i bow down

  they hesitated one bent his knees i repeated
my command with my heart in my mouth and ad-
vanced upon them one knelt then the other two

  i turned and walked towards the dead bodies
keeping my face towards the three kneeling beast
men very much as an actor passing up the stage
faces the audience

  they broke the law said i putting my foot

on the sayer of the law they have been slain-
even the sayer of the law even the other with
the whip great is the law come and see

  none escape said one of them advancing and
peering

  none escape said i therefore hear and do
as i command they stood up looking question-
ingly at one another

  stand there said i

  i picked up the hatchets and swung them by their
heads from the sling of my arm turned mont-
gomery over picked up his revolver still loaded
in two chambers and bending down to rummage
found half-dozen cartridges in his pocket

  take him said i standing up again and point-
ing with the whip take him and carry him out
and cast him into the sea

  they came forward evidently still afraid of mont-
gomery but still more afraid of my cracking red
whip-lash and after some fumbling and hesitation
some whip-cracking and shouting they lifted him
gingerly carried him down to the beach and were
splashing into the dazzling welter of the sea

  on said i on carry him far

  they went in up to their armpits and stood re-
garding me

  let go said i and the body of montgomery
vanished with a splash something seemed to
tighten across my chest

  good said i with a break in my voice and
they came back hurrying and fearful to the mar-
gin of the water leaving long wakes of black in
the silver at the waters edge they stopped turn-
ing and glaring into the sea as though they pres-
ently expected montgomery to arise therefrom and
exact vengeance

  now these said i pointing to the other bodies

  they took care not to approach the place where
they had thrown montgomery into the water but
instead carried the four dead beast people slant-
ingly along the beach for perhaps a hundred yards
before they waded out and cast them away

  as i watched them disposing of the mangled re-
mains of mling i heard a light footfall behind
me and turning quickly saw the big hyena-swine
perhaps a dozen yards away his head was bent
down his bright eyes were fixed upon me his
stumpy hands clenched and held close by his side
he stopped in his crouching attitude when i turned
his eyes a little averted

  for a moment we stood eye to eye i dropped the
whip and snatched at the pistol in my pocket for
i meant to kill this brute the most formidable of
any left now upon the island at the first excuse
it may seem treacherous hut so i was resolved i
was far more afraid of him than of any other two
of the beast folk his continued life was i knew
a threat against mine

  i was perhaps a dozen seconds collecting myself
then cried i salute bow down

  his teeth flashed upon me in a snarl who are
you that i should-

  perhaps a little too spasmodically i drew my
revolver aimed quickly and fired i heard him
yelp saw him run sideways and turn knew i had
missed and clicked back the cock with my thumb
for the next shot but he was already running


amazing stories

headlong jumping from side to side and i dared
not risk another miss every now and then he
looked back at me over his shoulder he went
slanting along the beach and vanished beneath the
driving masses of dense smoke that were still pour-
ing out from the burning enclosure for some time
i stood staring after him i turned to my three
obedient beast folk again and signalled them to
drop the body they still carried then i went back
to the place by the fire where the bodies had fallen
and kicked the sand until all the brown blood-stains
were absorbed and hidden

  i dismissed my three serfs with a wave of the
hand and went up the beach into the thickets i
carried my pistol in my hand my whip thrust with
the hatchets in the sling of my arm i was anxious
to be alone to think out the position in which i
was now placed a dreadful thing that i was only
beginning to realise was that over all this island
there was now no safe place where i could be alone
and secure to rest or sleep i had recovered strength
amazingly since my landing but i was still inclined
to be nervous and to break down under any great
stress i felt that i ought to cross the island and
establish myself with the beast people and make
myself secure in their confidence but my heart
failed me i went back to the beach and turning
eastward past the burning enclosure made for a
point where a shallow spit of coral sand ran out
towards the reef here i could sit down and think
my back to the sea and my face against any sur-
prise and there i sat chin on knees the sun beat-
ing down upon my head and unspeakable dread in
my mind plotting how i could live on against the
hour of my rescue if ever rescue came i tried to
review the whole situation as clamly as i could
but it was difficult to clear the thing of emotion

  i began turning over in my mind the reason of
montgomerys despair they will change he
said they are sure to change and moreau
what was it that moreau had said the stubborn
beast-flesh grows day by day back again then
i came round to the hyena-swine i felt sure that
if i did not kill that brute he would kill me the
sayer of the law was dead worse luck they knew
now that we of the whips could be killed even as
they themselves were killed were they peering
at me already out of the green masses of ferns and
palms over yonder watching until i came within
their spring were they plotting against me
what was the hyena-swine telling them my
imagination was running away with me into a
morass of unsubstantial fears

  my thoughts were disturbed by a crying of sea-
birds hurrying towards some black object that had
been stranded by the waves on the beach near the
enclosure i knew what that object was but i had
not the heart to go back and drive them off- i be-
gan walking along the beach in the opposite direc-
tion designing to come round the eastward corner
of the island and so approach the ravine of the
huts without traversing the possible ambuscades
of the thickets

  perhaps half a mile along the beach i became
aware of one of my three beast folk advancing
out of the landward bushes towards me i was
now so nervous with my own imaginings that i

immediately drew my revolver even the pro-
pitiatory gestures of the creature failed to disarm
me he hesitated as he approached

  go away cried i

  there was something very suggestive of a dog
in the cringing attitude of the creature it re-
treated a little way very like a dog being sent
home and stopped looking at me imploringly with
canine brown eyes

  go away said i do not come near me

  may i not come near you it said

  nof go away i insisted and snapped my
whip then putting my whip in my teeth i stoop-
ed for a stone and with that threat drove the
creature away

  so in solitude i came round by the ravine of the
beast people and hiding among the weeds and
reeds that separated this crevice from the sea i
watched such of them as appeared trying to judge
from their gestures and appearance how the
death of moreau and montgomery and the destruc-
tion of the house of pain had affected them i
know now the folly of my cowardice had i kept
my courage up to the lvel of the dawn had i
not allowed it to ebb away in solitary thought i
might have grasped the vacant sceptre of moreau
and ruled over the beast people as it was i lost
the opportunity and sank to the position of a
mere leader among my fellows

  towards noon certain of them came and squat-
ted basking in the hot sand the imperious voices
of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread i
came out of the bushes and revolver in hand
walked down towards these seated figures one
a wolf-woman turned her head and stared at me
and then the others none attempted to rise or
salute me i felt too faint and weary to insist and
i let the moment pass

  i want food said i almost apologetically and
drawing near

  there is food in the huts said an ox-boar-
man drowsily and looking away from me

  i passed them and went down into the shadow
and odours of the almost deserted ravine in an
empty hut i feasted on some specked and half-
decayed fruit and then after i had propped some
branches and sticks about the opening and placed
myself with my face towards it and my hand up-
on my revolver the exhaustion of the last thirty
hours claimed its own and i fell into a light
slumber hoping that the flimsy barricade i had
erected vould cause sufficient noise in its removal
to save me from surprise

chapter xxi

the reversion of the beast folk

in this way i became one among the beast
people in the island of doctor moreau when
i awoke it was dark about me my arm
ached in its bandages i sat up wondering at first
where i might be i heard coarse voices talking
outside then i saw that my barricade had gone
and that the opening of the hut stood clear my
revolver was still in my hand

  i heard something breathing saw something
crouched together close beside me i held my
the island of dr moreau



breath trying to see what it was it began to
move slowly interminably then something soft
and warm and moist passed across my hand all
my muscles contracted i snatched my hand away
a cry of alarm began and was stifled in ray throat
then i just realised what had happened sufficiently
to stay my fingers on the revolver

  who is that i said in a horse whisper the
revolver still pointed

  i-master

  who are you

  they say there is no master now but i know
i know i carried the bodies into the sea 
walker in the sea the bodies of those you slew
i am your slave master

  are you the one i met on the beach i asked

  the same master

  the thing was evidently faithful enough for it
might have fallen upon me as i slept it is well
i said extending my hand for another licking kiss
i began to realise what its presence meant and
the tide of my courage flowed where are the
others i asked

  they are mad they are fools said the dog-
man even now they talk together beyond there
they say the master is dead the other with the
whip is dead that other who walked in the sea
is as we are we have no master no whips no-
house of pain any more there is an end we
love the law and will keep it but there is no pain
no master no whips for ever again so they say
but i know master i know

  i felt in the darkness and patted the dog-mans
head it is well i said again

  presently you will slay them all said the dog-
man

  presently i answered i will slay them all-
after certain days and certain things have come
to pass every one of them save those you spare
every one of them shall be slain

  what the master wishes to kill the master
kills said the dog-man with a certain satisfaction
in his voice

  and that their sins may grow i said let
them live in their folly until their time is ripe let
them not know that i am the master

  the masters will is sweet said the dog-man
with the ready tact of his canine blood

  but one has sinned said i him i will kill
whenever i may meet him when i say to you
that is he see that you fall upon him and now
i will go to the men and women who are assembled
together

  for a moment the opening of the hut was black-
ened by the exit of the dog-man then i followed
and stood up almost in the exact spot where i
had been when i had heard moreau and his stag-
hound pursuing me but now it was night and
all the miasmatic ravine about me was black and
beyond instead of a green sunlit slope i saw a
red fire before which hunched grotesque figures
moved to and fro farther were the thick trees
a bank of darkness fringed above with the black
lace of the upper branches the moon was just
riding up on the edge of the ravine and like a
bar across its face drove the spire of vapour that

was for ever streaming from the fumaroles of tho
island

  walk by me said i nerving myself and side
by side we walked down the narrow way taking
little heed of the dim things that peered at us out
of the huts

  none about the fire attempted to salute me most
of them disregarded me ostentatiously i looked
round for the hyena-swine but he was not there
altogether perhaps twenty of the beast folk squat-
ted staring into the fire or talking to one another

  he is dead he is dead the master is dead
said the voice of the ape-man to the right of me
the house of pain-there is no house of pain

  he is not dead said i in a loud voice even
now he watches us

  this startled them twenty pairs of eyes re-
garded me

  the house of pain is gone said i it will
come again the master you cannot see yet even
now he listens among you

  true true said the dog-man

  they were staggered at my assurance an ani-
mal may be ferocious and cunning enough but it
takes a real man to tell a lie

  the man with tlie bandaged arm speaks a
strange thing said one of the beast folk

  i tell you it is so i said the master and the
house of pain will come again woe be to him
who breaks the law

  they looked curiously at one another with an
affectation of indifference i began to chop idly at
the ground in front of me with my hatchet they
looked i noticed at the deep cuts i made in the
turf

  then the satyr raised a doubt i answered him
then one of the dappled things objected and an
animated discussion sprang up round the fire
every moment i began to feel more convinced of
my present security i talked now without the
catching in my breath due to the intensity of my
excitement that had troubled me at first in the
course of about an hour i had really convinced sev-
eral of the beast folk of the truth of my asser-
tions and talked most of the others into a dubious
state i kept a sharp eye for my enemy the hyena-
swine but he never appeared every now and then
a suspicious movement would startle me but my
confidence grew rapidly then as the moon crept
down from the zenith one by one the listeners be-
gan to yaw showing the oddest teeth in the light
of the sinldng fire and first one and then another
retired towards the dens in the ravine and i
dreading the silence and darkness went with them
knowing i was safer with several of them than
with one alone

  in this manner began the longer part of my so-
journ upon this island of doctor moreau but
from that night until the end came there was but
one thing happened to tell save a series of innumer-
able small unpleasant details and the fretting of an
incessant-uneasiness so that i prefer to make
no chronicle for that gap of time to tell only one
cardinal incident of the ten months i spent as an
intimate of these half-humanized brutes there is
much that sticks in my memory that i could write
-things that i would cheerfully give my right


amazing stories

hand to forget but they do not help the telling of
the story

  in the retrospect it is strange to remember how
soon i fell in with these monsters ways and gained
my confidence again i had my quarrels with them
of course and could show some of their teeth-mark
still but they soon gained a wholesome respect for
my trick of throwing stones and for the bite of
my hatchet and my saint-bernard-mans loyalty
was of infinite service to me i found their simple
scale of honour was based mainly on the capacity
for inflicting trenchant wounds indeed i may
say-without vanity i hope-that i held something
like pre-eminence among them one or two whom
in a rare access of high spirits i had scarred rather
badly bore me a grudge but it vented itself chiefly
behind my back and at a safe distance from my
missiles in grimaces

  the hyena-swine avoided me and i was always
on the alert for him my inseparable dog-man hated
and dreaded him intensely i really believe that
was at the root of the brutes attachment to me
it was soon evident to me that the former monster
had tasted blood and gone the way of the leopard-
man he formed a lair somewhere in the forest
and became solitary once i tried to induce the
beast folk to hunt him but i lacked the authority
to make them co-operate for one end again and
again i tried to approach his den and come upon
him unaware but always he was too acute for me
and saw  winded me and got away he too made
-every forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally
with his lurking ambuscades the dog-man scarce-
ly dared to leave my side

  in the first month or so the beast folk com-
pared with their latter condition were human
enough and for one  two besides my canine friend
i even conceived a friendly tolerance the little
pink sloth-creature displayed an odd affection for
me and took to following me about the monkey-
man bored me however he assumed on the
strength of his five digits that he was my equal
and was forever jabbering at me-jabbering the
most arrant nonsense one thing about him enter-
tained me a little he had a fantastic trick of
coining new words he had an idea i believe that
to gabble about names that meant nothing was the
proper use of speech he called it big thinks
to distinguish it from little thinks the sane
every-day interests of life if ever i made a re-
mark he did not understand he would praise it very
much ask me to say it again learn it by heart
and go off repeating it with a word wrong here or
there to all the milder of the beast people he
thought nothing of what was plain and comprehen-
sible i invented some very curious big thinks
for his especial use i believe now that he was the
silliest creature i never met he had developed in
the most wonderful way the distinctive silliness of
man without losing one jot of the natural folly
of a monkey

  this i say was in the earlier weeks of my
solitude among these brutes during that time
they respected the usage established by the law
and behaved with general decorum once i found
another rabbit torn to pieces-by the hyena-
swine i am assured-but that was all it was

  about may when i first distinctly perceived a grow-
ing difference in their speech and carriage a grow-
ing coarseness of articulation a growing disinclina-
tion to talk my monkey-mans jabber multiplied
in volume but grew less and less comprehensible
more and more simian some of the others seemed
altogether slipping their hold upon speech though
they still understood what i said to them at that
time can you imagine language once clear-cut
and exact softening and guttering losing shape and
import becoming mere lumps of sound again
and they walked erect with an increasing difficulty
though they evidently felt ashamed of themselves
every now and then i would come upon one or
another running on toes and finger-tips and quite
unable to recover the vertical attitude they held
things more clumsily drinking by suction feeding
by gnawing grew commoner every day i realised
more keenly than ever what moreau had told me
about the stubborn beast-flesh they were re-
verting and reverting very rapidly

  my dog-man imperceptibly slipped back to the
dog again day by day he became dumb quad-
rupedal hairy i scarcely noticed the transition
from the companion on my right hand to the lurch-
ing dog at my side

  as the carelessness and disorganisation increased
from day to day the lane of dwelling-places at no
time very sweet became so loathsome that i left
it and going across the island made myself a hovel
of boughs amid the black ruins of moreaus en-
closure some memory of pain i found still made
that place the safest from the beast folk

  it would be impossible to detail every step of the
lapsing of these monsters-to tell how day by
day the human semblance left them how they
gave up bandagings and wrappings abandoned at
last every stitch of clothing how the hair began
to spread over the exposed limbs how their fore-
heads fell away and their faces projected how the
quasi-human intimacy i had permitted myself with
some of them in the first month of my loneliness
became a shuddering horror to recall

  the change was slow and inevitable for them
and for me it came without any definite shock i
still went among them in safety because no jolt
in the downward glide had released the increasing
charge of explosive animalism that ousted the
human day by day but i began to fear that soon
now that shock must come my saint-bernard-
brute followed me to the enclosure every night and
his vigilance enabled me to sleep at times in some-
thing like peace the little pink sloth-thing became
shy and left me to crawl back to its natural life
once more among the tree-branches we were in
just the state of equilibrium that would remain in
one of those happy family cages which animal-
tamers exhibit if the tamer were to leave it for
ever

  of course these creatures did not decline into
such beasts as the reader has seen in zoological
gardens-into ordinary bears wolves tigers oxen
swine and apes there was still something strange
about each in each moreau had blended this animal
with that one perhaps was ursine chiefly but
each was tainted with other creatures-a kind of
generalised animalism appearing through tho
the island of dr moreau



  specific dispositions and the dwindling shreds
of the humanity still startled me every now and
then-a momentary recrudescence of speech per-
haps an unexpected dexterity of the fore-feet a
pitiful attempt to walk erect

  i too must have undergone strange changes my
clothes hung about me as yellow rags through
whose rents showed the tanned skin my hair grew
long and became matted together i am told that
even now my eyes have a strange brightness a
swift alertness of movement

  at first i spent the daylight hours on the south-
ward beach watching for a ship hoping and pray-
ing for a ship i counted on the ipecacuanha re-
turning as the year wore on but she never came
five times i saw sails and thrice smoke but noth-
ing ever touched the island i always had a bon-
fire ready but no doubt the volcanic reputation of
the island was taken to account for that

  it was only about september or october that i
began to think of making a raft by that time
my arm had healed and both my hands were at my
service again at first i found my helplessness ap-
palling i had never done any carpentry or such-
like work in my life and i spent day after day in
experimental chopping and binding among the
trees i had no ropes and could hit on nothing
wherewith to make ropes none of the abundant
creepers seemed limber or strong enough and with
all my litter of scientific education i could not de-
vise any way of making them so i spent more
than a fortnight grubbing among the black ruins of
the enclosure and on the beach where the boats had
been burnt looking for nails and other stray pieces
of metal that might prove of service now and then
some beast-creature would watch me and go leaping
off when i called to it there came a season of
thunder-storms and heavy rain which greatly re-
tarded my work but at last the raft was completed

  i was delighted with it but with a certain lack
of practical sense which has always been my bane
i had made it a mile or more from the sea and be-
fore i had dragged it down to the beach the thing
had fallen to pieces perhaps it is as well that i
was saved from launching it but at the time my
misery at my failure was so acute that for some
days i simply moped on the beach and stared at
the water and thought of death

  i did not however mean to die and an incident
occurred that warned me unmistakably of the folly
of letting the days pass so-for each fresh day was
fraught with increasing danger from the beast
people

  i was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall
staring out to sea when i was startled by something
cold touching the skin of my heel and starting
round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking
into my face he had long since lost speech and
active movement and the lank hair of the little
brute grew thicker every day and his stumpy claws
more askew he made a moaning noise when he
saw he had attracted my attention went a little way
towards the bushes and looked back at me

  at first i did not understand but presently it
occurred to me that he wished me to follow him
and this i did at last-slowly for the day was hot
when we reached the trees he clambered into them

  for he could travel better among their swinging
creepers than on the ground and suddenly in a
trampled space i came upon a ghastly group my
saint-bernard-creature lay on the ground dead
and near his body crouched the hyena-swine grip-
ping the quivering flesh with its misshapen claws
gnawing at it and snarling with delight as i ap-
proached the monster lifted its glaring eyes to
mine its lips went trembling back from its red-
stained teeth and it growled menacingly it was
not afraid and not ashamed the last vestige of the
human taint had vanished i advanced a step
farther stopped and pulled out my revolver at
last i had him face to face

  the brute made no sign of retreat but its ears
went back its hair bristled and its body crouched
together i aimed between the eyes and fired as
i did so the thing rose straight at mo in a leap
and i was knocked over like a ninepin it clutched
at me with its crippled hand and struck me in the
face its spring carried it over me i fell under
the hind part of its body but luckily i had hit
as i meant and it had died even as it leapt i
crawled out from under its unclean weight and
stood up trembling staring at its quivering body
that danger at least was over but this i knew
was only the first of the series of relapses that
must come

  i burnt both of the bodies on a pyre of brush-
wood but after that i saw that unless i left the
island my death was only a question of time the
beast people by that time had with one or two
exceptions left the ravine and made themselves
lairs according to their taste among the thickets
of the island few prowled by day most of them
slept and the island might have seemed deserted
to a new-comer but at night the air was hideous
with their calls and howling i had half a mind
to make a massacre of them to build traps or
fight them with my knife had i possessed sufficient
cartridges i should not have hesitated to begin the
killing there could now be scarcely a score left
of the dangerous carnivores the braver of these
were already dead after the death of this poor
dog of mine my last friend i too adopted to some
extent the practice of slumbering in the daytime in
order to be on my guard at night i rebuilt my den
in the walls of the enclosure with such a narrow
opening that anything attempting to enter must
necessarily make a considerable noise the crea-
tures had lost the art of fire too and recovered
their fear of it i turned once more almost pas-
sionately now to hammering together stakes and
branches to form a raft for my escape

  i	found a thousand difficulties i am an ex-
tremely unhandy man my schooling was over be-
fore the days of slojd but most of the require-
ments of a raft i met at last in some clumsy cir-
cuitous way or other and this time i took care of
the strength the only insurmountable obstacle
was that i had no vessel to contain the water i
should need if i floated forth upon these untravelled
seas i would have even tried pottery but the is-
land contained no clay i used to go moping about
the island trying with all my might to solve this
one last difficulty sometimes i would give way to
wild outbursts of rage and hack and splinter some


amazing stories

unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation but i
could think of nothing

  and then came a day a wonderful day which
i spent in ecstasy i saw a sail to the southwest
a small sail like that of a little schooner and forth-
with i lit a great pile of brushwood and stood by it
in the heat of it and the heat of the midday sun
watching all day i watched that sail eating or
drinking nothing so that my head reeled and the
beasts came and glared at me and seemed to won-
der and went away it was still distant when night
came and swallowed it up and all night i toiled to
keep my blaze bright and high and the eyes of the
beasts shone out of the darkness marvelling in
the dawn the sail was nearer and i saw it was the
dirty lug-sail of a small boat but it sailed strange-
ly my eyes were weary with watching and i
peered and could not believe them two men were
in the boat sitting low down-one by the bows
the other at the rudder the head was not kept to
the wind it yawed and fell away

  as the day grew brighter i began waving the
last rag of my jacket to them but they did not
notice me and sat still facing each other i went
to the lowest point of the low headland and gesti-
culated and shouted there was no response and
the boat kept on her aimless course making slowly
very slowly for the bay suddenly a great white
bird flew up out of the boat and neither of the men
stirred nor noticed it it circled round and then
came sweeping overhead with its strong wings out-
spread

  then i stopped shouting and sat down on the
headland and rested my chin on my hands and
stared slowly slowly the boat drove past towards
the west i would have swum out to it but some-
thing-a cold vague fear-kept me back and left
it a hundred yards or so to the westward of the
ruins of the enclosure the men in it were dead
had been dead so long that they fell to pieces when
i tilted the boat on its side and dragged them out
one had a shock of red hair like the captain of
the ipecacuanha and a dirty white cap lay in the
bottom of the boat

  as i stood beside the boat three of the beasts
came slinking out of the bushes and sniffing towards
me one of my spasms of disgust came upon me
i thrust the little boat down the beach and clam-
bered on board her two of the brutes were wolf-
beasts and came forward with quivering nostrils
and glittering eyes the third was the horrible
nondescript of bear and bullj when i saw them
approaching those wretched remains heard them
snarling at one another and caught the gleam of
their teeth a frantic horror succeeded my repulsion
i turned my back upon them struck the lug and
began paddling out to sea i could not bring my-
self to look behind me

  i lay however between the reef and the island
that night and the next morning went round to
the stream and filled the empty keg aboard with
water then with such patience as i could com-
mand i collected a quantity of fruit and waylaid
and killed two rabbits with my last three cartridges
while i was doing this i left the boat moored to
an inward projection of the reef for fear of the
beast people

the man alone

in the evening i started and drove out to sea
before a gentle wind from the southwest
slowly steadily and the island grew smaller
and smaller and the lank spire of smoke dwindled
to a finer and finer line against the hot sunset the
ocean rose up around me hiding that low dark
patch from my eyes the daylight the trailing
glory of the sun went streaming out of the sky
was drawn aside like some luminous curtain and
at last i looked into the blue gulf of immensity
which the sunshine hides and saw the floating
hosts of the stars the sea was silent the sky
was silent i was alone with the night and silence

  so i drifted for three days eating and drinking
sparingly and meditating upon all that had hap-
pened to me-not desiring very greatly then to see
men again one unclean rag was about me my
hair a black tangle no doubt my discoverers thought
me a madman

  it is strange but i felt no desire to return to
mankind i was only glad to be quit of the foul-
ness of the beast people and on the third day i
was picked up by a brig from apia to san fran-
cisco neither the captain nor the mate would be-
lieve my story judging that solitude and danger
had made me mad and fearing their opinion might
be that of others i refrained from telling my ad-
venture further and professed to recall nothing
that had happened to me between the loss of the
lady vain and the time when i was picked up
again-the space of a year

  i had to act with the utmost circumspection to
save myself from the suspicion of insanity my
memory of the law of the two dead sailors of the
ambuscades of the darkness of the body in the cane-
brake haunted me and unnatural as it seems
with my return to mankind came instead of that
confidence and sympathy i had expected a strange
enhancement of the uncertainty and dread i had
experienced during my stay upon the island no
one would believe me i was almost as queer to
men as i had been to the beast people i may have
caught something of the natural wildness of my
companions they say that terror is a disease and
anyhow i can witness that for several years now a
restless fear has dwelt in my mind-such a rest-
less fear as a half-tamed lion cub may feel

  my trouble took the strangest form i could not
persuade myself that the men and women i met
were not also another beast people animals half
wrought into the outward image of human souls
and that they would presently begin to revert
to show first this bestial mark and then that but
i have confided my case to a strangely able man-
a man who had known moreau and seemed half to
credit my story a mental specialist-and he has
helped me mightily though i do not expect that
the terror of that island will ever altogether leave
me at most times it lies far in the back of my
mind a mere distant cloud a memory and a faint
distrust but there are times when the little cloud
spreads until it obscures the whole sky then i
look about me at my fellow-men and i go in fear
i see faces keen and bright others dull or dan-
gerous others unsteady insincere-pono
the island of dr moreau



have the calm authority of a reasonable soul i
feel as though the animal was surging up through
them that presently the degradation of the is-
landers will be played over again on a larger scale
i know this is an illusion that these seeming men
and women about me are indeed men and women-
men and women for ever perfectly reasonable
creatures full of human desires and tender solici-
tude emancipated from instinct and the slaves of
no fantastic law-beings altogether different from
the beast folk yet i shrink from them from their
curious glances their inquiries and assistance and
long to be away from them and alone for that
reason i live near the broad free downland and can
escape thither when this shadow is over my soul
and very sweet is the empty downland then under
the wind-swept sky

  when i lived in london the horror was well-nigh
insupportable i could not get away from men
their voices came through windows locked doors
were flimsy safeguards i would go out into the
streets to fight with my delusion and prowling wo-
men would mew after me furtive craving men
glance jealously at me weary pale workers go
coughing by me with tired eyes and eager paces
like wounded deer dripping blood old people bent
and dull pass murmuring to themselves and all
unheeding a ragged tail of gibing children then
i would turn aside into some chapel-and even
there such was my disturbance it seemed that the
preacher gibbered big thinks even as the ape-
man had done or into some library and there the
intent faces over the books seemed but patient
creatures waiting for prey particularly nauseous
were the blank expressionless faces of people in

trains and omnibuses they seemed no more mtf
fellow-creatures than dead bodies would be so that
i did not dare to travel unless i was assured of
being alone and even it seemed that i too was not
a reasonable creature but only an animal tormented
with some strange disorder in its brain which sent
it to wander alone like a sheep stricken with gid

  this is a mood however that comes to me now
i thank god more rarely i have withdrawn my-
self from the confusion of cities and multitudes
and spend my days surrounded by wise books-
bright windows in this life of ours lit by the shin
ing souls of men i see few strangers and have
but a small household my days i devote to reading
and to experiments in chemistry and i spend many
of the clear nights in the study of astronomy
there is-though i do not know how there is or
why there is-a sense of infinite peace and protec-
tion in the glittering hosts of heaven there it must
be i think in the vast and eternal laws of matter
and not in the daily cares and sins and troubles
of men that whatever is more than animal within
us must find its solace and its hope i hope or i
could not live

  and so in hope and solitude my story ends

  tn this story we are told of a ship which strikes
j an iceberg and winning aground as it were
on a shelving projection is held in a sort of
prison and all except two leave the ship in the boats
the two who remain go ashore where one of them
dies and the survivor who is supposed to be the
ivriter of the story wanders over high hills until
he finds a great area below their level and descends
into this country which is warm and of fertile soil
although it is in the antarctic

  he tells of meeting strange beings that resemble
crustaceans who stand erect and are larger than

men but who arc of the utmost benevolence in
nature and prove in their own way to be highly
civilized he tells of their mode of life and of their
remarkable achievements they have a deep knowl-
edge of mechanics chemistry and other sciences
but have one curious restriction that they cannot
leave their country the reason will be eventually
told the story is supposed to be the contents of a
manuscript which was found in a curious receptacle
attached to an albatross and which was given pub-
licity by the finder who was supposed to be respon-
sible for telling the story

beyond the pole

chapter vi

f the inhabitants of this country which
i now feel sure is a continent or an im-
mense island in the unexplored area
beyond the south pole i might write
many pages but this manuscript must
not be too long for even written as it is on this
wonderfully thin and light material yet i must
have a care that it is not too heavy for the winged
messenger to whom i intend to entrust it

  i have already described to the best of my ability
the personal or physical appearance of the strange
beings among whom i fear i am destined to remain
for the rest of my life also i have spoken of
their means of communicating with one another and
with myself and here and there i have given short
accounts of their habits and occupations and of
their wonderful inventions and accomplishments
but as yet i have said nothing of their social or
family life their thoughts laws codes public in-
stitutions and many other matters which have
proved vastly interesting to me and may perhaps
interest my fellow men if fate wills that this manu-
script ever reaches them

there is so much to

write that is strange in-
credible and difficult to
describe that i hardly
know where to begin

many long months passed
before i could carry on
a thought conversation
clearly enough to get an
insight into many mat-
ters  but now that i have
been here for over a
year as nearly as i can
figure it out i am able to make myself understood
and to understand them as readily as if we spoke
a common language

  first perhaps i should mention that these crea-
tures are comparatively short lived they seldom
reach an age which in my world would be forty
years but as they mature in an incredibly short
time their lives are proportionately as long as our
own that is these creatures become fully grown
and with fully developed powers both mentally and

 in the concluding installment we find our explorer cn-
 meshed deeply in the talons-or should we say claws-
 of the crustacean civilisation imagine his feelings the
 onlyhuman being alone in such a land of wonders-and
 what is going to be the end will the lobster-like creat-
 ures stay beyond the pole or will they perhaps overrun
 the other habited part of the earth all of this of course
 you zvill find out as you go on reading the tale with
 breathless interest it is the best scientifietion story of
 the year so far and we know you will like it

physically in only a few weeks after emerging from
their eggs so that their life of full mental and
physical power is about forty years whereas hu-
man beings who require from twenty to thirty
years to reach full mental and physical power
would have to live to sixty or seventy years in order
to equal these beings moreover their mental and
physical powers remain unimpaired until death and
age as we know it does not exist thus their full
span of life is made available for their utmost en-
deavors i have spoken of them as hatching from
eggs and this was to me a most astounding thing
when i discovered it but after all it should not
have surprised me for being crustacean-like there
is no reason why they should not have crustacean-
like traits of development and life the eggs aro
deposited in places provided for the purposes and
are there carefully watched over by beings whose
lives are devoted to the purpose and the young
when they emerge from the eggs are separated
into groups each group or collection being destined
for training or i might say development for special
purposes thus one group will be destined for
miners another for chemists others for artizans
and so on and the number of young selected for

 each group is decided

by the demands for the
specific trades or pro-
fessions for which they
are destined thus if
there are a normal num-
ber of healthy and able
bodied miners and no
necessity for more none
of the young of that
particular time will be
destined for that trade
whereas if there are
say two thousand artizans needed that many
young will be set apart for development as artizans
also if the number of eggs exceeds the number
which the rulers deem necessary the surplus are
destroyed before the young emerge this is a mat-
ter determined by calculations as to the number of
beings who are expected to die during the year
and the number of inhabitants who can be safely
permitted to exist without danger of want or im-
proper accommodations as a result there is no




amazing stories

poverty no want no idleness and no suffering in
the entire country and no surplus or lack of any
trade or profession to me it seemed a most bar-
barous and inhuman practice at first but after all
they are not human and in many ways it is a most
admirable idea and i cannot help comparing the
extraordinary well-being and universal content of
these creatures with the dissatisfaction poverty
and suffering of the human race moreover there
is no sickness or illness among them any member
injured or ill is at once done away with for so
they argue to cure a sick or injured being neces-
sitates the services of one or more others even if
the ill or injured creature survives and recovers
whereas should he or she remain a cripple or unfit
for duty he or she is an impediment and may re-
quire the constant services of others as well as
the sustenance and support which might be better
devoted to healthy perfect individuals it may
seem a merciless system but these beings have no
sentiment affection or love as we know them

  their entire lives are devoted to the well being
of the whole community and to performing the
duties alloted them but i do not mean by that
they are lacking in pleasures or recreations or are
ceaseless workers like the ants they realize that
ceaseless labor drains their powers and that change
is a necessity and their hours of work and recrea-
tion are regulated but their recreations are to
me most strange they consist largely of frolick-
ing in the water like genuine water creatures or
of racing madly about in a sort of dance until utter-
ly exhausted also they have queer games and
athletic contests and in these they are often so
seriously injured as to result in their being done
away with not that the loss of a limb or of sev-
eral limbs amounts to much for these creatures can
lose nearly all their exterior organs and be none
the worse after a few weeks for like lobsters and
crabs they grow new limbs or appendages readily
and after shedding their skins or shells appear as
whole as ever this shedding process was of course
an astounding thing to me at first though quite
natural but it was i am told one of the greatest
drawbacks to their development and well-being and
in years long past was a terrific problem to solve
in those days thousands of the creatures shed their
old skins at the same time and for days thereafter
were soft tender almost helpless and unfit for
duty and thus the entire nation was at a standstill
and was exposed to the attacks of their enemies-
the giant ants and other creatures gradually how-
ever by changing diet and regulating the develop-
ment of eggs and young the creatures managed to
produce a race whose members did not shed all at
once but cast off their shells at various seasons so
that only a portion of their numbers were helpless
at one time moreover they found that garments
or coverings could be devised to protect their tender
bodies and permit them to perform certain duties

  of course though it was amazing to me at first
there are no real family ties and no such things as
love or marriage the males and females perform
equal work and are on perfect equality and merely
mate at the call of nature for the purpose of pro-
pagating the race at one time i understand the
beings mated for life and reared their own eggs and

young but the females gradually rebelled at being
forced to take no part in the industries and being
compelled to devote their time to domestic duties
and tfye rulers finding that the race was dying out
through neglect of eggs and young and that count-
less numbers of the dissatisfied females produced
no offspring were compelled to accede to the fe-
males demands and take over all eggs and young
as government wards this soon led to the females
refusing to mate for any considerable length of
time and gradually all family relations were done
away with also this led to the necessity of the
government predetermining the life and occupation
of each young individual and of destroying thou-
sands of eggs each season in the old days the
young of an artizan or a miner became miners or
artizans and inherited many of their parents traits
while the fact that the females were obliged to
rear their own young resulted in limited numbers
of progeny but with the new order of things it was
impossible to say who were the parents of the ac-
cumulated eggs and released from all care the
females produced far greater numbers of eggs than
could be raised without overcrowding the country

  also i am told the females in former times were
quite distinct from the males both in physical and
mental characters they were smaller weaker and
more delicate and were quiet docile and somewhat
affectionate but now i find that it is with the
utmost difficultythat the two sexes can be distin-
guished and that if anything the females are the
larger stronger and more hardy of the two in-
deed i was amazed to find that most of the soldiers
or police as well as many of the miners and laborers
were females and so i was told whatever troubles
 dissensions had arisen were always caused by
the aggressive females

  indeed i was informed confidentially that the
rulers had decided to limit the number of females
and were surreptitiously destroying all female
young not absolutely necessary for the propagation
of the race this was a most difficult matter for
several members of the government were females
and they were anxious to increase the numbers of
their sex until all power should be in female hands
to destroy a young creature after it had emerged
from the egg unless it is malformed is a most
serious crime and hitherto no one had been able to
distinguish a male from a female egg but so i
was told one of the greatest chemists or scientists
had discovered a means of determining the egg sex
and fortunately this scientist was a male the
secret had been assiduously kept from reaching the
females and so when eggs were to be destroyed the
males could select the female eggs for destruction

  another rather astounding trait that i discovered
was that these creatures are stone deaf when their
skins are first slied and that their ears are quite
useless until they have placed small pebbles within
them

  whether the presence of these stones enables
them to communicate with one another and with
me without sounds i cannot say but it is such
a remarkable habit that i feel sure it must have
some bearing on the matter see foot note by dr
lyman

  this habit and their habit of shedding led to a
most amusing incident soon after my arrival in this
place feeling in need of a bath i made my way
to the lake and disrobing plunged into the water
as i emerged i found a group of the creatures
gathered about my ragged clothing and examining
the garments with the greatest interest and evident
excitement then they insisted upon feeling of
my naked body and expressed the greatest amaze-
ment that i had changed so greatly in appearance
but they were still more amazed when i again put
on my clothes then one of the beings brought
several pebbles which he-with kindly intentions
no doubt-tried to insert in my ears it was with
the greatest difficulty that i prevented this and
when the creatures found that i could hear without
the bits of stone they were absolutely dumbfounded
neither could they understand-and cannot to this
day-why i should not be able to remain under
water for hours and crawl about on the bottom as
they do

  but to return to their lives and habits the
government as i have called it is not like anything
on our part of the earth there are to be sure
certain members of the race to whom i have re-
ferred as rulers but they are not rulers in the
ordinary sense the goverment if such it may be
called consists of a great number of individuals
chosen by the inhabitants to perform certain duties

  thus one lot had charge of the eggs another
regulates the production of metal another looks
after the food supplies another has charge of the
buildings and so on each community appoints a
certain number of the members of each of these
groups and those appointed cannot do anything nor
make any rules or decisions without the knowledge
and consent of the communities from which they
are appointed

  moreover as these regulators or committeemen
as i may call them are reared from the eggs with
the sole purpose of fulfilling such duties they have
no other objects or purposes in life and carry out
their duties honestly and to the best of their abili-
ties

  each one is delegated to his post for life and
if he or she fails to carry out his or her duties
or in any way disobeys the orders of the com-
munity dire punishment results

  in former times this was death but the beings
though so heartless and cold blooded in many ways
have done away with the death penalty now and
have hit upon a far more sensible plan which would
be a credit to human beings to destroy life they
argue is if the being is healthy and uninjured a
loss to the community and necessitates a vast

and xosjogy had not brought to his attention tho well known fact
that many if not all crustaceans possess this same habit indeed our
common decapods-lobsters and crabs-are altnost helpless nnd appear
to lack the sense of direction and the power of definite movements
and hearing until tiny grains of sand had been inserted in their
ears

  possibly in the super-developed crustaeean-like creatures mr
bishop describes the pebbles in the ears have soino bearing upon
their strange means of inter-communication acting possibly as sensi-
tive detectors to vibratory waves or as sound amplifiers to make the
waves audible mr bishop also forgot or was not aware that the
higher vertebrates and even human beings possess small bones or ony
objectsin the ears the exact use of these has never been definitely
ascertained althoughit is known that they control the sense of bal-
 is possible that they also serve to pick up iti-
cudiblc waves and thus give human beings and other mammals a
sense of direction or the sixth sense so much more developed in
eomc individuals than others it is even within the bounds of pos-
cioility that the inexplicable feats of mental telepathy and mind
reading may depend upon the development or sensitiveness of these
ear boues-a e l

amount of time and trouble in fitting another to
take the place of the individual destroyed so in-
stead of killing offenders the violator of law or
customs is sent to a far distant part of the country
which is devoted entirely to such offenders and
there is forced to rely upon his or her own resources
to live and succeed it is in this way that all the
communities are first established these convict
colonies as i might call them are under the super-
vision of the chief settlement and each year are
inspected

  if all is going well a certain number of the young
of both sexes and different professions is alloted
to them while if matters are not being carried out
satisfactorily the colony is broken up and the mem-
bers divided among other new colonies in still more
isolated parts of the land

  moreover any disturbances or troubles which
may arise or any rebellions against the authorities
are quickly quelled without loss of life or bloodshed
this is done by simply turning off the power in
the community where the trouble occurs and with-
out the power from the great central station the
beings are utterly helpless they cannot have light
cannot prepare food cannot use their airships and
cannot exist for any length of time

  i have spoken of the soldiers or police and have
said that as there is no further need for them they
are being given up and that no new members of
the force are being raised wars among themselves
are things of the distant past and the only use for
the police today is to regulate sanitary and other
rules and to act as escorts or guards and to prevent
injuries in crowds or through accidents but such
things are now so rare and the beings are so well
trained and so careful to follow out all rules and
regulations which they make themselves that the
police have little to do indeed i was told that the
occasion of my arrival was the first time that this
body had been called out in more than twenty years

  i have so often spoken of things occurring in
years past or of happenings ages ago that a word
of explanation is necessary there is i found a
group of the creatures whose sole duty is to keep
the history and records of the country and its deni-
zens these records are never written but are re-
tained in the minds of the historians and in-
credible as it may appear so long have these beings
been trained to this one duty that their power to
remember the most minute details is simply amaz-
ing they know nothing else to be sure and are
almost too helpless even to move or feed themselves
for every sense is devoted to storing away facts
for future reference of course one would think
that there must come a time when the historical
facts would become so numerous that no brain
could hold them but this is overcome in a very
clever manner

  no one member of the historian group is expected
to remember more than a certain number of facts
or more than a certain number of different facts
each member retains facts of his own particular
class which cover a certain period so that these
beings are like a number of volumes each year
the number of historians in each class is increased
by two or as i might say the living volumes of
the nations history are added to annually one of
the new members of each class absorbing and


amazing stories

memorizing all the data of the oldest historian in
his class while the other new member of each class
memorizes every event in his line which occurs dur-
ing the year following his appointment thus the
material known to the older members is always
duplicated in a young new member and cannot be
lost if the former dies -or -meets with an accident
while new events are recorded on fresh brains with-
out adding to the burden on the older ones at the
present time there are approximately twenty-thou-
sand of these living volumes of history and by
means of calculations-which i found far more in-
volved than working out a ships position by stars-
i found that the history thus available covers a
period of about thirty-two thousand years for in
earlier days the new members were not appointed
annually of course it is a rather difficult matter
to look up any certain fact with such a mental
history to refer to but the fact that each class or
line of incidents is in the mental charge of separate
beings renders it more easy thus there are beings
who knows nothing of history-with the exception of
industrial events others know only those occur-
rences related to politics others to inventions
others to wars and still others whose minds are
filled with facts and data regarding scientific mat-
ters

  but as i have said before there is no such time
as years as we know them all time being divided
or calculated from generation to generation but
as the new broods of the creatures arrive very
nearly a year apart-as nearly as i can figure it out
-their computation of time corresponds roughly
with our years and now while i think of it let
me mention a most remarkable thing which at-
tracted my attention from the first but which re-
mained a mystery to me for a long time i men-
tioned that when i first reached the land i noted
an intense blue quality to the light and after my
first amazement at the strange inhabitants and my
confusion at my surroundings had passed i noticed
that there was no night at first i thought that i
was mistaken in this and that i had merely slept
the twenty-four hours through but i soon dis-
covered that darkness never descended on this land
and that bright light streamed steadily from the
sky i had thought thiswas most amazing and that
the sun always shone but i soon found that this
was not the case and that there were streamers of
light like the aurora which however remained
steadfast and like great bands of blinding flame
constantlyshedding their light upon the place more-
over these bands gave as i have said a blue or
rather violet light but whether this was the actual
color of the light itself or was due to some peculiar-
ity in the atmosphere i have never learned

  i feel sure however that this ceaseless daylight
and the fact that the warm and balmy climate
never varies ten degrees was the cause of all animal
life growing to huge proportions and also aided
the strange crustacean-like beings to reach such a
high state of development it also accounted for
their dwelling being underground while the blue
quality of the light-was i found an important fac-
tor in many things later as i shall explain i
discovered that without it many remarkable things
were impossible but i am digressing and must re-
turn to the subject of the inhabitants although it

was the fact that the light had a great influence
on them that caused me to make a note of the double
suns and the light at this point of my narrative

  i stated that each class of the inhabitants was
distinct and that the appendages of a miner arti-
zan chemist etc were adapted to the duties of each
and yet i soon found that the newly hatched young
were all identical moreover they bore no slightest
resemblance to the adults they were in fact
pulpy soft misshapen things with immense goggle
eyes spiny heads and with slender worm-like
naked bodies bearing ten little flipper-like append-
ages a few hours after hatching out they shed
their skins and altered in appearance and every
day or two thereafter their shells were cast and
with each shedding they became more and more like
the full grown creatures but during this period
between hatching and- full development they could
be incredibly altered or changed by being fed with
certain foods or chemicals and by being exposed to
certain forces or i might say rays produced by
combinations of the black mineral and sulphur com-
pounds thus if a batch of young is selected to be
chemists they are specially treated as soon as
hatched and each time their skins are cast their ap-
pendages become more and more like those of the
chemists until when fully developed they are per-
fectly adapted to their predestined trade

  i must not forget too to call attention to the
fact that there are no rich or well-to-do members
of the community that is in the way that we under-
stand riches some of the beings have more luxur-
ious homes than others some seem more brilliantly
garbed and some possess air ships while others do
not but anyone may if he or she desires have as
much as any of the others it is all a matter of
wishes and personal tastes for the resources of the
entire country are equally at the disposal of all not
that any inhabitant can demand a luxurious home
magnificently colored garments and a ftuge airship
whatever is allowed the being is his or her just
dues as a pro-rata share of all and if a taste runs
to airships rather than luxuries at -home the in-
dividual can follow his or her taste in the matter
all power light and sustenance are however equally
divided and there is no such thing as money or
trade services are the only values here and as
each trade or profession is predetermined all ser-
vices are accounted of equal value and there are no
social cliques or lines and no aristocracy a miner
or laborer is equal in every way to one of the rulers
or the guardians of the community and is entitled
to an equal share in everything needed

  but the large ships such as the one in which i
had traveled across the sea to the city were i found
community craft they are so to speak govern-
ment airships and constantly patrol the entire coun-
try or are used in carrying workers to far distant
places and distributing necessities and supplies
among the inhabitants they are the only means
of transportation and i was amazed that these be-
ings should have invented such marvelous craft and
yet know nothing of railways motor cars or in
fact any form of wheeled vehicle but i discovered
a short time ago why this is so and my discovery
was in many ways far more astonishing than any-
thing i had learned since reaching this remarkable
land
beyond the poke



chapter vii

i find that for some reason i have become
greatly changed since reaching this strange
country i have become philosophical or per-
haps i might better say pessimistic and i have
spent many hours pondering on matters to which
hitherto i gave no thought i have wondered why
these beings exist why they toil and labor and
progress and what part they play in the scheme ox
this universe when i have asked what object they
had in view why they strove i have been told
that it was for the good of the race for the
benefit of the nation for the future of their
kind exactly the same answers that i have
heard to similar queries from humans but
what i have wondered is that good that benefit
that future meaningless words i think here
are these creatures laboring that they may live
living that they may labor-in an endless circle to
be sure they have advanced in some ways far beyond
my fellow men and no doubt will advance still more
but of what avail they are but giant crustaceans
after all and they hatch from eggs toil through
life at the tasks to which they are trained and
come to their death and are forgotten after their
brief span of life has been spent and the world
knows not even that they exist and on the other
side of the world in the land of men human beings
are born labor and die utterly unknown to these
beings what does it all mean what place has it
all in the scheme of the universe i wonder and
when i think on such matters i feel that after all
my life is of little moment that though i am here
and my lot is cast among such weird beings it
makes no difference to the world or to the future
for i am but an atom of the whole one of countless
millions of cogs in the gigantic wheel of nature
and while i cannot fathom the riddle of life yet i
feel that i must have my place in the whole that
fate has seen fit to place me here and that even if
all the puny efforts of men and of these creatures
seem to lead nowhere yet must each one of us and
of them be as essential to the machinery of the
universe as any cog in a real wheel and without
which the whole vast mechanism would jar and jolt
and go wrong so instead of brooding upon my
lot and spending my time vainly wishing to regain
my fellow men i have become resigned

  but i can find no affection no liking no fellow
feeling for these beings they have treated me
kindly my every want is provided for and i occupy
a far more important place than ever i could have
filled in my world and in brains in attainments
and in many other ways these beings are even more
human than human beings yet so strongly in-
fluenced are we by physical appearances that to me
these creatures are still but beasts and i feel apart
from them and with little in common it is perhaps
akin to the feeling that one race of human beings
has for another the same feeling that prevents the
white and black races from thorough sympathy and
understanding and that creates prejudices and ill
feelings in the nations of the world i knew

  and another thing these beings though so
intelligent so industrious so far advanced are
such brainless silly creatures though they toil
and work feverishly and seem to have no idle mom-

ents to spare yet they will cease all will drop every-
thing and gather in crowds for the most trivial rea-
sons yes even without a reason let one of the
scurrying hurrying workers stop and gaze about
and instantly a crowd collects all gazing in the
same direction though there is nothing unusual
to be seen and quite forgetting the tasks on which
they were sent and they are childish to a degree
the simplest most nonsensical things will fascinate
them to such an extent that everything is at a
standstill

   wishing to find exercise and recreation i devised
a set of ninepins and a ball and at sight of these
the throngs grew wildly excited they gathered
about waving their antennae turning their long-
stalked eyes about dropping everything and for
an entire day practically all work was abandoned
while the beings amused themselves with my crude
toys tossing a ball and catching it spinning a
top and a score of other simple amusements proved
equally exciting and interesting to the beings and
the rulers begged me to confine my activities at
such things to recreation hours for fear a great
calamity might result

   but after all in such matters they are much like
men and i wonder if the planets are inhabited and
if their denizens also possess similar characteristics
and peculiarities

   all this however is leading me from the course
of my narrative i have mentioned that i dis-
covered why the beings had no vehicles save air-
ships and why though they were so far in advance
of human science they apparently knew nothing
of many of our most useful and important every
day matters and inventions

  it came about in this way

  i was seated upon the shores of the lake and
gazing across its broad and tranquil surface towards
the dim and distant mountain ranges sailor-like
my mind turned to boats what a pleasure it would
be i thought to have some good craft in which to
sail those waters to go where i willed and to ex-
plore the shores i had traveled much in the beings
airships but i could not handle the contraptions
and i longed for the feel of a keel under my feet
and why shouldnt my desires be satisfied to be
sure i knew that to secure wood to build a boat was
out of the question but there was the metal sul-
phur this could be made in thin sheets and a metal
boat could be constructed but then i thought
how would i manage to make the creatures under-
stand what i wanted and even if i did could
they bend and form and rivet the plates then a
brilliant idea came to me why shouldnt the boat
be fashioned of one single piece moulded or cast
into form it could be and thus made it would be
stronger and better in every way than if built up
of plates strange that i had not thought of it
sooner the airships hulls were thus formed and
i had only to make a model of the craft i wished
in order to have the creatures turn out a seamless
metal boat of incredible lightness and strength
for a time however even the simple matter of the
model puzzled me until it occurred to me to make
this from a very thin sheet of metal which after
considerable trouble i pounded and bent into the
desired shape

  the result of my work and rny efforts to make


amazing stories

the artizans grasp my ideas was a boat about eigh-
teen feet in length and five feet beam drawing about
three feet aft i cannot say the lines of the craft
were beautiful and i had no expectation of finding
her speedy but she was staunch and buoyant and
i thoroughly enjoyed fitting her up metal tubes
were used for mast and spars twisted fibre or yarns
of the same material as the beings used for their
textiles formed ropes and lines and the sails were
made of the same fabric all the time i was work-
ing the creatures regarded my labors with intense
interest though at an entire loss to know what i
was about but of all things the tackle and blocks
seemed to fascinate them the most and when at
last my craft was ready and i hoisted sails and
grasping the tiller trimmed the sheets and sped off
with a fresh breeze the creatures went almost mad
with excitement here indeed was a strange
condition of affairs beings who had gone far
beyond mans dreams in accomplishments who had
conquered the air and yet knew nothing of boats
or of sails and had never even seen blocks and
tackle

  of my cruises in the craft i need say little in
her i navigated the chain of great lakes or inland
seas visiting out of the way spots and landing on
the very place where i had first thrown myself upon
the beach to drink the water after my terrible jour-
ney here i again attempted to scale the mountains
as have already mentioned but either the climate
or the air had affected me for before i had ascended
half way to the summits of the ridge i was utterly
spent and was forced to retrace my steps this
was a great blow to me for i had hoped that sooner
or later i would be able to make my way back over
the mountains to the antarctic and that i thus
might rejoin my fellow men the perils i knew
were terrible and there was not one chance in a
million of my succeeding but even this slim chance
was i felt better than to remain forever among
the weird beings even when i found it impossible
i was not utterly discouraged possibly i thought
there might be lower spots in the mountain range
but in the end i found that the country was com-
pletely girded by towering mountains and that the
spot where i had crossed was the only point where
such a crossing had been possible but all this
is apart from what i was about to set down on
my explorations however i found that which had
a direct bearing upon my discovery as to why most
simple mechanical devices were unknown to the
creatures in one spot i discovered a vast deposit
of coal in another quantities of copper and i also
found iron silver gold and many other metals and
minerals oddly enough too the ores seemed to
have been mined for there were yawning openings
filled with debris which appeared to be old shafts
and tunnels and yet i knew the beings used none
of the metals nor coal but the discovery of the
latter started a new train of thought in my mind
could i not equip my craft with power and thus
be able to cruise about more rapidly and without
being dependent upon the wind  of course i might
have induced the creatures to supply me with the
strange invisible power they utilized but somehow
i longed for familiar things for devices with which
 was acquainted and i cannot hope to express the
great comfort and happiness i found in my little

boat moreover i felt the necessity of keeping
hands and mind busy and so i at once decided to
try my mechanical skill at designing and building
a small steam engine of course my knowledge of
machinery was limited but i knew the principles
of steam and steam engines and after weeks of
weary work and innumerable disappointments i
managed to turn out a crude sort of affair which
actually worked to be sure it was far too cumber-
some and heavy not to mention its small power for
my craft but once having mastered the affair i felt
that a second attempt would prove far easier and
more satisfactory than the first

  but the creatures who had  patched every step of
the work showed indescribable excitement as the
smoke rose from the funnel and the steam hissed
and the fly wheel revolved from far and near
they flocked more excited than i had ever seen
them and i realized how watt or fulton or other
great inventors must have felt when at last they
proved that their theories were right and had
demonstrated to a wondering multitude that steam
could be harnessed and made to serve man

  and then came an astounding discovery the
rulers wished to take possession of my crude engine
not to operate it but to place it in a special build-
ing a sort of museum as i might say as a prized
treasure this was i considered not unnatural
but when one of the historians-he who held the
most ancient records of the race-explained that in
the dim history of the past the beings had made and
used such things i was absolutely dumbfounded
no one he informed me had ever seen the ma-
chines they were merely tradition and were con-
sidered fabulous and all unwittingly i had material-
ized something which by them was regarded very
much as we regarded relics of the pharaohs or
of our prehistoric ancestors then the living
volume of the nations history went on to explain
that legendary lore had it that the creatures
ancient forebears had possessed many other
strange and unknown devices and i was asked if
i could not also make some of these as fellow ex-
hibits in the historical museum

  here then i found myself suddenly transformed
from a great inventor proud of exhibiting my
superior knowledge and mechanical ability to a
primitive being a being out of the dim past a mem-
ber of a race whose greatest achievements had been
known used and discarded by these super-crusta-
ceans so long ago that even history held no actual
records of them it was a great shock to my pride
but i was quite willing to busy myself at any work
that would keep me occupied even if it went only
to prove how far behind the times i wras and soon
i became vastly interested in the wrork and by my
efforts reconstructing the forgotten past for the
strange beings

  among the first things that i built was a cart
and this amazed the creatures even more than the
engine to them wheels were most marvelous
things akin i should say from their actions to
magic or witchcraft and i racked my brains to
puzzle out how it was that the wheel which i had
always considered mans most important mechanical
invention should have been discarded and forgotten
by the lobster-like beings man cannot get on with-
out the wheel it is the foundation the basis of
beyond the pole



all industry all machinery all our most wonderful
accomplishments and yet here was a nation of
highly intelligent creatures a race which had ad-
vanced immeasurably beyond humans in annihilat-
ing space and time beings who had tapped the very
source of natures storehouse of power and who
had made marvelous discoveries and never used a
wheel in any form to them the wheel was as ob-
solete and as useless as a stone axe or a flint knife
to us but instantly as they saw wheels they became
fascinated with their uses and possibilities not
that they were of any real benefit in their lives
or occupations but merely because they were
strange antique curiosities which afforded the be-
ings new amusements and sports soon carts or
wagons were everywhere and being most adaptable
creatures the inhabitants were not long in fitting
the vehicles with power receivers and were rattling
and bumping about in crude motor cars or rather
motor wagons as pleased as a lot of kids with new
toys

  i could not help thinking how this same power
applied to modern automobiles would revolutionize
jnotor cars in our world and i fell to work with a
will striving to construct some sort of car which
would be an improvement over the solid wheeled
uncomfortable things the creatures were using i
cannot say that the result of my labors and inven-
tive powers would have been a worthy rival even of
a tin lizzie but it had a greater vogue among the
beings than even fords famous product had among
humans and motoring became the favorite sport of
the entire country incredibly swift airships were
abandoned save for utility and business and just
as we human beings-or a large number of us-
prefer sail boats or rowing or even the primitive
savage canoe to the steam or power boat when it
comes to recreation or choose a slow-going horse
and carriage rather than a railway train or a motor
car for pleasure so they preferred the crude vehicles
bumping over the earth to the silent smooth sailing
meteor-like airships i cannot describe cannot hope
to give a picture of the ridiculous grotesque ap-
pearance the creatures presented in their new toys
and accidents were innumerable indeed i believe
it is the danger the risk in using land vehicles that
appeals most strongly to the creatures they seem
to delight in collisions in broken limbs and are
reckless beyond words no doubt the dangers are a
relief for their airships are so constructed that ac-
cidents are next to impossible and collisions cannot
occur for there are devices which operate in such a
way that if two ships come dangerously close the
mechanisms automatically operate to repel each
other

  few fatalities have however resulted from the
use of wheeled vehicles but beings lacking one or
more appendages or even antennae are seen every-
where and they are marvelously expert in avoiding
mishaps by a hairs breadth never have i seen
such mad driving and the worst traffic jams of new
yorks thoroughfares are nothing compared with
the congestion here in this metropolis of this
strange land and the wheels are used for many
other amusements too there are contraptions for
which i am responsible which might be called bicy-
cles and hoop-rolling is a sport over which the be-

ings grow as excited and become as interested as
human beings over golf or tennis

  and of course having seen the wonderful results
of my efforts and my to them prehistoric knowl-
edge i tried my hand at a thousand and one other
matters bows and arrows were most astounding
things to these beings and you can imagine my
amazement when not content with using a single
bow these weird creatures armed themselves with
three bows at once and discharged a perfect hail of
arrows at the targets what warriors they would
make i thought what unconquerable foes with
their ten appendages or limbs eight of which could
be used for handling weapons each in fact would
equal eight men in one and for the first time it
dawned upon me that herein was largely the secret
of their great achievements that they had been able
to accomplish eight times as much work as
humans and i wondered what the results would
have been had edison ford marconi or any of our
great inventors and geniuses been equipped by na-
ture to do eight times the work they have done

  their aptitude with such primitive weapons as
bows and arrows aroused my interest as to what
they would do with firearms and i bent my energies
and inventive powers to the task of making such
things there was an abundance of sulphur of
course saltpeter was to be had and charcoal was not
an impossibility but it was a long time before i
succeeded in making a mixture that would do more
than sputter and burn but at last i had an apology
for gunpowder and the rest was simple i had a
small cannon made and having loaded it and placed
a sheet metal target before it i touched it off my
powder was poor slow burning stuff but it served
to throw the ball and made a respectable detonation
but i was greatly disappointed at the effect upon the
assembled creatures who had gathered to watch the
demonstration the noise and smoke did not sur-
prise them in the least but i might have foreseen
this as they possessed an explosive far more power-
ful than powder or even dynamite in fact it was
altogether too powerful for use in firearms as i
discovered with almost fatal results to myself long
before i tried my hand at powder making they ex-
amined the ragged hole torn by the missile in the
metal target and they showed some interest in this
but their greatest wonder appeared to be that an
explosive capable of doing so much should have been
confined in the metal barrel of the gun aside from
this however the whole experiment failed to appeal
to them they had no use for such things as guns
and powder no need of offensive or defensive
weapons and their own explosive was a thousand
times more valuable than powder for their pur-
poses

  and scores of other things which i made after
endless failures and by dint of hardest work were
as useless to them as the cannon and then at last
it came to me that in this strange place mans great-
est inventions human beings most marvelous labor-
saving devices and our most prized luxuries and
conveniences had no place that here was a race
or nation of beings where there was no struggle for
supremacy no real industry for personal gain no
riches no poverty no competition that conditions
life everything were totally unlike those of my
world and that these creatures ages before my ar-


amazing stories

rival had passed the stage of human civilization and
that to them our customs habits and mode of life
would appear as barbarous and primitive as those
of the prehistoric cave dwellers to us

  there is no agriculture so no demand for agri-
cultural machinery no vast transportation of
foodstuffs and raw materials for with power wher-
ever required and food and all things needed-with
the exception of sulphur-available anywhere there
is little to be carried and airships are all that are
required all resources are equally at the disposal
of every member of the community and hence there
is no struggle for existence or for wealth and as
every member of the nation is developed trained
and predestined from the day of hatching for some
definite place in life there is no ambition no desire
for advancement in short these beings are mere
automatons machines endowed with life intelli-
gence and minds and nothing more they only
differ from insensate mechanisms inasmuch as they
have their times for rest and recreation and i daily
thank god that human beings have not yet come to
such a pass

  often when among my fellow men i have heard
arguments and have read articles in favor of a com-
munistic or socialistic life and government and
picturing the ideal utopia that the earth would be
if men could all be equal if all wealth could be
equally divided and there could be no class distinc-
tions no struggle for supremacy often too i have
in the past felt that such a state would be desirable
and many a time when fortune frowned upon me
and i compared my lot as a sailor with the ease and
luxury of wealthy passengers upon my ships or
with the rich ship owners i have felt bitterness
that some should beso favored and others forced to
struggle through life in poverty but now i realize
what dire results would follow were these socialists
ideas fulfilled now i realize that there could be no
ambition no desire for betterment no real happi-
ness in life and no pride if such conditions pre-
vailed no a thousand times no better dire
poverty unending toil the abuses and vices the
wars and strife all the wrongs and woes of mankind
and civilization than to become the heartless imper-
sonal beings that such conditions would lead to
what would the world of men be without love senti-
ment art music affection ambition what would
it be if the human race had no ideals beyond exis-
tence and the propagation of the species what
would it be if there was nothing to spur men on to
send them to sleep weary with the days work but
filled with dreams and visions of accomplishments
on the morrow to awaken them filled with deter-
mination to succeed to force their way to the top
what would life amount to if men had no aims no
ideals in life no necessity to exert themselves to
prove superiority to their fellows to force their
individuality upon the world and to choose their
path in life and to be independent free leading
their own lives as they see fit and with no limit save
their own intelligences and their labors to what they
may accomplish

  it is this this supposed idealistic sort of life of
these beings that made me so heartily sick of my
existence among them would that those who have
found such fault with our civilization who have
endeavored to revolutionize human life and human

ways and to upset conditions that the almighty in
his infinite wisdom has established might be hero
with me would that those socialistic agitators
might be forced to exist here among these creatures

  anything rather than this state of affairs at
times it seems as if i should go mad and i find my-
self longing for something anything to upset this
machine-like monotonous life about me anger
strife battle-aye even a war with all its horrors
would be welcome

chapter viii

along time has passed since i penned my
lines and now i know that beyond ques-
tion i am doomed to spend all my days
among these weird beings over and over again
i have attempted to find a way out to discover a
means of scaling the mountains for desperation
drove me and death upon the ice-covered wastes of
the polar regions seemed preferable to life here
but though strong healthy and as able-bodied as
ever yet for some strange reason i could not climb
those cliffs perhaps it is the food or drink that
has robbed me of the power to ascend even to
moderate heights perchance dwelling in this air
with its unending blue light has had its effect and
like the creatures who dwell here i cannot live
where once i felt no ill effects but whatever the
reason the fact remains that each time i have
reached a height of a few hundred feet my muscles
have failed me my strength has given out and i
have been forced to give up i am as hopelessly
caged here as though in a prison and yet the birds
come and go at will and i envy them beyond words
to express as i watch the broad-winged albatrosses
and great white molly-mokes and screeching gulls
and know on their pinions they can rise above the
surrounding mountains and leave this side of the
world for the other that i shall never see again
that no doubt they gaze upon my fellow men upon
the wide blue sea and upon white sailed ships and
great palatial steamships with the same express-
ionless eyes they turn upon me and upon the beings
dwelling here in this undreamed-of land

  to one of these free winged creatures these
friends of old who come over the edge of the world
each year i shall soon entrust this narrative per-
chance it may never reach a human being the bird
may meet with disaster or it may never look on a
civilized man or again even though scores hun-
dreds of my fellow men see the creatures yet it may
pass unnoticed and the message may not be read
but there is a chance that with the metal cylinder
in which i shall place my story dangling from its
leg the albatross will attract the attention of some
one perhaps its nesting ground may be near some
party of whalemen or even near a settlement and
it is this chance i cling to i have no fear that tho
cylinder will become detached or even broken de-
spite the rough treatment it will no doubt receive
and even if the bird is not found or the cylinder
discovered for years it and its contents will be
intact i have selected the toughest and hardest of
the many varieties of metal for the cylinder a metal
which is far harder than steel and which can be
opened or broken only by tremendous force or by a
heat greater than fire and i have used a trails-
beyond the pole



parent grade of the metal in order that any one
finding it may see that it contains a manuscript
for i -well know how curious human beings are to
read any scrap of writing that is picked up in a
floating or stranded bottle the cylinder being air
tight will preserve the manuscript and the writing
is done with a fluid i found among the waste or
by-products of the sulphur factory it is indelible
and will not fade while the cord by which i shall
attach the cylinder to my bird messenger is of the
toughest woven metal and cannot be severed by any
ordinary means

  and what if my narrative is found and read
will any mortal man believe it will the finder if
finder there be credit such a story as will be dis-
closed no i suppose not it is too incredible
too ridiculous to pass as anything more than fiction
or the ramblings of a disordered mind they will
think the writer crazy a madman who has been set
down the delusions of his brain or will think some
one is trying to perpetrate a gigantic hoax

  but again perhaps if god wills my narrative
may fall into the hands of some person who will be
attracted by the strangeness of its container the
transparent metal cylinder will perhaps arouse cu-
riosity the material on which it is written may give
credence to my tale and if so then will it be
known beyond a doubt that it is no wild fancy no
product of a crazy man for nowhere in the world
of men are such materials known often i smile to
myself to think what a sensation will be created
when the newspapers print accounts of the dis-
covery of the strange manuscript in a still more
remarkable container no doubt in that case my
story will be read by thousands perhaps millions
of my fellow men and yet the cylinder in which i
send it may prove of greater interest and value to
the world than my story i can picture the scien-
tists excitement as they analyze the metal and dis-
cussions grow hot as to its origin while inventors
strive to produce the same material for the benefit
of mankind

  such thoughts are a diversion and a comfort to
me and many hours i spend trying to picture in my
mind the results of my story and its effect upon the
world in case it ever reaches civilized men

  but i must cut short my imaginings my hopes
and fears for it is all aside from my tale and i must
confine myself to the story of my life here on this
unknown mountain-walled continent among these
weird beings

-x- - 

  since i last took up my manuscript to write many
events have occurred but that which is of greatest
importance though the creatures here make little of
it is the escape of the captive ants from the zoo
wherein they were confined

  to me there is something threatening in this
and i cannot rid myself of a feeling of a dire
calamity impending always i had been fascinated
by the gigantic insects and hours after hours i
have spent watching them as they labored and
rushed about drilling carrying on strange evolu-
tions marching and countermarching seemingly
aimlessly within their fenced enclosure

  that they could escape no one dreamed for as i
have said they were hedged in by network of ma-
terial fatal to them but escape they did and not

an ant remains within the pen nor was there a dead
ant to tell of the insects having touched the death
dealing netting no they had been far too intelli-
gent for that and their apparently aimless labors
had been but a clever ruse a means of concealing
their true purpose of tunelling to great depths and
by means of an unsuspected subterranean passage
vanishing no one knows where and i feel sure
that their constant drilling their military-like ac-
tions were no more purposeless than their work
to be sure they are few-not more than two hun-
dred at most-and the inhabitants have no fears
they assure me that the ants will soon be recaptur-
ed that in airships these beings can locate the
fugitives and either take or destroy them and that
even if such means fail the ants may be destroyed
by scattering the deadly compound about their
haunts and by preventing them from securing food

  moreover they point out the ants are few and
are no menace unless in vast numbers and that
long before they can increase enough to be danger-
ous they will again be under control

   but i cannot put aside my fears my premoni-
tions who can say where the ants have gone
who can say what their numbers may be for all
anyone knows they may have been increasing by
thousands beneath the earth may have been waiting
for months or years until they had reared a horde
of their kind in the dark unseen passages under-
ground and their strength activity and tireless-
ness are prodigious one of the great insects has
the strength of a score of men or the muscular
powers of several giant lobster-like beings and
they multiply with amazing rapidity even now
they may number countless thousands may be bid-
ing their time in some hidden subterranean lair
storing food making plans drilling only waiting
for the time when they will be ready and prepared
to overwhelm the country with their armies and
the strangest part of it is that such thoughts should
trouble me why should it matter to me whether
these lobster-like beings or the giant ants are in
supremacy why should i care what takes place in
this country in which i have no interest and which i
have grown to hate and detest it is not fear of
personal injuries or death but i shudder at the
thought of being made captive or being destroyed
by the ants for death i feel might prove bettor
than a life among these creatures i have tried to
analyze my feelings to fathom the cause of my
worries and though it sounds ridiculous though
even to me it seems impossible yet i feel sure that
it is due to a sense of patriotism

  patriotism for a land that is my prison for a
race of beings with whom i have nothing in com-
mon and yet it is so although i chafe at my
enforced life here although i long to be away from
the country and its denizens although their life
ways and personalities are all repugnant to me yet
such a strange thing is the human mind that i feel
as greatly concerned over the impending danger
as if these beings were of my own race and it
was my own country

  yes and if it comes to battle to a war between
the ants and these supercrustaceans i know in my
heart that i shall find myself battling against the
ants using my every effort to aid these monstrous
beings in overthrowing their hereditary enemies


amazing stories

   little did i dream when i wrote months ago
that even war would be welcome how soon my
words were to be borne out for war bloody merci-
less relentless and horrible beyond words to ex-
press is i feel sure near at hand

                    

   a month or more has passed since last i wrote
and during that interval events have moved rapidly
the ants have been discovered scouts have found
them and my worst fears have been more than ful-
filled in incalculable thousands they are swarm-
ing on a vast uninhabited area in the north drill-
ing gathering vast stores and evidently preparing
for a campaign and yet these beings are not dis-
turbed have no fears and have made little effort
to repel or destroy their enemies from airships
quantities of the death dealing chemicals were drop-
ped upon the ants but with little result a few
were killed but instantly the alarm was given the
ants vanished like magic seeking safe refuge in
subterranean burrows i have urged these crea-
tures to set forth and attack to take the offensive
against the ants to drop explosives from airships
and thus shatter the burrows and destroy the occu-
pants and i have sought to induce them to sur-
round themselves with barriers of the ant poison

 but my words have been unheeded so far so long
have these creatures lived in peace so long have
they been in complete control and so many years
have passed since they battled with the ants that
they have forgotten the terrible power and re-
sources of their enemies and underrate them too
late i fear will they awaken

   but i have not been idle with the aid of a few
who have given ear to my advice i have taken what
steps we can to protect the city we have laid
mines about it which can be exploded and in two
airships we have attempted to destroy the ants re-
treats with explosive but our puny efforts have
been of little avail moreover in our last assault
one of the airships was disabled by a premature
explosion and fell to earth and i shudder as i write
when i think of the awful scene i witnessed when
the ants rushed upon the occupants of the airship
and with ravenous jaws tore them in pieces while
still alive

   and if the ants are victorious that will be the
fate of all yes even of myself but i have no mind
to meet with such a fearful death i have provision-
ed my boat and if worst comes to worst i shall flee
in her across the water the ants cannot follow
and miles distant i know of a large island where i
shall seek safety-there to pass the remaining days
of my life alone

   a week since i wrote those last lines the ants
are advancing now already they have over-
whelmed two outlying towns and against them the
poison and even the explosives seem useless slow-
ly but inexorably they come making their way by
underground passages scurrying to safe retreats
far under the earth at first sight of an airship it
is teirible nightmarish this invisible silent ad-
vance of the vast hordes of terrible creatures and
the inhabitants are now terror stricken

   barriers of the poison have been passed by the
ants tunnelling beneath them hundreds of the in-
habitants of the countryside have fallen victims to
the relentless insects and each day their numbers

increase and they draw nearer to this metropolis

  they are within a few miles of the power plant
and at any moment may take possession of the sul-
phur mines and then the doom of the beings will
be sealed without resources without power all
will be helpless doomed to perish miserably or be-
come prisoners of the ants and there is no retreat
the insects have overrun the land have thrown out
great encircling armies and our scouts report them
on every side

  and now a new and more terrible thing has oc-
curred the ants are swarming their queens
winged and capable of flight are filling the air
darkening the skies and dropping here there every-
where to establish new colonies hundreds of them
have even dropped within the city and although they
have been destroyed yet their numbers seem un-
diminished unseen they drop at night hurrying
to hidden spots they deposit their eggs and ere
their presence is suspected the warriors have emerg-
ed and fall upon the surprised inhabitants and tear
them to bits in their extremity the creatures have
besought me to equip them with bows and arrows
guns anything in the form of weapons and these
have helped with their arrows with the bullets
from the crude firearms they have managed to
keep the ant army in check for these are things
new to the ants and they have no means of resisting
them desperate as our case is yet i have smiled
to think how history repeats itself how these be-
ings have been forced to resort to prehistoric prim-
itive means to preserve their homes and lives just
as the armies of europe despite modern weapons
high explosives poisonous gasses and every latest
scientific device were forced to resort to armor
grenades medieaval weapons and methods to com-
bat the germans

  and even the wagons the motor vehicles have
been brought into play against the ants for the
airships are next to useless let an airship rise
aloft and the swarming queen ants light upon it by
hundreds and bear it to earth with their weight
but the wheeled vehicles protected transformed
to miniature forts of metal and filled with armed
beings carry terror and destruction among the ants
crushing them beneath the wheels while arrows and
bullets strike them down

  but despite all i feel that we are losing that our
efforts have been made too late and that at any
moment the horde of insects will everwhelm the
power plant and we will be incapable of making
food of producing light of manufacturing any-
thing even of operating our vehicles long have i
foreseen this and in preparation for the calamity
i have had steam engines built but these are all too
few to serve all our wants would that these beings
had but given heed to my words long ago and then
all might have been well too long they waited
and then panic stricken turned to me begging me to
take charge beseeching me to save them the fate
of the country of the inhabitants depends upon me
but i feel that no human effoits nothing that these
beings under my directions can accomplish will do
more than delay the end

  -x-

  what i dreaded most has befallen the ants are
in possession of the power plant everything is at a
standstill only the barest necessities of life can be
beyond the pole



produced with the puny limited power of my
machines the ancient antiquated mechanisms dis-
carded ages ago by these beings but what now
when all their marvelous inventions have failed
them are proving their salvation their one hope

  and it is but a forlorn hope we are besieged
encompassed surrounded and each day the en-
circling cordon is drawing irresistibly nearer

  i fear even to wait longer to entrust this manu-
script to a bird if i wait it may be too late so
tomorrow i shall enclose it in a metal cylinder and
shall lash it to the leg of a great albatross i have
captured

  and i am ready to flee to take to my boat each
day each hour the inhabitants are deserting the
city they are taking to the water are reverting
to the habits of their long forgotten ancestors are
becoming crustaceans once more and forgetting
all their great works all their civilization all their
evolved mentalities are seeking the depths of the
lake and reverting to a submarine life perchance
ere the city falls all the beings will have forsaken

the life they have led for generations and in the
water and the slime beneath it will have found
safety and there will forget all and will degenerate
to the lobsters from which they rose tis a strange
a bizarre thought but man in time of dire ex-
tremity when overwhelmed and destroyed has
more than once reverted to savagery and every great
nation has fallen so perhaps tis but the law of
nature the working out of gods plan-

  i am about to close to seal my manuscript to
send it out to the world and i must make haste
scarcely a dozen of the inhabitants are left all
but these have deserted within the hour the ants
will overwhelm the city i must hurry to my boat
and escape ere it is too late

  yes even now they are coming they are in the
outskirts their hordes will cut off my retreat if
i do not close at once it is the end my narrative
must be sealed and entrusted to the albatross which
for many weeks i have held captive and awaiting
this time god grant that it may reach the hand of
some fellow man

chapter i

the world insane

in all his lifetime of perhaps twenty years it
had never occurred to burl to wonder what his
grandfather had thought about his surround-
ings the grandfather had come to an untimely
end in a rather unpleasant fashion which burl
remembered vaguely as a succession of screams
coming more and more faintly to his ears while he
was being carried away at the top speed of which
his mother was capable

  burl had rarely or never thought of the old
gentleman since surely he had never wondered
in the abstract of what his greatgrandfather
thought and most surely of all there never entered
his head such a purely hypothetical question as the
one of what his many-times-great-grandfather-
say of the year -would have thought of the
scene in which burl found himself

  he was treading cautiously over a brownish car-
pet of fungus growth creeping furtively toward
the stream which he knew by the generic title of
water it was the only water he knew toweir
ing far above his head three man-heights high
great toadstools hid the grayish sky from his sight
clinging to the foot-thick stalks of the toadstools
were still other fungi parasites upon the growths
that had once been parasites themselves

  burl himself was a slender young man wearing a
single garment twisted about his waist made from
the wing-fabric of a great moth the members of his
tribe had slain as it emerged from its cocoon his
skin was fair without a trace of sunburn in all
his lifetime he had never seen the sun though the
sky was rarely hidden from view save by the giant
fungi which with monster cabbages were the only
growing things he knew

clouds usually spread bagnio-
overhead and when they
did not the perpetual
haze made the sun but an
indefinitely brighter part
of the sky never a sharp-
ly edged ball of fire

fantastic mosses mis-
shapen fungus growths
colossal molds and yeasts
were the essential parts
of the landscape through
which he moved

  once as he had dodged
through the forest of huge
toadstools his shoulder
touched a cream-colored
stalk giving the whole

fungus a tiny shock instantly from the umbrella-
like mass of pulp overhead a fine and impalpable
powder fell upon him like snow it was the season
when the toadstools sent out their spores or seeds
and they had been dropped upon him at the first
sign of disturbance

  furtive as lie was he paused to brush them from
his head and hair they were deadly poison as he
knew well

  burl would have been a curious sight to a man
of the twentieth century his skin was pink like

 jt e recently published a charming tale by the author
 of this story entitled the runaway skyscraper
 great as zvas that story this one is even greater the pos-
 sibility that our planet will some day be dominated by the
 insect world has been admitted by our greatest entomolo-
 gists and the possibility of this is not half so remote as
 one might think

   some of our deepest thinkers believe that it is not only
 possible but most probable that this may happen or pos-
 sibly has happened in the past at any rote mr murray
 leinster gives us an insight into the life of our planet
 under the altered conditions

   it is a story tremendous in its possibilities and the au-
 thor has written it with such a facile pen that you can-
 not lay the story aside until you have come to its con-
 clusion

his body even that on top of his head was soft
and downy his chest was larger than his fore-
fathers had been and his ears seemed almost cap-
able of independent movement to catch threaten-
ing sounds from any direction his eyes large
and blue possessed pupils which could dilate to
extreme size allowing him to see in almost com-
plete darkness

  he was the result of the thirty thousand years
attempt of the human race to adapt itself to the
change that had begun in the latter half of the
twentieth century

  at about that time civilization had been high
and apparently secure mankind had reached a
permanent agreement within itself and all men
had equal opportunities to education and leisure
machinery did most of the labor of the world and
men were only required to supervise its operation
ah men were well-fed all men were well-educated
and it seemed that until the end of time the earth
would be the abode of a community of comfortable
human beings pursuing their studies and diver-
sions their illusions and their truths- peace
quietness privacy freedom were universal

  then just when men were congratulating them-
selves that the golden age had come again it wa
observed that the planet seemed ill at ease pis-
sures opened slowly in the crust and carbonic acid
gas-the carbon dioxide of chemists-began to
pour out into the atmosphere that gas had long
been known to be present in the air and was con-
sidered necessary to plant life most of the plants
of the world took the gas and absorbed its carbon
into themselves releasing the oxygen for use again

  scientists had calculated that a great deal of the
earths increased fertility was due to the larger
quantities of carbon dioxide released by the activi-
ties of man in burning
his coal and petroleum
because of those views
for some years no great
alarm was caused by the
continuous exhalation
from the worlds interior

  constantly however the
volume increased new
fissures constantly opened
each one adding a new
source of carbon dioxide
and each one pouring into
the already laden atmos-
phere more of the gas-
beneficent in small quanti-
ties butastheworld learn-
-	ed deadly in large ones

                         the percentage of the
heavy vapor-like gas increased the whole body of
the air became heavier through its admixture it
absorbed more moisture and became more humid
rainfall increased climates grew warmer vegeta-
tion became more luxuriant-but the air gradually
became less exhilarating

  soon the health of mankind began to be affected
accustomed through long ages to breath air rich in
oxygen and poor in carbon dioxide men suffered
only those who lived on high plateaus or on tall
mountain-tops remained unaffected the plants of

that of a child and there was but little hair upon the earth though nourished and increasing in size


amazing stories

beyond those ever seen before were unable to dispose
of the continually increasing flood of carbon dioxide
exhaled by the weary planet

  by the middle of the twenty-first century it was
generally recognized that a new carboniferous period
was about to come when the earths atmosphere
would be thick and humid unbreathable by man
when giant grasses and ferns would form the only
vegetation

  when the twenty-first century drew to a close
the whole human race began to revert to conditions
closely approximating savagery the lowlands were
unbearable thick jungles of rank growth covered
the ground the air was depressing and ennervat-
ing men could live there but it was a sickly fever-
ridden existence the whole population of tho
earth desired the high lands and as the low country
became more unbearable men forgot their two
centuries of peace

  they fought destructively each for a bit of land
where he might live and breathe then men began
to die men who had persisted in remaining near
sea-level they could not live in the poisonous air
the danger zone crept up as the earth-fissures tire-
lessly poured out their steady streams of foul gas
soon men could not live within five hundred feet
of sea-level the lowlands went uncultivated and
became jungles of a thickness comparable only to
those of the first carboniferous period

  then men died of sheer inanition at a thousand
feet the plateaus and mountain-tops were crowded
with folk struggling for a foothold and food beyond
the invisible menace that crept up and up-

  these things did not take place in one year or
in ten not in one generation but in several be-
tween the time when the chemists of the inter-
national geophysical institute announced that the
proportion of carbon dioxide in the air had increased
from  per cent to  per cent and the time when
at sea-level six per cent of the atmosphere was the
deadly gas more than two hundred years intervened

  coming gradually as it did the poisonous effects
of the deadly stuff increased with insidious slow-
ness first the lassitude then the heaviness of
brain then the weakness of body mankind ceased
to grow in numbers after a long period the race
had fallen to a fraction of its former size there
was room in plenty on the mountain-tops-but the
danger-level continued to creep up

  there was but one solution the human body
would have to inure itself to the poison or it was
doomed to extinction it finally developed a tolera-
tion for the gas that had wiped out race after race
and nation after nation but at a terrible cost
lungs increased in size to secure the oxygen on
which life depended but the poison inhaled at
every breath left the few survivors sickly and filled
with a perpetual weariness their minds lacked
the energy to cope with new problems or transmit
the knowledge they possessed

  and after thirty thousand years burl a direct
descendant of the first president of the universal
republic crept through a forest of toadstools and
fungus growths he was ignorant of fire of metals

of the uses of stone and wood a single garment
was worn by him his language was a scanty group
of a few hundred labial sounds conveying no ab-
stractions and few concrete ideas

  he was ignorant of the uses of wood there was
no wood in the scanty territory furtively inhabited
by his tribe with the increase in heat and humidity
the trees had begun to die out those of northern
climes went first the oaks the cedars the maples
then the pines-the beeches went early-the cypresses
and finally even the forests of the jungles vanished
only grasses and reeds bamboos and their kin were
able to flourish in the new steaming atmosphere
the thick jungles gave place to dense thickets of
grasses and ferns now become tree-ferns again

  and then the fungi took their place flourishing
as never before flourishing on a planet of torrid
heat and perpetual miasma on whose surface the
sun never shone directly because of an ever-thicken-
ing bank of clouds that hung sullenly overhead the
fungi sprang up about the dank pools that fest-
ered over the surface of the earth fungus growths
began to cluster of every imaginable shade and
color of all monstrous forms and malignant pur-
poses of huge size and flabby volume they spread
over the land

  the grasses and ferns gave place to them squat
toadstools flaking molds evil-smelling yeasts vast
mounds of fungi inextricably mingled as to species
but growing forever growing and exhaling an odor
of dark places

  the strange growths now grouped themselves in
forests horrible travesties on the vegetation they
had succeeded they grew and grew with feverish
intensity beneath a clouded or a haze-obscured sky
while above them fluttered gigantic butterflies and
huge moths sipping daintily of their corruption

  the insects alone of all the animal world above
water were able to endure the change they multi-
plied exceedingly and enlarged themselves in the
thickened air the solitary vegetation-as distinct
from fungus growths-that had survived was now
a degenerate form of the cabbages that had once
fed peasants on those rank colossal masses of
foliage the stolid grubs and caterpillars ate them-
selves to maturity then swung below in strong
cocoons to sleep the sleep of metamorphosis from
which they emerged to spread their wings and fly

  the tiniest butterflies of formerdayshad in-
creased their span until their gaily colored wings
should be described in terras of feet while the larger
emperor moths extended their purple sails to a
breadth of yards upon yards burl himself would
have been dwarfed beneath the overshadowing
fabric of their wings

  it was fortunate that they the largest flying
creatures were harmless or nearly so burls fel-
low tribesmen sometimes came upon a cocoon just
about to open and waited patiently beside it until
the beautiful creature within broke through its
matted shell and came out into the sunlight

  then before it had gathered energy from the air
and before its wings had swelled to strength and
firmness the tribesmen fell upon it tearing the
the mad puanet



filmy delicate wings from its body and the limbs
from its carcass then when it lay helpless before
them they carried away the juicy meat-filled limbs
to be eaten leaving the still living body to stare
helplessly at this strange world through its many-
faceted eyes and become a prey to the voracious
ants who would soon clamber upon it and carry it
away in tiny fragments to their underground city

  not all the insect world was so helpless or so
unthreatening burl knew of wasps almost the
length of his own body who possessed stings that
were instantly fatal to every species of wasp
however some other insect is predestined prey and
the furtive members of burls tribe feared them
but little as they sought only the prey to which
their instinct led them

  bees were similarly aloof they were hard put
to it for existence those bees few flowers bloomed
and they were reduced to expedients once considered
signs of degeneracy in their race they gathered
bubbling yeasts and fouler things occasionally from
the nectarless blooms of the rank giant cabbages
burl knew the bees they droned over nearly as
large as he was himself their bulging eyes gazing
at him with abstracted preoccupation and crickets
and beetles and spiders-

  burl knew spiders his grandfather had been
the prey of one of the hunting tarantulas which had
leaped with incredible ferocity from his excavated
tunnel in the earth a vertical pit in the ground two
feet in diameter went down for twenty feet at
the bottom of that lair the black-bellied monster
waited for the tiny sounds that would warn him of
prey approaching his hiding-place lycosa fas-
data

  burls grandfather had been careless and the
terrible shrieks he uttered as the horrible monster
darted from the pit and seized him had lingered
vaguely in burls mind ever since burl tiad seen
too the monster webs of another species of spider
and watched from a safe distance as the misshapen
body of the huge creature sucked the juices from
a three-foot cricket that had become entangled in
its trap

  burl had remembered the strange stripes of
yellow and black and silver that crossed upon its
abdomen eyiera fasciata he had been fas-
cinated by the struggles of the imprisoned insect
coiled in a hopeless tangle of sticky gummy ropes
the thickness of burls finger cast about its body
before the spider made any attempt to approach

  burl knew these dangers they were a part of
his life it was his accustomedness to them and
that of his ancestors that made his existence pos-
sible he was able to evade them so he survived
a moment of carelessness an instants relaxation
of his habitual caution and he would be one with
his forebears forgotten meals of long-dead inhuman
monsters

  three days before burl had crouched behind a
bulky shapeless fungus growth while he watched
a furious duel between two huge horned beetles
their jaws gaping wide clicked and clashed upon
each others impenetrable armor their legs

crashed like so many cymbals as their polished sur-
faces ground and struck against each other they
were fighting over some particularly attractive bit
of carrion

  burl had watched with all his eyes until a gaping
orifice appeared in the armor of the smaller of the
two it uttered a shrill cry or seemed to cry out
the noise was actually the tearing of the horny
stuff beneath the victorious jaws of the adversary
the wounded beetle struggled more and more
feebly at last it collapsed and the conqueror
placidly began to eat the conquered before life was
extinct

  burl waited until the meal was finished and then
approached the scene with caution an ant-the
forerunner of many-was already inspecting the
carcass

  burl usually ignored the ants they were stupid
short-sighted insects and not hunters save when
attacked they offered no injury they were scaven-
gers on the look-out for the dead and dying but
they would fight viciously if their prey were ques-
tioned and they were dangerous opponents they
were from three inches in length for the tiny black
ants to a foot for the large termites

  burl was hasty when he heard the tiny clickings
of their limbs as they approached he seized the
sharp-pointed snout of the victim detached from
the body and fled from the scene

  later he inspected his find with curiosity the
smaller victim had been a minotaur beetle with a
sharp-pointed horn like that of a rhinoceros to re-
inforce his offensive armament already dangerous
because of his wide jaws the jaws of a beetle
work from side to side instead of up and down
and this had made the protection complete in no
less than three directions

  burl inspected the sharp danger-like instrument
in his hand he felt its point and it pricked his
finger he flung it aside as he crept to the hiding-
place of his tribe there were only twenty of them
four or five men six or seven women and the rest
girls and children

    burl had been wondering at the strange feel-
ings that came over him when he looked at one of
the girls she was younger than burl-perhaps
eighteen-and fleeter of foot than he they talked
together sometimes and once or twice burl shared
with her an especially succulent find of foodstuffs

  the next mprning he found the horn where he
had thrown it sticking in the flabby side of a toad-
stool he pulled it out and gradually far back in
his mind an idea began to take shape he sat for
some time with the thing in his hand considering it
with a far-away look in his eyes from time to
time he stabbed at a toadstool awkwardly but with
gathering skill his imagination began to work
fitfully he visualized himself stabbing food with
it as the larger beetle had stabbed the former owner
of the weapon in his hand

  burl could not imagine himself coping with one
of the fighting insects he could only picture him-
self dimly stabbing something that was food with
this death-dealing thing it was longer than his

arm and though clumsy to the hand an effective and
terribly sharp implement

  he thought where was there food food that
lived that would not fight back presently he
rose and began to make his way toward the tiny
river ydlow-bellied newts swam in its waters
the swimming larvze of a thousand insects floated
about its surface or crawled upon its bottom

  there were deadly things there too giant
crayfish snapped their horny claws at the unwary
mosquitoes of four-inch wing-spread sometimes
made their humming way above the river the last
survivors of their race they were dying out for
lack of the plant-juices on which the male of the
species lived but even so they were formidable
burl had learned to crush them with fragments of
fungus

  he crept slowly through the forest of toadstools
brownish fungus was underfoot strange orange
red and purple molds clustered about the bases
of the creamy toadstool stalks once burl paused
to run his sharp-pointed weapon through a fleshy
stalk and reassure himself that what he planned was
practicable

  he made his way furtively through the forest of
misshapen growths once he heard a tiny clicking
and froze into stillness it was a troop of four or
five ants each some eight inches long returning
along their habitual pathway to their city they
moved sturdily heavily laden along the route
marked with the odorous formic acid exuded from
the bodies of their comrades burl waited until
they had passed then went on

  he came to the bank of the river green scum
covered a great deal of its surface scum occasionally
broken by a slowly enlarging bubble of some gas
released from decomposing matter on the bottom
in the center of the placid stream the current ran
a little more swiftly and the water itself was visible

  over the shining current water-spiders ran swift-
ly they had not shared in the general increase
of size that had taken place in the insect world
depending upon the capillary qualities of the water
to support them an increase in size and weight
would have deprived them of the means of locomo-
tion

  from the spot where burl first peered at the
water the green scum spread out for many yards
into the stream he could not see what swam and
wriggled and crawled beneath the evil-smelling
covering he peered up and down the banks

  perhaps a hundred and fifty yards below the
current came near the shore an out-cropping of
rock there made a steep descent to the river from
which yellow shelf-fungi stretched out dark-red
and orange above they were light-yellow below and
they formed a series of platforms above the
smoothly flowing stream burl made his way
cautiously toward them

  on his way he saw one of the edible mushrooms
that formed so large a part of his diet and paused
to break from the flabby flesh an amount that would
feed him for many days it ws too often the cus-
tom of his people to find a store of food carry it to

their hiding-place and then gorge themselves for
days eating sleeping and waking only to eat again
until the food was gone

  absorbed as he was in his plan of trying his new
weapon burl was tempted to return with his booty
he would give saya of this food and they would
eat together saya was the maiden who roused un-
usual emotions in burl he felt strange impulses
stirring within him when she was near a desire to
touch her to caress her he did not understand

  he went on after hesitating if he brought her
food saya would be pleased but if he brought her
of the things that swam in the stream she would
be still more pleased degraded as his tribe had
become burl was yet a little more intelligent than
they he was an atavism a throwback to ancestors
who had cultivated the earth and subjugated its
animals he had a vague idea of pride unformed
but potent

  no man within memory had hunted or slain for
food they knew of meat yes but it had been the
fragments left by an insect-hunter seized and
carried away by the men before the perpetually alert
ant-colonies had sent their foragers to the scene

  if burl did what no man before him had done
if he brought a whole carcass to his tribe they
would envy him they were preoccupied solely
with their stomachs and after that with the pre-
servation of their lives the perpetuation of the
race came third in their consideration

  they were herded together in a leaderless group
coming to the same hiding-place that they might
share in the finds of the lucky and gather comfort
from their numbers of weapons they had none
they sometimes used stones to crack open the
limbs of the huge insects they found partly de-
voured cracking them open for the sweet meat to
be found inside but they sought safety from their
enemies solely in flight and hiding

  their enemies were not as numerous as might
have been imagined most of the meat-eating in-
sects have their allotted prey the sphex-a hunt-
ing wasp-feeds solely upon grasshoppers other
wasps eat fires only the pirate-bee eats bumble-
bees only spiders were the principal enemies of
man as they devour with a terrifying impartiality
all that falls into their clutches

  burl reached the spot from which he might gaze
down into the water he lay prostrate staring into
the shallow depths once a huge crayfish as long
as burls body moved leisurely across his vision
small fishes and even the huge newts fled before
the voracious creature

  after a long time the tide of underwater life
resumed its activity the wriggling grubs of the
dragon-flies reappeared little flecks of silver swam
into view-a school of tiny fish a larger fish ap-
peared moving slowly through the water

  burls eyes glistened and his mouth watered
he reached down with his long weapon it barely
touched the water disappointment filled him yet
the nearness and the apparent practicability of his
scheme spurred him on

  he considered the situation there were the
shelf-fungi below him he rose and moved to a
the mad planet



point just above them then thrust his spear down
they resisted its point burl felt them tentatively
with his foot then dared to thrust his weight to
them they held him firmly he clambered down
and lay flat upon them peering over the edge as
before

  the large fish as long as burls arm swam slowly
to and fro below him burl had seen the former
owner of his spear strive to thrust it into his op-
ponents and knew that a thrust was necessary
he had tried his weapon upon toadstools-had prac-
tised with it when the fish swam below him he
thrust sharply downward the spear seemed to
bend when it entered the water and missed its
mark by inches to burls astonishment he tried
again and again

  he grew angry with the fish below him for elud-
ing his efforts to kill it repeated strokes had left
it untouched and it was unwary and did not even
try to run away

  burl became furious the big fish came to rest
directly beneath his hand burl thrust downward
with all his strength this time the spear enter-
ing vertically did not seem to bend it went
straight down its point penetrated the scales of
the swimmer below transfixing that lazy fish com-
pletely

  an uproar began the fish struggling to escape
and burl trying to draw it up to his perch made
a huge commotion in his excitement burl did not
observe a tiny ripple some distance away the
monster crayfish was attracted by the disturbance
and was approaching

  the unequal combat continued burl hung on
desperately to the end of his spear then there was
a tremor in burls support it gave way and fell
into the stream with a mighty splash burl went
under his eyes open facing death and as he
sank his wide-open eyes saw waved before him the
gaping claws of the huge crayfish large enough to
sever a limb with a single stroke of their jagged
jaws

chapter ii

the black-bellied spider

he opened his mouth to scream a replica of
the terrible screams of his grandfather
seized by a black-bellied tarantula years
before but no sound came forth only bubbles
floated to the surface of the water he beat the
unresisting fluid with his hands-he did not know
how to swim the colossal creature approached
leisurely while burl struggled helplessly

  his arms struck a solid object and grasped it
convulsively a second later he had swung it be-
tween himself and thc huge crustacean he felt
a shock as the mighty jaws closed upon the cork-
like fungus then felt himself drawn upward as the
crayfish released his hold and the shelf-fungus float-
ed to the surface having given way beneath him
it had been carried below him in his fall only to
rise within his reach just when most needed

  burls head popped above water and he saw a
larger bit of the fungus floating near by less se-
curely anchored to the rocks of the river-bank than
the shelf to which burl had trusted himself it had
been dislodged when the first shelf gave away it

was larger than the fragment to which burl clung
and floated higher in the water

  burl was cool with a terrible self possession he
seized it and struggled to draw himself on top of
it it tilted as his weight came upon it and nearly
overturned but he paid no heed with desperate
haste he clawed with hands and feet until he could
draw himself clear of the water of which he would
forever retain a slight fear

  as he pulled himself upon the furry orange-
brown upper surface a sharp blow struck his foot
the crayfish disgusted at finding only what was
to it a tasteless morsel in the shelf-fungus had
made a languid stroke at burls wriggling foot in
the water failing to grasp the fleshy member the
crayfish retreated disgruntled and annoyed

  and burl floated down-stream perched weapon-
less and alone frightened and in constant danger
upon a flimsy raft composed of a degenerate fungus
floating slowly down the stream of a river in whose
waters death lurked unseen upon whose banks was
peril and above whose reaches danger fluttered on
golden wings

  it was a long time before he recovered his
self-possession and when he did he looked first for
his spear it was floating in the water still trans-
fixing the fish whose capture had endangered burls
life the fish now floated with its belly upward all
life gone

  so insistent was burls instinct for food that his
predicament was forgotten when he saw his prey
just out of his reach he gazed at it and his
mouth watered while his cranky craft went down-
stream spinning slowly in the current he lay
flat on the floating fungoid and strove to reach
out and grasp the end of the spear

  the raft tilted and nearly flung him overboard
again a little later he discovered that it sank
more readily  one side than on the other that
was due of course to the greater thickness-and
consequently greater buoyancy-of the part which
had grown next the rocks of the river-bank

  burl found that if he lay with his head stretch-
ing above that side it did not sink into the water
he wriggled into this new position then and waited
until the slow revolution of his vessel brought the
spear-shaft near him he stretched his fingers
and his arm and touched then grasped it

  a moment later he was tearing strips of flesh
from the side of the fish and cramming the oily
mess into his mouth with great enjoyment he
had lost his edible mushroom that danced upon
the waves several yards away but burl ate con-
tentedly of what he possessed he did not worry
about what was before him that lay in the future
but suddenly he realized that he was being carried
farther and farther from saya the maiden of his
tribe who caused strange bliss to steal over him
when he contemplated her

  the thought came to him when he visualized the
delight with which she would receive a gift of part
of the fish he had caught he was suddenly stricken
with dumb sorrow he lifted his head and looked
longingly at the river banks

  a long monotonous row of strangely colored
fungus growths no healthy green but pallid
cream-colored toadstools some bright orange
lavender and purple molds vivid carmine rusts


amazing stories

and mildews spreading up the banks from the
turgid slime the sun was not a ball of fire but
merely shone as a bright golden patch in the haze-
filled sky a patch whose limits could not be defined
or marked

  in the faintly pinkish light that filtered down
through the air a multitude of flying objects could
be seen now and then a cricket or a grasshopper
made its bullet-like flight from one spot to another
huge butterflies fluttered gayly above the silent
seemingly lifeless world bees lumbered anxiously
about seeking the cross-shaped flowers of the
monster cabbages now and then a slender-waisted
yellow-stomached wasp flew alertly through the air

  burl watched them with a strange indifference
the wasps were as long as himself the bees on
end could match his height the butterflies ranged
from tiny creatures barely capable of shading his
face to colossal things in the folds of whose wings
he could have been lost and above him fluttered
dragon-flies whose long spindle-like bodies were
three times the length of his own

  burl ignored them all sitting there an incon-
gruous creature of pink skin and soft brown hair
upon an orange fungus floating in midstream he
was filled with despondency because the current
carried him forever farther and farther from a
certain slender-limbed maiden of his tiny tribe
whose glances caused an odd commotion in his
breast

  the day went on once burl saw upon the
blue-green mold that there spread upward from the
river a band of large red amazon ants marching
in orderly array to raid the city of a colony of
black ants and carry away the eggs they would
fhid there the eggs would be hatched and the
small black creatures made the slaves of the bri-
gands who had stolen them

  the amazon ants can live only by the labor of
their slaves and for that reason are mighty war-
riors in their world later etched against the
steaming mist that overhung everything as far as
the eye could reach burl saw strangely shaped
swollen branches rearing themselves from the
ground he knew what they were a hard-rinded
fungus that grew upon itself in peculiar mockery
of the vegetation that had vanished from the earth

  and again he saw pear-shaped objects above
some of which floated little clouds of smoke they
too were fungus growths puffballs which when
touched emit what seems a puff of vapor these
would have towered above burls head had he stood
beside them

  and then as the day drew to an end he saw
in the distance what seemed a range of purple hills
they were tall hills to burl some sixty or seventy
feet high and they seemed to be the agglomeration
of a formless growth multiplying its organisms
and forms upon itself until the whole formed an
irregular cone-shaped mound burl watched them
apathetically

  presently he ate again of the oily fish the
taste was pleasant to him accustomed to feed
mostly upon insipid mushrooms he stuffed him-
self though the size of his prey left by far the
larger part still un-eaten

  he still held his spear firmly beside him it had
brought him into trouble but burl possessed 

fund of obstinacy unlike most of his tribe he
associated the spear with the food it had secured
rather than with the difficulty into which it had led
him when he had eaten his fill he picked it up
and examined it again the sharpness of its point
was unimpaired

   burl handled it meditatively debating whether
 or not to attempt to fish again the shakiness of
 his little raft dissuaded him and he abandoned the
 idea presently he stripped a sinew from the gar-
 ment about his middle and hung the fish about his
 neck with it that would leave him both hands
 free then he sat cross-legged upon the soggily
 floating fungus like a pink-skinned buddha and
 watched the shores go by

   time had passed and it was drawing near sun-
 set burl never having seen the sun save as a
 bright spot in the overhanging haze did not think
 of the coming of night as sunset to him it was
 the letting down of darkness from the sky

   to-day happened to be an exceptionally bright
 day and the haze was not as thick as usual far
 to the west the thick mist turned to gold while
  the thicker clouds above became blurred masses of
 dull-red their shadows seemed like lavender from
 the contrast of shades upon the still surface of the
 river all the myriad tints and shadings were re-
 flected with an incredible faithfulness and the
 shining tops of the giant mushrooms by the river
 brim glowed faintly pink

   dragonflies buzzed over his head in their swift
 and angular flight the metallic luster of their bodies
 glistening in the rosy light great yellow butter-
 flies flew lightly above the stream here there and
 everywhere upon the water appeared the shell-
 formed boats of a thousand caddis flies floating
 upon the surface while they might

   burl could have thrust his hand down into their
 cavities and seized the white worms that inhabited
 the strange craft the huge bulk of a tardy bee
 droned heavily overhead burl glanced upward
 and saw the long proboscis and the hairy hinder
 legs with their scanty load of pollen he saw the
 great multiple-lensed eyes with their expression of
 stupid preoccupation and even the sting that would
 mean death alike for him and for the giant insect
 should it be used

   the crimson radiance grew dim at the edge of
 the world the purple hills had long been left be-
 hind now the slender stalks of ten thousand
 round-domed mushrooms lined the river-bank and
 beneath them spread fungi of all colors from the
 rawest red to palest blue but all now fading slowly
 to a monochromatic background in the growing
 dusk

   the buzzing fluttering and the flapping of the
 insects of the day died slowly down while from
 a million hiding-places there crept out into the
 deep night soft and furry bodies of great moths
 who preened themselves and smoothed their feathery
 antenna before taking to the air the strong-
 limbed crickets set up their thunderous noise-
 grown gravely bass with the increasing size of the
 organs by which the sound was made-and then
 there began to gather on the water those slender
 spirals of tenuous mist that would presently blanket
 the stream in a mantle of thin fog

   night fell the clouds above seemed to lower and
the mad planet



 grow dark gradually now a drop and then a drop
 the languid fall of large warm raindrops that would
 drip from the moisture-laden skies all through the
 night began the edge of the stream became a
 place where great disks of coolly glowing flame
 appeared

  the mushrooms that bordered on the river were
faintly phosphoiescent pleurotus phosphor eus
and shone coldly upon the rusts and flake-fungi
beneath their feet here and there a ball of lam-
bent flame appeared drifting idly above the steam-
ing festering earth

  thirty thousand years before men had called
them will-o-the-wisps but burl simply stared at
them accepting them as he accepted all that passed
only a man attempting to advance in the scale of
civilization tries to explain everything that he sees
the savage and the child are most often content
to observe without comment unless the legends
told by wise folk who are possesed by the itch of
knowledge are repeated to them

  burl watched for a long time great fireflies
whose beacons lighted up their surroundings for
many yards-fireflies burl knew to be as long as his
spear-great fireflies shed their intermittent glows
upon the stream softly fluttering wings in great
beats that poured torrents of air upon him passed
above burl

  the air was full of winged creatures the night
was broken by their cries by the sound of their
invisible wings by their cries of anguish and their
mating calls above him and on all sides the per-
sistent intense life of the insect world went on
ceaselessly but burl rocked back and forth upon
his frail mushroom boat and wished to weep be-
cause he was being carried from his tribe and from
saya-saya of the swift feet and white teeth of
the shy smile

  burl may have been homesick but his principal
thoughts were of saya he had dared greatly to
bring a gift of fresh meat to her meat captured
as meat had never been known to be taken by a
member of the tribe and now he was being carried
from her

  he lay disconsolate upon his floating atom on
the water for a great part of the night it was long
after midnight when the mushroom raft struck
gently and remained grounded upon a shallow in
the stream

  when the light came in the morning burl gazed
about him keenly he was some twenty yards from
the shore and the greenish scum surrounded his
now disintegrating vessel the river had widened
out until the other bank was barely to be seen
through the haze above the surface of the river but
the nearer shore seemed firm and no more full of
dangers than the territory his tribe inhabited he
felt the depth of the water with his spear then was
struck with the multiple usefulness of that weapon
the water would come but slightly above his ankles

  shivering a little with fear burl stepped down
into the water then made for the bank at the top
of his speed he felt a soft something clinging to
one of his bare feet with an access of terror he
ran faster and stumbled upon the shore in a panic
he stared down at his foot a shapeless flesh-
colored pad clung to his heel and as burl watched

it began to swell slowly while the pink of its
wrinkled folds deepened

  it was no more than a leech sharing in the en-
largement nearly all the lower world had under-
gone but burl did not know that he thrust at it
with the side of his spear then scraped frantically
at it and it fell off leaving a blotch of blood upon
the skin where it came away it lay writhing and
pulsating upon the ground and burl fled from it

  he found himself in one of the toadstool forests
with which he was familiar and finally paused
disconsolately he knew the nature of the fungus
growth about him and presently fell to eating in
burl the sight of food always produced hunger-a
wise provision of nature to make up for the in-
stinct to store food which he lacked

  burls heart was small within him he was far
from his tribe and far from saya in the par-
lance of this day it is probable that no more than
forty miles separated them but burl did not think
of distances he had come down the river he was
in a land he had never known or seen and he was
alone

  all about him was food all the mushrooms that
surrounded him were edible and formed a store of
sustenance burls whole tribe could not have eaten
in many days but that very fact brought saya to
his mind more forcibly pie squatted on the ground
wolfing down the insipid mushroom in great gulps
when an idea suddenly came to him with all the
force of inspiration

  he would bring saya here where there was food
food in great quantities and she would be pleased
burl had forgotten the large and oily fish that still
hung down his back from the sinew about his neck
but now he rose and its flapping against him re-
minded him again

  he took and fingered it all over getting his hands
and himself thoroughly greasy in the process but
he could eat no more the thought of sayas pleas-
ure at the sight of that too reinforced his deter-
mination

  with all the immediacy of a child or a savage he
set off at once lie had come along the bank of the
stream he would retrace his steps along the bank
of the stream

  through the awkward aisles of the mushroom
forest he made his way eyes and ears open for
possibilities of danger several times he heard the
omnipresent clicking of ants on their multifarious
businesses in the wood but he could afford to
ignore them they were foragers rather than hun-
ters he only feared one land of ant the army-ant
which sometimes travels in hordes of millions eat-
ing all that it comes upon in ages past when they
were tiny creatures not an inch long even the
largest animals fled from them now that they
measured a foot in length not even the gorged
spiders whose distended bellies were a yard in
thickness dared offer them battle

  the mushroom-forest came to an end a cheerful
grasshopper ephigger munched delicately at some
dainty it had found its hind legs were bunched
beneath it in perpetual readiness for flight a
monster wasp appeared above-as long as burl him-
self-poised aii instant dropped and seized the
luckless feaster

  there was a struggle then the grasshopper be-


amazing stories

came helpless and the wasps flexible abdomen
curved delicately its sting entered the jointed ar-
mor of its prey just beneath the head the sting
entered with all the deliberate precision of a sur-
geons scalpel and all struggle ceased

  the wasp grasped the palalyzed not dead insect
and flew away burl grunted and passed on he
had hidden when the wasp darted down from above

  the ground grew rough and burls progress be-
came painful he clambered arduously up steep
slopes and made his way cautiously down their
farther sides once he had to climb through a
tangled mass of mushrooms so closely placed and so
small that he had to break them apart with blows
of his spear before he could pass when they shed
upon him torrents of a fiery-red liquid that rolled
off his greasy breast and sank into the ground
lactarius deliciosus

  a strange self-confidence now took possession of
burl he walked less cautiously and more boldly
the mere fact that he had struck something and
destroyed it provided him with a curious fictitious
courage

  he had climbed slowly to the top of a red-clay
cliff perhaps a hundred feet high slowly eaten
away by the river when it overflowed burl could
see the river at some past flood-time it had lapped
at the base of the cliff on whose edge he walked
though now it came no nearer than a quarter-mile

  the cliffside was almost covered with shelf-fungi
large and small white yellow orange and green in
indescribable confusion and luxuriance from a
point halfway up the cliff the inch-thick cable of a
spiders web stretched down to an anchorage on
the ground and the strangely geometrical pattern
of the web glistened evilly

  somewhere among the fungi of the cliffside the
huge creature waited until some unfortunate prey
should struggle helplessly in its monster snare the
spider waited in a motionless implacable patience
invincibly certain of prey utterly merciless to its
victims

  burl strutted on the edge of the cliff a silly little
pink-skinned creature with an oily fish slung about
his neck and a draggled fragment of a moths wing
about his middle in his hand he bore the long spear
of a minotaur beetle he strutted and looked
scornfully down upon the whitely shining trap be-
low him he struck mushrooms and they had
fallen before him he feared nothing he strode
fearlessly along he would go to saya and bring
her to this land where food grew in abundance

  sixty paces before him a shaft sank vertically
in the sandy clayey soil it was a carefully rounded
shaft and lined with silk it went down for per-
haps thirty feet or more and there enlarged itself
into a chamber where the owner and digger of the
shaft might rest the top of the hole was closed
by a trap-door stained with mud and earth to
imitate with precision the surrounding soil a
keen eye would have been needed to perceive the
opening but a keen eye now peered out from a
tiny crack the eye of the engineer of the under-
ground dwelling

  eight hairy legs surrounded the body of the
creature that hung motionless at the top of the silk-
lined shaft a huge misshapen globe formed its
body colored a dirty brown two pairb of ferocious

mandibles stretched before its fierce mouth parts
two eyes glittered evilly in the darkness of the bur-
row and over the whole body spread a rough
mangy fur

  it was a thing of implacable malignance of in-
credible ferocity it was the brown hunting-spider
the american tarantula mygale hentzii its
body was two feet and more in diameter and its
legs outstretched would cover a circle three yards
across it watched burl its eyes glistening slaver
welled up and dropped from its jaws

  and burl strutted forward on the edge of the cliff
puffed up with a sense of his own importance the
white snare of the spinning spider below him im-
pressed him as amusing he knew the spider would
not leave its web to attack him he reached down
and broke off a bit of fungus growing at his feet
where he broke it it was oozing a soupy liquid
and was full of tiny maggots in a delirium of feast-
ing burl flung it down into the web and then
laughed as the black bulk of the hidden spider
swung down from its hiding-place to investigate

  the tarantula peering from its burrow quivered
with impatience burl drew near and nearer he
was using his spear as a lever now and prying off
bits of fungus to fall down the cliffside into the
colossal web the spider below went leisurely from
one place to another investigating each new missile
with its palpi then leaving them as they appeared
lifeless and undesirable prey burl laughed again
as a particularly large lump of shelf-fungus nar-
rowly missed the black-and-silver figure below
then-

  the trap-door fell into place with a faint click and
burl whirled about his laughter turned to a
scream moving toward him with incredible rapid-
ity the monster tarantula opened its dripping jaws
its mandibles gaped wide the poison fangs were
unsheathed the creature was thirty paces away
twenty paces-ten it leaped into the air eyes
glittering all its eight legs extended to seize fangs
bared-

  burl screamed again and thrust out his arms to
ward off the impact of the leap in his terror his
grasp upon his spear had become agonized the
spear-point shot out and the tarantula fell upon it
nearly a quarter of the spear entered the body of
the ferocious thing

  it stuck upon the spear writhing horribly still
struggling to reach burl who was transfixed with
horror the mandibles clashed strange sounds
came from the beast then one of the attenuated
hairy legs rasped across burls forearm he gasped
in ultimate fear and stepped backward-and the
edge of the cliff gave way beneath him

  he hurtled downward still clutching the spear
which held the writhing creature from him down
through space his eyes glassy with panic the two
creatures-the man and the giant tarantula-fell
together there was a strangely elastic crash and
crackling they had fallen into the web beneath
them

  burl had reached the end of terror he could be
no more fear-struck struggling madly in the
gummy coils of an immense web which ever bound
him more tightly with a wounded creature shud-
dering in agony not a yard from him-yet a
wounded creature that still strove to reach him with
the mad planet



 its poison fangs-burl had reached the limit of
 panic

   he fought like a madman to break the coils about
 him his arms and breast were greasy from the
 oily fish and the-sticlcy web did not adhere to them
 but his legs and body were inextricably fastened by
 the elastic threads spread for just such prey as he

   he paused a moment in exhaustion then he
 saw five yards away the silvery and black monster
 waiting patiently for him to weary himself it
 judged the moment propitious the tarantula and
 the man were one in its eyes one struggling thing
 that had fallen opportunely into its snare they
 were moving but feebly now the spider advanced
 delicately swinging its huge bulk nimbly along the
 web paying out a cable after it as it came

   burls arms were free because of the greasy coat-
 ing they had received he waved them wildly
 shrieking at the pitiless monster that approached
 the spider paused those moving arms suggested
 mandibles that might wound or slap

   spiders take few hazards this spider was no
 exception to the rule it drew cautiously near then
 stopped its spinnerets became busy and with one
 of its eight legs used like an arm it flung a gummy
 silk impartially over both the tarantula and the
 man

   burl fought against the descending shroud he
 strove to thrust it away but in vain in a matter
 of minutes he was completely covered in a silken
 cloth that hid even the light from his eyes he
 and his enemy the giant tarantula were beneath
 the same covering though the tarantula moved but
 weakly

   the shower ceased the wed-spider had decided
 that they were helpless then burl felt the cables
 of the web give slightly as the spider approached to
 sting and suck the sweet juices from its prey

chapter iii

the army ants

 the web yielded gently as the added weight
 of the black-bellied spider approached burl
 froze into stillness under his enveloping cov-
 ering beneath the same silken shroud the taran-
 tula writhed in agony upon the point of burls spear
 it clashed its jaws shuddering upon the horny
 barb

   burl was quiet in an ecstasy of terror he waited
 for the poison-fangs to be thrust into him he
 knew the process pie had seen the leisurely fashion
 in which the giant spiders delicately stung their
 prey then withdrew to wait without impatience for
 the poison to do its work

   when their victim had ceased to struggle they
 drew near again and sucked the sweet juices from
 the body first from one point and then another
 until what had so recently been a creature vibrant
 with life became a shrunken withered husk-to be
 flung from the web at nightfall most spiders are
 tidy housekeepers destroying their snares daily to
  spin anew

 i the bloated evil creature moved meditatively
 i about the shining sheet of silk it had cast over the
  man and the giant tarantula when they fell from
  the cliff above now only the tarantula moved
  feebly its body was outlined by a bulge in the

concealing shroud throbbing faintly as it still strug-
gled with the spear in its vitals the irregularly
rounded protuberance offered a point of attack for
the web-spider it moved quickly forward and
stung

 galvanized into fresh torment by his new
agony the tarantula writhed in a very hell of pain
its legs clustered about the spear still fastened into
its body struck out purposelessly in horrible ges-
tures of delirious suffering burl screamed as one
of them touched him and struggled himself

  his arms and head were free beneath the silken
sheet because of the grease and oil that coated them
he clutched at the threads about him and strove to
draw himself away from his deadly neighbor the
threads did not break but they parted one from
another and a tiny opening appeared one of the
tarantulas attenuated limbs touched him again
with the strength of utter panic he hauled himself
away and the opening enlarged another struggle
and burls head emerged into the open air and he
stared down for twenty feet upon an open space al-
most carpeted with the chitinous remains of his
present captors former victims

  burls head was free and his breast and arms
the fish slung over his shoulder had shed its oil
upon him impartially but the lower part of his
body was held firm by the gummy snare of the web-
spider a snare far more tenacious than any bird-
lime ever manufactured by man

  he hung in his tiny window for a moment de-
spairing then he saw at a little distance the
bulk of the monster spider waiting patiently for
its poison to take effect and the struggling of its
prey to be stilled the tarantula was no more than
shuddering now soon it would be still and the
black-bellied creature waiting on the web would
approach for its meal

  burl withdrew his head and thrust desperately at
the sticky stuff about his loins and legs the oil
upon his hands kept it from clinging to them and
it gave a little in a flash of inspiration burl
understood he reached over his shoulder and
grasped the greasy fish tore it in a dozen places
and smeared himself with the now rancid exuda-
tion pushing the sticky threads from his limbs and
oiling the surface from which he had thrust it
away

  he felt the web tremble to the spider its poi-
son seemed to have failed of effect another sting
seemed to be necessary this time it would not in-
sert its fangs into the quiescent tarantula but
would sting where the disturbance was manifest-
would send its deadly venom into burl

  he gasped and drew himself toward his window
it was as if he would have pulled his legs from his
body his head emerged his shoulders half his
body was out of the hole

  the colossal spider surveyed him and made ready
to cast more of its silken sheet upon him the
spinnerets became active and the sticky stuff about
burls feet gave way he shot out of the open-
ing and fell sprawling awkwardly and heavily upon
the earth below crashing upon the shrunken shell
of a flying beetle which had fallen into the snare
and had not escaped as he had

  burl rolled over and over and then sat up an
angry foot-long ant stood before him its mandi-


amazing stories

bles extended threateningly while its antennas
waved wildly in the air a shrill stridulation filled
the air

  in ages past when ants were tiny creatures of
lengths to be measured in fractions of an inch
learned scientists debated gravely if their tribe
possessed a cry they believed that certain grooves
upon the body of the insects after the fashion of
those upon the great legs of the cricket might
offer the means of uttering an infinitely high-
pitched sound too shrill for mans ears to catch

  burl knew that the stridulation was caused by
the doubtful insect before him though he had never
wondered how it was produced the cry was used
to summon others of its city to help it in its diffi-
culty or good fortune

  clickings sounded fifty or sixty feet away com-
rades were coming to aid the pioneer harmless
save when interfered with-all save the army ant
that is-the whole ant tribe was formidable when
aroused utterly fearless they could pull down a
man and slay him as so many infuriated fox terriers
might have done thirty thousand years before

  burl fled without debate and nearly collided
with one of the anchoring cables of the web from
which he had barely escaped a moment before he
heard the shrill sound behind him suddenly sub-
side the ant short-sighted as all ants were no
longer felt itself threatened and went peacefully
about the business burl had interrupted that of
finding among the grewsome relics beneath the
spiders web some edible carrion which might feed
the inhabitants of its city

 burl sped on for a few hundred yards and
stopped it behooved him to move carefully he
was in strange territory and as even the most
familiar territory was full of sudden and implacable
dangers unknown lands were doubly or trebly
perilous

  burl too found difficulty in moving the glut-
inous stuff from the spiders shroud of silk still
stuck to his feet and picked up small objects as he
went along old ant-gnawed fragments of insect
armour pricked him even through his toughened
soles

  he looked about cautiously and removed them
took a dozen steps and had to stop again burls
brain had been uncommonly stimulated of late it
had gotten him into at least one predicament-due
to his invention of a spear-but had no less readily
led to his escape from another but for the reason-
ing that had led him to use the grease from the
fish upon his shoulder in oiling his body when he
struggled out of the spiders snare he would now
be furnishing a meal for that monster

  cautiously burl looked all about him he seemed
to be safe then quite deliberately he sat down
to think it was the first time in his life that he
had done such a thing the people of his tribe
were not given to meditation but an idea had
struck burl with all the force of inspiration-an
abstract idea

  when he was in difficulties something within him
seemed to suggest a way out would it suggest an
inspiration now he puzzled over the problem
childlike-and savage-like-the instant the thought
came to him he proceeded to test it out he fixed
his gaze upon his foot the sharp edges of pebbles

of the remains of insect-armour of a dozen things
hurt his feet when he walked they had done so
even since he had been born but never before had
his feet been sticky so that the irritation continued
for more than a single step

  now he gazed upon his foot and waited for the
thought within him to develop meanwhile he
slowly removed the sharp-pointed fragments one by
one partly coated as they were with the half-
liquid gum from his feet they clung to his fingers
as they had to his feet except upon those portions
where the oil was thick as before

  burls reasoning before was simple and of the
primary order where oil covered him the web
did not therefore he would coat the rest of him-
self with oil had he been placed in the same pre-
dicament again he would have used the same means
of escape but to apply a bit of knowldge gained
in one predicament to another difficulty was some-
thing he had not yet done

  a dog may be taught that by pulling on the
latch-string of a door he may open it but the same
dog coming to a high and close-barred gate with a
latch-string attached will never think of pulling
on this second latch-string he associates a latch-
string with the opening of the door the opening
of a gate is another matter entirely

  burl had been stirred to one invention by immi-
nent peril that is not extraordinary but to
reason in cold blood as he presently did that oil
on his feet would nullify the glue upon his feet and
enable him again to walk in comfort-that was a
triumph the inventions of savages are essentially
matters of life and death of food and safety com-
fort and luxury are only produced by intelligence
of a high order

  burl in safety had added to his comfort that
was truly a more important thing in his develop-
ment than almost any other thing he could have
done he oiled his feet

  it was an almost infinitesimal problem but burls
struggles with the mental process of reasoning were
actual thirty thousand years before him a wise
man had pointed out that education is simply train-
ing in thought in efficient and effective thinking
burls tribe had been too much preoccupied with
food and mere existence to think and now burl
sitting at the base of a squat toadstool that all but
concealed him reexemplified rodins thinker for
the first time in many generations

  for burl to reason that oil upon the soles of
his feet would guard him against sharp stones wa
as much a triumph of intellect as any masterpiece
of art in the ages before him burl was learning
how to think	j

  he stood up walked and crowed in sheer delight
then paused a moment in awe of his own intelli-
gence thirty-five miles from his tribe naked
unarmed utterly ignorant of fire of wood of any
weapons save a spear he had experimented with the
day before abysmally uninformed concerning the
very existence of any art or science burl stopped to
assure himself that he was very wonderful

  pride came to him he wished to display himself
to saya these things upon his feet and his spear
but his spear was gone

  with touching faith in the efficacy of this new
pastime burl sat promptly down again and knitted
the mad planet



his brows just as a superstitious person once con-
vinced that by appeal to a favorite talisman he will
be guided aright will inevitably apply to that talis-
man on all occasions so burl plumped himself down
to think

  these questions were easily answered burl
was naked he would search out garments for him-
self he was weaponless he would find himself
a spear he was hungry-and would seek food and
he was far from his tribe so he would go to them
puerile reasoning of course but valuable because
it was consciously reasoning consciously appealing
to his mind for guidance in difficulty deliberate
progress from a mental desire to a mental resolution

  even in the high civilization of ages before few
men had really used their brains the great ma-
jority of people had depended upon machines and
their leaders to think for them burls tribe-folk
depended on their stomachs burl however was
gradually developing the habit ofthinking which
makes for leadership and which would be invalu-
able to his little tribe

  he stood up again and faced up-stream moving
slowly and cautiously his eyes searching the ground
before him keenly and his ears alert for the slightest
sound of danger gigantic butterflies riotous in
coloring fluttered overhead through the misty
haze sometimes a grasshopper hurtled through
the air like a projectile its transparent wings beat-
ing the air frantically now and then a wasp sped
by intent upon its hunting or a bee droned heavily
along anxious and worried striving in a nearly
flowerless world to gather the pollen that would
feed the hive

  here and there burl saw flies of various sorts
somo no larger than his thumb but others the size
of his whole hand they fed upon the juices that
dripped from the maggot-infested mushrooms when
filth more to their liking was not at hand

  very far away a shrill roaring sounded faintly
it was like a multitude of clickings blended into
a single sound but was so far away that it did not
impress itself upon burls attention he had all
the strictly localized vision of a child what was
near was important and what was distant could be
ignored only the imminent required attention
and burl was preoccupied

  had he listened he would have realized that army
ants were abroad in countless millions spreading
themselves out in a broad array and eating all they
came upon far more destructively than so many
locusts

  locusts in past ages had eaten all green things
there were only giant cabbages and a few such
tenacious rank growths in the world that burl
knew the locusts had vanished with civilization
and knowledge and the greater part of mankind but
the army ants remained as an invincible enemy to
men and insects and the most of the fungus growths
that covered the earth

  burl did not notice the sound however he moved
forward briskly though cautiously searching with
his eyes for garments food and weapons he con-
fidently expected to find all of them within a short
distance

  surely enough he found a thicket-if one might
call it so-of edible fungi no more than half a mile
beyond the spot where he had improvised his ban-

dais to protect the soles of his feet

  without especial elation burl tugged at the
largest until he had broken off a food supply for
several days he went on eating as he did so
past a broad plain a mile and more across being
broken into odd little hillocks by gradually ripen-
ing and suddenly developing mushrooms with which
he was unfamiliar

  the earth seemed to be in process of being pushed
aside by rounded protuberances of which only the
tips showed blood-red hemispheres seemed to be
forcing aside the earth so they might reach the
outer air

  burl looked at them curiously and passed among
them without touching them they were strange
and to burl most strange things meant danger in
any event burl was full of a new purpose now he
wished garments and weapons

  above the plain a wasp hovered a heavy object
dangling beneath its black belly ornamented by a
single red band it was a wasp-the hairy sand-
wasp-and it was bringing a paralyzed gray cater-
pillar to its burrow

  burl watched it drop down with the speed and
sureness of an arrow pull aside a heavy flat stone
and descend into the ground it had a vertical
shaft dug down for forty feet or more

  it descended evidently inspected the interior re-
appeared and vanished into the hole again drag-
ging the gray worm after it burl marching on
over the broad plain that seemed stricken with some
erupting disease from the number of red pimples
making their appearance did not know what passed
below but observed the wasp emerge again and
busily scratch dirt and stones into the shaft until
it was full

  the wasp had paralyzed a caterpillar taken it to
the already prepared burrow laid an egg upon it
and filled up the entrance in course of time the egg
would hatch into a grub barely as long as burls
forefinger which would then feed upon the torpid
caterpillar until it had waxed large and fat then
it would weave itself a chrysalis and sleep a long
sleep only to wake as a wasp and dig its way to the
open air

  burl reached the farther side of the plain and
found himself threading the aisles of one of the
fungus forests in which the growths were hideous
misshapen travesties upon the trees they had sup-
planted bloated yellow limbs branched off from
rounded swollen trunks here and there a pear-
shaped puff-ball burls height and half as much
again waited craftily until a chance touch should
cause it to shoot upward a curling puff of infinitely
fine dust

  burl went cautiously there were dangers here
but he moved forward steadily none the less a
great mass of edible mushroom was slung under
one of his arms and from time to time he broke
off a fragment and ate of it while his large eyes
searched this way and that for threats of harm

  behind him a high shrill roaring had grown
slightly in volume and nearness but was still too
far away to impress burl the army ants were
working havoc in the distance by thousands and
millions myriads upon myriads they were foraging
the country clambering upon every eminence des-
cending into every depression their antenna wav-

ing restlessly and their mandibles forever threaten-
ingly extended the ground was black with them
and each was ten inches and more in length

  a single such creature would be formidable to an
unarmed and naked man like burl whose wisest
move would be flight but in their thousands and
millions they presented a menace from which no
escape seemed possible they were advancing
steadily and rapidly shrill stridulations and a mul-
titude of clickings marking their movements

  the great helpless caterpillars upon the giant
cabbages heard the sound of their coming but were
too stupid to flee the black multitudes covered the
rank vegetables and tiny but voracious jaws began
to tear at the flaccid masses of flesh

  each creature had some futile means of strug-
gling the caterpillars strove to throw off their
innumerable assailants by writhings and contor-
tions wholly ineffective the bees fought their en-
trance to the gigantic hives with stings and wing-
beats the moths took to the air in helpless blind-
ness when discovered by the relentless throngs of
small black insects which reeked of formic acid and
left the ground behind them denuded of every liv-
ing thing

  before the oncoming horde was a world of teem-
ing life where mushrooms and fungi fought with
thinning numbers of giant cabbages for foothold
behind the black multitude was-nothing mush-
rooms cabbages bees wasps cricket every creep-
ing and crawling thing that did not get aloft be-
fore the black tide reached it was lost tom to bits
by tiny mandibles even the hunting spiders and
tarantulas fell before the hosts of insects having
killed many in their final struggles but over-
whelmed by sheer numbers and the wounded and
dying army ants made food for their sound com-
rades

  there is no mercy among insects only the web-
spiders sat unmoved and immovable in their colos-
sal snares secure in the knowledge that their
gummy webs would discourage attempts at invasion
along the slender supporting cables

  surging onward flowing like a monstrous
murky tide over the yellow steaming earth the
army ants advanced their vanguard reached the
river and recoiled burl was perhaps five miles
distant when they changed their course communi-
cating the altered line of march to those behind
them in some mysterious fashion of transmitting
intelligence

  thirty thousand years before scientists had de-
bated gravely over the means of communication
among ants they had observed that a single ant
finding a bit of booty too large for him to handle
alone would return to the ant-city and return with
others from that one instance they deduced a
language of gesture made with the antennas

  burl had no wise theories he merely knew facts
but he knew that the ants had some form of speech
or transmission of ideas now however he was
moving cautiously along toward the stamping-
grounds of his tribe in complete ignorance of the
black blanket of living creatures creeping over the
ground toward him

  a million tragedies marked the progress of the
insect army there was a tiny colony of mining
bees-zebra bees-a single mother some four feet

long had dug a huge gallery with some ten cells
in which she laid her eggs and fed her grubs with
hard-gathered pollen the grubs had waxed fat
and large became bees and laid eggs in their
turn within the gallery their mother had dug out
for them

  ten such bulky insects now foraged busily for
grubs within the ancestral home while the founder
of the colony had grown draggled and wingless with
the passing of time unable to forage herself
the old bee became the guardian of the nest or hive
as is the custom among the mining bees she
closed the opening of the hive with her head mak-
ing a living barrier within the entrance and with-
drawing to give entrance and exit only to duly
authenticated members of the colony

  the ancient and draggled concierge of the under-
ground dwelling was at her post when the wave of
army ants swept over her tiny evil-smelling feet
trampled upon her she emerged to fight with
mandible and sting for the sanctity of the hive
in a moment she was a shaggy mass of biting ants
rending and tearing at her chitinous armour the
old bee fought madly viciously sounding a buzzing
alarm to the colonists yet within the hive they
emerged fighting as they came for the gallery lead-
ing down was a dark flood of small insects

  for a few moments a battle such as would make
an epic was in progress ten huge bees each four
to five feet long fighting with legs and jaw wing
and mandible with all the ferocity of as many
tigers the tiny vicious ants covered them snap-
ping at their multiple eyes biting at the tender
joints in their armour-sometimes releasing the
larger prey to leap upon an injured comrade wound-
ed by the huge creature they battled in common

  the fight however could have but one ending
struggle as the bees might herculean as their ef-
forts might be they were powerless against the
incredible numbers of their assailants who tore them
into tiny fragments and devoured them before the
last shred of the hives defenders had vanished
the hive itself was gutted alike of the grubs it had
contained and the food brought to the grubs by
such weary effort of the mature bees

  the army ants went on only an empty gallery
remained that and a few fragments of tough
armour unappetising even to the omnivorous ants

  burl was meditatively inspecting the scene of a
recent tragedy where rent and scraped fragments
of a great beetles shiny casing lay upon the ground
a greater beetle had come upon the first and slain
him burl was looking upon the remains of the
meal

  three or four minims little ants barely six
inches long foraged industriously among the bits
a new ant-city was to be formed and the queen-
ant lay hidden a half-mile away these were the
first hatchlings who would feed the larger ants on
whom would fall the great work of the ant-city
burl ignored them searching with his eyes for a
spear or weapon of some sort

  behind him the clicking roar the high-pitched
stridulations of the horde of army ants rose in
volume burl turned disgustedly away the best
he could find in the way of a weapon was a fiercely
toothed hind-leg he picked it up and an angry
whine rose from the ground
the mad planet



  one of the black minims was working busily to
detach a fragment of flesh from the joint of the
leg and burl had snatched the morsel from him
the little creature was hardly half a foot in length
but it advanced upon burl shrilling angrily he
struck it with the leg and crushed it two of the
other minims appeared attracted by the noise the
first had made discovering the crushed body of
their fellow they unceremoniously dismembered it
and bore it away in triumph

  burl went on swinging the toothed limb in his
hand it made a fair club and burl was accustomed
to use stones to crush the juicy legs of such giant
crickets as his tribe sometimes came upon he
formed a half-defined idea of a club the sharp
teeth of the thing in his hand made him realize
that a sidewise blow was better than a spear-like
thrust

  the sound behind him had become a distant
whispering high-pitched and growing nearer
the army ants swept over a mushroom forest and
the yellow umbrella-like growths swarmed with
black creatures devouring the substance on which
they found a foot-hold

  a great blue-bottle fly shining with a metallic
luster reposed in an ecstacy of feasting sipping
through its long proboscis the dark-colored liquid
that dripped slowly from a mushroom maggots
filled the mushroom and exuded a solvent pepsin that
liquified the white firm meat

  they fed upon this soup this gruel and a surplus
dripped to the ground below where the blue-bottle
drank eagerly burl drew near and struck the
fly collapsed into a writhing heap burl stood over
it for an instant pondering

  the army ants came nearer down into a tiny
valley swarming into and through a little brook
over which burl had leaped ants can remain
under water for a long time without drowning so
the small stream was but a minor obstacle though
the current of water swept many of them off their
feet until they choked the brook-bed and their com-
rades passed over their struggling bodies dry-shod
they were no more than temporarily annoyed how-
ever and crawled out to resume their march

  about a quarter of a mile to the left of burls
line of march and perhaps a mile behind the spot
where he stood over the dead blue-bottle fly there
was a stretch of an acre or more where the giant
rank cabbages had so far resisted the encroach-
ments of the ever-present mushrooms the pale
cross-shaped flowers of the cabbages formed food
for many bees and the leaves fed numberless grubs
and worms and loud-voiced crickets which crouched
about on the ground munching busily at the succu-
lent green stuff the army ants swept into the
green area ceaselessly devouring all they came up-
on

  a terrific din arose the crickets hurtled away
in rocket-like flight in a dark cloud of wildly-beat-
ing wings they shot aimlessly in any direction
with the result that half or more that half fell
in the midst of the black tide of devouring insects
and were seized as they fell they uttered terrible
cries as they were being torn to bits horrible in-
human screams reached burls ears

  a single such cry of agony would not have at-
tracted burls attention-he lived in the very

atmosphere of tragedy-but the chorus of crea-
tures in torment made him look up this was no
minor horror wholesale slaughter was going on
he peered anxiously in the direction of the sound

  a stretch of sickly yellow fungus was here and
there interspersed with a squat toadstool or a splash
of vivid color where one of the many rusts had
found a foothold to the left a group of awkward
misshapen fungoids clustered in silent mockery of
a forest of trees there was a mass of faded green
where the giant cabbages stood

  with the true sun never shining upon them save
through a blanket of thick haze or heavy clouds
they were pallid things hut they were the only
green things burl had seen their nodding white
flowers with four petals in the form of a cross
glowed against the yellowish-green leaves but
as burl gazed toward them the green became slowly
black

  from where he stood burl could see two or three
great grubs in lazy contentment eating ceaselessly
of the cabbages on which they rested suddenly
first one and then the other began to jerk spasmo-
dically burl saw that about each of them a tiny
rim of black had clustered tiny black motes milled
over the green surfaces of the cabbages the grubs
became black the cabbages became black horrible
contortions of the writhing grubs told of the
agonies they were enduring then a black wave
appeared at the further edge of the stretch of
sickly yellow fungus a glistening living wave that
moved forward rapidly with the the roar of click-
ings and a persistent overtone of shrill stridula-
tions

  the hair rose upon burls head he knew what
this was he knew all too well the meaning of
that tide of shining bodies with a gasp of terror
all his intellectual preoccupations forgotten he
turned and fled in ultimate panic and the tide
came slowly on after him

chapter iv

the red death

he flung away the great mass of edible mush-
room but clung to his sharp-toothed club
desperately and darted through the tangled
aisles of the little mushroom forest with a heedless
disregard of the dangers that might await him
there flies buzzed about him loudly huge crea-
tures glittering with a metallic luster once he
was struck upon the shoulder by the body of one
of them and his skin was torn by the swiftly
vibrating wings of the insect as long as burls
hand

  burl thrust it away and sped on the oil with
which he was partly covered had turned rancid
now and the odor attracted them connoisseurs of
the fetid they buzzed over his head keeping pace
even with his head-long flight

  a heavy weight settled upon his head and in a
moment was doubled two of the creatures had
dropped upon his oily hair to sip the rancid oil
through their disgusting proboscides burl shook
them off with his hand and ran madly on his
ears were keenly attuned to the sound of the army
ants behind him and it grew but little farther
away


amazing stories

  the clicking roar continued but began to be
overshadowed by the buzzing of the flies in burls
time the flies had not great heaps of putrid matter
in which to lay their eggs the ants-busy
scavengers-carted away the debris of the mul-
titudinous tragedies of the insect world long before
it could acquire the gamey flavor beloved by the fly
maggots only in isolated spots were the flies
really numerous but there they clustered in clouds
that darkened the sky

  such a buzzing whirling cloud surrounded the
madly-running figure of burl it seemed as though
a miniature whirlwind kept pace with the little pink-
skinned man a whirlwind composed of winged
bodies and multi-faceted eyes he twirled his club
before him and almost every stroke was interrupted
by an -mpact against a thinly-armoured body which
collapsed with a spurting of reddish liquid

  an agonizing pain as of a red-hot iron struck
upon burls back one of the stinging flies had
thrust its sharp-tipped proboscis into burls flesh
to suck the blood

  burl uttered a cry and-ran full tilt into the
thick stalk of a blackened and draggled toadstool
there was a curious crackling as of wet punk or
brittle rotten wood the toadstool collapsed upon
itself with a strange splashing sound many flies
had laid their eggs in the fungoid and it was a
teeming mass of corruption and ill-smelling liquid

  with the crash of the toadstools head upon the
ground it fell into a dozen pieces and the earth for
yards around was spattered with a stinking liquid
in which tiny headless maggots twitched convul-
sively

  the buzzing of the flies took on a note of satis-
faction and they settled by hundreds about the edges
of the ill-smelling pools becoming lost in the
ecstacy of feasting while burl staggered to his feet
and darted off again this time he was but a minor
attraction to the flies and but one or two came near
him from every direction they were hurrying to
the toadstool feast to the banquet of horrible lique-
fied fungus that lay spread upon the ground

  burl ran on he passed beneath the wide-spread-
ing leaves of a giant cabbage a great grass-hop-
per crouched upon the ground its tremendous jaws
crunching the rank vegetation voraciously half a
dozen great worms ate steadily from their resting-
places among the leaves one of them slung itself
beneath an over-hanging leaf-which would have
thatched a dozen homes for as many men-and was
placidly anchoring itself in preparation for the
spinning of a cocoon in which to sleep the sleep of
metamorphosis

  a mile away the great black tide of army ants
was advancing relentlessly the great cabbage the
huge grasshopper and all the stupid caterpillars up-
on the wide leaves would soon be covered with the
tiny biting insects the cabbage would be reduced
to a chewed and destroyed stump the colossal furry
grubs would be torn into a myriad mouthfuls and
devoured by the black army ants and the grass-
hopper would strike out with terrific unguided
strength crushing its assailants by blows of its
powerful hind-legs and bites of its great jaws but
it would die making terrible sounds of torment as
the vicious mandibles of the army ants found
crevices in its armour

  the clicking roar of the ants advance oversha-
dowed all other sound now burl was running
madly his breath coming in great gasps his eyes
wide with panic alone of all the world about him
he knew the danger behind the insects he passed
were going about their business with that terrify-
ing efficiency found only in the insect world

  there is something strangely daunting in the ac-
tions of an insect it moves so directly with such
uncanny precision with such utter indifference to
anything but the end in view cannibalism is a
rule almost without exception the paralysis of
prey so it may remain alive and fresh-though in
agony-for weeks on end is a common practice
the eating piecemeal of still-living victims is a
matter of course

  absolute mercilessness utter callousness in-
credible inhumanity beyond anything known in the
animal world is the natural and commonplace
practice of the insects and these vast cruelties
are performed by armoured machine-like creatures
with an abstraction and a routine air that suggests
a horrible nature behind them all

  burl nearly stumbled upon a tragedy he passed
within a dozen yards of a space where a female
dung-beetle was devouring the mate whose honey-
moon had begun that same day and ended in that
gruesome fashion hidden behind a clump of mush-
rooms a great yellow-banded spider was coyly
threatening a smaller male of her own species he
was discreetly ardent but if he won the favor of the
gruesome creature he was wooing he would fur-
nish an appetizing meal for her some time within
twenty-four hours

  burls heart was pounding madly the breath
whistled in his nostrils-and behind him the wave
of army ants was drawing nearer they came upon
the feasting flies some took to the air and escaped
but others were too engrossed in their delicious
meal the twitching little maggots stranded upon
the earth by the scattering of their soupy broth
were torn in pieces the flies who were seized
vanished into little maws the serried ranks of
black insects went on

  the tiny clickings of their limbs the perpetual
challenges and cross-challenges of crossed antenna
the stridulations of the creatures all combined to
make a high-pitched but deafening din now and
then another sound pierced the noises made by the
ants themselves a cricket seized by a thousand
tiny jaws uttered cries of agony the shrill note
of the crickets had grown deeply bass with the in-
crease in size of the organs that uttered it

  there was a strange contrast between the ground
before the advancing horde and that immediately
behind it before a busy world teeming with life
butterflies floating overhead on lazy wings grubs
waxing fat and huge upon the giant cabbages
crickets eating great spiders sitting quietly in their
lairs waiting with invincible patience for prey to
draw near their trap-doors or fall into their webs
colossal beetles lumbering heavily through the
mushroom forests seeking food making love in
the monstrous tragic fashion

  and behind the wide belt of army ants-chaos
the edible mushrooms gone the giant cabbages
left as mere stumps of unappetizing pulp the busy
life of the insect world completely wiped out save
the mad planet



for the flying creatures that fluttered helplessly
over an utterly changed landscape here and there
little bands of stragglers moved busily over the
denuded earth searching for some fragment of
food that might conceivably have been overlooked
by the main body

  burl was putting forth his last ounce of strength
his limbs trembled his breathing was agony sweat
stood out upon his forehead he ran a little naked
man with the disjointed fragment of a huge in-
sects limb in his hand running for his insignifi-
cant life running as if his continued existence
among the million tragedies of that single day were
the purpose for which the universe had been created

  he sped across an open space a hundred yards
across a thicket of beautifully golden mushrooms
agaricus coelareus barred his way beyond the
mushrooms a range of strangely colored hills began
purple and green and black and gold melting into
each other branching off from each other inex-
tricably tangled

  they rose to a height of perhaps sixty or seventy
feet and above them a little grayish haze had gath-
ered there seemed to be a layer of tenuous vapor
upon their surfaces which slowly rose and coiled
and gathered into a tiny cloudlet above their tips

  the hills themselves were but masses of fungus
mushrooms and rusts fungoids of every descrip-
tion yeasts musts and every form of fungus
growth which had grown within itself and about
itself until this great mass of strangely colored
spongy stuff had gathered in a mass that undulated
unevenly across the level earth for miles

  burl burst through the golden thicket and attacked
the ascent his feet sank into the spongy sides of
the hillock panting gasping staggering from ex-
haustion he made his way up the top he plunged
into a little valley on the farther side up another
slope for perhaps ten minutes he forced himself
on then collapsed he lay unable to move further
in a little hollow his sharp-toothed club still clasped
in his hands above him a bright yellow butterfly
with a thirty-foot spread of wings fluttered lightly

  he lay motionless breathing in great gasps his
limbs refusing to lift him

  the sound of the army ants continued to grow
near at last above the crest of the last hillock
he had surmounted two tiny antenna appeared
then the black glistening head of an army ant the
forerunner of its horde it moved deliberately for-
ward waving it antennee ceaselessly it made its
way toward burl tiny clickings coming from the
movements of its limbs

  a little wisp of tenuous vapor swirled toward the
ant a wisp of the same vapor that had gathered
above the whole range of hills as a thin low cloud it
enveloped the insect-and the ant seemed to be
attacked by a strange convulsion its legs moved
aimlessly it threw itself desperately about if
it had been a animal burl would have watched with
wondering eyes while it coughed and gasped but it
was an insect breathing through air-holes in its
abdomen it writhed upon the spongy fungus
growth across which it had been moving

  burl lying in an exhausted panting heap upori
the purple mass of fungus was conscious of a
strange sensation his body felt strangely warm
he knew nothing of fire or the heat of the sun and

the only sensation of warmth he had ever known
was that caused when the members of his tribe
had huddled together in their hiding place when the
damp chill of the night had touched their soft-
slcinned bodies then the heat of their breath and
their bodies had kept out the chill

  this heat that burl now felt was a hotter fiercer
heat he moved his body with a tremendous effort
and for a moment the fungus was cool and soft
beneath him then slowly the sensation of heat be-
gan again increased until burls skin was red
and inflamed from the irritation

  the  thin and tenuous vapor too made burls
lungs smart and his eyes water he was breathing
in great choky gasps but the period of rest-short
as it was-had enabled him to rise and stagger on
he crawled painfully to the top of the slope and
looked back

  the hill-crest on which he stood was higher than
any of those he had passed in his painful run and he
could see clearly the whole of the purple range
where he was he stood near the farther edge of the
range which was here perhaps half a mile wide

  it was a ceaseless undulating mass of hills and
hollows ridges and spurs all of them colored pur-
ple and brown and golden-yellow deepest black and
dingy white and from the tips of most of the
pointed hills little wisps of vapor rose up

  a thin dark cloud had gathered overhead burl
could look to the right and left and see the hills
fading into the distance growing fainter as the
haze above them seemed to grow thicker he saw
too the advancing cohorts of the army ants creep-
ing over the tangled mass of fungus growth they
seemed to be feeding as they went upon the fungus
that had gathered into these incredible monstros-
ities

  the hills were living they were not upheavals
of the ground they were festering heaps of insanely
growing festering mushrooms and fungus upon
most of them a purple mould had spread itself so
that they seemed a range of purple hills but here
and there patches of other vivid colors showed and
there was a large hill whose whole side was a
brilliant golden hue another had tiny bright-red
spots of a strange and malignant mushroom whose
properties burl did not know scattered all over the
purple with which it was covered

  burl leaned heavily upon his club and watched
dully he could run no more the army ants were
spreading everywhere over the mass of fungus
they would reach him soon

  far to the right the vapor thickened a column
of smoke arose what burl did not know and would
never know was that far down in the interior of
that compressed mass of fungus slow oxidation
had been going on the temperature of the interior
had been raised in the darkness and the dampness
deep down in the hills spontaneous combustion had
begun

  just as the vast piles of coal the railroad com-
panies of thirty thousand years before had gathered
together sometimes began to burn fiercely in their
interiors and just as the farmers piles of damp
straw or hay suddenly burst into fierce flames from
no cause so these huge piles of tinder-like mush-
rooms had been burning slowly within themselves

  there had been no flames because the surface

remained intact and nearly air-tight but when
the army ants began to tear at the edible surfaces
despite the heat they encountered fresh air found
its way to the smouldering masses of fungus the
slow combustion became rapid combustion the
dull heat became fierce flames the slow trickle of
thin smoke became a huge column of thick chok-
ing acrid stuff that set the army ants that breathed
it into spasms of convulsive writhing

  from a dozen points the flames burst out a
dozen or more columns of blinding smoke rose to the
heavens a pall of fume-laden smoke gathered
above the range of purple hills while burl watched
apathetically and the serried ranks of army ants
marched on to the widening furnaces that awaited
them

  they had recoiled from the river because their
instinct had warned them thirty thousand years
without danger from fire however had let their
racial fear of fire die out they marched into the
blazing orifices they had opened in the hills snap-
ping with their mandibles at the leaping flames
springing at the glowing tinder

  the blazing areas widened as the purple surface
was undermined and fell in burl watched the
phenomenon without comprehension and even with-
out thankfulness he stood panting more and
more slowly breathing more and more easily until
the glow from the approaching flames reddened his
skin and the acrid smoke made tears flow from his
eyes

  then he retreated slowly leaning on his club and
looking back the black wave of the army ants
was sweeping into the fire sweeping into the in-
credible heat of that carbonized material burning
with an open flame at last there were only the
little bodies of stragglers from the great ant-army
scurrying here and there over the ground their
comrades had denuded of all living things the
bodies of the main army had vanished-burnt to
crisp ashes in the furnace of the hills

  there had been agony in that flame dreadful
agony such as no man would like to dwell upon
the insane courage of the ants attacking with their
horny jaws the burning masses of fungus rolling
over and over with a flaming missile clutched in
their mandibles sounding their shrill war-cry while
cries of agony came from them-blinded their
antennae burnt off their lidless eyes scorched by the
licking flames yet going madly forward on flaming
feet to attack ever attack this unknown and un-
knowable enemy

  burl made his way slowly over the hills twice
he saw small bodies of the army ants they had
passed between the widening surfaces their com-
rades had opened and they were feeding voraciously
upon the hills they trod on once burl was spied
and a shrill war-cry was sounded but he moved
on and the ants were busily eating a single ant
rushed toward him burl brought down his club
and a writhing body remained to be eaten later by
its comrades when they came upon it

  again night fell the sky grew red in the west
though the sun did not shine through the ever-
present cloud bank darkness spread across the
sky utter blackness fell over the whole mad world
save where the luminous mushrooms shed their
pale light upon the ground and fireflies the length

of burls arm shed their fitful gleams upon an earth
of fungus growths and monstrous insects

  burl made his way across the range of mush-
room hills picking his path with his large blue
eyes whose pupils expanded to great size slowly
from the sky now a drop and then a drop now a
drop and then a drop the nightly rain that would
continue until daybreak began

  burl found the ground hard beneath his feet he
listened keenly for sounds of danger something
rustled heavily in a thicket of mushrooms a hun-
dred yards away there were sounds of preening
and of delicate feet placed lightly here and there
upon the ground then the throbbing beat of huge
wings began suddenly and a body took to the air

  a fierce down-coming current of air smote burl
and he looked upward in time to catch the outline
of a huge body-a moth-as it passed above him
he turned to watch the line of its flight and saw
a strange glow in the sky behind him the mush-
room hills were still burning

  he crouched beneath a squat toadstool and waited
for the dawn his club held tightly in his hands and
his ears alert for any sound of danger the slow-
dropping sodden rain kept on it fell with irre-
gular drum-like beats upon the tough top of the
toadstool under which he had taken refuge

  slowly slowly the sodden rainfall continued
drop by drop all the night long the warn pellets
of liquid came from the sky they boomed upon
the hollow heads of the toadstools and splashed in-
to the steaming pools that lay festering all over the
fungus-covered earth

  and all the night long the great fires grew and
spread in the mass of already half-carbonized mush-
room the flare at the horizon grew brighter and
nearer burl naked and hiding beneath a huge
mushroom wondering with wide eyes what this
thing was watched it grow near him he had never
seen a flame before

  the overhanging clouds were brightened by the
flames over a stretch at least a dozen miles in
length and from half a mile to three miles across
seething furnaces sent columns of dense smoke up
to the roof of clouds luminous from the glow be-
low them and spreading out and forming an inter-
mediate layer below the cloudbanks themselves

  it wras like the glow of all the many lighls of a
vast city thrown against the sky-but the last great
city had moulded into fungus-covered rubbish thirty
thousand years before like the flitting of air-
planes above a populous city too was the flitting of
fascinated creatures above the glow

  moths and great flying beetles gigantic gnats
and midges grown huge with the passing of time
they fluttered and danced the dance of death above
the flames as the fire grew nearer to burl he
could see them

  colossal delicately-formed creatures swooped
above the strange blaze moths with their riotously-
colored wings of thirty-foot spread beat the air with
mighty strokes and their huge eyes glowed like
carbuncles as they stared with the frenzied gaze
of intoxicated devotees into the glowing flames be-
low them

  burl saw a great peacock moth soaring above the
burning mushroom hills its wings were all of
forty feet across and fluttered like gigantic sails
the mad planet



as the moth gazed down at the flaming furnace be-
low the separate flames had united now and a
single sheet of white-hot burning stuff spread across
the country for miles sending up its clouds of
smoke in which and through which the fascinated
creatures flew

  feathery antennse of the finest lace spread out
before the head of the peacock moth and its body
was softest richest velvet a ring of snow-white
down marked where its head began and the red
glow from below smote on the maroon of its body
with a strange effect

  for one instant it was outlined clearly its eyes
glowed more redly than any rubys fire and the
great delicate wings were poised in flight burl
caught the flash of the flumes upon two great irides-
cent spots upon the wide-spread wings shining
purple and vivid red the glow of opal and the
sheen of pearl all the glory of chalcedony and of
chrysoprase formed a single wonder in the red
glare of burning fungus white smoke compassed
the great moth all about dimming the radiance of its
gorgeous dress

  burl saw it dart straight into the thickest and
brightest of the licking flames flying madly eagerly
into the searing hellish heat as a willing drunken
sacrifice to the god of fire

  monster flying beetles with their horny wing-
cases stiffly stretched blundered above the reeking
smoking pyre in the red light from before them
they shone like burnished metal and their clumsy
bodies with the spurred and fierce-toothed limbs
darted like so many grotesque meteors through the
luminous haze of ascending smoke

  burl saw strange collisions and still stranger
meetings male and female flying creatures cir-
cled and spun in the glare dancing their dance of
love and death in the wild radiance from the funeral
pyre of the purple hills they mounted higher
than burl could see drunk with the ecstacy of liv-
ing then descended to plunge headlong to death in
the roaring fires beneath them

  from every side the creatures came moths of
brightest yellow with soft and furry bodies pal-
pitant with life flew madly into the column of light
that reached to the overhanging clouds then moths
of deepest black with gruesome symbols upon their
wings came swiftly to dance like motes in sunlight
above the glow

  and burl sat crouched beneath an overshadowing
toadstool and watched thc perpetual slow sod-
den raindrops fell a continual faint hissing pene-
trated the sound of the fire-the raindrops being
turned to steam the air was alive with flying
things from far away burl heard a strange deep
bass muttering he did not know the cause but
there was a vast swamp of the existence of which
he was ignorant some ten or fifteen miles away
and the chorus of insect-eating giant frogs reached
his ears even at that distance

  the night wore on while the flying creatures
above the fire danced and died their numbers ever
recruited by fresh arrivals burl sat tensely still
his wide eyes watching everything his mind grop-
ing for an explanation of what he saw at last the
sky grew dimly gray then brighter and day came
on the flames of the burning hills grew faint as

the fire died down and after a long time burl crept
from his hiding-place and stood erect

  a hundred yards from where he was a straight
wall of smoke rose from the still smoldering fungus
and burl could see it stretching for miles in either
direction he turned to continue on his way and
saw the remains of one of the tragedies of the night

  a huge moth had flown into the flames been hor-
ribly scorched and floundered out again had it
been able to fly it would have returned to its de-
vouring deity but now it lay immovable upon the
ground its antenna seared hopelessly one beauti-
ful delicate wing burned in gaping holes its eyeg
dimmed by flame and its exquisitely tapering limbs
broken and crushed by the force with which it had
struck the ground it lay helpless upon the earth
only the stumps of its antennse moving restlessly
and its abdomen pulsating slowly as it drew pain-
racked breaths

  burl drew near and picked up a stone he moved
on presently a velvet cloak cast over his shoulders
gleaming with all the colors of the rainbow a
gorgeous mass of soft blue moth fur was about his
middle and he had bound upon his forehead two
yard-long golden fragments of the moths magnifi-
cent antennae he strode on slowly clad as no man
had been clad in all the ages

  after a little he secured a spear and took up his
journey to saya looking like a prince of ind upon
a bridal journey-though no mere prince ever wore
such raiment in days of greatest glory

chapter v

the conqueror

for many long miles burl threaded his way
through a single forest of thin-stalked toad-
stools they towered three man-heights high
and all about their bases were streaks and splashes
of the rusts and molds that preyed upon them
twice burl came to open glades wherein open
bubbling pools of green sfirae festered in corruption
and once he hid himself fearfully as a monster
scarabeus beetle lumbered within three yards of
him moving heavily onward with a clanking of
limbs as of some mighty machine

  burl saw the mighty armor and the inward-curv-
ing jaws of the creature and envied him his
weapons the time was not yet come however
when burl would smile at the great insect and hunt
him for the juicy flesh contained in those armored
limbs

  burl was still a savage still ignorant still timid
his principal advance had been that whereas he had
fled without reasoning he now paused to see if he
need flee in his hands he bore a long sharp-
pointed chitinous spear it had been the weapon
of a huge unnamed flying insect scorched td
death in the burning of the purple hills which had
floundered out of the flames to die burl had
worked for an hour before being able to detach
the weapon he coveted it was as long and longer
than burl himself

  he was a strange sight moving slowly and cau-
tiously through the shadowed lanes of the mush-
room forest a cloak of delicate velvet in which all
the colors of the rainbow played in iridescent beauty
hung from his shoulders a mass of soft and beau-


amazing stories

tiful moth fur was about his middle and in the
strip of sinew about his waist the fiercely toothed
limb of a fighting beetle was thrust carelessly he
had bound to his forehead twin sacks of a great
moths feathery golden antennas

  against the play of color that came from his bor-
rowed plumage his pink skin showed in odd con-
trast he looked like some proud knight walking
slowly through the gardens of a goblins castle but
he was still a fearful creature no more than the
monstrous creatures about him save in the posses-
sion of latent intelligence he was weak-and
therein lay his greatest promise a hundred thou-
sand years before him his ancestors had been forced
by lack of claws and fangs to develop brains

  burl was sunk as low as they had been but he
had to combat more horrifying enemies more inex-
orable threatenings and many times more crafty
assailants his ancestors had invented knives and
spears and flying missiles the creatures about
burl had knives and spears a thousand times more
deadly than the weapons that had made his ances-
tors masters of the woods and forests

  burl was in comparison vastly more weak than
his forbears had been and it was that weakness
that in times to come would lead him and those
who followed him to heights his ancestors had never
known but now-

  he heard a discordant deep bass bellow coming
from a spot not twenty yards away in a flash of
panic he darted behind a clump of the mushrooms
and hid himself panting in sheer terror he
waited for an instant in frozen fear motionless and
tense his wide blue eyes were glassy

  the bellow came again but this time with a
querulous note burl heard a crashing and plunging
as of some creature caught in a snare a mush-
room fell with a brittle snapping and the spongy
thud as it fell to the ground was followed by a
tremendous commotion something was fighting
desperately against something else but burl did
not know what creature or creatures might be in
combat

  he waited for a long time and the noise gradu-
ally died away presently burls breath came more
slowly and his courage returned he stole from his
hiding-place and would have made away but some-
thing held him back instead of creeping from the
scene he crept cautiously over toward the source of
the noise

  he peered between two cream-colored toadstool
stalks and saw the cause of the noise a wide fun-
nel-shaped snare of silk was spread out before him
some twenty yards across and as many deep the
individual threads could be plainly seen but in the
mass it seemed a fabric of sheerest finest texture
held up by the tall mushrooms it was anchored to
the ground below and drew away to a tiny point
through which a hole gave on some yet unknown re-
cess and all the space of the wide snare was
hung with threads fine twisted threads no more
than half the thickness of burls finger

  this was the trap of a labyrinth spider not one
of the interlacing threads was strong enough to
hold the feeblest of prey but the threads were there
by thousands a great cricket had become en-
tangled in the maze of sticky lines its limbs
thrashed out smashing the snare-lines at every

stroke but at every stroke meeting and becoming
entangled with a dozen more it thrashed about
mightily emitting at intervals the horrible deep
bass cry that the chirping voice of the cricket had
become with its increase in size

  burl breathed more easily and watched with a
fascinated curiosity mere death-even tragic
death-as among insects held no great interest for
him it was a matter of such common and matter-
of-fact occurrence that he was not greatly stirred
but a spider and his prey was another matter

  there were few insects that deliberately sought
man most insects have their allotted victims and
will touch no others but spiders have a terrifying
impartiality one great beetle devouring another
was a matter of indifference to burl a spider de-
vouring some luckless insect was but an example
of what might happen to him he watched alertly
his gaze travelling from the emmeshed cricket to
the strange orifice at the rear of the funnel-shaped
snare

  the opening darkened two shining glistening
eyes had been watching from the rear of the fun-
nel it drew itself into a tunnel there in which
the spider had been waiting now it swung out
lightly and came toward the cricket it was a gray
spider agelena labyrintkica with twin black rib-
bons upon its thorax next the head and with two
stripes of curiously speckled brown and white upon
its abdomen burl saw too two curious appendages
like a tail

   it came nimbly out of its tunnel-like hiding-place
and approached the cricket the cricket was strug-
gling only feebly now and the cries it uttered were
but feeble because of the confining threads that
fettered its limbs burl saw the spider throw itself
upon the cricket and saw the final convulsive shud-
der of the insect as the spiders fangs pierced its
tough armor the sting lasted a long time and
finally burl saw that the spider was really feeding
all the succulent juices of the now dead cricket were
being sucked from its body by the spider it had
stung the cricket upon the haunch and presently it
went to the other leg and drained that too by means
of its powerful internal suction-pump when the
second haunch had been sucked dry the spider
pawed the lifeless creature for a few moments and
left it

  food was plentiful and the spider could afford
to be dainty in its feeding the two choicest titbits
had been consumed the remainder could be dis-
carded

  a sudden thought came to burl and quite took his
breath away for a second his knees knocked to-
gether in self-induced panic he watched the gray
spider carefully with growing determination in his
eyes he burl had killed a hunting-spider upon
the red-clay cliff true the killing had been an
accident and had nearly cost him his own life a few
minutes later in the web-spiders snare but he had
killed a spider and of the most deadly kind

  now a great ambition was growing in burls
heart his tribe had always feared spiders too
much to know much of their habits but they knew
one or two things the most important was that
the snare-spiders never left their lairs to hunt-
never burl was about to make a daring applica-
tion of that knowledge
the mad planet



  ho drew back from the white and shining snare
and crept softly to the rear the fabric gathered
itself into a point and then continued for some
twenty feet as a tunnel in which the spider waited
while dreaming of its last meal and waiting for
the next victim to become entangled in the laby-
rinth in front burl made his way to a point where
the tunnel was no more than ten feet away and
waited

  presently through the interstices of the silk he
saw the gray bulk of the spider it had left the ex-
hausted body of the cricket and returned to its
resting-place it settled itself carefully upon the
soft walls of the tunnel with its shining eyes fixed
upon the tortuous threads of its trap burls
hair was standing straight up upon his head from
sheer fright but he was the slave of an idea

  he drew near and poised his spear his new and
sharp spear taken from the body of an unknown
dying creature killed by the burning purple hills
burl raised the spear and aimed its sharp and
deadly point at the thick gray bulk he could see
dimly through the threads of the tunnel he thrust
it home with all his strength-and ran away at the
top of his speed glassy-eyed from terror

  a long time later he ventured near again his
heart in his mouth ready to flee at the slightest
sound all was still burl had missed the hor-
rible convulsions of the wounded spider had not
heard the frightful gnashings of its fangs as it
gnashed at the piercing weapon had not seen the
silken threads of the tunnel ripped and torn as the
spider-hurt to death-had struggled with insane
strength to free itself

  he came back beneath the overshadowing toad-
stools stepping quietly and cautiously to find a
great rent in the silken tunnel to find the great
gray bulk lifeless and still half-fallen through the
opening the spear had first made a little puddle
of evil-smelling liquid lay upon the ground below
the body and from time to time a droplet fell from
the spear into the puddle with a curious splash

  burl looked at what he had done saw the dead
body of the creature he had slain saw the ferocious
mandibles and the keen and deadly fangs the
dead eyes of the creature still stared at him malig-
nantly and the hairy legs were still braced as if
further to enlarge the gaping hole through which
it had partly fallen

  exultation filled burls heart his tribe had been
but furtive vermin for thousands of years fleeing
from the mighty insects and hiding from them if
overtaken but waiting helplessly for death scream-
ing shrilly in terror

  he burl had turned the tables he had slain
one of the enemies of his tribe his breast ex-
panded always his tribesmen went quietly and
fearfully making no sound but a sudden exul-
tant yell burst from burls lips-the first hunting
cry from the lips of a man in a hundred centuries

  the next second his pulse nearly stopped in sheer
panic at having made such a noise he listened
fearfully but there was no sound he drew near
his prey and carefully withdrew his spear the vis-
cid liquid made it slimy and slippery and he had
to wipe it dry against a leathery toadstool then
burl had to conquer his logical fear again before
daring to touch the creature he had slain

  he moved off presently with the belly of the
spider upon his back and two of the hairy legs over
his shoulders the other limbs of the monster hung
limp and trailed upon the ground burl was now
a still more curious sight as a gayly colored object
with a cloak shining in iridescent colors the golden
antennse of a great moth rising from his forehead
and the hideous bulk of a gray spider for a burden

  he moved through the thin-stalked mushroom
forest and because of the thing he carried all crea-
tures fled before him they did not fear man-
their instinct was slow-moving-but during all the
millions of years that insects have existed there
have existed spiders to prey upon them so burl
moved on in solemn state a brightly clad man bent
beneath the weight of a huge and horrible monster

  he came upon a valley full of torn and blackened
mushrooms there was not a single yellow top
among them every one had been infested with
tiny maggots which had liquefied the tough meat
of the mushroom and caused it to drip to the
ground below and all the liquid had gathered in a
golden pool in the center of the small depression
burl heard a loud humming and buzzing before he
topped the rise that opened the valley for his in-
spection he stopped a moment and looked down

  a golden-red lake its center reflecting the hazy
sky overhead all about blackened mushrooms
seeming to have been charred and burned by a fierce
flame a slow-flowing golden brooklet trickled
slowly over a rocky ledge into the larger pool and
all about the edges of the golden lake in ranks
and rows by hundreds thousands and by millions
were ranged the green-gold shining bodies of great
flies

  they were small as compared with the other in-
sects they had increased in size but a fraction of
the amount that the bees for example had in-
creased  but it was due to an imperative necessity
of their race

  the flesh-flies iaid their eggs by hundreds in de-
caying carcasses the others laid their eggs by hun-
dreds in the mushrooms to feed the maggots that
would hatch a relatively great quantity of food
was needed therefore the flies must remain com-
paratively small or the body of a single grasshop-
per say would furnish food for but two or three
grubs instead of the hundreds it must support

  burl stared down at the golden pool bluebottles
greenbottles and all the flies of metallic luster were
gathered at the lucullan feast of corruption their
buzzing as they darted above the odorous pool of
golden liquid made the sound burl had heard their
bodies flashed and glittered as they darted back and
forth seeking a place to alight and join in the orgy

  those which clustered about the banks of the
pool were still as if carved from metal their huge
red eyes glowed and their bodies shone with an
obscene fatness flies are the most digusting of
all insects burl watched them a moment watched
the interlacing streams of light as they buzzed
eagerly above the pool seeking a place at the festive
board

  a drumming roar sounded in the air a golden
speck appeared in the sky a slender needlelike body
with transparent shining wings and two huge eyes
it grew nearer and became a dragon-fly twenty feet
and more in length its body shimmering purest

gold it poised itself above thc pool and then
darted down its jaws snapped viciously and re-
peatedly and at each snapping the glittering body
of a fly vanished

  a second dragon-fly appeared its body a vivid
purple and a third they swooped and rushed
above the golden pool snapping in mid air turning
their abrupt angular turns creatures of incredible
ferocity and beauty at the moment they were noth-
ing more or less than slaughtering-machines they
darted here and there their many-faceted eyes
burning with blood-lust in that mass of buzzing
flies even the most voracious appetite must be
sated but the dragon-flies kept on beautiful
slender graceful creatures they dashed here and
there above the pond like avenging fiends or the
mythical dragons for which they had been named

  and the loud contented buzzing kept on as be-
fore their comrades were being slaughtered by
hundreds not fifty feet above their heads but the
glittering rows of red-eyed flies gorging themselves
upon the golden evil-smelling liquid kept placidly
on with their feasting the dragon-flies could con-
tain no more even of their chosen prey but they
continued to swoop madly above the pool striking
down the buzzing flies even though the bodies
must perforce drop uneaten one or two of the
dead flies-crushed to a pulp by the angry jaws
of a great dragon-fly-dropped among its feasting
brothers they shook themselves

  presently one of them placed its disgusting pro-
boscis upon the mangled form and sipped daintily
of the juices exuding from the broken armor
another joined it and another in a little while a
cluster of them elbowed and pushed each other for
a chance to join in the cannibalistic feast

  burl turned aside and went on while the slim
forms of the dragon-flies still darted here and
there above the pool still striking down the dron-
ing flies with vengeful strokes of their great jaws
while a rain of crushed bodies was falling to the
contented glistening horde below

  only a few miles farther on burl came upon a
familiar landmark he knew it well but from a
safe distance as always a mass of rock had heaved
itself up from the nearly level plain over which he
was traveling and formed an outjutting clilt at
one point the rock overhung a sheer drop making
an inverted ledge-a roof over nothingness-which
had been preempted by a hairy creature and made
into a fairylike dwelling a white hemisphere clung
tenaciously to the rock above and long cables
anchored it firmly

  burl knew the place as one to be fearfully avoided
a clotho spider qlotho durandi had built itself
a nest there from which it emerged to hunt the
unwary within that half-globe there was a mon-
ster resting upon a cushion of softest silk but
if one went too near one of the little inverted arches
seemingly firmly closed by a wall of silk would open
and a creature out of a dream of hell emerge to run
with fiendish agility toward its prey

  surely burl knew the place hung upon the
outer walls of the silken palace were stones and
tiny boulders discarded fragments of former meals
and the gutted armor from limbs of ancient prey
but what caused burl to know the place most surely
and most tembly was another decoration that

dangled from the castle of this insect ogre this
was the shrunken dessicated figure of a man all its
juices extracted and the life gone

  the death of that man had saved burls life two
years before they had been together seeking a
new source of edible mushrooms for food the
clotho spider was a hunter not a spinner of snares
it sprang suddenly from behind a great puff-ball
and the two men froze in terror then it came
swiftly forward and deliberately chose its victim
burl had escaped when the other man was seized
now he looked meditatively at the hiding-place of
his ancient enemy some day-

  but now he passed on he went past the thicket
in which the great moths hid during the day and
past the pool-a turgid thing of slime and yeast-
in which a monster water-snake lurked he pene-
trated the little wood of the shining mushrooms
that gave out light at night and the shadowed place
where the truffle-hunting beetles went chirping
thunderously during the dark hours

  and then he saw saya he caught a flash of pink
skin vanishing behind the thick stalk of a squat
toadstool and ran forward calling her name she
appeared and saw the figure with the horrible bulk
of the spider upon its back she cried out in hor-
ror and burl understood he let his burden fall
and went swiftly toward her

  they met saya waited timidly until she saw who
this man was and then astonishment went over her
face gorgeously attired in an iridescent cloak
from the whole wing of a great moth with a strip
of softest fur from a night-flying creature about
his middle with golden feathery antennse bound
upon his forehead and a fierce spear in his hands
-this was not the burl she had known

  but then he moved slowly toward her filled with
a fierce delight at seeing her again thrilling with
joy at the slender gracefulness of her form and the
dark richness of her tangled hair he held out his
hands and touched her shyly then manlike he be-
gan to babble excitedly of the things that had hap-
pened to him and dragged her toward his great
victim the gray-bellied spider

  saya trembled when she saw the furry bulk lying
upon the ground and would have fled when burl
advanced and took it up upon his back then
something of the pride that filled him came vicar-
iously to her she smiled a flashing smile and
burl stopped short in his excited explanation he
was suddenly tongue-tied his eyes became plead-
ing and soft he laid the huge spider at her feet
and spread out his hands imploringly

  thirty thousand years of savagery had not les-
sened the feminity in saya she became aware
that burl was her slave that these wonderful things
he wore and had done were as nothing if she did not
approve she drew away-saw the misery in burls
face-and abruptly ran into his arms and clung to
him laughing happily and quite suddenly burl
saw with extreme clarity that all these things he
had done even the slaying of a great spider were
of no importance whatever beside this most won-
derful thing that had just happened and told saya
so quite humbly but holding her very close to him
as he did so

  and so burl came back fa his tribe he had
left it neal-ly naked with but a wisp of moth-wing
the mad planet

twisted about his middle a timid fearful trembling
creature he returned in triumph walking slowly
and fearlessly down a broad lane of golden mush-
rooms toward the hiding place of his people

  upon his shoulders was draped a great and many-
colored cloak made from the whole of a moths wing
soft fur was about his middle a spear was in his

hand and a fierce club at his waist he and saya
bore between them the dead body of a huge spider
-aforetime the dread of the pink-skinned naked
men

  but to burl the most important thing of all was
that saya walked beside him openly acknowledging
him before all the tribe

 the first men
     in the moon

by h g wells

this is undoubtedly one of the greatest moon stories evei
written what sort of beings is it possible for the moon
to harbor we know that the moon has but very little
atmosphere and we also know that it is almost impossible for
any sort of living organisms to maintain themselves on the
surface of our satellite we also know the moon to be a dead
world this means that its interior probably is composed of
tremendous grottoes and cavities if there was any atmosphere
at any time it probably is now contained in the interior of the
moon what sort of beings can inhabit this dead world it
is safe to say that only a wells could think of the most amazing
creatures that he describes so vividly but somehow or other
you gain the impression that it is all very true dont fail to read
this extraordinary and amazing story
author o  leagues under the sea etc

despair galvanized mo i threw myself upon the madman we struggled together and a terrible conflict took place but i was thrown
down and while he hold mo under his lenoe the madman was cutting tho cords of tho cor  tho car fell but i instinctively
clung to tho cords and hoisted myself into the meshes of the netting
a dama in the air



n the month of september - i ar-
rived at frankfort-on-the-main my
passage through the principal german
cities had been brilliantly marked by
balloon ascents but as yet no german
had accompanied me in my car and the fine experi-
ments made at paris by mm greene eugene god-
ard and poitevin had not tempted the grave teutons
to essay aerial voyages

  eut scarcely had the news of my approaching
ascent spread through frankfort than three of
the principal citizens begged the favor of being
allowed to ascend with me two days afterwards
we were to start from the place de la comedie i
began at once to get my balloon ready it was of
silk prepared with gutta percha and its volume
which was three thousand cubic yards enabled it to
ascend to the loftiest heights

  the day of the ascent was that of the great sep-
tember fair which attracts so many people to
frankfort lighting gas of perfect quality and
great lifting power had been furnished me and
about eleven oclock the balloon was filled but only
three-quarters filled-an indispensable precaution
for as one rises the atmosphere diminishes in den-
sity and the fluid enclosed within the balloon ac-
quiring more elasticity might burst its sides my
calculations told me exactly the quantity of gas
necessary to carry up my companions and myself

  we were to start at noon the impatient crowd
which pressed around the enclosed square over-
flowing into the contiguous streets and covering
the houses from the ground-floor to the slated
gables presented a striking scene

  i carried three hundred pounds of ballast in bags
the car quite round four feet in diameter was
comfortably arranged the hempen cords which sup-
ported it stretched symmetrically over the upper
hemisphere of the balloon the compass was in place
the barometer suspended in the circle which united
the supporting cords and the anchor put in order
all was now ready for
the ascent

  among those who press-
ed around the enclosure

i remarked a young man
with a pale face and agi-
tated features the sight
of him impressed me

he was an eager specta-
tor of my ascents whom i
had already met in sev-
eral german cities with
an uneasy air he closely
watched the curious
machine as it lay motionless a few feet above the
ground and he remained silent among those about
him

  twelve oclock came the moment had arrived
but my traveling companions did not appear

  i sent to their houses and learnt that one had
left for hamburg another for vienna and the third
for london their courage had failed them at un-
dertaking one of those excursions which thanks to
the improvement in aeronautics are free from all
danger as they formed in some sort a part of the
programme of the day the fear had seized them

that they might be forced to execute it faithfully
and they had fled far from the scene at the instant
when the balloon was being filled their heroism
was evidently in inverse ratio to their speed-in
decamping

  the multitude half deceived showed not a little
ill humor i did not hesitate to ascend alone in
order to re-establish the equilibrium between the
specific gravity of the balloon and the weight which
had thus proved wanting i replaced my companions
by more sacks of sand and got into the car the
twelve men who had held the balloon by twelve cords
let these slip a little between their fingers and the
balloon rose several feet higher there was not a
breath of wind and the atmosphere was so laden
that it seemed to forbid the ascent

  is everything ready i cried

  the men put themselves in readiness a last
glance told me that i might go attention

  there was a movement in the crowd which seem-
ed to be invading the enclosure

  let go

  the balloon rose slowly but i experienced a shock
which threw me to the bottom of the car

  when i got up i found myself face to face with
an unexpected fellow-voyager-the pale young
man

  monsieur i salute you said he with utmost
coolness

  by what right-

  am i here by the right which the impossi-
bility of your getting rid of me confers

  i was amazed his calmness put me out of coun-
tenance and i had nothing to reply i looked at the
intruder but he took no notice of my astonishment

  does my weight disarrange your equilibrium
monsieur he asked you will permit me- and
without waiting consent he picked up two bags and
emptied them into space

monsieur said i taking the only course now
possible you have come very well you will re-
 main but to me alone be-
longs the management of
the balloon

  monsieur said he
your urbanity is french
all over it comes from
my country i morally
press the hand you refuse
me make all precautions
and act as seems best to
you i will wait till you

have done-

  for what

  to talk with you

  the barometer had fallen to twenty-six inches
we were nearly six hundred yards from the city
but nothing betrayed the horizontal displacement of
the balloon for the mass of air in which it is en-
closed goes forward with it a sort of confused
glow enveloped the objects spread out under us and
fortunately obscured their outline

  i examined my companion afresh he was a man
of thirty years simply clad the sharpness of his
features betrayed an indomitable energy and he
seemed very muscular indifferent to the astonish-
ment he created he remained motionless trying in

was one of the very first stories published by

   our well-known author appearing soon after 
it is perhaps not of the fine quality of some of vernes
later works but it is a little gem in itself because with-
out a doubt it holds your interest short as it is has
plenty of excitement and a good deal of action more-
over it is not only probable but in a newspaper account
some years ago the identical thing happened in a slightly
different setting it probably will happen again we
know that you will like a drama in the air


amazing stories

the meantime to distinguish the objects below us
  miserable mist said he after a few moments
  i did not reply

  you owe me a grudge he went on bah i
could not pay for my journey and it was necessary
to take you by surprise

  nobody asks you to descend monsieur

  eh do you not know then that the same thing
happened to the counts of laurencin and dam-
pierre when they ascended at lyons on the th
of january  a young merchant named fon-
taine scaled the gallery at the risk of capsizing the
machine he accomplished the journey and nobody
died of it

  once on the ground -we will have an explana-
tionreplied i piqued at the light tone in which he
epolce

  bah do not let us think of our return

  do you think then i shall not hasten to de-
scend

  descend said he in surprise descend let
us begin by first ascending

  and before i could prevent it two more bags had
been thrown out of the car without even having
been emptied

  monsieur cried i in a rage

  i know your ability replied the unknown quietly
ly and your fine ascents are famous but if ex-
perience is the sister of practice she is also a cousin
of theory and i have studied the aerial art long
it has got into my head he added sadly falling
into a silent reverie

  the balloon having risen some distance farther
now become stationary the unknown consulted
the barometer and said here we are at eight
hundred yards men are like insects see i
think we should always contemplate them from this
height to judge correctly of their proportions the
place de la comdie is transformed into an im-
mense ant-hill observe the crowd which is gather-
ed on the quays and the mountains also get smaller
and smaller we are over the cathedral the
main is only a line cutting the city in two and the
bridge seems a thread thrown between the two
banks of the river

  the atmosphere became somewhat chilly

  there is nothing i would not do for you my
host said the unknown if you are cold i will
take off my coat and lend it to you

  thanks said i dryly

  bah necessity makes law give me your
hand i am your fellow-countryman you will learn
something in my company and my conversation will
indemnify you for the trouble i have given you

  i sat down without replying at the opposite ex-
tremity of the car the young man drew a volumi-
nous manuscript from his coat it was an essay on
ballooning

  i possess said he the most curious collection
of engravings and caricatures extant concerning
aerial manias how people admired and scoffed at
the same time at this precious discovery we are
happily no longer in the age in which montgolfier
tried to make artificial clouds with steam or a gas
having electrical properties produced by the com-
bustion of moist straw and chopped-up-wool

  do you wish to depreciate the talent of the in-

ventors i asked for i had resolved to enter into
the adventure was it not good to have proved by
experience the possibility of rising in the air

  ah monsieur who denies the glory of the first
aerial navigators it required immense courage to
rise by means of those frail envelopes which only
contained heated air but i ask you has the aerial
science made great progress since blanchards as-
censions that is since nearly a century ago look
here monsieur

  the unknown took an engraving from his port-
folio

  here said he is the first aerial voyage un-
dertaken by pilatre des hosiers and the marquis
darlandes four months after the discovery of bal-
loons louis xvi refused to consent to the venture
and two men who were condemned to death were
the first to attempt the aerial ascent pilatre des
hosiers became indignant at this injustice and by
means of intrigues obtained permission to make the
experiment the car which renders the manage-
ment easy had not been invented and a circular
gallery was placed around the lower and contracted
part of the montgolfier balloon the two aeronauts
must then remain motionless at each extremity of
this gallery for the moist straw which filled it for-
bade them all motion a chafing-dish with fire was
suspended below the orifice of the balloon when the
aeronauts wished to rise they threw straw upon
this brazier at the risk of setting fire to the balloon
and the aiz more heated acquired fresh ascending
power the two bold travelers rose on the st of
november  from the muette gardens which
the dauphin had put at their disposal the balloon
went up majestically passed over the isle of swans
crossed the seine at the conference barrier and
drifting between the dome of the invalides and the
military school approached the church of saint
sulpice then the aeronauts added to the fire
crossed the boulevard and descended beyond the
enfer barrier as it touched the soil the balloon
collapsed and for a few moments buried pilatre des
rosiers under it folds

  unlucky augury i said interested in the story
which affected me nearly

  an augury of the catastrophe which was later
to cost this unfortunate man his life x-eplied the
unknown sadly have you never experienced any-
thing like it

  never

  bah misfortunes sometimes occur unfore-
shadowed added my companion he then remain-
ed silent	- -

  we were drifting southward and frankfort had
already passed from beneath us

  perhaps we shall have a storm said the young
man

  we shall descend before that i replied

  better to ascend we shall escape it more
surely and two more bags of sand were hurled
into space

  the balloon rose rapidly and stopped at twelve
hundred yards i became colder and yet the suns
rays falling upon the surface expanded the gas
within and gave it a greater ascending force

fear nothing said the unknown we have

a drama in the air



still three thousand five hundred fathoms of breath-
ing air besides do not trouble yourself about
what i do

  i would have risen but a vigorous hand held me
to my seat your name i asked

  my name what matters it to you

  i demand your name

  my name is erostratus or empedocles which-
ever you choose

  this reply was far from reassuring the un-
known besides talked with such strange coolness
that i anxiously asked myself whom i had to deal
with

  monsieur he continued nothing original has
been imagined since the physicist charles four
months after the discovery of balloons this man had
invented the valve which permits the gas to escape
when the balloon is too full or when you wish to
descend the car which aids the management of the
machine the netting which holds the envelope of
the balloon and divides the weight over its whole
surface the ballast which enables you to ascend
and to choose the place of your landing the india-
rubber coating which renders the tissue imperme-
able the barometer which shows the height at-
tained lastly charles used hydrogen which four-
teen times lighter than air permits you to penetrate
to the highest atmospheric regions and does not ex-
pose you to the dangers of a combustion in the air
on the st of december  three hundred thous-
and spectators were crowded around the tuilleries
charles rose and the soldiers presented arms to
him ho traveled nine leagues in the air conduct-
ing his balloon with an ability not surpassed by
modern aeronauts the king awarded him a pen-
sion of two thousand livres for then they encour-
aged new inventions

  the unknown now seemed to be under tho
influence of considerable agitation

  see there is darmstadt said he leaning over
the car do you perceive the chateau not very
distinctly eh what would you have the heat of
the storm makes the outline of objects waver and
you must have a skilled eye to recognize localities
are you certain it is darmstadt i asked

  i am sure of it we are now six leagues from
frankfort

  then we must descend

  descend you would not go down on the
steeples said the unknown with a chuckle

  no but the suburbs of the city

  well let us avoid tho steeples

  so speaking my companion seized some bags of
ballast i hastened to prevent him but he over-
threw me with one hand and the unballasted bal-
loon ascended to two thousand yards

  rest easy said he and do not forget that
brioschi biot gay-lussac bixio and barral as-
cended to still greater heights to make their scien-
tific experiments

  monsieur we must descend i resumed trying
to persuade him by gentleness the storm is gath-
ering around us it would be more prudent-

  bah we will mount higher than the storm and
then we shall no longer fear itcried my companion
what is nobler than to overlook the clouds which
oppress the earth is it not an honor thus to navi-

gate on aerial billows the greatest men have
traveled as we are doing the marchioness and
countess de montalembert the countess of podenas
mademoiselle la garde the marquis de montalem-
bert rose from the faubourg saint-antoine for
these unknown regions and the duke de chartres
exhibited much skill and presence of mind in his
ascent on the th of july  at lyons the
counts of laurencin and dampierre at nantes m
de luynes at bordeaux darbelet des granges in
italy the chevalier andreani in our own time the
duke of brunswick-have all left traces of their
glory in the air to equal these great personages
we must penetrate still higher than they into the
celestial depths to approach the infinite is to
comprehend it

  the rarefaction of the air was fast expending tho
hydrogen in the balloon and i saw its lower part
purposely left empty swell out so that it was abso-
lutely necessary to open the valve but my compan-
ion did not seem to intend that i should manage the
balloon as i wished i then resolved to pull the
valve-cord secretly as he was excitedly talking for
i feared to guess with whom i had to deal it would
have been too horrible it was nearly a quarter be-
fore one we had been gone forty minutes from
frankfort heavy clouds were coming against the
wind from the south and seemed about to burst
upon us

  have you lost all hope of succeeding in your
project i asked with anxious interest

  all hope exclaimed the unknown in a low voice
wounded by slights and caricatures these asses
kicks have finished me it is the eternal punish-
ment reserved for innovators look at these carica-
tures of all periods of which my portfolio is full

  while my companion was fumbling with his
papers i had seized the valve-cord without his per-
ceiving it i feared however that he might hear
the hissing noise like a water-course which the gas
makes in escaping

  how many jokes were made about the abb
moilan said he he was to go up with janninet
and bredin during the filling their balloon caught
fire and the ignorant populace tore it to pieces
then this caricature of curious animals appeared
giving each of them a punning nickname

  i pulled the valve-cord and the barometer began
to ascend it was time some far-off rumblings
were heard in the south

  here is another engraving resumed the un-
known not suspecting what i was doing it is an
immense balloon carrying a ship strong castles
houses and so on the caricaturists did not sus-
pect that their follies would one day become truths
it is complete this large vessel on the left is its
helm with the pilots box at the prow are pleasure-
houses an immense organ and a cannon to call the
attention of the inhabitants of the earth or the
moon above the poop there are the observatory and
the balloon longboat in the equatorial circle the
army barrack on the left the funnel then the up-
per galleries for promenading sails pinions below
the cafs and general storehouse observe this
pompous announcement invented for the happiness
of the human race this globe will depart at once for
the ports of the levant and on its return the pro-


amazing stories

gramme of its voyages to the two poles and the ex-
treme west will be announced no one need furnish
himself with anything everything is foreseen and
all will prosper thus pleasure will be the soul of
the aerial company all this provoked laughter
but before long if i am not cut off they will see it
all realized

  we were visibly descending he did not perceive
itl

  this kind of game at balloons he resumed
spreading out before me some of the engravings of
his valuable collection this game contains the en-
tire history of the aerostatic art it is used by
elevated minds and displayed with dice and coun-
ters with whatever stakes you like to be paid or
received according to where the player arrives
why said i you seem to have studied the
science of aerostation profoundly

  yes monsieur yes from phaeton icarus
architas i have searched for examined learnt
everything i could render immense services to the
world in this art if god granted me life but that
will not be

  why

  because my name is empedocles or erostratus
meanwhile the balloon was happily approaching
the earth but when one is falling the danger is as
great at a hundred feet as at five thousand

  do you recall the battle of fleurus resumed
my companion whose face became more and more
animated it was at that battle that contello by
order of the government organized a company of
balloonists at the siege of maubeuge general jour-
dan derived so much service from this new method
of observation that contello ascended twice a day
with the general himself the communications be-
tween the aeronaut and his agents who held the
balloon were made by means of small white red
and yellow flags often the gun and cannon shot
were directed upon the balloon when he ascended
but without result where general jourdan was
preparing to invest charleroi contello went to the
vicinity ascended from the plain of jumet and con-
tinued his observations for seven or eight hours
witih general morlot and this no doubt aided in
giving us the victory of fleurus general jourdan
publicly acknowledged the help which the aeronau-
tical observations had afforded him well despite
the services rendered on that occasion and during
the belgian campaign the year which had seen the
beginning of the military career of balloons saw
also its end the school of meudon founded by the
government was closed by buonaparte on his re-
turn from egypt and now what can you expect
from the new-born infant as franklin said the
infant was born alive it should not be stifled
the unknown bowed his head in his hands for
some moments then rousing himself he said des-
pite my prohibition monsieur you have opened the
valve

  i dropped the cord

  happily he resumed we have still three hun-
dred pounds of ballast

  what is your purpose said i

  have you ever crossed the seas  he asked

  i turned pale

  it is unfortunate he went on that we are be-

ing driven towards the adriatic that is only a
stream but higher up we may find other currents
and without any notice of me he threw over
several bags of sand then in a menacing voice he
said i let you open the valve because the expand-
ing gas threatened to burst the balloon but do not
do it again

  then we went on you remember the voyage of
blanchard and jeffries from dover to calais it
was magnificent on the th of january 
there being a north-west wind their balloon was in-
flated with gas on the dover coast a mistake of
equilibrium just as they were ascending forced
them to throw out their ballast so that they might
not go down again and they only kept thirty pounds
it was too little for as the wind did not freshen
they only advanced very slowly towards the french
coast besides the permeability of the tissue
served to reduce the inflation little by little and in
an hour and a half the aeronauts perceived that
they were descending

   what shall we do said jeffries

   we are only one quarter of the way over re-
plied blanchard and very low down on rising we
shall perhaps meet more favorable winds

   let us throw out the rest of the sand

  the balloon acquired some ascending force but
it soon began to descend again towards the mid-
dle of the transit the aeronauts threw over their
books and tools a quarter of an hour after
blanchard said to jeffries the barometer

   it is going up we are lost and yet there is
the french coast

  a loud noise was heard

   has the balloon burst asked jeffries

   no the loss of the gas has reduced the in-
flation of the lower part of the balloon but we
are still descending we are lost out with every-
thing useless

  provisions oars and rudder were thrown into
the sea the aeronauts were only one hundred
yards high

  we are going up again said the doctor

   no it is the spurt caused by the diminution
of the weight and not a ship in sight not a bark on
the horizon to the sea with our clothing

  the unfortunates stripped themselves but the
balloon continued to descend

   blanchard said jeffries you should have made
this voyage alone you consented to take me i will
sacrifice myself i shall drop into the water and
the balloon relieved of my weight will mount
again

  no no it is frightful

  the balloon became less and less inflated and as
it doubled up its concavity pressed the gas against
the sides and hastened its downward course

   adieu said the doctor god preserve you
he was about to throw himself over when
blanchard held him back

   there is one more chance said he we can cut
the cords which hold the car and cling to the net
perhaps the balloon will rise let us hold ourselves
ready but-the barometer is going down the
wind is freshening we are saved

  the aeronauts preceived calais their joy was
delirious a few momanfo more and they had
a drama in the air



fallen in the forest of guines i do not doubt
added the unknown that under similar circum-
stances you would have followed doctor jeffries
example

  the clouds rolled in glittering masses beneath us
the balloon threw large shadows on them and
was surrounded as by an aureola the thunder
rumbled below the car all this was terrifying

  let us descend i cried

  descend when the sun is up there waiting for
us out with more bags

  and more than fifty pounds of ballast were cast
over

  at a height of three thousand five hundred yards
we remained stationary thc unknown talked un-
ceasingly i was in a state of complete prostration
while he seemed to be in his element with a good
wind we shall go far he cried in the antilles
there are currents of air which have a speed of a
hundred leagues an hour when napoleon was
crowned garnerin sent up a balloon with colored
lamps at eleven oclock at night the wind was
blowing north-north-west the next morning at
daybreak the inhabitants of rome greeted its pass-
age over the dome of st peters we shall go far-
ther and higher

  i scarcely heard him everything whirled around
me an opening appeared in the clouds

  see that city said the unknown it is spires

  i leaned over the car and perceived a small black-
ish mass it was spires the rhine which is so
large seemed an unrolled ribbon the sky was a
deep blue over our heads the birds had long aban-
doned us for in that rarefied air they could not have
flown we were alone in space and i in the pres-
ence of this unknown

  it is useless for you to know whither i am lead-
ing you he said as he threw the compass among
thc clouds ah a fall is a grand thing you
know that but few victims of ballooning are to be
reckoned from pilatre des rosiers to lieutenant
gale and that the accidents have always been the
result of imprudence pilatre des rosiers set out
with romain of boulogne on the th of june
 to his gas balloon he had affixed a mont-
golfier apparatus of hot air so as to dispense no
doubt with the necessity of losing gas or throwing
out ballast it was putting a torch under a powder-
barrel when they had ascended four hundred
yards and were taken by opposing winds they were
driven over the open sea pilatre in order to des-
cend essayed to open the valve but the valve-cord
became entangled in the balloon and tore it so badly
that it became empty in an instant it fell upon
the montgolfier apparatus overturned it and drag-
ged down the unfortunates who were soon shattered
to pieces it is frightful is it not

  i could only reply for pitys sake let us des-
cend 

  the clouds gathered around us on every side
and dreadful detonations which reverberated in
the cavity of the balloon took place beneath us

  you provoke me cried the unknown and you
shall no longer know whether we are rising or fall-
ing

  the barometer went the way of the compass ac-
companied by several more bags of sand we must

have been  yards high some icicles had al-
ready attached themselves to the sides of the car
and a kind of fine snow seemed to penetrate to my
very bones meanwhile a frightful tempest was
raging under us but wte were above it

  do not be afraid said the unknown it is
only the imprudent who are lost olivari who
perished at orleans rose in a paper montgolfier 
his car suspended below the chafing-dish and bal-
lasted with combustible materials caught fire
olivari fell and was killed mosment rose at
lille on a light tray an oscillation disturbed hi
equilibrium mosment fell and was killed bittorf
at mannheim saw his balloon catch fire in the air
and he too fell and was killed harris rose in a
badly constructed balloon the valve of which wa
too large and would not shut harris fell and was
killed  sadler deprived of ballast by his long so-
journ in the air was dragged over the town of
boston and dashed against the chimneys sadler
fell and was killed cokling descended with a
convex parachute which he pretended to have per-
fected cokling fell and was killed well i love
them these victims of their own imprudence and
i shall die as they did higher still higher

  all the phantoms of this necrology passed before
my eyes the rarefaction of the air and the suns
rays added to the expansion of the gas and the
balloon continued to mount i tried to open the
valve but the unknown cut the cord several feet
above my head i was lost

  did you see madame blanchard fall said he
i saw her yes i i was at tivoli on the th of
july  madame blanchard rose in a small-
sized balloon to avoid the expense of filling and
she was forced to inflate it entirely the gas leaked
out below and left a regular train of hydrogen in
its path she carried with her a sort of pyrotechnic
aureola suspended below her car by a wire which
she was to set off in the air this she had don
many times before on this day she also carried up
a small parachute ballasted by a firework contri-
vance that would go off in a shower of silver she
was to start this contrivance after having lighted
it with a port-fire made on purpose she set out
the night was gloomy at the moment of lighting
her fireworks she was so imprudent as to pass the
taper under the column of hydrogen which was
leaking from the balloon my eyes were fixed upon
her suddenly an unexpected gleam lit up the
darkness i thought she was preparing a surprise
the light flashed out suddenly disappeared and re-
appeared and gave the summit of the balloon tho
shape of an immense jet of ignited gas this
sinister glow shed itself over the boulevard and the
whole montmarrte quarter then i saw the unhappy
woman rise try twice to close the appendage of
the balloon so as to put out the fire then sit down
in her car and try to guide her descent for she did
not fall the combustion of the gas lasted for
several minutes the balloon becoming gradually
less continued to descend but it was not a fall tho
wind blew from the north-west and drove it towards
paris there were then some large gardens just
by the house no  rue de provence madame
blanchard essayed to fall there without danger but
the balloon and the car struck on the roof of the


amaztng stories

house with a light shock save me cried the
wretched woman i got into the street at this
moment the car slid along the roof and en-
countered an iron cramp madame blanchard was
thrown out of her car and precipitated upon the
pavement she was killed

  these stories froze me with horror the un-
known was standing with bare head disheveled
hair haggard eyes there was no longer any il-
lusion possible i recognized the horrible truth
i was in the presence of a madman

  he threw out the rest of the ballast and we must
have now reached a height of at least nine thou-
sand yards blood spurted from my nose and
mouth

  who are nobler than the martyrs of science
cried the lunatic they are canonized by poster-
ity

  but i no longer heard him he bent down to my
ear and muttered and have you forgotten zam-
becarris catastrophe listen on the th of
october  the clouds seemed to lift a little on
the preceding days the wind and rain had not
ceased but the announced ascension of zambecarri
could not be postponed his enemies were already
bantering him it was necessary to ascend to save
the science and himself from becoming a public
jest it was at boulogne no one helped him to
inflate his balloon he rose at midnight accom-
panied by andreoli and grossetti the balloon
mounted slowly for it had been perforated by the
rain and the gas was leaking out the three in-
trepid aeronauts could only observe the state of the
barometer by aid of a dark lantern zambecarri
had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours grossetti
was also fasting

   my friends said zambecarri i am overcome
by cold and exhausted i am dying

  he fell inanimate in the gallery it was tho
same with grossetti andreoli alone remained con-
scious after long efforts he succeeded in re-
viving zambecarri

  what news whither are we going how is
the wind what time is it

   it is two oclock

   where is the compass

   upset

   great god the lantern has gone out

   it cannot burn in this rarefied air said zam-
becarri

  the moon had not risen and the atmosphere was
plunged in murky darkness i am cold andreoli
what shall i do

  they slowly descended through a layer of
whitish clouds sh said andreoli do you hear
 what asked zambecarri

   a strange noise

   you are mistaken consider these travelers m
the middle of the night listening to that unaccount-
able noise are they going to knock against a
tower are they about to be precipitated on the
roofs do you hear one would say it was the
sea

   impossible

   it is the groaning of the waves

    it is true

  lighti light after five fruitless attempts

andreoli succeeded in obtaining light it was three
oclock

  the noise of violent waves was heard they
were almost touching the surface of the sea we
are lost cried zambecarri seizing a bag of sand

   help cried andreoli

  the car touched the water and the waves came
up to their breasts throw out the instruments
clothes

  the aeronauts completely stripped themselves
the balloon relieved rose with frightful rapidity
zambecarri was taken with vomiting grossetti
bled profusely the unfortunate men could not
speak so short was their breathing they were
taken with cold and they were soon crusted over
with ice the moon looked as red as blood

  after traversing the high regions for a half-
hour the balloon again fell into the sea it was
four in the morning they were half submerged
in the water and the balloon dragged them along
as if under sail for several hours

  at daybreak they found themselves opposite
pesaro four miles from the coast they were
about to reach it when a gale blew them back into
the open sea they were lost the frightened
boats fled at their approach happily a more intel-
ligent boatman accosted them hoisted them on
board and they landed at ferrada

  a frightful journey was it not but zam-
becarri was a brave and energetic man scarcely
recovered from his sufferings he resumed his as-
censions during one of them he struck against
a tree his spirit-lamp was broken on his clothes
he was enveloped in fire his balloon began to catch
the flames and he came down half consumed

  at last on the st of september  he made
another ascension at boulogne the balloon clung
to a tree and his lamp again set it on fire zam-
becarri fell and was killed and in presence of
these facts we would still hesitate no the
higher we go the more glorious will be our death

  the balloon being now entirely relieved of ballast
and of all it contained we were carried to an enor-
mous height it vibrated in the atmosphere the
least noise resounded in the vaults of heaven our
globe the only object which caught my view in
immensity seemed ready to be annihilated and
above us the depths of the starry skies were lost
in thick darkness

  i saw my companion rise up before me

  the hour is come he said we must die we
are rejected of men they despise us we will
not endure it let us crush them

  mercy i cried

  let us cut these cords let this car be abandon-
ed in space the attractive force will change its
direction and we shall approach the sun

  despair galvanized me i threw myself upon the
madman we struggled together and a terrible con-
flict took place but i was thrown down and while
he held me under his knee the madman was cutting
the cords of the car one he cried

  my god

  two three

  i made a superhuman effort rose up and vio-
lently repulsed the madman
a drama in the aik



  four the car fell but i instinctively clung
to the cords and hoisted myself into the meshes
of the netting

  the madman disappeared in space

  the balloon rose to an immeasurable height
a horrible cracking was heard the gas too much

dilated had burst the balloon i shut my eyes-

  some instants after a damp warmth revived
me i was in the midst of clouds on fire the
balloon turned over with dizzy velocity taken by
the wind it made a hundred leagues an hour in a
horizontal course the lightning flashing around it

  meanwhile my fall was not a very rapid one
when i opened my eyes i saw the country i was
two miles from the sea and the tempest was driv-
ing me violently towards it when an abrupt shock
forced me to loosen my hold my hands opened a

the

cord slipped swiftly between my fingers and i
found myself on the solid earth

   it was the cord of the anchor which sweeping
along the surface of the ground was caught in a
crevice and my balloon unballasted for the last
time careered off to lose itself beyond the sea

   when i came to myself i was in bed in a peas-
ants cottage at harderwijk a village of gelder-
land fifteen leagues from amsterdam on the shores
of the zuyder-zee

   a miracle had saved my life but my voyage had
been a series of imprudences committed by a
lunatic and i had not been able to prevent them

   may this terrible narrative though instructing
those who read it not discourage the explorers of
the air

end

 stars

 out through space my spirit leaps

 swifter far than light

 up to the lunar craters

 gilded banked with night

 over the channeled ruddy mars

 up through saturns rings

 parting the hair of comets

 on my spirit wings

 out where vast and awful voids
 space the milky way-

 room for earths by hundreds
 to spin the night and day

 straight through stuff of orbs unborn
 mammoth nebula

 lost where stars by thousands
 light the ether sea

 far in timeless bournless space
 till systems cease to roll

 ever vainly seeking
 hope and the supersoul

 millions die who never knew
 half i see and ken

 while i circle madly
 through the stars and then-

 back to earth my spirit falls

 tired of cosmic dust

 needing a human being

 human love and trust

 gliding down on fancys wings
 deep among the hills

 where the elms and maples
 arch the flowered rills

 back to dark-haired mirabel
 all my being flies

 back to a wide-arm welcome
 and the cosmos of her eyes

the second deluge

  icontinued from page 

  the ark and shook it to its center and
  while new york a few miles away
  saw story after story buried under
  waters crowded cosmos brilliantly
  lighted saloon and raised their voices
  to a high pitch in order to be heard

    had all the invitations which he
 dictated to joseph smith after their
 memorable discussion and which were
 sent forth in the utmost haste flying
 to every point of the compass been
 accepted and was it the famous lead-
 ers of science the rulers and crowned
 heads who had passed his critical in-
 spection that were now knocking el-
 bows under the great dome of levium
 had kings and queens stolen incog-
 nito under the shelter of the ark and
 magnates of the financial world hidden
 themselves there

    it would have been well for them
 all if they had been there but in
 fact many of those to whom the invi-
 tations had gone did not even take the
 trouble to thank their would-be savior
 a few however who did not come in
 person sent responses among these
 was the president of the united
 states mr samsons letter was brief
 but characteristic it read

   to cosmo versal esq
 isir

      the president directs me to
   say that he is grateful for your
   invitation and regrets that he
   cannot accept it he is informed
   by those to whose official advice
   he feels bound to listen that the
   recent extraordinary events pos-
   sess no such significance as you
   attach to them

respectfully

            james jenks secretary

   it must be remembered that this
 letter was written before the oceanic
 overflow began after that possibly
 the president and his advisers changed
 their opinion but then communica-
 tion by rail was cut off and as soon
 as the downpour from the sky com-
 menced the aero express lines were
 abandoned the air-ships would have
 been deluged and blown to destruc-
 tion by the tremendous gusts which
 at intervals packed the rain-choked
 air itself into solid billows of water

    none of the rulers of the old world
  responded but about half the men of
  science and representatives of the
  other classes that cosmo had set down

real money in
the bank

   think of it nell- and to think
 that just a few months ago we couldnt save
 a ccnt

    remember the night we talked it over
  and you persuaded me to send in that i c s
  coupon it was the best investment we

amazing stories

  on his list were wise enough to accept
  and they hurried to new york before
  the means of transit by land and sea
  were destroyed

   among these were englishmen
  frenchmen italians spaniards ger-
  mans austrians poles people from
  the balkan states swedes danes
  russians and a few from india china
  and japan the clatter of their vari-
  ous tongues made a very babel inside
  the ark when they talked to one an
  other in groups but nearly all of them
  were able to speak english which
  after many years of experiment has
  been adopted as the common language
  for transacting the worlds affairs

    there was another letter which
  cosmo read with real regret although
  hardly with surprise it was from
  professor pludder instead of ex-
  pressing gratitude for the invitation
  as the president trained in political
  blandiloquence had done professor
  pludder indulged in denunciation

    you are insane he said you
  do not know what you are talking
  about your letter is an insult to
  science these inundations this
  too was written before the sky had
  opened its flood-gates are perfectly
  explicable by the ordinary laws of
  nature your talk of a nebula is so
  ridiculous that it deserves no reply
  if any lunatic accepts your absurd in-
  vitation and goes into your ark he
  will find himself in bedlam where he
  ought to be

    i guess you were right cosmo
  remarked to joseph smith after read-
  ing this outburst pludder would not
  contribute to the regeneration of man-
  kind we are better off without him

    but cosmo versal was mistaken in
  thinking he had heard the last of abiel
  pludder the latter was destined to
  show that he was hardly a less re-
  markable specimen of homo sapiens
  than the big-headed prophet of the
  second deluge himself

    as soon as it became evident that
  there would be room to spare in the
  ark cosmo set at work to fill up the
  list he went over his categories once
  more but now owing to the pressure
  of time he was obliged to confine his
  selections to persons within easy
  reach they came nearly all from
  new york or its vicinity and since
  these last invitations went out just
  on the eve of the events described in
  the last two chapters there was no
  delay in the acceptances and the in-
  vitees promptly presented themselves
  in person
