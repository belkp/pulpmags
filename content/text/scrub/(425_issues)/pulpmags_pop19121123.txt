 complete novel

chapter i

bound south

a bride and a groom are always
an interesting sight and when
an embarrassed bridal pair
surrounded by a boisterous
score trouped to the steamers side
we already on board had something to
watch besides the shouting and curs-
ing stevedores and sweat-scented long-
shoremen wrestling with huge cases
and hurrying cumbersome trunks into
the vast black interior of the vessels
hold

  the exuberant friends of the newly
married couple had evidently not been
satisfied with thronging the church at
eight in the morning seeing the un-
mathematical process of two made one
but felt that they must invade pier
ib

north river and hurl bon voyage
trite crude and cruel advice along
with handfuls of rice at the confused
and disconcerted two just joined to-
gether until death or the hungry di-
vorce mill would them part

  many interested passengers like my-
self leaned over the rail of the s s
minerva to smile at the laughing noisy
group on the rough boards below us i
dare say every woman who was not
weeping was making mental criticism
of the hang of the brides traveling
skirt or the tilt of her hat such de-
tails were not for my eyes nor were
they for the eyes of the well-set-up
young fellow leaning over the rail to
my left seeing his manifest interest
i spoke

 know them

  no he answered shortly giving
                 


the pocpullcr magazine

me a swift startled look and i knew
he lied

  his back was turned to me and i
could not help noticing the contraction
of the shoulder muscles under his well-
fitting coat when one of the group be-
low emptied a pocketful of rice over
the two who were the center of attrac-
tion

  i distinctly heard the man to my left
mutter an oath

  barbaric custom i ventured to his
broad back do you think they-and
i pointed my cane toward the crowd
below-would act such utter idiots if
they could see themselves as we see
them 

  the man turning abruptly answered
me rather queerly

  oh what-ivhat shall i do he
groaned

  before i could recover from my
amazement he had hurried into the
nearest companionway and once inside
i could hear his voice angrily demand-
ing where the purser could be found

  the hoarse throaty blast of the siren
warning recreant passengers ashore to
get on and thost aboard who were not
sailing to quit the steamer rent the
smoky air with its ear-splitting blast
and i moved nearer the gangplank as
the bride and groom dodging a varied
assortment of old shoes stepped on the
saloon deck

  i stood near while their friends
hurled rice at them and i thought that
the girl looked as some rich luxuriant
flower of the tropics might look in a
snowstorm there was something sweet
and splendid and gracious about her
but as she threw back- her veil i was
struck by the indefinable sadness that
lay in her eyes darkening the clear
gray of them as shadows might darken
the gray of a winter twilight

  but at least the smile on her lips
made up for the pathos of her eyes-
it was like sunlight through a stained-
glass window and when she laughed
one was reminded of all things wonder-
ful in sound

  and laugh she did again and again
as if she knew the sparkle of it warmed
one like wine and remembering that

shadow in her eyes i thought that if
aman can smile and smile and be a
villain a woman can laugh and laugh
and be tragedy incarnate

  oh she was lovely this bride of a
little while and i felt a sudden resent-
ment against the man no matter how
deserving he might be into whose keep-
ing had been given so much of sweet
womanliness

  now remember elizabeth a girls
voice floated up in a sally to the bride
and i was conscious of a feeling of sat-
isfaction elizabeth to me it is the
prettiest name in the whole wide world
-the name itself not any of its hor-
rible contractions such as bertha bess
libbie or lizzie-and as elizabeth i
shall speak of her through these pages
for it is a name i like to voice to think
to write

  some one called a banality to the
groom and my attention was drawn to
him for the first time he was the
usual type of successful business man
with a smile a bit too calculating to be
pleasing and the well-fed prosperous
look that always stirs my antagonism
more than an expression of absolute
villainy he was pretty decently pro
portioned however and decidedlyvell-
groomed and while clothes do not make
the man they have been the unmaking
of many in the eyes of a woman

  theres the spirit of the up-to-date
press for you a tall loosely built
young fellow remarked crowding be-
side me at the railing and pointing to
the group of newspaper photographers
below leveling a battery of cameras at
the bridal couple

  here it is not quite noon and that
enterprising kid at the foot of the gang-
plank is reaping a harvest of pennies
selling the afternoon papers with a
detailed account of the wedding and
half-tone illustrations of the bride as
she entered the church at eight oclock
can you beat it he turned to me
with such an engaging smile andjso
much expansive pride in the eyes which
squinted at me through the pince-nez he
wore that i felt attracted to him in-
stantly

  your innocent enthusiasm over our
the phantom shotgufi



yellow press might make one wonder
what your own profession happens to
be i smiled in return a prize fight-
er a marathon runner an aviator
maybe or an absconding bank cashier
i know that youre nt an actor for i
see nothing that looks like a press
agent

  the young fellow grinned noth-
ing so respectable as any of those he
retorted im merely a common speci-
men of the genus reporter habitat
manhattan species yellowjournalistica
however dont attempt to jump over-
board or anything like that as the
poison has been extracted from my
fangs-im perfectly safe to handle-
warranted not to bite

  i hardly expected to find a reporter
aboard said i my impression was
that they had a hereditary antipathy for
water

  he looked at me reproachfully and
thrust one of his cards toward me upon
which i read

robert l larkins

     tv v evening ledger

  i havent a card with me i said
holding out my hand but im frank
marshall and im very glad to make
your acquaintance i dont care two
bits as a rule to meet people but on
a steamer somehow it is different and
congenial company is half the pleasure
of the journey

  when did you leave the coast
asked the newspaper man falling into
step with me as we made our way for-
ward you see he explained as i
looked at him in surprise only west-
erners sar two bits and i couldnt
help but call the turn

  or rather the analytical mind of a
trained news gatherer got into action
immediately i prompted

  oh anything you like he replied
with a shrug of his shoulders

  our honeymooners seem  to have
been meat for the papers i remarked
drawing from my coat pocket a sheet

bizarre with big type detailing the wed-
ding of the wall street broker and his
erstwhile stenographer i had pur-
chased it out of mere curiosity when the
bridal couple came aboard what
rot i commented disgustedly

  oh i dont know said larkins
lightly think of the hope it gives the
remaining stenographers  approxi-
mately there are seventy-five thousand
of them in new york and about an
equal number of unmarried brokers
and he looked perfectly sober when he
said it

  but this particular sheet i pro-
tested of all the newspapers pub-
lished under the sun i dont know of
one that equals this for mendacity in-
accuracy and sensationalism i cant
see why people buy it

  i can maintained the reporter
you bought one didnt you there
were a half a dozen different papers
sold there yet you chose the one youre
knocking another thing-xyou cant
tell me anything about the ledger be-
cause i work on it he added quietly

  i remembered with chagrin that the
paper i was upbraiding was the ledger
and that his card had borne the name
ofthat journal i started to stammer
an apology but larkins stopped me
good-naturedly

  oh you cant hurt me said he
soak it hammer it knock it-thats
why it grows so fat i suppose you
think that it should run a little four-
line announcement setting forth the
fact that hamilton forbes a well-
known wall street broker married
elizabeth kennedy his stenographer
and that their honeymoon would be
spent in new orleans and the south

  it would be better than this florid
account i maintained

  my dear sir when a penniless man
appears in wall street out of nowhere
and in seven years counts his fortune
with two commas and a period corners
the cotton market marries his beautiful
stenographer making her the richest
bride of the year you demand a four-
line record of the fact  why-why
what do you take the daily press for
he surveyed me wtith an injured air


the vovulacr magazine

  then this-romance as the ledger
has it is true

 m-m-m-m-yes he replied of
course it has been dressed up a bit but
in the main its the straight goods he
added

  the following is a portion of the
ledgers account of the marriage of
hamilton forbes broker and trust
magnate to elizabeth kennedy stenog-
rapher which i insert in recognition of
the fact that it is a far more illuminat-
ing document than i could offer in my
own words

  this morning at eight bruce hamilton
forbes the man who cornered the cotton
market and his stenographer miss eliza-
beth kennedy were quietly married at the
little church around the corner by the
reverend warren beverly

  the romance of the wealthy broker and
his beautiful bride is of unusual interest

  mr forbes career in the street has been
short but meteoric he came to new york
a poor man and in seven short years he
has swept through the golden calf district
like a financial alexander his speculations
have been so paying that he is the most
feared man in wall street to-day

  he is a bachelor with no relatives in this
city but is a member of some of gothams
most select clubs

  miss kennedy gained much newspaper no-
toriety two years ago when she appeared as
the principal witness for the defense in the
trial of e van buren courtlandt a brokers
clerk employed in the forbes offices who
was arrested and tried for stock-market jug-
gling after three trials two resulting in a
jury disagreement the district attorney
quashed further proceedings

  at the time it was rumored that miss
kennedy was the fiancee of the accused who
was a member of one of new yorks old-
est families but after being discharged
courtlandt left new york for the west and
shortly following his death in arizona was
announced

  mr and mrs forbes immediately after
the wedding ceremony sailed for new or-
leans they will spend their honeymoon
traveling through the southern states where
the bridegroom has extensive cotton inter-
ests

  larkins watched me closely and in
silence as i read the ledger s account
which i have robbed of the sensational
features such as the riot of souvenir
hunters at the church speculation as to
what the bridegroom settled on his
bride the intimate story of the court-
ship from the time she first took dicta-

tion from her employer to the hour
wrhen he led her to the altar and such
details as only are found in newspapers
of the ledger s type

  well whats wrong with it he
asked seeing i had finished

  oh nothing i replied to end the
futile argument

  im relieved he said dryly i
wrote it

  just then the trumpeter made his
rounds of the ship calling us in musical
blasts to our first meal aboard

  larkins was staring at the bartholdi
statue of liberty that we were leaving
astern

  do you know he said ive lived
in little old newr york for some ears
and ive never yet paid my respects to
the dear old girl with the torch funny
isnt it  as a kid i longed passionately
for just one thing-to see that statue
and climb up to her crown

  we strolled toward the middle of the
ship after making the pleasant discov-
ery that our staterooms faced each
other and came suddenly on the bridal
couple slowly pacing the deck

  i hate to see such a nice girl mar-
ried to that commented larkins in an
undertone

  why what is wrong with him i
asked surprised to hear the reporter
speak with such animus

  well shes such a fine sort and he
--oh hes a- say do you remem-
ber what we call a fellow out west who
is not up to the mark 

  we principally call him things that
do not look well in print i rejoined

  hes one said the reporter laconi-
cally

  then i told larkins of the clean-cut
young chap wrho watched the bridal
couple with such absorbing interest as
we lay at the wharf and repeated the
curiously wild ejaculation he had di-
rected at me

  there is something that should fire
your newspaper soul i exclaimed-
possibly youll have a mystery to fer-
ret out-that is unless my excited
friend was not a passenger as i sup-
posed and has left the ship

  at that instant as it often happens
the phntm shotgun



in plays and rarely in real life there
stepped out of the companionway the
very man of whom i was speaking

  larkins gripped my shoulder is
that he 

  by all that is wonderful-it is i
managed to gasp how did you know 

  hold fast mr marshall for we are
going round a corner larkins laughed
more than spoke and he took a few
hurried steps forward

  the stranger was just ahead of us
and forbes and his bride were ap-
proaching the two were talking and
it was only when he started to pass the
man in front of us that the bride looked
up

  i have seen people shocked and sur-
prised before but i hope i shall never
again see the look that passed over the
womans face she turned positively
livid

  van she cried her voice barely
above a whisper and with arms
stretched to him she sank in a heap on
the deck

  for a moment forbes stood silent and
tense staring at the young man facing
him then slowly he started to lift his
wife to her feet

  the young fellow sprang forward in
a rage

  dont touch her or by heaven ill
kill you he yelled heaving forbes
back with a violent thrust of both
hands and bending over the fainting
girl he raised her tenderly then turn-
ing asked me to summon the steward-
ess

chapter ii

the first day out

  larkins was not at luncheon when i
took my place i had been given a seat
at the captains table from which van-
tage point i could command a view of
the entire dining saloon and i failed to
locate the reporter at any of the other
tables as i was about to go on deck
the newspaper man came tripping down
the stairs and was shown to the seat
next to mine

  little bit delayed he said as he un-
folded his napkin how do you like
our seats  i fixed em up

  i was looking for you i told him
and was hoping you hadnt fallen a vic-
tim to the sway of the ship

  i never get seasick answered lar-
kins after he had ordered practically
everything on the menu i dont be-
lieve in it-foolish notion for a fellow
to get in his head

  ah theres the trouble mr lar-
kins said i the notion doesnt attack
the head first	t

  larkins smiled and wanted to know
if the bride and groom had appeared at
luncheon

  i explained that the bridegroom had
been down and had seat number four
opposite our chairs which gave me a
good opportunity to observe him close-
ly he was nervous and distraught
scarcely ate anything and left the table
after ordering a few delicacies taken up
to his suite

  you know what got his goat asked
larkins ordering two kinds of pie

  i could guess if i tried real hard
i replied that young fellow who
threatened to kill forbes when mrs
forbes fainted was van buren court-
landt

  yep

  what have you been doing since that
time  i asked as we arose to take a
turn on deck

  cr-r-r-a-a-sh  cr-rash crrash 
cr-r-r-a-a-sh said my companion
imitating the wireless instrument that
was sending its roar throughout the
length and breadth of the ship

  i turned on him in disgust do you
mean to tell me that you have sent what
happened to your paper

  why no of course not i merely
wired them that i had discovered a new
method for making electric lights out
of current magazines he looked me
over as if i were some strange animal in
a zoo

  as we went above he declined the
cigar i offered him for a turkish ciga-
rette which he fished from his pocket

  when we arranged for our steamer
chairs we had them placed on the saloon
deck near the window of my stateroom
where the cabin wall formed a sort of l
of the deck two empty chairs were


the tpocpuljlcr magazine

already there and as ours were being
placed i saw the newspaper man eye the
deck steward rather queerly

  youre a pretty well-set-up fellow
larkins said addressing him i sup-
pose you get all your muscle from toy-
ing with these chairs

  yes sir replied the steward still
busy with the chairs but tossin bag-
gage around is a heap sight better for
grabbin muscle im head baggageman
sides deck steward you know sir

  i guess your arm is twice the size
of mine larkins continued lets
see and he surprised me by peeling off
his coat and rolling up his shirt sleeves
thereby displaying a pair of arms about
as husky as lead pencils whats your
name  he asked

  hallaron sir tom hallaron
well tom lets see how much big-
ger your arms are than mine

  hallaron rolled back his blue flannel
sleeves and held out a pair of hairy
limbs larger than most mens legs

  guess ill have to eat a mixed diet
of elephant steak and hippopotamus
cutlets to get arms that size said lar-
kins putting on his coat again

  try steamer chairs and taylor
trunks sir advised the steward

  i say you young scalawag i
laughed what kind of an exhibition
was that seems to me if i owned a
pair of toothpicks such as you carry
around for arms id keep them in my
coat sleeves

  of course you would said my ec-
centric companion digging his nose
deeper in his magazine leaving me to
mine with no-further comment

  larkins read in silence a stiff
breeze off shore made our overcoats and
steamer rugs very comfortable and as
we stretched out lazily in our chairs i
surreptitiously studied the erratic young
man to whom i had taken such an in-
stant liking his face was well-bred
and intelligent his pronunciation de-
liglfted me but his liberal use of slang
offset the pleasing quality of his voice
and the singular refinement of his fea-
tures it was like hearing syncopated
music played on a harp as he read
page after page of his magazine i

watched his face carefully for some sign
of pleasure or dissatisfaction in what
he was reading but he might have been
chiseled out of stone for all the emotion
he displayed

  as i studied him i speculated on the
reason for his presence aboard the
minerva it suddenlv occurred to me
that he had listened intently to my story
of my return trip to california via the
hundred golden hours at sea of my
raisin industry in the san joaquin val-
ley and my abhorrence of anything
eastern but never a word had he said
as to why he was sailing on the whole
i decided it was unusual newspaper
men rarely travel just for mere fun-
they havent that much money as a
rule and the interstate commerce
commission had made free transporta-
tion a vision of the shadowy past

  did his paper imagine that something
would happen on this particular trip of
the minerva to justify sending one of
their men along the thought appealed
to me as not unlikely

  forbes and his young wife appear-
ing on deck and seating themselves in
the empty chairs adjacent to larkins
and mine broke up my reverie lar-
kins glanced at them casually then was
once more intent on the magazine in his
hand

  i however studied them as closely
as i could without being openly rude
this was not difficult as the two cen-
tered their eyes words and thoughts
on each other-not in the way of most
bridal couples strange to say for it
was very evident that some serious dis-
agreement had arisen between them

  forbes attitude was that of a man
trying to explain something so i
judged as i could not hear a word that
was spoken but i count myself a fair
reader of the human countenance i
could plainly see that h was not suc-
ceeding in his explanation his wife
sat erect in her chair and chin in hand
watched the dim shore line over which
the sun was hanging like a big ball of
molten copper the few times she did
look at her husband i was startled to
note that her glance was filled with
actual loathing once when he was
the phantom shotgun



pleading he laid his hand on her arm
and instantly her eyes were ablaze with
anger

  it was not difficult to figure out a
reason for all this forbes had de-
ceived her as to van buren court-
landts death i argued to myself and
courtlandts appearance on the deck of
the minerva was like a rising from the
grave

  glancing at larkins to see why in
the world he took no notice of what
was going on i saw his eyes still de-
vouring the printed pages of his gaud-
ily covered magazine then i made a
discovery larkins eyes were riveted
on the periodical but not a page had he
turned for at least a half hour

  i leaned over and addressed him
do you know who are behind you

  sure dont you he answered
equably and then we were both dis-
tracted by mrs forbes rising abruptly

   please elizabeth pleaded her hus-
bands voice

   she ignored him utterly and turning
to a uniformed officer who i afterward
learned was mr woodruff the first
officer she asked to be taken to the cap-
tain the two moved off together and
as i arose from my chair i heard them
going up the forward-deck companion-
way forbes preceded us inside and
as he unlocked the door of his suite i
found it was next to my own stateroom
which lay between his stateroom a
and the library of the vessel larkins
room was number two directly across
the-social hallway from mine

  larkins knocked at my door just
after the trumpeter was sounding the
half-hour warning for dinner

  do you know who has just entered
the forbes suite he asked as he sat
on the edge of my berth captain
loyd 

chapter iii

the curious cipher code

  dinner was uneventful forbes was
in his place but his wife did not make
her appearance in the dining saloon
later in the smoking room i found
every passengers tongue wagging to

judge by the male element and the
forbes naturally were the one and ab-
sorbing topic

  humph  said larkins to me as we
sat at one of the small tables with our
drinks before us they say women
are gossips and he nodded his head
toward the clusters of men eagerly dis-
cussing the forbes affair

  i tell you i know broke in a mans
voice loudly she has the stateroom
next to the pursers opposite the one
her husband occupies she had her
things moved in while every one was
at supper

  larkins and i looked up with inter-
est

  guess their honeymoon is on the
wane already observed another
does any one know the young chap
thats proving a sort of belated lochin-
var he seems to be the disturbing
element

  the gossip ran on then suddenly a
hush fell as courtlandt entered the
room from the deck by his expres-
sion i could see that he suspected who
were the topic of conversation i half
expected to see him give active vent to
the smoldering fury in his eyes when
larkins surprised me by catching the
young fellows coat as he passed our
table

  sit down with us a moment mr
courtlandt said my companion

  the young man looked at larkins
coldly my name is barthney he
said with quiet deliberation

  sit down said larkins in a low
voice theyre all looking at you
my names larkins-of the evening
ledger

  courtlandt sank into the empty seat
between the newspaper man and my-
self oh i say old man thank you-
thank you he held an unsteady hand
toward larkins you dont know how
ive always wanted to express my ap-
preciation for what you did for me that
time but-

  thats all right-er-barthney
tickled me to death got a big beat on
it said larkins say what are we
drinking and he pushed the bell for


the cpopullcr magazine

the bar steward then introduced me to
the young man

  courtlandt swallowed his drink of
straight whisky feverishly larkins
and i merely sipped a liqueur

  say boy chided the reporter id
cut out that raw stuff if i were you
what in the name of all thats good
are you doing on this boat 

  the young fellow glanced at me
quickly oh thats all right said
larkins mr marshall knows who
you are and i vouch for him

  good heavens mr larkins ex-
claimed courtlandt passionately do
you suppose that i would have set foot
on this infernal boat if i had imagined
that they were sailing on it why i

wouldnt-

  lower your voice warned larkins
sharply theyre all looking at you
a steward entered and handed
courtlandt a note

  the erivelope was of the ships sta-
tionery and contained a single sheet of
note paper courtlandt read it very
slowly then wrote a single word in
reply and passed it to the steward

  larkins sharp wits apparently
needed nothing further to make the
situation clear to him for as he
knocked the ashes from his cigarette
he said slowly and in the-frank pleas-
ant way which made it impossible for
one to take offense 

  courtlandt im not butting into this
thing merely because poking my nose
in other peoples affairs is my bread
and butter but i want to say just one
thing to you-and mr marshall here
who is an older and probably a wiser
man than either of us will bear me out
i think when a mans in the mess youre
in its his cue to tell the truth the
whole truth and nothing but the truth
dont lie or quibble hand her the
straight unvarnished-sabe

  courtlandt arose and looked straight
into larkins eyes thats good ad-
vice he said wearily then a slow smile
broke over his face i suppose it takes
a yellow journalist to appreciate the
value of the truth and he passed on
out

  as larkins and i were about to leave

a steward picked up something from
under the table we had occupied and
handed it to me it was a sheet of note
paper covered with peculiar hiero-
glyphics

  not mine i said passing it on to
larkins he glanced at it thought-
fully for a moment then folded it and
put it in his pocket

  i guess this belongs to courtlandt
he said its that note he got although
it looks more like a problem in chinese
mathematics than a billet-doux

  five bells struck as we descended
from the upper to the saloon deck at
my suggestion we made for our steamer
chairs to enjoy one more smoke before
retiring as we neared the forward
part of the deck i noted the figures of a
man and a woman occupying our chairs
and engrossed in earnest conversation

  the womans voice rose in sudden
passion a man who would so trick a
girl deserves the death-dealing hand of

god- then she broke off with a

slight cry of dismay as larkins and i
passed where they were seated

 mrs forbes and young court-
landt  i exclaimed when we had
rounded the forward part of the deck
and crossed to the port side

  yes assented the newspaper man
you know i feel sorry for her her
illusion was so quickly shattered

  you heard what was said in the
smoking room as to her taking another
stateroom didnt you  i asked

  oh i was wise before that gabby
individual sprang it was larkins re-
ply she went to captain loyd and
explained something to him five min-
utes later the purser was ordered to
assign her to another stateroom she
and her effects are now in suite c
funny- and he paused

  i fail to see anything so very funny
in her dilemma

  she asked the oaptain to turn the
ship back and land her in new york
he chuckled-

  poor girl i sighed

  as we circled the deck again i tapped
the stained-glass window of stateroom
a and called larkins attention to the
the phantom shotgun



fact that the light in forbes stateroom
was still burning brightly

  yes i see my companion chuckled
again he has one of the stewards
getting blisters on his feet chasing gin
fizzes into him

  the decks were deserted save for
courtlandt and mrs forbes who were
still talking earnestly and the reporter
and myself the deck lights had been
turned off at eleven and the ship was
in darkness save for a light here and
there shining out of the companion-
ways

  you must be tired said larkins
most solicitously offering the support
of his arm

  i stiffened instantly for any illusion
to my infirmity however veiled or kind-
ly meant irritated me i was willing to
limp through life without the sympathy
of others or any assistance save that
which my cane gave me

  larkins saw my displeasure and
quickly said i beg your pardon and
took up the thread of our conversation
in his characteristically disarming man-
ner from that time larkins fully re-
spected my supersensitiveness as to my
offending clubfoot and even on the
rare occasions when i inadvertently
dropped my cane-and rare they were
for i guarded myself vigilantly against
the embarrassment of being without
even its momentary support-he con-
siderately allowed me to recover it for
myself knowing i would prefer this in-
convenience to the humiliation of his
proffered aid

  as the reporter and i neared the for-
ward portion of the ship on our way
to our staterooms a cry of a man
frightful in its agony and fear rang
through the ship and hamilton forbes
stumbled from his stateroom in a
frenzy of terror

  his eyes bloodshot and wild had the
glint of a hunted animal and i saw
with disgust that he must be suffering
from some horrible hallucination of
overdrink

  dont let him get me he cried
help help warding off imaginary
figures with his hands hes going to
murder me

 larkins sprang toward him and
grasped him roughly by the arm

  here here said the reporter
brace up youve got a bad case of
the jimjams

  the purser and the chief steward
hurried from their staterooms at the
sound of the disturbance and likewise
came woodruff the first officer run-
ning along the deck from the bridge
the next moment courtlandt mrs
forbes and a few startled passengers
made up a group that quickly sur-
rounded the panic-stricken man

  hes going to murder me to-night
shrieked forbes to-night--to-night
who demanded woodruff impa-
tiently

  forbes held out a trembling hand
clutched between his fingers was a
crumpled piece of paper

  the first officer straightened out the
little slip and stared at it blankly for a
few seconds

  well of all the rot he ejaculated
what do you mean by losing your
head in this manner over a silly bunch
of figures 

  forbes teeth were chattering so furi-
ously that he could make no intelligible
reply but larkins broke in eagerly

  i beg your pardon mr woodruff
he said but may i have a look at that
bit of paper the officer passed it
over and larkins studied it intently
it is some sort of cipher he said and
as larkins afterward made a copy of
it i give it here

the cpopulacr magazine

  by this time captain loyd had joined
the throng around the excited man
see here mr forbes he demanded
harshly what does this mean

   it means that my life is threatened
gasped forbes death it says captain
-death oh save me-hes going to
kill me to-night the last word was
a shriek of absolute terror

  here here pull yourself together
mr forbes said the skipper what
has scared you  this foolish collection
of figures and he indicated the cipher
larkins handed him

  with a groan forbes clapped both
hands before his eyes dont let me
see it he pleaded pitifully it spells
-death

  but where did you get it man
  just an instant ago

  where-vhere i asked you

  it was lying on my bed it has come
at last for years fool-fool that i
was-   forbes broke into hysteri-
cal laughter to have thought all
these years that i was safe-that he was

dead--

   stop this  thundered captain loyd
for heavens sake be a man he
turned and addressed the group of pas-
sengers be good enough to leave me
alone with mr forbes mr larkins
and mr marshall ill ask you to re-
main he continued and accompany
mr woodruff and myself to mr
forbes room there may be some-
thing serious under all this

  forbes had staggered to the couch in
the parlor of the suite and flung him-
self upon it

   looks like plain d ts to me said
larkins

  come mr forbes show me where
you found this cipher thing captain
loyd urged in a more kindly tone see
ing the man was physically overcome
forbes staggered into the bedroom
and pointed tremblingly to the far side
of the bed

   there he said faintly

  who was in this room with you to-
night captain loyd asked

  no one

  captain larkins interrupted may
i ask mr forbes a few questions  this

is more along my line he explained
apologetically and i begin to see
something besides john barleycorn
here a

  certainly said the skipper with
manifest relief

  larkins turned to forbes you say
you were all alone mr forbes he
queried

  yes

  who was last inthis room besides
yourself 

- mrs forbes

  are you sure

  absolutely sure

  what time was that

  this afternoon

  was that when she was removing
her effects to the opposite stateroom
an angry red flamed in forbes
cheeks what right have you to ques-
tion me in such a manner  he de-
manded sullenly

  i dont mean to be offensive mr
forbes larkins said gently im only
trying to make use of my ability as a
newspaper sleuth smiling whimsically
to discover the why and wherefore of
this thing that troubles you so and you
would like us to get at the bottom of it
wouldnt you

  forbes shuddered go ahead and
quizz me all you wish he said wearily
what does it matter to a man who has
only a few more hours in this world-
a marked man sir a marked man
cheer up then the worst is yet to
come said larkins flippantly what
if you do read a tragic warning in this
simple bunch of numerals dont you
suppose youll be properly safeguarded
on this ship somebodys just throw-
ing a scare into you thats all what
idiot is going to deliberately jeopardize
his personal safety and liberty by as-
saulting you with murderous intent now
that were all wise brace up and give
me a few straight answers and well see
what we can do toward nailing the vil-
lain of the piece now tell me did you
see the cipher on the bed an hour ago 
no

  do you think you would have seen it
if it had been there

  yes i am sure i would
the phantom shotglfn

ii

  umph  said larkins absolutely
certain 

  absolutely

  you were also absolutely certain
mrs forbes was the last person in this
stateroom besides yourself before you
found the cipher

  well impatiently

  well returned larkins who
brought all these in  he indicated the
various empty glasses in both rooms

  oh only a steward-

  suppose we take a slant at him
said the reporter what steward was
it he put the question to the chief
steward whom the captain had sum-
moned to the stateroom

  ill see said the officer hurrying
out and returning shortly with one of
his subordinates the little steward who
served the first table at mealtimes like
a good many others in his particular
line of employment he was an english-
man

  whats your name asked larkins
taking the little fellow in from head to
foot

  the steward just awakened from a
sound sleep was bewildered and fright-
ened

  thompson sir he replied

  when were you in this room last
  a little after seven bells sir

  did you ever see this before lar-
kins held up the cipher message
no-o-o sir

  sure 

  sure sir

  you didnt bring it into the room
  no sir

  how much of a tip did you get for
bringing it in 

  nothink sir i didnt so elp me
sir mystified and dazed he turned
from one to the other like a little ter-
rified rabbit

  all right you can go snapped lar-
kins to the captain he said that
eliminates him

  of course assented captain loyd
eagerly

  mr forbes said the reporter
now that we know how this slip of
paper came in here suppose you tell us
what it means

  well how in thunder did it get in
here the captain asked voicing the
question for us all

  some one from the deck dropped it
through the upper portion of that win-
dow of course-the part that is regu-
lated by a screw from the inside by a
process of elimination as friend sher-
lock would say nothing was left to sus-
pect but that opening

  we all turned our eyes on the win-
dow indicated the bed was directly
beneath it just where a note or any
object for that matter would fall if
dropped through the opening

  that seems to be the answer con-
ceded the captain now we must find
out who was on deck during the past
hour he turned to woodruff the
first officer

  i think i know pretty well larkins
broke in there were mr marshall
myself mrs forbes and the young fel-
low listed as-barthney i believe
now i pledge my word that i didnt
drop that cipher in here nor did mr
marshall as i was with him all the
time mrs forbes and-barthney
were both within fifteen feet of the win-
dow seated in steamer chairs whenever
we saw them and i dont think there
was another soul on the deck

  i suggest that you tell us what is in
that cipher mr forbes said the cap-
tain

  we all concentrated our gaze on
forbes i-i cannot-i dare not he
almost sobbed enough that i have
told you that it threatens my life-and
to-night but-here he pulled him-
self together and spoke with quiet de-
liberation-neither mrs forbes nor
mr courtlandt who has chosen to as-
sume the name of barthney had any-
thing to do with this affair i-i know
that my trouble with my wife has no

bearing whatever- he stopped

abruptly his eyes staring fixedly at the
wall back of where the group of us
stood

  there-there it is again he
shrieked wildly god save me and
he plunged forward on his face in the
narrow confines of the room

  we all turned to the wall as one man


the cpocpulacr magazine

to see what he had pointed at and there
scrawled in lead pencil was a symbol or
letter 

chapter iv

the shot in the night

  the purser and steward raised the
unconscious form of forbes from the
floor where he had fallen prostrate and
laid him on the bed

  i dont know but what it is a case
of plain drunk after all mused the
captain aloud why the man reads
sinister meanings in the merest trifles-
a bit of paper-a scratch on the wall

  larkins looked thoughtful maybe
youre right besides this unfortunate
misunderstanding with his wife prey-
ing on his mind and combined with all
the booze hes been tucking under his
belt is enough to make him see almost
anything in any case hes best left
alone the chances are hell sleep it off
and wake up in his right mind and a
taste in his mouth like a shoemakers
apron

  the captain saw that forbes was
made as comfortable as possible then
we all passed out leaving the broker
apparently in a drunken stupor and
breathing heavily

  there goes three bells said the
purser time all sober men were abed
so we all dispersed laughing larkins
flinging me a good night over his
shoulder as we simultaneously entered
our respective staterooms

  eight bells-four oclock in the morn-
ing-were striking when i answered to
an excited hammering at my door

  marshall marshall come on outs
for the love of mike larkins voice
was shouting youre going to miss
the first edition if you dont hurry
whats happened  i asked stum-
bkng hurriedly from my bunk and put-
ting on my shoesbefore i unlocked the
door

  lord mart what a sleeper you must
be didnt you hear the shot 

  thats funny i did hearit i sup-
pose only i thought i was dreaming
it was no idle dream believe me it
was the real thing come on out-i
dont look any handsomer than you do
-get a wiggle on  larkins eyes were
snapping with excitement and his slen-
der nostrils quivered like a thorough-
bred horses

  i grasped my cane and followed in
his wake clad as he was in a bath robe
and little else meeting a number of our
fellow passengers in the broad social
hall similarly attired

  thereporter headed toward the door
of stateroom a where a group of the
ships officers in various stages of un-
dress had gathered the purser was
making bungling efforts to open the
door which was obviously locked on the
inside when larkins broke through the
crowd in his usual aggressive fashion
and threw his weight against the panels

  come on all you dopes and lend a
shoulder he cried weve got to
break in here dont you see he may
be dying-dead great scott he
added under his breath what a scoop
for the ledger

  when the combined efforts of lar-
kins woodruff and the burly chief en-
gineer failed to budge the door an inch
captain loyd sent the engineer rushing
aft for some sort of tools with which to
batter it in

  while we stood grouped about the
doorway everybody talking at once in
high-pitched excited voices young
courtlandt suddenly appeared on the
scene fully dressed and noticeably pale

  whats the row  he asked and
even to the most casual observer it wras
the phantom shotgun



plain that some stronger feeling than
the contagion of excitement had him in
its grip

  matter enough responded the skip-
per gruffly this man forbes has
either committed suicide or has been
shot you seem to have had more time
than the rest of us for a careful toilet
mr courtlandt he added tartly the
whole forbes affair was getting on his
nerves

  more than one of us had noticed and
wondered at courtlandts dress for that
hour of the morning the young man
flushed darkly at the captains remark

  i was already dressed when i heard
the shot he explained stiffly i
couldnt sleep-i was taking a turn on
deck

  he was plainly ill at ease but before
anything else could be said to add to his
discomfort we were all struck dumb by
elizabeth forbes sudden appearance on
the scene she too was fully dressed

  oh what is it-what is the matter
captain she cried i heard a shot
has-has-mr forbes done anything
desperate oh wont somebody an-
swer me  she turned appealingly
from one to the other

  the captain was the first to recover
his voice and laid a soothing hand on
the arm of the girl there there
child he said gently we dont know
just what has happened here but we are
going to find out right away until we
do wont you oblige me by returning to
your stateroom mrs treemore will
go with you and x will see you pres-
ently and tell you everything it is your
right to know

  she began to sob quietly as the stew-
ardess stepped forward and with moth-
erly tenderness drew her away as
they passed across the hall the crowd
making way in awed silence i could see
that larkins was scrutinizing mrs
forbes with undue interest and it came
upon me that he was speculating as i
had been why elizabeth was so fully
dressed at four in the morning

  mcdonald and two of his assistants
came hurrying back at this instant and
the work of battering in the door re-
quired but a few moments

  captain loyd turned on the threshold
as he and the purser were about to en-
ter and waved back the curious crowd
pressing close everybody remain
outside please mr larkins will you
come in with me-and you too mr
marshall i will want some witnesses
to this thing i suppose

  i will never forget nor ever describe
how the sight of forbes lying in a pool
of blood which poured from wounds
in both his head and chest sickened and
unnerved me he was lying just where
we had left him earlier in the evening
and as the captain bent over the pros-
trate form he exclaimed in horror
the man is dead

  larkins had been taking a rapid in-
ventory of everything

  and furthermore captain the
newspaper man spoke with quiet con-
viction the man has been murdered
murdered how do you know
the captains voice rose above the star-
tled cries of every one who heard lar-
kins charge

  he has been killed by a shotgun
replied the reporter it is plain that he
didnt hold the weapon himself as the
shots are too scattered and there are
no marks of powder burn but if fur-
ther proof is needed i call attention to
the fact that a cursory glance about the
room does not reveal a shotgun any-
where  will you let me search the
place thoroughly captain with the as-
sistance of mr everett

  i will be grateful indeed my dear
boy and i will appreciate it if you will
let me depend on your larger experience
to discover whatever you can about this
fearful affair why sir its got me on
edge and the captain mopped his brow
and stamped irritably toward the door
where he and i stood while larkins and
the purser searched stateroom a

  the parlor the little hallway leading
into the private bathroom and the bath-
room itself were explored without re-
sult  this was to be expected because
the door leading into the bathroom and
the parlor was found to be locked from
the inside of the room where forbes
met his death as was the door leading
out in the companionway


the cpocpulflcr magazine

  in the bedroom larkins crawled un-
der the bed peered into the wardrobe
and closely scrutinized the floor in every
direction

  im stumped  he muttered heres
a mystery that id like to flood with the
torrents of my penetration submerge in
the depths of my superior enlighten-
ment bathe in the overflow of my vast
powers of intuition and im stumped
-thats all

  as far as i can see the shot was
fired through the window said the
purser

  which shows that the window is as
far as you can see returned larkins
use your mind along with your eyes
and you will notice that the body is ly-
ing directly below the window and both
the wall and the window bear indenta-
tions of the bullets that weapon was
fired from the door by which we entered
this room

   impossible cried several of us in
unison

  impossible nothing snapped the
reporter the bullet holes in the wall
opposite and those which are in the
mattress prove it beyond a doubt he
strode over to the bed and heaved the
body aside with the utmost composure

  a cry of horror and amazement went
up from all of us where the body had
lain a nickel-plated thirty-two caliber
revolver reflected the brilliant electric
light that flooded the stateroom

  there cried the purser trium-
phantly you are away off mr
newspaper man detective he shot
himself with his own pistol

  really drawled larkins picking
up the revolver and twirling the cham-
ber with his thumb how clever he
must have been then after shooting
himself the room and the bed full of
holes to clean the gat and reload my
word mr purser man he was almost
as clever a corpse as you are a live
one

  larkins passed the revolver into
captain loyds keeping poor devil
he said hadnt any more chance than
a rabbit let me see he went on
i thoughtfully four bullet holes in his
head three in his body one two three

four in the wall counting the one
through the window and five through
the bed-sixteen in all he placed
the body back in its original position
and going to the washstand beside the
bed coolly washed his hands

  who knows anything about shot-
guns he queried raising his voice to
gain attention from those in the door-
way who were talking at the top of
their voices nobody answering him
he turned to the bullet holes in the
wall and with his knife dug out one
of the leaden pellets and examined it
thoughtfully i guess a sixteen-gauge
would hold about that number of shots
all right from the way they scattered
it wasnt a chokebore he surveyed
the room again long and carefully then
said

  humph i give it up

  well we know one thing for cer-
tain said the captain mr forbes
was murdered

  we know two things you mean
said i though i am by rule a diffident
man and rarely offer an opinion unless
i am pressed mr forbes has been
murdered and a shotgun was the
weapon used it strikes me that by
finding the shotgun we shall thus find
the murderer

  good boy exclaimed larkins giv-
ing me a resounding whack across the
shoulder and embarrassing me consid-
erably here we have him-the man
with the idea well me for the hay
as i turned to enter my room i
heard captain loyds voice giving an
order to the first officer

  mr woodruff assemble the watch
and search every part of this ship from
bow to stern and from deck to keelson
passengers rooms and effects but find
that shotgun

chapter v

the captains inquiry

  youve nearly missed your break
fast i  remarked as larkins saun-
tered into the dining saloon shortly be-
fore nine you should have risen
earlier

  earlier he laughed go up and
the phantom shotgun



tell that to sparks  using the wire-
less operators nickname

  sure enough the tearing rasping
cra-s-s-sh cra-s-s-sh of the wireless
was grinding away incessantly and i
realized that larkins had indeed been
up betimes and the story of last nights
tragedy was flying over space to the
hungry presses of his paper

  i suppose theyll be swamping new
york with luridly headlined editions all
day lucky for your paper you were
aboard wasnt it

  luckys my middle name said the
reporter sampling his grapefruit with
evident relish

  when he had finished breakfast we
left the dining saloon together and as
we proceeded to the upper deck the
crash of the wireless instrument tore
into the stillness of the rest of the ship

  wthat will man achieve next i
asked- just to think that the little
sounds that are flying from those
wires and i pointed to the four thin
threads of copper strung from the for-
ward mast back to the big black
smokestack can be heard in new
york

  you think again larkins-advised
come here and he led me around to
the starboard side of the vessel see
that boat

  out on the swelling bosom of the at-
lantic dipping and curtsying as the
minerva approached was a vessel with
peculiar masts

   thats a lightship i said

  right-diamond shoals at pres-
ent our wireless operator is still in com-
munication with norfolk virginia he
picked it up early this morning but
we are steadily going south and getting
out of the radius of our sending power
therefore in a little while sparks will
send to the lightship and the govern-
ment operator aboard will relay our
messages on to the navy-yard station
the aerials are not high enough to send
over two hundred miles

  he drew me around to where the
operators room could be seen from the
deck sparks is getting something
now larkins said as there was a ces-
sation of crashes from the little room

  crash cr-a-s-s-ssssh cras-sh
cras-sh sputtered the instrument
again suddenly lighting the room with
a ghastly greenish-blue glare and then
silence followed once more

  what is being said  i asked

  you cant hear that from here ex-
plained larkins you catch the
sounds from receivers the same as you
do over a telephone-maybe hil re-
peat and then ill know what the mes-
sage was

  crash cras-s-sh cras-s-h-h-h-h
the instrument thundered springing
into life with a suddenness that made
me jump for some time the din kept
up making as larkins put it as much
noise as a cook stove falling down-
stairs then subsided into complete si-
lence save for the whine of the motor
as it came to a gradual stop

  humph ejaculated the reporter
we go on to new orleans without
stop he repeated the message to nor-
folk luckily i can read morse

  do they use the morse code on the
wireless i asked

  he nodded affirmatively the fed-
eral courts will have to handle the
forbes case you see we were beyond
the three-mile limit-in fact fifty miles
offshore- when the crime was com-
mitted captain loyd wired to his
company for orders and they directed
him to make no change in the schedule
of the boat the authorities in new
orleans are to take charge of the case
when we reach there

  but what is captain loyd going to
do in the meantime i asked here
is a murder committed on his boat and
he has only gone into the matter super-
ficially surely he-

  oh the captains on the job all
right larkins interrupted a full
and thorough investigation has been
set under way and well all be called
into the dining saloon to act as sort of
coroners jurors i believe

  the newspaper man was right and
at half past ten we were all summoned
belowr-and what a morbid lot we
were all of the eighty-odd passen-
gers aboard took their places at differ-
ent tables near the one where the cap-


the populatl magazine

 tain sat with his first officer larkins
 and a passenger who having confessed
 to a smattering knowledge of short-
 hand was to act as stenographer

   captain loyd in announcing the in-
 quiry about to be held explained that
 while it was not exactly according to
 the law it was well within his rights
 as commander of the vessel upon which
 the crime had been committed and that
 he was taking this course as a means
 of possibly fastening the guilt where it
 belonged some one on board was
 guilty of the murder of hamilton
 forbes he continued and it was his
 duty to find such person arid place him
 or her in close custody until land and
 the law were reached

   i think it would be a good plan to
 appoint a committee of gentlemen to
 act as a kind of jury the captain con-
 chided i am
 going to ask
 mr marshall to
 act as foreman
 of jury or com-
 mittee

  i therefore
moved up to the
captains table
presently being
joined by the
others whom
the captain
named to serve

   it didnt sur-
 prise me when
 the captain
 turned over to
 larkins the
 business of con-
 ducting the in-
 quiry and it
 goes without saying that that young
 man was in his glory and was possibly
 the only person in the big room who
 was thoroughly enjoying himself

   the purser mr everett was the
 first to be examined he told briefly
 of hearing the loud report of the gun
 that awakened him how he lay won-
 dering for a short interval then after
 practically dressing how he stepped
 out into the companionway to see in
 the dim light smoke curling under the

low ceiling near the door of stateroom
a his first impression was that some
one had fired a gunpowder weapon in
the social hall then he remembered the
scene he had witnessed in the stateroom
itself just before midnight and it
flashed upon him that forbes had com-
mitted suicide

 he rushed over and began pounding
on the door receiving no answer by
that time the hall had filled wfith others
who had heard the shot when he had
finished his plain statement of fact
larkins began to question him

  so that the reader may be aided in
following the incidents or series of ac-
cidents and deaths that occurred on
that momentous trip of the s s mi-
nerva i append a plan of the forward
part of the steamer

  do you think that you could have

seen any one in the hall from your room
if he or she had used a shotgun at the
door of mr forbes stateroom asked
the newspaper man or had sufficient
time elapsed for the guilty person to
escape by the time you entered the
hall 

  mr everett thought that it would
have been possible for such a person
to escape to other parts of the ship by
the time he everett looked out of his
room

the phantom shotgun



  the captain next called the chief
steward whose testimony was almost
identical with that of the purser save
that he opened the door of his state-
room almost immediately on hearing
the shot and peered out he too saw
no one and swore to the fact that no
one could have gone down the star-
board companionway without being
seen by him

  mr truesdale called the captain
mr truesdale proved to be an elder-
ly gentleman returning to his home in
mississippi whose stateroom was on
the port side he testified that the roar
of the weapon awakened him and be-
ing of an exceedingly nervous tempera-
ment he at once sprang from his bunk
and into the companionway and while
he could not see the door of stateroom
a or the social hall he would make
affidavit to the fact that no one fled
down the port companionway

  this leaves us the alternative of be-
lieving that the murderer went up the
stairs to the deck above out on deck
from the cross companionway either
the port or starboard or ran below to
this the dining saloon summed up
larkins and now captain perhaps
the stewardess mrs treemore whose
room is at the top of the stairs can
offer some testimony

  the stewardess left mrs forbes
side and sat at the foot of the captains
table she told how the shot had awak-
ened her how she had stood in the
doorway of her stateroom then walked
to the head of the stairway in time to
see the purser violently shake the han-
dle of mr forbes door she was
quite positive that she could have seen
any one coming up the stairs had the
murderer chosen that avenue of escape
she told of joining the group at the
door of stateroom a and of afterward
accompanying mrs forbes to her state-
room which was c opposite the one
where the men were gathered trying to
effect an entrance

  hyv was mrs forbes dressed
asked larkins

  she had on the same clothes she had
worn all evening-i had given her some
b

headache powders earlier in the night
mrs treemore replied

  did she say anything to you when
you accompanied her to her stateroom
-i refer to the time when efforts were
being made to break into mr forbes
room 

  the stewardess hesitated glancing
appealingly at mrs forbes then an-
swered in a low tone yes sir
what did she say

  i remarked that i hoped nothing
dreadful had happened to mr forbes
and she said poor dear in a dreadfully
tired voice well it would be the judg-
ment of a just god and added that
she had had a premonition that some-
thing would happen and that she hadnt
been able to sleep so i persuaded her
to let me help her off with her clothes
and tucked her in bed

  did you see a weapon of any kind
in mrs forbes room

  i certainly did not mrs treemore
answered indignantly mrs forbes
never killed her husband and you know
it

  i simply want to establish that fact
beyond a doubt replied the reporter
gently and perhaps you can help me
did you make a thorough search of
mrs forbes suite afterward 

  yes sir mr woodruff the first
officer ordered it a short time later but
i found nothing

  thank you mrs treemore oh
one question more please did you and
the assistant stewardess search the
staterooms of all the women passengers
on board pursuant to mr woodruffs
orders 

  yes sir but found nothing in the
nature of a weapon-that is nothing
but hatpins she added dryly

  the stewardess resumed her seat be-
sides mrs forbes

  woodruff was the next witness he
told of hearing the sound of the shot
from the bridge where he was on duty
and of how after first awakening the
captain he had made his way below
and found an excited throng at the door
of mr forbes stateroom under or-
ders from the captain he had taken a
number of the stewards and made a


the popular magazine

thorough search of the ship passengers
rooms and crews quarters all of
which had been minutely examined for
a weapon but without success

  how do you think this murder was
committed queried the reporter

  well ive figured it out said the
first officer that the person who fired
the shot was aware of the position of
the bed and taking a shotgun stood in
front of mr forbes stateroom door
put the muzzle through the narrow
space where the partition just escapes
reaching the ceiling and fired in the di-
rection of the bed i think the pres-
ence of smoke in the companionway
proves this

  there is such a space then asked
larkins

  yes asserted the first officer
after you pointed out this fact to me
early this morning i took the iron bar
that we used in breaking open the door
and demonstrated to you and the cap-
tain how such a thing was possible
why is there such a space mr
woodruff and have all the cabins on
the ship such openings

  yes they allow ventilation for the
rooms and are only on the inside of the
ship

  then this accounts for the fact that
the doors could be locked on the inside
and still mr forbes could be shot with-
out a person being in the room

  i believe so

  did you figure that it would be quite
a difficult thing to depress the muzzle
of a shotgun sufficiently to have it hit
a mark so close to the floor as mr
forbes bed

  only after you suggested it not
having a shotgun  board i could not
make a practical demonstration of it i
have ordered a rifle out of the ships
arsenal and i have it ready to try now
at the captains suggestion the com-
mittee together with the commander
larkins and the first officer went to
stateroom a the majority of us stood
outside while mr woodruff taking his
remington stood in the companionway
and from that spot put the muzzle of
the rifle in the narrow slit on the top of
the partition and endeavored to point

it at the bed now cleared of its ghastly
burden

  the experiment failed to dispel the
mystery for it was apparent to all that
the ventilation slit was too narrow and
too near the ceiling to allow the gun to
be pointed sufficiently downward the
stock striking the top of the companion-
way ceiling with the mystery only
deepened we returned to the dining
saloon where larkins announced the
failure to the remaining passengers

  questioning the first officer again
larkins made it plain from the shot
dug from the wall and the mattress that
the death-dealing missiles came down-
ward and from the direction of the
door which according to all testimony
was securely locked from the inside

  now mr woodruff since the shot-
gun theory has failed-unless when we
find the weapon we discover it to be like
the irishmans gun that could be fired
round a corner-have you any other to
advance 

  i am still of the opinion mr lar-
kins said the officer that a shotgun
was the weapon used the scattered
shots in the room together with the
fact that only one report and that an
extremely loud one was heard prove
this beyond a doubt there is not a re-
volver made that could do such execu-
tion or carry large shot in such num-
bers after firing the shot into the
room in some mysterious manner the
murderer fled upon deck threw the
weapon overboard and escaped into his
stateroom secure in the fact that he left
no clew

  could he have fied into the library
and then out on deck

  no the library is locked for the
night at six bells anyway it was thor-
oughly searched immediately after the
discovery of the murder

  then seeing that we have witnesses
that the murderer did not flee down
either companionway toward the aft
part of the ship or up the stairs as the
stewardess testimony shows you think
that this person went out one or other
of the doors that lead to the deck
that seems to be the only inference
had he run below we would have found
the phntm shotgun



him in our search for both doors lead-
ing into the pantries were locked se-
curely

  when the first officer was excused i
was interested in studying the faces of
the passengers who were gathered in
the saloon bewilderment was set on
every face and as the testimony was
heard each witness making the mystery
the more mysterious an obvious un-
easiness began to spread i could see
that the most of those gathered there
felt that there was something super-
natural about the whole affair

  mcdonald the chief engineer-a
broad-shouldered scotchman-was the
next to tell of his part in the nights
happenings he had come on deck
from below to get a breath of air be-
fore the change of watch at eight bells
he distinctly heard the noise of the
shot and hurried forward along the
starboard deck when he reached the
room he found the purser the chief
steward and mr larkins there

  did you see any one on deck as you
came along asked larkins

   yes sir

  here was a new phase of the case
there was quite a stir in the room as
everybody tried to get a better view of
the engineer

n did you recognize who it was
asked the reporter

  the engineer turned in the revolving
chair he occupied and pointed out van
buren courtlandt it was that gentle-
man over there he said

   here was a sensation indeed al-
most every one rose uttering exclama-
tions of dismay

  order order please commanded
captain loyd pounding his fist on the
table	

  larkins never blinked an eyelash or
displayed the least astonishment and i
wondered how much of a surprise this
was to him

  mr courtlandt will you please
come forward  he said

  courtlandt his face singularly pale
rose and walked to the captains table
and took a seat beside the reporter

  now mr mcdonald please tell us
what mr courtlandt was doing lar-

kins asked tell us just where you
saw him and what his actions were
mcdonald cleared his throat noisily
one could see that the burly scot did
not relish the thought of what he was
about to say

  i was cornin up the starboard deck
at a pretty lively speed he said this
was after hearin the shot ye mind
some one was leanin over the rail just
opposite the companionway amidships
an i stops an says what was yon
shootin the lad here saysi dinna
ken there was a sickly licht on the
deck here cornin from one licht in the
companionway an besides the dawn
cornin made it muckle clearer on deck
than insides the ship the lad here
was shakin and breathin hard so i
says lad you must a seen a ghost
but he didna say annythin to that an i
goes forard where we finds the poor
mon dead

  larkins turned to courtlandt and
said slowly this is something you
should explain van

  yes sir cried captain loyd
come come explain why you were
on deck at four in the morning fully

dressed and-

  one moment captain broke in
larkins and turning to the young fel-
low he said remember that any
statement you make may be used
against you and that your refusal to
answer any or all questions can in no
wray be accepted as a confession of
guilt

  i have nothing to conceal mr lar-
kins said courtlandt very quietly i
killed hamilton forbes

  there was a stunned silence in the
dining saloon as courtlandt made the
dumfounding admission of his guilt
for perhaps a moment not a soul stirred
a muscle then the sudden rustle of a
womans skirt broke the tense silence
as the murdered mans wife sprang to
her feet and almost ran toward the cap-
tain in her excitement and agitation

  mr courtlandt lied to you captain
loyd he said that to shield me it
was i who so deliberately shot mr
forbes

chapter vi

the love of a man for a woman

  in an instant all was wildest confu-
sion women fainted and men swore
courtlandt violent in his excitement
raved and stormed at the captain not
to believe anything mrs forbes said
he repeated again and again that he
was the guilty one and that mrs
forbes in beautiful but mistaken gen-
erosity was endeavoring to shield him

  larkins was almost excited i say
almost for as long as i was associated
with him on that steamer i never knew
him to come nearer losing that remark-
able grip on his self-possession twice
-three times he flung van buren
courtlandt into the chair beside him
and curtly bade mrs forbes to return
to her seat

  captain loyd while not bewildered
was plainly angry and his deep bass
boomed out in repeated calls for order
gradually quiet of a sort was restored
and he took charge of matters

   it is quite evident that one of you is
not telling the truth the captain said
i am going to get to the bottom of
this affair right now mrs treemore
please go with mrs forbes to her state-
room and stay there with her until i
send for you

  the stewardess accompanied mrs
forbes from the room and up the stairs
the protecting arm she offered the
murdered mans bride was declined
prettily and with a perfectly self-pos-
sessed smile never have i seen like
composure under such trying circum-
stances i loved her from that mo-
ment and let me add here that eliza-
beth kennedy forbes was the first and
only woman i ever loved in all my life

  you say that you killed hamilton
forbes said the captain addressing
young courtlandt and mrs forbes
contradicts you maintaining that she is
responsible for her husbands death
which if either is guilty

  i am replied courtlandt steadily

  explain

  well said courtlandt i am going
 to tell the story in my own way some
 years ago i entered the brokerage of-

 fices of hamilton forbes wall street
 concern at the time my family was
 not possessed with the fortune of the
 former courtlandts and i early struck
 out for myself i was approached per-
 sonally by mr forbes who was just
 then beginning to be a power in the
 street he frankly admitted that he of-
 fered me a place with his concern be-
 cause of my family connection declar-
 ing it would give prestige to the firm
 to have a member of so desirable a
 family appearing in its interests i ac-
 cepted with the determination to make
 good on my own account and to be-
 come of value to the concern for other
 than the snobbish reasons so candidly
 stated by mr forbes

  about the same time i entered the
forbes employ miss kennedy now
mrs forbes was employed as stenog-
rapher in a short time she became mr
forbes confidential stenographer and
within a year she was the ruling spirit
in the offices mr forbes relied upon
her business acumen to a large extent
and as i was next to him in the office
force miss kennedy and i saw a good
deal of each other

   the result was that we fell in love
and became engaged we were a very
happy pair indeed who told our pre-
cious secret to mr forbes that it
staggered him we both saw plainly at
the time we thought it was over the sim-
ple prospect of losing miss kenned
whom forbes declared invaluable to
him in a business way i however with
all a lovers jealousy was quick to con-
clude that forbes as well as i had
lost his heart to miss kennedy who
could help it added courtlandt his
face transfigured and a voice in my
own heart echoed who indeed 

  one morning when i arrived at the
offices he continued i was met by
two men who took me into a private
room and informed me that they wtere
central-office men and had a warrant
for my arrest on the charge of forgery
of certain bank shares

   i protested my innocence and so did
forbes in fact through the subsequent
trials i had to undergo he supplied the
money for my firm of lawyers and ap-
thb phantom shotgun



parently was the stanchest friend i
had his testimony while on the stand
appeared to be drawn from him reluc-
tantly but it was most damaging to my
case he swore that the forged shares
were never signed by him although i
raised money on them with the under-
standing that they were indorsed by his
signature a supposed confederate of
mine was produced who told of my in-
tended division of the spoils with him-
self and another this third man meet-
ing death in a street-car accident the
next day

  i had only one friend to stand by
me through it all and that was my af-
fianced wife she worked night and
day for me her testimony refuted in
part that of the man who alleged he
turned states evidence but the jury
found me guilty and i was sentenced
to a long term in prison forbes still
posed as my friend for he carried my
case to the appellate division only to
lose on evry appeal

  it seemed that nothing but a long
imprisonment awaited me when i was
given a new trial-brought about by a
newspaper reporter wtho strangely
enough was mr larkins here he dis-
covered that one of the jurors who con-
victed me had previously been the in-
mate of an insane asylum in one of the
middle western states and on this
ground i was given another trial

  on my second trial the alleged con-
federate of mine mixed his testimony
badly and earned me a hung jury and
on my third trial only three jurymen
stood for conviction soon after i wras
released as the district attorneys office
refused to prosecute further this was
because an election had robbed me of
one of my bitterest foes and one of
forbes closest friends-the district at-
torney himself i was free but smirched
with the humiliating stigma of a divided
jury

  warned that forbes had tried to
bring about my ruin i charged him to
his face with double-dealing miss ken-
nedy refused to believe that i was just
in my charges and i left new york for
the west in an endeavor to find the man
who could prove forbes the scoundrel

i knew him to be but my efforts to
locate this man were unsuccessful my
letters to miss kennedy went unan-
swered and i believed that she too had
turned against me

  here was where i made a fool of
myself i should have gone to her and
sought an understanding but a false
pride held me back once while i was
in arizona i read an account of my
death in an old new york paper and
being down on my luck doing chores
around a cattle ranch house i let it go
at that i argued that when i could go
to new york writh the proof of my in-
nocence it would be time enough for
my brother and two sisters to know that
i still lived

  then came the announcement of the
engagement of miss kennedy to
forbes enraged i started for new
york afoot-that shows how crazy i
was-but finally my better judgment
took hold of me and for months after
working in the power house of a big
copper mine in bisbee i scrimped and
saved until i had enough to take me to
the metropolis

  once there my courage failed the
papers were so full of the coming mar-
riage of the wall street millionaire and
his bride that i argued to myself who
was i to stop so brilliant a match  the
newspapers made a very pretty romance
of it all and i realized hopelessly that
i was out of it i decided-to go back
to arizona and booked return passage
on the minerva without the slightest
idea that the forbeses would select the
same steamer for their honeymoon trip

  when i saw the bridal party on the
wharf ready to come aboard i was thun-
derstruck my first impulse was tp
rush to the purser and demand to be
set ashore but in the end i did nothing
so dramatic i remained aboard and
everybody on the ship knows of my
meeting with mrs forbes

  mrs forbes sent me  note it was
written in a cipher we had used be-
fore and said simply that there was
something she would like to say to me
if i would go to her in the library it
doesnt matter what took place in that
interview she only meant to tell me


 the pocpulacr magazine

out of the goodness and sweetness of
her heart she had believed the report
that i had died in a saloon brawl in the
southwest

  but a nature as frank and open as
hers is not clever at concealment and
in every unguarded word she uttered i
was gleaning revelations of this man
forbes that incensed me beyond endur-
ance

  that night taking my shotgun and
with a small pair of nippers i turned
the key in his lock and too blinded
with rage even to notice that he was
overcome with drink i shot him like
the dog he was then i locked the
door threw the shotgun and nippers
into the sea and tried to appear as calm
and unconcerned as possible when the
chief engineer passed me and-thats
all there is to it then young court-
landt sat down heavily

  say van drawled larkins break-
ing the electric-charged silence com-
pared to you ananias was a piker

chapter vii

and a womans love for a man

  when i next saw larkins he and the
captain were having an argument about
courtlandt

  but he cant get off the ship and
walk larkins was saying its so
absurd to lock him up

  i can hardly permit a self-confessed
murderer to walk my decks unre-
strained objected the captain a bit
pompously

  captain captain murmured the re-
porter sadly do you mean to tell me
that you credit that beautiful lie upon
my word i believe i could sell you a
gold brick with infinite ease

 captain loyd only bridled and
cleared his throat noisily and larkins
moving off fv- u over his shoulder

  well im going to wire my city
editor that courtlandts confession is
no more to be credited than mrs
forbes

  you will do no such thing con-
tradicted the captain firmly i will

give orders to the wireless operator to
refuse any message from you

  dont do it said larkins you
know youre too good a sport for that
but all this trouble has got on your mind
and maxje it seasick the press has
some rights you know

  but the captain turned away with-
out replying and larkins chuckled

  you dont seem to care what captain
loyd threatens  said i

  oh not for-to-day ive filed all my
stuff already im laughing because
sparkshas had a wire from every pa-
per in manhattan for details of the
murder not to mention the frantic de-
mands of the associated press in the
meantime the ledger is having a wild
time with the hot stuff their special
correspondent on the spot has shipped
them ill bet that randolph our city
editor has laughed for the first time in
his crotchety existence

  what do you think of- i com-
menced

  now see here marshall ive come
to look upon you as a friend of mine
and id do anything for you but im
sick of the forbes mystery so please
give me a rest bet your bottom dol-
lar that neither courtlandt nor mrs
forbes is guilty larkins lit one of
his vile cigarettes and paced the deck
thoughtfully once he turned to me
and i looked at him expectantly for i
was sure that he was going to mention
something about the mystery

  say marshall he queried plain-
tively do you know whether we have
ice cream for luncheon or do we only
have it for dinner

  i refused to answer not thinking it
consistent for a man to mix murder
mysteries with ice cream

  oh mr larkins called the wire-
less operator as our pacing around the
upper deck brought us past the com-
panionway that led to his small office
heres an aerogram for you say he
continued in a much lower tone
whats up the skipper a little while
ago left orders that there was nothing
doing on any more messages from you
and that i couldnt answer the queries
from the other papers
the phantom shotgun



  are there many-other papers 
asked larkins

  the orb wants a hundred words

said sparks and the-

  good old reliable orb laughed the
reporter they want only the skele-
ton of the story and then theyll pad
it out i tell you what theres nothing
like those good old reliable papers
what does that yellow-hued affair the
sphere want

  oh all that i can give them re-
plied sparks gee im almost dead
now ive been hammering that old
key until i feel as if i could drop
youd better steal a little sleep while
the cap is peeved said larkins just
as soon as i tell him something hell
open the wires to me again

  sure of it laughed sparks

  larkins shook the message he had
just received at the wireless man and
added if you have brought me the
answer i expect

  say said sparks his eyes wide
open that message was going some
he stopped and thought hard for a
moment blessed if i can place the
description though

  you think real hard sparks re-
turned my friend the reporter and then
he fell in step with me again

  i waited hopefully for him to tell me
what his aerogram contained but when
he made no move to do so i couldnt
keep quiet any longer and i blurted
out

  you havent opened your message
no i havent have i said my
companion and i didnt ask any more
questions you can wager

  luncheon at one oclock was a very
dismal affair the crime of the night
before and the disclosures of the morn-
ing had affected the spirits of the pas-
sengers to a marked degree and gloomy
silence reigned in the dining saloon

  captain loyd was one of the first
down and i could plainly see that lar-
kins had news for him but like the able
general he was he waited until the skip-
per had almost finished his meal and
was attacking his dessert with relish
before he spoke

  captain i want to apologize if i

was too-well fresh this morning-the
lack of sleep set me on edge began
larkins

  oh thats all right mr larkins
returned captain loyd i guess we
are all a little upset however i think
it best that nothing more be sent to the
papers

  captain i want to make a little deal
with you suppose that you had on
board this ship an escaped convict-a
man wtho was serving a term for mur-
der at the time he made his get-away
well asked the captain

  well supposing he had been sent to
jail on the evidence of the man who
was murdered this morning

  mr larkins do you mean that there
is such a man on board this ship
yes i do mean just that

  i can scarcely credit such a thing
said captain loyd

  it is so nevertheless retorted lar-
kins if i should point out this person
to you and have the documents to prove
his identity will you let me use the
wireless 

  no sir i will not barter with you
returned the captain brusquely though
there was a twinkle in his eye but
as a slight token of my appreciation for
such shrewdness however i might give
the liberty of the ship and he laughed

  larkins passed over the sealed mes-
sage he had received saying that he had
not opened it for he was sure of its con-
tents the captain tore open the en-
velope and read the message with a
puzzled expression

  im afraid i do not understand he
said

  that is an answer i received from
the police headquarters of new york
city-the rogues gallery to be precise
it contains the bertillon measurements
and police history of the man to whom
i refer

  still i dont place whom you mean
larkins leaned over and whispered
something in the captains ear the
effect was magical

  thunder and lightning ejaculated
the skipper when you have finished
luncheon will you and mr marshall
come up to my quarters  well have it


the popular magazine

out there and the captain hurried
above

  during the rest of the meal larkins
was as conversational as a clam and
later led the way to the upper deck
just off the bridge we entered the cap-
tains quarters

  i have sent woodruff to bring the
fellow aloft he informed us as we en-
tered and then to my astonishment he
opened a small case and slipped an au-
tomatic pistol in his hip pocket just
as well i suppose he said to larkins
who nodded

  soon we heard the first officer and
some one coming up the ladder and i
was deeply surprised to note that it
was hallaron the deck steward who
followed mr woodruff into the room

  then i knew the answer to the little
scene larkins had enacted the day be-
fore with this steward the reporter
was looking for marks of identification
and evidently had found them

  hallaron stood before us ill at ease
and mystified i mentally decided that
larkins had made a mistake the stew-
ard had a look of genuine innocence on
his face

  you sent for me sir he said

  yes hallaron i did-

  captain why dont you call him
patton larkins interrupted quietly

  the steward went white as a sheet
and swung about to face the reporter
with a savage exclamation

  so said he thats why you
wanted me to show you how big my
arms was

  yes said larkins

  well the man looked from one to
the other of us sullenly

  hallaron said the captain you
have been with me on this ship almost
two years i have found you honest
faithful and sober in your habits at all
times so when mr larkins told me you
were an escaped convict found guilty
of a serious crime i could scarcely be-
lieve it

  well said the man its true
enough i guess the jigs up

  patton what do you know about the
murder of mr forbes larkin asked

  nothin at all sir except what
everybody else knows

  where wrere- you this morning when
he was killed 

  sleepin sir said the man without
hesitation

  did you drop a cipher note through
his window just before midnight
no sir

  did you recognize mr forbes when
he came aboard yesterday

  do you think i could ever forget
that -- he spat out the vile desig-
nation his face black with passion

  the mans dead hallaron said the
captain severely

  aye and thanks to god that he is
say i tears were gathered in the
mans eyes and his voice trembled as he
spoke he swore me into a livin death
with his black heart an lies starved
my wife to death an ruined my daugh-
ters life all the day ive sung a song
of joy an ill gladly go back to that
cell now as theres nothin left on earth
for me to avenge 

  how did such a man as hamilton
forbes ever come into your life i
asked amazed indeed at the mans out-
burst

  it were this way sir i were nothin
but a truck driver an i did my hard
days work along with the rest my
wife she had her troubles only when
id get a little too much of the drink
aboard but not after my little katie
grew up an a fine girl she were sirs
sure hugh i says to meself theres
a girl worth bein proud of an youd
better cut out the drink

  i did an the wife an me we gives
the girl the best there is one day i
were truckin down madison avenue
an a auto scrapes my wheels hey
you irish mutt yells one of the gents
in a big fur coat cant you see where
you goin  i were quick with me
tongue an i shoots off a lot of abuse
which truck drivers knows how to han-
dle proper the one what was drivin
the auto jumps out an shakes a big
wrench at me ive a good mind to
drive your nose in with this says he
sure says i supposin you try an i
climbs down an as the swell closes in
the phantom shotgun



on me i cops him on the jaw only after
he swipes me over th shoulder with the
big iron wrench i saw all red before
me at this piece of dirty work an when
heaims another swipe at me i knocks
him flat

  well he never got up again-alone
the man what stays in the car an never
does nothin but toot the horn for the
police was this forbes an when i
were brought to trial what does he do
he tells the jury that i took the wrench
from their machine an beats the man
with it over the head smashin his skull
the dirty liar his head gets fractured
when i knocks him to the car rail they
dont hang me seein i had a good repu-
tation-i only goes to prison for life

  an what becomes of my family an
the little flat i had in harlem  dispos-
sessed were they one day an my wife

dies from exposure while katie-

six months after i makes me get-away
i sneaks into noo york i hears about
my wife but nothin of katie one
night i were slinkin along forty-second
street goin east from broadway when
one of them girls grabs my arm where
you goin kid  she says somethin in
the voice makes me look at her close
then-i cant talk about it thank
god katie isnt leading that life now
but i tell you if forbes had a bin in
noo york that night hed a died then

  thats all there is to my story cap-
tain an im willin to go to the brig
whenever you say he concluded rub-
bing his tear-strewn face with the back
of his trembling hands

  we all looked at the steward in si-
lence

  plallaron said the captain finally
i wmt you to give me your promise
that you wont try to get away when we
reach new orleans give me your
word and you may continue at your
duties until we reach port

  yes sir said the man gratefully 
thank you sir

  pouf laughed larkins when the
man had gone there goes one of my
pet theories knocked into a cocked hat

  did you think he was the mur-
derer asked woodruff

  well you can never tell what i do

think when i get started said larkins
im liable to think any old thing

  at this point a steward informed the
captain that mrs forbes wished to see
him

  tell her youll see her wont you
captain larkins urged ill make
you a wager that shell come up here
with a wild yarn about how she shot her
husband with a shoehorn and insist
that courtlandt only pleaded guilty to
the deed because he thought she did it
the captain chuckled show her
up he ordered the steward

  that the strain was telling on eliza-
beth i could plainly see even in the sub-
dued light of the captains room her
face in spite of the suffering so appar-
ent there was as beautiful as ever and
my heart cried out to her-she seemed
so like a crushed and broken flower

  captain she said in her deep con-
tralto i come to you to protest against
the further incarceration of mr court-
landt he only confessed to the mur-
der of mr forbes because he knew i
was guilty dont you see hes sacrific-
ing himself for me

  oh rot burst from bobby lar-
kins earning a flashing rebuke from the
eyes i had grown to love in a short
twenty-four hours now look here
mrs forbes you know as well as i
do that you never even so much as shot
off a cap pistol much less a shotgun i
if mr forbes had met death from a
hatpin stab why we would probably be
willing to suspect you both you and
courtlandt are as guiltless as th inhab-
itants of mars or im going daft

  as captain loyd looked at the girl a
fatherly expression found place in his
rosy smooth-shaven face he reached
out and patted her hand

  i believe that mr larkins is right
my dear said the captain gently and
that you two young folks are both very
cheerful prevaricators mr woodruff
take this brave little girl below and give
mr courtlandt the freedom of the ship
i fancy he wont run away and he
brushed aside the girls faltering words
of gratitude

  come on said bobby i want to
see how sparks is making out as a cor-


the popular magazine

respondent and we made our way
down the ladder behind the first officer
and elizabeth she turned on seeing
larkins

  please may i thank you mrlar-
kins  she asked

  yes said bobby you may-that
is if you will let me first beg your par-
don for any harsh thing i might have
said to you

  the two then shook hands

  say said larkins to me after they
were out of earshot it must be great
to have a woman love you the way she
loves courtlandt

   chapter vii

   the weapon of death again

  an hour afterward we met court-
landt and mrs forbes pacing the decks
side by side needless to say they
were the cynosure of all eyes and her
flushed face gave mute evidence to the
fact that she was conscious of the vul-
gar stares leveled at them but she bore
herself with proud indifference

  in response to their invitation lar-
kins and i fell in step with them and
eventually the reporter and courtlandt
paired off leaving mrs forbes and my-
self to follow in leisurely circling the
deck we talked of those trite subjects
that seem to belong to people who first
meet yet my heart was even then cry-
ing out to tell her of the great love that
lay within it

  a school of leaping porpoise keeping
up to the ship off the port side caught
her interest and she leaned over the rail
watching them she laughed with
spontaneous joy at their sportive antics

  arent they dear she exclaimed
and several women passengers standing
near by cast looks of amazement and
horror upon her

  i believe she did murder her hus-
band  whispered one of the group
spitefully to her companion did you
hear her laugh

  if elizabeth heard the words stie gave
no sign of it in fact she laughed
again freely and unrestrainedly but

as we moved away i saw that her
sweet eyes were filled with tears it
was after this incident which set me
inwardly boiling that she seemed to
lose heart in talking so i persuaded
her to let me get her cozily tucked in
her steamer chair for a siesta on deck

  she seemed grateful for the sugges-
tion and when she was comfortably
settled and courtlandt had hurried to
the library to get a book for her i
joined larkins again and we betook
ourselves to the upper deck making
our way to the smoking room aft on
the way we encountered the first offi-
cer very handsome and striking-looic-
ing in his white duck uniform he
paused to chat with us a moment and
to put a question to larkins

  what did you think of hallarons
story he asked

  i think it was pretty straightfor-
ward on the whole larkins replied

  he told one lie however an-
nounced woodruff in a lowered tone

  larkins led him to the rail and the
three of us looked down into the blue
of the sea churned into white foam by
the mighty propellers fire away
he said after he was sure no one could
overhear us

  hallaron swore that he was in his
bunk when the shot was fired said
woodruff yet one of the engineers
force who was forward taking the air
just before his watch was called tetts
me he saw hallaron on deck and peer-
ing into the window of stateroom a
not five minutes before the shot was
fired

  larkins was startled and for sev-
eral minutes of complete silence he
gazed into the depths of the sea so in-
tently that i wondered if he expected
those churning waters to furnish him
with a solution of this latest develop-
ment

  thats odd he said at last have
you told the captain

  not yet said woodruff but i
will- at eight bells when i do my turn
on the bridge-it is nearly time now
he added consulting his watch

  the deck lights were extinguished
thb phantom shotgun



said larkins so how could this en-
gineer tell it was hallaron

  he said there was light streaming
through the window of stateroom a
and as hallaron had his face in close
proximity he is certain of the identifi-
cation furthermore this engineer
maintains that when he and the rest of
the watch started to the scene some
moments after the shot had been heard
he met hallaron and asked what was
up

  it looks as if your theory of the
whole affair was right larkins i ob-
served

  i never had a theory-that is i
never expressed one retorted the
newspaper man turning to me

  didnt you think hallaron shot
forbes i asked in surprise

  if i did i didnt think out loud
was larkins evasive answer

  come up on the bridge well have
more privacy suggested woodruff
its my time up there and anyway
the captain will be glad to hear what
new views you may have arrived at
and we walked forward to the ladder
leading to the bridge

  captain loyd welcomed us pleasant-
ly and plunged at once into the subject
which was absorbing every one to the
exclusion of every other topic

  i am more deeply puzzled and mys-
tified than ever declared the captain
and by the way the company ha or-
dered me to bury the body at sea with
mrs forbes permission it shall be
done at sunset

  then woodruff told the captain of
the engineers story about hallarons
presence on deck just prior to the
shooting

  so it was hallaron after all ex-
claimed captain loyd springing to his
feet

  i do not think so captain said
larkins

  why not

  you forget the cipher warning

  do you really believe the cipher had
anything to do with his death  i
asked

  i certainly do maintained larkins

emphatically it threw a man utterly
devoid of nerves into a paroxysm of
fear he declared that hidden among
the figures was a threat of death to be
carried out that very night was he
right

  we could say nothing to this and
unlocking a drawer in his desk cap-
tain loyd withdrew the cipher that had
been found on forbes bed

 larkins pored over it in silence for a
miile then asked permission to make a
copy of it so that he could study it
more closely at his leisure

  at that i dont think this cipher
will tell us anything we dont know
he remarked as he slipped the copy he
had made into his pocket and de-
spite the fact that hallaron was on
deck i dont believe he ever owned a
shotgun

  then said the captain you re-
gard the weapon as the pivot around
which-

  in this affair the shotgun is x-the
unknown quantity now we must fig-
ure everything from that standpoint
let us tabulate those who might be
guilty taking mrs forbes first

  let us ask ourselves would she
have any motive in killing her hus-
band the answer is yes but-a
shotgun is no part of a brides trous-
seau no matter how up to date brides
are these days granted she had cause
however it is utterly ridiculous in this
case to suppose she shot him when she
could have procured her freedom
minus bloodshed and sensationalism
via good old renos route so that
eliminates mrs forbes

  courtlandt now things look dark
for our hot-headed young friend it
was his divine right to kill forbes so
he thought but somebody else saved
him the trouble his confession as
well as mrs forbes was the merest
piffle each got the idea the other was
guilty so tried to shoulder the respon-
sibility the fact that the inside of a
stateroom was torture to any one who
had gone through the mental agony
courtlandt had endured during the day
made his presence on deck nothing out
of the ordinary i want you to bear


the popular magazine

this in mind and figure it out with me
according to where he was standing
when the chief engineer saw him-and
the engineer didnt lose any time in
moving forward when he heard the
shot-it was a physical impossibility
for courtlandt to have fired the shot
but he was noticeably agitated so
mr mcdonald affirmed put in the
captain

  yes said larkins that puzzled
ine until i had a heart-to-heart talk
with him this afternoon poor fellow
he believes mrs forbes fired the shot 
what made him believe that de-
manded the captain

  his stateroom is twenty-two open-
ing off the cross companionway on the
port side of the ship he did not go
out on deck there but walked through
the ship to the starboard side as he
came to the junction of the companion-
way that runs fore and aft he looked
toward the front part of the vessel in
the dim light he saw what he thought
was a womans figure clad in a loose-
flowing kimono in front of forbes
door he stumbled out on deck agi-
tated and distraught because he be-
lieved it to be none other than mrs
forbes and leaned against the rail
plunged into a maelstrom of emotions
imagine his consternation then when
the shot was fired almost immediately
thereafter leaving only one conviction
open to his mind

  that puts it up to mrs forbes
then said the captain quickly

  not by a jugful it only goes to
prove mrs forbes entire innocence
how

  do you remember the wray she was
gowned when she appeared on the
scene immediately after the discovery
of the murder 

  she was fully dressed by jove i
had forgotten that

  yes said larkins and in a close-
fitting tan-colored gown at that
then that lets her out i said in a
voice so full of obvious relief that i
was annoyed to see larkins suppress a
smile

  exit then mrs forbes and our
quixotic young friend courtlandt

now my impression is that the crime
was committed by some one whose
stateroom opens off or near the social
hall every stateroom on this ship
opens off the interior companion ways
there are no deck staterooms he
purser the chief steward the steward-
ess myself marshall and maybe a half
dozen other passengers were in the lo-
cality near enough to rush out fire the
shot and get back into the safety of
our staterooms before the ship was
aroused

  a nice cheerful thought that i in-
terposed which of us is it up to to
spring to our feet crying dramatically
captain captain i cannot tell a lie
i did it with my little shotgun 
that remains to be discovered re-
torted larkins dryly in the mean-
time to give us suspects the benefit of
the doubt lets work on the hallaron
hypothesis

  hallaron or patton is distinctly in
bad were the detective force of new
york aboard they would fall on mr
hallarons neck and third degree him
to a fare-ye-well but somehow i cant
convince myself that he did the shoot-
ing what do you say to confronting
him with the fact that he was seen at
forbes window 

  a good idea agreed captain loyd
get hallaron mr woodruff

  the first officer was gone but a little
while when he reentered the room with
hallaron briefly the captain told the
deck steward of the engineers story
and asked him to affirm or dispute it
i dont think we were jany of us pre-
pared for his answer

  thats right sir i zvas on deck at
the time that black dog was killed he
said

  and you killed him said larkins
quickly

  hallaron shook his head slowly 
did not sir

  you know who did then  the re-
porter suggested insinuatingly

  yes sir i do know dumfounded
the four of us stared at hallaron but
wild horses couldnt drag it from me
he went on quietly t consider that
-we all hung on the next word-per-
the phantom shotgun



son he added as only doin the task
god sent them to do-

  and nothing-no amount of threats
or cajolery could swerve hallaron
from his determination to keep his
knowledge of the murderer strictly to
himself the thought of being keel-
hauled only made him smile the pros-
pect of a dark dismal hole chained like
a dog and starved earned merely an
indifferent shrug of his shoulders

  theres only one thing ill do sir
said hallaron if an innocent party is
convicted of killin this forbes ill tell
all i knows 

  get out hallaron cried the cap-
tain angrily you actually make me
want to throttle you for a pig-headed
imbecile

  after hallaron had gone the captain
turned to larkins i think hes crazy
he said in disgust

  or just telling the plain unvar-
nished truth which is nearly the same
thing grinned the reporter im go-
ing to cultivate hallarons acquaint-
ance and ill bet any one a doughnut
to a left-handed monkey wrench ill
worm his secret out of him before we
reach new orleans

  and i mentally decided that it was
a pretty safe bet

  that afternoon at sundown all that
was mortal of hamilton forbes was
carefully shrouded weighted and cast
into the deep while captain loyd in
an impressive voice read the burial
service every one on board passen-
gers and crew thronged the side of the
vessel and looked on in silence-a si-
lence terribly profound undisturbed
even by the throb of machinery for the
pounding propellers were still for the
nonce when captain loyd closed his
book he bowed his bared head

  there was a rush through the air a
splash a boiling of white foam and
then the ominous flirt of a dorsal fin as
one of the denizens of the deep fol-
lowed hamilton forbes to his last rest-
ing place

  our solemn duty to the dead over
the gongs clanged their imperative de-
mands in the bowels of the ship the

thrashing screws clove anew the deep
indigo of the gulf stream and we
surged southward

  mrs forbes retired to her stateroom
courtlandt and myself paced the deck
wthile larkins we t above to file over-
night copy as he expressed it later
we found him in the wireless room with
sparks as all on board knew the curly-
headed operator swapping yarns of the
newspaper game i invited the reporter
to join me in a stroll around the decks
but he declined saying that he was go-
ing to lonesome it in his stateroom and
solve the cipher-if he could

  as we reached the saloon deck court-
landt too excused himself and made
off in the direction of his stateroom i
paced the deck alone a full moon
made the waters a shimmering sea of
silver and the passengers crowded the
decks more cheerful and light-hearted
than they had hitherto been now that
forbes body had been consigned to the
keeping of the deep

  it was ten oclock when i left my
steamer chair to seek my bunk the
weather was growing warmer as we
progressed southward and i swung the
glass window wide open and pulled up
the wooden shutter for privacys sake
the steamer chairs belonging to mrs
forbes larkins and myself were oc-
cupied and although i tried to distin-
guish the voices i failed to recognize
any speaker so i decided that some of
the other passengers unknown to me
had taken possession of our chairs for
the time

  i was in my berth when suddenly i
heard hallarons voice i listened in-
tently i could easily make out that he
was telling those in the chairs that the
persons who rented them desired their
use while i could not see the occu-
pants i could tell that they moved off
at once

  next i heard mrs forbes and court-
landt in conversation with hallaron
but later they too got up and moved
away

  from the bridge six bells told the
hour of eleven and i could see the
lights on deck snap out

  suddenly a gunshot rang out on the

chapter ix

the mystery only deetens

 a copy of the new york ledger
lies before me as i write of the ter-
rible mystery of the phantom shotgun
and knowing that larkins account of
that night is far superior to any i could
give i copy it verbatim

  the mystery of the murder of hamilton
forbes the millionaire wall street broker
who was killed on board the s s minerva
has deepened with the killing of a man
named hallaron the deck steward of the
steamship last night the steward met his
fate in the same mysterious manner in which
death claimed the broker

  hallaron whose real name was hugh pat-
ton a convict escaped from sing sing was
found lying in his own blood on the deck of
the ill-fated vessel following the explosion
of a shotgun outside of stateroom a where
forbes met his untimely end the mur-
derer as in the forbes shooting has so
far not been identified

  hallaron was under suspicion for the mur-
der of forbes as mentioned in the wireless
dispatches yesterday and his death by the
same means employed in the killing of ham-
ilton forbes onty deepens the mystery

  hallaron was quite dead when picked up
and a charge of buckshot having riddled
his body showed the weapon to have been
used at short range

  e van buren courtlandt whose spectacu-
lar admittance of guilt in the forbes shoot-
ing has been told of has been placed under
arrest by captain john s loyd the com-
mander of the minerva owing to the fact
that he was only within twenty feet or so
of the murdered deck steward when the shot
was fired

  courtlandt and mrs forbes the widow
of the murdered broker according to their
own testimony were leaning over the for-
ward rail of the minerva when they heard
the roar of the shotgun and both turning
simultaneously beheld hallaron thrashing
about on deck courtlandt rushed to the
stricken man and was giving him what aid
he could when passengers officers and crew
crowded around the spot

  both mrs forbes and courtlandt declare
that they saw no one else on deck although
they turned instantly at the sound of the
weapon exploding the whole length of the
starboard deck was clear so they maintained
and courtlandt gave it as his impression that

some one standing in the forward compan-
ionway that leads to the social hall had
fired the fatal shot

  the purser and the chief steward of
the minerva were talking- with the corre-
spondent of the ledger inside not many feet
from this companionway and it would have
been impossible for any one to have escaped
that way and not harre been seen by these
three

  that some one inside of stateroom a
fired the shot was the generally accepted
theory until a thorough search of tlie room
dispelled any such belief the doors had
been securely locked by the purser and the
keys kept in his possession since the forbes
murder as the new orleans police authori-
ties had requested that nothing be disturbed
until that room should be searched by them
for any possible clews the window of this
stateroom looked out on deck and was open
hallarons body was lying directly beneath
it when he died

  another stateroom number one lying mid-
way between stateroom a and the library
was occupied at the time by franklin mar-
shall a raisin man of fresno cal who is
taking the southern trip on his way to his
home mr marshall was in his berth at
the time and told how the report of the
shotgun awakened him hearing the com-
motion on deck he lowered his window
blind and looked out others were crowd-
ing the deck by this time and he could add
little toward clearing up the latest develop-
ment

  the library stateroom a and all the
staterooms were immediately and thoroughly
ransacked for a weapon but without result

  in arresting mr courtlandt and placing
him in the confinement of his own state-
room captain loyd explained that there
was no other course open to him

  mrs elizabeth kennedy forbes sought
the seclusion of her stateroom immediately
after the occurrence and it was rumored
among the passengers that she too had been
placed in custody captain loyd denies
this however mrs forbes declined to make
any statement for the press

  if the death of mr forbes aroused
the ship to a state of excitement it
could not be compared to the frenzy
of passengers over the halloran trag-
edy

  i advanced the theory of suicide
suggesting that the man had probably
shot himself and pitched the weapon
overboard as he fell

  larkins scouted this and pointed out
that the gun was not held close to the
body as a suicide would be forced to
hold the weapon but at least ten feet
away as the scattered shots in the dead
the phantom shotgun



mans body -and lack of powder burns
clearly testified

  i give it up i said its too deep
for me

  well i dont give it up said the
reporter grimly why id never look
a gumshoe in the face again if i let
this boat get to new orleans without
solving these two murders on the
same boat and a witness almost to
everything and lucky larkins not
clean it up  humph 

  how about the cipher i asked
why do you ask that
overwhelming curiosity i said
the only thing that can throw any
light on these murders is that mass of
figures and i together with every one
on this ship would like to see it de-
ciphered

  larkins mused a while in silence be-
fore he spoke

  well im free to confess im up
against it there it looked like the eas-
iest thing i ever tackled in the way
of ciphers when i started but it wasnt
long before i gave it up see here
and he pulled a lot of papers from his
coat pocket come into the library
and ill show you an alphabetical mix-
up thats like a poor relation of pied
type here is the cipher warning
and he laid the copy before me



           -- - - --ls-

          ---c-	-- -

          ------ -

          -	- - ----

          g- - -- -- - 

                                

  now there are twenty-six letters in
the alphabet and well first transpose
each figure to the letter it represents
supposing i stand stands for a and
 for z said larkins

  then he laid down a second piece of
paper covered with letters instead of
figures



y t b  g i n  t

               ft 
  now i have taken those figures
like so many recruits marched them
to and fro backward and forward
marshaling them into all sorts of form-
ations only to come back to this array
the top line bears out forbes state-
ment in a way

  how i asked very much inter-
ested

  read it from right to left and you
have to-night the y i cant under-
stand yet the bottom line is either
heaven or skipping h and e it is
avenger 

  isnt it strange that the words you
have deciphered were so easy and those
that remain hidden are so difficult i
asked

  that makes it a cipher larkins
retorted dryly

  what about the s within the cir-
cle i inquired

  that is either a signature or a sub-
key-i dont know which at first i
thought it might mean that the reader
was to follow the form of the letter s
through the letters but thats not the
answer

  then you give it up

  not by a jugful i shall eat sleep
and exercise with this thing until i
solve it and he swept the papers up
suggesting a stroll on deck

larkins solves the cipher

  at dinner elizabeth forbes appeared
in the dining salbon for the first time
during the trip joining captain loyd
and myself at the first table and we
carried on a fairly lively conversation
larkins appeared when we were about
half through he was smiling and deb-
onair as usual but i could detect a
glint of satisfaction in his eyes

well whats up i asked him

  i have solved the cipher-thats
all and he proceeded to attack a
fritter with undue violence

  of course this statement created
something of a stir in our particular
group and mrs forbes paling a little
asked to see the solution

  sure if it will do you any good
said larkins i felt that if i could
decipher that mess of numerals i would
have the answer to the whole affair
but there is nothing doing he dug
a hand into a pocket and drew out his
copy of the cipher the little number
on the top gives the key the nine-
teenth letter in the alphabet is s the
greek letter s is sigma and with
fine disregard for table linen he drew
the letter thereon

  by jove exclaimed captain loyd
the very mark that was on the wall of
mr forbes stateroom and that threw
him into a spasm of fear

  how does that explain the cipher
asked mrs forbes

  ill show you said the newspaper
man producing another sheet of paper
it was the one with the numbers
changed to their corresponding letters
i merely follow the form of sigma
through the different rows reading
each letter as i go along there-he
suited the action to the word-what
do you make of it

   to-night you die the avenger 
read the captain with painstaking dis-
tinctiveness but we knew approxi-
mately that much already mr lar-
kins he turned on the reporter in
an aggrieved manner this doesnt
throw any light on the mystery what
we want is the final solution

  oh you do said the reporter
blandly how very odd well i
dont mind admitting that im in the
same boat with you but ive done my
derndest and angels cant do more
that being so-i am going to have ice
cream and my nearly peach pie all in
one dish

  what will you do next i asked
since you counted so much on the so-
lution of the cipher doesnt this leave
you high and dry

  well it might look that way but
you must remember that i am amphib-
ious

  we all arose at the same time and
made our way on deck larkins bring-
ing up the rear humming over and
over again with deadly monotony

   she got down on her knees

    and sighed bejeez

    but the vill-i-an still pursued her
the phantom shotgun



  he suddenly stopped i suppose we
ought to go and watch courtlandt
feed he said as we fell in step be-
hind the captain and elizabeth only
we have such a horny-handed old son
of a sea cook for a skipper that he
would suspect that i was going to slip
the desperate prisoner a jagged meat
saw by which said desperate prisoner
would gain the freedom of the deck
and swim three miles to yonder sand
key and hide behind a dune

  captain loyd made no retort but
when we were on the port side of the
saloon deck he entered the aft com-
panionway and knocked at stateroom
twenty-two

  may we visit you mr courtlandt 
he asked pleasantly i have some of
your friends with me

  for answer courtland himself flung
open the door his face lit up as he
saw who was there besides the cap-
tain larkins and myself

  welcome to my dungeon  cried the
young fellow and i observed the look
of gratitude elizabeth flashed at the
captain when she discovered that
courtlandt was not under lock and key
the five of us stuffed the little place
uncomfortably and so i suggested to
the captain that a turn on deck for the
prisoner would be nothing more than
humane but captain loyd shook his
head

  i have been ordered by my supe-
riors to keep mr courtlandt in custody
and i must do so despite the fact that
i am practically convinced that our
young friend could not have been
guilty

  oh im all right here anyway
spoke up the accused man nonchalantly
the captain has been more than good
and as he has pointed out the federal
authorities in new orleans will un-
doubtedly arrest me merely because my
presence on the ship is against me but
i am innocent and im not one bit dis-
turbed

  oh van dont speak of arrest
almost sobbed the girl completely los-
ing consciousness of our presence in
her agitation

  it isnt so bad courtlandt con-

  b

tinued and dont you folks worry
atxjut my situation i read most of the
time he pointed to a pile of books
strewn over the lower bunk the first
officer sent in this bunch and im prom-
ising myself a great treat to-night with
this particular book and he held up
a volume by a popular writer

  but can you see well enough in here
with that one little light asked the

girl-

  that one incandescent is plenty if
he occupies the upper berth put in
the captain

  courtlandt laughed thats a queer
thing about me he said but do you
know i never like an upper berth i
object to the climbing part even on a
boat

  as i opened the door to lead the way
out i found woodruff in front of the
door he flushed as i hailed him and
hurriedly told the captain that there
were wireless messages to be answered
from the company offices i could not
get over the impression that i had
caught woodruff eavesdropping as the
three of us walked around to where our
chairs were located but there in si-
lence we fell under the spell of the june
moon which had just risen over the
edge of the sea throwing a mist of sil-
very light over the waters in front of
the sharp-nosed bow of the minerva

  toward nine oclock mr woodruff
joined us and then mcdonald the
chief engineer wandered up and we
discussed the sea her variable ways
history and superstitions

  aye you may weel laugh at a sail-
ors supersteetions said mcdonald in
his rich voice tinged with a scotch
brogue while im a mon wha does
na believe in ghosts an sic things still
ill confess that i believe an i pay heed
tae signs th day we left new york
a shark nosed along in our wake
miguel says i to one of my cuban
wipers did ye ever see a shark so far
north before no senor says the
wiper some one die thisa day an
by that i ken that miguel is a true
sailor even if he isna a presbyterian
that business of mr forbes happened
that nicht yesterday who should i


the popular magazine

see every time i come on deck mr
shark tumblin along in our wake x-ast
nicht hallaron met his end--an doesna
that prove onything

  i looked at larkins and caught him
in the act of winking at the first offi-
cer who to my surprise did not return
the wink

  see your old chum to-day asked
the reporter touching a match to a
fresh cigarette

  i did sir answered mcdonald at
which mrs forbes stirred uneasily and
i felt a queer sensation along my spine
he wtas showin his dorsal fin every
time i looked aft an in my opeenion
th old minerva is marked by davy
jones an im no a croaker sir

  no indeed larkins hastily as-
sured him you are bubbling over
wtith joy and optimism any one lis-
tening to your cheering reflections
could feel nothing but carefree and
light of heart

  thank ye sir said the engineer
earnestly and without the slightest de-
gree of sarcasm

  later larkins woodruff and mc-
donald moved off toward the rear of
the ship where on the aft freight hatch
a sound of a concertina and shuffling
of feet proclaimed that the wipers
stokers and assistant engineers were
having their days relaxation in the
balmy tropic air i stayed writh mrs
forbes and we talked of many sub-
jects every one quite remote from the
incidents of the last two days

  the first shock of what she had
passed through was wrearing away and
her true nature blossomed forth like
a rose as she reclined in her chair
i stole secret glances at the charming
picture she made in her crisp white
duck suit and natty yachting cap
touched to even a snowier whiteness
by the magic of the moon

  i wonder what power it is that gov-
erns the law of attraction-that often
lifts us breathless and amazed from the
highways and byways of lifes com-
monplaces to that highest pinnacle of
human emotions which men call love
here was i a sedate and middle-aged
man hitherto untouched by charm of

any woman crabbed and crusty i sup-
pose as a result of my lonely bache-
lorhood and singularly unresponsive
nature suddenly enamored of a woman
many years my junior who had come
upon this vessel a bride and was ob-
viously in love with another man

  it seemed to me that all the passion
that had found no outlet in me before
was crying aloud in every drop of blood
-was flaming in my eyes and blazoned
upon my eager lips-and as i leaned
forward carried away with the mad-
ness of my infatuation elizabeth
turned and her gaze level and oh in-
finitely sweet and pitying met mine

  she reached out one slim white hand
and laid it upon my arm dear
friend she said gently love has been
offered to me always and always it
has brought me nothing but sorrow i
want friendship-the strong honest
friendships of a strong honest man-
for it is my greatest need of all things
now and so i ask for yours knowing
though i met you but two days ago
that no worthier or sweeter gift could
come my way will you be-my
friend 

  i was an old man suddenly i felt
my age upon me-the fire died from
my heart and my eyes and the thought
of courtlandt whose vibrant youth had
called to hers and drawn her yielding
heart to his own sickened me with de-
spair but i took the hand she offered
and held it close for a golden moment
while i pledged my friendship as ear-
nestly as could a broken old man who
had asked for bread and received a
stone

chapter xi

the ledgers version

  the reverberation had scarcely died
away before l sprang from my bed
seized my cane and scantily costumed
in my bath robe joined the running
panting throng that was crowding the
passageway

  that fiendish weapon of death had
spoken again and this time it seemed
that every passenger on board frayed
of nerves and painfully on the alert in
consequence had roused to instant ac-
the phantom shotgun



tion and poured from the staterooms
like so many ants from a disturbed hill
small chance had any criminal to es-
cape unseen this time thought i when
larkins flying past with the tail of his
bizarre dressing down flapping gro-
tesquely around his thin shanks
hitched his arm in mine and rushed
me along with him

  courtlandts been shot he panted
courtlandt-do you hear oh mar-
shall if hes dead that devilish instru-
ment has done for one of the best fel-
lows i know

  but that young courtlandt was not
dead is evident from larkins detailed
account of the affair which i have
clipped from the ledger

  mystery upon mystery accumulates on the
s s minerva an attack has been made
on the life of e van buren courtlandt
who is under suspicion as the murderer of
hamilton forbes and the deck hand pat-
ton alias hallaron while the attack on
mr courtlandt has not resulted in a fa-
tality it has thrown the passengers of the
big ship into a riot of frenzy

  courtlandts escape from instant death was
nothing short of miraculous and the fact
that he was not even wounded hardly seems
believable the weapon used was evidently
the same instrument that caused the death of
forbes and hallaron-the mysterious shot-
gun 

  according to the story told by the young
new yorker he was awakened by a thun-
derous noise and the pungent odor of burn-
ing powder in his nostrils his stateroom
was in total darkness until the door was
opened by the first officer of the ship albert
h woodruff who before entering had
called out courtlandts name

  being answered by the occupant of the
stateroom the first officer turned the knob
and was surprised to find the door unlocked
entering followed by the members of the
crew a few passengers and the ledgers
correspondent on the ship courtlandt in his
pajamas and looking dazed and bewildered
was found sitting on the edge of the upper
berth he was unhurt

  the bed coverings and pillows of the
lower berth had been nearly torn to shreds
by the charge from the gun and had court-
landt been sleeping there he would have
been killed outright

  from the shot found in the woodwork
of the berth it was easily ascertained that
the weapon had been aimed through the
small window of the stateroom and that the
holder of the shotgun stood on deck and
fired from that spot

  courtlandt said after the shooting that his
escape from death was a very narrow one

his habit so he explained has been to al-
ways sleep in the lower berth but on this
occasion he was reading and to get proper
illumination he had climbed into the upper
berth as this brought him nearer the electric
light that is attached to the ceiling of the
stateroom while reading courtlandt says
he fell asleep and waking about eleven
oclock or later to find the light still burn-
ing pushed the switch button with his foit
plunging the room in darkness then he
fell into a sound slumber until awakened
by the shot

  investigation showed that the black-and-
white buttons that switch on and off the
current are located at the foot of the upper
berth and  the young suspect could have
easily manipulated the buttons as he de-
scribed

  this the third shooting on board the
minerva since leaving new york has thrown
the passengers of the boat into a state bor-
dering on panic this is particularly the
case as applied to the women passengers
many of whom are keeping to the seclusion
of their staterooms declaring their inten-
tion of remaining there until new orleans
is reached

  to add to the general discomfort trouble
is looked for from the members of the
crew the cuban element of which the
engineering and stoker forces are mostly
composed are imbued with a fear of the
supernatural as evidenced by the series of
crimes that have visited the vessel and
while there have been no serious disturb-
ances the officers are going armed and will
take stern measures in suppressing any out-
break

  captain loyd has been importuned to
make a landing when the minerva passes
key west to-day but the commander has
announced that it is his intention to con-
tinue on to the crescent city unless his
company advises him differently

  the mystery of the deadly shotgun has
cropped out again at the time of the death
of the escaped convict hallaron it was
thought that the weapon had been thrown
overboard either by hallaron if he had sui-
cided or by his murderer the boat officials
had decided that such was the fate of the
weapon until the attempt this morning on
the life of courtlandt blasted that hope

  the first officer of the ship albert h
woodruff assisted by the crew and the two
stewardesses have once more searched the
ship from crows nest to keelson and from
bow to stern but the hiding place of the
shotgun has not been discovered

  rumors deductions suggestions and sus-
picions are rife many of the ships passen-
gers are one in their belief that courtlandt
fired this latest shot in his own stateroom to
divert suspicion from himself and then
by throwing the gun over the side destrored
the most important piece of evidence in the
triple mystery


the popular magazine

  the shooting presents the same baffling as-
pect as the others because while not every
one aboard had retired those on deck could
see no one who carried a shotgun or in any
way roused suspicion

  the only bit of evidence to have the
slightest weight is that of one of the crew
his name is henry farrell an englishman
farrell was on the promenade deck which
is the one directly above the saloon deck
where courtlandts stateroom is located the
seaman says he was going aft after bring-
ing a cup of coffee to the man at the wheel
on the bridge and had been told to turn in

  farrell is positive he heard footsteps on
the saloon deck and thinking it was one of
the crew took no further notice of it he
said he stretched himself out on one of the
passengers steamer chairs and was filling
his pipe preparatory to a smoke as smoking
is strictly forbidden in the quarters

  suddenly there was the loud report of the
shotgun from the deck directly beneath him
farrell sprang to the rail and endeavored to
peer under but could see nothing more than
the railing of the lower deck according to
this member of the crew nothing was thrown
over the side as he would have been in a
position to have seen such an act or to
have heard the splash of any such object
as a shotgun striking the water as the
footsteps left the deck farrell rushed for-
ward and ran down the main stairway in
the fore part of the ship and when he
reached the saloon deck he saw mrs forbes
the widow of the broker who was killed
the first day out standing in the door of
her stateroom with a look of horror on
her face the seaman says the next pas-
sengers he saw were too numerous to men-
tion as every one seemel to pour from their
respective staterooms the next moment

  farrell claimed that the person he heard
running from the sound of the footfalls
undoubtedly wore shoes as the heels strik-
ing the deck made a loud noise

  mrs forbes was dressed in a long flowing 
wrapper and wore slippers she explained
that she had passed a restless night and
was awake and lying in her berth when
the explosion reached her ears she at once
sprang up slipped on a wrapper and opened
her door just in time to see the man farrell
running down the stairs from the upper
dcck she said she heard no one running
along the deck and was positive no one en-
tered the companionway after she opened
her door when questioned as to her abil-
ity to have heard any one running on deck
she admits it would have been possible for
the running to have occurred without her
hearing the footfalls as her stateroom win-
dow was closed tight and sounds do not
easily penetrate into her suite

  captain loyd is inclined to credit court-
landts story that some one made an at-
tempt on his life there seems to be little
doubt that the person who killed forbes and

hallaron is likewise responsible for the fir-
ing of the latest shot

  with every revolution of the propellers
driving the ship southward the mystery
grows deeper

muttekings of mutiny

  i had fallen asleep in my berth fully
dressed when i awoke with drowsy
consciousness of something unusual in
the air i listened intently my eyes
straining into the darkness and heart
pounding uncomfortably

 what was wrong

  stillness reigned everywhere not a
cry not a sound came to my ears i
lay in my berth puzzled and mystified
w hat had caused me to awake so sud-
denly and so thoroughly

  with a cry i sprang to my feet as
the truth flashed upon me

  the minerva was no longer in mo-
tion 

  the throb throb throb of the mighty
shafts that revolved the propellers was
stilled and the big ship floated a list-
less mass of iron on the swelling bosom
of the moonlit gulf

  i made my way to the deck but as
i stumbled out of the companionway i
was stopped by a burly irishman one
of the boatswains

  no one allowed on deck he told
me barring my way with a brawny
arm-

  what is the trouble  i asked

  what trouble it was larkins
who spoke and whom i now saw for
the first time he wras on deck lean-
ing against the rail smoking

  why has the ship stopped i de-
manded

  thirsty and wanted a drink he
replied

  i ignored larkins flippancy why
is it im not allowed on deck since mr
larkins is  i demanded of the boat-
swain

  larkins chuckled you see he
said ive showed the officer my fire
badge and police card besides war
correspondents can go anywhere

stammered what do you mean

  s-s-s-sh the reporter warned and
motioning me out on deck he whis-
pered  there is trouble in the engine
room-the cubans are demanding that
the boat put to shore the thing we
feared-superstition-has them all in
its clutches

 then you think-

  there will be no bloodshed inter-
posed larkins captain loyd is a
wise level-headed man and instead of
grabbing up a marlinespike and smash-
ing a few skulls he is pursuing a more
modern and tactful policy-reasoning
with his mutinous crewr larkins sud-
denly peered down the deck there
comes the captain now

  i looked aft and saw the white-uni-
formed figure of captain loyd strid-
ing along the deck he was followed
by half a dozen cuban stokers nearly
all of them begrimed from coal dust
and stripped to their waists their
swarthy skins shining a dull yellow un-
der the pale illumination of the deck
lights mcdonald and woodruff
brought up the rear

  they turned in the companionway
where we stood going to the door of
stateroom a the first officer after
selecting a key from the bunch he car-
ried unlocked and threw open the door
of the mysterious room where forbes
met his death and in front of which
hallaron the deck steward was killed
at the doorway the cubans halted
and each crossed himself devoutly as
woodruff stepped inside and pressing
an electric button flooded the place
with light

  in ye go ye lubbers and look yer
blasted eyes out bellowed mcdonald
as the stokers hesitated on the thresh-
old

  easy there mr mcdonald said
captain loyd sternly i want no driv-
ing i promised these men that they
could enter this room and see for them-
selves that nothing is hidden here
now you men look with your own
eyes

  i moved ground near larkins to get
a better view of the mutineers and
found the reporter leaning carelessly up
against the white-painted wall of the

stateroom his hands thrust in his trou-
sers pockets bored and uninterested it
seemed 

  well demanded the captain of the
six cowering stokers do you see any-
thing 

  si senor el capitan piped up one
of the half dozen in a very small voice
we see the death

  you see rubbish bellowed the cap-
tain the room has been locked since
the removal of the body and no one
could get in here what do you men
expect to find in this room-ghosts 
ive humored you by permitting a
picked number of you to come and ex-
amine this stateroom youve seen it
now you go back to your duties or
ill lock every one of you in irons

  the leader of the six turned to his
comrades and in a rapid-fire volley of
spanish translated the captains words
to the four who could not understand
english this done they made no com-
ment and mcdonald ordered them on
deck they obeyed filing through the
companionway and congregating in
front of the window of stateroom a

  larkins followed the officers on
deck but i-not liking the expression
i saw in the cubans eyes-took up my
station in front of mrs forbes state-
room opposite figuring that if any-
thing happened i could be there ready
to aid or reassure her

  from the deck i could hear the voice
of captain loyd ordering the stokers
to their work there was a brief in-
terval of silence then larkins voice
cried out sharply

  look out for that knife cap
then a sounding smack telling me
as well as if i had witnessed it that
somebodys fist had connected writh
somebodys jaw the sound of a falling
body a revolver shot followed by the
pur of an automatic pistol and a cuban
oath

chapter xiii

the shock of battle

  i subsequently learned the incidents
which led up to the tragic event on
deck from mr woodruff and his ac-
count in the main was as follows


the popular magazine

  the stokers after their inspection of
the stateroom where forbes had been
killed filed sullenly out on deck the
captain woodruff mcdonald and
larkins followed them to where they
congregated a scowling muttering
group just outside the companionway
one of them-mendez-rattled off an
outburst of violent spanish to his
mates

 go below commanded captain
loyd his patience exhausted

  the men turned as if to leave but
two of the cubans did not move fast
enough for the chief engineer and
reaching out his long muscular arms
the scotchman grabbed the cringing
cubans by their necks and brought
their heads crashing together

  at this act of violence mendez
swung suddenly on his heels whipped
out a long knife from his shirt and
attempted to plunge it in the captains
back larkins cry of alarm warned
the captain of the impending danger
then the reporter knocked the cuban
flat on his back with a well-directed
blow on the chin woodruff the first
officer immediately drew his revolver
and shot a knife out of the hand of an-
other of the mutineers who had drawn
it with the intention of stabbing mc-
donald who was hustling the two stok-
ers he had collared down the deck to-
ward the quarters aft

  mendez after measuring his length
on the deck arose and ran forward
shrieking in spanish in answer to his
cries the main body of stokers who
had congregated near the engine-room
hatch rushed forward to where the of-
ficers were trying to subdue the re-
maining three of those who had visited
stateroom a

  as the main body of cubans left the
hatchway aft captain loyd drew his
automatic pistol and swept the iron-
work above the mutineers heads with
a rain of lead howls from those who
received the ricocheting missiles and
the wreaths of smoke curling around
the officers weapons suddenly quelled
the revolt and the stokers scrambled
off the deck into the hatchways scurry-
ing like rats to safety

  mendez howling in insane frenzy
raced back from the bow of the ship
and was upon the captain before any
of those on deck were aware of his
return captain loyd thrust his pistol
in the cubans face and pulled the
trigger but no discharge followed the
force of the stokers onslaught threw
the commander to the deck and the
pistol that he had previously emptied
was useless other than a club

  three times the captain brought the
automatic crashing on the cubans
head but the grip the stoker had
around his commanders body prevent-
ed captain loyd from landing a finish-
ing blow mendez had his knife close-
ly clutched in his left hand and as the
two tusseled he managed to transfer
it to his right

  the younger cuban however was
no match for his commander and the
latter managed to rise to his feet and
drove the cuban to his knees with a
well-aimed blow then stepping back
to better brace himself for the next on-
slaught the captain tripped over the
projecting part of a steamer chair and
fell heavily mendez with a blood-
curdling cry of rage and savageness
raised his knife and launched forward
larkins woodruff and mcdonald all
this time had their hands full with the
remaining five stokers and it looked as
if nothing could prevent captain
loyds death

  succor came from an unexpected
quarter for just as mendez flung him-
self at the prostrate commander there
was a great spurt of flame and a thun-
derous discharge from the window of
stateroom a and mendez crumpled up
on the deck

  the phantom shotgun had spoken
again

  it seemed like an intervention of
providence concluded woodruff
the five cubans ceased struggling in
our grasp and broke into hysterical
prayer at this juncture the scantily
clad passengers some armed and
others carrying their belongings
poured out on deck the first to ar-
rive on the scene was mr courtlandt
who sprang through the companionway
the phantom shotgun



next to stateroom a it was he who
assisted captain loyd to his feet

  -the commander thereupon inquired
the reason for his being out of his state-
room the young suspect stammered
that he heard the sound of fighting and
raced to the scene to offer what aid he
could the commander peremptorily
ordered him back to his stateroom it
was at this point mr marshall that i
asked you to watch the door of state-
room a

  i omitted to say that it was wthile
captain loyd was ordering the rest of
the crew to place the mutineers in irons
that woodruff asked me to watch the
door of the mysterious stateroom he
and the captain sprang into the inte-
rior of the ship and the first officer
fiung open the door of stateroom a

  it was empty

  exhausted from his rough encoun-
ter with mendez the captain turned the
search for the weapon and its handler
over to the first officer and sought his
quarters near the bridge

  within five minutes from his arrival
on the bridge the vessel was once more
in motion the throbbing pulse of the
great shafts shaking the ship as the
fanlike propellers forced it towrard its
destination it was not until morning
however that there was anything like
composure among the passengers the
incidents of the night coupled with the
crimes of the past few days played
havoc with the nerves of almost every
one on board and knots of the passen-
gers discussed the mysterious reappear-
ance of the phantom shotgun while
rumors flew thick and fast and de-
ductions and impossible theories were
rife

  it seemed almost farcical for mr
woodruff to again search the ship for
the weapon nevertheless this was
done and once more without re-
sult at the finish of the search the
first officer declared that the stokers
could hardly be blamed for their belief
in a supernatural agency in the long list
of visitations of the phantom shotgun
as even a number of the passengers
were beginning to entertain such a con-
viction

the yellow journalist

  sundays breakfast was a very dis-
mal affair none of the officers ap-
peared in the dining saloon and their
absence only caused a greater uneasi-
ness among the passengers larkins
however was at his place when i ar-
rived at our table and the excitement
of the night had made no perceptible
difference in his appetite

  did you remain up to write  i
asked diverting his attention from the
pancakes he was submerging in a flood
of maple sirup

  not i he replied i caught up
with some lost sleep the ledger be-
lieves in remembering the sabbath to
keep it wholly to save up scandal for
the morrow i am reserving my ener-
gies until evening so as to prepare my
copy for the first edition that comes
out on the street at seven a m

  how are the stokers behaving i
queried

  eating out of the hand laughed
the reporter after fhis mornings ex-
perience they are about as warlike as
a flock of eggs say marshall ive
been up against some queer proposi-
tions in my time but this phantom
shotgun thing has certainly got me run-
ning around in circles

  have you talked to the captain
about it

  larkins shook his head no thank
you the poor old cap has trouble
enough without jabbing the hools into
him when it isnt necessary say but
didnt that last shot take the starch out
of those colorado maduro guys
though 

  larkins drummed his long fingers
on the tablecloth for a while and
glanced out of the portholes onto the
blue of the sea how that marksman
and his now-you-see-it-now-you-dont
shotgun ever got into the stateroom
without you seeing him gets me he
said musingly he she or it seized
the opportunity wlcn you were in the
hallway of mrs forbes suite reas-
suring her as to the sounds of fighting
on deck-slipped in the door which


the popular magazine

woodruff failed to relock after exhibit-
ing it to the stokers fired the shot that
saved captain loyds life and then
mingled with the rest of the passengers
and crew when they piled out on deck
that is my idea of it i said but
where did he hide his shotgun

  lets go out on deck said the re-
porter and listen to what the sad sea
waves are saying they may tell you--
i cant

  as we reached the deck the beautiful
sabbath day burst upon us in all its
tropical glory and a light wind per-
fumed with the scents of foliage and
herbage it gathered as it passed over
florida and the southern states swept
the decks balmily

  this is great said larkins as we
fell in step for our usual stroll and
presently we found elizabeth forbes in
her steamer chair and she joined us as
we circled the deck in company lar-
kins bubbled over with the thought that
we were sailing in historic waters and
regaled us with harrowing tales of cap-
tain kidd henry morgan and others
of their ilk

  but remonstrated elizabeth i
thought this was the gulf of mexico
the head of the class for yours
replied the reporter better than that
it is-or rather was-the spanish
main i have great hopes of a long
low rakish craft stealing over the hori-
zon firing a round shot across our bow
throwing grappling hooks unto us and
the whole crew boarding the minerva
with every man arrayed in crinoline pa-
jamas and brandishing a broadsword
a cutlass or two in his belt a dagger
between his teeth and a horse pistol
in his left hand then we should fall
upon them with pike and marlinespike
and have such a nice sociable little
time 

  elizabeth shuddered and cast ap-
pealing glances at me

  dont let that yellow journalist
frighten you i hastened to say hes
so used to having his imagination work-
ing overtime that even when he is not
on duty he cant help dreaming night-
mares

  whos a yellow journalist the
newspaper man demanded

  you are laughed elizabeth im
not color blind

  and now youve gone back on me
larkins indicated that he was moved
to tears- have i not been your
friend am i not still

  that is because i am not where i
can read all that you are printing about
me and her voice took on a serious
note

  my dear mrs forbes- began

the reporter

  no mr larkins dont-please
dont i know what your paper is and
i can imagine the things that it has
been printing about me the past week
my family has been dragged into the
public print my poor old mother half
blind and infirm has been besieged by
the men of your paper threatened lied
to and cajoled into giving out state-
ments that could not throw any light
upon the terrible mystery that has hap-
pened aboard this ship

  pictures of me have illumined the
front pages illustrating articles that
have been written out of whole cloth
as to my past life special women writ-
ers have written thousands of words
as to my mental state at this time a
series of atrocious pen-and-ink sketches
are presenting a story of the great mys-
tery in pictures other columns are
figuring out how much i shall inherit
of mr forbes fortune and what i
shall do with it and who my next
husband will be oh i know the
ledger and i hate it

  larkins listened to her in silence
you merely have the wrong viewpoint
i think he said i dont think you
know the ledger

  know it oh mr larkins i know
it too well for even you to attempt to
champion it it rs a newspaper that
grows fat on scandal which respects no
ethics of legitimate journalism a paper
that offends against good taste and de-
grades the standards of morality the
ledger redresses by virtue of glaring
type more of the wrongs of humanity
than you can keep count of but it adds
to the sum of humanitys ills by an
the phantom shotgun



alluring treatment of social sin the
ledger poses as the friend of the poor
people but any quack or financial hum-
bug bent on stealing the dollars of the
poor can buy its advertising columns
it prates about the rights of the in-
dividual but respects the rights of
none

  your paper has no conscience it
has no standards it has no morals it
has no shame it has no pity it pan-
ders to prurient curiosity and makes
vice attractive while it appears to con-
demn it it creates false impressions
of life and gives a disjointed view of
lifes most serious and sacred prob-
lems in its eager play for patronage
it throws sops to the catholic jew and
other denominational bodies and races

and-

   gets away with it broke in lar-
kins as elizabeth paused for breath
a newspaper should reflect the news
of the world for all to see he que-
ried

  that of course replied eliza-
beth

  anything that reflects is a mirror
he pursued

  she nodded of course again

  well and larkins permitted him-
self to smile for the first time when
you look into a mirror and do not
like the face it reflects you do not
smash the mirror to bits do you 
and he looked so innocently trium-
phant that we both laughed at his ab-
surd conceit and elizabeth called him
a very vain and a very good-natured
boy

  i suppose we all three noticed the
change in captain loyds usually ruddy
face as he came along the deck the
lines in his face were drawn and hag-
gard and the skin almost as white as
his hair his attempt at a smile as we
stopped him was almost pathetic lar-
kins was blunt

  hello captain you look like the
frayed-out end of a rope

  there was a suspicious gleam in cap-
tain loyds steel-gray eyes as he flashed
them on the reporter wthy he
snapped

  why repeated larkins because

you do you look as if you hadnt had
a wink of sleep in a milliotf years this
phantom shotgun thing is getting to
absorb too much of your time id
heave it overboard if i were you

  yes thats it air larkins said the
captain hurriedly the thought of
that dreadful wreapon being still on
board and not knowing whom it will
claim next has me worried then he
excused himself and went aft

  poor old dear said elizabeth as
the commander walked out of hearing

  grand old liar snorted larkins
elizabeth looked at him reproachfully
there is something bothering him and
its not a mythical shotgun or a hand-
ful of muy malo hombres there is
something big and dangerously wrong
on this ship or im a bunk prophet

  i looked at him inquiringly

  when i asked the captain just now
if the phantom shotgun was worrying
him he seemed greatly relieved and
the thought that i wras guessing wrong
lifted a load from his mind another
thing immediately after the riot on
deck this morning captain loyd com-
menced to worry about something he
did not go to bed nor did one of the
crew that was over ten hours ago
and with every round of the minute
hand he has been growing older -and
more haggard even the first officer-
woodruff-who is naturally devoid of
nerves is as agitated as an old hen with
young chicks every member of the
crew is tiptoeing around with secret
written all over their faces thats
enough for me

  we all fell silent and listened the
steady throbbing of the big propeller
shafts was incessant

  nonsense larkins youre worse
than an old woman burst from me
i confess his ominous words affected
me strangely

  all right he answered stretching
his lanky form at full length on his
steamer chair dont call names i
cant help it if something is wrong with
the old tub

  as larkins stopped talking eliza-
beth turned and the next moment


the cpocpulacr magazine

sprang to her feet with a glad cry on
her lips

  i glanced up to see courtlandt walk-
ing down the deck toward us

chapter xv

the empty shell

  hello van drawled larkins i
didnt think theyd let anything as dan-
gerous as you roam the decks without
a muzzle

  courtlandt laughed lightly and he
stood before us holding the girls hand
tight in his own my heart suddenly
turned to the heaviness of lead as i re-
alized what a splendid couple the two
made-young vibrant and handsome
could i be blamed for not welcoming
him with enthusiasm 

  oh the captain just now poked
his head inside the door of my bastile
and ordered me to do fifteen minutes
on deck

  take my chair van said the re-
porter moving to the empty one on the
other side of mine the young pris-
oner sank into a reclining position be-
side the girl we both loved would
that he was worthy of her was all that
i prayed

  the three of them chatted and
laughed and i was out of it foi all
the notice they took of me my eyes
could not see anything but elizabeths
face as i watched the group in silence 
and the love within me for this woman
flamed brighter and brighter and i
found myself calculating as to what i
would do for her should she ever de-
mand my services and i decided that
i was ready to lay down my life for
her if needs be

  strange what an influence a woman
has on a man she can sway him either
to good or to evil and how would
such a woman as elizabeth forbes in-
fluence me i cogitated as i sat there
wandering idly with my fancies what
all came to me in my daydream i do
not now remember but i do recall the
guilty start i gave when larkins rasp-
ing voice recalled me to mundane
things

  we were having a little argument
said the reporter and supposed up
to the time we found you sleeping that
you were listening to the verbal scrap
and could decide for us

  oh i am to act as a sort of up-to-
date solomon i laughed as the
donkey said i am all ears-go on

  i said that it would have been pos-
sible for some one to have opened
vans door and shot at the lower berth
with just as deadly effect as though

he had-

  hold on bobby put in court-
landt the one who used the shot-
gun would not could not have opened
the door it was fastened with that
patent door fastener that permits it to
open about four or five inches and no
more it presents the same problem as
the shooting over the ventilating slit in
the first affair how do you explain

ar

  same explanation as i gave in the
first blanked if i know 

  what do you say to a stroll around
to air courtlandts stateroom and look
it over i suggested to larkins with
an eye to leaving the two together the
reporter unwound himself from his
steamer chair with avidity

  delighted he said anything to
break the monotony life on this ship
is just one murder after another

 but inspection of twenty-two-
courtlandts room-gained us nothing
and so we idled away a half hour in the
smoking room then larkins an-
nounced his intention of visiting
sparks and left for the wireless room
while i after visiting my room wan-
dered out on deck again our steamer
chairs were deserted for elizabeth and
courtlandt stood at the rail some feet
away looking down into the sea as they
talked

  i believe i dozed a little for while
i was conscious of passengers pacing
the deck and passing the corner where
i sat i do not remember seeing any of
them larkins came along whistling a
little air all out of tune but i did not
open my eyes until his shrill rendition
of the latest plagiarism from tin pan
alley gave way to a prolonged blast
thb phantom shotgun



that gradually died to a few breaths
blown spasmodically through lips that
refused to pucker

  as i eyed him he silently pointed to
the seat of the steamer chair that
courtlandt had occupied it was one
removed from where i sat so i got to
my feet to see the better and nearly fell
back at what i saw

  on the steamer chair lay a shining
brass shotgun shell

  the reporter and i eyed each other
in silence for some moments he
seemed to be trying to read my
thoughts and i tried to read his but
without success

  larkins picked the shell up and as
he held it toward me he spoke a single
word

  empty

  then he turned and surveyed the
broad back of courtlandt as he stood
leaning by the rail his head was close
to-that of the girls and they were deep
in conversation md each other

  here give me that thing i said
suddenly extending my hand for the
empty shell larkins put his hands be-
hind him

  what will you do with it he said
suspiciously

  throw it overboard i exclaimed
but keeping the tones low so that the
two at the rail could not hear where
else should it go hes your friend
and hes all thats dear to that girl-
that is where my interest comes in
you and i are the only ones who know
of it

  i wouldnt throw this thing over-
board or otherwise destroy it were it
found in my grandfathers chair an-
swered larkins what does this
prove anyway

  prove-prove why man coupled
with the other cirbumstantial bits of
evidence that have entwined themselves
about courtlandt this could hang him
i shook with restrained feelings as
i spoke you must have the heart of
a stone if you make public this piece
of evidence isnt he your friend
larkins nodded his head certainly

he is and id do anything for him-

  then throw it overboard i plead-

ed dont shatter that girls faith in

him

  then your theory is to let her marry
a murderer just so she can be happy
larkins laughed shortly i see you
believe that he is the wielder of the
phantom shotgun well mr mar-
shall i dont i know him but i
think that you are a brick and there is
my hand

  we gripped heartily i am going
to put this thing up to van said the
reporter then turn it over to the cap-
tain

  see here larkins rather than let
that girl know of this ill-ill-why
ill confess to losing it myself

  now now don quixote chided
the newspaper man calm yourself
the finding of this empty shell is only
conclusive proof that even though the
weapon is spectral its ammunition is de-
cidedly material at any rate it is the
first clew he then called courtlandt
and both he and elizabeth turned and
came over to where we were standing

  ever see that before asked lar-
kins quietly holding out the damning
clew so that the young fellow could
not fail to see it i watched court-
landts face closely you may be sure
but he did not move a muscle nor did
his eyes betray one glint of guilt

  not that i know of he said slow-
ly  then the realization of what the
reporter was holding between his slim
fingers broke upon his mind the
devil a shotgun shell where did
you get it

  reposing comfortably on the seat
of this steamer chair you have occu-
pied for the past half hour i thought
larkins voice was a little hard as he
explained and when elizabeth cried
out i moved near her

  impossible mr larkins-i do not
believe it she cried this is some
horrid plot against van i do not be-
lieve it she repeated

  i found it there said the reporter
simply keeping his eyes on van buren
courtlandts face

  the accused young man stood like
a stone image utterly incapable of
moving or speaking


the popular magazine

  tears now sprang to elizabeths
eyes and my protecting arm was neces-
sary to lead her to her chair where
once seated she buried her face in her
handkerchief

  thats the strangest thing i ever
heard of bobby-blest if it isnt how
do you suppose it got there 

  i wouldnt be asking you if i knew
flashed back larkins

  why-why-you dont think that i

- stammered courtlandt grasping

larkins ty the arm

  i know you dont know a thing
about it van snapped the newspaper
man the thing was placed here to
throw some more blame on you-you
know youve got a corner on it al-
ready so it was figured a little more
wouldnt hurt now the three of us
have got to put our heads together and
do a little think-tank work and figure
out how this was done

  my heads in such a whirl that i
dont think i could be of the slightest
use admitted courtlandt dropping on
a chair however bobby you go
ahead im putting my trust in you
thanks muttered larkins dryly
now marshall here when i showed
him what i had found was for throw-
ing the shell overboard and keeping our

mouths shut but-

  courtlandt turned on me savagely
i dont thank you for that mr mar-
shall i am guilty of nothing and no
matter how black things may appear
against me i havent sunk low enough
to want my friends to suppress any-
thing-

  oh dry up larkins interrupted
you ought to thank mr marshall for
feeling so decent toward you you can
bet your boots i wouldnt agree to the
suggestion now let us try and figure
out how this shell got here when was
it found it was found when robert
larkins reporter appeared on deck
about fifteen minutes ago wthere was
it it was  the rear of the seat of
the steamer chair occupied some quar-
ter or half half previously by e van
buren courtlandt who else was near
by franklyn marshall would either
larkins or marshall have any motive

in placing a shell on the chair no
during the space that the four steamer
chairs were vacated was there a suffi-
cient time for any unknown person or
persons to have laid this object there
now fellows i cant answer that
who can

  i confess that larkins absurb ques-
tioning and answering himself made
me smile and i could detect despite
the seriousness of the moment a twin-
kle in the eye of courtlandt neither
of us answered the reporters last ques-
tion-but elizabeth did 

  shortly after you left with mr
marshall van and i walked the deck
for some ten minutes going to the port
side but not very far toward the stern
we stood at the rail some time a
good many of the different passengers
passed mr marshall returned some
minutes ago and while we did not
occupy the chairs i am sure the car-
tridge or shell or whatever it is was
not there did rou see it when you
returned mr marshall 

  i did not i answered the first
i knew of its presence was when lar-
kins here drew my attention to it i
saw it then before he laid a hand  it
i dozed off in my chair so it would
have been an easy matter for some one
to have dropped it without my noticing
it

  larkins nodded pulling at his lower
lip with a nervous hand there isnt
a mark of identification on the blamed
thing he finally said producing the
shell from his pocket i made one
good guess just the same-its a six-
teen-gauge and that means that the gun
is a light one

  for some time we discussed the
strange appearance of the empty shell
but arrived at nothing definite lar-
kins and courtlandt left us to go to
the captains quarters and tell him of
the latest development in the mystery
of the phantom shotgun courtlandt
had insisted on going also-to as he
expressed it face the music in per-
son

  when the two had moved off eliza-
beth turned to me

  it was good of you to want to shield
thb phantom shotgun

mr courtlandt friend she said and
i want to thank you so very very
much

 i did nothing i answered
brusquely

  mr larkins told me you threat-
ened to shoulder the responsibility of
owning the shell-you are more than
good

  i lifted my hand and shook my head
as i smiled at her your thanks would
repay me for anything i said in a
low voice and then we two fell silent
and so remained until larkins once
more joined us

  the captain took our latest discov-
ery with unusual calm he said light-
ing a cigarette and inhaling a few
mouthfuls something else is on the
old boys mind

 did van- commenced eliza-
beth

  yep-back to the deep dungeon
the reporter said lightly rising to his
feet suddenly come on marshall i
want to show you something funny
youll excuse us wont you

  elizabeth nodded-a bit wistfully i
thought

  leaving her in our little nook on the
saloon deck larkins led the wray above
our walk bringing us past the wireless
room where the machine inside was
tearing and roaring and crashing with-
out cessation

  hold up a minute said the re-
porter stopping short does it not
strike you that sparks is extremely
fond of this hot weather and he
referred to the fact that the little state-
room door was closed this undoubt-
edly did look que r

  he seems to be sending the same
kind of sounds i observed as lar-
kins stepped up close to the door

  the reporter frowned as he lis-
tened

  say marshall dont jump over-
board or anything like that but the
operator in there is sending s o s
said the newspaper man quietly

   s o s   i repeated not under-
standing

  youve heard of c q d lar-
kins asked

  of course jack binns made that
famous i returned but i dont see
the connection

  the connection is this said lar-
kins  c q d is not used any more
s o s has taken its place in other
words this vessel is calling through
the wireless that she is in distress and is
in need of assistance

chapter xvi

the fire below decks

  i grasped larkins arm in alarm is
the ship sinking i cried

 hush he commanded do you
want to start a panic he stepped
up to the door of the wireless room
and listened again

  what is he sending now i asked
for even my inexperienced ears could
detect a difference in the crashings
the whole forward part of the ship
hummed with the sound of the key and
over the transom the flickering blue-
green light played weirdly

  b h s mused larkins aloud i
wonder what that can mean  he evi-
dently is trying to get some station on
land but i doubt if his aerials are high
enough to carry that far i followed
him out on deck and without a word
he went to the lower deck and aft

  do you notice how much warmer it
is here than forward he asked me
suddenly i had noticed it

well marshall this ship is on fire

  i stared at him bewildered but i
dont see any smoke i said

  not if the captain can help it you
wont said larkins sniffing the air
where we stood the cargo under this
aft hatch is afire notice how it is
battened down if you listen you will
hear the pumps working

  you mean that right here beneath
us--

  s-h-h-h-h here comes the cap-
tain warned larkins

  captain loyd made his way briskly
along the deck i now saw how really
haggard he appeared and he hardly no-
ticed us as he leaned on the rail that


the popular magazine

overlooked the deck where the hatches
wepe located

  do you think you will get it under
control all right asked larkins

  captain loyd whirled around and
stared at the reporter in amazement
what did you say he askedgruffly

  i merely asked if you thought you
could get the fire under control before
we hit port or will we have to look
to some vessel to come to our assist-
ance

  young man what are you talking
about the captain tried to put the
question blandly but it was plain to
both of us that he was greatly dis-
turbed

  there there larkins smiled
youre a good skipper but youre a
darned poor liar i think marshall and
i are the only ones outside of the crew
who know what is threatening us and
count on the fact that we know how to
keep our mouths shut

  thank you my boy said the cap-
tain wearily i feel that if word of
this latest catastrophe got abroad the
ship after the nerve-racking experi-
ences the passengers have endured
through our shotgun mystery theres
no saying what might happen i want
to feel that i can count implicitly on
your and mr marshalls discretion

  sure thing returned larkins hear-
tily i gathered from my smattering
of morse that the minerva is signal-
ing for help from the bacchus which
passes us some time to-day

  yes i hope to keep the fire under
control until we raise the bacchus who
should answer our call of distress soon
and i am keeping a little to the south
so as to be on her course wtith both
vessels going at full speed we ought
to sight each other late this afternoon
god grant she may reach us before
news of this hideous misfortune be-
comes known among the already un-
nerved passengers his voice was
tired and broken and he seemed to
have aged a dozen years since the day
we had steamed past sandy hook

  but captain loyds hope of secrecy
in regard to the discovery of the fire

was destined to go unrealized lar-
kins and i had gone down to luncheon
together i being far too disquieted and
agitated to do other than merely make
a pass at eating but larkins as usual
tackling the whole menu from soup to
a series of desserts with the same un-
diminished enthusiasm

  i believe you could eat if you were
being hanged i growled savagely ir-
ritated beyond endurance at his non-
chlnncc

  id be hanged if i couldnt he re-
turned pleasantly and examined his
second piece of pie critically as if to
be sure it was altogethdfr to his liking

  just as we were ascending the broad
stairway on our return to the deck a
sudden explosion rent the air the ship
rocked crazily a dense pall of smoke
enveloped the decks and companion-
ways and above the terrified screams
of the passengers rang the nerve-rack-
ing cry of 
fire

  larkins swept the deck like a young
hurricane plunging through a knot of
hysterical passengers reached van
courtlandts stateroom and yelled to
him to break his arrest and take care
of mrs forbes i followed as best i
could with my misshapen foot feeling
my way through the dense smoke with
the aid of my cane i came upon lar-
kins again where the crew was gath-
ered fighting with puny streams of wa-
ter the hell that belched from the aft
hatchway

  captain loyd was directing the fire
fighting his white uniform torn and
bespattered while woodruff stripped
to the waist stood -se to the edge of
the hatch doing three mens work the
crew some of them barricaded behind
coils of rope boxes tarpaulins or any-
thing that offered shelter from the in-
tolerable heat fought as men fight for
their lives the sight was inspiring yet
terrible indeed

  the tropical sun beat down on the
ship in a fury and the sdlid tongue of
yellow red that leaped up from the
bowels of the ship presented the
brocken of a mephistos dream all
about the after part of the ship the
the phantom shotgun



white paint was shriveled and scorched
from the intense heat and as a white-
jacketed steward ran past us larkins
and i followed in his wake to hear
what he had to report to the captain
who was directing from the aft portion
of the saloon deck

  the wireless operator sir yelled
the steward says as ow es been talk-
in with the bacchus sir she will
overaul us by nine or ten oclock sir
a look of relief crossed the captains
soot-stained face and a prayer of in-
finite thanksgiving stirred in my own
heart larkins said thats good as
casually as if he were commenting on
the qualities of his favorite dessert

  as the steward passed us again lar-
kins stopped him

  i see the engine-room crew is stick-
ing said the reporter

  yes sir but the rotters will be a-
comin out mark me returned the
man gloomily

  this was the first intimation i had
that any trouble with that part of the
crew might come about steadily the
propeller shafts kept up their pound-
ing and as majestic as ever the ship
cut through the waters the only un-
toward sound was the awful roar of
the devouring flames

  the reporter and i using the side of
the deck house as a shield watched the
seemingly hopeless fight the puny
streams of water that poured into the
hatch were almost instantly converted
into steam that mingled with the black
smoke before the water could quench
the devastating fire catching wood-
ruffs eye the captain signaled to the
first officer to come up on deck

  how are things coming the cap-
tain shouted

  not-quite-holding-own yelled
back the panting woodruff twenty
lines hose playing into hold water
cant get down where trouble lies hold
too closely packed

  how is engine room

  woodruff shook his head gravely
dont know he- shouted then the
captain and the first officer moved for-
ward to where the air was less smoky

and the roar of the flames a little less
thunderous and woodruff went on
the place is steadily growing hot-
ter as the fire is nearing the iron-plate
partition mcdonald sent up word that
he is reduced to bulldozing the stokers
to keep them at the work but they

- he stopped suddenly and threw

back his shoulders taking long deep
breaths

  captain loyds face grew tense and
his jaws locked with sudden grim de-
termination when he spoke it was
more to the blue of the heavens than
to woodruff if we have to abandon
the engine room we will be without
power to run the ship to land and beach
her or to keep the deck streams go-
ing

  the first officer nodded mcdon-
ald will have to stick

  get word to him that this ship
must be kept moving shouted the
skipper tell him to brain the first
man who starts up the ladders he
has got to stay there until every last
man jack of them drops the boat has
got to get to land

  woodruff turned and vaulted to the
deck below shouting words of encour-
agement to the crouching forms of the
crew as they clung to the hot nozzles
of the hose lines

  for an hour larkins and i watched
the unequal fight luckily the blaze
confined itself to the inside of the
hatch but every now and then a stream
of wrater would be sent sweeping over
the deck superstructure to obviate the
danger of its bursting into flame from
the awful heat radiated from the
hatch

  suddenly a great yell from woodruff
rang above the throbbing of the pumps
and the roar of the flames and larkins
ran to the rail

  its all over i cried they are
deserting the engine room

  the reporter followed the captain as
he scrambled to the lower deck for up
from the companionway that connected
the engine room with the deck poured
a horde of grimy cubans rushing over
woodruff who tried to send them back
with his fists

chapter xvii

the phantom shotgun speaks again

  this is a portion of larkins story
as published in his paper

  the minerva was about one hundred and
fifty miles from the florida coast when the
flames attacked the iron partition that di-
vided the engine room from the after hold
where the fire raged chief engineer
mcdonald hard-headed and hard-fisted
scotchman that he was had his hands full
keeping the below-deck crew at their sta-
tions the heat of the engine room was al-
most intolerable smoke gathered there in
great choking clouds and the cubans who
in the main composed the boiler crew went
about their work muttering ominously

  captain loyd knew the safety of the ship
and the lives intrusted to his care hung
contingent on keeping the mighty engines
going his orders to mcdonald were to
keep the propellers whirling the ship to
the safety of the shoals fiercer and fiercer
the fire glowed and in the depths of the
ship it seemed that human beings could not
live mcdonald sent a message to the cap-
tain that at any moment the men would
either have to abandon the place or be
roasted alive

  roast was captain loyds answer

  coughing and sputtering in the deadly
smoke that gripped their lungs like the
handshake of a giant mcdonald and a few
of his- assistants kept the oilers wipers en-
gineers and stokers at their tasks word
coming to the commander that the men in
the engine room were dropping like flies
from the heat and smoke his face whitened
as he ordered those who had succumbed
brought to the deck for a few lungfuls of
fresh air then to be sent back as soon as
revived

  the crisis was imminent when the cap-
tain suggested the experiment of turning the
steam on the stifling interior and this in a
measure converted the smoke and the air
cleared a little

  slowly but surely the flames ate their
way to the iron-plate partitions and the
wall dividing the engine room from the
after hold grew red-hot

  at this sign the cubans shrieking and
cursing rushed for the ladders leading to
the deck mcdonald and his few faithful
adherents going down beneath the wrenches
and shovels wielded by the deserters

  first officer woodruff flung the first men
scrambling to safety back on those following
but he might as well have tried to stem the
eruption of vesuvius a shovel felled him
to the iron deck and the mutineers faced
the rain from captain loyds revolver a
passenger standing by the side of the com-
mander brought an automatic pistol into
play and the deserters were driven to the
starboard side of the deck

   one of them bolder than the rest sprang
 to the davits that held a boat on this side
 and was throwing off the wrappings as the
 rest of his fellows crowded around him in
 a fury captain loyd flung his empty re-
 volver at them and was rushing the cubans
 empty-handed when from the companion-
 way that led from the staterooms on the
 saloon deck a flash of fire shot forth a loud
 report vibrated over the gulf and five of
 the stokers fell-one of them headlong into
 the sea

  a yell went up from the mutineers-a
cry charged with the hysteria of supersti-
tion and they fell to their knees and on
their faces crossing themselves and grovel-
ing in the dirty water that covered the deck

  the phantom shotgun had spoken again

   it was with a feeling of relief that the
 captain beheld the change the shot had
 wrought and he swiftly seized the oppor-
  tunity to play on their fear of the super-
 natural

  the god of death has spoken he cried
 dramatically now back to your duties be-
 fore all of you die by his instrument 

  woodruff at this moment hurried up the
 blood pouring from a deep gash on his fore-
 head and led them cringing back to the in-
 ferno below where sorely wounded they
 found the chief engineer assisted by two
 nearly dead men keeping the mighty shafts
 whirling the vessel on to florida and safety

  almost immediately in the wake of the
 shot from the companionway van buren
 courtlandt appeared on the deck and came
 rushing down the ladder to where captain
 loyd was berating the mutineers he begged
 the commander to accept his assistance in
 any way explaining that he knew enough
 about engineering to take orders from mc-
 donald

  captain loyd looked at him strangely
 you have already rendered great assist-
 ance he said with scarcely veiled mean-
 ing t will be glad to have you report to
 mr mcdonald-he will need you surely

   courtlandt stared at the captain stupidly
 for a few seconds as if to grasp the mean-
 ing of his inference then with a shrug of
 his shoulders turned and plunged into the
 passage that led to the engine room and the
 raging hell below decks

  larkins was stretched out in a
steamer chair smoking when i found
him after the facts narrated above and
shortly afterward mrs forbes joined
us with glowing eyes she listened to
larkins account as to the manner in
which courtlandt had jumped into the
midst of the fray he gave a detailed
account of everything van said and did
and also added that the captain had
thanked him for firing the shotgun with
such decided effect
the phantom shotgun



  but he didnt fire the shotgun  she
cried why van was with me on the
port side of the deck near the library
trying to forcibly prevent a distracted
mother from flinging herself overboard
with her baby at the sound of the
pistol shots he ran straight along the
deck and i could see him running when
the shotguns report rang out

  larkins looked at her speculativelj
well all i know is he didnt have the
weapon in his hand when he jumped
into the thick of the scrap he paused
for a moment i give it up he said
slowly two or three manifestations
like that and i shall throw my vote
over into the superstition column
what do you think marshall he
asked suddenly

  i used one of his favorite slangisms
in answering

  search me said i

  you ought to know he growled
querulously i left you on deck not
twenty feet away from the door that
shielded the wielder of the shotgun
you forget i returned that i
left the deck when you did i was not
there to stop any bullets and i went
forward at an rate i dont see why
we should censure the shooter in this
instance for it strikes me he did a
pretty decent service to the ship

  yes thats true enough assented
the newspaper man but just the same
id like to thank him to his face

  please lets not discuss it any more
broke in elizabeth pleadingly 

  all right we wont talk of it
agreed larkins loath to leave the sub-
ject but ill keep busy at my little
game in silence

  what little game is that  i inquired
as he moved off

  shotgun shotgun whos got the
shotgun  he flung over his shoulder

chapter xyiit

the transfer at sea

  every quarter hour the chief engi-
neer converted the stifling smoke in
the engine room by turning on the
steam thereby clearing the atmosphere
long enough for the men toiling in the
b

bowels of the ship to gulp the revived
air into their choking lungs before the
deadly smoke settled about them again
like a pall it was sickening hideous
work but the crew fought doggedly
and steadily and kept the power alive

 slowly evening drew near the
electric lights were switched on when
the sudden tropical night engulfed us
and at about nine the moon lit up the
boundless sea the after deck pre-
sented a weird sight as tongues of
flames momentarily licked into the still
air of the gulf tons of water poured
into the red-hot depths and the white
steam mingled with the black smoke
fantastically and presented such a pic-
ture of vivid and fearful magnificence
as dorc might have evolved from his
splendid imagination

  just before midnight land wras report-
ed dead ahead and with eager foot-
steps a quartermaster and two of the
crew hurried forward from a perch
on the port side the heaver of the lead
droned out that he could not get bot-
tom soon he commenced calling fath-
oms to the officers on the bridge and
a faint cheer went up from the knot of
passengers gathered on that part of
the deck

  when six fathoms were reported to
him by the quartermaster captain
loyd ordered the vessel stopped and
with a rattle the huge anchors tumbled
into the sea as the great propeller
shafts stopped the steady throbbing of
the pumps sounded above the roar and
crackle of the fire and steady streams
of water poured from the twenty noz-
zles into the broiling hold

  many passengers had quieted down
but occasionally little things set them
scurrying about like frightened quail
a report that the crew was provision-
ing the lifeboats plunged half a dozen
back into hysterics and caused a score
of men to fortify spirits with spirits

  there were a few shining examples
of real courage and heroism i must
coifess to tremors of panic seizing me
like symptoms of fever and ague but
elizabeth forbes was of finer mold
and after the first shock of fear she
was regardless of everything but thq


the popular magazine

comforting and sustaining of those
around her

  despite the fact that they had been
reassured again and again an audible
prayer of thanksgiving went up from
all on board when the steady lights of
an oncoming steamer appeared over the
western horizon

  the bacchus shouted an excited
inan bounding into the library and
every passenger rushed to the decks
hysterically overhead the crash
crash cr-r-r-r-r-etsh of the wireless
even took on a brighter more joyous
tone and every command given from
the bridge earned a cheer

  long before the bacchus came with-
in hailing distance the order that the
passengers without luggage were to be
transferred to the sister ship and there
await the result of the fight to subdue
the flames was given

  a battle of the elements i heard
larkins say softly to himself and puz-
zled as to the meaning of his remark
on such a perfect night as this i
pressed him for an explanation

  wait and see he answered as he
turned his attention to the preparation
the passengers were making for the
transfer to the succoring vessel

  when captain loyd arrived on deck
the reporter drew him aside and held
a whispered conversation with him and
after a few sentences the commander
moved away saying he would have
some of the crew keep watch

  may i ask who or what is to be
watched i asked the newspaper man
as he joined me at the rail

  sure he responded but keep it
under your belt-every passenger and
every effect that is taken from this boat
will be most thoroughly scrutinized for

any evidence of-

  the phantom shotgun  i put in
larkins nodded if friend shotgun
bobs up on the bacchus after this he
added i will indeed begin to believe
in fairies

  he tool up an advantageous position
at the head ofthe ships ladder where
woodruff directed the disembarking of
the passengers the sea was as smooth
as a mirror and the moon was shining

brilliantly as the crew lowered the boats
from the davits while from the huge
sister ship the small boats were already
under way to assist in the transfer

  with the arrival of the bacchus the
spirits of the passengers revived won-
derfully and when the transfer from
ship to ship was started they were in
excellent humor the men and women
laughed and called little pleasantries to
each other as they went down the ships
side to where the boats rode lightly on
the water a short hundred yards away
lay the bacchus and the small boats
covered the distance quickly leaving
the tale of their passage in a swift
sparkling streak of phosphorescent
foam

  woodruff the chief steward the
purser and larkins closely- inspected
every passenger that left the ship very
little was allowed to be taken in the
way of personal effccts and as lar-
kins expressed it under their combined
scrutiny it would be difficult for any
one to safely conceal a toothpick much
less a shotgun

  i was in the boat that carried eliza-
beth-courtlandt and larkins coming
over to the bacchus with the last load
of passengers	

  what about the battle of the ele-
ments you foretold  i asked the re-
porter as soon as he gained the deck
and the four of us leaned over the rail
looking at the smoking ship we had
just deserted-the ship that had been
the setting for so many puzzling and
baffling mysteries

  theres your answer cried lar-
kins and as we looked we beheld the
stern of the minerva slowly sinking
into the sea

  a gasp of astonishment went up
from all on board the bacchus as the
ship that had carried us from new
york continued to settle until the entire
stern was submerged the three of us
turned to larkins plying him with
questions

  its just a little scrap to the finish
between fire and water as it became
evident to captain loyd that the fire
could not be absolutely extinguished
without completely soaking the cargo
thb phantom shotgun



compartments where the conflagration
raged he has had the sea gates opened
when the compartments where the
blaze has been confined have had a few
hours soaking the gates will be closed
again and the compartments pumped
out thats all

  do you think the fire has finished
the shotgun or will the water attend to
that asked courtlandt of the re-
porter

  search me  replied larkins if
that blamed gun shows up again i shall
certainly feel like the fellow that saw
a giraffe for the first time and ex-
claimed  aw there aint no such
thing 

  why mr bobby larkins chided
elizabeth rather indignantly do you
mean to try and tell me that you-you
are beginning to credit this absurd the-
ory of a supernatural agency

  well figure the whole business for
yourself he responded wearily not
a passenger or member of the crew left
the minerva with anything faintly re-
sembling a shotgun a shotgun is
slightly bigger than a mustache comb
too

  then thank goodness the terrible
thing is not aboard this ship i ex-
claimed  and both elizabeth and court-
landt echoed my words

  dont be too sure little ones lar-
kins rejoined did you ever have a
hunch he paused and surveyed us
gravely well ive got a big healthy
one and its that the phantom shot-
gun is aboard the bacchus this very
minute

  we laughed the last thing i heard
you say before we left the minerva
i reminded him was that no soul
should leave that ship with a toothpick
on his person unbeknownst to you

  yes thats so he admitted but a
hunch is a hunch for all that

  staterooms were assigned to all the
passengers from the minerva and al-
most every one sought bunks without
delay worn out after the long siege of
wakefulness and excitement

  a roaring crash awakened everybody
about four a m and i joined the

crowd of half-dressed passengers who
rushed out on deck a number were
gathered around a prostrate form on
the after deck and as i approached i
heard a sailors voice cry out

  a man has been shot sir his
names larkins i understand

chapter xix

the siiootixg of larkins

  before noon we had all been re-
transfered back to the minerva the
stern of the vessel had been submerged
in thirty-five feet of water the ocean
completely soaking the burning cargo
and then with the compartments
pumped out the ill-fated boat was
again in trim for the continuation of
her voyage to new orleans

  larkins was not killed but near it
he was no quitter however pie
threatened to swim from the bacchus
when it was suggested that he be taken
back to new york on that steamer
rather than risk the chance of further
or greater injury should he return to
the minerva

  according to the reporter his
wounds were trivial but when a man
has a number of leaden pellets in his
body-granted they did not stray into
fatal spots-he is not all he should be
so larkins was tenderly ferried from
the bacchus to the minerva where he
was put to bed in one of the best state-
rooms

  propped up in this bed larkins re-
ceived woodruff courtlandt the cap-
tain and myself

  welcome to our city greeted the
reporter gayly glad to see you cap-
tain  i wish vou would direct my
nurse-here he patted elizabeths
hand-to furnish me with an unlim-
ited supply of cigarettes im famished
for a smoke

  i dont like cigarettes said eliza-
beth with decision

  quite proper rejoined larkins
but i do besides smoking cigarettes
doesnt hurt a man

  i never saw a man smoke one
flashed elizabeth


the popular magazine

  larkins dodged and threw up his
hands taking advantage of a dying
martyr he groaned if i hadnt had
my brains investigated by a lead muck-
raker you couldnt get away with it
yes but lets talk of other death-
dealing implements besides cigarettes
i broke in larkins we came here
to-

  find out how i got mine supplied
the reporter well there isnt much
to tell	

  i had just finished a wireless dis-
patch to the ledger telling of the
events of the day and night that had
passed and was out on deck taking
an early-morning view of the minerva
as she lay in the water- looking for all
the world like a wounded duck i heard
no sound as i stood there except the
continual lapping of the water against
the boats hull

  without the least warning a roar
seemed to shatter my eardrums and i
was aware of a sharp stab such as i
imagine a lightning bolt might give and

- he paused in his recital and

closed his eyes for a brief second
well thats all there was to it there
i was andhere i am

  captain loyd was the first to speak
after larkins had finished his story

 what puzzles me is-

  the spook shotgun furnished lar-
kins for him

  the mystery had indeed grown
the shotgun that mysterious imple-
ment of death was still the great un-
solved problem

  i got a mighty surprise when word
reached me that you had been laid low
by that-that thing the captains
voice actually faltered as he endeavored
to name the mysterious weapon

  yes the old mystery has certainly
chirked up some agreed larkins
cheerfully i watched every boatload
that left the minerva and i didnt see
anything that looked like a shotgun go-
ing along

  the captain nodded and ill stake
my life that the thing didnt come
aboard this noon i had every passen-
ger searched when they returned from
the bacchus

  cap-larkins voice was a trifle
raspy-ill bet you a dollar to a
doughnut that youre a dead one
bless my soul what do you
mean the captain queried anxiously
every wrinkle in his ruddy countenance
forming into minute interrogation
points

  just this-friend shotgun like the
old black cat came back and is now
aboard this ship

  is that mere guesswork or have you
found out something asked court-
landt who up to this time had said
nothing his voice was a little anxious
i thought and at the time i wondered
why

  figure it out for yourself the re-
porter parried hey how is it you
arent in the brig being fed on bread
and water you dont mean to tell
me that they havent accused you of
shooting me

  there was a pause and then court-
landt laughing shortly spoke up
they have bobby some one de-
clared that after you were shot they
saw me near the after deck flitting
away like a frightened sparrow-or
something like that

  ah-ha-another reporter aboard
larkins grinned he looked like a fiend
with his grin connecting the swaths of
lint bound around his head well
van you certainly are a jo dont
fret-you didnt shoot me

 wtho did asked the captain
quickly

  the shark i guess returned the
reporter winking at the rest of us
hes the only one with a guilty enough
conscience to have run away despite
his flippant words i realized with a
start that larkins was holding some-
thing back

  then elizabeth took a hand and de-
claring that her patient needed quiet
and rest she drove the three of us out
of the stateroom paying no heed to
the frantic protestations of the injured
man

  the captain and i walked leisurely
along the deck steadily the minerva
pounded forward on the bosom of the
gulf ahead to the northwest lay the
the phantom shotgun



mouth of the mississippi and the end
of our voyage on this point i ques-
tioned captain loyd

  we should fetch port eads about
midnight and will tie up before ten
oclock tuesday he said and
thank god for it he added in an
undertone

  same here captain i said it has
been a trying trip indeed i for one
must congratulate you on the manner
in which you have handled the ship and
the untoward happenings

  he thanked me warmly i dont
know what i would have done without
that young newspaper chap he added
he is a bright clever fellow and if
his accident had proved fatal i would
have really felt it a personal loss
hes a first-rate fellow i agreed
heartily but did it ever strike you
captain that that youngster knows
more about all this mystery than he
has told us

  indeed no the ships master has-
tened to assure me i believe mr
larkins has been perfectly frank and
open in everything he has done and
said

  it is not that captain i returned
it is what he has not said-unless of
course he has privately confided to you
all he has learned toward clearing up
this mystery of the murders and the
elusive shotgun

  no you have heard everything he
has said to me the captain replied
what has prompted you to think
otherwise pie put the question
bluntly 

  i dont know i said i somehow
get the vague impression that he al-
ways knows a little more than he tells
by the way did you know that when
captain peterson of the bacchus or-
dered an investigation of his ship im-
mediately after the finding of larkins
wounded body some one-who it was
i was unable to discover-started the
rumor that larkins had turned the
spectral weapon on himself so as to
end the whole affair in a blaze of
glory 

  how ridiculous snorted the cap-
tain what will they be saying next

  but this evidently set him thinking
because he paced the deck with head
bowed uttering no sound suddenly
he turned to me in a hesitating man-
ner

  mr marshall will you come with
me while i question larkins on a few
points he asked

  i acquiesced and together the cap-
tain and i went to the - room where
larkins was abed elizabeth forbes
was reading to him and as we entered
she laid the book on the bed with the
pages open the gaudy cover and gar-
ish title bore lurid testimony to the fact
that it was a detective mystery story
i tapped the book with my cane

  brushing up on theory and detail
or seeking a solution of our incompar-
able mystery  i asked laughing

  just following my natural bent he
retorted besides i like the dulcet
tones of my nurses voice he peered
at the captain through his glasses
whats up he demanded

  the captain seemed at a loss how
to proceed with what he had to say
he drew his hand across his mouth
several times and cleared his throat
nervously

  speak up little one-be not afraid
laughed larkins

  mr larkins began the captain i
believe you once told me that when you
investigated anything you suspected
everybody didnt you

  yep-the whole shooting match-
from doorknobs to the family cat

 then you will-ah-er-

  not be offended if you ask me some
direct questions as to whether or not i
am the phantom behind the shotgun
larkins supplied

  oh captain elizabeth cried
every bit of color had gone from her
face as she turned to the commander
and her eyes were indignant

 why are you on board the mi-
nerva captain loyd stood nearer the
reporter as he put the question did
your paper send you on this trip to
cover-as you call it--the honeymoon
of-- he left the sentence unfin-
ished waving his hand vaguely

  no captain it did not replied lar-


thb popular magazine

kins with a sparkle in the gray eyes
even on yellow journals we have
what is known as vacations im hav-
ing mine

  why on this boat a
hope you people wont laugh said
larkins with a sheepish little grin
but some years ago i was a reporter
on a new orleans paper and i aspired
to be the star man the boss decreed
otherwise so i abandoned the paper to
its fate a few months ago i read that
this same paper had doubled its circu-
lation and it rather spoiled my appetite
for a week still a little skeptical i
started for the land of magnolias
creole beauties ramos gin fizzes and
the statue of general jackson to see
if it really flourisheth as its circulation
manager sweareth as luck would
have it this mystery broke right under
my nose-and there you are

  he eyed us blandly as he finished
and as if there was nothing more to
be said

  did you shoot yourself asked the
captain bluntly

  i should say not retorted the re-
porter emphatically i have too much
regard for the tender feelings of one
robert l larkins

  did you shoot forbes

  not that i can recall

  hallaron

  not guilty

  did you fire the shot that brought
the stokers to their senses continued
the captain colorlessly

  you ought to be able to guess the
answer to that captain larkins re-
plied pleasantly if i remember right-
ly i was soaking cubans in the eye
-one in particular who was trying to
find the space between your fourth and
fifth rib with a long knife that all
took place on deck in your plain sight
of course as a newspaper man i
would do a whole lot for my sheet but
we reporters always draw the line at
murder

  a general laugh went up which
brought the farce of cross-questioning
larkins to an end

  the murderer is on this boat and

we will have to find him her or it be
fore the minerva lands or the authori-
ties never will after the passenger list
scatters to the four parts of the world
the captain sighed as he realized the
task before him

  dont waste time looking for the
murderer captain loyd said the re-
porter

  why do you advise that i put in
do you think it is useless

  i think it a waste of energy in
this problem the shotgun is x that
is the way i am figuring get that
wraith of a weapon learn how if you
can it could be carried to the bacchus
without it being seen by us who
watched suppose you wanted a weap-
on of that kind how would you manu-
facture one  put yourself in the mur-
derers place and go over the events
of the past few days and dope it out
the way you would do such a thing if it
were up to you to do thats the way
to do it as old boy punch says

  b-r-r-r-r i shook my shoulders
excuse me from such gruesome men-
tal calculations im afraid im not
cold-blooded enough for that lar-
kins

  the captain said he certainly agreed
with me and he left for his post i
followed shortly after to partake of a
solitary dinner and spend the rest of
the evening parading the deck with my
thoughts as the ship drew nearer and
nearer the crescent city the night on
the gulf was beautiful as soon as the
moon came up and many were loath
to turn in until long after the deck
lights were extinguished

  when i went to bed i left my deck
window wide open for the heat of the
tropics made sleep a doubtful issue and
i lay awake for hours unable to sink
into the blessed oblivion

  it was while i was wide awake that
the phantom shotgun spoke again fill-
ing my little cabin with a sheet of wick-
ed flame a deafening roar and the
stinging fumes of burned powder

  i was trembling and unnerved when
i flung open my door to the furious
pounding of those who quickly crowd-
ed the social hall
the phantom shotgun



chapter xx

the lincoln pennv

  are you hurt shouted larkins
who came limping into the narrow
qtiarters closely followed by court-
landt woodruff and half a dozen ex-
cited others

  i dont know i answered sinking
back in my bunk and burying my head
in my hands am i

  you ought to know snapped the
reporter as he switched on the electric

bulb it doesnt look it- gee

whiskers he added and i turned to
see what he pointed to the wooden
back of my bunk was riddled with
shot

  questions poured in on me and i an-
swered them as best i could

were you asleep  larkins asked

  i hacf explained that the heat had
made it impossible

  hurrah you saw him then

  i shook my head i was lying with
my eyes shut the first thing i knew
was the awful roar and as i scrambled
to my feet the powder smoke choked
me

  larkins limped over to the window
it was fired from the deck see the
bullet marks show that it came from
this direction any one on deck he
yelled poking his head through the
window a hasty glance up and down
the boards seemed to satisfy him for
he withdrew his head almost instantly

  nothing doing he muttered then
he faced us captain this is getting
to be serious this in a louder tone
as the commander entered hurriedly
marshall here has had a narrow es-
cape from friend shotgun

  i had to tell my story all over again
for the perplexed captain and at the
end of an hours consultation wood-
ruff again went through the ship mak-
ing futile search for the implement of
death

  once more were the passengers of
the minerva thrown in a panic the
attempt on my life combined with the
torpidity of the night banished all de-
sire for further sleep along near
dawn in answer to a knocking at my

  door i opened it to find larkins pale
and haggard standing in the hallway

  just a question marshall he said
were you in the lower berth where
the shot holes are when the shot was
fired

  just as i told you before i an-
swered tartly for i was beginning to
tire of the unceasing fusillade of ques-
tions why do you ask

  im trying to dope this thing out
as long as  cant sleep he said in
a weary voice leaning against the door
jamb

  dont try old man i said spring-
ing to his side and throwing a sup-
porting arm about his shoulders you
are sick-wounded-larkins and you
are killing yourself by the misuse of
the energy that you have left chuck
it-forget it larkins please

  marshall id never hold up my
head again if i let this ship get to new
orleans and i not solve this busi-
ness in spite of himself his head
lopped forward on his chest and i
dragged him inside and dosed him with
a stiff shot of whisky

  you go to sleep my boy i said
the drink revived him and as he sat
on the edge of my bunk his dressing
robe wrapped about his long legs he
presented a pathetic figure he was
absently fingering one or two of the
shot holes when i asked him to have
another drink from my flask

  it will make you i urged

  that stuff doesnt make reporters-
it unmakes them he said dryly i
dont think id like to be sleeping in
this bunk and have any one take a pot
shot at me then he got up and went
to the door all his weakness gone

  take some of this stuff with you
i asked

  no-o-o he said queerly you
have given me enough i am going to
go to sleep now

  glad to hear it old boy-you need
it i called to him as he made his wray
across the social hall pie seemed to
walk quite spry too

most of the passengers were on deck
when port eads was reached and lar-
kins propped up on a steamer chair


the popular magazine

hailed with delight the small army of
reporters and camera men from the dif-
ferent new orleans papers wtho came
aboard off pilot town these good-
natured and impertinent young fellows
questioned everybody  board indis-
criminately and larkins was enjoying
the novelty of being interviewed for the
first time in his life-just like a real
person as he put it it was a sight to
see the reporters clustered about him
listening to his fantastic recital of the
mystery that was engaging the attention
of the whole country

  as he talked larkins wrote rapidly
on the pad that lay in his lap and per-
formed the feat of talking about one
thing and writing about another at the
some time to the curious he said
that he was getting his copy off to his
distant paper

  after we had passed quarantine we
went down for the last breakfast on
board and larkins in high spirits de-
spite his wounds kept the captains ta-
ble and those near by convulsed with
laughter throughout the meal

  i want to know the meaning of all
this hilarity - elizabeth demanded
for a wounded hero you are not con-
ducting yourself with becoming sobri-
ety

  the presence of so charming a
nurse has intoxicated me larkins
laughed exultantly that and the fact
that i have solved the mystery of the
phantom shotgun

  a surprised hush fell over the big
dining saloon as the reporter made his
startling announcement which was
swiftly passed from mouth to mouth
one or two stewards dropped their
trays and the clatter of broken china
mingled with the sudden storm of ques-
tions that poured upon him from all
sides

  oh im not dead sure he shouted
above the clamor but i rather guess
ive worked it out when i rend the
veil of mystery we shall find the phan-
tom shotgun in-stateroom a

  other than this he would not say
merely going up to the wireless room
where sparks was sending the crashing
of his instruments throughout the

  ships length and breadth when the
news of larkins announcement
reached the deck where the local re-
porters were gathered they swooped
on him like a flock of hungry vultures
but he refused to say a word declar-
ing that at eight oclock in the presence
of a number of witnesses in stateroom
a the mystery would be satisfactorily
cleared

  and say you fellows he said to
his brother scribes i dont want you
to use the wireless-you boys can wait
a couple of hours until we land and
you associated press you give the
others first chance or you wont get in
on the pie at all

  i suppose you want to use the wire-
less after youve shown the thing up
said the index man

  dont worry emile laughed lar-
kins my story is going oft now-
after a while is too late for me

  i suppose it was because larkins
was himself a scribe that he could han-
dle the newspaper men the way he did
for despite their first objections they
finally agreed to follow orders

  i	after an effort managed to get
larkins alone but though i tried to
wheedle the solution from him i might
as well have attempted to coax the mys-
tery of the ages from the sphinx he
merely winked at me

  at the specified hour larkins after
speaking to the captain asked wood-
ruff to summon courtlandt the purser
the chief steward the engineer my-
self the different newspaper men and
mrs forbes the captain rounded out
the number larkins chose to witness
the dramatic disclosure we all looked
forward to as we filed into stateroom
a

  larkins wtas the last to enter and he
closed the door putting his hand into
a pocket he drew forth a coin

  in this lies the solution he said
impressively  and i believe for a few
moments everybody thought he had
gone out of his head

  ill show it to marshall first and
explain afterward as he held the
coin toward me it slipped from his
fingers and spun under the bed the
thb phantom shotgun



reporter was on his knees in an instant
reaching for it

  lend me your cane marshall so i
can hook it out and before i could
give it to him he impatiently seized the
stick and began rummaging under the
bed finally recovering the coin and
passing it to me

  i examined it eagerly why its
a lincoln penny i exclaimed at once
perplexed and relieved

  larkins nodded thats the solu-
tion he said

  what has a lincoln penny to do
with the phantom shotgun or the mys-
teriousmurders i asked

  wasnt it lincoln who said you
can fool some of the people all of the
time all of the people some of the time
but you cant fool all of the people all
of the time

  i dont see- i began

  well i do he fairly shouted at
me a rapid movement of his hands
broke the breech of my shotgun cane
and as he started to extract the car-
tridge i sprang at him savagely

  swiftly he raised the cane and
brought it down on my head

  then darkness took me in her arms
and mothered me

      chapter xxl -

which explains everything

  have we two souls is the spirit
self a tangible thing merely a few
ounces of water and albumen or is
there an actual soul with twin ruling
powers hidden from the anatomist
baffling the scalpel and microscope
each of us has a soul and many of us
are restless in the consciousness of a
second self or personality that lies la-
tent dormant a while and then asserts
itself in horrible form the body is a
ship that the soul directs yet with eyes
open to the consequences we sometimes
permit this second soul to guide us on
the rocks and reefs to wreck and dere-
liction why  the alienists do not tell
us the psychic reason is hidden deep
down in the mysteries of life

  yes i killed hamilton forbes i

killed patton or hallaron the ex-con-
vict and deck steward i also attempt-
ed the lives of courtlandt and larkins
and turned the phantom shotgun on
myself to divert suspicion which i felt
was finally centering on me  there i
made the one mistake every criminal
makes-otherwise that astute young
fellow-larkins-might never have
solved the mystery for had i been
in my bunk when the shot was fired as
i told him three of the bullets im-
bedded in the woodwork would have
had to pass through my body-and i
showed not a scratch

  sitting in the narrow confines of my
cell in the parish prison of new or-
leans i have had plenty of opportunity
to think over the events that trans-
pired on that fateful voyage of the
minerva as it all happened over a
year ago to kill time-you see i can-
not get over that habit of annihilation-
i have put the mystery of the phantom
shotgun to paper stating events ex-
actly as they occurred as a disinterest-
ed and innocent spectator might have
done allowing the reader to form his
own impressions and to draw his own
conclusions

  i offer no extenuating circumstances
in my defense for times i have sat
back and calmly endeavored to figure
out whether i am just a plain murder-
ous brute or the homicidal maniac my
lawyer is trying to prove me

  i suppose i am just a plain murderer
in every case but that of forbes i
am glad i killed him-he deserved it
as much as any venomous snake that
crawls in the grass years ago i
swore to kill him and i thank god-if
there is a god for such as i-that i
have kept that oath

  with hallaron it is different i killed
him playing safe-self-preservation is
the first law of nature and he knew
that i had shot forbes

  as for larkins he was getting too
warm as the children say when play-
ing hide and seek and i decided he
would be safer out of the way and
then again i took a peculiar pride in
powers of mystification and in a mad
moment i decided to show that the


the popular magazine

shotgun could go from one ship to the
other no matter how closely watched
but i have never been more grateful
for anything than that my aim was
aat fault even though it was through
him that i ultimately came to grief i
was justified at least in the killing of
the mutineers and that stands out as
the only praiseworthy act for which i
was responsible aboard the minerva

  the federal authorities and the two
sovereign states of new york and
louisiana are still fighting their legal
battles over my unworthy self and
louisiana will probably get me to mete
out its own peculiar form of justice
a spectacle of the noose winning over
the chair my choice would merely be
a flip of the coin--a lincoln penny
perhaps

  as you may have guessed hamil-
ton forbes-whose real name was not
forbes-and i were far from stran-
gers true he did not recognize me
aboard the mincrza but then fifteen
years since our last meeting and a
beard to say nothing of a faked club-
foot effectually disguised me as far as
he wras concerned

  forbes wrecked the innocence of my
only and well-loved sister who died
giving birth to his still-born child i
swore at the time i would kill him in
his happiest hour my bitter deter-
mination was long in reaching fruition
for forbes vanished suddenly and inex-
plicably and was lost to my knowl-
edge

  my lust for vengeance smoldered
but never went out when the news-
papers of the country exploited the
coming marriage of the wall street
millionaire and his beautiful stenog-
rapher the stories were profusely il-
lustrated in spite of the years that
had passed since i saw forbes i knew
i had my man and the desire to avenge
sprang into sudden flame

  my plan was to kill and get away
i valued my life and dared not risk a
trial by chance as i was passing
through new orleans on my way to
new york in an old rue royal antique
shop i picked up the phantom shot-
gun it was a curious weapon-to all

outward appearances merely a stout
walking stick but containing all the
devilish mechanism of a remington
i had heard of sword canes but the
shotgun cane was new to me and i
realized i had the very thing for my
contemplated purpose

  i planned the whole affair with
minute and cold-blooded exactitude
shotgun shells found in my possession
would incriminate me a safe hiding
place was imperative seeing a crip-
ple with his elevated shoe sole gave me
an idea my munitions of war in my
sole defied the close search of the first
officer and his men

  the cipher warning was one my sis-
ter and forbes had used and i was
the only oilier who knew the key
when he saw it he knew i was some-
where about ready to fulfill my vow
my method of serving it on forbes was
simple as larkins and i passed the
window of stateroom a i had  it
palmed and when i tapped the pane
calling the reporters attention to the
burning lights i dropped it within and
when we were in the room interrogat-
ing forbes with my hand behind my
back i scrawled the sign of sigma on
the wall

  the actual killing of forbes was not
difficult i slipped otit of my state-
room and fired at the sleeping man
through the narrow ventilation slit
above the door my cane was without
a stock so the depression of the muzzle
was easy and that was why it was so
difficult for larkins and the others to
figure it out i was back in my state-
room in an instant and out again only
when i appeared aroused by the re-
porter my deck window was next to
that of stateroom a so when hallaron
was directly in front of the room once
occupied by forbes i fired through my
window the attempts on courtlandt
and larkins were just as simple and it
was merely to peculiar circumstances
that others appeared in unfavorable
lights

  the deeds of my homania that i
have to comfort me-children of my
first soul-are shooting the cuban

that he is a hypochondriac has a headache every morning at eleven oclock

sun may shine or how gorgeously the flowers may bloom louis is there every
day with that eleven-oclock headache one morning a friend of his called him

the binding character of his oath

hen thomas s martin a member of the united states senate from vir-
ginia was practicing law in his home state he was noted for his ability
in cross-examining witnesses in one case he began the questioning of a mr
brown the defendant with this advice

   please remember mr brown that you must be very careful about every-
thing you say because you are testifying under oath

   mr brown being a high-strung southern gentleman was somewhat an-
noyed by what he considered to be an unnecessary reminder that he had sworn
to tell the truth at the end of his testimony he was told by martin that as
a witness he had handled his own case very well

    perhaps returned brown with a pleasant smile i might return the com-
pliment if i were not testifying under oath
the man who would play the
north wind

  by b m bower
  author of chip of the flying u lonesome land etc

      listen the nofth wind is singing-the north wind and the wolf and
      the wide unpeopled prairie andy and pink had heard the song a
      thousand times but they had never thought there was much music
      in it-till olafson joined the happy family olafson and his violin

                  a

the door opened windily and he
came in blinking at the sudden
change from darkness to yellow
lamplight big black-browed
broodingly somber with the poise of
one who has many times faced-and
swayed at will-the multitude he
bulked huge on the threshold while
the men in the hotel office stared
at him curiously in one hand he
carried a large suit case thickly sprin-
kled with labels in a strange lan-
guage many of them which betrayed
journeyings afar under his left arm
was a time-scarred violin case he did
not seem in the least embarrassed be-
fore the faces which stared instead he
stared back with a certain haughty ap-
praisement of the place and the people
before he closed the door against the
whooping wind which the dusk had
brought out of the west

  pink leisurely chalking a billiard
cue in preparation of a nice shot
which if successful should make
for the complete discomfiture of his
opponent-who was andy green-
glanced at the stranger idly smiled
across at andy and looked again more
attentively andy greens gray eyes
following pinks glance widened in
recognition of the type if not the man
himself

  by gracious pink looks like were
due to listen at some grand opera he
murmured sidling closer to the other
barring the open-front vest and swal-

lowtail coat and footlights and flowers
all over the place youve got the whole
show right there billed six weeks ahead
of himself fifty cents one dollar two
and two-and-a-half and all the boxes
taken by sassietys elected i wish
somebodyd tell me how he got to dry
lake though hes just about as ap-
propriate as a marble statue of venus
down in the blacksmith shop 

  the stranger walked over to the bar
before he spoke a word before he
had moved other than to close the door
behind him he dominated the place
when he had taken two steps forward
mikey began feverishly wiping his
hands on a corner of his barenders
apron and to experience the internal
fluttering of the housewife who sees
unexpected company at her door on
wash day

  a room if you please said the
stranger in a voice like the middle
tones of a bass viol weeth bath

  mikey felt a chill along the spine
there was not to his knowledge a room
with bath nearer than great falls
certainly none in dry lake mikey
swallowed a nervous titter rolled eyes
at his fellows for moral support and
surprised himself by weakly apologis-
ing for the deficiencies of the hotel he
represented

  i can give you a room-the best
weve got-though that aint saying
much for it either-by doubling up a
couple of the boys were pretty full
the man who woulfd play the nopth wind 

to-night im sorry we aint got any
bathroom he set his teeth defiantly
upon further abjectness and fumbled
among the keys on a rack behind him
mikey was a self-poised young man as
a rule and it was his boast that it took
a good deal to feeze him he pulled
himself back to his habitual cynical in-
difference toward the traveling public
beckoned missouk over to attend the
bar in his absence and led the way out
with his chin as high and his back as
stiff as that of his guest who stalked
after at the door there was a halt
in the measured steps of the stranger

  my luggage-you haff forgotten it
boy he reminded gently and mikey
swallowing hard went meekly back and
picked up the suit case he was a bar-
tender primarily and the guests who
lodged oftenest in that hotel were the
men of the range land all around they
waited upon themselves as a matter of
course the duties of a porter there-
fore went hard with mikey but he
did not say anything and though his
ears were strained to catch the laugh of
derision there was silence-the silence
with which men pay tribute to death
strange femininity and greatness

  dry lake with all the self-sufficiency
of little towns and little people was not
much given to paying homage to god
man or devil but whether it would
or not it paid homage to this big dark
man the homage of ill-at-ease silence
to his face and of burning curiosity
about him and all he did so soon as he
had turned his back if they had been
at all given to psychological analysis
the men of dry lake might have found
the situation even more interesting

  this strange man did nothing and
said nothing to arouse ones curiosity
he ate when the others ate silently-
with dainty habits and seeking glances
for those niceties of service which dry
lake had never possessed-and with a
manifest desire to be unassuming and
inconspicuous

  lie sat much by the window in the
barroom with his hands-wonderful
hands they were long white supple-
fingered and nervously sensitive-
drumming idly upon the whittled chair

arms and stared broodingly out upon
the bleak brown sweep of the hills to
the west the crowd was quieter when
his big black-clothed form was sitting
there there was not the slightest reason
why it should be so for he did not
seem aware of his surroundings he
never talked to any man nor did any
man attempt speech with him beyond a
tentative remark now and then upon
the weather his answer then was
courteous-so courteous as to be alarm-
ing-and brief and inattentive he
went back invariably to his brooding
and to staring at the brown hills and
the man who essayed speech with him
went sheepishly away

  in a week they learned that his name
was oiafson one hardy soul asked
him if he ever played the fiddle and
received a wince and a headshake for
reply and that was as much as dry
lake knew of him

  one day pink and weary and that
other irrepressible andy green were
loitering in the hotel dreading the long
ride to the flying u in the teeth of a
chill east wind oiafson was sitting
by the window which faced the west
and the hills by his mere presence sub-
duing somewhat the hilarious atmos-
phere which ever surrounded the boys
of the flying u when others greeted
them after an absence

  pink was sitting on the end of the
billiard table swinging his feet and
smoking while he watched andy doing
card tricks when he became aware that
a hand was laid upon his shoulder he
glanced up quickly and found himself
staring into the face of oiafson and
stare he did without in the least know-
ing wh he did so

  i should like a little conversation
weeth you if you haff the leisure and
wee be so kind said oiafson

   pink slid off the table like an obedient
child and followed the other without
a word in the armchair by the win-
dow oiafson settled himself again and
caressed abstractedly the whittled
notches on the chair arm with those
white supple fingers and gazed out at
the hills pink pulled up a chair and
sat down and waited


the popular magazine

  it iss a wild silent land said olaf-
son and turned his dark unfathomable
eyes upon fink you know it well
do you not

  yes pink answered docilely

  do you know of a place where it iss
far from other places where no person
would come often where one might
live alone and see no face and hear
no voice unless he should choose-do
you know such a place 

  pink dimpled briefly its pretty
much that way all over he said
candidly it keeps the rest of us busy
riding around the lonesomeness

  ah for the first time since he
appeared in dry lake olafson smiled
and pink sat abashed before him like
a gleam o sunlight on the storm reflec-
tions in a lake it was weel you tell
me of a place-a hut-never mind how
small and mean a hut or cabin if you
like where one might live in the midst
of the solitude alone weeth all the peo-
pled wilderness- he caught him-
self as it were from rhapsodizing and
smiled again reassuringly at pink i
am not mad young friend he said
gently i am weary weary weeth the
soul weariness which makes one sick
for the great solitudes of peoples i
am sick-sick unto death there iss a
cure its there he lifted his right
hand and with a turn of the wtrist in-
expressibly easy and graceful indicated
the hills beyond the little huddle of
houses which was dry lake weel
you help me to find that cure 

  sure said pink and for the first
time in his life perhaps was keenly
conscious of the crudity of the ex-
pression

  olafson smiled again-one could see
that there was a sweetly sunny quality
in his big rugged brooding nature a
hut far off from people he stipulated
with some eagerness lonely-oh so
very lonely and far away where no
one would come do you know a place
like that

  a dozen if you want them the
dimples stood in pinks cheeks

  but one iss sufficient the loneliest
of them all-where iss that one

  pink meditated for a moment if its

lonesomeness you want and straight-
up-and-down god-forsakenncss id
say try one-man coulee i wintered
there once so i know the shack there
is pretty fair considering nobody ever
lives in it if he can help himself and
the water is good but its away off
from the road and except when we
ride circle over there in round-up or
the outfit uses it for a line camp i
dont suppose three men a year ever see
the shack

  that iss good the fingers of
olafson beat a nervous tattoo upon the
chair i weel go to that hut and i
weel find the cure for my soul weari-
ness his rugged face lighted briefly
and settled again into the almost forbid-
ding look of gloomy introspection
there weel be matters to attend what
you call details your face i like i
do not like many-but you yes weel
you give me assistance with the de-
tails lie held up a hand and in-
spected absently his finger tips one
must eat he sighed and of the pro-
viding of food i know little

  pink sensed his utter inability to cope
with the practical side of his plan and
straightway set himself the task of at-
tending to the details andy and
weary he would have enlisted also in
the cause but weary wanted to catch
the next train for fort benton and so
excused himself andy however bent
his head over the list of supplies which
pink was painstakingly compiling and
offered now and then a suggestion of
value and otherwise olafson sat back
in his chair drummed nervously with
his fingers ard watched the two ab-
stractly with now and then a wistful
glance toward the hills for whose soli-
tudes he yearned

  say if hes got money enough to
stand the extra cost andy suggested
under his breath when the list seemed
complete we better put down more
canned stuff and not so blame much
bacon and beans he cant live on line-
camp grub pink ask him how much
he can spend on grub why dont you
pink hated to do that and fidgeted
over the list with his pencil i won-
der if he can make sour-dough bread
thb man who wouud play thb north wind 

or anything like that he whispered
anxiously if he cant hes up against
it you ask him andy

  ask him yourself  hes your orphan
not mine andy licked his pencil and
drew a heavy line through prucns 
lbs no gazabo that wears his hair
like that and a frock coat common and
that shines his finger nails every day of
his life is going to eat ten pounds of
prunes in a thousand years he chided
in pinks ear nor any gallon of
honey-dew sirup this is a dickens of
a grubstake for a man with a sick
soul

  wish i knew how much he wants to
spend pink whispered back in a har-
assed tone too worried to resent the
criticism

  well ask him why dont yuh he
dont look to me like hed bite

  so pink for once in his life showing
in his cheeks the flush of embarrass-
ment broached delicately the subject of
expense olafson brought back his
thoughts from far journeyings into the
past grasped the difficulty and unbut-
toned his black frock coat from a
leather bill folder with initials tooled
intricately upon the side he produced
a couple of bank notes laid them upon
pinks knee and looked at pink in-
quiringly

  it iss enough he queried if

hot-

  its a-plenty and then some pink
assured him folding the bills together
after he had surreptitiously shown
andy the denomination of them
two hundred for grub-we can turn
ourselves loose on the canned stuff he
whispered jubilantly

  straightway that list suffered revi-
sion as to plain necessities and reck-
less expansion as to luxuries andy
drawing upon his fertile imagination
rather freely deduced a variety of eat-
ables which seemed to him best fitted
to find their way beneath that frock
coat he leaned rather strongly toward
pickles preserves and condiments and
would have disdained such plebeian
foodstuffs as coffee bacon and flour
but pink was more practical he stuck
doggedly to the staple lines standing

pat on his twenty pounds of white
beans and ten pounds of brown with
salt pork for seasoning

  men sidled up curiously to see what
it was all about to be waved off by
those two who wrote scratched out the
writing sucked their pencils and wrote
again arguing in undertones the while
they did not believe in doing things
half-heartedly since they had taken
upon themselves the responsibility of
this strange mans physical comfort
their inclination was to discharge that
responsibility with perfect satisfaction
to themselves and if possible to olaf-
son himself

  when half a tablet had been con-
sumed and their tongues were black-
ened to their palates and their nerves
on edge with argument they took the
many-times revised list to the store and
there added and subtracted items
desperately as fresh labels on the
shelves caught their eyes it occurred
to pink that olafson would need a bed
and a few cooking utensils a stove
stood in the cabin he remembered so
they frugally curtailed the supply of
luxuries somewhat-taking off among
other things two bottles of chili sauce
one of worcester and some stuffed
olives-that they might not be com-
pelled to ask olafson for more money

  they made arrangements for a team
to haul him and his outfit to one-man
coulee bought an ax at the last min-
ute and after that a lamp and a case
of coal oil which they had overlooked
and then wondered if they had not for-
gotten matches and so got another fifty
cents worth to make sure after which
they went over to the hotel and told
olafson they had everything ready so
that he could start next morning if he
wanted to and pink with a certain
conscious pride went down into his
pockets and brought up a twenty-dollar
gold piece and some silver which he
handed over along with the store bill
of goods

  the team we didnt pay for but
dont yuh let pat morrisy stick you for
more than fifteen dollars he warned
he ought to haul you out for ten-
but he wont most likely and your


the popular magazine

bed and everything is on the bill and
well tell the old man about you using
the shack thatll be all right-he
wont care

  oiafson looked from one brown face
to the other and at the money in his
hand looked again into their eyes and
thanked them with grave words spoken
primly after the manner of one who
has learned his english from books he
did not make the blunder of offering
them money and they were more kindly
disposed toward him because of the
omission

  peoples i do not care to see he said
simply but you gentlemen weel be
always welcome come and i weel
play for you he smiled-and the
smile was infinitely tired and sad i
would not play for others and that iss
why i am here perhaps but for you i
weel play

  well sure come they promised
heartily and wished him luck and left
him wondering vaguely at his para-
doxical aloofness and reserve and his
childlike candor and helplessness

  it was because of his helplessness
that without saying much about it to
each other-and to the happy family
nothing at all-they took occasion to
ride next day to one-man coulee
they found the stovepipe pulled apart
by many battering winds and they
joined it and braced it well with wire
which they hunted a long while to find
they dragged up some posts from the
old corral and would have chopped a
pile of wood if there had been an ax
upon the place they made shift with
a stub of broom to sweep out the ac-
cumulation of dust and rats nests-and
it was when he was pushing the trash
off the doorstep that pink stopped with
a look of tragedy

  so help me josephine we never
bought ole bull a broom he cried
and stared doubtfully at the wreck of
one which he held before him

  gosh andy ejaculated in dismay
are you sure pink

  pink nodded and we never put
dowm a water bucket and dipper either

did we nor soap nor-

  we got him a dozen cans of sauer-

kraut anyway and a big hunk ofiim-
burger soothed andy nobody but
a dutchman ever says viss and he
dont look to me like hed know how
to use a broom if he had one it kinda
seems to me we did put down soap
say this sure is a lonesome hole
well thats what he wanted pink
retorted defensively he asked for
the lonesomest place i could think of-
and this is it

  a good scrubbing wouldnt hurt that
floor a blamed bit andy observed ir-
relevantly if i had a broom and a
bucket-sure you didnt order a broom
pink 

  pink was listening to the far-off ka-
chuck of a wagon bumping over the
uneven prairie sod with a rock here and
there to accentuate the bumps hes
coming he announced and gave a last
glance around the bare little room
where the dust of his energetic sweep-
ing had not yet settled  dont envy
him the winter none and thats a
cinch he observed i dont believe a
sheep-herder could stand more than a
month here without going plumb loco
oles loco now andy asserted with
conviction if he wasnt he wouldnt
be out here at all hed be living up to
his hair in some city anti ladies would
be passing up flowers tied with wide
ribbons when he quit playing

  i dont know said pink why we
take it for granted he can play no-
bodys ever heard him

  well he can ill gamble on that
look at the way he wears his hair
and-did yuh take notice of his hands
ill bet you money lie can play

  he came sitting aloft upon the high
spring seat beside pat morrisy with a
dirty canvas horse blanket over his
broadcloth-clothed knees and the violin
case cuddled in his arms like a sleeping
child his hair like the mane of a
lion dyed with india ink fluttered in
the stiff north wind his face was as
stonily calm as the sphinx his eyes
sullen

  pat pushed the brake forward to the
last notch with a yank not far from
vicious and came skidding down the
rough slope to the cabin his whoa
the man who would play the north wind 

was a menace to his team and the very
set of his shoulders betokened distaste
for the journey and dislike for the man
beside him

  good thing were here murmured
andy apprehending the situation
pats been trying to pump ole bull
and they dont love each other a little
bit hed dump the stuff on the ground
and collect his money and drive off if
he was here alone with him

  pat came near doing that very thing
as it was he regarded the two with a
snort meant to express his scorn of
their mission unloaded as hurriedly as
might be gave another snort or two by
way of reply to andys remark that
it was a nice little drive out from town
pocketed the money which olafson
extended haughtily in his direction
climbed up to the high seat released
the brake with another yank and yelled
ferociously at his team

  it iss good said olafson when pat
had driven out of sight standing before
the cabin with his eyes greedily fixed
upon the barren coulee which seemed
all there was of the world so jealously
did it hug its barrenness to itself only
to the south did a twisted arm reach out
coaxingly to the prairie beyond so that
one glimpsed the wide land as through
a half-open doorway it iss good he
repeated and walked slowly down into
the bleak hollow with his violin case
still cuddled in his arms

  pink and andy carried in the sup-
plies and unpacked them pink also
made olafsons bed upon the board
bunk in one corner while andy
chopped wood with the new ax and
started a fire and put some coffee on
to boil

  say began andy in the tone of
one who has worked out a problem to
its logical conclusion a helpless son
of a gun like him aint going to make
out very well alone here ill bet he
never made a bed in his life or washed
a tin plate or boiled a pot of coffee
we cant hang around and be his hired
girls all the time what the deuce is
he going to do 

  pink flipped the last quilt over the
bunk so that it lay smoothly tucked in

  b

the end and pushed his hat back off his
curls

  search me he said impatiently i
was just thinking about that myself
its the darned details as he calls them
thats going to stick him if he dont
look out pie ought to be in here right
now learnin a few things about cook-
ing his own grub wheres he at any-
way

  andy went to the door looked out
and pointed an eloquent finger far
down the coulee seated upon an out-
cropping ledge of sandstone his face
upturned to the jagged coulee wall op-
posite him and to a hawk circling
slowly above it was olafson from
the lift and sweeping gestures of his
arm they knew that he was playing his
violin and as they listened certain
strains swept thin and sweet and
evanescent to their ears

  for long minutes they stood there in
the doorway and watched him and
listened for the vagrant strains which
could penetrate the distance detached
yet clearly defined like jagged peaks
thrusting nakedly up through a thick
blanket of fog which hides all else

  they did not like to disturb him
perhaps they vaguely understood that
there is an intoxication of mood which
sweeps one above and beyond the
realities of life and wipes out for the
time the physical need of food or
warmth or rest

  since it was sunday and their time
was their own they spent the next hour
in baking a supply of bread-baking-
powder bread-sufficient to last olaf-
son for several days and cooked what
other food they thought necessary for
his needs they cut a generous supply
of wood and then being hungry and
seeing no sign of olafsons immediate
return to the cabin they ate and after-
ward washed the dishes then they
mounted their horses and rode down
the coulee on their way home meaning
to speak to their strange protege and
bring him back from his dreamings
but olafson gave them no heed beyond
a stare and a negligent nod as they rode
past so they left him alone upon the
ledge and went their way


thb cpopulacr magazine

  he aint real nutty andy di-
agnosed shrewdly on the way home
hes a genius i take it and there
aint anything much you can do for
that i guess he wont starve or freeze
anyway

  so having done for him what their
humane instincts demanded of them
they rewarded themselves by making
a great tale for the ears of the happy
family a tale which was received with
incredulous jeers and set the bunk
house buzzing with argument till bed-
time

  once after that pink and andy rode
over to one-man coulee and were re-
ceived courteously enough they saw
that olafson gave slight heed to the
bothersome details and that his eat-
ing was desultory and of the kind to
breed dyspepsia they cooked a pot of
beans another supply of bread washed
his dishes and swept his floor and
olafson remembered his promise and
played for them while they worked
it was sure great stuff pink said after-
ward but there didnt seem to be much
tune to it he would greatly have pre-
ferred a two-step though he did not like
to tell olafson so

  andy who had instincts for the big-
ger things of life told him bluntly that
he ought to go buy him another musical
clock it was he accused about as high
a brand of music as he was equal to
for himself he listened intently while
olafson played and was silent long
after the music ceased looking at olaf-
son with something akin to awe in his
gray eyes and after that he frequently
rode alone to one-man coulee and sat
quiet by the broken stove and listened
to the wonderful music which olafson
drew from the violin he handled so
tenderly caressing the strings with the
light touches a mother gives to the face
of a sleeping child

  one sunday when the sky and the
leaden air promised snow and wind
and biting cold andy bethought him
of olafson alone and ignorant of
weather signs and the ill they often
foretell and rode to one-man coulee
alone the sorrel team of pat mor-

risy stood before the door with tails
tucked between shivering hind legs and
because of their presence he went in
 distrustfully within were pat and
another-a thin man in a glossy fur
coat the thin man looked up saw
only a brown-faced young man with an
unobtrusive manner and went on talk-
ing ignoring his presence olafson
hunched sullenly before the stove with
the broken front grate through which
red coals fell now and then to the
hearth listened and said nothing in
reply

   the thin man talked of a broken con-
 tract and of big seasons and of packed
 houses and money being wasted by
 olafsons insane flight from the world
 that clamored for his music

   i weel not go said olafson dog-
 gedly when the thin man came to an
 anxious pause

   but you cant stop here olafson
 the other protested think of what
 you owe the world a talent like
 yours-you cant bury it here in this
 hole and the squalor-man its sui-
 cide  nothing more or less than sui-
 cide

   it iss freedom olafson raised
 his shaggy head and looked at his old
 manager with sullen defiance always
 it iss money of which you speak the
 peoples they do not love the music-
 they love to sit weeth others and listen
 to olafson because olafson iss the
 great violinist and haff won much
 fame all my life i haff played for
 money all my life i haff hated that
 thing money you would harness
 olafson to the plow-you would make
 him vork for you-to deeg up money
 he sprang to his feet and towered over
 the other and his eyes blazed with the
 hot rebellion that surged within him

   it iss freedom he cried flinging
 out a long arm so suddenly that he
 of the glossy fur coat shrank farther
 away neffer pefore haft i been free
 always haff i been the slave-the slave
 that vorks for hire music-you would
 make of my music a slave the great
 beautiful music you would haff it come
 for hire peoples they must pay money
 if they would listen bah it iss that
the mbn who would pljy the north wind 

you make chains to bind me and my
violin to the plow he lifted his head
shaking back the mane of black hair
with an unconscious gesture of scorn
these hills they do not pay they

hear the great music of my violin-

he stopped as if his thoughts had
grown too vague for speech

  it iss enough he said with
haughty finality i am not a slave
my violin it iss not a slave  i weel
not go

  he sat down again before the stove
and brooded there and gave no further
heed to the expostulations of the man
so finally they drove away and left
him there the giant who refused longer
to plow the furrow for hire

  when they had been gone for some
time oiafson raised his head and
looked around the tiny cabin saw andy
sitting there and smiled vaguely upon
him

  it iss good they are gone and
you remain and the hills they remain
and the freedom which i came to seek
it remains also he fell to staring at
the coals as they dropped through the
broken grate so fall the years and
turn black and dead like the coals as
they fall he muttered dreamily

  the north wind which had blown in
half-hearted gusts all day with periods
of leaden quiet between rose and
whooed lonesomely around the cabin
the crooning wail of it won oiafson
from his dreams of what had been per-
haps and could never be again except
in his dreaming

  the north wind it iss of those dead
years it iss singing he said to andy
who sat quietly smoking on the other
side of the stove waiting until the im-
pulse seized oiafson to play he had
learned that olafsons music came of its
own volition or it came not at all and
he had learned also that silence and
dreams were the conjurors to call it
forth so he waited and smoked and
put more wood in the stove and
thought his own thoughts

  down the bare brown hills came an-
other song the howl of the gray wolf
as he sniffed the coming storm eerie
it come and mingled with the wailing of

the wind oiafson lifted his head and
listened to the cry and his eyes though
they still stared unseeingly were no
longer dreaming eyes intent they were
seeing more than the ears could hear

  that-it iss not of the dead years
it iss of the ages to come it iss the
song of the ages i wreel play he
listened lifted his huge body from the
creaking old chair and went into the
shadows-for the storm was bringing
an early night when he came back
he held his violin and his hands trem-
bled as they touched caressingly the
strings

  they sing he murmured to him-
self they sing the north wind and
the wolf and the wide unpeopled
prairie great iss the song-they sing
of the ages to come to-night we too
shall sing-what never pefore has been
sung by the violin we shall sing as
they are singing the north wind and
the prairie and the wolf 

  he poised the bow above the strings
and waited for the wind had lulled
for the moment and the wolf was
silent it wass for this we came my
violin and i and we did not know he
said his eyes glowing toward andy
i knew only that we hungered to be
free but it wass for this song that we
came

  they came again rising mournfully
-th north wind and the wolf sing-
ing together as they had sung when
the prairies were young the bow
dropped lightly upon the strings and
they too sang wonderfully rising
wefrdly with the long-drawn howl of
the wolf falling and murmuring with
the wind at the cabins corner andys
cigarette dropped unnoticed from his
fingers while he leaned forward and
listened

  the eyes of oiafson stared straight
before him what they saw-or what
andy sawr and so thought that oiaf-
son saw also-was a wide wide land
lying stark under a brooding night sky
with bars of faint moonlight stealing
furtively into the hollows with the
rrorth wind a great tangible shape
rushing wantonly after the moonbeams
singing shrieking when they shrank


the popular magazine

away and a lone wolf buffeted upon a
hilltop his coat roughened by the
winds ungentle hands pointing his
nose to the bleak sky and howling his
challenge to all the world

  it iss not the song of the ages to
come said olafson while he played
it iss the world-old song-the folk
song of the north wind and the prairies
and the wrolf 

  it was a wild unearthly rhapsody
that he played and the minutes slid into
hours with the sliding of his bow across
the strings it was a plaintive wailing
thing that he played and andy forgot
to feed the fire so that the room grew
chill but it vvas not the north wind
that he played nor the wolf nor the
whisper of the storm which now beat
upon the cabin

  the fingers of olafson hesitated
moved uncertainly the wind it
mimicked the wailing strings and then
whooped off into a wild song of its own
where the violin could not follow the
wolf howled derision and he could not
catch the notes of its eerie cadences
the blizzard heralded throughout the
day by leaden skies and a fitful wind
buffeted the little cabin as andy had
fancied the wolf upon the hilltop and
shook clods of earth loose from the sod
roof and sent them thudding upon the
floor

  this it iss the storm wraith of the
folk songj olafson listening mut-
tered the folk song of the wild
never before haff i lived never be-
fore haff i played until now 

  then-he played did olafson his
long lean fingers caught the visions his
staring eyes saw and carried them to
the strings of his violin while across
the stove in deep shadow andy green
held his breath and listened times he
played as blew the north wind as swept
the blizzard as howled the wolf tone
for tone sweeping waves to a passion
of sound shrieking whistling eerily like
drunken elves at revel how he played
--did olafson

  again he paused his fingers groping
for the tones to match a whining croon
at the corner his breath came in half
sobs with his striving times he had

almost caught the song but even as the
strings began to echo it exultantly it
eluded him like a mocking demon that
could never be made a captive

  oh to play the song he sprang
to his feet sobbing still playing wildly
they mock me-the north wind and
the prairie and the wolf but i shall
play their song they shall not say that
olafson olafson the master of the
violin and of music-they shall not
laugh among themselves and say that
olafson he could not play their song
i shall play it i shall triumph over
the north wind i shall laugh at the
prairie i shall send the wolf shrinking
ashamed to his den ages have they
sung the song and they alone but
to-night i the human thing and this
instrument which humans have made
we shall know their song i

  he paused just long enough to
jerk open the door and he stood
there looking out i shall know their
song i shall go to the north wind
and to the prairie and to the wolf and
they shall teach me their song ages
old-the folk song of the wind

  andy sitting there under the spell
of his playing watched him while he
stood a moment still gazing into the
night then he was gone and after
him went andy stung back to realiza-
tion of what it all meant

  he heard afar off a high sweet
strain like the wind singing in the
treetops upon a mountain then the
blizzard a white wraith came sweep-
ing past and muffled jealously the
sound so that andy stumbling blindly
after was bewildered and could not fol-
low once again he heard faintly a
single high sweet exultant note long-
drawn then the wrind whooped anew
and the blizzard flung its burden of
snow into the straining eyes of andy
green and when it lulled again the
sweet high note was still

  and though he searched and called
through half that wild night and with
daybreak summoned help and searched
anew neither andy nor any other
human ever heard again the music of
olafson the man who would play the
north wind

man is screeching in the street it is not
hard to open a shutter in my mind and
live once more right in the midst of the
musty old wilderness of seouls an-
tiquities those days of terror and of
high adventure ha when i a flat
dweller of staid brooklyn was a lord
of the golden umbrella and the girl
was an emperors kidnaper

  ill have to begin by telling who
bethell was a gadfly thats what this
squatty bull-headed little britisher was
-a gadfly whose sole aim in life was to
puncture the japanese hide in korea
during those sad years after the close
of the war with russia i dont know
where bethell came from maybe it was
nagasaki or kobe but there he was
in the city of shadows with his little


the popular magazine

four-page korea daily news before
ever the last russian was driven across
the sha-ho biting and stinging the
japanese usurpers with every stickful
of type that his korean compositors set
up

  little hagiwara hasegawas man
friday used to drop spiteful hints
about bethells newspaper being sub-
sidized by the russians i never be-
lieved him knowing that bethell in his
blind bull-charging way was convinced
of the iniquity of japans actions in the
land of the morning calm and was
quite sincere in tilting at the big wind-
mill of japanese diplomacy with his
puny pen

  and how this slashing cutting little
britisher did get under the skins of
hasegawa and megata and all of the
rest of the japanese advisers to old
emperor bugs when he showed up
the fine trade japanese counterfeiters
did in lead twenty-chon pieces-in-
voiced as nails from osaka-megata
screamed protest when he exposed
the japanese trick of appropriating
korean peasants property by the
square mile for military purposes
general hasegawa military commander
of chosen squirmed and fumed

  the empire of japan you see tri-
umphant over the russians was ap-
propriating korea which it had prom-
ised to protect as a legitimate spoil of
war but it was accomplishing its pur-
pose of absorption in a character-
istically oriental method of indirection

  and there stood bethell almost the
only champion of the koreans and of
the emperor bugs defying the japa-
nese uncovering their neat little tricks
urging the koreans to resistance at
every turn wrong he was often in-
temperate at all times but the epitaph
that ought to be carved over poor
bethells clay wherever it may lie in
that grim land of ghosts and goblins
ought to be whatsoever he did he did
with his might

  and now the girl

  one night in october-the year was
-she walked into the dining room
of looies astor house outside the
south gate of seoul and very demurely

she took her seat and begn to give her
order to pak the pussy-footed waiter
bethell and i were at our table across
the room bethell was right in the midst
of a tirade against hasegawa but he
stopped short both eyes on the new-
comer

  ripping said bethell with a little
intake of his breath and she was
tall and willowy her head sat on her
shoulders with an air of quiet assur-
ance that was good to see she had a
great coil of auburn hair piled high
above her forehead none of your soft
and melting beauty in her face no
sir her features were irregular-eyes
very wide apart and mouth too large
maybe to get a certificate from a beauty
specialist but there was a stamp of-
how shall i put it-independence yes
and glorious self-reliance and fine re-
serve on that face they combined to
make it handsome-striking

  bethell and i both itched to know
who she was and what she could be
doing in seoul where mighty few white
women except missionaries and the
wives of diplomats ever come we
raced through our meal and got looie
aside out in the bar to tell us all he
knew looie shrugged his shoulders
and cast his eyes to the ceiling

  she ees alone and for luggage-
one leetle tronk an one suit case la-
bels yes yes-from ze astor house
shanghai from ze oriental palace yo-
kohama  aussi pacific mail from san
francisco

  pak the waiter came padding into
the bar that minute and tapped bethell
on the arm

  new missis like look-see you said
pak like look-see mis bethell she
say

  bethell left the barroom with a queer
crease of perplexity between his eyes
albeit he grinned in triumph over me
he was gone almost an hour while
looie and i speculated wildly over
glasses of fernet blanca as to the
identity of the mysterious red-headed
girl and what her mission in seoul
might be

  then bethell came to the door he
beckoned me with a mysterious gesture
the cat and the king



and i left looie in a fine gallic spirit of
typhoon

  something big billy bethell whis-
pered hoarsely as the door closed be-
hind us whopping big and she the
girl and i will need you come

  bethell was humming excitedly under
his breath all the way up the rickety
stairs that led to the room called by
courtesy the ladies parlor on the
second floor of the dilapidated astor
house the girl-for thats what
bethell and i dubbed her from the first
meeting-rose to meet us as we en-
tered i can see now the coppery glory
that the light flung about her head the
level confident gleam in her two violet
eyes the fine line of power that was
drawn by her wide lips we were in-
troduced by bethell-and im not go-
ing to give the name i heard for the
girl still has work in her chosen line
to do

  now youd better tell billy every-
thing that you told me bethell then
said hes an american like your-
self  hes an american with nerve
furthermore and id trust him like my
own brother so did this big-hearted
fighting britisher flatter me with the
extravagance of his language

  the girl took a swift look about
peeped into the hall closed and locked
the door and then we three sat down
in a close circle under the ridiculous
old swinging lamp and she began to
speak her voice was low vibrant it
had a thrilling quality that would make
a man swim the gulf of pechili at its
bidding that voice those eyes made
the girl what she was-and is-a ruler
of men

  i come to seoul she said repre-
senting a certain powerful man at pres-
ent in shanghai and his name is-

the girl slipped a little gold pencil off
her chatelainc whipped a page from
a notebook she had in her pocketbook
and wrote a proper name i do not in-
tend t reveal that name now suffice
it to say that it was that of one of the
very clever men who clear the rocks
from the path of russias glacial ad-
vance through asia of one whose
hand has done more to mold history in

the far east than any other when i
had looked at the writing on the slip of
paper the girl tore the piece into very
fine particles and dropped them back
into her purse

  and all that i have to do here in
seoul is to kidnap the emperor she
added with a rare smile

  of course i was flabbergasted
bethells eyes were shining as he looked
over at me and nodded his head en-
thusiastically	

  so thats all i asked with a weak
attempt at raillery

  maybe not she answered just the
shadow of rebuke in her voice let
me explain as i have already explained
to- mr bethell the-the gentleman
whose name i have just shown you has
definite information that within the next
three weeks japan is going to make her
biggest stroke in korea marquis ito
is to come over here and force the em-
peror to sign away the sovereignty of
his country under a japanese pro-
tectorate japan has sounded eng-
land and the united states on the move
and has been told that if she can twist
affairs around so as to make it appear
that the request for a protectorate
comes from the emperor himself there
will be no notice of the steal taken by
london or washington but-and un-
derstand this- point-japan knows that
germany and especially russia whom
she is trying her best to conciliate now
the war is over would not countenance
a grab without some show of korean
willingness

  believe me it was strange to sit there
behind locked doors and listen to this
clear-eyed young woman speak of chan-
cellories and the shifting of secret bal-
ances as she might of pomeranians in
a dog show

  you know she continued that the
old emperor would rather cut off his
topknot than agree to the signing away
of his sovereignty you know that he
fears just such pressure as marquis ito
is coming over here to apply he has
already rushed hulbert to washington
to intercede with roosevelt but here
is the point if the emperors seal is
not set on that protocol of a pro-


the popular magazine

tectorate that ito is coming here to ob-
tain japan will not dare to steal korea
furthermore poor old bugs believes
that if he does not sign away his rights
the japanese will assassinate him
well the girl asked with an odd light
in her eyes whats the answer

  i shook my head i was bewildered
did not catch the drift gf her design

  why russia will offer him through
me an asylum in shanghai by flight
the old emperor will show japans hand
down on the table ito cannot put his
deal through germany and russia
wdll inquire what is happening in korea
to force its ruler to skip japan can-
not dare to fly in the face of the worlds
outraged sensibilities

  the girl threw back her gorgeous
head and laughed a silent whole-
hearted laugh-all with those big violet
eyes

  do i make a noise like a professor
in secret history she asked but
anyway you see it you catch the
spirit of this big game that my friend in
shanghai hopes to play through you
gentlemen and me see bethell was
the wtay he gave final instructions the
night before i left shanghai see
bethell and if it is possible to do the
trick bethell will do it

  and now ive seen bethell and
bethell allows me to see you mr billy
and-and the fats in the fire she
made a winsome gesture of lifting a
glass to her lips so heres to ito
horibumi marquis of japan and may
he take our dust

  i will not go into all the details of
that long whispered talk we three had
in the ladies parlor bethell gave the
girl a clear picture of what the situa-
tion was at the palace how the em-
peror and his imbecile crown prince
were surrounded by spies and tale-
bearers  what measures hasegawa had
taken to keep old bugs practically a
prisoner in his own imperial suite who
of his craven ministers had been
bought by the japanese and who re-
mained loyal though in daily terror of
their lives when he raised the ques-
tion of how the girl was to gain audi-
ence with his majesty we had another

glimpse of the remarkable resource of
this friend of diplomats

  why i have come to seoul to paint
his majestys portrait she answered
with a confident smile i have already
painted the portrait of the old dowager
empress in peking and the dear old
lady gave me an autograph letter and
hung me around with jade chains till i
looked like a christmas tree and be-
sides i have some other certificates of
character

  she went to her trunk and brought
out a thin packet of papers one was
a letter from a very big man in wash-
ington  another bore the signature of
the american minister to china still a
third was from the wife of the british
ambassador-at tokyo

  my tickets of admission to the em-
perors palace she laughed

  bethell and i took our leave about ten
oclock and went down to the bar to
talk things over further maybe it was
midnight and we were still over looies
single battered pool table when the
silence was split by a pistol shot

  looie came running into the bar from
his little office where he had been nod-
ding away his regular nightly potations
there was a sound of pattering feet in
the servants quarters behind the hotel
the watchman at the gate set up an in-
fernal shaking of his iron staff clut-
tered with tinkling rings

  a clear voice came down from the
head of the stairs above just as we
were moving from the bar out into the
central hallway

  will somebody come up to my
room -it was the girls voice bethell
and i exchanged glances of apprehen-
sion-i have just had to shoot a
burglar

  we found her-looie and bethell
and i-standing under the light of the
little bracket lamp in the hall a long
figured-crape kimono covered her night-
dress  two great ropes of shining burnt
gold hung down over each shoulder
alive with light in the contrast with the
pale green of the kimono she held a
short heavy automatic concealed under
the folds of the kimono where she had
gathered it about her breast
the cat and the king



  she did not say a word as we came
panting up to where she stood but
motioned that looie bring the lamp
she preceded us into her room and
nodded to a little alcove jutting out
into the broad balcony which girdled
the second story of the hotel there
her trunk stood opened by it was a
sprawling blotch of blue-the blue of
the japanese coolies surtout

  it was bethell who turned the dead
man over so that his coarse simian face
with its topping brush of black wire
hair lay in the light bethell looked up
at the girl with a quizzical face

  yes she said in a flat emotionless
voice beginning right away are they
not

chapter ii

  it was stevens who arranged the
audience with his majesty two days
after the girls arrival in seoul i be-
lieve that this was the only mistake
stevens ever made he was you see
adviser to the japanese advisers of the
korean government-the shrewd cal-
culating wheel within a wheel who
earned all the tokyo ministry paid him
by directing the devious course of its
diplomacy at that grand old mud heap
of seoul i do not believe stevens
would have interested himself at all in
the girls case if she hadnt turned the
full battery of her eyes upon him and
incidentally shown him that letter from
the very big man at washington at
any rate stevens opened the way to the
palace and thither we went the girl
and i on a sparkling october morn-
ing it was no trick for me to have
audience with the emperor because as
exalted deputy collector of the imperial
customs and possessor of the order of
the golden umbrella i always went
armed with a double-barreled open
sesame

  my friend she said turning a quiet
smile into my eyes as i sat by her side
in the state carriage which had been
sent to fetch us this is the biggest
game ive ever stalked and-and i am
supremely happy 

  and not the least bit afraid i
queried the other night you know

-that japanese who came in to look
over your trunk the littlest cog in the
admirable spy machine here in seoul
what he might have done-

  she interrupted me with a low laugh
thrilling with suppressed animal spirits

  clumsy-clumsy said the girl
these little brown brothers are very
elemental after all now in russia or
france a polite agent of the secret
service would have waited until one wras
away from ones room-and then would
not have disturbed so much as a pleat
in ones dinner gown when going
through the trunk but here they send
a burglar-to be sacrificed

  so the girl rode to meet adventure
with a laugh on her lips through the
twisted streets of this ancient heap of
ruins-the city of a thousand years
sleep-passed a bronze-haired semi-
ramis bound on a mission to steal an
emperor and there was i chained by
her eyes her voice her superb spirit
of daring deliberately following into a
labyrinth of oriental guile from which
there well might be no return yet i
went fatuously i felt like dartagnan
riding into paris to snatch a prize from
fate at the end of a long sword

  in the anteroom of the audience
chamber we found little hagiwara the
ubiquitous eyes and ears of general
hasegawa-hagiwara the suave and
smiling master of the emperors court
under whose scowl the craven korean
palace fixtures cringed and at whose
bidding convenient suicides were ar-
ranged a dapper little jackal was
hagiwara whose teeth were very sharp
and whose bark was more terrifying
to the old emperor bugs than the gib-
bering of all his ancestors ghosts
hagiwara had of course been apprised
of our coming he advanced over the
outlandish purple and blue carpet of the
anteroom with dainty catlike tread i
introduced him

  ah mr hagiwara your friend
mitono of the consulate in shanghai
commended you to me before i left for
seoul the girls velvety voice was
purring and soft he told me that
you were a man of influence in the
court here but that you were so im-


the popular magazine

pervious to feminine appeal that i must
be an unusual woman to win your
favor

  yiss-ah-yiss hagiwara ducked
his close-cropped head and smiled with
every angle of his face lie came up
standing under the full fire of those
two big eyes the girl was still hold-
ing the tips of his fingers

  but i am sure mr hagiwara that
you are not so terrible a monster as you
have been painted surely you will not
growl at a poor portrait painter who
comes to seek your protection in this
terribly barbarous court

 no-ah-no babbled hagiwara
his face flushing scarlet

  the girl had him hooked she drew
him confidentially aside as if she would
give him some secret too precious for
my ears i watched them out of the
corner of one eye there stood the
girl radiant wonderful in the softly
clinging silk and voile of her paris
gown and the sweeping white plumes
that drooped to brush her burnished
hair her head was bent slightly so that
she might bring her lips closer to ilagi-
waras ear-a delicately personal and
confiding gesture--and her hands were
clasped before her in a pantomime of
mock appeal

  i heard a trickle of silvery laughter
yiss-yiss said hagiwara eagerly
and he turned to lead us into the audi-
ence chamber as the girl passed me
there was just the slightest lift of her
eyebrows and mischief flashed from
her eyes

 poor old bugs he had so many
things to worry him in those dark days
of the decay of his state and the weav-
ing of snares about his feet it was
hardly fair that the old codger should
be put to the shock of the girls gal-
vanic presence i remember how he
sat in his outlandish stuffed plum-
colored silk robes and the aureole of
horsehair crown about his head all
huddled together on his teak and
marble throne about him were
clustered all of the goat-eyed ministers
and soothsayers and geomancers the
leeches sticking to the tottering throne
each decked out in the outlandish pur-

ples and whites of the official court cos-
tume and bonneted with the inevitable
horsehair flytraps the wonderful old
chinese screen representing the moun-
tains of the moon and a ramping
dragon trailing his scaly length across
them which stood behind the throne
furnisheu appropriate background for
this shadow court of a dejd nation

  i can see now the look of wonder
that flashed into the tired eyes of old
bugs as the vision of gently undulat-
ing gossamer and silk topped with the
red-gold coils and the trailing white
plumes flowed-thats the word-down
the long room and paused with a deep
curtsy before the steps of the throne

  the girl lifted her eyes filled with
awe and deference to the wrinkled face
of the monarch and remained in the
difficult pose of obeisance until with a
surprised grunt old bugs scrambled to
his padded feet and extended his hand
in a gracious gesture she made a tre-
mendous sensation courtiers waggled
their beards in excited whispers behind
the emperors back witch doctors and
sign readers buzzed the news of the
girls coming out through side doors
and alleyways hagiwara who stood
boldly in front of the throne fussed
with the tips of his collar and seemed
on the point of choking

  it was prince alin yung a right de-
cent sort and unswerving in his loyalty
to the emperor during all the whirlwind
of intrigue who acted as interpreter
the emperor extended himself in pretty
phrases tie wanted to know by what
kindness of the gods his poor court had
been honored by the presence of so fair
a stranger he heard right away that
the girl who was a humble painter
person fjom america and who had en-
joyed the honor of putting on canvas
the sacred features of the dowager of
china could not feel that life was com-
plete until she had done similarly by his
augustness of whose greatness and
glory she had heard wondrous tales in
far-away america

  the palaver was rich in metaphor
and dripping with courtesy old bugs
wras plainly tickled casting an appre-
hensive eye upon hagiwara his majesty
the cat and the king



answered that he would have to take the
girls request under advisement it was
an unusual favor that she asked he was
not at all sure that he would not sicken
and die if his features were transferred
to canvas he would have to get the ad-
vice of his spook doctors however
since the empress dowager of china
had not died as the result of her ex-
perience -he was prone to look with
favor upon the american ladys peti-
tion he would beg that she return to
the palace on the morrow and receive
his decision

  the emperor was eager as a child to
find excuse for keeping the girl longer
in his presence i did not blame him
poor old beggar for trying to keep a
sunbeam in that musty old audience
chamber whose very walls whispered
plots but his visitor knew the value
of a pleasure deferred and she made a
graceful excuse for vithdrawing from
the presence of the little nephew of
heaven she was not allowed to go
however until his majesty had in-
structed one of his chamberlains to
show the radiant american stranger the
beauties of his deer park and summer
pavilion

  we went out of the palace to the
wildwood behind but the chapfallen
chamberlain did not have a chance to
show any of the quaint beauties of tilted
gable and carven lions hagiwara did
that the little japanese strutted by
the girls side as if he were stepping
on rose leaves t who kept at a
distance behind with the chamberlain
could hear the patter of his syncopated
english broken by occasional gusts of
the girls full-throated laughter hagi-
wara was completely by the ears
when he handed the girl into the car-
riage after our tour of the deer park
he insisted that she must accept his in-
vitation to the garden party that was
to be given the following week at the
japanese legation it was in celebra-
tion of the birthday of the emperor of
japan

  a very cute little mouse-hagi-
wara was the only comment my com-
panion made during the drive down to
the south gate and the hotel

  yes and the cruelest little mouse in
this whole worm-eaten house i added

  he did not beg my pardon for set-
ting his unfortunate spy to work on
me the girl mused but he will-
oh yes he will-before i amthrough
with him

  the wife of the american minister
was waiting when we arrived at the
astor house and she took the girl over
to the legation quarters for tiffin and
the afternoon i went immediately to
bethells little printing shop over back
of furniture street and there in his
dowdy office we had our heads together
for the better part of the afternoon
bethell who knew the underground
channels of palace approaches as well as
any korean dispatched an oral message
to prince min yung-that we must see
the prince at his home over by the west
gate that night at all hazards was the
tenor of the message

  we made our devious way after dark
separately and each by a different route
to the princes house caution and not
a little back-fence climbing were neces-
sary because the prince on account of
his known loyalty to the emperor and
his constant scheming to block the japa-
nese game was honored by the constant
surveillance of hagiwaras spies

  i can never forget the dramatic qual-
ity of that meeting in the darkened
guest room of this real korean patriot
we-bethell and i-had come like
thieves in the night and like thieves we
sat about the single rushlight which
stood on an inlaid teak stand amid the
tobacco jars and the dull-gleaming am-
ber seals of the princes office and
spoke in whispers

  bethell told the prince of the means
by which the old emperor might be de-
livered from all the menace and the
bullying of his enemies explained how
by flight to a russian asylum in shang-
hia the harried monarch could call the
attention of the whole world to his
plight and prevent the absorption of
his empire by the japanese the fight-
ing british editor urged the merits of
the great scheme with the enthusiasm
of a crusader

  prince min yung listened to the end


the popular magazine

his hand was trembling as he reached
out to tamp the bowl of his long pipe

  it is wonderful-wonderful he
whispered at last if only we can per-
suade his majesty not since the be-
ginning of time has a king of korea
fled beyond his borders his sooth-
sayers and wise men will all persuade
against it

  but they must not know bethell
broke in impetuously they are all
secretly in japanese pay and if a word
a whisper of this should get to their
ears hasegawa would have the palace
surrounded by troops within an hour
you-you alone-must have the secret
you must find a way to-morrow to get
a word to his majestys ear to tell him
why the girl comes to paint his por-
trait there will be private sittings
you must be on hand to act as in-
terpreter then you and she alone
with the emperor can convince him of
the wisdom of this course every de-
tail of the flight can be arranged be-
tween you during the hours his majesty
gives up to the sittings

  it shall be so prince min yung
said and bethell and i took our leave
-through the stabie yard and over the
walls into the compound of the meth-
odist mission

  before noon the next day an im-
perial secretary arrived at the astor
house with a message for the girl
from the emperor bugs his majesty
would be graciously pleased to have the
distinguished american artist paint his
portrait and his majesty awaited her
immediate visit to the palace with pleas-
urable anticipation

  not until after the girl had rolled
through the south gate in the imperial
carriage her easel frames and paint
box following in great state on the
backs of two palace porters did bethell
draw me aside in the deserted bar of
looies

  the lightnings striking closer every
minute he said in a low serious voice
i got it straight from the palace this
morning that two of the emperors
mutang sorcerers died last night
they ate a venison pie which the old
boy refused to touch

chapter iii

  after that first sitting of doddering
majesty the girl moved from the old
astor house over to the home of the
american minister she jumped at the
invitation which came from the min-
isters wife who like all of us there in
seoul had been completely captivated
by the dazzling personality of this re-
markable woman and had been avid
also to seize the advantage which pos-
session of this much talked-about young
painter would give in the jealous circle
of legation society

  the girl for her part was doubly
eager to make the change to be offi-
cially adopted into the legation family
was to remove the last possible suspi-
cion as to the object of her mission
from the cunning mind of hagiwara
and his crew

  the american ministers compound
abutted on the rear of the palace
grounds and it was but a step from
there to the rear of the building wherein
old bugs was practically a prisoner
moreover she could not afford to con-
tinue living in the neighborhood of
bethell who was pariah in the minds
of the japanese and was always
watched

  i am frank to say that i would have
preferred for purely personal reasons
that the girl remain at the hotel be-
sides the exalted glamour of the ad-
venture upon which i had embarked

with her there was-yes there was-

but pshaw this is not to be a love
story no room here for that sort of
stuff

  she gave me a few minutes while she
was putting her effects together in the
hotel room preparatory to moving

  mr billy she said weve got to
play the game apart for the next few
days i cannot afford to see bethell or
be seen with him i am not so sure
that you are on the list of the unco
guid with little hagiwara either but
prince mn yung will provide a way
for me to pass messages to both of you
without being detected

  i assured her that i would obliterate
myself utterly rather than risk being a
the cat an the king



stumblingblock in the path of her great
scheme

  oh no my friend she said laugh-
ing up at me her eyes dancing with the
surge and rush of the big hazard we
were playing i will not allow you
to say the carriage waits in this lit-
tle melodrama when your cue comes
you will have the spotlight all to your-
self  but in the meantime-

  she brought out of a pocket in the
lining of her trunk a cable form al-
ready filled and handed it to me i
looked at it curiously it was ad-
dressed to one of her name at shang-
hai and read portrait successful
hurrah her name was attached

  no not to my father she said
reading the query in my eyes but to
the man who is behind all this plan of
ours-the one whose name i gave you
the night i arrived here innocent
enough isnt it just a happy girl
telling the good news of her success to
her tladdy well you keep this my
friend when you get word from me
file it yourself not here but down at
chemulpo where hagiwaras eye is
weak dont fail to get it off immedi-
ately for when i give the wtord for its
filing hours will count

  do you mind telling me- i be-

gan-

  certainly not this is it the in-
stant that our good friend in shanghai
receives this message he will send an-
other to chefoo on the pechili coast
and just ninety miles away from
chemulpo you know that wire will
start a swift little steam yacht away
from her moorings and within twenty-
four hours that yacht will be tied up on
the river just ten miles from seoul
that neat little boat will have accom-
modations aboard for one emperor one
portrait painter and-here she slowly
lowered an eyelid at me in mock seri-
ousness-and two wicked conspirators
who might not like to make the ac-
quaintance - of the lord high execu-
tioner

  i chortled exultingly as she unfolded
this detail of the carefully designed
plot as a matter of fact it had not
occurred to me how we were going to

bundle a fussy old emperor out of his
realm even if he did consent to skip

  and how did you make it to-day
with his nobs i asked

  she shook her head

  i am not going to tell you she
laughed back and then all of a sud-
den the mirth fled from her eyes and
they deepened into seriousness the
girl came up to me and laid a hand
upon mine in a frank comradely way

  listen my dear friend her voice
was low and there was a certain rough
huskiness in it as of emotion scarce
restrained we must not forget-
bethell and you and i-that the loser
in this game will pay yes heavily
only since i have been here have i
realized how desperate are the forces
against which we are matched all
three of us might drop out of sight in
this ghostly whirlpool of intrigue and
there wouldnt be a ripple to mark our
disappearance

  i closed my fingers over the hand and
tried to read something besides the im-
personal earnestness in her eyes

  i am not going to let you become
involved any more than i have to she
continued should you ever have to
defend yourself before a secret court
-and with death waiting behind the
judges chair-you will know only this
and that but not all you are satis-
fied that it should be thus are you not
my friend

  i lifted her hand and kissed it that
seemed at the time the fitting thing--
the only answer

  then she went away to the american
ministers home

  three nerve-racking days followed
with not a word from the girl bethell
and i forgathered each night in looies
bar and made weak efforts to pass the
hours over the ancient pool table but
to no purpose the sense of our im-
potency weighed heavily upon us we
felt that we were in chains while one
woman with magnificent courage was
digging a mine under the japanese
trenches bethell into whose heart
much of the fatalism of the land had
bitten was prone to believe that no
human agency could avail to check the


thb populajz magazine



swift-moving avalanche that was
sweeping clown upon the country from
the eruptive islands to the east for
my part i believed that nothing could
check the fruition of the great scheme
but i was burning with eagerness to
play some part in it

  then on the third night came the
message from the palace how prince
min yung had contrived the circuitous
channel of its delivery passed my com-
prehension for it was one of bethells
printers who tiptoed in the bar from a
rear entrance and whispered some-
thing in the vernacular into the editors
ears bethells eyes snapped

  she says to fire that message over
the cable he breathed and quickly

  the dash that i made through the
sleeping streets of that dead old town
to catch the last night train to che-
mulpo sixty miles away was a record-
breaker i know that my ricksha boy
must have laid off from work for three
days thereafter but i got the train
reached chemulpo at midnight and filed
the cable the fact that the cable of-
fice was in the same building with the
customs where i made my headquar-
ters two days in each week and thati
was a figure of importance in both of-
fices disarmed any suspicion that might
have grown out of my midnight visit
and the filing of a seemingly unim-
portant message as luck would have
it the japanese cable inspector was oft
duty and the korean operator did not
have intelligence beyond the keys of his
instrument

  the rest of the dark hours of that
night i spent on the balcony of chou
hongs foreign hotel outside of the
room assigned to me there i sat and
smoked with my eyes traveling over
the lights in the harbor out and out to
the yellow sea and beyond i strove
to pierce the dark and bridge the miles
between myself and shanghai to watch
the sudden springs of action which
those three silly words of the girls
cablegram would release there in his
office that master craftsman of russian
diplomacy would receive the spark
which meant that the trap in this moldy
old land of the past was read- to be

sprung he would send another spark
rushing under the waters to chefoo
off there in the dim north and then-
then out of the mists of the pechili
gulf would come swiftly furtively the
yacht which was to carry away an
emperor

  the spell of the whole cunning ma-
chinery the well-oiled cogs and pistons
of this daring engine of diplomacy had
me in its grip as i sat there under chill
stars  but always my thoughts fled back
to that dingy-walled city sixty miles
behind me where a woman with burnt
gold hair and eyes of violet wide apart
was matching her wits single-handed
against the craft and guile of a
predatory nation

   i saw her the next morning strange
chance dictated the meeting and a
stranger fortune put me in the way of a
delicious comedy

  upon my return from chemulpo to
seoul i went directly to the palace for
it was necessary that i should have a
conference with the japanese adviser
of the treasury upon matters concern-
ing the customs

   megata for he was the adviser wras
closeted with old bugs engaged doubt-
less in tightening the screws some-
where i strolled into the old palace
yard of kweng-pok a favorite musing
place for me what with the hint of mys-
tery and the whisper of lost glory in
the gray gables of its deserted pavilions
and audience halls

   i was sitting on the jutting balcony
of the old royal library shadowed by
great siberian firs when i heard a
voice it was the girls

   the clear lilting notes of her speech
and the heavy blurred accents of a
voice i knew instantly to be iiagiwaras
drew steadily nearer until finally i
judged by the sound that they had
paused directly below the library bal-
cony whereon i was standing i was
placed in the very willing position of an
eavesdropper

  no mr hagiwara i heard the
gild say i do not flatter myself in the
least that i receive such close attention
from you i have heard what your
business is here in seoul
the cat and the king



 excoos me madam hagiwara
hastened to interpose and there was a
strange strangling timbre in his voice
excoos me i do not understand
--

  oh yes you do the girl inter-
rupted any girl but myself might
have believed-might have convinced
herself that somehow you found her
charming any girl likes to be flattered
that way you know and one might-
yes one might almost learn to be
pleased if she thought that there
was a shadow of something soft and
sweet in the girls voice here cal-
culated to make little hagiwaras heart
skip a beat but you mr hagiwara
have been following me keeping your
eyes on me for just one reason you
cannot deny it

  and that reason iss-that reason iss

that you are beau-tiful that i-

  stop what a ring of command
there was in that short word i could
picture the quick fires that burned in
the girls eyes as she uttered it that
reason is mr hagiwara that you think
me a spy confess it

  the japanese bubbled and gurgled in
his effort at denial never never had
he entertained such a thought it was
impossible beyond belief

  the girl shut him off imperiously
why did you send a spy to search
my trunk the first night i was in
seoul  there was a pitiful catch and
quaver in the putting of that question
outraged dignity called for reparation

  i did not think-i did not know
hagiwara stammered

  but you sent him tell the truth
mr hagiwara

  it was a mistake excoos i was
blind i was a-fraid of plot beau-tiful
madam you were speaking with beth-
ell immediately upon your arrivals
bethell is dangerous person i sent a
man to inves-tigate ver clumsy ex-
coos  and you shot him for which i
am ver happy hagiwara was floun-
dering hopelessly i could hardly re-
strain a chuckle

  and i understand that you sincerely
apologize her voice was all silk and
tenderness again

  on my knees beau-tiful madam

  then let us have an understanding
mr hagiwara during my minutes
with his majesty in these past few days
when i am very very busy trying to
catch the spirit of his portrait you have
insisted on remaining in the room with
us your presence disturbs his majesty
who greatly fears you and it disturbs
me i had thought you were there be-
cause you wanted to keep an eye on me
lest i was plotting with the poor old
dear now i know that you had no
such purpose but mr hagiwara-
melting sweetness was in her voice now
and her words dropped hesitatingly
and with maidenly modesty-you must
promise to give me my sittings with his
majesty alone hereafter and then
maybe-maybe-

  yiss-yiss 

  maybe i will find more minutes to
give to mr hagiwara of japan-
alone said the girl with a quick little
laugh altogether alluring

  i  heard the swish of her skirts and
dared to peep over the edge of the
balcony i saw the glory of her head
splashed with light that sifted through
the far-flung bows of the pines and i
watched the supple rhythm of her
shoulders shadow-spotted as with lit-
tle hagiwara hurrying by her side she
crossed the old arched bridge with a
free stride and swung into the path
leading to the palace

  the jackals jaws were muzzled

chapter iv

  a japanese messenger one of hagi-
waras men was waiting for me when
i returned to the astor house for tiffin
he had a note addressed to me in the
girls hand it read

  dear mr billy  would it be troubling
you too much to run down to chemulpo
some time this evening so that you may
expedite through all the horrid port regu-
lations a party of friends of mine-hunters
after tigers or some other dreadful ani-
mals-who are coming from chefoo on their
yacht i received word that they were
coming some time to-night or early to-mor-
row morning but they seemed in doubt
whether in the disturbed condition of the
country they and their guns would be mis-


the popular- magazine

taken for a filibustering expedition i know
that as a customs officer you will be able
to render them some very much appreciated
service

  p s-they might bring you up the river
a way on the boat it would be a delightful
little jaunt

  the impudence of it to send me
specific directions thus by the hand of
hagiwaras own man i smiled in-
wardly when i considered this second
tally which the girl was scoring against
the jackal down to chemulpo i
went and at the high tide came the
yacht-a long low trim little thing
whose every line spelled speed

  consider the shock i received when i
discovered that the fatuous hagiwara
had already telegraphed orders to
smooth the official way for the yachts
passage into and through the harbor
of chemulpo more of the girls del-
icate work

  i boarded the yacht at the quay pre-
sented the girls letter to monsieur
reynard a trim blond young french-
man who was in command and who
had with him two companions french-
men both and a crew of five my let-
ter was my introduction but both
monsieur reynard and myself were
scrupulous not to go behind the bald
statement of facts concerning the hunt-
ing trip therein contained neither
knew the extent of the others orders
or knowledge and the next day i served
as ex-officio pilot up the han river
whose every flat and bar i knew
through years of snipe hunting on its
waters we dropped anchor midway
between the village of angjou and the
walls of seoul itself in a sequestered
bend of the river very close to the main-
traveled road out of the north gate
and not more than six miles from the
city the frenchmen said that this
very place looked the likeliest for snipe
i agreed with them and left them
promising to return in a few days and
have some sport

  i thought i detected a flicker of mirth
in reynards eyes when i gave that
promise but he made no comment

  i wtas back in seoul by noon and
that night i vent with bethell to the
home of prince min yung the prince

was trembling with excitement and
could scarce wait until we were secure
from listening ears before he began to
pour out the-story of the past few days
at the palace

  the emperor seemed ready for the
flight he said in the first breath but we
must make haste while he was in a
favorable mood the old codger had
at first been terrified out of his stuffed
boots at the thought of attempting to
escape the all-seeing eye of the japa-
nese  had sworn that they would catch
him and cut his heart out but the girl
had played on his fears as  a stringed
instrument prince min yung declared
she had painted for him with words
even as she wielded her brush on can-
vas the picture of the impending rape
of the empire by ito he the emperor
in chains and transferred to some japa-
nese prison the country drenched in
blood and his subjects enslaved

  all this almost under the nose of
hagiwara who was dodging in and out
of the retiring room where his majesty
sat for his portrait until that very day
when he was strangely absent the
poisoning of the two mutang by meat
meant for the emperors mouth had
driven the poor old monarch into a
spasmof fear the prince said and he
had decided that it was better to be
killed in flight than to sit supinely on a
tottering throne

  that wonderful woman the prince
murmured over and over again she
has held the heart of the emperor in
her hand since first she came to the
palace the minutes that we have been
alone his majesty and the artist and i
have been hundreds of golden years for
the hope of korea now the emperor
is hot-now he is cold once he says
that he will fly and the light in that
womans eyes is beautiful to see then
he shivers on his seat of state and says
that he cannot go

  prince min yung in his excitement
acted for us the craven old monarch
eyes roving and palsied hands trembling
in alternate gusts of hope and of
despair

  once he says that he will have to
consult the soothsayers and get a favor-
the cat and the king



able time set for his departure he can-
not take such an important step without
the consent of the gods and devils

  what your majesty says this
woman of the burning hair are you
not emperor lord of all in earth will
you be fooled to your destruction by
these traitorous witch doctors see i
am painting the face of a monarch-
not of a fool and at that his majesty
falls to weeping and calling himself an
idiot oh gentlementragedy and
comedy were there too strong to bear

  bethell and i managed to gain from
the excited patriot some idea of the
plans for the kidnaping of the emperor
which he and the girl had formulated
between them no one not even old
bugs ministers who were believed to
be loyal was to be in the secret his
majesty had been persuaded without
much argument to leave his half-witted
son behind he was to disguise him-
self as one of the palace mutang when
the time came for the secret departure
leave the palace in the company of the
prince by one of the devious rear
passages through the womens quarter
and find horses waiting in a corner of
the deserted deer park bethell and i
were to be waiting outside of the lit-
tle-used north gate in the citys walls
to convey the old gentleman to the
yacht

  as for the girl she was not to take any
part in the actual flight through the city
but she would be on hand at the north
gate to accompany us to the yacht
whose position in the river she had not
yet learned

  i will arrange for the horses the
prince assured us you cannot do that
yourselves without danger all that we
depend upon you to do is to form a
fitting escort for his majesty on the ride
from the city walls to the yacht he
will be in terror of the japanese every
foot of the way your presence will re-
assure him now keep yourself in
readiness for the word from the mas-
terful woman who holds the destinies
of all of us in her hand

  so bethell and i went back to the
astor house to await the striking of the
appointed hour

  b

  the next day marquis ito came

  can i picture the thunderclap of
that event how the cloud which had
been hanging as a dread menace over
korea for so many months suddenly
split and dropped to earth this man of
blood and steel-the nation builder of
japan with sinister skill the japa-
nese had concealed his approach to
koreas capital no one knew until he
saw that morning file after file of
troops with fixed bayonets marching
away from the station with the bis-
marck of the orient in their midst
the day was the national holiday of
japan-the emperors birthday that
this should be the day chosen for the
arrival of ito in seoul was in itself suf-
ficient presage of what was to follow
in supreme confidence the mikados
government had selected this day when
sun flags flew over every japanese hut
in korea to send to the emperor bugs
the high priest of his nations immola-
tion

  bethell and i were talking over the
days stupedous event on the piazza
of the hotel at noontime wondering
whether the arrival of ito would drive
poor old bugs yammering into our
arms for instant flight or so stun the
old ruler with terror as to wipe utterly
from his mind all hope of escape when
a sergeant of the american legation
guard came up with a note for us it
was from the girl

  to-night or never very recent events
have served to put the sick man in a fear-
ful state jof mindand he is wavering again
unless the medicine is administered at once
he will be beyond cure see me at the
garden party at the japanese legation this
afternoon if possible if not-to-night at
the place appointed

  i had completely forgotten the garden
party in the swirl of events though as
an official of the korean government i
had been formally invited several days
before a simple celebration of the
japanese emperors birthday we had
supposed it would be-the girl and i
now it was plain that in honor of
japans greatest statesman the event
had been planned

  i went to the garden party

  not in years had decayed old seoul


the popular magazine

witnessed such a spectacle of brilliance
the japanese those masters at touching
up the high lights of nature had con-
verted the spacious grounds in the le-
gation compound into a second nikko
not a square yard that was not
clogged with exquisite greenery-little
pine trees dwarf forests of bamboo
and the flaming sprays of the japanese
maple here a miniature pagoda its
nine gables bung with tinkling bells
there a rustic bridge spanning some
lotus-filled pond above all a spider
web of fluttering tissue flags of the na-
tions and the hundreds of golden-glow-
ing lanterns

   all of the legation staffs of the vari-
ous nations represented in seoul with
their ladies were there-a brilliant and
changing throng gold-laced and silk-
frocked and there by the side of the
japanese minister hasegawa in full
war panoply flanking him on the left
stood the man who was to take korea
in his fingers and snap its national life
of a thousand years

   a striking figure above the aver-
age height of the japanese massive
head firmly set on broad shoulders
there was the subtle hint of strength
and tremendous vital force in the poise
of his body but the face of the man
it had been chipped from primordial
 granite with rough flint tools the
straggling white beard scarcely con-
cealed the blunt outthrust chin of the
fighter the mouth was a thin slit all
force and obstinacy but it was in the
eyes and brows that the latentstrength
most lay his eyes were those of a
bronze mask shadowed by overhanging
flesh which curtained all flicker of emo-
tion allowed no flash of thought to
escape undisguised they saw every-
thing revealed nothing above was
the heavy forehead of the thinker
massy suggestive of a will which dom-
inated the imperious nature of the man
and gave it restrained force that was
ito eldest of the elder statesmen real
sire of the giant of the far east

   i was presented to the great man in
my turn and then i began a furtive
search for the girl i found her the
center of a group of japanese notables

with hagiwara hovering slavishly at
her elbow i cannot hope to reproduce
here the sallies of wit the ready pleas-
antries allof the verbal ammunition of
a past mistress in the art of social gen-
eralship by which this dazzling woman
kept ever under her power a devoted
circle of slant-eyed gallants indeed
her japanese admirers had to share her
attentions with several men from the
legations who occasionally managed to
break through the embargo but i no-
ticed that the girl carefully played her
cards so as to keep by her always the
sedulous higawara she seemed to be
using hagiwaras countrymen as a sort
of screen to protect her assault in force
which was upon that selfsame un-
suspecting little dandy not for near
half an hour did i manage to get within
safe earshot of her and that was for
the few minutes that hagiwara was ab-
sent on a mission of forage for del-
icacies

  oh billy she said with a little gasp
and dropping the playful formality of
the mister pray for me that i may
keep hagiwara here for another hour
the crisis is on at the palace hagi-
wara possesses a dreadful sixth sense of
premonition and he has been trying to
make a break for the old emperors
audience chamber ever since i arrived
he must not he-

  the girl interrupted herself to turn
a neat epigram against the bold advance
of a german secretary of legation
the blundering squire dropped back

  what is the crisis i whispered

  oh poor old bugs is beside himself
with fear-says he wont budge unless
he gets some sign from heaven or the
earth beneath prince min yung is
with him and bethell dared to slip into
the palace in the absence of hagiwara
they are arguing with the old boy-
they tell him that if not to-night it will
be never for ito will visit the palace
to-morrow and then-the end i must
-i must keep hagiwara away until
they have persuaded the emperor
finally i believe-i hope that we will
win to-night bethell can tell you
definitely at the astor house at six
oclock
the cat and the king



  hagiwara his hands crammed with
dishes appeared down the aisle of
shrubbery

  run along now billy she urged
and be prepared to jump out of korea
itself if worse comes to wforst theyll
strike in the dark you know if they
get desperate and-and nobody wants
to be a damp demnition body

  bravely she laughed though there
were dark shadows of doubt in the
limpid depths of her eyes for the first
time since she had engaged on this high
adventure i left her side with the tell-
tale message of those eyes a cold weight
on my heart

  never have i lived six swifter hours
than those which followed nor ones
which so nearly whirled me off my feet

  bethell scarce able to restrain his
excitement met me at the hotel he
dragged me into the deserted bar
helped himself to a hooker of rum
tossed it down and spoke

  its a go-a ripping roaring go 
he chuckled the old rooster at last
has caved you know and now he says
the fourteen devils of mokpu cannot
saop him from flying to-night

  yes-yes old fellow not a word
all arranged the prince will take hftn
out of the palace down to queen mins
summerhouse there horses will be
the prince looked after that you and
i to the north gate at ten oclock by
ricksha there horses for us both and
one for the girl right-o we wait
outside the gate in a little clump of
deserted houses there until along comes
his nibs all wrapped around in a coat
like a stuffed mummy

  out we go and join him and the
prince then away to the yacht and
the devil take old ito the rotter

      sanguine was bethell that i could
not get him to admit that the girls
seeming fears of failure were well
grounded i asked him what he and i
were to do if everything went well and
the emperor actually got away to
china suspicion surely would fall
upon us

  oh drat it man well face the mu-
sic said the fighting editor they

cant do more than deport us you know
unless they hire some rough to stick a
knife between our ribs but you see
dear fellow theyve tried that jolly trick
on me so many times and my inward
parts are still capable of holding good
liquor without dripping

  ten oclock and bethell and i riding
through the ghostly streets of seoul in
our curtained rickshas never did that
old charnel house of dead grandeur ap-
pear so unworldly as on that night
black gables of temples the great
bronze belly of the old bell the mush-
room growth of thatched housetops
everywhere like fungus in a witches
fen all melting and blending into
shadows-shadows not a soul stir-
ring on the streets hardly a streak
of light slipping through the clink of
some unbarred door to make the
streets seem real seoul at night is
mournful enough  but that night-ugh 

  we dismissed our rickshas at the
north gate and walked through the
wide portal two korean soldier guards
hardly rousing from their sleep to no-
tice us beyond a hundred yards and
behind the ruins of a house which had
been burned we found our horses
there we waited not speaking a word

  minutes passed-ten fifteen twenty
then a step on the gravel near the road-
way i peeked around the corner of a
blank wall and saw a hooded figure ap-
proaching alone i stepped from the
shadow

  billy came the whisper the girl
ran up to me and laid a cold hand on
mine

  all right-all right she breathed
before ever i could put a question
and bethell yes i knew youd be
here too ah whats that

  i felt her hand tremble on mine and
a quick catch came in her breath the
rapid notes of a bugle call high and
thin sounded from beyond the serrated
black mass of the citys walls instantly
it was answered by another just those
two quavering voices in the night but
what were they saying for us  the
pitiful korean army knew no bugles
but the japanese troops camped on
namsan hill-they had bugles


the popcjur magazine

   tara-tara-tara

  do you know dear friends-the
girl was trying to make her voice sound
brave and confident-i believe our
japanese brothers are calling to us over
there i believe they want to see us
very badly

   as if in answer to the girls words
came suddenly the clickety-click of
horses hoofs on gravel nearer and
nearer then the hoof beats stopped
and the low voice of min yung called
a hail from the road each to his horse
and we three were out in the road by
the side of the prince and another
grotesquely hooded and swathed figure
which rocked unsteadily on a ponys
back a whimpering and a moaning
sounded from the muffling bandages of
linen dust coat which crowned the head
of this scarecrow

  the japanese-the japanese
prince min yung whispered in a shrill
voice straining with the ptilse of ex-
citement they have discovered his
majestys flight-they are after us-
after us

  a gagging querulous plaint issued
then from the wrapped mummy by the
princes side-from his majesty bugs
in proper person min yung answered
deferentially in the korean

   ah the emperor is beside himself
the prince said addressing us hurriedly
terror is turning his mind hurry
off we galloped pell-mell down the
thin ribbon of roadway for the yacht
six miles away-bethell on the left side
of his majesty the prince on the right
the latter was hampered by a great
chest wrapped in silk which he car-
ried under his arm nothing else wras
that than a treasure box therein flee-
ing royalty was taking with him all of
his crown jewels that were not already
in pawn

   on and on in silence the girl and i
riding together behind we heard the
wailing and the muffled pleading ac-
cents of the emperors voice punctuated
as the jolting of his mount jerkedthe
words from him the senile old man
 was crying like a child who is being
dragged to bed against his will

   we must have covered three miles in

the dark when something happened it
was all so sudden so outre that not
until many hours afterwtard could i
frame in my mind an ordered pro-
cession of the swift flux of incidents
we were passing a peasants hut i
heard a dogs sudden growl and the
rush of paws on the hard ground then
something sinuous and black shot up
from the side of the roadway plump
into the arms of emperor bugs i re-
member a cat screamed horribly at that
second

  but the scream of the cat was nothing
to the curdling yell which followed on
the instant it was the voice of the
emperor

  i crowded my horse over to where
he rode bethell and the prince closed
in simultaneously we saw a great
black cat clawing madly at his majestys
robes twining and twisting in the sad-
dle before him as it growled and spit
the emperor bugs his hands stretched
high above his head gasped gurgled
made insane duckings in his throat
the cloak had fallen from his face i
could see his eyes protruding like the
eyes of an idol

  it was bethell wrho shot out a hand
grasped the cat by the neck and hurled
it aside into the darkness even as
he did so the emperor of korea half
fell half slid from his saddle and once
on the ground began legging it back on
the road in the direction of seoul the
prince was pursuing him in an instant
then the rest of us whirled about and
galloped up the road after the two flying
figures we came upon the prince
gripping his majesty in a close grapple
and trying to interrupt a torrent of
high-pitched words which rattled and
clattered from the imperial lips his
majesty bugs was quite mad i am sure
of that he spluttered and chattered
and flailed his arms wildly about in an
effort to throw off the grip of the
prince the three of us-the girl
bethell and i--sat our horses in im-
potent amazement

  the cat-the cat min yung finally
managed to stammer his majesty
says the black cat leaping at him is an
omen he will return to seoul
the cat and the king



  i heard a little stifled moan from the
girl

  what bloody rot bethell put in
he cannot now he must go on to the
yacht

  the prince essayed to interrupt the
yammering old idiot in his arms we
could hear his voice pleading ex-
postulating but ever the emperor
raised his almost to a shriek crying him
down he actually fought and kicked
at his devoted captor five minutes
passed-five minutes while the empire
of korea was being blotted from the
nations of the world by one black cat
we sat helpless

  well put the old beggar on his
horse whether he likes it or not
bethell finally growled then off with
him to the boat

  i would have to kill you where you
stand bethell prince min yung said
quietly if you laid a violent hand on
the person of my ruler

  more minutes passed while the
prince argued fruitlessly i felt the
girl move her horse over near mine
and i reached out in the dark my arm
fell around her shoulder she leaned
weakly toward me my arm closed
tighter i felt her head on my shoulder
there it lay shaking under the rack
of sobs which would not be uttered

  it is the end of all prince min
yung said at last i ride back to seoul
and the palace with his majesty
silence for one long minute

  then we all do bethell said sink
or swim you know

  the girl lifted her head from my
shoulder and spoke brokenly

  no-i go to shanghai it is not-
that i am afraid but-but that i have
failed and that t would-yes i would
die rather than face the humiliation
hagiwaras na-nasty grin and-and-
oh you understand my friends

  but you do not know where the
yacht is anchored i babbled it is
three miles and more from here and
anyway albne on this road at night--
impossible

  i will find it-alone

  my head was in a whirl my heart
pounded so that i could hardly draw

breath suddenly resolution came to
me i dismounted and drew bethell
aside

  you will understand i stuttered in
his ear you will not think it cowardice
on my part if i-if i see this
thing through the girl-shanghai--
you-

  old chap-dear old chap-bethell
was wringing my hand-a gentleman
particularly a young gentleman who
would like a wife could do nothing
else not for a minute-no not a min-
ute-would i think you were running
away from the music and now god
bless you and be off

  the girl took the hand of bethell and
of prince min yung in turn and
nodded the good-by which she could not
speak his majesty who wras sniveling
quietly she ignored

  then we sat our horses for a minute
and watched three figures ride into
black dark back on the road to seoul-
to fate

  it was midnight the girl stood by
my side on the yacht as it rushed full
speed down the yellow han on the way
to the sea we were by the rail i
had dared to cover her hand with mine
and to press her arm against my side in
a little heartening comradely grip the
girl was weeping and she made no
show of concealing it at last she
raised her eyes all wtet to mine and
looked at me a long time

  to fail she said to be a man
and fail is hard-but for a woman-
ah-

  girl i murmured if a man can
share your failure-could always be by
to help if failure came again-would it
be worth-

  suddenly her sobs stopped i felt her
shoulders twitch then came a hyster-
ical peal of laughter

  but-to be-beaten by a cat-and a
black one-at that

  as to what befell the chief actcrs in
this little melodrama of ours history
has it thus

  on the night of november  not
two weeks after the events narrated in

the new national anthem

obert t small of atlanta georgia was listening to a conversation in
one of the clubs in his city about the power and importance of theodore
roosevelt in american politics the talk reminded him he said of a dispatch sent
out by an englishman who was working for the associated press in khartum
when roosevelt arrived there from his hunt in the african jungle

    the englishmans cablegram said among other things

     a party of american tourists greeted roosevelt by singing the new national anthem
     whats the matter with roosevelt nothing hes roosevelt

where jake drew the line

jake tannenbaum owns a theater in mobile furthermore he exer-
cises great care in his scrutiny of the bills any company wishes to present
in his house one morning he received from a celebrated shakespearean actor
the list of plays to be put on during a run of seven days

    i see here romeo and juliet  said jake running his finger down the
list and i will stand for that but i shrink when i think of that fellow play-
ing romeo and heres hamlet no living man can play hamlet as he should
be played and here is othello

    at this point mr tannenbaum leaped out of his chair and hung on the
ambient atmosphere a long and lingering groan

    it is too much he cried in anguish i am  fanatic i am not a crazy
man on the race question but im a son of a gun if im going to have in my
theater any black man handing out a lot of mushy talk to a white woman

 when thieves fall off

by charles e van loan
author of  the quartet horse poison jvo  etc

    playing the racing game in the alkali circuit how isaiah the star
    of the curry stable and probably the most erratic beast that ever
    drove an official starter to drink makes a bid for fame in
    a steeplechase an exciting and amusing story of the race track

old man curry said the hand
of providence was init which
was as accurate a guess as he
ever made in connection with
a horse racc it goes to show that a
man may be well posted on all the
prophets of israel and still not know
a great deal about the sport of kings
steeplechasing particularly provi-
dence might stand some sort of an out-
side chance in a dash over the flat with
everybody trying but over the sticks 
ne-ver the jumping riders settle
things before the race thus eliminating
providence and the mischance of jog-
ging to the post with the wrong ticket
in the bootleg it is only when the
riders fail to name the caucus nominee
that complications arise and old man
curry bless his simple honest heart
thought it was providence

  speaking from a professional angle
old man curry had about as much
business on a race track as a tender
squab at a third avenue banquet-
and almost as much of a chance in
the first place a man who can recite the
old testament backward and who
reads the psalms of david and the
song of solomon instead of the form
charts and the sporting pages is quite
apt to find himself outgeneraled by the
unregenerate in the matter of placing
race horses one-two-three at the wire
to make it worse old man curry
didnt have a horse in his barn worth
talking about with a straight face

  if an honest man hopes to win two-

hundred-dollar purses along the alkali
circuit there is only one way in the
world for him to do it-and that is
to get away flying and fly in front all
the way-so far in front that the wiz-
ened little tobacco-chewing burglars on
the other horses cannot catch him and
bump him over the fence but what
is a man to do who can neither outrun
nor outguess his competitors 

  old man curry had four horses-
elijah nehemiah king david and
isaiah-the bible class as the touts
called the curry stable

  elijah was a chunky short-coupled
thick-neckcd brute of a sorrel gelding
with two bad legs and a chronic weari-
ness which met him at the head of the
stretch

 nehemiah was a gaunt hungry-
looking aggravating sort of an equine
he rmit he could run fast enough to
suit anybody the only trouble being
that he insisted on running alone if
he happened to get away from the post
with the others he sulked and quit it
was only when he had been left flat-
footed that nehemiah came to life and
ran like a roseben-two hundred yards
behind the others he was absolutely
no good being too thin for soap fat

  king david was a stately chestnut
a confirmed stall walker a malingerer
from his yellow heart

  isaiah-well isaiah was the star of
the stable he was a tall big-boned
coal-black rascal about the size of a
dromedary as suspicious as a hawk


the popular magazine

and as savage as a wasp he was
probably the most erratic beast that
ever drove an official starter to drink
and sid the negro jockey who rode all
the prophets in old man currys stable
never knew when the barrier went up
whether isaiah was going up the track
down the track or over the side fence
the black scoundrel had been known to
do all three-in one race once in a
great while it pleased isaiah to behave
himself and run second or third in some
selling event but his appearances in
the money were rare

  there wasnt a breadwinner in the
stable nor anything which looked like
one and quite naturally old man
curry was a rank outsider-the last
man on the track to know when any-
thing was going on or coming off-a
nice respectable soft-spoken old gen-
tleman with white whiskers who ran
his bad horses to win and gave every
one else credit for trying no one
paid any attention to old man curry
and because he was harmless from an
owners point of view no one took
the trouble to explain matters to him

  if the judges at a small western
bush track had not seen fit to order
isaiah on the schooling list after two
atrocious performances at the barrier
old man curry would have had no
occasion to refer to the hand of provi-
dence horses which shy at the bar-
rier and refuse to break when the web-
bing flies up are put on the schooling
list and it is part of the duties of
the assistant starter to train these wild
creatures until they learn how to com-
port themselves at the post it was
after isaiah broke sidewise knocking
two real horses into the fence that the
judges sent for old man curry and
broke the news to him that isaiahs
entry would be refused until the ani-
mal had been schooled at the barrier
old man curry was innocent enough
to attempt an explanation but how
could he be expected to know that the
judges had ten dollars apiece on one
of the horses which isaiah put out of
the race

  the next morning clem newby the
assistant starter looked down from his

perch near the five-eighths pole upon
the usual bunch of two-year-olds and
one immense black horse writh a negro
upon his back isaiah looked all of
ten feet high among the colts and fillies
and clem newby who had a date with
the girl who waited on the table at
the bonton restaurant sighed as he
beheld the negros futile attempts to
control his mount a few feet away
from the starters platform old man
curry sat on the top rail of the fence
chewing a straw and meditating si-
lently

  heres that crazy son of a gun that
busted up the start for us the other
day said clem newby to butch flynn
butch with a blacksnake whip was aid-
ing newby from the track

  i see him said butch then he
went on to give his unbiased opinion
of isaiah his breeding his antecedents
and a few other things which occurred
to him as he warmed into his work

  mr starter said old man curry
gently i wisht you wouldnt cuss that
hoss of mine he aint ust to such lan-
guage an it aint fitten he should be
isaiahs right gentle when hes used
kindly

  s-a-a-jh demanded newby angrily
whos doing this if i was the judge
at this track ill promise you you
wouldnt start that black hound around
here no more he acted to me like he
wras full of hop the other day

  old man curry took the straw out
of his mouth but he changed his mind
and preserved silence

  now then bawled newby bring
that filly up on the outside easy
there come on with that chestnut
whatche think this is-a quadrille
you dinge where you try in to go
with that black camel  stand still with
him stand still i tell you no no
you cant break that way butch
bring up that chestnut steady now
youre off

  b-z-zip went the barrier and away
went the two-year-olds like frightened
snipe isaiah seemed to squat in his
tracks for the fraction of a second
then he whirled with a tremendous
snort like the blast of an auto horn
when thieves fall off



and ran the wrong way of the track
narrowly missing butch flynn in the
maneuver

  yes said newby with a sneer he
is a right gentle horse aint he as
gentle as a wild cat keep a-stickin
around here with him and hell kill
some of us yet

  mister said old man curry ear-
nestly i wisht you wouldnt abuse
isaiah like that whats the use to
cuss him hes a good hoss but he
cant seem to get the hang of that rub-
ber-rope dingus he aint used to it
it gets him fretted up and scares him
once he finds out it wont hurt him
none hell be all right back where he
comes from they start hosses with a
flag he dont know no other way

  well said butch flynn as he la-
bored with the heavr spring of the
starting machine far be it from me
to set my stack in at the wrong time
but you better take this isaiah back
where they start races with flags be-
cause if anything happens to me my
heirsll sue you for damages if i
hadnt been right there with that jim
corbett side-step isaiah would have
gone over me like a steam roller you
dont keep him hopped all the time do
you 

  that hoss dont know what a drug
is said old man curry hes only
nervous and scairt hell get ust to it
in time hes a smart hoss that isaiah
try him again

  newby tried him again the two-
year-olds broke as before and just as
the barrier rose butch flynn who be-
ljeved in experimenting upon refrac-
tory horseflesh curled the lash of his
blacksnake whip around isaiahs hams
the big fellow wheeled at right angles
and soared over the side fence pitch-
ing sid twenty feet into an alfalfa
patch it was not such a low fence
either but isaiah cleared it like a bird
on the wing and after separating him-
self from sidney he ran away switch-
ing his tail and snorting angrily

  goshamighty ejaculated old man
curry look what you did by hittin
him with that whip he clambered
down from the fence and started to-

ward the negro mumbling as he went
he aint ust to bein hit with a whip
isaiah aint it made him mad taint
no way to treat a high-keyed hoss did
he hurt you any sid 

  the negro rose and looked about
him grinning foolishly

  naw suh he said rubbing his
shoulder naw suh he didn hut me
none an he didn do me no good
nuther shook me up some id ought
to have stayed with him mist curry
an i certny would only he was lit
bit too sudden faw me i didnt know
whut he was aimin to do twell he done
gone done it yes suh hes a mighty
sudden hawss that isaiah too quick
a thinker faw me-yes suh

  hell think you into the morgue one
of these days if you keep on fooling
with him said newby as he climbed
back to his perch

  well sid said old man curry
go catch him up and take him back
to the barn his feelins are hurt and
hes all fretted up an excited from
bein hit with that whip hell have
to be cooled out take him back to
the barn

  sid departed rubbing his shoulder
and chuckling

  butch flynn was staring at isaiahs
hoofmarks upon the track

  heres where he took off said
butch and over yonder is where he
lit and hed have cleared that fence
if it had been twice that high suffer-
in salvator what a jump

  you did isaiah a wrong to hit him
with that whip said old man curry
patiently whippin a hoss aint no

way-

  say interrupted butch suddenly
has this horse ever been over the
jumps

  old man curry shook his head
how far can he run demanded
butch

  well said old man curry his
daddy was a four-mile champion
isaiah can go one mile two miles three
miles-makes no difference to him all
these races round here are too short
for him

  old man said butch earnestly


thb popular magazine

lemme tell you something make a
jumper out of this horse if hell take
hurdles the way he took that fence hell
win you a nice pot of money you
could take him to some track where
theyve got a steeplechase course and
clean up with him

   yes said newby maliciously and
they start jumping races with a flag
too

  old man curry removed his slouch
hat and mopped his forehead

   goshamighty  he said half to him-
self i never thought of that

  he ambled away toward the stables
with his head bent at a reflective angle
newby looked after him with a short
laugh

  whats on you butch he asked
are you framing up to get some jump-
ing jock killed or what

  ho said butch one of them
crooks more or less wouldnt matter
much but on the level bo did you
see the way that big brute sailed over
this fence  looked to me like he went
ten feet in the air why that bird
must have wings

   he better have said clem grimly
an use em to fly away from here
get those kids back and lets get
through some time to-day

   several months later the alkali cir-
cuit season ended butch flynn and
clem newby no longer track officials
found themselves wintering in califor-
nia and attempting to pick up a living
from the ground clem with a few
dollars in his pocket was giving a poor
imitation of a gentleman of leisure and

	independent means butch being finan-
cially straightened-embarrassed is
no word to convey the proper impres-
sion of butchs exceeding ruin-was
hustling as best he could

  hustling upon a race track is a
many-gided occupation including every-
thing in the world but real work

  part of the time butch assisted a
clocker who worked for a book-
maker and in this way came to have
some sort of a line on most of the
early-morning work-outs with the
knowledge thus secured butch set up

as a tout on a small scale operating
with one nervous eye on sig buetler
of the pinkerton patrol

  one afternoon flynn and newby met
on the promenade in front of the grand
stand

  who do you think is here asked
butch nobody but that old joker
and that isaiah bird and that aint
all he took my acivice and made a
jumper out of his horse

 him said newby scornfully
how come he to get on a real race
track with those lizards of his

  he didnt get stable room said
butch hes got em bedded down
outside somewhere from what he tells
me hes laying to put isaiah over on
em at a price

  newby chuckled

  daffy as a cuckoo bird he said
i suppose the old boy doesnt know
that some of the best jumpers in the
country are out here this season
molestar arabi prince wang and
that bunch a swell chance old isaiah
will have in that kind of company
wcl--  said butch judiciously a
jumpin race aint ever a cinch for any-
body-not even the best jumper that
ever lived too many things can hap-
pen and then the riders are always
doing business-framing up among
themselves you never know what
those burglars are going to do or which
horse they are going to shoo in id
hate to bet a jumping race-with coun-
terfeit money

  right-o assented newby those
jumping jocks are pretty tough propo-
sitions but then look at the chances
they take manought to be allowed to
steal something if he risks his neck to
do it which of em is going to ride
for the old sport

  not any said butch hes went
and made a steeplechase jock out of
the coon

  good night said newby with ex-
plosive emphasis why mcguire and
duffy and the rest of those mick riders
will murder him the first time around
the field

  that being the case said butch
its up to us to send flowers about
when thieves fall off



sunday week isaiah is entered for a
week from thursday he aint got a
thing to beat except prince wang and
arabi-the two best jumpers that ever
came west and the joke of it is
concluded butch the old man tells me
hes going to take the woolen string
off the roll and set in the checks on
isaiah-to beat prince wang and
arabi what do you know about
that

  a fool and his money gathers no
moss laughed newby

  even so said butch cheerfully
that wont keep me from ribbing up
some suckers to bet a few piasters on
isaiah-to come third

  if the coon lives that long said
newby

  of course said butch we got
to take chances on him getting broke
in two

  the grand stand overflowed on
thursday afternoon the steeplechase
being responsible for the added attend-
ance the balance of the days card
was given up to cheap selling races for
cheap horses and charlie com ford
outside man for one of the big book-
makers and turf philosopher in what
spare time he found stared hard at
the human swarm in the stand and
extracted the pith of the situation in
a few brisk sentences

  look at em up there said char-
lie and there wont be any rose-
bens runnin here to-day either
theyve all come out to see some ooor
devil of a jumpin jock break his neck
same proposition as a parachute leap
ive seen a million of em but i always
walk a mile to see another one because
im figuring that this may be the time
when the umbrella wont open we
aint half as civilized as we think we
are

  a steeplechase breaks up the monot-
ony of the daily racing card and fattens
the daily attendance but the bookmak-
ers and the professional gamblers have
small use for a jumping contest there
is never any real certainty of knowing
how the riders are betting and in a
long race over the sticks almost any

sort of a miracle may pass unques-
tioned by the judges

  there was once a man who figured
out fifty ways in which the best horse
in a race might be beaten and it was
a flat race he was using as the basis
of calculations in a steeplechase there
are five hundred ways in a flat race
when there is to be a shoo in it is
the owners who lay their heads to-
gether and make the arrangements in
a steeplechase the riders often assume
this responsibility therefore when the
jumpers are on their way to the post
the hardened gamblers sit in the stand
with  interest save in the spectacle
and the bookmakers handle what they
call the sucker money-tens twen-
ties and other small change and the
only bookmakers wrho will take a great
deal of any kind of money on a jump-
ing race are the ones who think they
know how the riders are going to bet

  down near the paddock in the jock-
eys room mr sidney albert johnson
slightly heavier than in the days of
the alkali circuit sat in a far corner
and eyed the other jumping riders with
furtive distrust he knew some of
them by reputation and was therefore
not reassured to any great extent
there was durable duffy so called
because it was said of him that in a
long and shady career he had broken
all the bones in his body save the ones
in his crooked spine there was
molly mcguire another steeplechase
rider of great reputation not exactly
unknown as a welterweight prize
fighter and corkscrew kelly just
out of the hospital after his last fall
walking with a slight limp but cursing
fluently they were a tough crowd
and mr sidney albert johnson did not
like their looks or the glances which
they shot in his direction some of
them spoke to him as he took his place
in line at the weighing machine

  little dark meat to-day said
duffy with a meaning smile

  about the third jump for his said
mcguire

  lemme tell you something mistah
johnson said corkscrew kelly if
you come anywhere near me ill spill


the popular magazine

you im from a state where we dont
like your kind of people

  sidney albert saddle and weight
pads on his arm weighed in silently
and faded away to his corner again his
eyes big with foreboding

   this aint no good place faw me
 he repeated over and over to himself
 no suh all shanty irish lawd
 you got to watch out faw lit sid to-
 day look like hes got into ba-a-ad
  company

   out in the paddock old man curry
led isaiah into his stall and stood quiet-
ly patting the big black horse on the
neck butch flynn unobtrusive as a
shadow drifted to the old mans side

  how about you said the tout
think youve got a chance 

  this hoss said old man curry
has always got a chance hes a right
nice hoss isaiah

  yes-but look what hes got to
beat argued flynn arabis six to
five in the ring and prince wang is
three to one they kind of stick out
in this company isaiahs twenty eight
and two think you can come third
with him

   somewhere a gong clanged and the
paddock announcer bawled

   saddling bell saddle up

   can he be third persisted butch
 he can be first if he wants to
 said old man curry with calm con-
 viction

   daffy as a cuckoo bird said butch
 to himself as he moved over to inspect
 prince wang now if i only knew
 which one theyre going to bet on to-

dy

ay-

   once more the gong clanged and a
flood of bright color burst from the
door of the jockeys room sidney al-
bert johnson conspicuous in canary
yellow and peacock blue was last in the
line his serious countenance in strong
contrast with his gaudy attire he
seemed gloomy and preoccupied and
there w-as an appealing look in his eyes
as he rolled them upon his employer

  sid said old man curry as he
gavejils tack its final inspection i
mightspoil some of them egyptians in

 the bettin ring to-day theyre layin
 too long a price against this hoss do
 the best you can with him

  yes suh said sidney albert with-
out enthusiasm ill be tryin mist
curry then after a short silence
but these irish jumpin jocks they--
they seem to took a notion agin me

  he climbed into the saddle set his
boots in the stirrups and looked about
him

  yes suh he repeated gloomily
they sort of took a distaste to me

  a bugle blared and there was a sud-
den stir in the paddock the horses be-
gan to move old man curry stood
looking after isaiah for several sec-
onds then straw in mouth he walked
slowly toward the betting ring

  there wrere seven horses in the race
-prince wang arabi blue peter
doctor boggs gondolier ugly joe and
isaiah arabi because of a sensational
performance the last time out was the
favorite backed from eight to five to
even money prince wang easily out-
classing all the others in the race wras
the strong second choice at three to one 
and blue peter doctor boggs gondo-
lier ugly joe and isaiah were quoted
at tempting odds the prices being am-
piy justified by information belief and
past endeavor there was no form
on isaiah but the information secured
by the bookmakers assistants did not
disconcert those suave individuals

  isaiah isaiah said phil hennes-
sey the ring plutocrat who set the pace
in the matter of opening prices first
time over the jumps oh well make
him fifteen to one till ve see how he
shapes up likes not he ought to be
fifty

  at fifteen to one there wras no de-
mand for isaiah so the price length-
ened to twenty and later a gentle old
man with white whiskers wfandered
through the betting ring sowing a crop
of crumpled five-dollar notes at odds
of one hundred to five no one paid
the slightest attention to him few re-
membered having seen him before
when he had accumulated a fat packet
of pasteboards the old man went down
when thieves fall off



by the fence and unshipped a battered
field glass

  by this time the seven jumpers had
reached the starting point opposite the
grand stand in the infield the steeple-
chase course stretching in a large figure
eight before them the starter with a
red flag was stationed some distance
in front of the horses and the assist-
ant starters armed with whips were
herding the nervous animals into some-
thing like a straight line arabi and
prince wang being seasonfed cam-
paigners and knowing what was ex-
pected of them stood perfectly still
refusing to waste their strength in wild
plunges and ineffectual dashes down
the course the hoarse voice of the
starter came faintly to the crowded
grand stand-a rumbling complaining
monologue

  no no i wont let you go that
way dugan you want me to fine
you dont talk back to me i aint
blind get that black horse into line
walk em up now thats it all
together come on

  a thou sand-voiced grunt burst from
the grand stand as the seven big horses
leaped into a lumbering gallop old
man curry leaning heavily upon the
fence took a fresh grip upon his straw
and sighed his relief it was as fair
a start as an honest owner could wish
to see

  when the red flag fell ugly joe
sprang to the front and rushed reck-
lessly at the first barrier jockey hen-
nessey cursed savagely and sawed at
the bit he might as well have argued
writh a thunderbolt duffy on arabi
was directly behind the crazy animal
and scenting calamity pulled sharply
to the right with a shrill yell of warn-
ing mcguire on prince wang also
sheered violently and the prince car-
romed into isaiah knocking the big
black horse out of his stride isaiah
promptly shuffled out of the pack and
dropped to the rear thrashing his tail
angrily

  them irishmen certny dont waste
no time thought sidney albert bit-
terly wherein he wronged duffy and
mcguire the bumping of isaiah had

been an accident and a fortunate one
it turned out to be else sidney albert
and isaiah would have been involved
in the smash which followed the
whole thing happened so quickly that
even the judges were not sure as to the
sequence of events

  ugly joe attempting the almost im-
possible feat of taking the first obstacle
without slackening speed sailed over
the barrier like a red streak but could
not hold his footing and crashed heav-
ily to the turf hennessey turned a
complete somersault and came to grass
in a sitting posture more surprised
than hurt doctor boggs next inside
shied took off short and jumping side-
wise collided with blue peter in mid-
air both horses went down and
corkscrew kelly and dugan joined
hennessey on the ground

  dugans collar bone was broken-
not a new experience for dugan-but
kelly rolling rapidly to the edge of the
track escaped without a scratch and
was able immediately to sit up and ex-
press an unexpurgated opinion of hen-
nesseys qualifications as a steeplechase
rider

  prince wtang and arabi went over
the jump neck and neck gondolier
blundered after them last of all came
isaiah feelings outraged temper
ruffled jerking his head from side to
side and snorting his protest sidney
albert spoke reassuringly to him and
the black horse cleared the jump hand-
ily and went  down the course fifty
yards behind gondolier

  ugly joe the wicked cause of all the
trouble scrambled to his feet and set
out after the others the empty stir-
rups banging at his sides doctor
boggs rose stiffly shivering as he hob-
bled away on three legs blue peter
never moved after lie struck the
ground thus in a single breath the
spectators had been given their glimpse
of turf tragedy-a crippled rider
groaning in the dirt three horses out
of the race two of them for all time
and far down the course went arabi
and prince wang neck and neck

  after a few heart palpitations a few
ejaculations a few sympathetic groans


the popular mflqflzine

 from the females present the specta-
 tors turned their eyes to the survivors
 there wereother jumps on the course
 other risks to be taken other chances
 for a spill comfords philosophy
 wasnt so far wrong after all few
 in the grand stand heard or under-
 stood the distant pop of the pistol
 which ended the career of doctor
 boggs

   ugly joe having furnished tragedy
  now essayed comedy the grand stand
 roared as he galloped past isaiah and
 ranged alongside gondolier in effect
 ugly joe seemed to say

   whats a rider more or less bet
you i can outrun you to the next
jump

  slim sweeney on gondolier
cursed heartily and aimed a cut at ugly
joe with his whip the riderless brute
dodged it and pressed closer at the
second jump he swerved into gondo-
lier and both horses fell sweeneys
nose plowing a furrow in the turf
that put another horse out of the run-
ning and isaiah seeing this accident
from afar had to be coaxed over the
second barrier

   come on big hoss urged sidney
albert pleadingly jump cautious
and we got third money cinched

   away out in front arabi and prince
 wang first and second money at their
 mercy were running close together
 eating up the course in long easy
 strides

   old man curry heard a voice in his
ear

   all you got to do said butch is
 to keep going and i win a show bet

   isaiahs owner shook his head discon-
 solately

  they rammed into my hoss at the
start he complained bumped him
clean outen his stride he knew that
wasnt right and its made him mad
fles awful sensitive isaiah is he
wont stand to be trifled with

   hed never do bettern third against
 jumpers like those in front said
 butch look at em out there id
 like to know what duffy and mcguire
 are talkin about wouldnt you they
 got it all fixed up between em

  as the leaders swung into the great
oval which marked the last circuit of 
the course duffy pulled arabi a bit
closer to prince wrang and opened a
conversation with mcguire

  come on molly he said ride that
horse out i got a good bet on him

 you what demanded mcguire
with suitable profanity quit your
kiddin why my folks are bettin on
youi

  for the fraction of a second the
boys eyed each other  amazement and
incredulity numbed all other sensa-
tions

  why faltered duffy i thought
it was the other way i thought-and
i got fifty bucks of my own on that
one

  thought-rats  snarled mcguire
didnt we fix it up night before last
you crossed me-for the price

  you lie almost screeched duffy
and i got a man from seattle bettin
a chunk you got to ride him out

  for a few seconds neither spoke
mcguires eyes wrere on the jump ahead
of them duffy stealing a glance at his
quondam accomplice surprised a flick-
ering light in his eye-a light which
kindled an immediate suspicion

  you ride that horse out or ill break
your neck screamed duffy

  ill break your seattle friend first
said mcguire ominously measuring the
approaching obstacle shrewdly

  the trick was most artistically done
but unless practice makes perfect of
what virtue is it from the distant
grand stand it seemed that prince
wang faltered in front of the barrier
and then blundered ever so slightly in
his leap a touch of the knee a shift
in the saddle-these were two things
which the grand stand overlooked as
did the judges mcguire acting his
part perfectly whirled through the air
struck upon his side rolled over once
and stretched out at full length limp
and apparently lifeless a coroner
might have been deceived by his atti-
tude but duffy was not deceived a
nasvy mocking laugh pursued him as
arabi thundered down the course alone

  cross me will you  murmured
when thieves fall off



mcguire go on now and cash my
ticket

  the crook panted duffy he
makes me lose a real bet and ive got
to ride this one for his money

  away in the rear sidney albert cast
a pair of wide eyes on jockey mcguire
still motionless in the grass men were
running toward him out in the mid-
dle of the track several roustabouts
were pursuing prince wang to remount
and ride him home for the short end of
the purse at the fence rail butch
flynn was pounding old man curry
on the back

  you run second he shouted all
down but nine set em up again 

  jockey duffy on the last half mile
with one more jump before him and
then nothing but the flat stretch to the
wire-jockey duffy huddled up on the
favorite-steamed with impotent rage
wrhat could he do nothing that
was the worst of it duffys financial
interest in the race was gone beyond re-
call his fiftv-dollar ticket wasnt
worth five cents nor were all the tick-
ets which the man from seattle was
to buy in the pool rooms downtown
gone-all gone and why  because
that thief of a mcguire got his wires
crossed and put down a piking little
bet on the wrong horse earnestly
jockey duffy consigned all the mc-
guires to everlasting flame

	im standin to cop five or six hun-
dred for my bit thought duffy and
that louse of a mcguire wont even
wait long enough to ask me will i split
with him he goes and does a brodie
for his petty-larceny bet oh why
didnt i beat him to it 

  i could have done it at that first
jump reflected duffy only i was
afraid of being jumped on by the
others why didnt i take a chance 
now i got to bring this one home-for
mcguire

  about here jockey duffys face grew
brick red over his shoulder he saw
prince wang still eluding pursuit and
the black horse and the black boy if
they could catch wang and the black
should fall-and why should duffy ob-
lige a petty larcenist like mcguire

these considerations whirled in duffys
brain there in front of him was the
last jump jockey duffy ducked his
head and stole a look behind him
four men were carrying mcguire from
the track toward the paddock

  stall you burglar thought duffy
ill give you something that will make
you sick now whats your ticket
worth 

  arabi rose lightly to the last barrier
and jockey duffy also a finished actor
rose with him-too far as arabis
hoofs struck turf again duffy pitched
forward upon the horses neck clung
desperately for a few seconds and then
slipped easily to the ground

  and i guess thatll hold you for a
while he said to himself go cash
your ticket now

  sidney albert johnson riding isaidh
cautiously with a prayer for each
jump heard the deep roar from the
grand stand which marked the conclud-
ing incident then he saw arabi with
empty saddle careening down the
course

  my lawd breathed sidney al-
bert come on you black hoss-for
all the money for all the money
put your feet to the ground and come
on

  for the first time in the race sidney
albert sat down on isaiah and began
to ride him

  old man yelled butch flynn you
win  yrou win

  old man curry swallowed his heart
when isaiah took the last jump in safe-
ty and through a mist which nearly
blinded him he saw sidney albert draw
his whip for a whirlwind finish the
grand stand yelled with laughter as the
lone black horse crossed the line ridden
out to the last inch

  a little later old man curry climbed
the steps to the judges stand three
gentlemen their faces set and stern de-
sired to question him later they
would interview duffy and mcguire

  mr curry said the presiding
judge a tall kentuckian of distin-
guished appearance and soldierly bear-
ing we didnt like the looks of that


the popular magazine

jumping race a little bit no suh so
we thought wed talk to you about it
mr curry did you-bet on your horse
to-day 

  why yes judge said isaiahs
owner slowly i bet quite some money
on him he put his hand into his
pocket and brought out a fistful of
tickets the judges glanced at them
hastily

  all to win i see said the ken-
tuckian  and to beat good horses
why 

  judge said old man curry ear-
nestly i bet to win because i thought
my isaiah horse had a right nice chance
to come home in front thats the only
reason i know hes a good hoss
judge and-

  certainly said the tall judge im-
patiently but doesnt it strike you as
suspicious that both the boys on the
short-priced horses should fall off to
let you win 

  yes piit in another judge wed
like to know what you think about
that

  what do i think repeated old
man curry turning his slouch hat in
his hands why gentlemen it looked
to me like the hand of providence

  the judges quite naturally took very
little stock in the hand-of-providence
theory so they sent for and examined
the bookmakers sheets on the jumping
race and what they found there led
them still deeper into darkness next
they sought information as to old man
currys record and the record of the
right nice horse isaiah and there they

found nothing to nourish their suspi-
cions then they cross-questioned sid-
ney albert johnson and found their
efforts vain and fruitless last of all
an assistant judge gave mcguire and
duffy a miserable half hour and re-
turned to the stand shaking his head
those scalawags case-hardened by ex-
perience fearing neither man nor his
brief authority stood pat and the
bookmakers sheets furnished no clew
to the mystery so far as duffy and
mcguire were concerned

  the tall judge summed up in short
sentences

  gentlemen said he we have ex-
amined the sheets from the betting
ring they show that mr curr- was
the only man who bet on isaiah to win
if these other owners were in cahoots
with him they would have hammered
that price to death if mcguire and
duffy had been betting on this long
shot we should have found the record
of it here no question but those two
rapscallions were up to something gen-
tlemen but what was it i give it

up

  i guess said one of the assistant
 judges with a grin the old man was
about right when he said it was the
hand of providence

  hm-m said the kentuckian
thoughtfully providence better not
mix up in any more jumping races at
this track or somebody will get him-
self ruled off for life

  the one thing the judges missed was
the bare-knuckle fight that evening be-
tween duffy and mcguire the ref-
eree said that it was a draw

the mysteriois mr wind

it was the coldest day arkansas had ever experienced in a little village in

	the northern part of the state an old colored man emerged from his shack
shortly after ten oclock in the morning he was weighed down with clothing
carrying at a conservative estimate about one hundred and ninety pounds of
wool and yarn including three coats two pairs of trousers and a double equip-
ment of socks so burdened was he by his wraps that he could hardly walk
just as he reached the street corner a fierce gust of wind hit his tottering form
and spun him half around

    as soon as he could get his breath he gasped out

    fore gawd wind where was you las august
the right bait

by william slavens mcnutt
author of  the princess of wachitabill hcenan postman etc

phil hammond wa one of a
great number of types of men
who should never have enlisted
in the army of searchers after
the mythical pot at the rainbows end
who invaded alaska in the years fol-
lowing the first newrs of the klondike
wealth

  he was a good boy phil was-arid
he was only a boy-but he was pitifully
unfit to sit in in the worlds greatest
gambling game the main trouble
with phil wras that he had too much to
lose

  for those who had tried in the ordi-
nary walks of life and failed for those
to whom hope wtas a reminiscence for
the strong in whom the wanderlust
was innate and whose adventurous
spirits were adroop with the general
humdrum of a normal orderly life in
an orderly civilized community-for
these alaska was a mecca and the
hazard of the game that was played on
its gaming board of icy mountains
treacherous rivers and desolate tundra
wastes with the lives of the players for
chips was as the wine of life to them

  it was to them what the field of battle
is to an ambitious soldier who has
drilled throughout years of a monot-
onous and inglorious peace they loved
the game for the game itself and they
won if they lost

  b

  phil had no love of the game for the
games sake the only emotion that
wild tales of the weird bitter hardships
of the new land stirred in him was
dread

  for this reason if for no other he
never should have gone for in a game
where the percentage is so overwhelm-
ingly against the player there must be
a reward in the joy of the mere playing
of it else to play at all is tragedy

  then phil made two fundamental
mistakes he took five thousand dollars
into the country with him-a consider-
able sum in that it wtas nearly all he
had-and he left a bride of a year be-
hind him ia their little five-room cot-
tage in waverley iowa

  she was a pretty demure strait-
laced little thing the daughter of a re-
tired farmer and she worshiped young
phil in an old-fashioned alice-ben-
bolt sort of a way that might wrell
have driven wiser men than he into
making far more foolish attempts to
accomplish things that would measure
up to the gigantic standard of such a
womans belief in the all-powrer of
whomsoever her love happens to mag-
nify to her

  for that is exactly why phil went
north he had a nice little business
and he was making a nice comfortable
living out of it but he was very young


the popular magazine

and very much in love and he hungered
mightily to be able to lay the contents of
the fabled pot at the tiny feet of the
misty-eyed warm-lipped wee goddess
who let him into heaven by the front
door every day at ten minutes past
twelve and ten past six

  extravagant rumors about the wealth
that yellowed the earth in the north
waiting to be gathered up by any one
who had the nerve and strength to go
into the land and brush off the snow
were rife at the time-and widely be-
lieved 

  phil believed them and throttling his
dread of the unknown and the bitter
ache that bit into the very core of his
heart at the mere thought of leaving
his wife and home sold out his busi-
ness and started north with five thou-
sand dollars to get a slice of the moon
for the little woman who believed that
he could reach up and pluck the sun
out of its course if he really and truly
wanted to she didnt want him to go
not a bit of it she cried and begged
worshiped him all the more for that
he did not yield to her entreaties and
then when he was gone she sat placidly
down and busied herself figuring out
what they would do with the millions
and millions that he would bring back
wasnt he phil hadnt he said he
would come back hadnt he said he
would come back rich  of course
and besides other people could see now
wthat she had known all along that
phil was really and truly a hero

  he was he suspected it himself
by the time he arrived at skagway he
was morally sure of it and after he had
negotiated chilkoot pass and the rapids
he was absolutely certain within
twenty-four hours after he reached
dawson city another suspicion that had
been steadily growing in his mind from
the time he had embarked on the north-
bound boat in seattle became a cer-
tainty  he was a fool

  some conception of the stunning huge-
ness of the country was his a little glim-
mer of the true proportion of the odds
against him the knowledge that every
likely foot of ground within a radius of
a hundred miles of dawson was staked

and that there were thousands of men
eagerly waiting the news of any new
strike ready and eager to stake their
lives in a rush to it on the chance that
it might be a bona-fide one and that they
might be one of the lucky few to make
a rich location

  pie had come as hundreds of others
had come-the ludicrous pity of it-
with the firm belief that once he got
into the country his fortune was made
he found himself in a place where
money was as plentiful as in wall
street and a good deal harder to get
it was too late to turn back or so the
dazed lonely disillusioned boy thought
so he got a job and stayed on buoyed
with a micawberish hope that something
would turn up a ludicrous and pathetic
figure in the human moil of the wild
raw camp

  so it came about that one day early
in june of the following year he sat on
an upturned box in a cabin on a creck
some fifteen miles from ophir with his
back to the open door staring with a
horrified hypnotic sort of expression at
a blue-barreled forty-five that he held in
his right hand just what would have
happened if his trancelike absorption in
the study of the gun had not been in-
terrupted is a matter of conjecture for
a voice from behind him broke the spell

  how son

  phil started up and turned toward
the door instinctively hiding the gun be-
hind him as he rose a huge-bodied
middle-aged man stood in the doorway
leaning forward slightly to balance the
pack on his back studying the startled
boy with a quizzical all-wise grin he
was a blond man with a wide heavy-
jawed face and small squinted blazing
blue eyes

  why-why hello i low dye do
hello how-how are you phil
stammered

  the big man chuckled silently and
wriggled out of his pack straps

  dont ye never do it son he said
as he swung his pack to the floor
things aint never that bad never
any old time ye get to thinkin that
the right bait



they are just you remember that they
aint

  young hammond flushed hotly
why-why what-what do you
mean he demanded

  thats all right son dont get
miffed i dont mean nothin im just
tellin ye that things aint never that bad
they can always get worse or get bet-
ter an yalways want to stick around
an see what happens

  phil hung his head i-i wasnt
going to do it you know he said
sheepishly

  sure ye wasnt the other agreed
heartily sure not heenans my
name bill heenan yet dinner yet 
no i-

  well les eat you get that fire goin
and ill show ye somethin worth lookin
at  i just come down from up nulato
way i got some potatoes off an up-
river boat up there some regular sure-
nougli potatoes hear me bet yaint
had none this spring have ye sure
not your bellys got the jimjams
thats whats ailin you man does get
that way you stoke a mess o them
spuds into ye an youll feel like some-
thin

  heenans assertive good humor wras
irresistible and by the time the meal
was cooked the lonely desperate boy
was laughing almost hysterically at his
rough jokes and quizzical badinage it
was the first bit of even temporary re-
lief from the sense of loss and utter
failure that he had had in the whole bit-
ter year for he had been obsessed to
the point of insanity writh his grief and
his moodiness had caused him to be
tabbed as uppish by every one and
severely let alone in consequence all
during the meal heenan through his
pretense of jocularity was studying the
boy keenly lie interested and attract-
ed the big fellow his boyish helpless-
ness stirred something of the paternal in
the rugged insolently self-reliant old-
timer after they had eaten he skill-
fully drew from the boy the whole
funny pathetic story

  -and so i worked there in daw-
son until this spring phil concluded
and then i came over here they said

the strike here was a very rich one and
i thought there might be an opportunity
for me to get hold of something it
took all i had made in the year working
over there to get my outfit and get over
here i still had my five thousand that
i brought with me when i came up here

but i-i- his voice quavered and

he winced and swallowed hard i
guess i was-pretty easy i hired a
man from clown in ophir to come up
here and tell me what he thought of this
ground he just went away this morn-
ing he says that there isnt anything
hereat all he says that the fellows
who sold it to me must have salted it

on me i guess i-i- gee  it hit

me kind of hard at first i thought i-
had it at last

  heenan grunted um they grab
ye for the whole roll did they

  phil nodded they got it all i
thought it was very rich here they
panned dirt from several places on the
claim and each pan ran from four to
five dollars they-they said they were
tired of the country and wanted to get

out right away i- gee i was

pretty easy all right

  we all fall  who were the guys
trimmed ye 

  there were two of them one of
them is a fellow they call doc adams
and the other ones name is bender 

  um doc adams and looloo ben-
der hey huh this jobs just about
their size

country like they said they was goin
to

no theyre still down at ophir
um what do you figure on doin
i dont know do you think theres
any chance of my going to law some-
how and--

  not a chance up here forget
it

  heenan sprawled back and smoked
long with closed eyes finally his face
crinkled in a slow grin and he sat up

  i reckon if ye had that little old five
thousan o yourn back in your pants
youd hit for home huh sure ye


the popular magazine

would you aint got no business

  phil fought hard to master his twitch-
ing face mr heenan he half blub-
bered i-i dont-i dont know

mister stuff i dont like it now im
goin on down to ophir i want ye to

mouth shut till i get this thing framed
right if nobody knows you know me
nobodys goin to try an pump ye about
what im pullin off see so when ye
see me around camp just pass me up
till i give ye the high sign

  a few minutes later heenan bade
good-by to a much bewildered but al-
most frantically happy and thankful boy
and trudged away down the bank of the
creek toward the camp at the bend
two hundred yards distant from the

shack he stopped for a moment and
looked back with a certain puzzled ex-
pression of inquiry in his eyes lifted
his hat and scratched his tousled yel-
low head perplexedly

  me-im plain boob he muttered
disgustedly i always did fall hard
for an onery well-meanin little mutt
like him dog-gone it

  he jammed his hat back on his head
petulantly sighed and started on

  when phil reached the camp on the
afternoon of the following day heenan
was there and also adams and bender
the anxiety of these two to get out of
the country had evidently subsided phil
met heenan in dutch louies place and
bill passed him without the slightest
flicker of recognition the next day
heenan was gone no one knew where
but he was freely gossiped about

  heenans clean im tellin ye phil
overheard a man in louies place de-
clare he tried to hook me for a
piece o change last night to sit in in a
darn little summer game that was run-
nin on the side here any old time bill
floats around tryin to make a touch for
a measly ten-specker to get into a little
twro-dollar limit game where they aint
fifty dollars in sight i reckon hes all
in aint he you bet he is i tell ye
he aint got the price of a drink on him

  he wont be short for a long while
another spoke up i know bill hes
got that old luck thing trained to come
a-runnin an eat out o his hand when
he whistles hell be there with the big
roll somehow when a lot of us in this
camp are bummin our eats at that i
aint seen heenan flat for a right long
time

  ah hes lucky all right but hell
never have nothin doc adams de-
clared hes got a weakness he falls
hard for the wheel an hes got a bug
for this system thing get a few drinks
into him an get him started playin
that system hes nut over an hell blow
the whole sack no matter how heavy
she is hell never have nothin

  hes short on keepin it all right
bender agreed but hes long on get-
tin it believe me scotty heres right
hes plumb lucky if hes out prospectin
thb right bit

ioi

-an i reckon he is-i wouldnt ask
nothin bettern to tag along an take my
chances with him im tellin ye hell
uncover somethin

  three days later heenan walked into
louies place called for a drink for the
house and paid for it in dust out of a
poke that lit on the bar with a very opu-
lent thud when he tossed it down then
he walked back to the roulette layout
and bought five hundred dollars worth
of chips looloo bender edged his way
through the crowd to doc adams

  i told ye so he whispered excited-
ly lies got somethin sure he has
he beat it out o here four days back
with nothin an now hes heeled right
we got to get busy and follow him up
when he goes out again i tell you hes
hit it

  the biggest boob in the place is wise
enough to know that adams retorted
disgustedly o course hes hit it but
were a year late on that follow-up idea
this whole camps just about thinkin
that same bright thought everybodyll
be on the move when he leaves

  he knows his way in the brush at
that it aint goin to be no dirty mor-
tal to follow him out if he dont wrant to
be trailed-an its a pipe he dont the
whole gangs hep but we might beat the
gate on em

  adams nodded its worth a play
keep near the door an well give it a
try

  adams was right within twenty
minutes after heenan bought and paid
for the first drink out of his well-filled
poke every one in the camp knew that
he had struck something and all were
figuring on a sure means of keeping him
in sight

  phil was among the crowd who
watched bill lose his five hundred on a
dozen spins of the wheel when hee-
nan lost his last chip he turned away and
started for the door on his way out
through the crowd he jostled against
phil and whispered quickly

  keep still an wait

  then he walked on out and the crowd
followed him hesitantly at first and with
a certain attempt at dissimulation but

as a jam formed at the door they threw
aside pretense and fought in a panicky
rush to get outside and keep heenan
in sight once outside they stopped
those who had gotten out first were
shouting to those behind to stop push-
ing

  he stops by dandys cabin down
there an flashes a gun some one out in
frout volunteered in explanation an
he says hes goin to wait there a piece of
a half an hour an the first guy makes
a play to get away from here ahead o
that time hell plug him thats what
he says an then he hikes off around
the corner o the cabin there i dont
know whether lies a-layin around back
o there waitin for some of us to make
a break or whether hes bluffed us all
out an made his get-away an i aint
aimin to try an find out neither

  the crowd murmured and threatened
and planned for fifteen minutes and by
the time they got up courage to make
an investigation en masse heenan was
gone and though they scoured the
brush in every direction for the next
five days no one found any trace of him
he had not filed on his claim at the re-
corders office so there was absolutely
nothing for the frantic crowd to go by

  hes stallki till he can get the tip
out to some friends o his from some-
wheres else scotty welsh complained
bitterly that aint right i hope
somebody turns up an jumps his darn
claim fore he gets a chance to file on it
serve him right

  on the evening of the sixth day after
his disappearance heenan walked
calmly into louies and ordered a drink
the men crowded around him and
talked volubly about everything in the
wrorld except the one thing that they
all wanted to talk about heenan took
a number of drinks and waxed loqua-
cious on every subject save the one they
wanted to hear him talk about

  look here heenan scotty blurted
out at length with a nervous laugh
aint no use o keeping up this stall no
longer were wise to you an youre
wise to us we all know youve hit
somethiti an we all know ye aint filed

  he lost the second thousand within
fifteen minutes while phil tried unsuc-
cessfully to catch his eye and convey
some sort of warning to him

  when the final bet that wiped out his
second thousand was lost heenan
squinted at the layout and scratched his
head perplexedly

  little bit shy he-admitted that

thought i sure had enough to follow

  adams caught him by the arm and
nodded toward the open door of a little
room in the rear of the place

up with ye bill ill stake ye all right

  heenan started to follow him raving
drunkenly that he was due and could
check-rack the place it was too much
for phil he rushed forward and
grabbed heenan by the arm

  dont heenan dont he begged
wildly hell cheat you out of every-
thing just like he did me youre drunk

mouth and he sprawled stunned on his
back on the floor ten feet away

  whos that fresh young squirt
heenan inquired angrily tellin me
im drunk  who is he 

  thats all right heenan hes just
a kid come on doc urged

  they entered the little room in the

rear and adams slammed the door shut
behind him phil rose from the floor
and sank into a chair by a table to bury
his head in his outflung arms in an
agony of utter despair the crowd
waited tensely eager one man voiced
the thought of all watch doc now
hell get the dope keep track o him

then stallinthe bunch like hes been

  a moment later adams stuck his
head out the door bender he called
come here

  bender hurried into the room and
the door was closed again ten minutes
later the two men came out together
their poker training was of little use to
them in their palpable attempt to mask
the exultation that was in them they
tried to walk to the front door casually
but before they were halfway to it they
broke and ran and the crowd ran after
them and so started a wild stampede
that has been described over many a
camp fire in the north when heenan
came out the barroom was empty save
for dutch louie behind the bar and
young hammond sprawled over the top
of a table with his head hugged tight
in his arms heenan surveyed the empty
room and laughed

  all gone dutch he inquired

  louie nodded it does beat all he
philosophized dreamily they stum-
bled over their own feet runnin after
it the more i see o people the more
i think sheep is four-legged humans 
heenan walked over to hammond
and dropped a leather poke on the table
infront of him

  sorry i had to bat ye in the month
son but i had to do it to make my play
good i told ye to keep still ye ought
to done it theres the money doc

a new definition of c o d

jlylr cohen was a bankrupt he had given the town of lancaster penn-
 sylvania a striking illustration of how to run a retail business on a grand
scale until the wholesale houses had demanded payment of him for what he
had bought he went to new york and entered the offices of the firm which
had been stung by his bankrupt activities

    throbbing with optimism he explained to mr oddenheim that he intended
to start a new business and wanted to buy a long line of goods mr odden-
heim stuck his head out of the door and yelled out abruptly

    at this mr cohen was greatly angered

that c o d does not reflect on your credit when i called out to isaac i

being another adventure of yorke norroy diplomatic agent

by george bronson-howard
author of lian enemy to society yorke norroyetc

a novelette

in the antechamber where yorke
norroy stood awaiting the appear-
ance of one talbot blake-a young
gentleman who fancied himself a
connoisseur of the arts and a man
about town-the most conspicuous dec-
orations were the photographs of pretty
women and pictures having to do with
the adventures of pink-coated hunts-
men they were hung together in a
mad jumble as if the owners imagina-
tion were divided confusedly between
the chase of wild beasts and the quest
of the unattainable she the secret
agent his keen eyes missing nothing
wondered idly how thoroughly the fel-
low distinguished between the two pur-
suits-if at all then he let his curiosity
stray to the costly knickknacks scat-
tered about and concerned himself
with whatever niceties of the mans
taste there were

  wealth he saw in abundance and
evidence of travel in the quantities of
booty from the bypaths of the world
but the few really choices pieces might
have been selected by the agent of a
public museum the man of taste in
norroy grew inwardly satirical at the
farcical result of clumsy money spend-
ing and he smiled but more than half
of the smile was satisfaction for
blakes benighted condition regarding
the real values in art would make nor-
roys access to the mans curio cases
simpler

  the secret agent had interrupted-
reluctantly and only because the call
was overdue-a bracing walk on a
february afternoon by a chat with one

of the subordinates he employed in his
prolonged war against the drug trust
a few whispered sentences from the
man and norroy was again sauntering
along fifth avenue his mind now bus-
ily searching for data concerning the
identity of talbot blake he could
not place the man in his acquaintance
and it had required the three minutes
that had just passed properly to con-
struct a mental image of blake from
his habitation

  the young man appeared at the door
of his bedroom the frown of inquiry
changing quickly to courtesy as he took
in the lean modishly clad figure before
him nonchalantly waiting to be ad-
dressed

 mr michael trask ventured
blake reading from the card norroy
had given his servant have we met
before i think n-

  the last word trailed into vagueness
as norroy moved his head noncommit-
tally silencing his questioner with a
half-persuasive half-peremptory smile
in a moment norroy had seated him-
self at blakes bidding and was hold-
ing the mans attention with his whim-
sical comments on the pictures his
penetrating little thrusts at art in gen-
eral his backward glances at the young
fellows foreign haunts given with the
authority of one who himself had trav-
eled at random to the four corners of
the earth

  and apropos of chinese art nor-
roy continued a pawnbroker to whom
i go occasionally for curios tells me
that you possess a certain jade piece--


the popular magazine

a plate of phenomenally deep green
carved with chinese ideographs the
only two buyers in new york whom
the fellow allowed to hear of that jade
were you-and myself we were
chosen because of the supposed length
of our purses i dare say at any rate i
arrived at the shop ten minutes too late
you had just gone oddly enough
the piece has a peculiar value to me-a
value of association luckily i have
the means just now to satisfy my fancy
i am happy to offer you double the
price you gave

  the offer was made with all nor-
roys quiet effectiveness part of which
was the finality of his tone and so com-
pletely had the secret agent assured
himself of this bargain that as he spoke
his eyes had wandered to the window
when they returned to blakes face
norroy was amazed to find a small
tempest at work in it the wrath grew
as blake digested his callers words
slowly and presently he was walking
about the room gesticulating violently

  am i never to hear the last of this
plate he cried i tell you no-no
for the twentieth time i bought the
plate because i wanted it and thats a
good reason for keeping it moreover
i dont want to get any more offers i
refuse to be badgered go back and

tell phil hurrish-

  hurrish norroy put in he was
looking at the man calmly amused at
the display and waiting for the word
that explained it

  yes of course-hurrish blake
stormed on youre the fifteenth man

hes sent to me if hes sent one-

  the fifteenth norroy leaned
back in his chair and laughed heartily
adding half to himself hurrish is a
busy man

 anyhow a dozen-and thats a
dozen too many blake raged mal-
treating a cigarette in his fingers until
he broke it first he came himself-
the brains of the drug trust and the
grasping fingers of it too with that
cold eye and his oily words-and of-
fered me half again what i paid why
he wants it i dont know and i dont
care then he sent his wife who hap-

pens to be my second cousin and she
begged for it on the ground of rela-
tionship just as if she hadnt side-
tracked me socially more than once
when she was after bigger game then
young phil appeared-the whole fam-
ily on the job you see-with his idiotic
monocle and he lisped out a request
i came near kicking him downstairs
then a raft of special agents pulled
my doorbell some disguised and some
not until im driven mad with simply
hanging on to the thing that i paid my
good money for and anyhow now
wouldnt i be a rare fool not to put
grappling hooks on a piece valuable
enough to raise a cloud of offers like

that you can see for yourself-

blake was growing restive under nor-
roys piercing gaze he caught his
breath his words coming slower

  if you hadnt looked like anything
in the world rather than a friend of

hurrish id- the sentence faded

of its own accord while norroy waited
patiently steadily

  if you have anything more to say
dont let me interrupt blakes visitor
was standing now his gloved hand on
his stick

  the young fellow shook his head
his eyes fixed on norroys expression-
less face

  then let me observe that i am not
a friend of hurrish said norroy
quietly at length i have never seen
him-i dare say i never shall as to
the jade plate the matter can-ah-
can wait i regret disturbing you if
the plates value should ever lessen to
you kindly consult my card as to my
address my offer is open indefinitely
afternoon

  norroy strolled out nonchalantly but
behind the keen eyes his mind had been
stung into life by the barriers raised
about the jade in the last ten minutes
he had gone to blake supposing that
the recovery of the plate was the affair
of an afternoon now he knew that
he must make new and well-laid plans
at once	

  he tapped his slender polished stick
against his leg as he threaded the fifth
avenue crowds before he realized it
the curio collector



he was in washington square and
evening had come a glance at his
watch and he was making his way
slowly westward toward an address in
greenwich village

ii

  three days later a heavy snowstorm
began at dawn to blanket new york
it besieged the door of a bright little
flower shop on east forty-eighth
street apparently enraged at the glow
of spring within since early morning
holly lea behind the crowded bril-
liant pots had watched the storm war-
ily not at all dismayed at the slack
business-indeed well content with it
the two customers who had heretofore
broken her peace found her listlessly
staring at a point in the snow behind
their backs she had made the sales
rapidly after a cursory glance at their
faces then retired to her post near the
window without a word

  it was now eleven oclock and for
the first time she frowned peering into
the snowstorm anxiously when a
muffled stamping occurred on the
threshold instantly she was at the
counter again her eyes on the door a
man entered and at sight of his face
framed in damp fur the muscles tight-
ened in the girls delicate wrists a
slight flush came to her cheek but in
her expression there was only the busi-
nesslike courtesy of the saleswoman

  to the girl talbot blake was the
arch type of that curious human new
york orchid drawings of whom are
spattered through the pages of the
comic weeklies and who is generally
to be seen leaving motors to enter fifth
avenue clubs he had twenty thou-
sand a year his occupation of spend-
ing it solely on himself gave him an
exotic distinction that is like none
other his tastes were numerous ex-
pensive and occasionally discriminat-
ing and certainly the folly he loved
dearest was the absorbing folly of
women these ideas rushed through
her head as the man appeared on the
threshold	

  evidences of other tastes however

she knew there wyere in his spacious
apartment over the way from the
flower shop-a leaning toward oriental
damasks a penchant for rare ivories a
veritable passion for chinese jade
which he incessantly indulged the
girl had kept a mental picture of this
apartment-of which she knew nothing
save the description-in her head
throughout the forenoon the appear-
ance of its owner intensified the vision

  that looks like japanese carved
ivory against the black coat she said
half to herself as she pinned in his
buttonhole the gardenia for which
blake had asked

  the man about town paused in the
act of regarding the flower and noted
the candid look in the eye across the
counter he liked it because it non-
plused him he was familiar with all
of the expressions in womens eyes
perhaps except the direct one

  carvings-you he stammered as
if a knowledge of the arts were an in-
decorous thing in a shopgirl he
checked himself and went on hurriedly
as she gave a slight nod have you
seen those in the granby collection-
the seventeenth-century jap pieces i
got two of em at their auction last

month would you-would- he

faltered again before hollys open eyes
with no change in candor a spark of
encouragement appeared in them she
leaned over the counter and spoke to
him as directly as she would have spo-
ken to her brother

  i love ivories and im particularly
fond of japanese workmanship

  would you like to see these
blake gave his invitation in a breath
the moment it was given holly leas
muscles relaxed behind the protecting
flowers she shifted her weight from
foot to foot

  when he queried to-morrow
for tea-for luncheon-for dinner this

evening- the invitations crowded

each other in haste toward the pres-
ent moment drawn by the cordial smile
that had appeared on the girls lips

  to-night if you like suggested the
smile

  to-night asked the man aloud


the popular magazine

  if you like she said tve seen
no ivories for months and i think
thats a great hardship very good of
you to be willing to show them you
know

 the man assured her of his delight
at her own pleasure in good things de-
posited a coin from his pocket and a
card from his case before a heap of
flowers and withdrew bowing once
more on the threshold

  the moment talbot blakes shadow
was out of sight the girl picked up a
telephone at her side and asked for a
number then eighteen thousand
and one madison mr norroy east
forty-eighth to-night eight-thirty
will call you if  need you hope i
shant thanks good-by

  that evening at five holly lea
turned over the meager receipts for the
day to the owner of the shop who ap-
peared suddenly out of the storm and
treated her with a respect he did not
often accord to employees quite pos-
sibly i may be back to-morrow she
said beaming at him if not ill send
a substitute i cant remember another
such satisfjing day as this has been-
my first glimpse of business life i
dont get that sort of thing at home
you know you were very good to
take me on mr abrahams what i
give you doesnt half represent what
i am getting in return good night
and she passed out with a froufrou
beneath her sober skirts that hinted at
the luxury of another life hidden be-
neath her plain outer garb

  the man gazed after her for a mo-
ment wants to learn business life
eh he mused willing to pay for
her experience too she must be a
suffragette

  at precisely half past eight that even-
ing ilolly lea alighted from a cab and
pressing a silver button in a marble
doorwayvacross the street from the
flower shop presently found herself
ascending in one breathless jump to-
ward the upper areas of the house

  a manservant unbolted the mirrored
cage losing himself in the shadows of
talbot blakes hall an instant after the
light revealed his face the girl paused

for a second her alert mind striving
to place the man she had just seen he
was vaguely familiar but the recollec-
tion shaded off into nothingness she
found herself staring into the face of
a trim maid still groping for the mans
identity she passed into a small cham-
ber and threw a shimmering evening
wrap from her shoulders

  the holly lea with the regal coif-
fure whose evening frock clung to her
young body in lines that could have
been achieved nowhere but under the
eye of one of the great modistes was a
different being from the raw girl of the
vaudevilles whose life had changed its
course after an evenings motor ride
with yorke norroy a few weeks be-
fore the inscrutable slim dandy had
achieved the metamorplibsis single-
handed his peculiar mind being as in-
terested in correcting a young girls use
of english as in warring against other
notions the seed of enthusiasm that
he had sown in her heart for the cap-
ture of the essential jade plates had
blossomed into outward maturity the
change was evident now in the deep-
ened glance of her eye the quickness
of her mind the poised alertness of her
body

  in a tiny flat downtown holly had
received daily news of norroys proj-
ects so that every detail of the chase
was imprinted in her mind save when
rehearsing for the devonshire maid
she had solitude -and careful attention
to her health had filled the wells of
energy within her to the brim

  to holly lea had come the six jade
plates containing the formula for mak-
ing shandoo the most seductive form
of opium unaware of their deadly
menace she had sold them and was
now eager to regain possession of them
so that norroy might destroy them
only one of the six plates had as yet
been found but a few days before
the secret agent had told the girl of
the whereabouts of number two

  he had given her two addresses-
that of the forty-eighth street flower
shop and of the residence of talbot
blake across the way the secret
agent had gone to the point crisply
the curio collector



tapping blakes name with a slender
masculine forefinger he had said

  this man procured the second of
the jade plates he bought it from a
seventh avenue pawnbroker who ob-
tained it from the man to whom you
sold the plates in october the second
dealer recognized pure jade and kept
it under cover until he could find a
rich buyer my men reached the shop
ten minutes after that buyer left-tal-
bot blake now ive discovered that
talbot blake is in the habit of pro-
curing a buttoniere from the florist-
abrahams-every morning a decent
chap blake but like most of his kind
too bored to be amused by anything ex-
cept a pretty and witty woman you
can- induce abrahams to take on a tem-
porary assistant i dare say you com-
prehend me 

  she had nodded too excited to
speak

  is your account with the bank suffi-
cient

  why i think so its my first i
dont know about cost or anything

  what about your own resourceful-
ness-your own strength of purpose
do you think that sufficient there
was a serious inquiry in the eye that
watched her

  for reply the girl had held out her
arm cool and steady with health a
discernible pulse beating calmly in the
blue-veined wrist

  my brain is working like that she
had said simply

  as holly stood moodily in blakes
anteroom she remembered how yorke
norroy had bent down and kissed one
tiny finger nail at her last words
youll do he had said in the mir-
ror before her holly could see the
flush of pleasure rise again to her
cheeks at the memory of his simple
transforming phrase

  she paused for a moment on the
threshold her beauty rare at any
time was refined by the mauve and
crimson mixture in her silk frock the
weave was an oriental audacity that
only the persian bazaar man from
whom yorke norroy had purchased it
long ago would have had to sell only

the celebrated designer to whom holly
had taken it would have dared to at-
tempt a frock of it he had looked
at the owner for the space of several
minutes before consenting it needed
youth to run the gamut of those dar-
ing dissonances of color youth to re-
enforce the deeper harmonies and
holly was at the edge of twenty

  each delicious curve in her white
arms and shoulders was evident now
against a dull and glowing background
with only a little expenditure of mon-
ey she had provided tourmaline and
chrysoprase-the cheapest of beautiful
gems-for her throat and hair a
golden mesh snake with hard green
eyes encircled a lithe waist of the sort
whose lines corsetieres imitate but do
not achieve and above all of its com-
plexity like stars above a seething
world were hollys candid eyes-the
eyes that had caused talbot blake to
turn and look at her again after she
had accepted his invitation to a tete-a-
tete

  her host connoisseur in women and
patron of the arts appeared out of the
dark she had not heard his footfall
over the soft carpet at full sight of
her he stopped and looked her over
keenly then he greeted her with a
quiet cordial smile holly entered a
high-ceilinged mahogany-boarded din-
ing room on his arm

  they were halfway through the fish
before either spoke save in gracious
commonplaces he inquired concern-
ing the fatigues of flower selling she
replied that flowers are beautiful and
that to be happy one must work she
touched on the delights of living among
the treasures of art he averred that
one must spend ones income somehow
but that there are other marvelous
things in the world than gems and old
armor she observed audaciously that
nothing gives so little trouble as inani-
mate things he retorted that trouble is
sometimes sweet it was the sort of
conversation one reads in books writ-
ten by young women

  the meal arrived it was roast
suckling pig with berried holly leaves
emerging from its backbone the girl
iio

the popular magazine

clapped her hands in delight she
plucked one of the leaves and thrust
it into her hair where its red berries
nodded at her host

  my only family crest she said
my first name is holly

  his answer was of the sort he had
found effective before the use of the
names of mythological goddesses as
similes saved efforts of imagination
so he compared her to aphrodite

  you mean the goddess who rose
from the sea she returned smiling
i never rose from the sea i rose
from the people thank you she
added as his eyes expressed unbelief
i have forgotten who i am to-
night but every day from eight to
five oclock i am one of them after
that the lizard changes its skin but it
is still the same lizard

  she knew she must satisfy his cu-
riosity with whatever scraps her in-
genuity could summon

  he was sipping his fourth glass of
champagne thirstily now confused but
delighted at the girls cleverness
warmed by the wine he at length be-
wail to put direct inquiries to her and
she replied with facts usually but facts
that revealed nothing he turned his
head to order a change in the dessert
and she calmly poured some of her
wine into a bowl of flowers which al-
ready held much of her former glasses
then shetoyed with a fruit glace and
waited smilingly for the end of the
dinner

  it came at last as a mound of jelly
was borne away unbroken save by an
idle jab or two from blakes spoon
the iridescent liqueurs that followed
remained a shining and undisturbed
company before hollys plate the
hosts attack on them had put a rosy
cloud between him and notice of the
girls abstemiousness

  and now he clapped his hands three
times loudly ask mrs parker for
the key to the curio cases he said to
the footman who appeared the mans
footfall behind hollys chair had been
so stealthy that she was startled

  the servant moved away as silently
and swiftly as he had come something

-perhaps a draft of cold air that had
entered the room with him-caused
holly to shiver slightly and as she
turned her head she caught sight of
the mans profile in a mirror as he
disappeared it wtas the fellow who
had let her in again the nameless
recollection troubled her mind and she
turned to talbot blake

  excellent servants these of yours
she said dare say it takes years to
train them

  not time m dear young lady
housekeeper mrs parker invaluable
woman good old tyrant mrs parker
got this man ony two days ago and
look what shes made of im

  the girls memory had been at work
as she bent her-head attentively toward
her host beneath the table she twirled
a ring on her finger around once incon-
clusively and then gave it a little pat
her mind at rest she had placed blakes
footman-he was an agent of philip
hurrish-hurrish of the infamous
drug trust who would move heaven
and earth to get the jade plates with
their formula for making shandoo

  his complexion subtly altered with
pigment the outline of his nose
changed by quills inserted in the nos-
tril his narrow head transformingly
shaved after the manner of french but-
lers beneath his disguise the servant
was undeniably the fellow who had
come to her flat in greenwich village
pretending to be an agent for the sup-
pliers of illumination under which pre-
text he had engaged her in conversa-
tion and later tried to bribe her into
telling something of the good fortune
that had so suddenly befallen her she
knew now that hurrishs money ex-
plained his presence in her apartment
that it was hurrish who had sent him
to enlist as blakes footman

  the man reentered the room holding
a gleaming brass key out to blake one
arm stretched over the table his
shifting eyes never once wandered to-
ward the girl his lean body suggested
automatic obedience he was the em-
bodiment of the crawling virtues of
the slave equipped with his masters
money for his masters purpose the

 resolute look in hollys eyes grew as
 she watched him leave the room it
 was for strife with such of hurrishs
 creatures as this that she had been
 training for weeks

   blake rose unsteadily from his chair
 and lifted his wineglass t the curio
 lady he cried face flushed and eyes
 swimming t the curio lady to
 all curios and all ladies

  suddenly he coughed supporting
 himself with one arm on the back of
 his chair slowly a change of color
 came over his weak but rather pleas-
 ant face the flush faded into white
 -the white became pale green he
 coughed again rinsed out his mouth
 with more champagne and turned sur-
 prised eyes on the girl controlling her-
 self with an effort the amazement in
 hollys face was as genuine as his own
 his distress was painful to see even
 in the moment of physical anguish she
 observed the habit of courtesy in him
 generations old

   somethin tastes odd he stam-
 mered dont balarmed bit dizzy
 thats all pray sit down all right

in a mo- a paroxysm of the

 throat interrupted and one of his hands
 passed wonderingly over a moist fore-
 head in another second he had fallen
 on the thick carpet inert and dumb

   holly leaned toward a silver button
 set into the cherry-wood boards at her
 hosts right hand her eyes roved over
 the table and before she touched the
 button the had found what they
 sought half immersed in blakes
 glassof champagne was the key to the
 curio cases where it had fallen from
 his hand she plucked out the cold
 brass and thrust it dripping into her
 dress as the wine was absorbed the
 silk turned a dull orange

  afterward holly remembered
dumbly watching the action of the
chemical and wondering if the poison
that had been used meant instant death 
then pressing the bell rather franti-
cally instead of the man who had
served their dinner the ratlike counte-
nance of the footman appeared at the
door for the first time his eyes went
directly to hollys she did not mis-

 take the menace in the look but for
 some reason his lips were still closed
 and the obedient curve in his back re-
 mained

  bring me an emetic of oil instant-
ly she said the note of command
growing in her voice as she watched
an odd enforced response in the mans
eyes by that look the girl knew that
he had not succeeded in getting rid of
the other servants in the rear of the
apartment as yet their presence in
the house meant danger for him and
quick work on her part he hesitated
a moment and holly took a step for-
ward the mans gaze went involun-
tarily from her uplifted arm toa huge
lacquered gong toward which the girl
had chanced to move holly under-
stood that it was the housekeepers bell

  if you do not return with restora-
tives iri three minutes i shall call mrs
parker she said deliberately survey-
ing the gongr you will understand
that it is better for both of us that i
do not have to ring her bell before
she could add a word he was gone
from the room

 she was free now to crouch by
blakes side her ear at his heart his
respiration was slow and faint

  her lips compressed and her eyes
averted from the deathly pallor of the
mans face holly seized his shoulders
the muscles stood out like whipcords
in her slender back but she was able
to seat the man in his chair at the
second straining effort then she
propped up an arm shielding his face
with one of his hands flecked the dust
from his clothes and rearranged his
crushed buttoniere

  to one oil the other side of the room
talbot blake would have appeared to
be merely absorbed in contemplating
his own shoes his slow regular
breathing had reassured the girl and
she dampened his brow with some cool
wine she carried a strengthening
touch ofit to her own lips and looked
swiftly about her

  a moment or two more and i shall
be finished here she calculated rap-
idly blake can wait that long for
attention he must wait


the popular magazine

  she had gone to the row of curio
cases deep in the shadow of the op-
posite wall the gloom of a great rug
shrouded them a red bokhara sus-
pended at an angle from the wall on
copper rods fixed in the plaster even
in the crisis her mind was occupied
with the mishaps to incidental pawns
in the game such as blake twice be-
fore turning the key in the lock she
glanced back to see if he stirred there
was  movement she drove him from
her mind and peered into the depths
of the largest case

  back of the medley of crystal and
glass holly could see faintly a green
disk but she was not sure of its iden-
tity she searched for an electric
switch and found nothing but a match
in its sputtering flare she made out the
unmistakable cuneiform characters in
the face of the jade for the moment
it looked beautiful enough to be worth
the lives that it and its mates had cost
at last she had the key in the lock
and was turning it

  it resisted the girls arms became
tense with the effort to turn it she
paused in the struggle and glanced
back of her in fright half expecting
to feel the enemys fingers on her throat
in the very second of victory the
room was as still as the motionless
body of the man in the chair a minute
flame in a silver candlestick at talbot
blakes elbow went out at that mo-
ment  holly noted that the flickering
shadow had given his profile a curious-
ly alive look that was now gone she
bent her head over her work-mad sud-
denly to get away from the ominous
room

  it became increasingly plain that
something was wrong she thrust the
key back and forth in the opening nicks
up and then down nothing came of
it but wrenched and aching fingers
she tried to shatter the glass it was
as thick and unyielding as a gravestone
then she rested her temples o the sil-
ver edge of the case for a moment
whatever fear there had been in her
heart gone she was balked but her
will responded to the new call upon it
like a steel spring

  of course the footman had substi-
tuted another key for the one mrs
parker had committed to his care
there had been plenty of time to make
the exchange she hated herself for
underestimating his wits so badly as
blake had his honesty

  holly glanced at the clock ages of
intense activity had been packed into
just three minutes of time she knew
that the sinister servant might return
the next second or in half an hour-
with or without restoratives for blake
depending on how far his fear of the
other servants in the house forced him
into obedience to her word the en-
tire affair was balanced on a razor edge
tipping toward failure

  holly had gone to the telephone in-
strument at the other side of the room
she was giving the operator yorke
norroys number

  a vision of entering norroys apart-
ment the jade plate securely tucked
under her arm and victory in her eyes
was blotted out it had sustained her
for weeks she held the receiver in a
vise her eyes black with disappoint-
ment the keen satisfied look with
which norroy had rewarded her apt-
ness during the weeks of preparation
would leave his face she already hated
the patient encouragement that would
replace it

  and yet holly knew that to stay in
the struggle without help at this point
would be to double the chances of fail-
ure only the day before norroy had
reminded her that mere pride in his
own strength has lost many a good
warrior his battle the recovery of the
jade was the important thing not her
own prowess she crushed back her
conceit as she heard norroys voice on
the wire

  i need you at once she said
briefly

  norroy closed the connection with a
syllable of assent

  in another moment she had gone to
the tiny dressing room after her cloak
and was back in the room hooded in it
as she slipped into the shadows behind
the bokhara rug she noted that the
deep green of her cloak was the exact
thb cucrio collector

h

shade of talbot blakes ivy-colored
wall

   for a succession of little eternities
she waited one by one the lights in
the candelabra before blake died the
sft glow of electricity in the ceiling
above him seemed to sink in company
with them then flare out again holly
saw each object before her shrink and
swell change in color and form as
her tired eyes played pranks on her
the bent figure of her host remained
still among them all an immobility that
was at times more terrifying than the
wildest action now his body seemed
the home of a brooding will that
reached invisible hands over thfe room
and made the chairs dance again he
was passive and defenseless and all
his rioting possessions threatened to
topple in upon him in a huge con-
spiracy

  holly pressed her temples and smiled
at herself she knew that her brain
was ready to work coolly and steadily
the moment it was needed the un-
stable room amused her

  the last lighted candle on the table
spluttered and fell over on the white
damask and the smoking ring slowly
widened the girl sniffed the acrid
smoke idly uncaringly she would as
soon have ventured out of her hiding
place to stop the smudge as to dust the
furniture or to powder her nose the
crawling burn ended presently at a
border of champagne stains in the cloth
at that moment a chime in one of the
front drawing-rooms struck eleven
oclock as if prompted by the vibra-
tions the hand that had supported tal-
bot blakes head fell suddenly and his
body swayed slowly forward and in
a moment he was still again his head
quite simply buried in the crook of
one elbow his position more natural
than before hollys lips curved at the
grotesque pantomime

  the door from the butlers pantry
opened quickly and noiselessly in-
stantly the room that had been reeling
before hollys eyes settled to rights
each chair on four legs  every line
straight and clear her brain registered
every movement that the footman made
b

-with startling accuracy he had
paused at the threshold peering with
the furtive slyness of an animal into
every corner of the room his eye fell
on talbot blakes head left it to search
for something else and returned to the
still figure for minutes he stood there
assuring himself before he entered the
room that it held nothing he need fear
ready to move back into the dark at any
moment holly never forgot the rab-
bitlike precautions of hurrishs back-
stairs ambassador

  presently he was at the side of the
master of the house testing his pulse
opening his closed lids evidently he
read in the pupils of blakes eyes that
he could count on a further period of
torpor for he let the body fall back
with a sudden movement of unconcern
and an odd ruthless twist on his face
then with rapid soft steps he left the
room by the hall door

  by no chance had holly dropped a
long white glove at the entrance of the
anteroom one of its crumpled fingers
pointing toward the outer entrance
she had left it lying on the carpet when
she returned with her cloak hoping
the servant would not overlook the
mute index finger pointing toward her
own departure he did not for he
was back in the room presently the
scented kid flung over one arm his
face twitching with satisfaction he
flung it on the table and reached for
the sherry bottle on the sideboard each
gesture free now and with no attempt
at silence

  there was a rapid noisy gulping of
wine a hearty wiping of his unpleas-
ant crooked mouth and he had slipped
two fingers into his vest pocket and
drawn forth a brass key-the real key
then he was at her side almost-al-
most within sound of her own heart-
beats his hand on the lock of the curio
case

  even a slight blow will convulse a
certain small vulnerable spot in the
human wrist near the base of the
thumb as quickly as fire sears the cuti-
cle hollys fist came down with a
smart impact the falling key struck
the edge of the case and rebounded


the popular magazine

close to the hem of her skirt the man-
stepped back with a snarl of mortal
terror revealing a quaking soul whih
no amount of swagger could ever en-
tirely cover holly put one foot over
the key sweeping it beneath her dress
and glanced up at the shaking man with
a faint smile  her lips

  even in his moments of self-control
the fellows bluster would have been
blunted against the steely composure
with which the girl met him he was
helpless for many moments the girl
waited

  youve learned some tricks since i
saw you last holly lea he said at
length been working hard at the
game 

  just hard enough to realize the
value of this key my dear sir i hope
you dont want me to return it she
ventured pleasantly

  im going to grab anything i can
get he said glibly his assurance re-
turning a little at the sound of his own
voice specially anything i can get
as easy as that key you wouldnt do
anything worse than scratch my face
with those pretty pink nails of yours
would you you keep em filed nice
and sharp now eh-sharper than when
you were dancing in the cheap houses
on the circuit need em in your busi-
ness 

  they are quite as sharp i assure
you she returned a little viciously
i must be ready for emergencies but
i shant use them to-night youre not
going to require scratching

  no well i dont really believe
that you get me kid he said slowly
his bloodless skin wrinkling as he
smiled his eyes watching the white
hands that hung limp at her side then
his fingers twitched toward a rear
pocket and she caught the gleam of a
revolver in the air

  step off that key and step quick
he was shouting now make believe
i was the stage manager at yer first try-
out ill give you three seconds and a
half

  holly was unarmed she had been
waiting for his movement toward the
pistol she suspected he carried wrhen

it came she did as she was told leaving
the key gleaming on the floor between
them the agent bent toward it his
nasal voice growing shrill with his tri-
umph as he told her what to do

  now you can wait until i look at
this brickybrac in the light before i
make up my mind its the right one
he said wouldnt like to make a mis-
take in the dark then ive got a friend
outside wholl take care of - you young
one hell wall you up in a pretty
boudoir where you will have plenty of
chance to practice your new songs all
alone ill get im on the phone in a
second meanwhile just step over by
the wall and try to look as if you was
enjoying the party he waved his gun
toward her

  the girl obeyed him impassively
she moved with a quaint dignity her
skirts delicately rustling her cheeks
faintly flushed her eyes and mouth
calm hollys dramatic sense was at
work she was back in the days when
she played her little games on the
boards when she knew that her slight-
est gesture must register in hundreds
of idle minds when she was playing
for applause instead of for life and
death it all helped her to time each
movement in the grim little ordeal as
delicately as if nothing hung in the bal-
ance but her salary the man showed
the effects of her composure by grunt-
ing amiably at her docility as he fum-
bled with the lock he made a wry
mouth in her direction which he meant
for a kiss but his right hand kept her
securely covered with the revolver in
another moment he had thrust the little
green plate into his pocket

  a shrill peal of laughter into which
holly put all the discords in her flex-
ible voice stopped him before he had
moved from the case the girl kept
her eyes upon the weapon which she
half expected would be fired instantly
but the lackeys nerves refused some-
how in the crucial moment instead he
wheeled round upon her outburst with
an oath he found holly standing
against the wall one hand clutching the
rope of the chinese gong-the house-
keepers bell
the curio collector



  its all up she said up-em-
phatically and finally up did you think
you could win with a little loud talk
and an empty threat throw that
weapon out of the window and put
that plate into my hand or ill ring
this bell the housekeepers just above
mr blake neednt have bothered to tell
me i knew it by the quiet way you
moved about-your gumshoe step-
isnt that the word  ive forgotten
most of my vaudeville slang

  a deluge of talk followed with a
sure hard ring in the girls voice that
baffled the man he gazed at her
dumbly his slower mind seeking an
outlet she fired her mockery at him
in volleys holding him with the sure-
ness the bravery of it holly had un-
derstood in her cradle how to over-
whelm more difficult material than such
an opponent she let loose more talent
than he was worth in the joy of the
task fixing him with burning eyes she
all but tossed the rope from her in
abandon daring him to fire

  slowly he yielded as a raven might
yield to a snake when he had low-
ered the hand that held the pistol and
thrust forward one shuffling foot holly
knew that she had triumphed a dozen
times after that he hesitated his eyes
turned yearningly first toward the door
then down to his weapon but at each
convulsive half raising of the pistol a
sharp word from the girl held him
back and her bright hypnotic eyes
drew his to the fingers that clutched
the bell rope presently he was before
her the plate in his lax fingers she
had taken it and thrust it into her
bodice in a second while the man stood
before her still in grotesque inaction
apparently as bereft of energy as the
deadened body in the chair behind him

  youve got me this time he mut-
tered his eyes roving over the carpet
if id known you was a professional
a reglar dyed-iq-the-wool first-rater
id never undertook the job wasnt
on to you at first-you looked so pretty
and meek

  holly laughed acting unlike a
thief is rather the thing for a first-
rater to do isnt it she said did

  you expect me to glower and mutter
curses  they may do that in the lower
walks of the profession-i dont know
doubtless you could tell me im fairly
new in the business-

  not so new but that youve got next
to some of the trade secrets mighty
quick young lady he put in some
of the things only the wise ones know
about that there jade plate for in-
stance-	t

  ah yes the jade plate she inter-
rupted my present engagement in
your profession ends now that i have
it about me  shall be quite finished
as soon as you have laid aside your pis-
tol-up there on the mantel out of our
way i want you to help me do what
we can for mr blake before i go

  the fellows gaze followed the slight
nod of her head toward the man in the
chair it- was the first time his eyes
had wandered from the cool command
of her scrutiny-the hasty poise that
lay beneath her bantering for a sec-
ond she was not sure that he would
obey but with a cutting little word
she called iris attention to the bell rope
which had been lying loose in her fin-
gers and which she now drew danger-
ously taut he looked at the ominous
thick cord for a moment wavering
then he slunk away rapidly toward the
mantel

  the footman brushed the sleeve of
talbot blake as he passed his masters
chair and the limp arm clung to him
startled he turned and looked into the
face of the man he had drugged
blakes eyes were open the confused
shadows in them were fading before
a look of inquiry the dumb ques-
tion became a mutter and in a mo-
ment more blake had half raised him-
self and was demanding of his servant
an explanation of the disordered ta-
ble the weapon in the mans hand his
own condition

  i was doped-doped wasnt i he
said repeating the words over and over
so that they might sink into his own
clouded brain he glanced down at
the cloth drenched with champagne
and added whimsically must have
cost me a good deal in wine bills while


the popular magazine

i was asleep then his humor chang-
ing in a flash to anger he shouted
loudly twice who did it

  the footman had watched the re-
covery narrowly his beady eyes trac-
ing every evidence of returning control
on his masters face his hand now and
then carelessly exhibiting the little pis-
tol that he carried the necessity for
any personal courage on his part was
going with every second and as the
opportunity to use his natural guile
dawned upon him his eyes grew bright
with excitement his tongue wagged
glibly directly his masters straggling
sentences were finished

  i tried to save you from her sir
he cried i did what i could-indeed
i did but i got into the room too
late she had done her work already
and you was lying there in your chair
as white as a sheet i didnt have time
to do anything for you then because
she was over at the cases taking some-
thing out i think its a little green
plate-jade she called it-and if you
want it back you can find it inside her
dress i had to use this pistol to keep
her from going away with it i hope
she hasnt made you feel too bad sir
you wouldnt think that a young wom-
an that looks as nice and innocent as
she does would have poison on her sir
but it looks as though this one had gone
clean wrong afraid she has sir-
afraid-

  hold your tongue baker called
out blake peremptorily growing tired
of the mans loquacity ill attend to
the young lady myself he turned
heavily in his chair looking as keenly
as his reeling head would permit at
holly as she leaned against the wall
still clutching the bell rope the girl
was a little white but the eyes she
turned to blake were calm and un-
wavering

  sorry but it looks bad for you
he said a girl doesnt find oriental
silks in a flower shop nor learn to
speak the kings english as you do
there you know wouldnt have mind-
ed your taking a curio perhaps but i
do object to being drugged i dare say

i	was an ass not to have been wiser

in the beginning have to ask you
for whatever valuables of mine you
have about you

  the clubman looked pained at the
necessity of the moment but he clung
to his idea and instead of meeting
the girls eyes he turned an unrespon-
sive shoulder when holly made an im-
petuous step forward

  you were drugged by your own
servant she said quietly i found
him rifling your curio cases with a re-
volver in one hand and i had my hand
on this bell to ring for the housekeeper
when you opened your eyes

  blake hesitated moved a trifle by
the quiet authority of her manner but
still filled with doubt he paused for
seconds turning the matter over in his
mind then a decision came to him
writh difficulty he left his chair and
wralked unsteadily toward the bell cord
that holly had just left three vibrant
peals of the great gong were sounded
and the man sank weakly again into his
seat

  mrs parker arrived in a few mo-
ments a bustling imperial matron in
black silk with sleepy eyes innocent of
the dramatic goings-on that had taken
place in the room below her energy
came to her in a wave however as she
beheld the havoc on the stained and
singed tablecloth and it grew into an
irritable sympathy when the pallor of
her masters face was borne in upon
her

  i knew it she cried entertain-
ing a strange young woman with a din-
ner fit for a queen and her coming
from a flower shop and dressed like a
grand-opera singer i tell you again
mr talbot no good comes of making
friends too easy if anything terrible
has happened maybe youll take old
parkers advice next time and here

--your best damask burned- the

old woman rattled on with the volubil-
ity natural to her who had given tal-
bot blake his first knickerbockers to
wear and who now ruled his household
with a rod of iron-a rod which she
apparently thrust into his personal af-
fairs on occasion without reproof she
began to straighten the table fussily
the curio collector



 darting hostile glances at the other
 woman in the room

   blake indicated holly with a jerk of
 his head this young lady may have
 some of my belongings on her-or she
 may not he said i want you to find
 out here and now parker and mean-
 while do stop your chatter you go
 on as if you had never found me in a
 mess before i should think you would
 get tired of being shocked

   it was something like ferocity that
 the old woman exhibited to holly now
 that even her master had laid the girl
 under suspicion the clubman checked
 her enmity with an admonishing word
 as she approached the silent young
 woman bristling before the house-
 keeper reached her however holly
 took a step backward and in a second
 she had drawn a small green object
 from her bodice holding it for a mo-
 ment between the gleaming triumphant
  eyes of blakes footman and the misty
 blue ones of the clubman himself both
 men held their breath as she deposited
 it on the table before them

   there is your precious jade she
 said with a quiet smile at blake out
 of which not a particle of her steely
 sporting quality had gone i took it
 from your thieving footman to save it
 from-well from worse uses than you
 will guess and by the way she add-
 ed with an emphatic little nod toward
 blake that he remembered long after-
 ward it is going to surprise you some
 day-surprise you awfully-to learn
 that what i say is true

   the clubman wiped his moist brow
 in a mirror opposite he caught the re-
 flection of his own face in which per-
 plexity was deepening with returning
 pallor mrs parker had left the room
 suddenly reproachful i told you sos
 written large over her perspiring fea-
 tures and her broad and panting bosom
 it was baker the furtive-eyed servant
 who took first advantage of the girls
 confession his importance swelled
 by the removal of guilt from himself
 suggested instant rebuke to the woman
 who had outwitted him until now and
 as holly stepped backward toward the
 support of the wall his hand fell heav-

 ily on her bare arm instantly she gave
 an exclamation of surprised disgust
 that echoed sharply through the still
 room and in the hall behind her

  no easy get-away for you young
madam the fellow said his clammy
fingers pressing into her flesh

  blake had turned to order him away
even mrs parker from the hall behind
gave a little sound of protest but be-
fore either could speak the mans hand
suddenly left hollys arm as a leather
belt flies from the wheel that holds it
taut his body went spinning a few
yards dizzily and collapsed into a heap
on the carpet while the stranger who
hurled him away lowered his arm and
stood quite still in the doorway inclin-
ing his head politely toward the master
of the house

  the light fell full on the newcomers
face revealing a dark olive skin like
a brazilians a sparse curling beard
and hair that in spite of a recent clip-
ping still waved fractiously impec-
cable evening clothes covered a full
body bordering on obesity-a body that
responded flexibly however to the
mans swiftly working mind gold-
bowed spectacles part of the usual
equipment of a physician the man wore
lose to his eyes concealing their
color

  he did not speak until mrs parker
who had just let him in at the front
door began to help him out of the
snow-dotted fur that covered him

  you called for a physician i
think 

  blake did not answer and holly in-
formed the clubman quickly i tele-
phoned for a doctor an hour ago when
you were still in a stupor then she
added with a slow smile at the new-
comer  thank you

  no trouble he returned your
voice sounded a trifle-alarmed

  holly had given him no look of rec-
ognition but her beating pulses calmed
at the sound of the flexible voice a
trifle deeper than usual--the voice she
had grown to associate with the mas-
tery of a hundred difficult situations
the burden of the tense scene was lift-
ed from her spirit a delicious sense of


the popular magazine 

security went over her nerves she
sank into a chair the only outward sign
of relief being a slight flush that rose
to cheeks which had grown pale dur-
ing the long strain

  norroy moved swiftly intent on his
patient again and strongly holly
caught the impression of powerful
forces held in iron control beneath his
careless exterior she watched him
bend over his black satchel and extract
a stimulant that the weakening blake
seemed to need he administered the
cordial with the nonchalance of a pro-
fessional meanwhile directing mrs
parker in her hurryings to and from
the kitchen with cloths and hot water

  presently the slender fingers ceased
mixing potions and in a twinkling the
physician became a gentleman of lei-
sure he had brought up blakes vi-
tality notch by notch until the clubman
smiled his thanks to him norroy took
a chair opposite his patient extracted
a thin crested cigarette from his gold
case and thumped it softly on his cuff

  my dear sir he said let me con-
gratulate you on the moderation of the
dose a little more of that particular
poison and i should not have had the
happiness to bring you through an
accident i presume

  in a few minutes blake had told the
tale as he knew it punctuated volubly
here and there by mrs parker from
the background norroy listened at-
tentively without comment then he
examined the little green disk at his
side carefully

  a charming specimen he said
meditatively at length in the land it
came from it would be held quite worth
the attentions of a professional pois-
oner and you say that neither the
young lady nor the fdbtman will admit
that its beauty tempted them to risk a
life for it-yours and one of theirs

 blake nodded dumbly his mind
blunted against norroys pleasantry
behind his chair the housekeeper
snorted audibly in hollys direction

  rather odd that a young woman of
so agreeable an appearance should need
a champion norroy continued still in
his tone of amiable reproof nor can

i detect any desire for one in her man-
ner but i wonder if she would mind
if we assume she is innocent-only for
a moment and despite appearances 

   blake stared stolidly before him and
norroy went on evenly

   quite possibly of course she came
to dine with you with murder in her
heart but-but did you find any
poison on her

  blake fidgeted indecisively in a
moment he admitted that she had not
been searched but he protested that the
presence of the jade plate in her dress
would pronounce her guilty with any
jury whose heads had remained on
their shoulders

  in a second yorke norroy had
stepped to the man who was obscured
in the shadows of the far end of the
room and with a viselike pressure on
his arm lie brought him near the table
presently from one of the inner pock-
ets of the fellows waistcoat norroy
drew forth a tiny pasteboard box
under his masters eye the footman
dared make no move and norroys
tapping of his shrinking body had been
done expertly the man followed nor-
roy to blakes side and had begun to
speak when he caught a steely gleam
from the eyes behind the spectacles
he waited

   norroy was leisurely testing in a lit-
tle water the white powder which the
box contained in a few moments he
looked up

   this is the narcotic that stupefied
you he said quietly to blake if it
had been dropped into hot water it
would have been enough to kill you
but i dare say the solvent was cold
leaving much of the stuff undissolved-
-eh let us see he held toward the
light the champagne glass from which
blake had drunk three hours earlier
in which a group of crystals was evi-
dent clinging to the inner side

  blakes expression changed he
glanced quickly at holly then away
again the girl sat chin in hand
watching the proceedings intently but
without a sound the footman inter-
posed in haste his little eyes blinking
in the effort to be coherent he came
the cuio collector



to blakes side and whispered in his
ear

  talk out loud shouted his master
roughly an instinct for justice at work
somewhere beneath his indecision the
servant braced himself to meet nor-
roys gaze faltered a moment before
the steadiness of it but went on after
a gulp

  she put it there he cried strug-
gling to make his speech plain i felt
her hand fumbling around my back
when i pulled her away from the case
and i said to myself shes up to some
mischief but i didnt have time to
think of it afterward-she kept me so
busy i had a fight to g the plate and
i forgot her sly fingers then she
jumped over tp the housekeepers bell
thinking to call mrs parker and blame
it all on me and then-then you woke
up mr blake if youd have waited
another minute id have known it was
the poison she put on me for i could
feel the box against my ribs but my
brain was whirling sir

  the mans protestations -filled the
room his white face had taken on a
scared look that carried his words into
his masters mind his very confusion
worked in his favor seeming to be the
tremors of an honest man hard pressed

  blake looked at him blankly attempt-
ing to check off the likely points in the
mans story the housekeeper had gone
to the kitchen with her towels and hot
water her mind still occupied solely
with her injured master and holly
sat quietly in her chair watching the
throwing of the dice that would decide
her fate realizing that norroy stood at
the head of the gaming board once
she glanced at her friend across the ta-
ble where he sat hidden in the blue
incense of his cigarette she heard one
of his nails slowly tappingthe arm of
his chair then suddenly the smoke
was brushed aside and a hand still idly
waving in the air norroy spoke

  doubtless our friend the footman
is right mr blake he said doubt-
less he entered this room on the most
innocent of errands and doubtless he
stopped an experienced criminal in her
path he seems a rather able pleader

in his own behalf however and the
young lady says nothing perhaps-
just perhaps-that fact prejudices me
in her favor added to it is another
circumstance-this small object-and
norroy flipped across the table the
cover of the little box-on which the
druggist has written the name of the
buyer and the name is not a womans
name

   blake picked up the cover hurriedly
and the housekeeper who was again in
the room leaned over his shoulder
both of them read conrsd baker
written in ink baker said nothing but
mrs parker shrilled out the name of
her employer and turned upon him

   yorke norroy had risen in his place
and was regarding blake intently now
and quite seriously i propose that
we give the girl a chance he said
after a pause she seems to deserve
the benefit of the doubt-at least

   the benefit of the doubt blakes
voice was trembling in a reaction and
he gazed at the man and woman before
him with eyes that filled-at last-with
something like shame	

   she deserves more than the benefit
of the doubt he stammered she
deserves my apologies i wish she
would forgive me if she can if she
will understand that i was not very
well that i was a bit stunned by the
whole affair-

  holly had risen and was slowly
drawing  a white glove you are
forgiven she interrupted one hard-
ly knows what to think when one is in
a swirl as we all were half an hour
ago i didnt myself i am not sure
that i do now-because my head aches
perhaps and because i want awfully to
go home can you spare the doctor
long enough to let him put me in a
cab mr blake

   before the clubman could reply nor-
roy laid a detaining finger on his arm
during the call three days before he
had taken the measure of the wavering
fellow spoiled by the surfeit that
wealth had brought him from the day
he was born undermined everv hour
since by the ease of substituting his
check book for his own will in getting


the popular magazine

what he wanted he was the usual
product of his plutocratic class neither
better nor worse norroy knew the
type too well to expect real generosity
of him save at one point-his relations
with women there nature frequently
raised a bulwark against the power of
money he knew that the spoiled blake
had a glimmering of that fact oftener
perhaps than he would have acknowl-
edged he had caught the touch of
real shame in the clubmans reply to
holly men more seasoned than blake
had won a womans genuine gratitude

and by gifts rarer than jade-

  norroy leaned on the table one el-
bow pinning the precious disk to the
boards and turned a magnetic eye to-
ward the man in the chair he began
slowly evenly and-as usual-far dis-
tant from the point at which he aimed

  before we go i should like to in-
quire about this speck of jade he said
deliberately it came near to causing
your undoing my dear sir and doubt-
less you think it hardly worth all that
as a sample of manchu art however
i can see that it has points--
norroy got no further he had
meant to suggest a gift remembering
the outburst that had greeted his prof-
fer of money earlier in the week the
gathering fire in blakes eye told him
how completely the idea had missed its
mark the mans jaw suddenly be-
came almost formidablethe faint hard
lines about his nose and mouth grown
lax since the need for them had depart-
ed with his money-gathering ancestors
reappeared and for a moment he
guarded the coveted green plaque with
a fury that would have done credit to
his vigorous forbears

  the jade stays here he shouted
it doesnt leave the house has hur-
rish got his fingers in everything is
this girl working for him after all-
and you too ill lock it away in the
dark before any of you get it i tell
you ill send it to a safe-deposit vault

before your eyes ill-

  with a little sweeping movement
norroy quickly moved the plate a few
inches out of his way the arm that
blake had stretched out was weak with

rage in a moment he sank coughing
into his chair for one still second
holly watched norroy bending appar-
ently motionless over the table and in
another flash he had turned to mix a
stimulant in a glass presently he was
forcing the liquid between blakes
teeth

  drink this and keep quiet you
forget yourself my man the iron
command in his tone entered blakes
fury like a sword and broke it the
potion cleared his head in a moment
and when calmness returned the shaken
man relapsed into a sullen silence

  norroy had gotten into his coat and
beckoned holly toward the door from
the threshold he glanced across to mrs
parker who had instinctively obeyed
him from the beginning and who now
stood blubbering a little as she bathed
her masters wrists in ice water

  better stop crying and get ready
for mr blakes orders norroy said to
her kindly in a few minutes he will
be well enough to give them mean-
while suppose you telephone your mes-
sage to the police station

  norroy nodded toward the footman
baker who had remained crumpled
and speechless in the corner his escape
from the closed room impossible his
cowed eyes watching norroys least
movement

  i shall remain on this floor until i
hear the bluecoats went on the secret
agent i am taking this young woman
to one of the street windows where she
can get the fresh air she needs and
by the way he added i wouldnt call
out the reserves from the station one
officer will do the man looks-well
a trifle discouraged

  norroy had turned his back for the
last time when blake opening his eyes
and searching the ill-lighted table con-
fusedly cried with a final flash of wild-
ness

  the plate the plate wheres the
plate 

 norroy paused waved one hand
backward and shouted sternly over his
shoulder use your eyes man-your
eyes

  and blake using them saw a deep-
the cijcrio collector



green disk blotting the white cloth be-
fore him he turned toward the door
with an unsteady effort at triumph but
norroy and the girl had gone

  two burly guardians of the peace ar-
rived presently and bore the humble
disturber without protest away the
footman had the intuitions of his kind
he had seen his prison term stretching
before when he looked into norroys
intent eyes and felt the deft fingers
tapping his pockets after the poison

  talbot blake had recovered suffi-
ciently to make his complaint against
the man and when the group had gone
he sent mrs parker to bed the old
woman left reluctantly voicing com-
ments on the entire affair on her way
down the hall weeping from sheer ex-
haustion

  in a moment she was back in the
room with a yellow envelope in her
hand she had found a messenger boy
at the apartment door who being
passed by the night man below had
failed to find blakes bell and had been
pounding the wood his entry was the
final straw the old woman collapsed
on blakes hands he had to revive
her with brandy before he tore open
his envelope at length he was able
to read the five words

  look at the jade plate

  plainly it was an anonymous mes-
sage but together they gazed for mo-
ments at the place where the name
ought to have been then together
they rushed for the plate it was on
the table untouched by mortal hands
since they had seen it last the cryptic
characters graven as deeply as ever in
its dark adamantine surface

  its the man he cried the fel-
low had a sneering look in his eye

  its the woman she expostulated
the minx is a-mockin at us behind
our backs

  they hovered about the table asking

each other the stupid questions natural
to the occasion and returning now and
again to the plate where it indubitably
lay-under the full glare now of every
incandescent in the room

  presently they began to droop ex-
citement fought a losing battle with
sleep and at length blake strode un-
easily to the curio cases with the idea
of locking the jade away but he found
he was too sleepy to combat the diffi-
cult lock he brought the plate back
to the table striving to concentrate on
the idea of doing something with it

  instead of making a decision at the
moment he ordered mrs parker to
bed again and this time she got there

  thus it happened that he was alone
when the second telegram came deliv-
ered by a youngster who found the bell
and executed a triumphant tattoo upon
it that finally convinced blake-who
was putting out the lights-that the
noise was something other than the
buzzing in his own head

  he read the message once sleepily
then his eyes opened and he absorbed
it in a flash instantly he sprang to
his full height and brought his fist
down  the plate beside him with a
terrific impact the effort exhausted
him and the man fell back in his chair
listlessly the yellow slip crumpled in
his hand

  late the next forenoon the house-
keeper found him still asleep where he
had fallen a check for a thousand dol-
lars on the carpet and a litter of shat-
tered green pieces added to the wreck
of the dining table mrs parker pieced
together the torn telegram and read it

  thanks for your hospitality to miss lea
she and i regret the necessity of taking
away the jade accomplished quite simply
by a movement of my palm you will find
the substitute i left with you adequate for
show purposes i am also inclosing you the
sum michael trask offered you last week for
the curio the american national bank will
cash the check at any time

the two flags

by donal hamilton haines

author of men and mercenariesthe cross buck etc

    by a chance fall of the dice payne the soldier of fortune finds himself
wearing a scarlet coat instead of a black leather helmet all flags look alike to
the professional fighting man but payne had more love for one flag than the
other and at the very moment when the taste of his triumph should have been
sweetest he felt nothing but a bitterness beyond his powers of speech

the ground of the little farm-
yard softened from recent
rains had been cut and smashed
into a perfect quagmire by the
trampling of hoofs from a corner of
the barn a field-telegraph corps hard-
pressed for poles had strung its wire
every window of the whitewashed
farmhouse had been flung open and
scarlet-coated figures could be seen
moving about inside more scarlet-
coated men stood in the tiny porch and
others sat their horses in the muddy
yard

  inside the largest room of the house
hugh payne clad in the uniform of the
rcd guard of kelmark sat at a rough
pine table a huge map spread before
him its surface covered with little red-
and-blue counters arranged in rough
blocks and squares

  keep an eye on the wire lieuten-
ant payne said to a subaltern who had
thrust his head out the window we
ought to be hearing from nielsen

  the room-full almost to crowding
with the kellish officers-fell strangely
silent the peasant who had been ruth-
lessly despoiled of his home to make
room for headquarters came and stood
in the open doorway unrebuked payne
sat silent his big pipe between his teeth
the blue eyes on either side of the
hooked nose intent on the map his long
brown fingers touching two of the red
counters his officers and aids watched

him eagerly and talked to each other
in low tones

  a sudden movement on the part of
the lieutenant by the open window drew
every eye to him he leaned far out
and took something from one of the
telegraph men

  read it commanded payne as the
young officer started toward him

  general nielsen reports eighth and
thirteen infantry in positions assigned
third and twelfth in reserve fourth
lancers scoring both banks of river
enemy making no move to advance
a huge sigh went up from every man
in the room payne leaned over his
map and moved five of the red coun-
ters into position along the blue line
which marked the course of a river

  gentlemen he said i think we
had better rest for the morning the
stage is set

  there was a restless movement on
the part of the older officers in the
room then one of them-a gray-haired
heavy-set man-came to the opposite
side of the table at which payne sat
and saluted rather awkwardly

  you have saved kelmark general
he said bluntly we know that if our
foe is beaten to-morrow he will not
dare fight again-and it is you who
have beaten him

  payne shook his head with a slow
smile

  no general he answered i have
thb two flags



not beaten him i have only done this
much and he pointed to the map
the beating is in your hands

  left alone payne got abruptly from
his seat and walked to the open win-
dow across a field he could see smoke
arising from the camp fires of reserve
regiments the bearskin shako of the
sentry on duty showed above the line of
a brick wall the voices of his chief of
staff and some of the senior officers
came from another room of the house

  yes payne said slowly i have
saved kelmark-and for what be-
cause it is all in a days work because
i have been well paid for it it is the
chance fall of the dice that i am wear-
ing a scarlet coat and not a black leather
helmet

  for years hugh payne professional
fighting man had been dreaming of
moments such as this and had come to
laugh at himself for having such
dreams those times that he had shiv-
ered at the head of tiny expeditions
fighting their way through the drifts
of himalayan foothills or struggled
through a hot south american forest
with an army of ragged discontents and
negroes he had almost been driven to
the belief that his chosen profession
must be without great honor yet here
he was clad in the uniform of a regi-
ment which numbered the names of
princes among its n c officers
practical head of a european army-
though nominally only a divisional com-
mander-and planning for the next day
the humbling of one of the great pow-
ers of europe

  and yet in the very moment when
the taste of his triumph should have
been sweetest payne felt nothing but
a bitterness beyond his powers of
speech he stood by the open window
tearing to pieces in his mind the big-
ness of what he had done it was not
much after all that huge power
whose regiments were now bivouacking
across theriver had hustled forward a
small army in the belief that kelmark
was incapable of real resistance payne
called in as an expert- at the eleventh
hour had planned and executed a series
of masterly retreats which had sup-

ported the enemy in his mistaken be-
liefs and led him into a position where
his discomfiture might be accomplished
and once kelmark had checked its huge
foe at least three european powers
whose word carried weight would call
enough  and hasten to interfere

  to-morrow payne muttered i
may beat regiments whose names were
known in the days of napoleon-and it
does not mean as much as rushing a
stockade of savages with men who have
fought and lived at my side

  a sudden gust of wind made the flag
hanging from the gatepost flutter out
stiffly payne looked at the white cross
on the red field it meant nothing to
him until a few weeks before he had
known it only as he knew all things per-
taining to his business now he was
fighting under it and the men who
fought with him cared for it fought
for it by this time the next day they
would be shouting his name-and he
would not care already he knew that
there would be no joy in winning
there would be actually a greater de-
light in defeat that at least would
rouse him to win would merely mean
another period of drifting until he
found another flag which needed him
for the moment-perhaps the one
whose confusion he was even now plan-
ning

  he turned abruptly and walked to
the map for an instant he stood star-
ing down at it then with a short laugh
he shifted a few of the red markers

  in five minutes he said slowly i
could issue the orders for those move-
ments and no man would question me
by morning i would have wrecked kel-
mark with those four regiments
moved and the flank laid open the
thing would be easy for our blue-coated
friends

  he replaced the pieccs and sat down
on the edge of the table filling his pipe
and letting his mind play with the fu-
ture after this what only too well
he knew the ways of nations who have
been helped out of tight places by men
not of their own blood he would be
well paid honored after a formal fash-
ion given a handsome sword-and left


the pcpulr magazine

to himself he would be a wanderer
again-no nearer the chance to serve
under one flag which would mean for
him what the red-and-white banner
meant to the big sentry at the gate

  gradually he forced himself to throw
off the feeling that had seized him and
spent two hours over his map supper
with his staff in the big kitchen was a
rather silent meal the kells were not
talkative nor was his command of their
tongue sufficient to make conversation
easy his final orders wrere given in a
mixture of kellish and french and he
went back into the big bare room and
threw himself onto the cot in the cor-
ner

  lie had lain on his back half an hour
staring at the gray ceiling of the room
when he heard the sentry challenge
sharply then call for the officer of the
guard payne got to his feet and
looked out of the window in time to see
the -officer flash an electric pocket flash
in the face of the man who stood at the
point of the sentrys bayonet at the
sight of the mans face payne gave an
exclamation and leaned out the open
window

  it is not regular lieutenant he
heard the newcomer saying but i as-
sure you there is no time for delay i
must see general payne at once

  the young kell stood twisting his
mustache in some perplexity

  what is it lieutenant payne
called sharply

  the officer turned and came toward
the house the stranger walking in front
of him and stopped within a few feet
of the open window

  this man claims to have important
news for you general he explained
he has no papers and is ignorant of
the countersign he is unarmed-but i
cannot see how he can have passed the
outer lines shall i lock him up

  no answered payne briefly send
him in-and stay at the door ill call

  an instant later a tall slender man
with a lean wrinkled face came into
the room the lieutenants figure show-
ing dimly behind him

  you want to speak to me payne
demanded

  yes answered the other swinging
the door shut behind him the two
men stood looking at each other fixedly
for an instant then the newcomer held
out his hand and payne took it unhesi-
tatingly

  i thought it was you the lean man
said shortly although your name
hasnt leaked out

  payne motioned his visitor to the
other side of the room

 youve given me a hard task
krupp he said gravely you ought
to have known better theres only
one thing i can do with you

  krupp sat down quietly on-the edge
of paynes cot and took off his cap

  i suppose so he answered but
youll hear me out 

  payne his arms behind his back
looked at the lean figure of the swiss
the last time he had seen the brown
face and the pointed yellow beard had
been when the two of them were tin-
kering at the clogged mechanism of
krupps schoenhauer in the bottom of
a wet trench

  go ahead he commanded

  almost at the first words payne
started krupp did not talk as he had
expected he would in the even tones
that payne had heard many a time he
spoke of the lives the two of them had
led of the times their lives had touched
-of the present moment and of what
might come afterward krupp had a
tongue flis services were more often
rendered in court dress than in khaki
and payne listened as other men had
done the words of the swiss fitted
with almost uncanny nicety into the
broken ends of paynes interrupted
thoughts

  you and i krupp was saying are
held fortunate by some poor devils tied
down to garrison duty or trading post-
but we know hugh we know fortu-
nate  ah wrhat wouldnt i give if i
could put on a blue coat and a pair of
gray trousers and sit down to idle away
the rest of my days in geneva or any
other place under my own colors and
what wouldnt you give to take the next
steamer--	

  never mind that payne inter-
thb two flags



rupted sharply ive my own thoughts
krupp

  the swiss waited a moment giving
his words time to rankle his next
question was abrupt

  you remember melchistan

  payne nodded instantly he saw the
trim streets of the little town and the
ring of blue mountains beyond krupp
leaned forward

  listen he commanded youve
been out of things for a minute--god
knows where and you dont know
melchistan is about to make history
once you and i talked of how beautiful
it would be if a certain nation made
melchistan into a buffer state-one
strong enough so that it could not be
kicked aside well the thing is done
six weeks hugh payne and there will
be a new flag flying-do you hear that
a new flag it will be a place for men
who want to make a new start-and i
need not tell you that it will be a place
where there will be fighting a-plenty
well payne said sharply

  in melchistan krupp went on
there will be needed a man who has
done nothing but pull triggers all his
days he must know more than the
value of good sights he must know
whether the austrian is better than the
french style of gun emplacement and
what sort of fortifications are best
against lyddite it is not a six months
or a years work-it is a lifetimes he
must be a big man and he will leave
a big work behind him he will leave
the state of melchistan-which will be
another way of saying the keystone to
the map of that part of the world and
it will be his country

  payne had commenced to pace rap-
idly back and forth across the room

  by glory krupp he said finally
it is a miracle it is what we have
prayed for

  krupp shifted in his seat very slight-
ly he had driven the first parallel of
the hardest siege in his career of per-
suasion 

  i dont lie do i lie demanded
sharply

  no answered payne stopping
short in his walk

  well then continued the swiss
in the name of certain powers i do not
need to specify i offer you the com-
mand of the forces of melchistan
the sharp indrawing of paynes
breath sounded clearly in the room

  that isnt all he answered in a
low tone tell me the rest krupp
he listened intently while krupp
traced the wrigglings of certain bits of
diplomacy which were not recorded in
the archives of those nations that had
had a hand in them gradually the
trend of krupps logic became appar-
ent and payne sat down suddenly his
mind in a turmoil

  it surprises you doesnt it krupp
demanded it would surprise some of
those red-coated gentry in the next
room too kelmark has been fooled
you have been fooled a good part of
humanity has been fooled

  payne found his words with some
little difficulty

  so if kelmark should win to-mor-
row he said the state of melchistan
becomes a thing as impossible of exist-
ence as the fourth dimension

  there is no chance of kelmarks
winning krupp replied confidently
but that is not the question kel-
marks army must be destroyed wiped
out and the army that annihilates them
ready to entrain for the other frontiers
in thirty-six hours

  payne left his seat crossed the room
and lighted a small lamp which he
placed on the table

  some one besides kelmark has been
fooled he said shortly see here
he watched the swiss while he bent
over the map does that look as
though kelmark would lose he de-
manded

  krupp fingered his yellow beard
ten thousand thunders he swore
under his breath in french youre a
devil payne

  payne shrugged

  you see he asked

  i see that you hold the possibility
of melchistan between your thumb and
finger the swiss answered evenly

  you dont mean- payne com-
menced andthen stopped


the popular magazine

  krupp was too wise in the ways of
mens minds to speak he let payne
struggle with the things that flashed
into his brain the american walked
again to one of the open windows while
his visitor sat down by the table they
remained so for several minutes

  see hugh krupp said after the
pause you have only to do this and 
this and you may have the designing
of the melchistan uniform

  he stretched out his fingers and
payne conscious of a sudden tremor
saw the swiss make exactly the same
moves with the red counters that he
himself had made a few hours before
then while payne stood with his back
turned krupp went on quietly

  a great chance that for a fighting
man like yourself thirty thousand
men i think it is planned that the army
should be thirty thousand men and a
round dozen good batteries of horse ar-
tillery beside the mountain batteries i
have looked forward to planning the
details with you-you and the french-
man and i hugh what keen joy it
would be to decide upon the uniform
for our melchistan lancers and to test
out those new english rifles and some
of the american automatics before we
let sauer have the contracts after all
payne whirled suddenly and took
two strides toward the door

  where are you going his prisoner
demanded sharply

  to turn you over to the guard
payne said in a hard toice

  krupp shrugged his shoulders

  very well he said casually but
its foolish its worse than foolish
havent i told you that it wont matter
the price of a cartridge whether kel-
mark wins or not-as far as kelmarks
future is concerned this little coun-
try doesnt matter its a pawn that has
to be knocked over at this stage of the
game and youre deliberately rock-
ing big things and your own interests to
give a lot of soldiers in red coats a fool-
ish victory to shout themselves hoarse
over and listen he finished do
you think that if kelmark balks our
friends now and the melchistan proj-
ect dissolves in thin air before its fair-

ly born-do you think our friends will
forget youre not doing kelmark a
service

  payne took two more steps and laid
his hand on the knob of the door both
men could hear a slight clank as the
scabbard of the waiting subaltern struck
the wooden post of the porch

  krupp got to his feet with another
gesture of resignation

  im sorry he said i like being a
man without a country no better than
you do and i had found one for us
both-a new one whose making might
be in our hands i dont know what
lies behind you i only know the thing
i did wasnt enough to make me the
wanderer that i am and you and i
and a lot more than we could name
might have given something to the
world in melchistan now they wont
even know its name-and kelmark will
win a battle which had been better lost
go on he added almost nervously
open the door and end it

  payne jerked the door open quickly

  come in lieutenant he ordered

  the young subaltern came in and
stood stiffly at attention his eyes trav-
eling from payne to krupp and back
again

 lieutenant halle payne an-
nounced this is herr krupp-per-
haps i should say colonel krupp late
of the turkish army

  the two men bowed to each other
rather stiffly both looking at payne-
krupp with wonder in his glance

  by a stroke of fortune payne
went on smoothly herr krupp with
whom it has been my good luck to serve
in several campaigns was traveling
well within the disputed territory and
has been in a position to observe the
operations of our opponents only to-
night indeed he has observed move-
ments which had escaped our own
scouts and which necessitate immediate
changes in our own dispositions will
you be good enough to arouse the gen-
tlemen in the next room lieutenant and
impress upon them the necessity for
haste

  halles heels clicked together he sa-
luted and went quickly out of the room
the two flags



krupp stood motionless looking at
paynes back they were still standing
thus when the officers of the staff came
into the room

  paynes explanations were brief his
orders even briefer the kells scowled
somewhat and some questioning
glances were directed at krupp who
was smoking a cigarette with an air of
polite interest

  we shall have to thank herr krupp
for the loss of a few hours sleep
payne said smilingly we must see
that nielsen is in his new position be-
fore dawn

  while the horses were being saddled
payne turned for an instant to the
swiss

  god knows he said whats right
and whats wrong will you ride with
me

  krupp shook his head

  no he answered until some
time to-morrow im herr lupsch of
vienna stopping at the inn at deppel

ii

  as his horse carried him forward
through the darkness his staff splash-
ing through the mud behind him
payne seemed to have been suddenly
cursed with two minds one fairly
gloated on the pictures krupp had
drawn for him the other was with the
grim earnest men who galloped at his
heels he was not one to take a step
and then be consumed with regrets
hesitation was no part of him an-
other man might have questioned the
truth of what the swiss had told him
but payne knew the stuff of which
krupp was made

  yet it was the second time in his life
that he had done a thing which had
two sides and the memory of that first
time had been fresh in his mind that
night come what might kelmark
would know him one day for a man
who had deliberately brought defeat
upon it payne was not one to split
hairs nor to dodge facts he faced the
ugliness of his position squarely un-
complainingly as a strong man bares
his wound to the surgeons probe

  deliberately he thrust all thoughts of
the last two hours out of his mind and
turned to consideration of the battle
which daylight would bring-a battle
he would have to fight knowing that
he had beaten himself by his own act
before ever a gun was fired he swung
round in his saddle and called to the
group behind him

  will you ride with me dahlgren
he asked informally

  the same broad-shouldered gray-
haired officer who had thanked payne
for saving kelmark earlier in the day
pushed his horse forward until he rode
at the americans side almost eager-
ly payne talked to him of the shifting
of forces which had been begun to meet
this supposed change of plan on the
part of the foe

  nielsens four regiments and the
lancers should give us weight enough
on the right to hold them in check he
explained or even to assume the offen-
sive if occasion arises

  the old kell rode for some distance
without replying then said with a sort
of stubborn diffidence

  t confess sir i have wondered why
you left the bridge standing after you
ordered nielsens forces moved

  one of those queer twists of the will
that make men suddenly desire to throw
themselves from the tops of high cliffs
or buildings suddenly caught payne he
had actually to grip himself to prevent
his tongue from telling the true reason
-that the bridge had deliberately been
left unguarded in order that the blue-
clad troops might secure a quick and
easy pathway into the unguarded flank
of the kellish army

  it is what you might call my ameri-
can instincts i suppose he replied
lightly there is i will admit a faint
chance that the enemy might perceive
his opportunity and push a few troops
across-even follow them with more
and gain a leverage against our left-
but the chance is of the slightest i
could remove this danger by destroying
the bridge but by doing so i would
lessen my own chances

  i dont quite follow you dahlgren
said


the popular magazine

  paynes answer dealt with the num-
bers of regiments the state of roads
the slopes of hills the protection to be
had from certain cloaking forests he
could hear the veterans breath come
faster as he followed the details of the
plan

  you see he concluded it is no
more than what a boxer would call a
shift he pulls his strength to one
side we do the same to meet the added
weight and then suddenly switch back
the force we have pulled from in front
of him and drive it home where he is
weakest

  dahlgren took a long breath

  it is a risk he said but by heav-
en sir it is worth the taking

  the road they followed plunged sud-
denly between two bare rugged hills
one paralleling the other running at
right angles to the road two miles to
the north payne knew another road
was choked with nielsens two regi-
ments the eighth and thirteenth
trudging through the darkness in an-
swer to the order which he had given
the big hill on his right might well in a
few hours form a screen behind vhich
the enemy should gather those regi-
ments destined for the swinging blow
which would scatter the red-coated
troops

  a moment later the staff stumbled
onto the rear guard of the reserve regi-
ments also plodding through the mud
with their faces to the east somewhere
ahead of them were the lancers who
should have been guarding the bridge

  a bonfire had been lighted to guide
the infantry around the edge of a quag-
mire formed in the road by the drench-
ing rains of the past few days and
payne and his officers sat their horses
and watched the infantry march past in
the flickering light

  for the first time payne felt a little
thrill of pride in the men he com-
manded he had said do this and
do that to the wearers of a dozen
uniforms he had seen more brilliant
more dashing troops than these kells-
the line regiments in dingy campaign
uniforms the guards in the scarlet and
bearskins worn in deference to tradi-

tion but there was a stolid cheerful-
ness a quiet muscular purposefulness
about these light-haired sober-faced
linesmen and guards which suddenly
awoke new sensations in the man who
watched them they were not typical
fighting men they were farmers and
artisans clerks and petty shopkeepers
conscripts every one of them-but con-
scripts of a strangely willing sort love
of country was strong within them

  by george payne exclaimed al-
most involuntarily these chaps are leg-
gers i had not looked for them this
far along for half an hour

  the twelfth there has a marching
record of eighteen miles under full
equipment over poor roads in four
hours and a half dahlgren said with
quiet pride

  the staff pushed on following a road
which ran straight east behind a line
of hills on which the kells lay waiting
for the morning a thin light accom-
panied by a drizzle of rain was break-
ing as they pushed their horses up a
steep slope and dismounted the hill
which had been picked for headquar-
ters during the battle had already been
marked by the telegraph corps and dim
figures were visible through the mist
stringing a single wire

  payne sat his horse muffled in an un-
military-looking slicker dahlgren and
one or two other officers beside him
the rest of the staff and aids grouped
a little behind payne was suddenly
conscious of dalilgrens voice in his ear
-so low as to be inaudible to the other
officers

  do you realize sir what victory will
mean to the army and to kelmark  the
old man was saying you come from
a land that is young but has done much
kelmark was ancient before men had
dreamed of america yet it is cen-
turies since a kellish army has tri-
umphed over a foe our troops have
paraded the streets our drums have
beat in the sleepy squares of peaceful
towns our guns should have rusted
but we have kept them bright waiting
for the chance men have laughed at
us or worse forgotten us we have
not counted-and now he paused
the two flags



and payne felt the sudden viselike
pressure of the big stubby fingers on
his arm it is a new lease of life it
is an epoch it is a new birth for a land
that was old

  payne stared down the wet slope of
the hill with a face turned suddenly
hard as flint a strange feeling of re-
sentment toward the men of the army
he was leading burned within him al-
ways they had showed themselves to
him hard heavy unfeeling and now
in a single instant and after it vas too
late this rocklike figure at his side had
burst through its reserve and showed
him the bruised pride of a nation

  from far across the river came a low
sullen report that rolled and echoed
among the hills even as the enemys
first gun sounded the drizzling rain
ceased and a yellow tinge shot into the
gray sky in the east whatever thoughts
had been in the minds of payne and
the men about him dropped suddenly
away dawn and the battle had come
together and the work of this greatest
of all days for most of them had begun

  payne looked down into the broad
deep valley of the river he knew that
the kellish forces invisible as yet in the
dim light stretched in a jagged line five
miles to his right and a mile to his left
straight in front of him lay the great
masses he had held in reserve the cav-
alry in a fold of the hills behind them
on somewhat lower ground their ex-
posed position strengthened by every
known artificial means lay the six bat-
teries pushed daringly close to the
river that their blows might strike the
harder

  gradually the volume of the enemys
shell fire increased as battery after bat-
tery took up the work but the kellish
batteries waited in grim silence accord-
ing to orders slowly the hostile shells
worked down to the faint yellow-
brown lines of the intrenchments as
the shadow of a passing cloud moves
across a field-only the shells stopped
as they caught the yellow line then
with a roar the kellish batteries flared
into life

  those things which were passing in
front were passing as had been planned
b

 the staff looked upon the progress of
 the artillery duel with contented eyes
 only payne of the group of horsemen
 was thinking of something else-of the
 dark regiments who must already be
 pushing forward toward the bridge in-
 explicably left free to their pleasure

   straight below the hill on which the
 staff sat their horses lay one of the
  three bridges two miles beyond it the
 second a mile farther the third behind
 each one were the scars of trenches
 about them the enemys shells were
 curving dropping bursting minute
 after minute passed with no seeming
 cessation of the bombardment then
 slowly the curving white arcs grew
 fewer the hostile batteries were being
 checked

   payne sat with his watch in his hand
 from one corner of his eye he watched
 the man behind him who sat on a camp
 stool with the receiver of a field tele-
 phone strapped to his head the amer-
 ican hardly turned his head to watch the
 enemys first attempts to rush the
 bridges they failed as he had known
 they would fail

   dark masses of infantry slashed here
 and there by blocks of white where the
 crack regiments of the enemys guards
 moved rolled out of the screen of tim-
 ber beyond the river broke into smaller
 sections and swept down toward the
 bridges three times the thudding bat-
 teries and rattling krags in the kellish
 trenches swept them back

   on all sides of him the phlegmatic
 wooden-faced officers of his staff were
 giving way to emotions of whose very
 existence payne had never guessed
 dahlgren sat his horse like a man of
 stone his hands folded on the pommel
 of his saddle the tears streaming un-
 noticed down his furrowed cheeks
 some of the younger officers shouted
 and wept like children a sweating
 subaltern of a dragoon regiment dashed
 up with a plea that the cavalry be al-
 lowed to charge if the enemys next
 rush were driven back

  not yet payne answered we
may need every lance in another hour

   his eyes were fixed on the man at
the telephone his ears strained to pierce


the popular magazine

 the din and catch any of those sinister
 sounds which must come soon from the
 west the voices of the men about him
 and the crash of volleys in the river bot-
 tom told him that another rush of the
 enemys regiments had been beaten
 back from the bridges

  he saw the cheeks of the man at the
telephone go suddenly white an in-
stant later an orderly was gasping at his
side

  theyve crossed the bridge to the
west he panted the heads of their
columns are over already

  the mans voice fairly shrill with
fright sounded clearly above the roar
of firing payne knew that every man
of his staff had heard for an instant
as he raised his head in answer to the
mans words he seemed carried away
from all that surrounded him alone
with his own thoughts

  he saw the town of melchistan ten
times larger and finer than the town he
had known with trim cruisers lying in
the blue harbor smart cavalrymen in
the streets and markets foreign diplo-
mats in the lobbies of the government
buildings-and a new clean flag snap-
ping in the winds which came down
from the mountain barrier in the north

  then he looked up and saw dahl-
grens face

  payne had never seen such an ex-
pression on human features there
was no suspicion no anger no fear in
the old soldiers face yet payne seemed
to see in it all the terrible mute disap-
pointment of the world-old plodding
patient people led to the very edge of
a splendid triumph only to be dashed
back at the very moment of victory

 melchistan became suddenly the frag-
ile dream of visionary diplomats the
wild scheme of mad plotters the real
hard things of life were the face of the
old man with the tear-stained cheeks
and the somber-hued regiments edging
into his rear

  with a gesture which none who saw
him could interpret payne flung all
thoughts of the swiss and his plans all
the hopes of long years of fighting and
dreaming into the past he whirled in
his saddle and barked orders like an

angry terrier the group of aids and
orderlies vanished their horses hoofs
scarring the soft slopes of the hillside
the officers of the staff caught their
breath as they realized what payne was
doing

  general protested a dozen voices
you will break our center

  payne swung  them with the tense
fury of a man fighting a well-nigh hope-
less fight intolerant of the least delay

  shall i break it or let them do it
he thundered letsch ride to the cav-
alry and tell them to move out along
the first road behind them follow it
straight west and when they find the
enemy charge him

  men scarcely breathed while the sec-
onds ticked and the enemys batteries
across the river thundered and ham-
mered paving the way for another
rush four splendid regiments of cav-
alry swung from the fold of the hills
which had sheltered them and took the
road at a sharp trot spurring straight
for the center of unguessed thousands
of the enemy

  in response to paynes orders the
eight regiments of the reserve held in
readiness for that counterstroke across
the river which had been planned
swung into four great columns faced to
the west and with their flanks to the
roaring batteries bent toward this new
danger point leaving behind them a
mere skeleton army holding its position
by sheer effrontery

  a young fellow in a dragoons uni-
form stood at paynes side forgetful of
everything but the tragedy that he
sensed before him

  it is the end he faltered we are
in a vise

  payne shook his big shoulders
dahlgren he called those bridges
are in your hands hold them two
hours you may reach me by courier
on the left

  he rode like a madman a few of his
staff making poor work of holding his
pace as he galloped the roar of the
new battle belched out to meet him
from behind the rugged sullen hill he
had seen bulking grimly in the darkness
up the first slope already strewn with
thb two flags



wounded he put his horse overtaking
some straggling linesmen who went for-
ward yelling at the mere sight of him

  from a flat rock on the summit of
the hifr payne looked down into a
veritable furnace not in vain had he
counted on the marching powers of
those eight regiments light and dark-
blue waves were rolling toward the hill
against whose foot lay the eight thou-
sand payne sat down and waited time
alone held the answer now

  an hour passed and with it came a
message from dahlgren scrawled with
a blunt pencil on a leaf from a note-
book 

  we are where we were

  twice the blue waves lapped the foot
of the hill and broke back and the eight
thousand stood firm once a flashing
swarm of dragoons red plumes dancing
beside black above sky-blue tunics
splashed through the shallow water of
a brook floundered across a marsh
which would have made many a cav-
alryman hesitate and bore down on the
flank of the eight thousand timed to
the minute the eager regiments which
payne had refused their chance three
hours before lashed out into the open
and met the swooping dragoons and
even as the blue horsemen broke under
the shock came the second laconic mes-
sage from dahlgren

  we are where we were

  time seemed to stand still to watch
payne found himself clinging to the
rock beside him fairly straining to hold
it in place as his mind struggled to hold
the kells at the foot of the hill he
had called them wooden he knew now
that their heaviness was of better stuff
outweighed man for man outnum-
bered the kells held their ground with
a quiet immobility that served far bet-
ter than any dashing fury they made
no countercharges when the blue
waves fell back they breathed deep
and waited for the next one

 yet payne saw the danger and
moved to meet it

  bring up the fifth and sixth bat-
teries he ordered

  even the galloper who carried the

order started at the nature of it and
payne felt again the eyes of his staff
upon him

  if they back off and use magazine
fire he explainedwith  wave of his
hand at the struggle below were gone
theyll charge or run under shrapnel
but they wont stand still

  for the first time the eight thousand
were staggering when the batteries rat-
tled up

  almost the first shell set fire to the
bridge a single blue figure ran out
upon it and beat frantically at the
flames another shell burst and- the
blue figure vanished while the flames
grew and spread belated batteries on
the far bank took up the fight but the
moment had passed the undertow
of the blue waves surged suddenly
stronger than the forward rush strag-
gling lines of blue surged back onto the
bridge from the eight thousand went
up a hoarse shout that was more than a
cheer

  payne turned almost wearily to an
orderly he felt spent weakened sud-
denly sapped of his strength

  now the lancers he ordered casu-
ally if there are any left

  he walked his horse back over the
half-dried roads in the red afternoon
sunlight the horse walked with hang-
ing head and faltering hoofs complete-
ly winded payne who had won a bat-
tle from himself rode with bowed head

  dahlgren and some of the other offi-
cers were still on the hill from which
payne had ridden on the heels of the
eight thousand as the american rode
forward the kells were suddenly bare-
headed before him dahlgren on foot
walked forward and rested one hand
on the flank of paynes horse

  it is kelmarks one regret that you
are not one of us in blood sir he said

  payne looked at the old man then
past him to where the white cross
snapped victorious on its red field for
an instant he thought of melchistan and
the things which were not to be then
into dahlgrens face and saw the thing
he had done

by emerson hough
author of john pawn  the mississippi bubble etc

     raccoons dont belong on the cow range but curly tells how
     a very sociable one drifted into the corral and made him-
     self so much at home that he became formally adopted
     and learned to play as good a hand of poker as any of the
     boys the humanest coon ever was curly declares

you oughtnt to kick sir alger-
non said curly one day in
camp as we were cleaning a
meager half dozen whitefish
instead of the trout we had intended to
take in that days fishing it aint
no real difference what folks eat when
you stop to think of it now you take
them eight-play dinners some city folks
gets up-everything in it from vinegar
to prunes an sardines to ice cream
put all them things together in one
pan an stir before usin an what liv-
in man could go against it id ruther
look a plain case o beefsteak an onions
in the face yet folks survives even
that kind o eatin its all a matter o
habit er imagination an the real facts
is that almost anything is all right to
eat ef you want it an can git it an can
swaller it

  i dont never like to see a man kick
about his vittals when a feller begins
to select his food right careful youd
better begin to select another man its
right fashionable these days to go on
a diet but when yore friend begins to
diet best thing you kin do is to go
git a cold chisel an a piece o rock
an figger out what nice things you kin
put over him after hes dead eating
is made fer folks that intends to keep
right on livin like you an me sir
algernon same as a grizzly bear or a
cow horse

  its the same way with the soft part
o eatinj too which some folks calls
drinkin speakin of it scornful as ef

it was wrong to git thirsty it aint
wrong cow hands gits thirsty an
look at them now you take a man
from back east that will only drink out
o a bottle with four colors in the lay-
bill-hes marked fer a early tally in
the new angel class not so with them
like you an me sir algernon who
know that everything is all right ef you
want it an kin git it all the animiles
know that aint no doctor tells a cow
horse when to eat grass or hay or
sagebrush or cottonwood bark-he jest
takes em as they come same as fresher
alkali water ef you jest examine the
animile kingdom youll know how fool-
ish this whole doctor business is

  curly said i your story doesnt
hang together animals know whats
good for them and they never give way
to intemperance like cow-punchers and
other depraved classes

  huh said curly is that so
heap you know about it aint it

  well of course animals drink wa-
ter-

  wrhat else kin they git to drink
demanded curly spose you was de-
prived o the power o speech as well
as the price o the drinks an was
dressed up in a hide worth anywhere
from six bits to fifty dollars an had
feet to run away with-would you be
saunterin down to the lone star fer
a drink er would you be pullin fer the
tall woods an what is they to drink
in the tall woods but water look at
us right now an you git the answer to
bbnbze



that only reason animiles dont drink
coffee er something else is that they
cant git it now i can prove that

  i hadnt thought of it in that way
curly i admitted

  thats the trouble with a heap o
people said curly sitting back in the
shade and sticking his knife in the sand
to clean the blade folks dont stop
to think things out right close now
me-im plumb thoughtful i have in
my mind right now the case of ebe-
nezer you maybe never heerd o
him 

  i had again to admit my ignorance
so curly picking up a stick began to
whittle as he enlightened me

  this here story about ebenezer
said he it proves everything i been
tellin you bout eatin an drinkin
things an it shows how animiles is jest
like folks

  who was ebenezer well he was
the fattest sassiest ring-tailedest coon
that ever was raised i reckon maybe
he come from arkansas er missouri
originally an was follerin ol pap
prices trail out to oregon after the
war hed only got as far long as
wyoming when we found him--an you
know coons dont belong here in the
cow country-not none at all it was
right odd how we found him an no-
body knows to this day how come him
to be there in ol man wrights cow
camp on birch creek

  there was several of us boys in
that camp ridin sign an mendin the
dash-blamed fences an sometimes we
didnt have nothin to do much but play-
in cards long in the early spring be-
fore the calf round-up sometimes i
have knew one of our games to last
all night an have knew me er billy
wilson er sandy er some one else to
win as much as forty cents in real
money beside several guns an hand-
kerchiefs an best wishes

  well one mornin wed been havin
a little game all night an come good
daylight we starts out to the horse pen
you know they was a tall post each
side o the gate o the round pen an
all at once billy wilson-who was jest
in from town where hed been after

the mail-he looks up an lets out a
shriek him bein still sort o jerky
fresh from town

   tell me boys says he is they
anything there

  well we all looked up an when
we seen a large dark objeck up on top
o the post lookin down cam with
his pinted face an a nice long black-
an-white tail hangin down the post we
all of us felt like makin our last will
an testerment because they didnt no
such thing belong on the cow range
let alone on top of our corral sandy
an billy they hadnt never saw a coon
an they was too bad scairt to shoot
ebenezer-fer it was none less than
him-he set up there cam an looked
down at us thoughtful i reckon our
surprise was mucherl fer maybe he
had never saw anything like us

   ef it was anywhere but right here
says i to billy after a while id say
that was a coon an a blamed big one
but it cant be a coon an it cant be
here which leaves me in some doubt
says i

   it might as well be a elephant
says barney oldham but it shore
aint a elephant fer elephants dont
have rings on their tails

   no says sandy ner they cant
climb a post

  well we all went an stood around
the foot o the post an looked up
an ebenezer he looked down i seen
him wink one eye at me plain

   say says sandy aint he a awful
human-lookin thing an look at his
tracks tfere in the dust-hes got real
feet

   well hes scairt me awful says
billy whatever he is an i got a no-
tion to shoot him

   no says barney he give me a
awful jolt too an im some grieved
about it but lets take him prisoner
an ast hirh where he come from way
out here curly says he its moved
an seconded that you skin up the pole
an welcome this here little stranger to
our midst

  seein they was no two ways about
it i dim up on the fence an begun
to reach up the pole ebenezer he


thb popular mjgzinb

fluffs up his fur an meets me half-
way

   youd better rope him i reckon
says i

  so then sandy goes an gits his
rope an makes a throw which-ketches
ebenezer round the waist he hits the
ground with a soft chug like coons does
when they fall often a tree it dont
hurt em none-they need a jolt like
that to start up their carbureter

  you ought to of seen ebenezer
spark up he didnt run i reckon he
was peeved anyhow he stood his hair
up on end like a little bear an before
we had time to git away from him he
had bit every one of us from eight to
nineteen times then he laid down on
his back put up his feet an begun to
growl cheerful like he was askin fer
us to come on an tackle him in his
own style o fightin it was a mercy
to him that somebody hadnt of shot
him er else shot somebody else but
things was too mixed fer a while to
make shootin anyways safe

  we all lined up a little ways an
taken a look at ebenezer layin there
on his back lookin fer more trouble

   now i never seen a coon before
says sandy but he shorely is a game
little cuss aint he

   hes got the makin o a good cow-
puncher in him says i besides coons
makes fine pets i move an second we
adopt him sandy you take your rope
offen him

   i dont see how i kin says sandy
thoughtful t aint used to brandin
things quite as active as this party but
we shore orto brand him too ef his
hair wasnt so long fer hes a shore
maverick on our range an there aint
nobody else never branded him none
fers i kin see

  well sir some folks thinks that
animiles dont understand human talk
but they do we hadnt only bout got
this fur along when ebenezer he turns
over on his feet kicks the rope offen
him with a hind foot an not payin no
more tention to us he walks straight
to the open door o the shack like he
had bin invited to make hisself at home

  we seen then he classified hisself
as folns an not critter

  when we come in after him we
seen that he had dim up on the bench
an was drinkin outen the water pail
like one o the hands then he wiped
his face on the towel walked over to
the bench by the table an says he
please to pass the beans-er words to
that effect

  anyhow we did pass him the beans
an ebenezer he set in to make hisself
a square meal then he goes over to
the water pail takes another drink an
casts a eye over the bunks at the side
o the room howd he know which
blankets was mine nobody hadnt
told him but he hears this talk id been
makin bout adoptin him an he adopts
me too without hesitatin beyond that
first look he dims up into my bunk
lays his head on my goose-har piller
an goes to sleep like a gentleman that
has been out late

  speakin o adoptin things says
billy who was still kind o jerky an
not right shore about what he was
seein

   ef its a coon er a human i dunno
says sandy but anyhow it looks like
hes moved in

   yes says i an it looks like i
couldnt go to bed none until ebenezer
gits his rest out we called him ebe-
nezer

   you-all think im right ignerant
says sandy because ive never saw no
coons but ive done read about them
besides i got a heap o respeck fer this
party when he gits normal again hell
dim down an give you a chanct
curly coons sleeps nateral in daytime
an a feller dont need his blankets
then

   anyhow hes got his nerve along
says billy ive a notion to paste him
one now hes asleep

   no dont paste him says sandy
hes just ridin the grub line sames
you an me has many a time an it
aint right to ask him no questions bout
his past life maybe when he comes to
hell tell us his story ef he wants to

   thats right boys says i any
traveler has his right to eat an sleep
benbzbr



without no questions asked i cant
even guess how this gentleman come
way out here but long as he aint
charged with stealin no horses we got
to respeck his privacy let him alone
its my blankets

  well we all let him alone an we
moved round kind o quiet like sos
not to disturb him at exactly half
past four he woke up like hed been
wo and up fer jest that long then he
dim down outen the bunk went to
the water pail fer a drink an strolled
around the place to sort o git acquaint-
ed a little better not payin much at-
tention to us an not makin any kind
o break to run away

   this here thing kind o makes me
feel like sweatin says billy at last
he aint a bear an he aint a dog n
he aint a human but whatever he is
hes a perfeck gentleman an i kin
see right now he means to tote fair ef
hes as good a performer outside as
he is in we kin work the force in two
shifts after this him standin guard at
night an givin us more time fer
poker

  well sir algernon that was how
ebenezer moved in on birch creek
camp he dropped in like a old cow
hand never askin no questions never
kickin on the grub ner even askin
what the pay was i reckon hed looked
up ol man wright before hed moved
in an knowed hed do the right thing

  now he hadnt been in our camp
moren a month before they wasnt one
o the boys would o took lessn  thou-
sand dollars fer ebenezer i got rather
thbest o the break owin to bein
ebenezers first friend an owin also
to his beina nateral-born retriever
he carried up into my bunk most
everything they was loose from socks
to latigos all the time solemn as a
judge an performin open an above-
board like he knowed he was doin
only what was right

  just to show you like i told you
he et an drunk everything there was
he liked coffee an he et eveipthing
without no regard to diet whatever he
come to weigh about sixty pound i
reckon an his tail wras big around as a

piller an the rings on it was enough
to dazzle your eyes he got that shiny
all over even his whiskers got longer
you know coons has to feel with their
whiskers in the dark like a cat an this
made it necessary fer them side hairs
to stick out about eighteen inches on
each side sos to tell how narrer a place
he could git through

  he never had been afraid o none
o us from the start an seein him git
so sizable they wasnt none o us cared
to plague him beyond a certain point
he slep in my bunk daytimes always
goin to bed right after breakfast an
gittin up at half past four in the after-
noon in the night hed saunter around
outdoors to suit hisself goin fishin er
diggin herbs it wasnt long before i
got used to findin crawfish an frogs
an pieces o garter snake hid in my
blankets though the crick wtas moren
two miles away an we all didnt know
they was a frog on the range

  i got right fond o ebenezer-he
was so faithful to me an so useful
he could play as good a hand o poker
as any one o the boys hed set on
my shoulder an look at my hand when
id made my draw an ef i happened
to need a extra king er ace-why ebe-
nezerd go an git it without no trainin
at all hed hand me a card with one
hand while he was attractin the atten-
tion o the next feller by puttin his
foot down the back o his neck his
front feet wras always right cold so
this was hard to git used to although
it was one o his favor-ite amusements

  you neednt tell me that coons cant
think ef luckd be runnin against
me sos id seem to be shy a few chips
this little friend o mine would pass
around the table an take up a collec-
tion fer me-curly he had a nateral
eye fer color an he always wroukl pick
the blue chips first an red ones next
hed bring em all around to me an
pile em up nice an sometimes cover
em up with the corner o the table-
cloth sometimes hed vary the per-
formance by goin around an takin up
a collection o watches keys penknives
an loose change-all o which he brung
to me his poppa


the popular magazine

   ef i wasnt shore hed take a pair
of scissors an cut em open again says
billy wilson complainin i shore
would git me a needle an thread an
sew my pockets tight shut thataway
i might manage to keep some o my
tobakker

  he was right clean like all coons
an he never et nothin without washin
it first as he didnt know no bettern
to wash everything in ttje water pail
we give him a little pan o water fer
his own right by his plate an hed
wash everything he et an sometimes
pile things up beside him in a little
pile-pieces o corned beef an onions
an dried apples an beans-most any-
thing we happened to have thataway
piecin out his diet with things hed
caught like i told you fer a side line
he come through fattern any beef crit-
ter you ever seen

  could he of talked shore he could
ef he had wanted to-but he didnt
i reckon the onfy reason ebenezer
didnt talk was that he was afraid wed
put him to work night herdin like he
heard billy wilson threaten every
other way he was just like a human

  well sir spring come along an the
grass got green an long around spring
round-up time we begun to expeck old
man wrightd come up an pay us a
visit one day when we come in we
see a buckboard standin in the yard
an a parasol against the side o the
door so we knowed old man wright
an his daughter miss evie had come
up together like they sometimes done
when sandy seen this he wanted to
run away sandy he was plumb gone
on miss evie an he knowed it wasnt
no use spite of all the nice stories hed
read in the magazines bout cow-punch-
ers marryin the boss daughter we
was all standin laughin at sandy when
all at onct we heard from the inside
o the shack somebody a-sayin in a
large deep voice sort o giggling too
george now you stop you tickle

  well when we heard them words
we all wanted to run away now
wasnt that a strange thing fer to hap-
pen in a law-abidin cow camp like
ours here we are standin in the sun-

shine boss buckboard in the yard miss
evies parasol against the door an a
voice that aint miss evies sayin them
words we all begun to think maybe
the camp was hanted after all

  billy wilson he walks over toward
the winder an he looks in then a grin
comes on his face an he puts his hand
on his mouth to keep from hollerin
we all looked in then there settin
on the only chair we had was a large
strong female lady with a bonnet an
a linen duster evident ol man wright
an miss evie had gone somewhere an
left this lady here an she had set
down bein tired an went to sleep

  from a hasty glance at this lady
takin in several seasons which she
probably had knew i could not have
suspected her o bein light an frivo-
lous  but at the same time i could see
some sort o reason an explanation fer
happy dreams ebenezer was settin
on the back o this ladys chair laugh-
in to hisself an i reckon them long
whiskers o his was ticklin her ear

   wait a little while says billy
then we all drawed a little ways apart
an stood there a-huggin ourselves an
waitin by and by we heard a shriek
an a sound like somethin heavy fail-
in we knowed then that ebenezer
after his usual fashion had simply been
passin the time o day by stickin his
cold front foot down this ladys neck
-which was some startlin even for us
that was used to it we didnt have
no time to figger though fer out
through the door come this large party
fifty some years old with specs an
gray hair	

   save me hollers she when she
seen us standin there she didnt look
like she was worth it but wre saved
her we explained to her that ebe-
nezer wasnt nothin no more harmful
than just a pet coon an takin her
back in the house we showed her
ebenezer hisself which now was layin
in my bunk pretendin he was asleep
lookin bored that camed the lady
down some

   did i say anything ast she

   no maam says us

  right soon now ol man wright
eftenezecr



come in miss evie with him an i
taken him to one side an ast him who
this party was

   curly says the ol man to me i
couldnt help it an it aint my fault
ef i couldnt prove a alibi that lady
is the reverend mrs reginald jones-
valentine from colorado says he an
shes one o them permanent ladies that
goes in fer sufferage an temperance
an everything else that men dont like
i didnt ask her to come along but she
just got in the buckboard with me an
evie an she talked a arm offen me all
the way up from billings-said she
heard i had the most depraved lot o
punchers up here in the birch creek
country-an i reckon thats right too
says ol man wright to me but how
kin i help it shes come out here
to uplift you all says ol man wright
but dont blame me i told her it was
hopeless

   uh-huh says i fine aint it
colonel as ef we didnt have to stand
enough to earn our forty-five a month
without this sort o thing says i but
then i told ol man wright about ebe-
nezer an mrs reginald well sir
he fell down on the ground an laughed
fer ten minutes straight when he
come to he seemed to have a sort o
idear in his head

   curly says he you watch your
boss now here is where the uplift
begins on birch creek then he calls
miss evie out to where he was at an
tells her to go an git the basket from
outen under the buckboard seat

   evie says he its nigh bout din-
ner time an i want you to mix up
fer your paw an these young men one
o your justly famous punches-the
sort which makes our place so popular
o afternoons to the billings ladies
society fer savin o the heathen make
it good an strong evie an have
a-plenty ef you aint got no punch
bowl take the dishpan

  miss evie she gits busy with the
basket an digs out lemon an sugar
an canned pineapple an things an
she uncorks a couple o bottles an
sends me fer some water an before
long she has a dishpanful o something

that smelled so much like peace an joy
that even ol ebenezer quits bluffin
about bein asleep he sets up in bed
an looks at the pan same like us other
punchers

   now then says ol man wright
after drinkin a dipperful er so o this
to see ef it was mixed all right you
may go call mrs reginald jones-val-
entine curly says he an tell her din-
ner is ready

  well sir i went over to where the
lady had gone to do some thinkin about
savin us depraved wretches an i told
her respeckful that shed better come
an set up an eat

  well when airs reginald come in
she begun to sniff like a pointer dog
she walks straight up to the dishpan
where miss evie has her bilin o punch
an says she sir what is this

  maam says ol man wright-git-
tin on the other side o the table this
is the punch that has made my sewin
circle famous help yourself

  sir says mrs reginald pointin
with one finger down into the dishpan
this is a insult

   no it aint says miss evie its
a pineapple youve got to have that
its better with oranges too but they
dont come canned

  then they wtas what is knowed as
a tab-leau sir algernon nobody said
nothin fer some time at last the eye
o mrs reginald fell on old ebenezer
which was climin outen his bunk an
headin fer the table you have not
even the intelligence o that pore dumb
brute says she men-vile men-are
the only creatures knowed in nature
which will put a enemy into their
mouths fer to steal away their brains

   maam says billy wilson who
was- standin on one foot kind o
thoughtful excuse me fer i dont
want to make no kind o breaks now
so furs i know-although we have
never asked him none about his past-
ebenezer has never saw a panful o
anything like this before in his whole
life but ill bet you four dollars hell
try to dim in the pan fer thats just
the way i feel


the popular magazine

   depraved young man says she
indignant what you say is both false
 an ridiclous dumb animiles at least
they keeps their purity o heart

   oh well says old man wright
takin another dipperful fer luck mere
assertion aint no argument maam
ast the coon hisself about it

   well sir we all stood around the
festive bowl so to speak an billy an
me we just moved a little ways apart
sos ebenezer could git by he didnt
say nothin but he dim first upon the
bench an then upon the table an
walked straight up to miss evies
punch pan he looked over into it
then he turns an gazes up at me winks
one eye an breaks into the happiest
smile ever seen on anybodys face i
knowed then he come from arkansaw

  now a coon caint take hold o a
tin cup with his hand although he kin
do most anything else we just left
ebenezer alone to figger it out for his-
self he still kep up to be a perfeck
gentleman he reaches over easy an
gentle like an fishes out two pieces
o pineapple an then looks round fer
his washin pan billy he goes an gits
the pan puts it on the table an ebe-
nezer he washes off one piece o pine-
apple after a while he taken a bite
out o it then a idea seems to come
acrost his head he taken a bite out
o the other piece that hadnt been
washed now you could tell easy
enough whether animals kin reason er
not ebenezer he puts down the washed
slice o pineapple on the table an he
devotes hisself exclusive to the one
that aint been washed havin fin-
ished that he strolls over to the punch
pan fer some more we all let him
alone an he repeats this softly till they
wasnt no pineapple left after which
he begun to lick his fingers

   maam says old man wright i
know not what these things may prove
in colorado where you come from but
in wyoming theres only one answer
it aint only man is vile on birch
creek

  well mrs reginald she begins to
argue that pineapples is not strong
drink an that the coon has been de-

ceived thinkin it was a article o food
an that oncet he knowed what he was
up against his instinct would save him
from makin another mistake it was
along in there ebenezer took a hand
in the argument

  well sir i reckon ef there ever
was a coon that had a bright an con-
tented outlook on life it was ebenezer
in about five minutes he just dim
down offen the table an started acrost
the floor toward a chair but seemed
like he couldnt find the chair er else
saw several o them and didnt know
which one to take findin his feet
wasnt any too certain hed sit down
several times an laugh fit to split his
sides at last he clims up on the
chair an put his head against his hand
an im right sure ef hed o been alone
hed o burst into some sort o song

   oh bury him not on a lone prai-
ree says old man wright that
coons on the pay roll from this time
on im a-goin to take him home with
me curly you aint worth it but ill
have to raise your wages five account
c o d-coon on delivery

  well o course the old man was
boss an we boys couldnt say much
an he did take ebenezer home with
him too fer twonrrths they wasnt
anybody said a word at that cow camp
an they come pretty near bein a killin
every time anybody locked crossways at
any one else we missed old ebenezer
just that much life didnt seem the
same no more

  o course old man wright didnt
start home that day an we had more
reason fer to see that ebenezer was
shore human the next mornin his
jag was all gone an he was broke an
his hair pulled his eyes was red an
his temper was somethin awful he
even bit me-his warmest personal
friend-when i tried to take aiolt o
him an he was the sourest ugliest
meanest-dispositioned party in that
wrhole camp remorse  that was
him

  did it reform him not to notice
sost to mention well sir algernon
from that time on long as ebenezer
was with us so fur from bein uplifted
ebenbzbcr



he didnt keep his eyes nowhere cept
on the dishpan it was hung on a nail
against the wall an hed climb up on
the bench an raise one aidge o it an
peek under it an smell at the rim of
it an then turn around an look at us
an go an stand up on his hind legs in
front o miss evie an just beg her to
load up the pan again fer him hu-
man  why o course he was human

  what become of ebenezer why
he was fer a long time the delight o
the ladies missionary society down to
billings where he always lent a hand
in the uplift not that mrs reginald
was there-she couldnt leave wyom-
ing too soon an i heerd tell later she
said there was somethin in the climate
o birch creek that was depravin even
to dumb beasts now it wasnt the
climate-it was just human nature

  we fellers kep on eatin what we
could git an drinkin everything there
was when it come along an you
couldnt o killed any one o us with a
ax no more you couldnt ebenezer
neither hes still a member o old
man wrights family in good an regu-
lar standin miss evie watches him
to see that he dont git in wrong with
the booze same as any lady ought to
watch a man onct in a while ebe-
nezer ef they dont watch him he
strolls off down the street an into the
lone star an he climbs up on the bar
an orders hisself a drink like any other
puncher-i told you the only reason
animiles drinks water is theyre mostly
where they cant git nothin else 

  o course too much o this aint
good fer ebenezer so when he comes
home too much lit up--why miss evie
she boxes his ears an scolds him an
puts him to bed an next mornin wraps

his haid up in a wet towel im tellin
you sir algernon that miss evie girls
goin to make some feller a mighty fine
wife

  die why  ebenezer aint ever
goin to die he -national an he plays
the only safe systvu-he eats anything
an everything when he kin git it an
he drinks the same recognizin the
guidin hand o the boss that dont al-
low him to do that last only onct in a
while thats why you cant kill coons
ner cow-punchers-they dont never
die did you ever see a dead coon that
hadnt been shot full o holes er run
over by a train yet that is just how
coons is when you come to study em

  same time you take a lot o your
friends sir algernon thats worryin
about their diet an wonderin whether
theres typhoid in the water an weigh-
in how much they ought to eat fer
breakfast an troublin theirselves
about mi-crobes-well you just watch
an see what good friends they are of
people who make a livin engravin
things on headstones ebenezer he
dont need none he has his lovin
friends an every time we go out with
the beef cut us fellers pays him a visit
down to billings an buys him a few
drinks when miss evie aint watchin
hes the humanest coon ever was
though hes still silent on why he came
to wyoming

  all of which shows sir algernon
concluded curly gathering up his
whitefish that people oughtnt to kick
on their vittals me-im believin that
these here little fish with plenty o
creek water will make us about the
best meal ever was-unlessn it was
that one miss evie begun with the dish-
pan

    the beautiful senorita again this time charming an american soldier and
bidding him turn traitor to his country does love go so far as that not
according to the ethics of kirby rae but the senorita ynes ybarra is not only
a beautiful woman she is wealthy and has a great cause at heart-the reclaim-
ing of the philippines from the americans when a woman of her type com-
mands she expects to be obeyed and after ail rae is a man as well as a
soldier it is a big human-lnterest story well worth the reading

in two parts-part 

a breeze had blown up from the
pasig and from the bay send-
ing the gray clouds scurrying
before the face of the moon to
reflect frosted silver on the water
lights lights myriads of lights meta-
morphosed the luneta into a ribboned
line of soft radiance twisting and turn-
ing along the waterside bands were
playing at scattered points of the great
nocturnal playground and from all
parts of yntramuras came those who
would listen look and be observed
came in victorias carromatas quelises
on horseback on foot it was before
the day of the motor in the islands and
no raucous ear-splitting note of horn no
fuming and puffing or wafted odor of
gasoline disturbed the placidity of the
tropic scene

  kirby rae looked upon it all and
found it good smiling happily occa-
sionally glancing down to see the reflec-
tion of the lights upon his brand-new
leather puttees the glint of his gilded
constabulary buttons it was his first
night in manila his first day in uniform
and he was uplifted with a sense of ro-
mance of adequacy to meet the new
conditions that surrounded him by

stretching a point one might call kirby
rae a man but he as yet lacked three
months of his legal right to that title
certain it was however that he was a
very manly youngster and attractive to
female eyes in his new uniform topped
by closely cut crisp brown hair under
his gold-eagled cap his ingenuous en-
joyment reflected from his laughing
blue eyes

  there goes the governor said his
companion a bronzed somewhat hard-
featured and dissipated man perhaps
five years kirbys senior he added
under his breath some expletives not
particularly flattering to the officials
ancestry general habits and appear-
ance

  kirby rae repeated the name with
somewhat bated breath

  him  he asked ungrammatically

  sure confirmed his companion
with a prophecy as to the governors fu-
ture state

  the boy stared at him in sheer amaze-
ment

  thats a funny way to talk about the
governor he said and his tones were
not well pleased

  when youve been in the islands as
the inn of the seven sins



long as i have and have had to put up
with a government thats all for the
brown man and nothing for the white-
when you realize that its all because
one big fat man is playing to the gallery
at home i guess youll feel the same
way son

  whats he done mr lyle asked
the boy

  lyle who wore the insignia of a first
lieutenant of constabulary shrugged his
shoulders and spread his palms

  lets forget him he said this is
a great night son

  isnt it agreed kirby rae delight-
edly taking a deep breath

  now it seemed that the great circle
of open land was one enormous play-
ground of lights for the carriages were
pouring out of all the calles that opened
on the square lights yellow white
green red as their owners tastes in
colors might incline soldiers in khaki
swaggered past and officers in white
drill sailors blue-bloused pop-eyed
flat-nosed filipinos in misfit two-piece
attire barefooted smoking placidly
lean close-cropped spaniards in pongee
clothes red cummerbunds about their
waists half and quarter-castes-called
mestizas-in such costumes as their
tastes and pocketbooks might provide-
weird for the most part in their com-
bination of european and oriental at-
tire parsees jews chinese lascars-a
sprinkling of all nations a touch of all
national traits and over all the chang-
ing lights from poles and carriages

  in the latter were women ranging
from  the pure-blooded thick-lipped
filipino through the various combina-
tions of filipino chinese spanish and
portuguese to the race-proud senorita
or dona of unmixed castilian descent
and the wives daughters and sisters of
the american military and merchants
in costumes varying from the hunched-
up low-cut bodices of pina and jusi
cloth to the latest mode in white lacy
stuff from paris vienna or new york
-all mysterious and tropically femi-
nine in the swift play of lights and
moon with the swinging refrain of the
music from the band stands to suggest
a background of love and romance

  lyle the elder constabulary officer
seemed to know the people of the lu-
neta as kirby rae knew those of his
little maryland town saluting army and
constabulary officers hailing civilians
by their first names speaking with
grave courtesy to spaniards and span-
ish mestizos and bowing and smiling
gallantly to women of all races in the
carriages pointed out personages whose
names kirby had held in awe treating
them lightly after the manner of the
orient telling little anecdotes wthich
had to do with their failings

  it was in the crush around the second
band stand that kirby became sepa-
rated from lyle and not finding him
sat down on a bench near by and
watched the circling crowds but al-
though the atmosphere was languorous
it yet had motion and one did not sit
long inactive the swaying of the
music sent kirbys feet to pattering
and after a while he arose hardly con-
scious of his action and wandered to-
ward the carriages although he knew
no one among the crowds he was filled
with the radiant joy of youth in a
strange interesting land and he turned
a cheery smiling face and a pair of
laughing eyes to men and women alike
finding companionship in their mere
presence about him

  the harmony of lights moon music
and magic night was suddenly dis-
rupted while he wandered there came
to his ears the thud-thud of beating
hoofs the crowd in the roadway
melted away he heard shouts of
warning and looking up found himself
alone on the beaten carriage path two
great eyes of yellow bearing down rap-
idly upon him back of them he heard
a womans frightened scream a com-
monplace enough thing after all he de-
cided but one apt to prove serious-a
woman in a runaway carriage so far
the roadway had been clear ahead
carromatas and quelises victorias and
pony carts were in the act of being
wildly disentangled from the crush
about the band stand for the run-
away to plunge into that mass meant
deadly danger for all concerned there
were many women there-arid evident-


the popular magazine

ly there was a woman in the head-loose
carriage

  he had been in close touch with
horses all his life at four he had rid-
den bareback as captain of the cavalry
troop at his military school he had es-
tablished a record for putting his boy
troopers through difficult equestrian
maneuvers the mere matter of stop-
ping a runaway did not therefore oc-
cur to him as either a difficult or dan-
gerous thing to do

  he stepped to the side of the road-
way crouching measuring his distance
the pony with dilated eyes and blow-
ing nostrils plunged toward him rat-
tling the light cart after it kirby made
ready for the spring and as the mares
head came level with his he launched
himself forward gripping the shaft on
the far side with one hand fumbling
for the bit with the other

  the pony reared in air dragging
kirby raes feet from the ground at
the same moment kirby threw a leg
over the mares back and caught the
bit rein on either side drawing her
mouth up and up until her nose pointed
almost directly at the moon

  the pony came to a whinnying furi-
ous stop twisting in pain trying to
snap with her great white teeth but
kirby rae his knees pressed into the
heaving sides strained at the bit rein
inch by inch working his way over the
ponys back to the tail and then loos-
ing suddenly stepped to the right shaft
and over the dashboard and as he sat
down in the seat held the reins taut
again

  not looking at the woman at his side
nor hearing the admiring cheers from
the assembled crowd he kept his eyes
directly at the ponys head easing up
and tightening the lines as the beasts
temper seemed to warrant

  i imagine madam he said that
you had better allow me to take you
home the mare is frightened and
you would not be able to manage her
besides i imagine it is embarrassing to
you to be made so conspicuous

  quite-so-sefior she gasped
speaking in english and quite correct-
ly but with a creamy roundness of ex-

pression which was foreign peculiarly
latin but i cannot allow you to so
inconvenience yourself-

  madam said kirby rae still not
seeing her and speaking in the old-
fashioned southern manner inherited
from his father a gallant of antebellum
days it is the duty of every gentleman
to assist a lady in distress and if you
will allow me that pleasure i will be
most happy

  he did not wait for her permission
but turned the mares head out of the
crush and let her drop into a canter
swift but absolutely regulated by him
once the pony shied and had a taste of
a firm hand on the lines several times
she tried to bolt and on both occasions
suffered punishment therefor in the
few minutes that elapsed between
kirbys last speech and his glimpse of
the lady the mare found she was mas-
tered and like a sensible equine tried
no more tricks loping along in the man-
ner her driver thpught best for her
with-the strain of the ladys safety re-
moved from his mind kirby rae
turned his head to her and his eyes
took in dazedly the full measure of her
loveliness

  rae knew little of women apart from
those who had been his friends from
earliest infancy his military-school
experience had been near the place of
his birth and at the dances and small
affairs he met just the same people
coming across the continent and on
board the linr-a small one-which
had brought him from san francisco
to manila there had been no women of
any particularly attractive qualities he
had beeli too busy too sanely and boy-
ishly healthy heretofore to feel the need
of love besides he had a mother he
adored and two sisters to advise and
then there was study care of his horse
drilling his troop football baseball and
riding with the hounds

  therefore having no experience with
women as has been said before it can-
not be written that he enjoyed the situ-
ation in which he now found himself
nor that he knew how to cope with it
he knew that he was blushing and
hated himself for it all the certainty
thb inn of thb sevbn sins



and resolution he had displayed in han-
dling the runaway left him and on his
face a stern look and a conciliatory
smile battled with one another forming
a combination absolutely boyish and
helpless

  you have been very brave senor
said the girl for now it was apparent
she was hardly more than that

  oh its n-nothing he stammered
and turned his eyes to the horse not
so fast he added growling at the pony
when a growl was not in the least neces-
sary

  nothing to have saved my life she
protested laying a hand on his arm
timidly

  i-i didnt mean that of-of course
senorita

  without really wishing to do so he
found himself looking into her eyes
again those eyes he gasped

  what beautiful eyes you have he
blurted out then becoming suddenly
inspired and forgetting his shyness and
surroundings what beautiful beauti-
ful eyes do you know what they
make me think of  night in the for-
est and deep pools in the black sedge
with ever so many brown leaves at the
bottom and the stars shining through
just a little break in the branches of the
trees overhead

  the girl clasped her hands her ges-
ture as natural as his own outburst

  senor senor-that is poetry she
said

  he had no words for a minute or
two then he asked prosaically

  which way please

  she indicated the course the pony
was to take

  my name is kirby rae senorita
he explained as he drew in the near
rein slightly altering the direction of
the pony and i am an inspector-or
lieutenant of constabulary

  i knew that senor she said and
you come from the big military acad-
emy--

  oh no not west point he told
her if i had gone through that i
should be an army officer my people
didnt have the influence to get me
there so they did the best they could

and sent me to a little military academy
near my home-rockhurst that is in
maryland do youknow about mary-
land 

  that is where they have tobacco
isnt it she asked i have seen in
paris packets of cigarettes with mary-
land upon them

  why yes he agreed i believe
they do have tobacco

  and black men picking it with
chains around their ankles she con-
tinued oh yes i know your mary-
land senor and at night they play on
the-what you call guitars-no-jo-
jos-

  banjos laughed rae yes i
reckon some of them still do but
youre thinking about slave days-that
was long ago when the darkies were
happy and contented and used to work
-before they set them free

  just as did these filipinos before
the american pigs came and put false
notions in their silly heads she cried
indignantly then with a little fright-
ened oh touched his arm with gen-
tle fingers

  oh senor may i ever be forgiven
you are american and i have forgot
but i did not think of you being ameri-
can you are good you would not
steal from churches or teach filipino
dogs to hound the spanish because they
are beaten men and you do not speak
as do the americans senor-with the
strange nose talk and hard scratchy
voice-

  oh youre thinking of the yan-
kees explained rae tolerantly but
they are not all the people of america
i am a southerner-you know

way down south in the land of cotton
cinnamon top and sandy bottom

     look away---

  dixie land that is well im from
dixie

  dee-see she repeated slowly dee-
see that is pretty i think i am glad
then that you are not a yankee my
cousin does not like them he is span-
ish and much older than i am and he
is my guardian he is senor don am-
brosino de rufelo and i am ynes
ybarra


the pcpuljcr magazine

  she spelled it carefully for him
e-e-nays e-e-bar-ra he pro-
nounced just as carefully i think
that is a charming name-and so differ-
ent from any i ever heard then you
are the senorita ynes arent you

  he was somewhat anxious now

  oh yes sehor rae she laughed
i am still a senorita-although i am
almost as old as are you but you see
she added as though in apology i
have been to schools in england and
france and i have spent many years in
paris with my cousin

  the pony cart swerved out of the
street and into the luneta again

  weve been going around in a cir-
cle said rae somewhat ruefully

  i meant that we should she said
clapping her hands and laughing softly
let us remain here for a while draw
up the bad pony there an open space
-see she appears to be gentle and
tractable under your strong hands
well he admitted not without
some pride i am rather strong you
know

  he brought the cart into the desired
position

  tell me senor she said abruptly
tell me of yourself you-you are
very young to be out here and you
must have much to tell

  he welcomed the opportunity
well you see he complied i am
young but then i have had a military
education i was trained for a soldier
just as they train west point men i
was studying civil engineering when
this chance came i heard of this con-
stabulary outfit which was just like a
colonial army and i took the civil-serv-
ice examination and passed with quite
a good average i got an appointment
almost immediately-and it was inspec-
tor second grade too-that is second
lieutenant i didnt have to go into the
lowest grade at all of course mother
and sister ada and sister alice didnt
want me to come out here they think
its a wild sort of place with people
lurking behind every corner to take a
shot at you but i told them that dad
and granddad had been soldiers and
that i felt i wanted to be nd now that

i had the chance i was going to take it
-although of course i hated to leave
them behind and i had a jolly trip as
soon as i got over being homesick this
is my first day in manila i like it
you are going to live here she
asked

  dont know dont reckon so after
they get me whipped into shape theyll
send me away off to some little place i
suppose

  you should come to melangete she
said softly

  he repeated the name puzzled
melangete she repeated thats
on the island of minegnay-min-e-gni
its not a large island just to the south
of panay and negros-one of the vis-
ayan group that is where my fathers
estates are and it is where i am going
to go

  g-go when

  i do not know she replied her
narrowed eyes viewing him and flash-
ing golden light

  not soon he begged

  well she smiled maybe-not

soon- she broke off suddenly

  and now she said you must
drive me to the casa senor rae it is
growing late the band has ceased to
play ahead

  and you will let me call at your
casa soon

  si senor i shalj believe myself
very lacking in attraction if you do not
come

  to-morrow

  she laughed to-morrow rf you-
wish senor-if you wish and i shall
have tea for you after the english fash-
ion-at four and you shall meet my
cousin don ambrosino although he
likes americans little still he cannot
lack castilian courtesy and he must be
grateful to the american who saved
his little cousin from death-ugh

  she shuddered

  how strong how brave-

  he turned looking into her eyes

  --and how young you are

  you are young too senorita he re-
minded her

  for the first time her golden-brown
the inn of the seven sins



eyes were dull dull as is the sun
through a mist

  nineteen in years senor-a hun-
dred and nineteen in experience and
-old enough to be your grandmother
she was laughing again

 they had driven up and across
streets and now she indicated an arch-
way on calle sta ana through which
the pony now glided within two
servants in rope sandals shuffled for-
ward one carrying a lantern the other
taking the ponys head

  dios be thanked senorita said the
one with the lantern we have shiv-
ered and shaken with fear since first
you drove forth with this mare of the
devils own brood

  devils mare for devils daughter
she returned lightly in spanish

  rae swung down and his cap fell
not regarding it he put up a hand and
helped her to the ground then as a
man does when bareheaded passed his
fingers through his hair smoothing it
up from his forehead and incidentally
revealing a brown birthmark which
had the shape of a cross inverted the
man holding the lantern catching sight
of it drew back his lips baring his
teeth a frozen yell in his mouth the
lantern clattered to the ground

  el diablo dagorro he muttered
and dropped on his knees before kirby
rae catching at his putteed legs

  rae turned a puzzled face to the girl
who in turn poured out a string of ques-
tions at the kneeling man he answered
briefly she picked up the lantern and
holding it up to raes face pushed back
his hair at the sight of the birthmark
her eyes dilated

  senor she said keep always your
hair down upon your forehead show
that mark never it is dangerous show

it never-never-

  she switched to spanish speaking to
the monos

  as for you swear to me now you
will tell to no one that you have seen a
stranger with the mark swear
trembling they complied

  get you then into the cart she said
to the one holding the ponys head and
b

drive the senor to his casa buenas
noches senor rae

  she gave him her hand he bent
over kissing it

  to-morrow at four

  at four

ii

  ynes ybarra did not immediately en-
ter the house waiting smiling until the
sound of wheels and ponys hoofs had
died away her face seemed very young
in the moonlight her figure slight and
girlish and in her eyes and about her
lips was a tenderness that glorified her
beauty for some little while she stood
there her hand on the marble balus-
trade her eyes turned to the moon

  then she sighed and pushed open a
glass-paned door entering a lofty-ceil-
inged room lighted cathedrallike by a
six-sprayed candelabrum on the teak-
wood table by which sat two men con-
versing in low tones one rose at her
entrance coming forward and offering
his hand-a man above the average in
height squarely built broad-shouldered
his blue eyes were in marked contrast
to his intensely black hair and they had
in them a certain contemptuous reck-
lessness that provoked curiosity where
it did not attract one reckoned him a
soldier a hard drinker a harder fighter
not particularly scrupulous concerning
the means to a desired end he stag-
gered a bit and his full round face was
pouchy under the eyes the skin there
being somewhat discolored otherwise
his complexion was good

  miss inez he said pronouncing the
name after the english fashion i have
been dragging out my stay with your
cousin here hoping you would come in
before i went

  the girl yawned putting up pink fin-
ger tips to hide it

  i am sorry captain greenough
she returned that i am too sleepy to
entertain you

  his eyes were free of contempt now
but the recklessness was allied with a
somewhat conscious admiration

   twas just to have another look at
your face miss inez he said the


the popular magazine

same that i have not seen since two
months past when we dined at the rltz
this is different from paris eh

  one was undecided whether he was
english or irish by his speech his in-
tonation was distinctively the former
but he used the construction of the lat-
ter in places as a matter of fact he
was both guy desmond greenough-
pronounced gren-uff-the son of a pen-
niless third son of an english peer by
a dublin doctors daughter thirty-seven
in years a man without a country a
mercenary who had fought under many
flags and whose last appointment had
been in the french foreign legion sta-
tioned in algeria a post from which he
had resigned it was said under circum-
stances involving a womans name and
reflecting upon him no particular credit

  i am tired said ynes ybarra and
am going to my room immediately

  you have been driving he asked

  the man who had remained seated at
the girls entrance now looked up for
the first time he was gaunt bronzed
forty at least with eyes deeply sunken
uncannily black eyes so black indeed
that the outline of the pupils was lost
there was a queer inward look in them
and now as he turned them toward
ynes it seemed that he was gazing past
instead of at her

  you drove alone he said and
drove the most unmanageable pony in
the stables his voice held a reproof

  yes she replied indifferently

  and you were not alone when you
returned he continued

  good night captain greenough
she said ambrosino intends to quar-
rel with me and i do not wish you to
see him humbled he will not learn it
is unwise to match words with a wom-
an

  she held out her hand to greenough
who raised it toward his lips she sud-
denly jerked it away

  not that she said

  why he asked surprised

  as she could not very well tell him
it was because another man had kissed
that same hand but a few moments be-
fore she only shrugged her shoulders

  a fancy

  a beautiful woman is permitted as
many fancies as she chooses said
greenough and the woman who was
the three years toast of paris more
but fancies sometimes run to the oppo-
site extreme i trust i shall be here at
the time

  she had never noticed before that his
smile was odious

  there will be no such antithetical
fancy while you are here captain
greenough she said cruelly good
night and pardon our lack of hospital-

  it was the britons turn to shrug his
shoulders which his irish blood per-
mitted him to do effectively shaking
hands with don ambrosino and bow-
ing low to the girl he went out

  ynes turned her eyes to the black-
eyed man who sat caressing his closely
cut black beard with bony blue-veined
fingers

  you were saying ambrosino-

  that you drove alone an unmanage-
able horse and returned with an un-
known man

  yes

  you find that in accord with the pro-
prieties 

  i find whatever i do to my liking
she returned slowly and i tell you
now never to use that tone of reproof
to me again when another person is
present and be very sparing in the
use of it even when we are alone i am
no child ambrosino you have made
me a woman of the world perhaps i
may remind you rather forcibly that
your great scheme is dependent upon
my money and that if i choose to with-
draw my financial support it crumples
you speak as though the scheme
were for my own betterment he said
in heavy anger turning his eyes now
glittering to her

  she laughed the day is over when
you hold any power in those eyes to
keep me subservient she said those
were the days before i knew my own
power now i know what may be done
with my wealth and that at the age of
eighteen i became my own mistress to
do with it as i choose i do not care to
remind you of this ambrosino but
the inn of the seven sins



your own attitude has forced me to it
so long as you are content to be my
cousin and my equal and not my guard-
ian and superior you will find me agree-
able but under other circumstances i
must remind you that you are no more
than a hired employee

  her voice had a hard metallic ring to
it there was in it no trace of the soft
shrinking girlish person who had sat
in the pony cart with kirby rae

  ambrosino turned his eyes from her
i respect your wishes ynes he said
you are right but the plan he
added that is- your own as much as
mine you hate these americans as
much as i do ever since childhood
you have been determined to avenge the
death of manuel the massacre of our
household by filipinos for which the
united states would mete out no pun-
ishment-

  perhaps had you not always fanned
the flame of my hatred i might have

forgotten she said after all-

  she paused

  he passed easily on to another sub-
ject

  you found it difficult to manage the
pony to-night

  the bad beast she exclaimed he
ran away with me had it not been

for the brave senor who aided me-

  her eyes grew tender with the
thought

 ambrosino she said reflectively i
did not know there were such men in
the world he was taller than you and
broader of shoulder his hair was crisp
-not as black as yours-but yet dark
and his eyes were big and round and
gray and as innocent as a childs he
was very strong--

  she paused remembering the ease
with which rae had stopped the tear-
ing runaway the thought thrilled her

  and very young she continued
only a little older than myself he
told me i was beautiful but oh so dif-
ferently from the others and i played
at being a child with him-an inexperi-
enced child-woman ambrosino i dont
remember ever before feeling like that
everything seemed so straightforward
so honest-nothing to hide about him

and i felt quite safe knew the more i
should be in peril the more i could de-
pend upon him he is the sort of man
who would give freely all his life-
prospects wealth services whether his
love be returned or not

  ambrosino drew a long sibilant
breath between his teeth

  you seem my cousin to be on a fair
road to losing that cold little heart of
yours

  perhaps i am she said smiling
contemplatively i hope so there is
something in the air to-night which has
never been there an expectation of the
morrow a thrill of anticipation he
comes to tea at four when he comes
i shall know

  whether he loves you 

  he does love me he will love me
she responded fiercely no i did not
mean that it was whether i should
love him or not i hope i believe i
do

  and he-is american  ambrosino
kept his voice low level

  he is a constabulary lieutenant
she answered then remembering the
note in ambrosinos voice she asked
sharply what of that

  how is it possible for you to love
one whose country you hate  whose
countrys supremacy in these islands
you are in a plot to destroy

  the look on her face showed that she
realized the weight of his words

  for a chance acquaintance you are
to forget the wrong these americans
have done us we rufelos and ybar-
ras once the richest in all the philip-
pines now helpless in our own lands
our crops rotting away for lack of taos
to work them because this cursed sen-
timent of liberty of equality which the
americans have put into the filipinos
has left them useless as laborers we
whom the government will not allow to
import chinese labor to save our crops
our fortunes we who have been forced
to sell estate after estate to american
monopolies for a third a fourth of their
worth we of the proudest blood of
castile reviled spat upon by filipino
dogs who find protection behind ameri-
can arms whose lands have been laid


the popular magazine

waste by ladrones houses burned with
no interference from the americans
you whose own brother died in bilibid
prison because american law put him
there for killing a filipino thief whose
fathers house was ravaged robbed his
servants throats cut-your own nurse
among them you alone of all the old
spanish nobility have the money at your
disposal to aid the cause and you speak
of loving a man of the race who are our

enemies-

  he paused from sheer want of
breath

  i have forgotten nothing ambro-
sino she said slowly forgotten noth-
ing i have not said i intend to aban-
don the scheme we have determined
upon but i will not let love go out of
my life once it has come in to-mor-
row when i see him i will know if i
love him and if i love him he shall
love me-yes love me so much that he
will give up his country for me

  i know these americans said am-
brosino soberly they do not do that
this one will if i love him she
said her golden-brown eyes narrowing
he will give up his country more than
that he will help me against his coun-
try he will love me blindly devotedly
my thoughts will be his thoughts my
ends his ends i will win him over to
our cause and he will be one of us

iii

  ynes ybarra repeated lyle in
some surprise why wherever did
you hear of her son 

  kirby rae blushed wishing mean-
while that he was able to tell a lie with
a straight face

  oh i dont know he replied awk-
wardly i-er-heard some people
talking about her-some spanish people
last night-er-after i lost you

  lyle did not notice his embarrass-
ment he seemed reflective

  been reading the papers eh

  it was evident he had not even heard
the halting mendacious explanation
rae was glad of that

  er-yes he said

  beautiful girl commented lyle

but heartless utterly heartless from
all i can hear refused an american
millionaire a french duke and lord
knows how many others i guess if
ive got one picture of her ive got a
dozen cut em out of the paris maga-
zines and papers she comes from these
dhobi islands by the bye but shes lived
abroad most of her life i know some
people who knew her father and moth-
er fine old spanish family the ybar-
ras used to own pretty much the
whole island of minegnay their es-
tates got all tangled up for a while
some crooked business on the part of
our lovely local judges and she had to
go on the stage made a great hit in
paris with a bolo dance-regular fili-
pino affair played the marigny and
all the swell places wouldnt go near
the moulin rouge or any of the cheaper
ones guess she wasnt more than fif-
teen or sixteen when she first went on
stayed on for two or three years then
they got the estates straighthened out
over here and she proved her right to
her fathers fortune so she cut out the
stage quick as a wink and since then
nobody has heard much about her i
was just reading in a paris paper yes-
terday about her mysterious disappear-
ance-let me see-where is it 

  the two constabulary officers were
seated in lyles room in the barracks
overlooking the courtyard from which
ever and anon came the sound of mili-
tary directions the shuffle of feet the
grounding of rifles as a squad of awk-
ward recruits were being put through
their paces by an ex-sergeant of regu-
lars now a first lieutenant of constabu-
lary  he was irish and profane and
had an extensive vocabulary of exple-
tives and epithets descriptive of disap-
proval extending over the gaelic eng-
lish spanish and tagalog languages

  kirby raes duties for the day were
ended he had spent the morning since
seven oclock in attempting to teach half
a troop of visayans to sit in a mcclel-
lan saddle and gallop in formation
without any particular result except a
very severe trying of his own temper
now at three oclock glowing with an-
ticipation he had been no longer able to
the inn of the seven sins	

                t

keep the name of the girl from his lips
and he had mentionedit tentatively to
lyle

  the elder man after rummaging
through a pile of periodicals and pa-
per-covered books finally unearthed a
quarto-sized weekly with chromo cover
and came across to rae

  there she is he said in tones of
genuine admiration isnt she a
beauty that is if she looks like her
picture

 shes-

  kirby had started to inform him as
to the immense superiority of the real
ynes to the pictured one when he
checked himself as lyle seemed to be
unaware of senorita ybarras presence
in manila it would appear that she had
some reason for keeping it a secret

  he looked at the picture

  beautiful he said adding that
is the one i saw

  he wondered if he looked as uncom-
fortable as he felt

  lets see what does the paper say
lyle squinted at the french of it trans-
lating slowly

  bel ami ynes is gone from among us
and boulevardiers are desolate it was dif-
ficult enough for us to accustom ourselves
to the fact that we should no longer see
her upon the boards for a mere matter of a
few francs but at least we had the con-
solation of noting her upon the bois for
the drive and at the ritz or darmenonville
for an occasional meal but now she has
fled us forsaken us leaving behind no hint
of her destination gone also is the watch-
dog the sullen don ambrosino but-may
we say most significant of all-vanished
entirely is the handsome englishman whose
surname no frenchman may pronounce but
whom the girls of maxims and the cafe
americain know as tres joli guy

   can it be that the senorita has after all
a heart and that this debonair soldier whose
reputation is none of the best even for a
flaneur has touched it for the sake of
bel ami ynes we trust not

  kirby rae was red with anger as
lyle finished

  scandalous sheet he said indig-
nantly

  oh i dont know returned lyle
it doesnt say anything much when a
parisian sheet like this one-he tapped
it-treats a womans name with such

respect and that woman a former
dancer you can bet shes good-good all
the way through for i guess there are
some good women in the world-not
that i know much of them by experi-
ence but somehow that girls face has
always had a funny attraction for me
ive cut out every picture of her i saw
and one of them i liked so much that i
sent to a parisian photographer inclos-
ing money to buy an original he re-
turned the money saying that mademoi-
selle fiad forbidden him to sell her pic-
tures and thats somewhat of a nov-
elty in an actress-eh  id like to meet
her she has great possibilities theres
a soul behind all that beauty-but a soul
that has never been awakened if she
ever loves a man-well hell be lucky

  kirby rae picked up his cap riding
crop and gloves

  yes i reckon he will he said so-
berly well-see you later lieutenant
lyle

  the light had died out of his eyes
and the corners of his boyish mouth
quivered he mounted his pony which
an orderly brought out and let the beast
canter as it willed until he realized he
was going out of his way and turned
its head to the calle sta aha the
house had not been numbered but he
remembered its location and appear-
ance having no difficulty in finding it
the servant who took his ponys reins
evidently had expected him for he
shouted up the steps from the patio and
another muchacho in clean white cotton
clothes came down waving his hand to
the balcony

  with a somewhat dejected air rae
followed the direction to the stone bal-
cony wdiere orchids and other gorgeous
growths grew in the little garden and
was then shown into a room opening off
the balcony where the girls tawny head
caught the sunbeams as she bent over
the silver tea service

  she rose to greet him smiling kirby
flushed and murmured something indis-
tinctly as he took her hand

  you are very punctual she said
for it is not yet four and the tea is not
quite ready

  he murmured apologies which she


the cpocpulficr magazine

waved aside still smiling and imperi-
ously directed him to a seat he took
it watching her and picking nervously
at his gloves she was in a gown of
white lace through which her satiny
skin showed its warm petal-pink olive
a high curved collar of the lace meeting
her hair in back her sleeves short
showing the curves of her arms but
she seemed only a child for all he had
heard-a beautiful willful child as she
bit her under lip frowning and then
drew in the lip smiling and showing
her dimples the different expressions
resulting from her manipulation of the
tea service

  there was a muchacho at hand to
give kirb his cup and the slice of thin
bread and butter and who vanished si-
lently when he had done so

  now she said smiling and nod-
ding at him now i have given you your
tea and have been hospitable we will
talk and you will tell me all about your
maryland where they have the tobacco

and the band-jo-jos and-

  it is very kind of you to let me
come he said i-i appreciate it
awfully senorita

  appreciate wh it is i who ap-
preciate it was i who asked you to
come

  yes he blurted out but you were
grateful because i happened to be lucky
enough to stop that horse last night i
know im nothing but a kid and i reck-
on i bore you-and--everything-

  amigo mioj she said gently i
should not have asked you to come had
i not wished to see you

  oh of course you say that per-
sisted kirby rae unhappily but i dont
know anything about women and dont
know how to talk to them or what to do
or say and im just sort of tongue-tied
and i know i must be an awful bore i
think things but i cant say them i
think beautiful things when i look at
you but i get all choked up in the throat
when i start to tell you about them--

and then-

  why you dear boy she said and
no man on earth had ever heard that
note in her voice before a note that had
all the gentle kindness and loving solici-

tude of a sweet warm-blooded girl
whose pulses for the first time were
stirring who was forgetting self and
thinking only of what she would like to
do to make the lad across the table from
her happy

  you dear boy she continued that
is why i-like you so much because
youre so different from the rest be-
cause you dont know that you are-

  she did not say adorable though it
was on her lips she caught herself in
time

  but he was too absorbed with his own
shortcomings to hear what she said too
modest to recognize the tenderness in
her tone and his eyes being turned away
from her he could not see the radiance
that had overspread her face

  i was reading all about you in a
paris paper he said how famous and
beautiful and how missed you were
and when i think of all the men-well-
knowxn men-who must have wanted to

be with you and how clever they-

  she leaned impulsively over and took
his wrist

  silly boy she said i did not care
as much for all of them as i care about
one of those little waves in your hair
he breathed the rare fragrance of
her and in that moment he considered
nothing thought nothing weighed noth-
ing  but followed blindly the instinct
that told him to catch her in his arms
and she was responsive her lips met
his

  it was not a moment-hardly a sec-
ond  then he was on his feet his eyes
ashamed afraid to meet hers his head
sunk on his breast

  oh senorita senorita he pleaded
oh-forgive me forgive me i was
crazy mad-forgive me forgive me i

did not mean it-i-i-

  her lithe body stiffened her eyes
flamed

  you did not mean it you do not
love me 

  love you  love you  senorita i
-i-love you love you love you-so
much i cant say it oh but i have no
right to tell you and-can you ever
forgive me for-having--done that 
can you- oh you must i-i-
thb inn of thb seven sins

never felt that way about a girl before
and it just came suddenly-before i
realized what i was doing oh i know
its impossible for a girl like you to care
for a-a--just a kifl-like me-but i
-i-dont expect that just let me
come to see you-just once in a while
ill try not to bore you ill-ill do
anything for you-and maybe maybe
this love for you will make me a bigger
man a man more worth while maybe
loving you like this ill be able to do
big things to win you-to make you care

and-

   oh boy she said softly it isnt
what a man does that makes a woman
love him its--something that nobody
understands its because you are you
and i am i and god intended us for
one another that is love even if you
were never to be more than a captain
of constabulary i should love you if
you became the greatest soldier in the
world i could not love you more it is
-you nothing more-you-querido
mio

  you he gasped love-me-

  with all my heart and soul i love
you sweetheart she said and came
forward but as he would have taken
her into his arms she paused warning
him back

  first she said i must know how
much you love me

  flow much 

  he paused his mouth half open then
he smiled with whimsical hopelessness

  i-i-couldnt tell you  that he
said i cant find the words they
come but they seem to mean so little
and my love for you is so big i am
just yours yours and id do anything
everything to prove it oh if i only
could do some big thing to prove it
suppose she said her eyes meeting
his suppose you could suppose i
asked you to give up your country to
prove your love for me-asked you to
resign your commission and work with

  oh do you want me to he asked
eagerly why of course i would
and work against your own country
-against america-the united states



join with me and others to take the

philippines away from them-

  he stared not realizing

  they would call you a renegade a
traitor but i would love you i would
be your wife-yes i would marry you
and be yours all yours never any
others even if you died i would be
yours-you understand would you
be a renegade a traitor and not care so
long as i loved you 

  his lips formed in a tender smile
you are only trying me he said
no woman could love a man who
would be such a dog as that

   would love you i tell you she
cried fiercely because you would be a
renegade for my sake because you
would have given up your country
everything for me i would love you
would not that be enough

  no he said slowly that wouldnt
be love theres a difference between
love-and something else love is
clean and big and pure it makes a man
want to be fit for a woman it makes
him strive not to do the things that
arent right my father often told me
about those things he said there wras
no love where there was not honor
but-and he broke off smiling-i
didnt mean to say all those things
theyre just what i remember of what
my father used to tell me he was a
soldier and they used to call him the

confederate chevalier-he-

  confederate she cried catching at
the word then-then he fought
against the united states-fought
against his country

  the boy shook his head the united
states is all the states he said there
wasnt any united states during the
civil wrar it was north against south
but there is a united states now thank
god-he hushed his voice as he spoke
-and i am an american

  he turned to her trying to take her
hands but she eluded him there wars
a determined glint in her golden-brown
eyes an angry resolve

  suppose i told you she said very
low that unless you renounced your
country and threw in your lot with her


the cpocpulacr magazine

enemies you would never see me
again 

  i should not believe you he re-
turned still smiling

  but it is true-true i tell you i
love you love you shall never love any
other man but you but i have a pur-
pose a mission which must be fulfilled
and i want the love of no man who
does not love me enough to follow me
to aid me so make your choice 
make-my-choice 

between me and your country be-
fore god i mean it see-i swear
she kissed the golden crucifix that
hung from the thin chain about her
neck

  you cannot mean it

  and she noted that for the first time
he had the voice the manner of a man
the boyishness had gone he stood
very straight his nails tearing his palms

  mean it yes yes yes sweet-
heart prove your love-come with
me she stretched out her arms to
him i will make you a great man
i will make others see in you what i
see i will make you famous feared
and envied and no other man shall ever
speak a word of love to me i will be
yours until death if you like when
this plan of ours is consummated we
will leave the philippines-go to
france-take an old chateau and live
among the grapevines and the roses-
just you and i together and be happy
with only the thought of love between
us do you realize how much i love
you querido mio do you realize that
in sickness pain or danger i will be
always with you always thinking of
you dear one it is the only part of
the divine given to us-love and if
you love me as you should you will not
let that love go out of our lives what
is your country your kindred any-
thing compared to the marvelous thing
that springs up like a glowing flowrer
in a wilderness unaided unsought-
love all the while i have lived and
men have told me i was beautiful and
they loved me i could only think them
silly for i saw only their faces and
heard them speak and i wished to see
or hear neither but when i looked at

you the first time-deep down into
your soul-i felt a little child again
happy over trifles glad to be alive
and all last night i lay awake refusing
sleep because the thought of you was
too beautiful to lose my dear one do
not refuse me i have not loved be-
fore i will never love again come
with me do as i would have you
do

  senorita-ynes cried the boy
desperately you do not mean that
you wish me to become a traitor to my
country you cant mean it i wont
believe it a traitor

  but true to me-to me

if i were false to my country i
could not be true to you could not be
true to any one or anything i would
be lower than the thief the murderer
and you refuse

  to be a traitor i would not sink
so low as to think i even considered it
then go she said i dont want
love like yours-love that sets another
thing higher than the one woman per-
haps-perhaps-i did not mean what
i said about sacrificing your country
but the thought that you should refuse
-refuse that is enough to prove you
do not love me and i want you to go-
to go-and to never see me again

  but kirby rae was no longer the
gentle-mannered boy all the softness
had fled from lips and eyes he faced
her with a look in his eyes that set her
shrinking back for the moment afraid

  and i he said will not go you
have said you love me to try my love
you have proposed a thing so vile that
i cannot believe you realize it you
have said you love me and i choose to
believe that you do

  he caught her wrists so tightly that
she was powerless

  you shall love me he said your
life is my life i shall never give you
up-never-now that you have told me
of your love

  she raised her voice suddenly in a
scream

  let me go let me go love-
pah you know nothing of it-noth-
ing-nothing go  i hate you  go-
go
the inn of the seven sins



  and i say you shall love me he
said from behind clenched teeth love
me as your very life itself-love me
now and all the time i say you shall
never love any one else that the touch
of another man shall be hateful to you
his kiss an insult his love a mockery i
alone shall be the man you love

  as his head went back his hair fell
from his temple exposing the little in-
verted cross on his forehead gleaming
red now against his dead-white skin
again she screamed and this time the
scream was answered the door was
flung violently open aiid greenough
came into the room at the sight of
the girl struggling in kirby raes grasp
he came forward and with an abrupt
angry movement he caught kirbys
shoulders pressed his knee into the
small of the boys back and broke his
hold

  ye cur he shouted

  rae turned on him an ugly smile on
one side of his mouth his teeth show-
ing white his fist swung hammerlike
and struck greenough on the point of
his jaw the adventurer staggered
slipped fell but as he reached the
floor he reached for his hip and the
black barrel of a gun showed omi-
nously

  the second of his drawing howrever
had been identical with kirbys spring
and the two men came within an inch
of each other when greenough fired
a scream from the girl a long-drawn
hisslike sound from kirby rae and the
bullet went into the ceiling thanks to
kirbys sudden striking up of the re-
volver a struggle ensued for the pos-
session of the weapon kirby catching
greenoughs hand and holding it high
in air his fingers pressing hard the
small bones of the adventurers wrist
his left hand gripping his throat he
was taller longer of arm than green-
ough and there was a table between
them which prevented greenoughs
kicking his arms could not reach
kirby and the constabulary officer his
teeth close together held the older man
at arms length his steellike fingers
burying themselves into gullet and
wrist greenoughs face became pur-

ple his eyes bulged the revolver
dropped from his hand and rae re-
leased the man and pushed him into a
panting heap on the floor

  you murdering dog he said and
picked up the revolver

  again the girl screamed shrilly and
her trembling lingers tugged at his
shoulders

  no no no she cried he is the
man i love-

  she had misinterpreted kirbys pur-
pose imagined he was about to fire at
the man on the floor she did not
know that such things were forbidden
anglo-saxons that kirby rae had
struggled for the revolver not because
he wished to kill greenough but be-
cause he had no desire that greenough
should make an end of him but per-
haps she had another purpose at the
back of her angry feminine mind-the
desire to hurt hurt cruelly the man
who had flung her love aside because
of a matter of duty

  her words recalled kirby rae had
he continued in his rage he might by
sheer force of his primitive strength
and lack of fear have brought the girl
to the point where nothing mattered
except him where from desiring him
to join the cause in which she was the
moving spirit she might come to will-
ingly follow wherever he led but the
whiplash of her words had been as ef-
fective as a spray of cold water upon a
drunken man his anger fell away
from him and the hardness of cheek
mouth and jaws relaxed into the curv-
ing lines of a boys face again he
turned eyes to her as helpless as a
wounded dog

  ynes he said

 go the one word was like a
death sentence

  he went out bareheaded leaving
cap gloves and crop behind him in
the silence that followed she stared
stonily at greenough who had pulled
himself painfully to his feet and was
smiling upon her from a distorted face
he caught her hand quite suddenly
she shrank away horror in her gaze

  the touch of another man shall be


the popular magazine

hateful to you she quoted dully
warning him off with upraised hands

  but either greenough did not hear
or he did not understand he caught
her in his arms

  one kiss inez darling he said
one kiss and then im off to finish
that hound

  she wrenched herself free from him
you hurt him she said you
there was scornful merriment in her
tone and she repelled his advance
dont touch me she breathed
but you said you loved me
because i thought he was going to
kill you and because i wanted to hurt
him love you why i love him-
a man worth a dozen of you a man
clean upright honorable a strong man
but gentle and chivalrous to women a
man who would sacrifice a great love
because he would not betray his coun-
try a man indeed-and the man i
love dont touch me-you

  her eyes fell on kirby raes cap
crop and gloves which he had left be-
hind she caught a glove and carried
it to her lips and with the action lost
herself in a paroxysm of tears fleeing
from- greenoughs presence up the
stairs and to her own room where she
flung herself on her bed her slender
body shaking convulsively

  i love him-i love him she wailed
oh i must bring him back tell him
i did not mean wrhat i said oh dear
one come back to me i wont want
you to be a renegade ill be an ameri-
can like you ill give up all my plans
to hurt your country ill do nothing

you do not wish ill-

  as a thought flashed into her head
she sat suddenly erect the tears ceased
to flow her eyes became absorbed
meditative considering then they
brightened beamed and she ran to re-
move the traces of grief soaking a
towel and rubbing it over her face a
dry towel a touch of powder a pin-
point of rouge on her cheeks now
deathly pale and she was arranging her
hair with deft pats hurriedly she
thrust several jeweled hatpins through
a lace hat drew on white gloves caught
up a lacy sunshade and gathering up

her skirts raced down the steps to the
balcony and the patio

  mr redmond morrisonattorney at
law legally certified by the civil gov-
ernment as competent to practice his
profession in the city of manila was
lying full length upon a rattan couch in
the far corner of his office his white
tunic unbuttoned at the throat and
showing a liberal amount of bare neck
and thin undershirt he was dictating
a letter to his filipino typewriter in-
tended for his mother in wuaskegon
wisconsin a siphon a bottle of
scotch and a box of cigarettes were
within easy reach and redmond pe-
rused the manila sunday sun during
the interval of sentences

  si senor said the typewriter look-
ing up expectantly

   t am writing this with my left
hand because my right one is unfortu-
nately disabled from a bad gunshot
did you get that

  si senor grinned the typewriter
in sheer delight at such charming men-
dacity

   they have insisted on my remain-
ing in the hospital until the wound has
healed  dictated mr morrison re-
turning to his perusal of the periodical
and after an interval they are
afraid blood poisoning will set in if i
am exposed to any but the pure air of
the hospital premises  he spelled out
the last word  the wound i re-
ceived during an attack on manila by
the insurrectos a frequent occurrence
but one seldom fraught-f-r-a-u-g-h-t

-with ill con sequences- 

  the filipino typewriter grinning
admiringly pecked away at the keys
mr morrison reached out the disabled
right hand-which showed neither
wound nor scar-and struck a match
which he applied to a fresh cigarette
becoming absorbed in his work of fic-
tion he dropped the sun and thought
hard
the inn of the seven sins



   i was in the front of the fight 
he continued  bullets raining all about
me the standard bearer of the four-
fifty-ninth was shot down and the flag
trailed the dust i rushed forward and
picked it up a bullet entered my hand
but i knew that the day would be lost if
the flag went down i held it aloft the
blood streaming from my hand the
soldiers cheered and pushing on drove
the insurrectos back the day was
saved

   therefore dear mother having in-
curred this wound in the service of my
country they offer to keep me at the
hospital free of charge but i am not
one to accept services for what i have
done for my native land and i have re-
fused but as my law practice is sus-
pended while i am laid up i will need
money badly when i come out of the

hospital andso if you will cable-

  senor senor protested the type-
writer who had long ago given up any
attempt to follow the rapid stream of
words

  confound you sanchez growled
mr morrison reaching for the scotch
you spoiled an inspired flow

  there was a knock on the door out-
side

  if its mr saunders or anybody i
know well tell em to come in said
mr morrison but if its anybody i
owe money to or dont know well tell
em ive just been called over to see the
governor about the friars land grants
say he wants my professional opinion
in the matter in other words tell em
ive been called into consultation
but if its a client senor sug-
gested the typewriter

  sanchez said mr morrison threat-
eningly how many times have i
threatened to discharge you for kidding
me  did you ever see a client in this
office echo answers no will you
ever see one echo answers perhaps
when somebody else takes it pull up
that screen in front of me and go tell
em anything you like

  fie drank his scotch and composed
himself for slumber the knock on the
door was repeated this time it was an
irritated staccato knock sanchez the

typewriter went the length of the long
room and opened the door

  ah senorita he said dazzled

  i am the senorita ybarra she told
him speaking spanish i wish to see
your master at once

  my employer returned sanchez
with emphasis is at present called into
consultation about the friars land
grants

  redmond morrison who at the first
sound of her voice had peeped from
behind the screen now rattled the
screen violently

  you dolt you ass you carabao you
lemon-faced loon he muttered

  he will be back some time to-day
continued sanchez but i cannot tell
just when he is a very busy man and
a very good lawyer all the judges ask
his opinion before they deliver sentence

on criminals he-

  if he is not in i will find another
she said i do not know your master
but his sign was the first lawyers sign
i saw on the escolta and so i knocked
redmond morrison with trembling
fingers fastened his blouse hooked the
collar and jumped up nearly overturn-
ing the screen he came forward his
hat on as though he had just entered
from the street and was as yet obli-
vious of the presence of the fair visitor
in spite of his haste he had not for-
gotten to catch up a bundle of papers
which had been on the typewriters
desk and now his eyes disregarding the
girl and fastened on sanchez with pro-
fessional abstraction he handed them
over one by one speaking rapidly

  my opinion on the friars land
grants type that quickly the gov-
ernors secretary is waiting to incorpo-
rate it in his report to washington
then the brief of general aguinaldos
case against the government-that must
be filed at the ayunamiento before two

oclock and-

  he broke off as sanchez pointed sig-
nificantly

  whats that whats that he in-
quired with some irritation why do
you interrupt me

  sanchez pointed again mr morri-


the popular magazine

son turned and his hat was suddenly
doffed

  your pardon miss-er-

  ybarra

  your pardon miss ybarra i did
not see you just a moment please

  he handed the rest of the papers to
sanchez

  the others can wait until i have
spoken with miss ybarra attend to
those two at once quick now

  sanchez departed and with his back
turned grinned to such an alarming ex-
tent that it seemed his face was being
neatly divided into halves

  now miss ybarra said mr mor-
rison with elaborate professional
courtesy as he led her to a chair from
which unobserved he had hastily
pushed a tennis racquet a cap and a
pair of spurs and had kicked them un-
der a desk to whom am i indebted
for the honor of your visit some
mutual friend has recommended me to
you 

 sitting down she studied his
freckled good-humored face now
struggling to show a serious air

  no she replied i have not been
told to come here by any one i left
my house hurriedly and drove down to
the escolta to find a lawyer and as you
were the first one in the block i came
here

  mr morrison lifted surprised eye-
brows- at her ignorance of his exist-
ence

  well it doesnt matter so long as
you are here he said and now i
am entirely at your service

  my case will require some time
she said if you are very busy-

  i am never too busy to serve a beau-
tiful woman mr morrison assured
her forgetting to look professional

  she took the compliment as a matter
of course

  very well then she said and put
down a package-of papers tied with red
tape i want you to transfer all this
property from my name to that of lieu-
tenant kirby rae of the philippines
constabulary i do not wish you to ask
me any questions i wish this done i
do not know the legal proceedings in

the matter but i know that it can be
done and it must be done this after-
noon for myself i keep enough prop-
erty to furnish me with an income of
four thousand pesos a year the rest
is transferred to lieutenant kirby with
no restrictions the amount to be
transferred amounts i believe to about
two million pesos will you please be-
gin at once

  mr morrison had a violent desire to
gape at the sum mentioned but he re-
strained himself and gave an admir-
able imitation of a man to whom the
transference of such a sum is merely a
matter of everyday business

  speaking in a broad sense he
opined judicially there is no great dif-
ficulty in doing wthat you wish imme-
diately all that is necessary is to
make a list of the various foldings and
the percentage each pays from this
subtract the total sum necessary to
bring to you four thousand pesos a
year and transfer the other holdings
mentioning each item by name to lieu-
tenant rae i will draw up such a pa-
per and you will sign it in the presence
of two witnesses that as i said be-
fore would in a broad sense bind the

transaction of course-

  that is what i wish you to do
then she said looking him squarely
in the eyes i believe there is some
point in law about a persons sanity
being called into question

  she spoke in stilted english forming
each avord carefully

  there is of course he agreed

coke on contracts says-

  never mind she interrupted
look at me am i quite sane

  he caught his breath as the full meas-
ure of her golden-brown loveliness
struck him

  the question is he muttered is
whether i am or not

  you said 

  i said you were quite sane miss
ybarra he returned

  very well then she sighed con-
tentedly now i will sit here and
write a letter when you have drawn
up the paper please have three copies
of it made one copy i will keep one
the inn of the seven sins



you will keep the other i wish you to
take to lieutenant rae with the letter i
am going to write please waste no
time

  he picked up the cap from under the
desk dusted off a place for her and set
pens ink and paper before her as
her little golden head bent over the
desk intent on her task mr morrison
watched her one hand holding the bun-
dle of papers

  holy cats he murmured is there
any dope in those cigarillos or is the
scotch mixed with absinth is this
manila or is it bagdad am i on a
jag in sampaloc and will i presently
bang my head on the floor 

  he untied the tape and began to ex-
amine the papers

  well he concluded im having a
rattling good time in this dream any-
how  by all the gods of milwaukee
rheims and shanghai i hope it lasts
long enough for me to spend some of
the mazuma i cop out of the deal i
wonder he added reflectively
whether the dream will run to a din-
ner with her at the hotel oriente

v

  you alarm me my friend said don
ambrosino

  not half as much as i alarm my-
self replied guy greenough i tell
you the girl has lost her senses over this
american chap and that if we dont
jolly well mind our points therell be an
end to everything weve planned i had
an idea up till this afternoon that i
would be able to make a deep enough
impression upon her to make her think
she cares for me but i havent any
such idea as that now mark you i
was perfectly straight about the matter
it wasnt any question of the money i
am as much in love with the girl as i
can possibly be with any one and ac-
cording to our agreement i was to re-
ceive one-quarter of the money any-
how for my assistance in tricking her
into a belief that we were fomenting an
uprising in the islands of course this
gun-running business is profitable
enough as it stands to warrant my being

here and theres nothing to prevent her
believing we are buying the arms for
patriots when really the rascally thieves
up mountain are paying for them them-
selves when had she agreed to sign
the paper making over her property to
you for the cause  he laughed

  tt was to be done to-morrow re-
plied don ambrosino scowling i
have got together all the title deeds
statements bonds and so forth she
was to keep for herself an income of
four thousand pesos a year the rest
was to be used for revolutionary pur-
poses-more than a million dollars in
american money ah

  of which i receive fifty thousand
pounds murmured greenough fifty

thousand pounds-

  and well paid too well paid said
ambrosino sharply for you have done
nothing except carry out my orders
play a part which i myself have written
for you

  perhaps agreed greenough but
not every man could have played such a
part convincingly besides you needed
a man who was really employed in some
such work-such work as you would
have her believe will be continued on a
larger scale with her money besides
that you are to receive a certain per
cent of every commission i make for
landing arms for benitos ladrones
you are to use my house my serv-
ants my lands for the pursuance of
your purpose ambrosino reminded
him

  pardon me disputed the other
the senoritas house the senoritas
servants the senoritas lands

  they will be mine to-morrow said
ambrosino heavily

  and mine added greenough

  they stared at each other and green-
ough read in ambrosinos dark look
something he was quick to put into
words

  your house-your servants-your
lands he said slowly i wonder if i
understand see here ambrosino i
am going down to an island where you
have a hundred or more rascals who
would slip a knife into my back for the
mere matter of a bottle of wine


thb popular magazine

  the spaniards face remained im-
passive

  when i first met you in paris con-
tinued greenough speaking quietly
and found that you were one of those
interested in smuggling arms into the
philippines i thought you were a mis-
guided patriot like the rest of the
crowd then i found it was simply an
investment on your part that paid a
good return you knew the kild of
men you were shipping arms to-not
patriots but thieves and murderers
who preyed on their own people now
i was in the thing because it was a busi-
ness and i couldnt get into another
army besides i took no interest in the
philippines nor in america well i
had you sized up then as the yankees
say for-somewhat of an oyster and a
man of jolly little moral sense when
you proposed this scheme of relieving
your cousin of most of her worldly
wealth i went into it because i needed
the money and also because i was in
love with inez and thought id man-
age to get her and the money too but
i was rather suspicious of the alacrity
you showed in offering me one-fourth
of her fortune for assisting you in de-
ceiving her and now by george i
believe i can see through the millstone
i dont believe you ever intended to pay
me the money at all i believe on the
other hand that once on your bally old
island guy greenough would disappear
utterly from things earthly and-

  in the light of the flickering candles
he noted something in ambrosinos
eyes

  by all the saints i believe im
right he cried slyly he slipped his re-
volver to the table keeping his hand
over it ambrosino lighted a cigarette
and stared at him slowly smiling

  i am right said greenough not
without an accent of admiration

  ambrosino smoked on

 well greenough drew a long
breath then brought his hand down
heavily on the revolver so that it rat-
tled and jumped ambrosino looked at
it incuriously smiled again and blew
some smoke rings

  dyou notice that weapon green-

ough continued ive been carrying
that a rather decentish time and it has
played the deuce with more than one
man who hasnt played the game fairly
with me just remember that ambro-
sino i shant use it until i have to but
ill keep my eyes about me until to-
morrow and to-morrow when she
has signed that paper transferring her
fortune to you ill present your promis-
sory note for fifty thousand pounds
which will be signed in the presence of
two witnesses to-night

  ambrosino looked up to see the re-
volver pointed directly at his head

  hands up ambrosino said green-
ough briefly

  the spaniard shrugging his shoul-
ders complied greenough reached
across the table and patted his compan-
ions hip pockets from which his hands
went to his breast and under his arms

  good enough said the briton
now write-and write exactly vyhat i
tell you

  guy amigo mio said ambrosino
quietly i realize that you are in the
right you wish a promise in writing
for fifty thousand pounds signed by
me put away your revolver i will
give it to you

  it was while he spoke that the door-
knob rattled the door opened and ynes
ybarra came into the room greenough
hastily concealed the weapon ambro-
sino lighted another cigarette

  she wasted no time in preliminaries
abstractedly a glow in her eyes she
came down to the table and put two
slim hands upon it looking from one
man to the other

  i have come to tell you she said
slowly that i am to have no more to
do with the plan also i leave this
house and go to-night to the man i
love he is american and i cannot
plot against his country so good-by to
both of you i doubt that i shall ever
see you again my life is cast in other
lines it is not good that i should know
you because i go to a man who is un-
like you and i go to live his life
both started up facing her incredu-
lously the candelabrum jarred nearly
toppled two of the flames went out
the inn of the seven sins



  but the money for the cause said
ambrosino in his heavy slow tones
that she knew for signs of inward tu-
mult

  that is over she said i no
longer have money to-day i pleaded
with him to join us but he would not
because it was the act of a traitor and
i sent him away but when he had
gone i realized that i cared for nothing
on earth except him-that the plan was
nothing to me-you ambrosino noth-
ing to me my country-i have none 
my life-it is to be his and so that i
might show my trust and love in him
show also that i would use none of my
wealth against his country i to-day
went to a lawyer who has transferred
to his name all of my money and hold-
ings except the four thousand pesos a
year which i had meant to keep from
the plan there is the paper it is
legal and i am sane and now that you
know i cannot help you with money
you will not mind if i go

  greenough was the first to take the
paper and as he perused it don am-
brosino looked over his shoulder his
brows meeting his mouth lengthening
into a thin cruel red line greenough
sat down heavily the paper fluttered
to the floor ambrosino his bronze re-
placed by chalky white the red of his
lips now becoming ashen blew out a
furious breath snatched up the paper
and tore it across then into tiny bits

  the girl laughed

  that is useless she said the
lawyer has another copy and the man i
love has by this time received one also
so that you see i am determined and
i say good-by

  you are right said ambrosino
after a tense moment and i am wrong
it was only my devotion to our country

and my plans that for the moment
made me forget but it is your right
to use your property as you will if
you wish we will say good-by ynes
forgive me

  he crossed to the sideboard and his
back to her dropped into a wineglass
some liquid from a little green vial he
took from his waistcoat pocket pour-
ing three glasses of wine he brought
them forward on a salver extending
them to her

  we will drink to your health and to
that of the man you love he said

  she had not seen his action and was
deceived by his smiling sang-froid she
took the glass nearest her greenough
and ambrosino raised their glasses

  to the health of the senorita ynes
-and her husband proposed ambro-
sino still smiling

  they drank the toast she gave to
each a hand

  good-by she said and left the
room

  greenough turned an inquiring gaze
to the spaniard

  you drugged that wine

 ambrosino nodded i have never
known when a sleeping potion is not a
good thing to carry on all occasions i
need it for my insomnia a drop puts
me to sleep almost at once i gave her
two by the time she has reached her
own room she will be ready to fall upon
her bed she will not awaken until we
have taken her from manila

  he sat down igniting a cigarette
from one of the guttering candles

  and now he said piecing together
the bits of torn paper he had taken from
the floor we will note the names of the
constabulary lieutenant and the law-

the wrecking boss

by frank l packard
author ef   the king of fools the guardian of the devips slide etc

    the job of wrecking boss on a railroad needs a hard man flannagan was
more than hard he was rough uncultured primal a brute man perhaps full
of the elemental fiery hot-headed his passions alone swayed him thats
why although supreme in a railroad wreck he was the veriest novice at
straightening out the tangles in his own home

opinions right or wrong on
any subject are a matter of in-
dividuality-there have been
different opinions about flan-
nagan on the hill division but the
story is straight enough-from car tink
to superintendent there has never been
any difference of opiniofi on that score

  flannagan was the wrecking boss
regan the master mechanic said the
job fitted flannagan for it took a hard
man for the job and flannagan bar
none was the hardest man on the pay
roll hardest at crooking elbows in mac-
guires blazing star saloon hardest
with his fists and hardest of all when
it came to getting at the heart of some
scalding mangled horror of death and
ruin that a man wouldnt be called a
coward to turn from-sick

  flannagan looked it he stood six
feet one in his stockings and his chest
and shoulders were like the front-end
view youd get looking at a sturdy well-
grown ox he wasnt pretty his face
was scarred with cuts and burns enough
to stall any german dueling student on
a siding till the rails rusted and the
beard he grew to hide these iriultitud-
inous disfigurements just naturally
came out in tussocks he had black eyes
that could go coal black and lose their
pupils and a shock of black hair that
fell into them half the time also he

had a tongue that wasnt elegant that
was flannagan-flannagan the wreck-
ing boss

  its queer the way things happen
queer the way they come about-and
its pretty hard to call the turn of the
card when dame fortune deals the
bank its a trite enough saying that it
is the unexpected that happens in life
but the reason its trite is because its
immeasurably true

  flannagan growled and swore and
cursed one night coming back from a
bit of a spill up the line because they
stalled him and his wrecking outfit
for an hour about half a mile west of
big cloud-the reason being that like
the straw that broke the camels back
a circus train in from the east billed
for a three days lay-off at big cloud
had seeking siding temporarily choked
the yards already glutted with traffic
until the mix-up gleeson the yardmas-
ter had to wrestle with would have put
a problem in differential calculus into
the kindergarten class

  flannagan was very dirty and withal
very tired and when finally they gave
him the clear and his flat and caboose
and his staggering derrick rumbled sul-
lenly down toward the roundhouse and
shops the sight of gilded cages gaud-
ily decorated cars and converted pull-
mans that were second-class-tourist
thb wrecking 



equipment painted white did not as-
suage his feelings neither was there
enchantment for him in the roars of
multifarious beasts nor in the hybrid
smells that assailed his nostrils from the
general direction of the menagerie

  flannagan for an hours loss of
sleep with heartiness and abandon con-
signed that particular circus also all
others and everything thereunto per-
taining from fangless serpents to steam
calliopes to regions that are popularly
credited with being somewhat warmer
than the torrid zone on the hottest day
in midsummer but then-flannagan
did not know

  opinions differ flannagan was
about the last man on earth that any
one on the hill division would have
picked out for a marrying man and
equally true the other way round about
the last man they would have picked
out as one a pretty girl would zvant to
marry with her maybe it was the
strength of the man since they say that
comes first with women with him
maybe it was just the trim little brown-
eyed brown-haired figure that could
ricle with the grace of a fairy any-
way the only thing about it that didnt
surprise any one was the fact that
when it came it came as sudden and
quick as a head-on smash around a
right-angled curve that was flanna-
gans way for flannagan if he was
nothing else was impulsive

  that night flannagan cursed the cir-
cus  the next day he saw daisy mac-
queen riding in the street parade and-
but this isnt the story of flannagans
courtship not but that the courtship of
any man like flannagan would be worth
the telling-only there are other things

  at first rig cloud winked and
chuckled slyly to itself and then when
the circus left and flannagan got a
week off and left with it it guffawed
outright-but when at the end of that
week flannagan brought back airs
flannagan nee daisy macoueen big
cloud stuck its tongue in its cheek
wagged its head and waited develop-
ments

  this is the story of the developments

  maybe that same impulsiveness of
  b

flannagans that could be blind and
bullheaded coupled with a passion that
was like a devils when aroused was
to blame maybe the women of big
cloud following the lead of mrs mac-
aloon the engineers wife and the
leader of society circles who shook her
fiery red head and turned up her celtic
nose disdainfully at daisy macoueen
had something to do with it maybe
daisy herself had a little pride-but
whats the use of speculating it all
goes back to the same beginning-opin-
ions differ

  tongues wagged flannagan listened
-thats the gist of it but once for all
let it be said and understood that daisy
macqueen was as straight as they
make them she hadnt been brought
up the way mrs macaloon and her
coterie had and she liked to laugh liked
to play liked to live and not exist in a
humdrum way ever over washtubs and
a cook stove-though all credit to her
who hadnt been used to them she never
shirked one nor the other

  the womens ideas about circuses and
circus performers were putting it
mildly puritanical but the men liked
daisy macoueen-and took no pains to
hide it they clustered around her
and before long she ruled them all im-
perially with a nod of her pretty head
and as a result the womens ideas from
puritanical became more so-which is
human nature big cloud or anywhere
else

  at first flannagan was proud of the
little wife he had brought to big cloud
-proud of her for the very attitude
adopted toward her by his mates but
as the months went by gradually the
wagging tongues got in their work
gradually flannagan began to listen
and the jealousy that was his by na-
ture above the jealousy of most men
commenced to smokier into flame just
a rankling jealousy directed against no
one in particular-just jealousy
things up at the little house off main
street where the flannagans lived
werent as harmonious as they had
been

  in the beginning daisy not treating
the matter seriously answered flanna-


the popular magazine

gan with a laugh finally she answered
him not at all and that stage unfor-
tunately far from unique in other homes
than flannagans the world over was
reached where only some one act word
or deed was needed to bring matters to
a head

  perhaps after all there was poetic
justice in flannagans cursing of the
circus for it was the circus that sup-
plied that one thing needed not that
the circus came back to town-it didnt
-but a certain round little ferret-eyed
short pompadour-haired wax-mus-
mustached perfumed monsieur ferrar-
ingi the ringmaster did

  ferraringi was a scoundrel-what he
got he deserved there was never any
doubt about that but that night flan-
nagan when he walked into the house-
saw only ferraringi on his knees before
daisy heard only impassioned flowery
words and in the blind fury that trans-
formed him from man to beast the
scorn contempt and horror in daisys
eyes the significance of the rigid little
figure with tight-clenched hands was
lost ferraringi had been in love with
daisy flannagan knew that and his
seething brain remembered that the
circus people had told him so daisy
had told him so ferraringi had told
him so with a snarl and a threat-and
he had laughed-then

  one instant flannagan hung upon the
threshold fie was not a pretty sight
back from a wreck he was still in his
overalls and these were smeared with
blood-four carloads of steers had gone
into premature shambles in the ditch
one instant flannagan hung there his
face working convulsively-and then he
jumped his left hand locked into the
collar of the ringmasters coat his arm
straightened like the tautening chains of
his own derrick crane and as the other
came off his knees and upright from
the yank flannagans right swung a
terrific full-arm smash that landing a
little above the jaw plastered one side
of that tonsorial work of art the waxed
and curled mustache flat into ferrar-
ingis cheek

  ferraringis answer as he wriggled
free was a torrent of malediction-and

a blinding flash daisy screamed the
shot missed but the powder singed
flannagans face

  it was the only shot that ferraringi
fired with a roar high-pitched like
the maddened trumpeting of an ele-
phant amuck flannagan with a single
blow sent the revolver sailing ceiling
high-then his arms like steel piston
rods worked in and out and his fists
drummed an awful merciless tattoo
upon the ringmaster

  the smoke from the shot filled the
room with pungent odor chairs and
furniture overturned broken crashed
to the floor daisy wild-eyed with
parted lips dumb with terror crouched
against the wall her hands clasped to
her breast-but before flannagans
eyes all was red-red

  a battered bruised reeling stagger-
ing form before him curled up suddenly
and slid in a heap at his feet flan-
nagan with groping hands and twitch-
ing fingers reached for it---and then
with a rush other forms many of them
came between him and what was on the
floor

  it was very good for ferraringi very
good for that was all that saved him-
flannagan was seeing only red

  the neighbors lifted the stunned ring-
master limp as rags to his feet flan-
nagan brushed his great fist once across
his eyes in a half-dazed way and glared
at the roomful of people suddenly he
heaved forward pushing those nearest
him violently toward the door

  get out of here he bellowed
hoarsely get out curs-e you dye
hear  get out

  there were men in that little crowd
men besides the three or four women
mrs macaloon among them men not
reckoned overfaint of spirit in big
cloud by those who knew but they
knew flannagan and they went-went
half carrying half dragging the ring-
master oiled and perfumed now in a
fashion grimly different than before

  get out roared flannagan again
to hurry them and as the last one dis-
appeared he whirled on daisy and
you too he snarled get out

  terrified shaken by the scene as she
the wrecking boss



was his words their implication their
injustice whipped her into scorn and
anger white-lipped she stared at him
for an instant

  you dare she burst out you dare
to--

  get out-flannagans voice in his
passion was a thick stumbling guttural
whisper get out go back to your
circus-go where you like get out
his hand dove into his pockets and its
contents bills and coins what there was
of them he flung upon the table get
out-as far as that will take you

  daisy macqueen was proud-per-
haps though not above the pride of
other women the blood was hot in
her cheeks her big brown eyes had a
light in them near to that light with
which she had faced ferraringi but a
short time before her breath came in
short hard little gasps for a full min-
ute she did not speak-and then the
words came cold as death

  some day-some day michael
flannagan youll get what you de-
serve

  thats what im gettin now-what i
deserve he flung back then halting
in the doorway you understand eh
get out im lettin you down easy
get out of big cloud get out before
im back number fifteenll be in in
an hour-youd better take her

  flannagan stepped out onto the
street a curious little group had col-
lected two houses down in front ofirs
macaloons flannagan glanced at
them muttered a curse and then head
down between his shoulders clenched
fists rammed in his pockets he headed
in the other direction toward main
street five minutes later he pushed
the swinging doors of the blazing star
open and walked down the length of
the room to where pete macguire the
proprietor lounged across the bar

  pete--he jerked out his words
hoarsely-next tuesdays pay day-is
my face good till then

  macguire looked at him curiously
the news of the fracas had not reached
the blazing star

  why sure said he sure it is

flannagan if you want it whats
eating--

  then let em come my way flan-
nagan rapped out with a savage laugh
an let em come-fast

  flannagan was the wrecking boss a
hard man regan had called him and
he was-a product of the wild rough
pioneering life one of those men who
had followed the grim-faced bearded
corps of engineers as they pitted their
strength against the sullen gray of the
mighty rockies from the eastern foot-
hills to the plains of the sierras fight-
ing every inch of their way with in-
domitable perseverance and daring over
chasms and gorges through tunnels and
cuts in curves and levels and grades
against obstacles that tried their souls
against death itself taping the thin steel
lines they left behind them with their
own blood hard yes flannagan
was hard uncultured rough primal he
came from that a brute man perhaps
full of the elemental-fiery hot-headed
his passions alone swayed him that
side of flannagan the years in the
very environment in which he had lived
them had developed to the full-the
other side had been untouched what
flannagan did that night another might
not have done-or he might the
judging of men is a grave business best
let alone

  flannagan let go his hold then-not
at once but gradually the night spent
in the blazing star was the first of
others-others that followed insidiously
each closer upon the formers heels
daisy had gone-hadgone that night-
where he did not know and told him-
self he did not care he grew nv ody
sullen uncompanionable big loud
took sides-the women for flai-ran
the men for the wife flannagan - ited
the women avoided the men-and v ent
to the blazing star

  there was only one result-the inev-
itable one regan kindly for all his
gruffness understanding in a way
stood between flannagan and the su-
per and warned flannagan oftener
than most men were warned on the hill
division nor were his warnings alto-
gether without effect flannagan would


the cpopulacr magazine

steady up-temporarily-maybe for a
week-then off again steady up just
long enough to keep putting off and
postponing the final reckoning and
then one day some six months after
daisy flannagan had gone away the
master mechanic warned him for the
last time

  im through with you flannagan
he snapped understand that im
out from under and next time youll
talk to carleton-and what hell have to
say wont take long--about two seconds
you know carleton dont you well
then-what 

  it was just a week to a day after that
that flannagan cut loose and wild again
he made a night and a day of it and
then another after that though by
that time flannagan was quite unaware
of the fact some of the boys got him
home dumped him on his bed and left
him to his reflections-which were a
blank

  flannagan slept it off and it took
about eighteen hours to do it when
he came to himself he was in a humor
that far from being happy was atro-
cious  likewise there were bodily ail-
ments-flannagans head was bad and
felt as though a gang of boilermakers
working against time were driving
rivets in it he procured himself a
bracer and went back to bed this re-
sulted in a decidedly improved physi-
cal condition but when he arose late
in the afternoon any improvement there
might hive been in his mental state was
speedily dissipated-flannagan found a
letter shoved under his door post-
marked the day before and with it an
official manila envelope from the supers
office

  he opened the letter and read it-
read it again while his jaws worked
and the red surged in a passion into
his face then with an oath he tore
it savagely into shreds flung the bits
on the floor and stamped upon them
viciously with his heavy nail-heeled
boot

  the official manila he did not open
at all a guess was enough for that-
a curt request to present himself in the
supers office probably flannagan

glared at it then grabbed his hat and
started down for the station there
was no idea of shirking it-flannagan
wasnt that kind at any time and just
now his mood if anything spurred him
on rather than held him back flan-
nagan welcomed the prospect of a row
about anything with anybody at that
moment-if only a war of words

  carletons office was upstairs over the
ticket office and next to the dispatchers
room then for the station did duty for
headquarters and everything else-not
now its changed now and theres a
rather imposing gray-stone structure
where the old wooden shack used to be
but no matter thats the way it was
then for those were the early days
when the road was young and in the
making

  flannagan reached the station
climbed the stairs and pushed carle-
tons door open with little ceremony

  you want to see me he demanded
gruffly as he stepped inside

  carleton superintendent of the hill
division sitting at his desk looked up
and eyed the wrecking boss coolly for a
minute

  no flannagan he said curtly i
dont

  then what in blazes dye send for
me for flannagan flung out in a
growl

  see here flannagan snapped
carleton ive no time to talk to yon
youvican read cant you youre out

 flannagan blinked	

  was that what was in the letter

  it was-just that said carleton
grimly

  hell-flannagans short laugh
held a jeering note of contempt i
didnt open it-or mabbe id have
known eh

  carletons eyes narrowed

  well you know now dont you

 sure-flannagan scowled and
licked his lips im out thrown out

by a--

  then get out carleton cut in
sharply youve had more chances
than any man ever got before from me
thanks to regan but youve had your
the wrecking boss



last and talking wont do you any good
now

flannagan stepped nearer to the desk

talkin whos talkin he flared
in sudden bravado didnt i tell you

i didnt read your - letter didnt

i eh didnt i  dye think id crawl
to you or any man for a job  im out
am i  dye think i came down to ask
you to take me back id see you rot
first tell with the job-see

  few men on the hill division had
ever seen carleton lose his temper-it
wasnt carletons way of doing things
he didnt lose it now but his words
were like trickling drops of ice water

  sometimes flannagan he said to
make a man like you understand one
has to use your language you say
youd see me rot before you asked me
for the job back again-very well id
rot before i gave it to you after this
now will you get out-or be thrown
out

  for a moment it looked as though
flannagan was going to mix it there
and then his eyes went ugly and his
fists horny and gnarled doubled into
knots as he glared viciously at the
super

  carleton who was afraid of no man
or aggregation of men his face stern-
set and hard leaned back in his swivel
chair and waited

  a tense minute passed then flan-
nagans better sense weighed down the
balance and without so much as a
word he turned went out of the room
and stamped heavily down the stairs

  goaded into it or through unbridled
ill-advised impulse men say rash things
sometimes--afterward both flannagan
and carleton were to remember their
own and the others words and the fu-
tility of them nor was it to be long
afterward-without warning without
so much as a premonition quick and
sudden as doom things happen in rail-
roading

  it was half past five when flanna-
gan went out of the supers office it
was but ten minutes later when before
he had decanted a drop from the bottle
he had just lifted to fill his glass he

slapped it back on the bar of the blaz-
ing star with a sudden jerk from
down the street in the direction of the
yards boomed three long blasts from
the shop whistle-the wrecking signal
it came again and again men around
him began to move chairs from the
little tables were pushed hurriedly back
the bell in the english chapel took up
the alarm it stirred the blood in flan-
nagans veins-whipped it to his cheeks
in fierce excitement-it was the call to
arms

  he turned from the bar-and stopped
like a man stunned there had been
times in the last six months when he
had not responded to that call because
deaf to everything he had not heard it
then it had been his call-the call for
the wrecking crew and-first of all for
the wrecking boss now-there was a
dazed look on his face and his lips
worked queerly it was not for him
he was barred-out

  slowly he turned back to the bar
rested his foot on the rail and with a
mirthless laugh and a shrug of his
shoulders reached for the bottle again
he poured the whisky glass full to the
brim-and laughed once more and
shrugged his shoulders as his fingers
curled around it he raised the glass-
and held it poised halfway to his lips

  quick-running steps came up the
street the swinging doors of the blaz-
ing star burst open and a call boy
shoved in his head

  wreckers out wreckers out he
bawled number twos gone to glory
in spider cut everybodys killed-
and he was gone a grimy-faced har-
binger of death and disaster gone
speeding with his summons to wherever
men were gathered throughout the little
town

  an instant flannagan stood motion-
less as one transformed from flesh to
sculptured clay-then the glass slid
from his fingers and crashed into tin-
kling splinters on the floor the liquor
splashed his boots like one who moves
in unknown places through the dark so
then flannagan moved toward the
door men looked at him in amaze-
ment and stood aside to let him pass


the popular magazine

something was tugging at his heart
beating at his brain impelling him for-
ward  a force irresistible that in its
first sudden overwhelnfing surge he
could not understand could not grasp
could not focus into concrete form-
could not obey

  he passed out through the doors and
then for the first time a cry rang from
his lips there were no halting stum-
bling uncertain steps now men run-
ning down the street called to flanna-
gan as he sped past them flannagan
made no answer did not look their
way his face strained and full of dumb
anguish was set toward the station

  he gained the platform and raced
along it shouts came from across the
yards up and down the spurs flut-
tered the fore-shortened little yard en-
gine coughing sparks and wheezing
from her exhaust as she bustled the
wrecking train together lamps swung
and twinkled like fireflies for it was
just opening spring and the dark fell
early in front of the roundhouse the
 blowing hard from her safety un-
der a full head of stream like a thor-
oughbred that scents the race was al-
ready on the table

  with a heave of his great shoulders
and a sweep of his arms flannagan
won through the group of trainmen
shop hands and loungers clustered
around the door and took the stairs
four at a leap

  a light burned in the supers office
but the voices came from the dispatch-
ers room and there in the doorway
flannagan halted-halted just for a sec-
onds pause while his eyes swept the
scene before him

  regan the master mechanic by the
window was mouthing curses under his
breath as men do in times of stress
spence the dispatcher white-faced the
hair straggling into his eyes was lean-
ing over the key under the green-shaded
lamp over the key clearing the line
while the sounder clicked in his ears
of ruin and of lives gone out harvey
the division engineer was there pulling
savagely at a brier with empty bowl
and at the dispatchers elbow stood
carleton a grim commander facing tid-

ings of disaster his shoulders braced
and bent a little forward as though to
take the blow his jaws clamped tight
till the lips compressed were bloodless
and the chiseled lines on his face told
of the bitterness in his heart

  then flannagan stepped forward

  carleton he cried and his words
came like panting sobs carleton give
me back my job

  it was no place for flannagan

  carletons cup was already full to
overflowing and he swung on flanna-
gan like a flash his hand lifted and
pointed to the door

  get out of here he said between
his teeth

  carleton cried flannagan again
and his arms went out in supplication
toward the super carleton give me
back my job-give it back to me for to-
night-just for to-night

  no-the single word came from
carletons lips like a thunderclap

  flannagan shivered a little and
shrank back

  just for to-night he mumbled
hoarsely just for-

  no -carletons voice rang hard as
doom i tell you no get out of
here

  harvey moved suddenly threaten-
ingly toward flannagan-and as sud-
denly flannagan roused by the act
brushed the engineer aside like a play-
thing sprang forward and with a
quick fierce grip caught carletons
arms and pinioned them viselike to his
sides

  and i tell you yes-his voice rose
dominant with the power the will that
shook him now to the depths of his tur-
bulent soul as a man that knows no
law  obstacle no restraint as a man
who would batter down the gates of hell
itself to gain his end so then was flan-
nagan i tell you yes  i tell you yes
my wife and babys in that wreck to-
night

  turmoil shouts the short quick in-
termittent hiss of steam as the  her
cylinder cocks open backed down to the
platform the clash of coupling cars a
jumbled medley of sounds floated up
from the yard without-but within the
the wrecking 



little room the chattering sounder for
the moment stilled there fell a silence
as of death and no man among them
moved or spoke

  flannagan gray-faced gasping his
mighty grip still on carleton his head
thrown forward close to the others
stared into the supers facc-and for
a long minute in the twitching muscles
of the big wreckers face in the look-
that man reads seldom in his fellows
eyes carleton drew the fearful picture
lived the awful story that the babbling
wire had told royal carleton square
man and big of heart his voice broke
god help you flannagan-go

 no word came from flannagans
lips-only a queer choking sound as
his hands dropped to his sides-only a
queer choking sound as he turned sud-
denly and jumped for the door

  on the stairs macallister the driver
of the  passed flannagan coming
up for his orders

  bad spill i hear growled the en-
gineer as he went by five-fives
pony truck jumped the rails on
the lower curve and everythings in
the ditcn old burkes gone out and a
heap of the passengers with him
flannagan heard no more-he was on
the platform now coupled behind the
derrick crane and the tool car were two
coaches improvised ambulances and
into these latter instead of the tool car
the men of the wrecking gang were pil-
ing-a bad smash brought luxury for
them shouts cries hubbub a babel of
voices were around him but in his
brain repeated and repeated over and
over again lived only a phrase from
the letter he had torn to pieces
stamped under heel that afternoon-the
words were swimming before his eyes

  michael dear weve both been wrong im
bringing baby back on the limited friday-
night

  men with little black bags brushed by
him and tumbled into the rear coach-
the doctors of big cloud to the last one
of them macallister came running
from the station a bit of tissue his or-
ders fluttering in his hand-and sprang
for the cab ten-fourteens exhaust

burst suddenly into quick deafening ex-
plosions the sparks shot volleying heav-
enward from her short stack the big
whirling drivers were beginning to bite
-and then through the gangway after
the engineer into the cab swung flan-
nagan-flannagan the wrecking boss

  spider cut is the eastern gateway of
the rockies and it lies as the crows
fly fifteen miles from big cloud but
the right of way as it twists and turns
circling and dodging the buttes that
grow from mounds to foothills makes
it on the blue prints twenty-one deci-
mal seven the running time of the
fast fliers on this stretch is-but what
of that macallister that night
smashed all records and the medical
men in the rear coach tell to this day
how they clung for life and limb to their
seats and to each other and most of
them will admit-which is admitting
much-that they were frightened
white-lipped men with broken nerves

  as the wreck special with a clash
and clatter shattered over the switches
in the upper yard and nosed onto the
main line bull coussirat who had the
shovel end of it with a snatch at the
chain swung open the furnace door and
a red glow lighted up the heavens mac-
allister turned in his seat and looked
at the giant form of the wrecking boss
behind him-they had told him the story
in the office

  the eyes of the two men met flan-
nagans lips moved dumbly and with a
curious pleading motion he gestured
toward the throttle

  macallister opened another notch
fie laughed a grim hard laugh

  i knowmie shouted over the roar
i know leave it to me flannagan

  the bark of the exhaust came quicker
and quicker swelled and rose into the
full deep-toned thunder of a single
note notch by notch macallister
opened out the  notch by notch
and the big mountain racer answering
like a mettlesome steed to the touch of
the whip leaped forward ever faster
into the night

  now the headlight played on shining
steel ahead now suddenly threw a path
of light across the short yellow stubble


the popular magazine

of a rising butte and macallister
checked grudgingly for an instant as
they swung the curve-just for an in-
stant then into the straight again with
wide-flung throttle

  it was mad work-and in that reel-
ing dizzy cab no man spoke the
sweep of the singing wind the wild tat-
too of beating trucks the sullen whir
of flying drivers was in their ears while
behind the derrick crane the tool car
and the coaches writhed and wriggled
swayed and lurched tearing at their
coupling bouncing on their trucks
jerking viciously as each slue took up
the axle play rolling pitching crazily
like cockleshells tossed on an angry sea

  now they tore through a cut and the
walls took up the deafening roar and
echoed and reechoed it back in volume
a thousandfold now into open and the
sudden contrast was like the gasping
breath of an imprisoned thing escaped
now over culverts trestles spans hol-
low reverberating-the speed was ter-
rific

  again and again the wide-swung fur-
nace door shot the black of the cab into
sudden fiery red and the men in it into
grim relief

  over his levers bounding on his seat
macallister tense and strained leaned
far forward following the leaping
headlights glare staggering like a
drunken man to keep his balance the
sweat standing out in glistening beads
upon his grimy face bull coussirat
watched the flickering needle on the
gauge and his shovel clanged and
swung and in the corner back of mac-
allister bent low to brace himself
thrown backward and forward with
every lurch in the fantastic dancing
light like some tigerish outraged ani-
mal crouched to spring flannagan with
head drawn into his shoulders jaws out-
thrust stared over the engineers back
stared with never a look to right or left
stared through the cab glass to the right
of way ahead-stared toward spider
cut

  again and again with sickening
giddy shock wheelbase lifted from the
swing the  struck the tangents
hung a breathless space and with a

screech of crunching flanges found the
rails once more

  again and again-but the story of
that ride is the doctors story-they tell
it best macallister made the run that
night from big cloud to spider cut
twenty-one point seven miles in nine-
teen minutes

  there have been bad spills on the
hill division bad spills-but there have
never been worse than on that friday
night when  jumped the rails at the
foot of the curve coming down the
grade just east of spider cut shot over
the embankment and piled the imperial
limited mahogany sleepers and all into
splintered wreckage forty feet below the
right of way

  as macallister checked and with
screaming brake shoes the  slowed
flannagan with a wild cry leaped from
the cab and dashed up the track ahead
of the still-moving pilot it was light
enough-the cars of the wreck nearest
him the mail and baggage cars had
caught and fanned by the wind into
yellow flames were blazing like a huge
bonfire shouts arose from below
cries anguished piercing from those
imprisoned in the wreck figures those
of the crew and passengers who had
made their escape were moving hither
and thither working as best they
might pulling others through shattered
windows and upcanted doors laying
those who were past all knowing be-
side the long row of silent forms al-
ready tenderly stretched upon the edge
of the embankment

  a man with face cut and bleeding
came running toward flannagan it
was kelly conductor of number two
flannagan jumped for him grasped him
by the shoulders and stared without a
word into his face

  but kelly shook his head

 i dont know flannagan he
choked she was in the first-class just
ahead of the pullmans theres-
theres no one come out of that car yet
-he turned away his head-we
couldnt get to it

  couldnt get to it-flarmagnns
lips repeated the phrase mechanically
then he looked-and understood the
the wrecking 



grim significance of the words he
laughed suddenly jarring hoarse as it
is not good to hear men laugh-and
with that laugh flannagan went into the
fight

  the details of that night no one man
knows there in the shadow of the
gray-walled rockies men flint-hearted
calloused rough and ready though they
were sobbed as they toiled and while
the derrick tackles creaked and moaned
ax and pick and bar swung and crashed
and tore through splintering glass and
ripping timber

  what men could do they did-and
through the hours flannagan led them
tough grizzled men more than one
dropped from sheer weariness but ever
flannagans great arms rose and fell
ever his mighty shoulders heaved ever
he led them on what men could do they
did-but it was graying dawn before
they opened a way to the heart of the
wreck-the first-class coach that once
ahead of the pullmans was under them
now

  flannagan gaunt burned and bleed-
ing a madman with reeling brain stag-
gered toward the jagged hole that they
had torn in the flooring of the car
they tried to hold him back the man
who had spurred them through the night
alternately with lashing curse and pite-
ous prayer the man who had worked
with demon strength as no three men
among them had worked the man who
was tottering now at the end in mind

and body they tried to hold him back-
for mercys sake but flannagan shook
them off and went-went laughing
again the same fearful laugh with which
he had begun the fight

  he found her there-found her with
a little bundle lying in the crook of her
outstretched arm she moaned and
held it toward him-but flannagan had
gone his limit his work was done the
tension broke

  and when they worked their way to
the far end of the car after him those
hard grim-visaged followers of flan-
nagan they found a man squatted on an
upended seat a woman beside him
death and desolation and huddled
shapes around him dandling a tiny in-
fant in his arms crooning a lullaby
through cracked lips crooning a lullaby
-to a little one long hushed already in
its last sleep

  opinions differ but big cloud to-
day sides about solid with regan

  flannagan says the master me-
chanic flannagans a pretty good
wrecking boss pretty good i dont
know of any better-since the almighty
had him on the carpet hes got a plot
up on the bvitte behind the town he and
daisy with a little mound on it they
go up there together every sunday-
neverve known em to miss a man
aint likely to fall off the right of way
again as long as he does that is he
well then forget it hes been doing
that for a year now-what

clearly a case of madness

i ouis trosky of ohio is a politician of considerable influence in his state

    one evening when he was in washington he was invited to dine at the home
of john r mclean who dabbles in ohio politics and costly tapestries

    every time mr mclean hears of a tapestry sale in europe he peels off a
section of his bank roll hands it to an agent and tells him to blow it in on the
hangings

    troskys appetite was very poor that night apparently he was in great
physical pain or felt the gnawing clutch of a secret sorrow when he got back
to ohio he made this mournful announcement

    ive always heard that john r mclean was a wise old guy its a mis-
take that old fellow is as crazy as a loon he took me in to dinner in a room
where there was absolutely nothing on the floor and all the carpets were hanging
on the wall

it available a big irrigation plant is installed ditches and dams to be filled from the coldstream but
the coldstream is being used by other ranchers adjoining-who when they learn that york will require
almost the entire normal flow of the river for his project protest through one of their number casey
dunne york gives dunne no satisfaction although admitting that if the railroad takes the water the
other farms will go dry and their owners ruined casey refuses yorks offer to buy him out a year be-
fore this casey has been held up in a transcontinental flyer and befriended a young woman in the same car
he meets her again at the home of mutual friends the wades and learns that she is clyde burnaby niece
of james c hess of the celebrated hess railway system dunne returns to the ranch and calling a
meeting at donald mccraes makes his report they promise each other to stand fast farwell the
domineering engineer in charge of the railways dam meets sheila mccrae and falls in love with her
because of this he offers her father  for his ranch but the old man will not break with the pol
the ranchers dynamite the dam and the railroad people promise dire punishment meantime casey re-

ceives a note from clyde burnaby and he writes her
comes bringing with her the wades

 chapter xvii- continued

farwell put in an appearance
after supper it was plain that
the big engineer had not ex-
pected to find other guests also
that their presence embarrassed him
quite unused to dissembling his feel-
ings he took no pains to hide his dis-
like for dunne casey on the other
hand ws polite suave quiet wearing
the mocking smile that invariably exas-
perated the engineer

 you and mr farwell are not
friends clyde ventured on the way
home

  he doesnt think much of me
casey admitted i rub him the wrong
way

  as you were doing to-night

  was i

  you know you wrere is there a pri-
vate quarrel between you apart from
the water matter 

  not exactly but it would come to
that if we saw much of each other

  then i hope you wont its em-
barrassing to others

a long letter inviting her to visit the ranch clyde

  im awfully sorry it was very bad
form of course but somehow i
couldnt help it

  never mind the mccreas are af-
fected by this water trouble arent
they 

  as much as i am you are surprised
that farwell goes there i have never
mentioned it to them nor they to me
its none of my business

  nor of mine

  i didnt mean that

  i know you didnt still i think i
could guess why mr farwell goes to
talapus

  so could i said casey dryly and
the subject dropped

  but kitty wade came to clydes
room for a chat before retiring those
mccraes she said are very nice mr
mccrae is one of the real pioneers he
told us some of the most interesting
things how did you like miss mc-
crae

  i think shes a very nice sensible
girl good-looking too

  hm said kitty wade yes i
think she is dresses nicely and simply
precious water



no imitation fine things shows the
correct instinct you and she might
have been having a plain-clothes compe-
tition

  clyde did not respond kitty wade
resumed after a brief pause ill tell
you one thing clyde this man far-
well is in love with her

  i could see that kitty

  and she doesnt care for him

  i thought that too

  i wonder kitty wade went on if
there is anything between her and mr
dunne do you suppose he and mr
farwcll are jealous of each other
they were like two dogs with one
bone

  clyde yawned oh mercy kitty
she said wearily ask me something
easier i wouldnt blame either of
them she seems to be a thoroughly
nice girl

  kitty wade on her way to her room
nodded wisely you dont fool me a
little bit clyde she said to herself
this sheila mccrae is probably just as
nice as you are and you own up to it
like a little lady but all the same you
hate each other and whats more you
both know it

chapter xviii

  clyde lay stretched at length in sweet
odorous hay there was no reason why
she should not have taken the hammock
in the shade of the veranda that morn-
ing save that she wanted to be alone
therefore she had taken a book and
wandered forth behind the corrals she
had come upon a haystack cut halfway
down and halfway across and on im-
pulse she had climbed up a short lad-
der and lain down her hands clasped
behind her head her book forgotten
she stared up into the blue sky and
dreamed daydreams and then she
went to sleep

  she was aroused by the sound of
hammering peeping over the edge of
the stack she recognized tom mchale
mchale was putting a strand of wire
around the stack and as she looked he
gan to sing a ballad of the old fron-
tier clyde had never heard sam

bass and she listened to mchales
damaged tenor

sam was born in indianner it was his na-
     tive home

and at the age of seventeen young sam
     began to roam

and first he went to texas a cowboy for
     to be-

he robs the stage at-

  he stopped abruptly and clyde saw
two mounted men approaching they
bore down on mchale who lifted his
coat from a rail and put it on to
clydes amazement the action revealed
a worn leather holster strapped to the
inner side of the garment and from it
protruded the ivory butt of a six-
shooter mchale was apparently un-
armed  in reality a weapon lay within
instant reach of his hand

 the two horsemen were roughly
dressed each wore a gun openly at
his belt one was large sandy-haired
gray-eyed the other was dark quick
restless shooting odd darting glances
from a pair of sinister black eyes

  is your name dunne asked the
first roughly

  dunne  queried mchale as if the
name wrere strange to him did you
say dunne or doane

  i said dunne

  oh mchale responded lemme
think no i guess not i never used
that name that i remember of no
partner my name aint dunne

  we want dunne wherell we find
him 

  why now said mchale thats a
right hard question you might find
him one place and then again you
mightnt i reckon i wouldnt be mis-
leading you none if i was to tell you
youd find him wherever hes at

  you workin for him the dark
man put in quickly

  i was a minute ago now i got a
job with an inquiry office anything
else i can tell you

  no said the dark man but you
can tell dunne that up to a minute ago

he had a - - fool workin for

him

  dead silence while a watch could tick
off ten seconds clyde scarcely breathed


the popular magazine

at different times in her life she had
heard noisy quarrels in city streets
quarrels big with oath and threat this
was different she experienced a sen-
sation as though even in the bright
sunshine beneath the blue unflecked
summer sky where all was instinct with
growth and health and life she were
watching a deathbed

  the two strangers sat motionless
their eyes on mchale their right hands
resting quietly by their waists mchale
stood equally still facing them his eyes
narrowed down to slits his left hand
holding the lapel of his coat his right
hand a half-smoked cigarette between
the first and second fingers on a level
with his chin he expelled a thin
stream of smoke from his lungs and
spoke

  i reckon you can tell him yourself
here he comes now

  the eyes of the first man never
shifted the other instantly looked over
his shoulder mchale laughed

  youre an old-timer he said to the
gray-eyed man but him-he jerked a
contemptuous thumb at the second-
its a wonder to me he ever growed
up dont you do it no more friend
dont you never take your eyes off a

man youve called a--fool or

maybe the next thing you behold is the
promised land

  but his words had not been intended
as a  ruse casey was riding over on
his little gray mare to see who the
strangers were and what they wanted

  this man tells me youre dunne
said the gray-eyed man

  thats correct casey admitted

  my name is dade his name is
cross he indicated his ctompanion by
a sidewise nod weve bought land
from this here irrigation outfit so
have half a dozen other men friends of
ours now we cant get water

  well

  well the company puts it up that
some of you fellows is to blame youve
cut the ditches so they wont carry
weve come to tell you that this has got
to stop

  thats kind of you anyway casey

observed quietly he and dade eyed
each other appraisingly

  what i want to make plumb clear
said the latter is that this dont go no
more its no good youll leave the

ditches alone or else-

  or else casey suggested

  or else well make rou said dade
grimly we want water and well
have it

  i wonder said casey if you are
trying to hang a nice little bluff on me
mr dade suppose for instance you
have no land and dont need any
water

  i can show you my deed

  thats quite possible all right mr
dade is there anything more you want
to say

  i reckon thats all said dade if
youll say that -the ditches will be let
alone therell be no trouble if not there
will be

  what kind of trouble mr dade
  youll see when it comes

  very well said casey now lis-
ten to me mr dade you and your
friend there and your whole outfit can
go plumb get that  every ranch
here has water and were going to
keep it how we keep it is our own
business if youve bought land you
may look to the company for water and
not to us if you havent bought land
-if youre hired to come here to start
something-why let it start

  he and dade looked straight into
each others eyes in the silence that fol-
lowed cross made a sudden move-
ment

  be careful partner mchale
warned him in hard tones

  once more clyde an involuntary lis-
tener felt the presence of a crisis the
chill of fate impending but as before
it passed

  youre barking up the wrong tree
said dade nothing starts-now bet-
ter remember what i told you come
on sam well get going

  clyde heard the trample of hoofs dy-
ing in the distance and then mchales
voice

  you run the bluff but you took an
precious water



awful chance that there cross come
mighty close to making a break
nervous kind

  yep hes apt to be too blamed
soon tother one dade is cold-
drawn i judge hes bad ever hear of
him 

  no

  nor me said mchale but he has
the earmarks

  caseys reply was lost as they turned
away clyde waited until they were out
of sight and then descended the
morning adventure had given her food
for thought until then she had been
deceived by the smooth current of life
at chakchak it had seemed an idyllic
carefree existence although she had
known of the trouble it had seemed far
in the background it was a skeleton
which had not obtruded itself now
by accident she had surprised it stalk-
ing abroad in the glare of day

  that afternoon she and casey rode
together he was in his usual spirits
laughing joking full of whimsical
good humor but back of it she
thought she detected a preoccupation
occasionally he would be silent and his
eyes would narrow as if he were work-
ing out some problem

  far up beneath the shoulder of a
butte a little spring of delicious water
bubbled from the gravelly soil trickled
a few hundred yards and disappeared
it was hidden by willow and cotton-
wood draped with greenery an oasis
here they dismounted drank the sweet
spring water watered the horses and
rested clyde sat down leaning against
a convenient tree casey stretched him-
self against another his hands clasped
behind his head a long thin cigar
clenched between his teeth

  through the fragrant smoke he eyed
his companion in lazy content noting
how the mottled sunlight filtering
through the leaves touched her glori-
ous hair to living coppery gold

  did ycm ever have your picture
painted  he asked suddenly

  why no she replied whatever
made you think of that

  your hair and the sunlight on it

if i were a painter i should like to paint
you now-and keep the picture

  the first compliment you have ever
paid me she laughed pleased never-
theless i shall remember it

  and thats a compliment to me he
responded funny what we recollect
and what we dont there doesnt seem
to be any rule for it but i think i
shall always remember just how you
look at this moment

  thats very nice

  i wonder if i may ask you some-
thing without offending you

  i dont think you would ask any-
thing that should offend me

  thanks  its this i want to make
things pleasant for you all ive been
wondering in my own mind why you
came here you wont misunderstand
me but why

  have you forgotten your invita-
tion 

  no but its acceptance was an un-
expected piece of luck there isnt
much here to amuse you whats the
real reason 

  she looked full at him and then
dropped her eyes her fingers plucked
blades of grass and cast them aside

  i dont think i know the answer
she replied at last for one thing i
thought i might help you-if youd let
me

  help me  how  

  with money you and the others
good lord he ejaculated what-
ever put that in your head 

  the only letter you ever wrote me

i	could read between the lines after-
ward mr wade told me more but he
wouldnt take what i offered

  i should say not-if you offered
money he was right

  do you mean that you wouldnt let
me help you if you needed money
certainly i wouldnt

  because im a woman i suppose
partly but i wouldnt let any one
throw money away on what is apt to be
a losing game

  you think it that

  size it up for yourself you talked
with wade didnt he tell you so
practically yes


thb popular magazinb

  then you see it wouldnt do at
all

  but its my money i can afford to
lose it ill not have a pleasure or a
luxury the less and this is my pleas-
ure would you refuse me this one
thing you lent me money

  ten dollars-pshaw this is dif-
ferent im more grateful than i can
tell you but theres no necessity-just
yet anyway

  then i wont consider it a definite
refusal that was one reason why i
came and then i wanted to see your
country i wanted something new i
cant explain it very well i had to
come something made me

  she flushed but the eyes that met his
inquiring gaze were entirely steady

  something made me if the wades
had not been coming i should have come
alone im frank with you you see
yes i understand the feeling
casey said ive had it myself ive
had to get out of old surroundings
sometimes and ive always gone
sometimes it has turned out well some-
times not

  we shall see how this turns out
she said with a nod and a little laugho
ive a feeling that i shall bring you
luck

  i believe you will he agreed
well say so anyway just now i
wouldnt trade places with any man on
earth

  she laughed in pure pleasure bend-
ing tpward him i appropriate that to
myself dont dare to explain it do
you come here often

 not very often that maze of
coulee and butte you see is a good cattle
range i come this way looking for
strays the last time i was here sheila
mccrae was with me

  suddenly for clyde the sunlight lost
its golden charm in an altered tone
she said

  indeed and she added deliber-
ately i dont think i ever met a nicer
girl than miss mccrae

  no nicer anywhere he agreed
heartily well perhaps wed better be
moving we have a long ride yet

   their way led by devious cattle trails

along coulees over ridges into other
coulees clyde lost all idea of direc-
tion but her companion wras never at a
loss and finally they emerged upon a
broad well-traveled trail then clyde
after much inward debate told casey of
her presence that morning at the inter-
view with dade and cross

  well theyre quite a pair said
casey they came to run some sortof
a bluff but concluded not to push it to
a show-down theyll make trouble for
us i suppose theyre simply hired
men and thats their job

  what kind of trouble 

  i wish i knew he replied shaking
his head

  is it all worth while she asked
i havent asked a question about the
blown-up dam and the cut ditches im
not going to but where will it end
you admit that there may be violence-
even bloodshed why not avoid it
how

  by letting the courts settle it

  if we could have our water till then
thats what wed do as it is-well im
afraid we cant afford to

 ive already offered-

  i know i know he interrupted
but thats out of the question 
that evening dragged there were
long silences nobody seemed inclined
to talk wade went to sleep in his
chair his cigar dropping from his relax-
ing fingers he grumbled when his
wife woke him

  im dead sleepy im going to bed
im too sleepy to care whether its polite
or not im all in

 so am i said kitty yawning
frankly i shall follow my lord and
master

  and i my amiable chaperon said
clyde

  im afraid all i have to follow is an
example said casey he came close
to her in the moonlight perhaps i
seemed ungrateful this afternoon i
didnt mean to be i cant tell you how
much i appreciated your offer your
generosity none the less because i cant
possibly accept it

  it is nothing she said it is not
precious wjter



even generosity real generosity must
cost something in renunciation

  no he replied the cost has little
to do with it it is the spirit of the
offer that counts dont belittle it

  it cost me something to make the
offer she said impulsively the
money would have been the least part
of it

  i dont think i understand

  im glad you dont and i cant ex-
plain now some day perhaps and
now-good night

  he took her hand and looked down
into her eyes he could feel the hand
tremble slightly but the eyes were
steady darkened by the moonlight
they seemed unfathomable pools deep
mysterious holding something which he
could almost but not quite discern in
the pale light her face lost color it was
idealized purified the face of a dream
her marvelous crown of hair shone
strand by strand as of twisted gold it
shimmered with halolike glory her
slightly parted lips vivid against the
white of the face seemed to invite him

  he bent forward and plucked him-
self angrily back from the temptation
she released her hand

  good night she said softly

  good night he responded hesi-
tated and turned away to his own
quarters

  but as clyde sought her room she
seemed to walk on air she trembled
in every fiber of her strong young body
but her blood sang in her veins the
woman within her called aloud trium-
phantly it was long before she slept
and when she did so her slumber was a
procession of dreams

  she awoke somewhere in the night
with a strange sound in her ears a det-
onation distant but thunderous she
rose went to the window and peered
out v

  as she stood she commanded a view
of casey dunnes quarters the door
opened and two men emerged running
for the stables it seemed not a minute
till two horses were led out ready sad-
dled the two men went up instantly
they tore past her window in a flurry
of hoofs she recognized casey dunne

  and mchale neither was completely
dressed but around the waist of each
was a holster-weighted belt and across
each saddle was slanted a rifle be-
cause of these warlike manifestations
clyde slept no more that night

chapter xix

  as the night air vibrated with the
first explosion casey dunne and mc-
hale leaped from their beds and rushed
for the door opened it and stood listen-
ing there they heard another and an-
other

  dynamite cried mchale reaching
for his clothes ill bet its our dam
jump into some pants casey theres
just a chance to get a sight of some-
body

  they threw on clothes with furious
haste caught up weapons and raced for
the stables their haste communicated
itself to their horses which bolted be-
fore the riders were firm in the saddles
casey as they tore past the house
thought he caught a glimpse of white at
clydes window but just then he had
his hands full with shiner who was ex-
pressing his disapproval of such un-
seemly hours by an endeavor to accom-
plish a blind runaway

  halfway to the river they came upon
the first evidence of dynamite in the
form of a bit of wrecked fluming
water poured down a sidehill from a
mass of shattered boards and broken
displaced timbers they scarcely paused
to view the ruin but rode for the dam
there was no dam where it had been
remained onhr a few forlorn and twisted
posts between which the muddied water
whispered softly the work had been
very complete mchale swrore into the
night

  our own medicine well watch us
take it we aint like boys that cant
build a little thing like a dam which
way do you reckon them fellers went

  try the old ford said casey its
all chance anyway

a mile downstream they came to the
ford where the river for a brief dis-
tance had broadened and shallowed
fresh tracks of one horse led down to


the popular magazine

the waters edge on the other side
where they emerged they were still
filled with muddy water

  thats the cuss that blowed the
flume said mchale hes met up
with another one or two here theyve
gone on downstream but we sure cant
trail them in this light what do we
do

  ride ahead and trust to luck said
casey its all we can do

  i guess thats so mchale agreed

but if we run up on em-

  he paused abruptly out of the dis-
tance came the unmistakable sound of a
blast closely followed by a second

  another dam casey exclaimed
thats oscars or wyndhams our
own medicine sure enough

  if i can put a gunsight onto one of
them fellers ill fix him sos he wont
hold medicine nohow said mchale
savagely no use followin the river
theyll quit it now and strike for some-
wheres lets take a chance and hike
out sorter southeast its as good as
any other way

  they struck southeast at a steady jog
angling away from the river the night
was absolutely cloudless the moon
near the full bathed the landscape in a
flood of white light which threw objects
into startling relief but intensified the
shadows beneath it the land slum-
bered in a silence broken only by the
soft drumming of hoofs but for an
occasional small band of cattle lying
quietly on the slopes it seemed devoid
of life

  they rode in silence but with eyes
and ears keenly alert at the top of
each rise they paused to search the sur-
rounding country now and then they
drew up to listen but their watchful-
ness availed nothing

  looks like were out o luck mc-
hale observed finally

  looks that way casey admitted
all the same well keep going

  if we happen across em mchale
continued i spose we round em up 
of course but they may take some
rounding

  sure only ill tell you casey im

  awful tired of having it put all over me
by fellers that aint got no license to
some of these gents that allow theyre
hard citizens aint so dog-goned much i
spose they figure on us peaceable farm-
ers bein bluffed out by a hard face and
a hostile talk thats an awful bad bet
for em to make

  they were approaching a region of
broken ground carved and ridged with
coulees and low hills worthless save for
range purposes there casey decided
that he would turn back at best it was
like looking for the proverbial needle in
a haystack chance only could serve
them suddenly mchale checked his
horse

  listen he said sharply

  they were riding by the base of a
low hill at one side the ground sloped
away in a shallow depression which
marked the head of a coulee as they
sat listening intently the stillness was
broken by a hollow muffled sound the
unmistakable trampling of hoofs faint
at first it increased in volume plainly
horses were coming up the draw

  four horsemen came into view they
were riding carelessly slouching in their
saddles one struck a match to light
a pipe the flame of it showed for an
instant above his cupped hands at a
hundred yards they pcrceived the wait-
ing horsemen and halted abruptly

  you there casey hailed we
want to talk to you

  a vicious oath came as answer dis-
tinct in the stillness then you get
back and mind your own business
mchales rifle action clicked and
clashed as he levered a cartridge from
magazine to chamber up with your
hands the bunch of you he ordered
or-

  the remainder was lost in the bark of
a gun as one of the other party fired
mchales horse jumped as though
stung just as he pulled the trigger
bumping into shiner immediately that
uncertain quadruped wheeled and
kicked at him so quick was his pivot-
ing motion that casey was almost un-
seated he saved himself but lost his
rifle which fell to the ground with a
furious curse and a jerk of the bit tie
precious wmte



wheeled shiner around drawing his au-
tomatic belt gun

  but the four strangers had taken ad-
vantage of the incident to turn and
plunge back into the coulee they were
almost out of sight caseys gun spat a
continuous jet of flame across the night
the rapid reports blending into a roll of
sound mchale cursing his unsteady
horse fired again and again but the
strangers apparently unhurt swept out
of sight

  casey leaped to the ground secured
his rifle and was back in the saddle
again in an instant they sailed into
the shallow head of the coulee at a dead
run casey struggling to refill the clip
of his automatic mchale cursing his
horse and himself because he had used
the rifle instead of his six-shooter

  at its head the coulee was merely a
slight depression farther on it broad-
ened and deepened down the middle
of its length ran a sinuous grove of
cottonwoods on either side its flanks
were bare white with clay and alkali
rising to steep banks of yellow earth
bald and bleached in the moonlight 
through this natural theater thun-
dered pursuers and pursued the lat-
ter had secured a good lead the wind-
ings of the coulee hid them from view

  suddenly casey became aware that
there was no one ahead-that he and
mchale were riding madly to no pur-
pose at the same moment the latter
made the like discovery their horses
hoofs slid and cut grooves in the earth
as the riders dragged them to a halt
usually considerate in the excitement
of the moment they used the brutal
methods of the buster

  theyve doubled back on us  cried
mchale cut through them cotton-
woods somewheres and let us go by
a-hellin fooled us by glory like we
was a pair of hide-an-go-seek kids
yes-there they go now look up bv
the top past that cut bank he lifted
his rifle as he spoke

  high up at the coulees rim some
hundreds of yards away figures moved
at that distance even in the brilliant
moonlight details wtere lost the eye
could discern black spots merely but it
b

seemed that the men had dismounted
for the ascent and were helping the
horses to scramble upward

  mchale fired shoved down the lever
drew it home and fired again since
the light did not serve to show the dust
puffs of the bujlets he could not telt
whether he was shooting high or low
the main thing was that he did not hit
casey chimed in the bluffs and banks
echoed to the reports of the high-pow-
ered rifles but the figures gained the
rim and vanished immediately after-
ward a tongue of flame leaped from the
spot where they were last seen and a
bullet sang in close proximity to caseys
head they wheeled into the shelter of
the trees wrhere the shadows effectually
concealed their whereabouts at short
intervals bullets searched for their posi-
tion mchale bit large consolation and
spat in disgust

  i reckon its a get-away he said
i aint fool enough to go up that bank
while theyre there and by the time
wed get around theyd be a couple of
miles most anywheres

  weve got ourselves to blame said
casey

  well that first shot burned up this
cayuse of mine mchale grumbled
how could i shoot writh him jumpin
around and that blasted yeller-hided
buzzard head of yours he dont know
no bettern to whale into him with both
heels it wouldnt happen again not in
a million years

  it doesnt need to said casey sour-
ly we found our meat and we
couldnt stop it

  the laugh is on us mchale ad-
mitted for the powder we burned we
sure ought to have a scalp or two to
show still moonlight shootin is chance
shootin and when a cussed mean cay-
use is sashayin round if a man hits
anything but scenery hes lucky 

  i thought that old-timer dade was
doing the talking

  sure he was and ill bet it was his
tillikum cross that took the first crack
at us didnt waste no time hes
some soon that feller i spose they got
a camp somewheres no use try in to


the cpocpuljlcr magazine

find it we cant prove that they used
the powder on our dams well what
say if we point out for home day-
lights breakin now

  a pale light was spreading in the east
underneath the stars that rimmed the
horizon objects became more visible
as they rode unmolested from the cou-
lee the pale light began to flush faintly
rosy shafts shot upward and the stars
vanished here and there birds began
to twitter an old grouse scuttled
away wings a-trail as if mortally hurt
to distract attention from her young
brood hidden in the short grass a
huge owl sailed ghostlike on silent
wings homeward bound from midnight
foray a coyote yipped shrill protest
against the day away to the west
where the mountains loomed grandly
bright lights lay on peaks still white
with the remnants of winter snows
suddenly driving the shadows before
it the sun seemed to leap above the rim
of the worid

chapter xx

  during the next twelve hours there
was much riding from ranch to ranch
of all the small dams constructed and
maintained by the ranchers for irriga-
tion purposes but one remained and
that one was donald mccraes

  mccrae himself considered this an
invidious distinction he would have
preferred to suffer with his neighbors
he did not know why his structure had
been spared and he lent men and teams
to others laboring hard himself in the
task of rebuilding

  the temper of the ranchers was at
the breaking point naturally the blame
fell on farwell he was the villain of
the piece he had expected unpopular-
ity but he had no idea of the depth of
it the black looks he met did not dis-
turb him in the least nor to do him
justice would he have been seriously
alarmed if he had known that more
than one man was quite ready to pick a
deadly quarrel with him for some
time he had not seen sheila mccrae
but he found himself thinking of her
constantly and so one evening he
rode over to talapus

  somewhat to his relief neither mc-
crae nor sandy were visible mrs mc-
crae was calmly civil her manner
gave no hint that he was unwelcome
sheila she told him had gone for a
walk somewhere along the ditch

  oh said farwell with elaborate
carelessness then i think ill just stroll
along and meet her

  at the end of ten minutes walk he
came upon the girl she was sitting
her chin propped on her hands beside
the stream where a little bordering
grove of willows had sprung up the
deep murmur of the running water muf-
fled his footsteps so that she neither saw
nor heard him till he was at her side
good evening he said

  she turned her head slowly without
start or exclamation

   i did not expect to see you mr far-
well

  i thought id run over he said
awkwardly i intended to come be-
fore

  she allowed a long minute of silence
to lie between them and why have
you come now  she asked

  why farwell repeated the word
why i wanted to see you why
shouldnt i come 

  you ought to know why its one
thing to do your work  but its quite an-
other to blow up our dams

  why do you think i did that 
because i have ordinary common
sense i dont suppose you did it with
your own hand but youve brought in
a bunch of toughs and gunmen to over-
awe us and do your dirty work it will
lead to serious trouble

  i can handle trouble said farwell
grimly has anybody meddled with
your dam 

  no

  then i dont see what you have to
complain of i dont admit anything
but when you get indignant at blowing
up dams you ought to remember what
happened to ours

  oh as for that-she shrugged her
shoulders we had to have water
nobody blamed you before but these
dams that did you no harm-thats dif-
ferent
precious water



 but you have water your own
dam is all right he insisted

  yes and do you know what people
are saying they say that the reason
is because we have some sort of an un-
derstanding with you they say-

she stopped abruptly

  what else do they say

  other things ive told you enough
  what do you care 

  well i do care this is the only
house you come to your visits must
end now

  end farwell echoed i guess not
not unless you absolutely forbid me to
come and then i dont know id find
it pretty hard

  nonsense

  i tell you i would he protested
you dont know

  bosh were not so fascinating as
that

  now farwell was of the battle-ax
type he was accustomed to take what
he wanted to smash through opposition
he looked at the girl facing him in the
fading light and a great desire swelled
within him her words gave the needed
spur to his courage and he went to the
point s he would have gone in to quell
a riot in a camp

   we  he said whos talking of
we im not i come to see you you
ought to know that of course you
know it i didnt think id ever fall in
love but i have you might as well
know it now i dont know whether
you think anything of me or not it
would be just my hick if you didnt
anyway thats how i feel and im not
going to give up seeing you just be-
cause some people have set a crazy yarn
going

  the words boiled out of him like
steam from a hot spring he scowled
at ker ferociously his eyes hot and an-
gry it would have been difficult to im-
agine a more unloverlike attitude and
yet she had no doubt of his sincerity
she would have been less than woman
if she had not suspected his feelings be-
fore but she had not expected this
outbreak

  im sorry  said that she told
him quietly its quite impossible i

can tell rou now what i couldnt tell
you before people sar that i have
promised to marry you in exchange for
your promise that we shall have water
for the ranch

  if - tell me the name of a man
who utters an infernal lie like that ill
wiring his neck he growled

  i believe you wtould but what good
wrould it do  you cant fight rumors
and gossip in that way thats the
trouble with -you depend on force
alone cant rou see the position this
puts us in-puts me in you cant
come here any more

  i dont see that at all he objected
ill blow up our dam myself if ou
think it will help but as for not seeing
you-why its out of the question ive
got to see you im going to see you
i cant help it i tell you i think of you
all the time why hang it sheila i
think of you when i ought to be think-
ing of my work

  she would have laughed if she had
not seen that he was in deadly earnest
his work was a fetish all-absorbing
demanding and receiving the tribute of
his entire attention and energ that
thought of a woman should come be-
tween him and it was proof positive of
devotion extraordinary

  you must not do that she aid
gently

  but i cant help it he reiterated
its new to me this i cant concen-
trate  my work i keep thinking of
you if that isnt being in love what
in thunder is im talking to you as
straight as id talk to a man i believe
i love xou as much as any woman wras
ever loved you ont know much
about me but im considered a good
man in my profession from a mate-
rial point of view im all right

  if i cared for you tha would be the
last thing id think of

  why cant you care for me he de-
manded i dont expect much wed
get along

  no she said decidedly no its
impossible were comparatively stran-
gers i think youre going to be a big
man some day i rather admire you in
some wars but that is all


the popular magazine

  well anyway im not going to
quit he announced doggedly t never
gave up anything yet sheila you talk
as if it didnt matter maybe it doesnt
to you but it does to me you dont
know how much i care i cant tell you
either this talk isnt my line look
here though about ten years ago
down in the desert of the southwest my
horse broke his leg and i was set afoot
i nearly died of thirst before i got out
all those blistering days while i stum-
bled along in that baking hell i kept
thinking of a cool spring we had on our
place when i was a boy it bubbled up
in moss at the foot of a big cedar and
i used to lie fiat and drink till i couldnt
hold any more it was the sweetest
water in the world all those days i
tortured myself by thinking of it id
have given my soul if i have one to
satisfy my thirst at that spring and
thats how i feel about you i wrant
your love as i wanted that water

  im very sorry she said its out
of the question

  but why he demanded give me
a chance im not a monster or do
you mean that you care for somebody
else is that it do you care any-
thing for that dunne  a fellow thats
in love with another woman

  even in the dying light he could see
the dark flush that surged over cheek
and brow she rose to the full height
of her lithe figure facing him

  no i dont she flamed but if i
did what business would it be of yours
casey dunne is my friend-a gentleman
-which is more than you seem to be
mr far well

  she took a step toward him in her in-
dignation suddenly with a sweep of
his arm he clipped her to him kissing
her on forehead and cheek she struck
him in the face with her clenched fist
driven by muscles as hard as an ath-
letes

  you great brute she panted

  with the blow and the words far-
wells moment of madness passed he
held her from him at arms length

  a brute he said youre right
i didnt know it before now i do
how can i put myself right with you

  let me go  she cried

  as he released her she heard the
quick pad of running feet ottt of the
dusk behind her bounded young sandy
mccrae he came like a young wolf
to its first kill his lips lifted in a snarl
in his right hand lay a long-barreled
black colts

  sheila he cried whats the mat-
ter whos this what in-ah

  the gun leaped up instinctively she
threw out her hand striking it as he
pulled the trigger a thin stream of
flame blazed almost into farwells face
and the sharp report split the evening
silence into fragments something like
a questing finger of death ran through
his hair and his hat twitched from his
head to flutter down softly ten feet
away but he was unhurt

  sheila locked both arms around her
brothers dragging it down

  no no no she cried i tell you
no sandy dont shoot again its a
mistake

  he wrenched furiously to free his
hand mistake he shouted he
was holding you i saw him i heard
you let go ill blow his heart out
but she clung to his arm its a mis-
take sandy i tell you cant you un -
derstand me  dont use that gun i
wont let you give it to me

  he ceased his attempts to free his
arm all right sheila i wont shoot
-this time you farwell what have
you got to say for yourself 

  mighty little farwell replied i
asked your sister to marry me and she
refused i kissed her against her will
thats all-and plenty if you want my
opinion i think i ought to be shot
sandy glared at him taken aback by
this frank admission

  if she hadnt jolted my hand you
sure would have been he said grimly
youre mighty lucky to be alive right

now after this if i see you-

  shut up sandy sheila interrupted
authoritatively with sisterly directness
im quite able to look after my own
affairs mr farwell is sorry you be
white enough to let it go that way
its up to you if you want it sandy
precious water



replied if you can stand far a thing
tike that once i can but not twice
there wont be any twice shall we
go to the house mr farwell

  farwell amazed fell into step with
her he had expected to be over-
whelmed with reproaches to face a
storm of feminine anger still he could
not think that she was palliating his of-
fense  and he was quite aware that she
had saved his life young mccrae in
offended dignity stalked in front

  i want you to know said farwell
that im utterly ashamed of myself to
prove it im going to do the best i can
im going to wire in my resignation
and im going away

  dont

  what he exclaimed incredulously
dont you are sorry and thats the
main thing we wont mention it
again and neither will sandy but
for a while you must not come here
ill do anything he said i think
you are the best girl on earth

  sheila did not reply but she did not
reprove him

 mrs mccrae looking somewhat
anxious met them at the house

  i heard a shot she said was it
you sandy

  yes her son replied

  what did you shoot at

  the young man glanced at farwell
from the corner of his eye

  a skunk he replied i missed
him

  sheila bit her lip angrily farwell
took his medicine in silence

chapter xxi

  a week sufficed to put the ranchers
ditches and dams in condition to take
care of water but at the end of that
time there was little water to take care
of it was being diverted into the com-
panys ditch system their ditches
were running full emptying upon lands
on which scarcely a pretense of cultiva-
tion was being made while the actual
farmers just when they needed it most
had each barely sufficient water for
their domestic purposes for stock and

for their small gardens there was
none for the main crops in the fields

  naturally the crops suffered the
grain most of all a series of hot dry
winds came with water they would
have done little or no damage without
it the leaves curled shriveled and
turned pale starving for lack of mois-
ture and the peculiarly galling feature
of it was that the water which would
have meant so much was practically
running to waste

  in spite of these troubles casey man-
aged to devote time to his guests his
projected excursion to the foothills was
abandoned but he and clyde rode al-
most daily he had reserved his lit-
tle gray mare dolly for her use and
she was becoming if not expert at
least confident in the saddle

  she grew to love the long evenings
the soft twilights the warm sweet
scent of the grasses and the great still-
ness broken only by an occasional word
and the beat of willing hoofs on these
evening rides she allowed her imagina-
tion to run riot it pleased her to pre-
tend that she and casey were the only
inhabitants of the land-an eve and
adam of the west pioneers of a re-
mote civilization all day she looked
forward to this hour or two at night
in her bed she lived them over recreat-
ing each mile each word each little
thing-how the great owl had sailed
ghostly across their path the gray
shape of a coyote fading into the dusk
the young broods of grouse hiding in
the grass

  occasionally she undertook to ana-
lyze her feelings toward casey dunne
but the result was indefinite she en-
joyed his companionship looked for-
ward to it remembered his words his
tricks of manner and speech but these
things she told herself were not con-
clusive

  his sentiments she had no means of
judging he was forever doing little
things to please her but then he did as
much for others at times he was con-
fidential  but he seldom talked of him-
self his confidences taking the form of
allowing her to share his private view-
point revealing to some extent his


the popular magazine

mental processes but he had never
said one word which indicated more
than friendship

  clyde saw little of sheila mccrae
the latter had ridden over once or
twice to see as she said how casey
was treating them on these occasions
clyde experienced a recurrence of
latent hostility sheila took no pains
whatever with her appearance she
came in a worn riding costume plain
serviceable workmanlike and she
talked water and crops and stock with
casey and mchale avoiding more
feminine topics if there was any un-
derstanding between her and casey it
did not appear to clyde but it was
this unreasoning hostility more than
anything else which made clyde doubt
herself was it she wondered in
reality jealousy

  she put the thought from her indig-
nantly but it refused to be banished
she even catalogued her attractions
comparing them with the other girls
the balance was in her favor but in
the end she felt ashamed of herself
why should she do this she found
no satisfactory reply

  after a week of the water famine
she saw a change in her host he was
more silent  thoughtful often when
they rode together he had nothing to
say staring at the horizon with nar-
rowed eyes

  do you ever tell anybody your trou-
bles she asked abruptly one evening
they were riding slowly homeward
and the silence had been especially
marked

  not very often casey replied
people ive met have usually had
enough of their own they didnt want
to hear mine

  well i havent many troubles and
id like to share yours if i may i sup-
pose its this water question

  why yes he admitted its get-
ting to be a mighty hard thing to swal-
low-and look pleasant

  i know she nodded sympatheti-
cally you feel helpless

  not that exactly the difficulty is
to know just what to do-whether to
do anything or not the boys are very

hostile it wouldnt take much to start
them

  in what direction

  in any that would give action
theyd like nothing better than open
war

  she exclaimed at the words sure-
ly theres no possibility of that
more than a possibility he re-
turned gravely water is a necessity
to us the people who have taken it do
not require it they have established
what is practically an armed camp
also they have brought in a number of
hard citizens-what are known as gun-
men-to overawe us these patrol
their ditch system and warn us to keep
away from it it is guarded at every
important point not satisfied with
this some of these fellows have been
apparently looking for trouble in town
and elsewhere one of these fine days
they will get it

  he shook his head forebodingly
they topped a rise as he spoke below
them lay the line of the companys main
canal as they rode down to it a man
on a horse seemed to appear from no-
where in particular and came toward
them as he drew nearer casey rec-
ognized the man cross

  cross ised his hat in acknowledg-
ment of clydes presence but his
words to casey were very much to the
point

  you got notice to keep off this prop-
erty said he

  well said casey

  do it said cross hike-meanin
you understand and not the lady shes
plumb welcome to ride where she likes
i savvy your game dunne you aint
got nerve enough to ride out here alone
and you bring a woman with you to
play safe

  casey paled with anger beneath his
tan mr cross he said quietly that
goes-because the lady is with me but
i rather think that one of us will stay
in this country a long time

  cheap bluff cross sneered you
aint goin to prospect round these
ditches linin them up for powder
come here alone and ill make you eat
the sights off of my gun
precious water



  casey laughed softly-with him most
dangerous of signs

  mr cross you really amuse me i
wont argue the point just now later
perhaps good evening

  clyde had listened in amazement
once more she had experienced the sen-
sation of standing on the brink of trag-
edy once more it had failed to oc-
cur

  and thats one of the gunmen said
casey thats what we have been put-
ting up with i think it will have to
stop

  dont get into any trouble she
begged promise me you wont what
do you care what men like that say
im partly human he replied grim-
ly i can stand as much as most men
but there are some things i wont stand
im not going to climb a tree for any
man however i wont crowd things
with cross though i know plenty of
men who would on that provocation
im all for peace and a quiet life you
wont think im afraid i hope

  certainly not she said indignantly
you dont give me much of your con-
fidence but i know you better than to
think such a thing i wish you would
tell me more of what is going on let
me be your friend and not merely your
guest talk to me as you would to-
miss mccrae

  it was the first time she had spoken
to him of sheila it was her challenge
she would be on the same footing

  sheilas different he replied
sheilas one of us ive known her
for years shes a good deal like a sis-
ter

  oh she said a sister

  to have saved her immortal soul she
could not have kept the note of inter-
rogation from the word he laughed 
yes a sister why great scott
you didnt think i was in love with her
did you just because i call her by her
first name i think everything of her
but not in that way shes a thousand
times too good for me besides she
knows me too well thats usually fatal
to sentiment thats why no man is a
hero to his wife

  how do you know he isnt kitty
wade simply worships her husband
maybe but ill bet his pedestal
isnt nearly so high as it was before they
were married when you marry miss
burnaby-he smiled at her frankly-
you will occupy the pedestal yourself
doesnt your rule work both ways
she laughed

  i wont admit it-to you anyway
  why not-to me 

  because wade tells me no man can
be forced to incriminate himself he
replied

  clyde glanced at him swiftly flushing
in the dusk but she did not press for
an explanation she was satisfied she
was no longer jealous of sheila mc-
crae

  when they arrived at the ranch
dunne took the horses to the stables
clyde entering the house found wade
alone deep in newspapers the accumu-
lation of a wreek which he had just re-
ceived there wras a package of let-
ters for clyde

  look here clyde said the lawyer
heres a funny thing he held a
newspaper open at the market page
this western air-line stock is as
jumpy as a fever chart for a while it
went down and down and down away
below what i should think to be its in-
trinsic value there was a rumor of a
passed dividend nothing definite-
merely a rumor then came another
rumor of an application for a charter
for a competing line both these
stories seem to have brought out con-
siderable stock there was heavy sell-
ing likely the traders went short ill
bet some of them were nipped too for
the market went up without warning-
ves by george bounced like a rubber
ball

  clyde looked up from a letter which
inclosed a formal-loolcing statement
what would send it up

  buyers in excess of sellers-in other
words demand in excess of supply
wade responded thats on the face
of it probably not half a dozen men
know the inside orders may have
been issued to support the stock-that
is to buy all offered in order to keep


the popular magazine

the price from declining farther its
hard to say at this distance its pos-
sible that the depressing rumors may
have originated with the very men who
are now supporting the stock

  why should they do that

  to buy more cheaply shares which
would be offered in consequence its
funny though he continued opening
another paper now heres a later
date-lets see-yes here we are the
market opened five points higher than
it closed on the preceding day and it
closed ten points above that opening
holy moses do you know what that
means

  demand in excess of supply
demand supply wade echoed
contemptuously economics be
hanged it means a fight for western
air it means that somebody is will-
ing to pay a fancy price for shares
wrhy because a few shares one way
or the other means the ownership of the
road the dictation of its policy theres
no other explanation i wonder who
is-

  look at this said clyde she
handed him a telegram he read

  sell nothing whatever until you hear from
me instruct bradley  gauss	jim

  wades lips puckered in a noiseless
whistle he did not need to be told
that jim was clydes uncle wily old
jim hess of the hess system it was
he who was out gunning for york and
western air and he had the reputation
of getting what he went after what
his tactics had been wrade could only
surmise but the antics of the stock
were proof that he was in earnest

  well he queried what do you
know about this young lady have you
been holding out on me

  i havent much information she
replied bradley  gauss are my
brokers they have been buying west-
ern air for me as it was offered
theres their statement uncle jim told
me to buy it-said that it ought to be
worth as much as hess system some
day

  heavens what a tip wade ex-

claimed this will be good news for
casey

  i dont want him to know

  why not 

  well he-he-that is he might be
disappointed uncle jim may not get
control if he does hell treat every-
body fairly of course i dont want to
raise false hopes

  considerate of you said wade
not to say ingenious

  she flushed angrily for a moment
and then laughed

  its all the reason youll get be a
good friend do promise also you
are to say nothing to kitty

  afraid of being jollied

  mr wade you are impertinent
but her eyes laughed at him

  ill keep your dark secret said
wade it will be a joke on kitty
and so casey dunne was left in igno-
rance

chapter xxii

  tom mchale ambled into coldstream
one afternoon and dropped his ponys
reins behind the station thence he
clanked his spurs into mr quiltys
sanctum that gentleman nodding
somnolently above a blackened clay
pipe rolled an appraising eye at him

  fwhere in hivens name is the mas-
kyrade at  he queried sourly an do
yez riprisint wild bill hickox-rest his
sowl-or th pache kid-th divil burn
him

  tom glanced down at his ancient re-
galia of worn leather chaps spurs and
the old forty-one that sagged from his
right hip and grinned

  guns is coming into style again out
our way he replied all the best
families wears em theres so many
of these here durn hobos and railway
men and irish and other low characters

  th nerve of yez snorted mr
quilty and the name iv yez mc-
hale -as irish be hivins as con iv

  mchale chuckled to himself having
succeeded in his purpose of getting mr
quilty going
pcrecious wter



  irish not on your life he denied
gravely what put that notion in
your head the mchales is high-grade
scotch always was they come
from loch lomond or commarashin-
dhu or them parts annie laurie mar-
ried a mchale of course were

the only mchale that ever was in ire-
land went there to civilize it

about bare to th four winds ivhivin a
barbarious race lower nor a digger in-
jun a scandal to god man and fay-
males black and white

  well maybe youre right about them
old times corney admitted mchale
with an innocent face i meant a lit-
tle later than that this here mchale
was with william the conqueror at the

battle of the boyne-

  mr quilty spat at the mention of this
historic event

  bad cess till him then he ex-
claimed yez do be a high-grade liar

qror was irish on his mothers side an
he bate th heads off iv th bloody sas-
senach an soaked their king wan in thy

mchale who was enjoying himself
hugely sifted tobacco into paper

  i wont say you aint right corney
he observed mildly i always under-
stood we was scotch but i aint noways
bigoted about it that hangin business
seems to point to us bein irish did
you ever notice how many irishmen is
hanged of course theres lots aint

that ought to be but the general aver-
age is sure high

  i hope to glory ye boost it wan
higher yerself quilty retorted small
loss twud be to anny wan a divil
iv a desprado yez are wid yer gun an
all im a good mind to swipe yez over
th nut wid me lanthern an take ut
away from yez

  mchale drew the weapon gently and
spun it on his finger checking the revo-
lutions six times with startling sudden-
ness mr quilty watched him sourly

  play thricks he commented spin
a gun huh why dont yez get a
job wid a dhrama that shows the west
as it used to wasnt i knowed wran iv
thim gun twirlers wanst he was all
fer pluggin tomatty cans an such-a
fair wonder he was but wan day he
starts to make a pinwheel iv his finger
forninst a stranger he mistakes fer a
tindherfut an he gets th face iv him
blowed in be a derringer from that same
strangers coat pocket

  sure mchale agreed it was
cornin to him he should have stuck
to tomatter cans them plays is plumb
safe

  theys no safe play wid a gun mr
quilty declared oracularly im an
owlder man nor ye an i worked me
way west wid railway construction i

he keeps at ut long enough he meets up
wid some felly that bates him till it-
wanst and wanst is enough

  plenty mchale agreed sure
the system is not to meet that sport
i dont figure hes in these parts

  mr quilty blinked at him for a mo-
ment and lowered his voice see now
by said he im strong for mindin
me own business but a winks as good
as a nod to a blind horse nobodys
been hurted hereabouts yet but keep at

the popular magazine

nothin only were some tired of hav-
in a hot iron held to our hides we
sorter hate to smell our own hair singe-
in we aint on the prod but we dont
aim to be run off our own range and
that goes as it lies

  he rose flipping his cigarette through
the open window and inquired for
freight they were expecting a binder
and a mower these had not arrived
mchale looked at the date of his bill of
lading and stated his opinion of the
railway

  be ashamed bawlin out me em-
ployers in me prisince said mr quilty
gwan out o here before i take a shot-
gun to yez

  come up and have a drink mchale
invited

  agin the rules whin on duty
quilty refused an i do be on duty
whiniver im awake tis prohibition
the compny has on me no less

  mchale rode up the straggling street
to shillers hotel and dismounted bob
shiller in shirt sleeves sat on the ve-
randa

  theys a right smart o dust to-day
bob said mchale spose we sorter
sprinkle it some

  well go into one of the back rooms
where its cooler proposed shiller

  oh id just as soon go to the bar 
said mchale might be some of the
boys there i like to lean up against the
wood

 well- shiller began and

stopped uncertainly

  well-what mchale demanded

  just as well you dont go into the
bar right now shiller explained you
had a sort of a run-in with a feller
named cross hadnt you-you or
casey hes in there with a couple of
his friends-hard-lookin nuts hes
some tankgd and shootin off his mouth
well have billy bring us what we want
where its cooler

  mchale kicked a post meditatively
three times

  theres mighty little style about me
bob he said im democratic a lot
havin drinks sent up to a private room
looks to me a heap like throwin on
dog

  i asked you said shiller its my
house the drinks are on me

  i spoke of the dust mchale re-
minded him that makes it my
drinks and then i done asked a man
to meet me in the bar i wouldnt like
to keep him waitin

  i dont want trouble here said
shiller positively i ask you in a
friendly way not to make it

  well i aint makin it am i said
mchale thats all right about not
wantin trouble but i got other things
to think of this here cross and dade
and that bunch dont run the country
mighty funny if i have to drink in a
back room for them gents next thing
youll want me to climb a tree im al-
lowin to stop my thirst facin a mirror
with one foot on a rail ill do it that
way or you and me wont be friends no
more

  go to it then said shiller you
always was a bullhead

  mchale grinned hitched his holster
forward a trifle and walked toward the
bar as he entered he took a swift
survey of its half dozen occupants

  three of them were regulars citizens
of coldstream the others were stran-
gers and each of them wore a gun
down his thigh they were of the type
known as hard-faced cross a glass
in his right hand was standing facing
the door as it pushed open he turned
his head and stared at mchale whom
he did not immediately recognize

  come on friend said he get in
on this

  sure said mchale promptly a
little number nine biliy heres a ho
he set his glass down and faced cross
come again boys whatll you take
with me

but cross swore suddenly well
he exclaimed look at what blowed in
off of one of them dry-ranch layouts
mchale smiled blandly pushing a
bottle in his direction

  beats all how some things drift
about all over the country he ob-
served tumbleweeds and such they
go rollin along mighty gay till they
bump into a wire fence somewheres
its sure a wonder to me your bos
precious watecr



lets you stray this far off said cross
with sarcasm he needs a man to look
after him the worst way he dont
seem to have  sand i met up with
him along our ditch a while back and i
told him to hike you bet he did only
that hed a girl with him id have run
him clean back to his reservation
you want to get a movin-picture
layout mchale suggested thatd
make a right good show-you runnin
casey you used to work for one of
them outfits didnt you

  no what makes you think i did
your face looked sorter familiar to
me mchale replied studyin on it
it seemed like id seen it in one of them
picture shows down in cheyenne right
good show too it showed a bunch of
boys after a hoss thief he got away
haw-haw laughed one of the
regulars and suddenly froze to silence
billy behind the bar stood as if petri-
fied towel in hand cross face flushed
with liquor blackened in a ferocious
scowl

 you ---------- - - he roared

what do you mean by that 

  mean  asked mchale innocently
why i was tellin you about a show
i seen whats wrong with that 
you called me a horse thief cried
cross

 who me said mchale why
no mr cross you aint no hoss thief
i know different if anybody says you
are you just send him right along to
me no sir i know you aint theres
two good reasons against it

  cross glared at him his fingers be-
ginning to twitch

  lets hear them he said if they
aint good you go out of that door feet
first

  theyre plumb good-best you ever
heard mchale affirmed now lis-
ten heres how i know you aint no
hoss thief for one thing you got too
much mouth and for another you aint
got the nerve

  out of the dead silence came shillers
voice from the door

  ill fill the fi rst man that makes a
move plumb full of buckshot if theres
any shootin in here im doin it my-

self he held a pump gun at his shoul-
der the muzzle dominating the group
you tom he continued you said
you wouldnt make trouble

  am i makin it asked mchale
are you makin it  shiller re-
peated oh no you aint youre a
gentle meek-and-mild pilgrim you are
i aint goin to hold this gun all day
neither you better hit the high spots
ill give you time to get on your cayuse
and drift at the end of two minutes
this man goes out of that door and i
aint responsible for what happens im
sure sorry tom to treat you like this
but i got my house to consider

  thats all right bob said mchale
looks like you hold the ace ill step
fars im concerned you neednt keep
them gents two minutes nor one he
turned to the door

  im lookin for you mchale said
cross

  come a-runnin said mchale
bring your friends

  he walked into the middle of the
road turned and waited his action
attracted little attention coldstream
was indoors somnolent with the after-
noon heat across the street the pro-
prietor of the general store commented
lazily to a friend 

  whats tom mchale doin

  some fool joke hes full of them
i reckon he wants us to ask him
mchale called to them boys if i
was you id move out of line of me
and bobs door

  what did i tell you the wise one
commented you bet i dont bite--
out of the door of shillers surged
cross gun in hand uncertain where
to find mchale he glared about then
as he saw him standing in the middle of
the road the weapon seemed to leap to
a level simultaneously i ictlale shot
from the hip

 bang bang bang

  pale-pink flashes stabbed the after-
noon light coldstream echoed to the
fusillade its inhabitants ran to doors
and windows streaming into the streets
one of the store windows suddenly
starred long lines like cracks in thin
ice appeared in it radiating from a


the popular magazine

common center the proprietor and his
friend electrified ducked and sprang
for shelter a woman screamed in
fright

  suddenly cross staggered turning
halfway around the deadly rage in
his face changed to blank wonder his
pistol arm sagged then he collapsed
gently not as a tree falls but as an
overweighted sapling bends swaying
backward until overbalanced he
thudded limply on the ground

  mchale half crouched like a fighting
animal awaiting an attack peered with
burning eyes over the hot muzzle of his
gun at the prostrate figure swiftly he
swung out the cylinder of the weapon
ejected the empty shells refilled the
chambers and snapped it shut shil-
lers door opened mchale covered it
instantly but it was shiller himself

  so you done it did you he said

  sure said mchale he comes
a-shootin and i gets him likewise i
gets them two tillikums of his if they
want it that way

  billys keepin them quiet with the
pump gun shiller informed him
you better get out o town ill clean
up your mess darn you git quick
them fellers expects some more in

  mchale nodded i aint organized
to stand off a whole posse with one gun
so long bob fm plumb sorry i mixed
you into this they wont like you
much now

  they dont need to said shiller
want any money want another gun
i got a handy little three-ought-three
carbine

  no ill get my own outfit i may
have to lie out for a spell well ill be
rnovin

  he mounted swiftly men crowding
up to the scene of the affray stopped
suddenly few of them had seen the
like before they shrank back awed
from the killer he rode down the
street gun in hand casting swift
glances right and left ready for any
attempt to stop him there was none
he vanished in the swells of brown
grasses riding at an easy lope as un-
hurried as if nothing out of the ordinary
had occurred

chapter xxiii

  tom mchale reached chakchak sta-
bled his horse made a hasty toilet and
attacked a belated supper while he
was eating with hearty appetite casey
and wade strolled in

 dm that freight come asked

asey

 nope said mchale i got a
tracer started after her

  anything doing in town

  why i reckon there wras a leetle ex-
citement there for a few minutes said
mchale sort of an argument in
front of bob shillers

  casey from his knowledge of mc-
hale came to attention at once well
he asked abruptly

  well it was me and this here
cross mchale explained i downed
him

  in the argument laughed wade
who did not comprehend but casey
asked quickly gun

  mchale nodded

  you did howd it happen is he
dead

  i miss once but three times im
pretty near center mchale replied
course i didnt wait to hold no in-
quest but if he aint forded jordans
tide by now lies plumb lucky also
tough only thing makes me doubt it
is the way he goes down he dont
come ahead on his face the way a man
does when hes plugged for keeps but
he sorter sags backward so he may have
a chance still i reckon shes a slim
one

  casey got the full story with half a
dozen brief questions

  clear case of self-defense isnt it
wade 

  looks that way if the evidence cor-
roborates what he says the lawyer re-
plied are you sulre he shot first
tom 

  better put it he meant to shoot
first mchale responded naturally
i aint standin round waitin for no
sightin shots it comes close to an even
break

  thats good enough wade de-
clared if his actions left no doubt of
precious water



his hostile purpose in your mind you
were justified in protecting yourself
they sure didnt said mchale
hes out to down me and i know it
there aint no alphonse and gaston
stuff when he comes boilin out pullin
his gun i just sail in to get action
while i got the chance

  exactly said wade well tom
youll be arrested of course if cross
isnt dead likely you can get bail if he
is im afraid youll have to remain in
custody till the trial ill defend you
myself if youll let me or maybe it
would be better to get a man whose
practice is more on the criminal side
ill get the best there is for you

  im obliged said mchale ill
stand a trial all right but i aint figurin
on bein arrested for a while

  nonsense said wade you dont
mean to resist arrest thats foolish
oh i dunno said mchale de-
pends on how you look at it i aint
goin to resist to speak of im just lyin
low for a spell i reckon ill pack old
baldy with a little outfit casey bout
two days from now youll find him out
by sunk springs if you ride that way
i dont get the idea

  its this way mchale explained
this cross is one of a bad bunch
theyll be out for my scalp they dont
want no law in this i been hearin bout
cross and this old-timer dade theyre
great tillikums and dade is the old he-
coon of the bunch i aint takin a chance
on some little tin-starred deputy stand-
in them off furthermore i figure it
aint unlikely theyll come after me some
time to-night if it was just you and me
casey we could stand the hand and
whatever hangin there was would come
off in the smoke but with women on
the place it wouldnt be right so ill
just point out for a little campin spot
somewheres and save everybody trou-
ble if any of these here sheriffs or
deputies gets nosin around you tell em
how it is ill come in when the signs
is right and not before tell them not
to go huntin me neither but to go
ahead and get everything set for a
proper trial ill send word when ill
be in

wade chuckled they cant arrange
a trial without somebody to try tom
theyll have to make a stagger at
it or wait mchale responded seri-
ously

  it was dusk when he headed west-
ward old baldy lightly packed trotting
meekly at the tail of his saddle horse

  casey coming back from a final word
with him met clyde strolling toward
the young orchard he fell into step
nice evening

  she regarded him quizzically i
wont ask a single question you
neednt be afraid

  did you think i meant to head off
your natural curiosity not a bit of it
you want to know where tom is going
at this time of night and why

  of course i do but i wont ask
you may just as well know as later
he told her what had happened omit-
ting to mention mchales real reason
for leaving the ranch even in the
darkness he could see the trouble in
her eyes

  you really mean it she questioned
you mean that he has killed a man
either that or shot him up pretty
badly

  i can scarcely believe it i like mc-
hale  hes droll humorous so cheerful
so easy-going i cant think of him as
a murderer

  nonsense said casey no mur-
der about it it was a fair gun fight-
an even break this fellow came at
tom shooting he had to protect him-
self

  he could have avoided it he had
time to get on his horse and ride away
but he waited

  he did right said casey this
man would have shot him on sight it
was best to settle it then and there
that may be so she admitted but
life is a sacred thing to me

  no doubt tom considered his own
life tolerably sacred he responded
as an abstract proposition life may be
sacred practically its about the cheap-
est thing on earth it persists and re-
peats and increases in spite of war pes-
tilence and famine the principal value
of the individual life is its service to


thb popular magazine

other life cross wasnt much good
that old holstein over there in the cor-
ral with her long and honorable record
of milk production and thoroughbred
calves is of more real benefit to the
world you see it was tom or cross
one had to go im mighty glad it was
cross

  oh if you put it that way-

  thats the way to put it of course
we arent sure that hes more than shot
up a little still knowing what tom
can do with a gun im inclined to think
that cross is all same good indian

  for some moments they walked in
silence it was rapidly becoming dark
a heavy bank of cloud blue-black in the
waning light was slowly climbing into
the northwestern sky partially obscur-
ing the last tints of the sunset the
wind had ceased the air was hot op-
pressive laden with the scents of dry
earth sounds carried far in the still-
ness the stamp of a horse in a stall
the low throaty notes of a cow nuzzling
her calf the far-off evening wail of a
coyote-all seemed strangely near at
hand borne by some telephonic quality
in the atmosphere

  how still it is said clyde one
can almost feel the darkness descend-
ing

  electrical storm coming i fancy no
such luck as rain

  i dont suppose it affects you she
remarked but out here when night
comes i feel lonely arid yet thats
scarcely the right word its more a
sense of apprehension a realization of
rhy own unimportance the country is
so vast-so empty-that i feel dwarfed
by it i believe im afraid of the big
lonely land when the darkness lies on it
of course youll laugh at me

  no he assured her i know the
feeling very well ive had it myself
not here but up where the rivers run
into the polar sea the vastness op-
pressed i wanted the company of men
and to see the things man had made
i was awred by the world lying just as it
came from the hand of god the wil-
derness seemed to press in on me
thats what drives men mad some-
times it isnt the solitude or the lone-

liness exactly its the constant pres-
sure of forces that can be felt but not
described

  i think i understand

  the ordinary person wouldnt
there are no words to express some
things

  im glad of it i dont want the
things i feel the most cheapened by
words

  something in that he agreed
words are poor things when one
really feels providence seems to have
arranged that we should be more or
less tongue-tied when we feel the most
is that the case

  i think so-with men at any rate
its especially so with most of us in
affairs of love and dea-h

  but some men make love very well
you know she smiled

  i defer to your experience he
laughed back

  oh my experience she made a
wry face and what do you know of
my experience 

  less than nothing but from some
slight observation of my fellow men i
am aware that a very pretty and
wealthy girl is in a position to collect
experience of that kind faster than she
can catalogue it

  perhaps she doesnt want to do
either

  referring further to my fellow man
i beg to say that her wishes cut very
little ice she will get the experience
whether she wants it or not

  accurate observer are you trying
to flatter me 

  as how 

  do you think me pretty

 even in the darkness-

  be serious do you

  why of course i do i never saw
a prettier girl in my life

  cross your heart

  honest injun-wish i may die
oh well said clyde thats some-
thing thats satisfactory im glad
to extract something o a comolimen-
tary nature at last you were far bet-
ter when i met you at the wades you
did pay me a compliment and you
asked me for a rose please sir do you
precious water
          ft



remember asking a poor girl for a
rose 

  i have it still

  truly a little throb of pleasure
shot through her and crept into her
voice and you never told me

  i was to keep it as security that
was the bargain

  but how much nicer it would be to
say that you kept it because i gave it to
you are you aware that i made an
exception in your favor by doing so
i thought so at the time said
casey  expected a refusal how-
ever i took a chance

  and won are you sure that you
have the rose still and where among
your treasures do you keep it 

  he hesitated

  you dont know where it is thats
just like a man for shame

  youre wrong casey said quietly
i keep it with some little things that
belonged to my mother

  she put out her hand impulsively
oh she exclaimed i-i beg your
pardon

  his strong fingers closed on hers
she did not withdraw her hand he
leaned forward to look into her up-
raised eyes in the growing darkness

  that seemed the proper place to
keep it i value your friendship very
much-too much to presume on it we
are at opposite ends of the world-im
quite aware of that when this little
holiday of yours is over youll go back
to your everyday life and surroundings
and i dont want you to take with you
one regret or unpleasant memory

  i dont know what i shall take she
replied gravely but im not at all
sure that i shall go back

  i dont understand

  suppose she said suppose that
you were a moderately rich man in
good health young without business or
profession without any special talent
and that your friends-your social cir-
cle-were very much like yourself
suppose that your life was spent in
clubs country houses travel-that you
had nothing on earth to do but amuse
yourself nothing to look forward to

but repetitions of the same amusement
what wrould become of you

  to be perfectly truthful he re-
plied i should probably go to the
devil

  the correct answer said clyde
gravely i am going to the devil oh
im strictly conventional i mean that
im stagnating utterly-mentally mor-
ally and physically im degenerating
my life is a feminine replica of the one
i suggested to you im wearied to
death of it-of killing time aimlessly
of playing at literature at charity at
uplifting people who dont want to be
uplifted and theres nothing differ-
ent ahead must i play at living until
i die

  but you will marry he predicted
you will meet the right man that
will make a difference

  perhaps i have met him

  then i wish you great happiness
and perhaps he doesnt care for me
-in that way

  the right man would youre not
hard to fall in love with clyde

  am i not-casey  she smiled up
at him through the lark a little tremor
in her voice she felt his fingers
tighten on hers like bands of steel
crushing them together and she was
conscious of a strange joy in the pain
of it

  you know you are not he said

tensely i could- he broke off

abruptly

  then why dont you  she mur-
mured softly

  why not he exclaimed id look
pretty wouldnt i a busted land specu-
lator falling in love with you ive
some sense of the fitness of things but
when you look at me like that--

  he stooped swiftly and kissed her
drawing her to him almost fiercely oh
girl he said why did you tempt me
ive forgotten what wras due you as my
guest ive forgotten all that ive been
remembering so carefully for weeks
now its over some day the right man
will tell you how he loves you

  i am waiting she whispered for
the right man to tell me now 


the popular magazine

  what he exclaimed incredulously

you dont mean-

  but i do mean she replied oh
casey boy didnt you know  couldnt
you guess  must i do all the love-mak-
ing myself 

  the answer to this question was in
the nature of an unqualified negative
and extended over half an hour but
casey retained many of his scruples
he could not he insisted live on her
money if he went broke as seemed
likely he must have time to get a fresh
stake clyde waived this point having
some faith in jim hess of this how-
ever she said nothing to him

  we had better go she said at last
it is quite dark kitty will wonder
where we are

  shall you tell her better

  not to-night anyway she-you
see-

  shed jolly you you mean of
course but we may as well have it
over

  not to-night clyde repeated she
was uncomfortably conscious of her
confidences to kitty wade made with-
out much thought

  they approached the house from the
rear passing by the kitchen whence
issued the sound of voices

  lets take a peep at fengs com-
pany  casey suggested

  the kitchen was built apart from the
house but attached to it by a covered
way standing in the outer darkness
they could look in through the open
window without risk of being seen and
were close enough to overhear every
word

  feng was resting from the labors of
the day sitting smoking on the kitchen
table facing him a pipe between his
wrinkled lips sat old simon his face
was expressionless but hisayes black
watchful were curiously alert

  what foh you come injun feng
demanded wantee glub injun all
time hiyu eat all same hobo tlamp
spose you hungly me catch some
muckamuck catch piecee blead catcli
col loast beef-loast moosmoos

  simon grunted gutturally ya-as
he drawled	

  hiyu lich gal feng proceeded -

  hush clyde whispered as casey
would have put an end to this risky
eavesdropping i didnt think that
feng had such good taste im getting
compliments from everybody to-night
im really flattered i want to hear
some more

sively

  but i want to

 ya-as simon drawled again
hyas kloshe tenas klootchman-ah-ha

plied making a manful attempt at
clydes surname which was quite be-
yond his lingual attainments

  the prophets last words blurred in
clydes ringing ears the friendly
darkness hid her flaming cheeks why
oh why had she listened  she was not
even shocked by caseys muttered
curse she felt his hand on her arm
drawing her gently back into the deeper
shadows in silence she followed
precious water



  ill fire that infernal yellow scoun-
drel to-morrow he growled

  no no it was my own fault she
declared absolutely and entirely my

own i-i- oh dont look at me

pfcase

  i wont he promised but his voice
shook slightly

  youre laughing she accused him
tragically

  indeed im not he denied but with
the words came an involuntary sound
strongly resembling a chuckle

  shame she cried

  yes yes he gasped i know it
its too bad ha-ha  i really beg your
pardon i- oh good lord

  but clyde gathered up her skirts and
fled whirling up the veranda steps and
into the house like a small cyclone
never pausing until a locked door lay
between her and a ribald unfeeling
world

chapter xxiv

  it was after midnight when clyde
awoke she passed from slumber to
wakefulness instantly without the usual
intervening stages of drowsiness

  outside a gale was blowing and vol-
leys of rain pattered like spent shot on
windows and roof thunder rumbled
ceaselessly a vivid flash rent the outer
darkness illuminating the room and
the succeeding crack shook the house
it was a storm rare in the dry belt of
which there were not more than one or
two in the year for caseys sake she
hoped that there would be no hail with
it better continued drought than a
ruinous bombardment of frozen pellets
from the heavens which would beat the
crops to the ground utterly destroying
them

  as she lay listening she seemed to
hear sounds not of the storm as of
some one moving on the veranda then
came a loud insistent knocking she
heard the door of wades room open
and a long crack of light beneath her
own showed that he had lit a lamp

  hello whos there he asked

  the reply was indistinguishable a
violent blow on the door followed it

  b

she sprang out of bed threw on a
dressing gown thrust her feet into slip-
pers opened her door and peered out

  a single hand lamp on the table
showted wade clad in pajamas and slip-
pers standing before the door his at-
titude expressed uncertainty he
glanced back and saw clyde

  what is it she asked who is
there 

  i dont know he replied there
are men out there they want me to
open the door do you know where

theres a gun handy  i havent-

  the impact of a heavy body cut him
short the lock gave way and the door
swung inward wade sprang back and
caught up a chair framed in the door
silhouetted against the outer blackness
appeared a man his hat was pulled
low over his eyes a handkerchief cut
with eyeholes concealed his face his
right hand held a six-shooter with
which he covered wade back of him
pressing forward were other armed
men

  put that chair dowrn he ordered
nobodys goin to hurt you

  glad to hear it snapped wade
who was the fortunate owner of un-
limited sand what do you mean by
breaking into a house in the middle of
the night and frightening women if
you want money ive got about fifty
dollars and thats all youre welcome
to it if youll clear out

   keep it the intruder returned con-
temptuously fie stepped into the room
followed by four others i guess your
name is wade we dont want you
we want mchale

   well i havent got him said wade
   where is he

  what do you want with him 
  thats none of your business

   all right if thats so its none of
my business where he is

   youd better make it your business
said the other suggestively

  well i wont wade retorted he
isnt here and thatll have to do you
on general principles it dont do to
believe a lawyer wheres dunne 
he isnt here either

  i reckon well make sure of that


the popular magazine

he took a step in the direction of
clydes room wade stepped in front
of him

  no you dont my friend said he
that room belongs to a lady you
keep out of it

  the leader stopped well he said
i dont want to scare no women but
all the same im goin to see the inside
of every room in this house spose
you knock and tell that lady to fix her-
self up sos she wont mind my takin
a look in im goin to make mighty
sure her name aint mchale

  clyde opened the door and walked
into the room she was surprised to
find that she was not in the least fright-
ened said she

  good evening gentlemen do you
think i resemble mr mchale

  no maam said the leader i
dont reckon you favor him much
admiration was apparent in his voice
clyde smiled at him

  then perhaps youll take a look at
my room now and allow me to retire
again

  i dont need to look there maam
the man replied im awful sorry we
troubled you

  thats the way to talk said a quiet
voice from the door

  the leader whirled instantly to look
into the ominous muzzle of a heavy au-
tomatic held by casey dunne

  put that gun down and your hands
up snapped casey quick no non-
sense  ill kill the first man that tries
anything

  the quiet had gone from his voice
it bit like acid strange hard lights
danced in his eyes the hand that held
the gun had not a tremor clyde look-
ing at him saw and recognized in his
face the cold deadliness which she had
once seen in mchales

  without an instants hesitation the
leader put his weapon on the table
you win once he observed

  thats sensible casey commented
now perhaps youll tell me what this
means 

  no objection in the world the
other replied coolly we wanted to
interview mchale

  is that so well tom isnt here to-
night mr dade by the way unless
you really like it you neednt wear that
transformation scheme across your
face same remark applies to the other
gentlemen i like to know my visitors
dade laughed removing the handker-
chief take a good look you may
see me again

  any time you like mr dade and
what did you want with mchale
well dade answered calmly we
figured that hed help us take the stretch
out of a new rope

  nobody else would do queried
casey

  we wanted him

  i see and had our mutual friend
mr cross anything to do with your de-
sire by the way how is mr cross
or should i say the late mr cross
not yet dade replied hes got a
chance

  then arent you too previous
mchale laid for him and plugged
him as he came out of shillers dade
declared

  cross came out of shillers with his
gun in his hand to get mchale said
casey mchale was entitled to shoot
it was an even break

  thats not how i heard it

  thats what mchale says and it
goes with me

  it dont go with me dade declared
me and cross is partners-has been
for years im out to get mchale and
you can send him word i reckon he
aint here or hed be obvious

  hed be mighty obvious casey
agreed i may as well tell you mr
dade that this feud business makes me
tired its sinful and worse than that
its out of date you take notice now
that we wont stand for it youve
pretty well played your string out here
anyway

  dade stared at him i reckon youll
have to talk a little plainer dunne
isnt that plain enough this shoot-
ing was square you let it go as it lies
otherwise well clean up your whole
bunch

  dade laughed thats sure plain
he admitted i like ngrve and youve
precious water



got it a-plenty but you aint got me buf-
faloed at all you heard what i said
it goes

  suit yourself said casey ill
send mchale word anything else i
can do for you to-night

  not a thing dade replied well
be going-unless you want us to stay
im sorry we disturbed the lady but i-
sure thought mchale wras in here
shell forgive you said casey
that part of its all right better think
over what i said i mean it

  so do i said dade grimly you
can send mchale word

  as casey closed the door and set a
chairagainst it in place of the damaged
fastenings kitty wade peeped from
her room

are the outlaws g-gone she asked
they have went her husband re-
plied you are saved mdear your
little heart may now palpitate in normal
palps

  his wife looking altogether charm-
ing and girlish emerged

  well i was frightened she ad-
mitted id give worlds to be as brave
as clyde

  clyde feeling caseys eyes upon her
flushed and gathered her dressing gown
closer conscious for the first time of
her attire oh nonsense kitty she
responded i was really shaking in my
shoes

  you didnt show it casey com-
mented there isnt one girl in a
thousand who would have been as cool
i agree with you said wade he
put his arm around his wife better
go back to roost little girl

  not until i hear all about it said
kitty go and get a bath robe or
something like a good boy pajamas
are very becoming and all the best peo-
ple wear em but-

  i beg everybodys pardon wade
exclaimed in confusion i thought i
had on my-er-that is it never struck
me that i wasnt clad in orthodox gar-
ments he was back in a moment
swathed in a bath robe now casey
tell us how you happened to make that
stage entrance

  not much to tell about it casey re-

                                        v

plied i had an old indian bedded
down in the hay in the stable and be
saw or heard this outfit riding in and
woke me up as a matter of fact the
old boy was just outside with a shot-
gun all the time we had that much
moral support he came to tell me that
this outfit meant to get tom

  this mchale business is serious
said wade

  very serious i dont mean so far
as tom is concerned he can take care
of himself but you can see that we
cant allow these men to bulldoze us
its mchale now to-morrow it may
be some one else

  yes i see but what can you do

about it  the law-

  its outside the law said casey
the law is too slow well make our
own law hello whats that 

  he jumped to his feet gun in hand
as the chair set against the door scraped
back from it out of the darkness stag-
gered sheila mccrae

  water dripped from her old pony hat
and ran in little rivulets from a long
yellow slicker from head to foot she
was spattered with mud her face was
pale drawn and dirt-smeared and
blood oozed slowly from a jagged cut
above her left eye she swayed from
side to side as she walked

  kitty wade cried out clyde rose
swiftly in quick sympathy but casey
was before her

  sheila-girl-whats the matter
he exclaimed

  she stretched out her arms to him
gropingly

  wheres tom casey theyre after
him maybe theyre after you fa-
thers hurt sandy- i cant talk

casey i guess-im-all in

  he caught her as she fell forward
lifting her in his arms as easily as if
she had been a child and laid her on a
couch

  no no he said as clyde would
have put cushions beneath her head
let her lie flat he unbuttoned the
slicker and opened her dress halfway
from throat to waist stripping it away
with ruthless hand a bared shoulder
and arm showed bruised and discolored


the popular magazine

shes been in some mix-up-had a fall
or something wade get me some
whisky and water his long fingers
closed on her wrist shell be all right
in five minutes unless somethings
broken mrs wade get in here and
loosen her corsets give her a chance
kitty stooped obediently and
straightened up in amazement why
-she--

  well how did i know snapped
casey he ran his hand down her side
no ribs broken arms all right good
sheilas long lashes fluttered against
her cheeks she sighed and opened her
eyes

  casey she said never mind me
look out for yourself wheres tom
there are men coming to-night i was

afraid-

  all right sheila he interrupted
tom is safe the men have gone no
trouble at all just lie quiet till things
steady a little have a drink of this
clyde brought water sponge and
towels she cleansed sheilas face and
hands and deftly dressed the cut in her
forehead

  you make me feel like a baby said
sheila i never fainted before in my
life i didnt think i could faint im
all right now may i sit up please
you may lie up if you like casey
replied let me put some pillows un-
der you youve had a bad shake-up
old girl

  beaver boy fell she explained
and threw me i must have struck my
head i dont know how i caught him
again i dont remember very clearly
i had to hang onto the horn sometimes
-dizzy you know i never had to pull
leather before he was afraid of the
lightning and i wasnt strong enough to
handle him afterward the fall took it
out of me i just had to let him go he
knew it and acted mean- ill show him
whose horse he is next time

  you rode on your nerve said
casey tell us all about it tell us
about your father and sandy you were
going to say something when you
keeled over

  the girls keen face clouded oh
heavens casey my head cant be right

yet id clean forgotten my own peo-
ple theres been nothing but trouble
in bunches all day the drivers ran
away this morning smashed the rig
threw father out and broke his leg
this afternoon this man glass whom
we all took for a harmless nuisance ar-
rested sandy

  what casey exclaimed

  yes he did glass is a railway de-
tective he worked quietly nosing
around the ranches talking to every-
body while the other detective attracted
all the attention nobody suspected
glass who would anyway he and
another man arrested sandy for blow-
ing up the dam

  casey whistled softly casting a side
glance at wade

 wheres sandy now where did
they take him 

  sheila laughed but there was little
mirth in it

  they didnt take him anywhere but
i dont know w-here he is i saav him
with the two men down by the stable
i thought they were talking about land
half an hour afterward he came to the
house with his parfieches and asked me
to put hirn up a couple of weeks grub-
stake he had the men locked up in the
harness room but he didnt tell me how
he had done it he took his pack horse
and his blankets and hunting outfit and
pulled out i didnt know what to do
i didnt tell the folks the ranch hands
know but they wont let the men out
and then it must have been after ten
oclock when one of our men told me of
the shooting he had heard it from
somebody on the road he said that
cross friends were talking of lynching
mchale and perhaps you i didnt be-
lieve it at first but after a while i got
nervous everybody was asleep and
anyway there was nobody i could ask
to go so i came myself

  and tom and i will never forget
it sheila said casey i dont know
another girl who could have made it
after a fall like that in this storm

  it was perfectly splendid of you
cried kitty wade with hearty admira-
tion

  clyde obeying a sudden impulse
precious wfitetr



leaned forward and kissed the bruised
forehead sheila was unused to such
endearments she had no intimates of
her own sex with the women she was
courteously distant repelling and rather
despising them she had felt clydes
instinctive hostility and had returned it
surprised and touched by her actions
the tears started to her eyes clyde put
her arms around the slender pliant
waist

  come with me dear and get some
sleep youre badly shaken up well
sleep in in the morning

  but i have to go back sheila ob-
jected nobody knows ive gone i
have to be back by morning and then
theres beaver boy my heavens i
left him standing outside oh ive got

  casey gently pressed her back as she
would have risen

  ill stable the horse old girl and ill
be at talapus by daylight to tell them
where you are dont you worry now
about anything-not even sandy if
hes gone back to the hills ill bet he
finds tom theyll be all right

  do you think so casey and will
you do that much for me im awfully
sore and tired every bone and muscle
of me aches

  you poor little girl he raised her
in his arms come on girls and put
her to bed ill carry her in

chapter xxv

  with the first streaks of dawn casey
and simon mounted and rode for tala-
pus but before they had ridden five
hundred yardscasey discovered an ex-
traordinary thing in his ears sounded
a sustained musical murmur nothing
less than the happy laugh of running
water

  by the lord harry he ejaculated
theres water in the ditches

  simon nodded ya-as hiyu chuck
stop all same skookttm chuck he ob-
served signifying that there was a full
head of it like a rapid

  the ditches were running to the brim
after the soaking rain of the night the

water was not immediately needed but
it showed that the irrigation companys
works no longer controlled the supply
when they reached the river they found
a swirling yellow torrent running
yeasty-topped speckled with debris

  spose cloud k ok shut simon ob-
served

  cloudburst eh said casey looks
like it then either the companys dam
has gone or it cant take care of the
head

  the former supposition seemed the
more likely somewhere up in the heart
of the hills the black storm cloud had
broken and its contents collected by
nameless creeks and gulches had
swooped down on the coldstream rais-
ing it bank high booming down to the
lower reaches practically a wall of
water against which only the strongest
structures might stand temporary
ones would go out before it washed
away like a childs sand castle in a
fundy tide

  ignoring trails they struck straight
across country the land had b 
washed clean beneath the brown
grasses the earth lay dark and moist a
hundred fresh elusive odors struck le
nostjrils called forth from the soil 
the rare moisture a silent token of a
latent fertility on the way there 

 houses  fences no cleared fields
the land lay in the dawn as empty as
when the keels of restless white nuri
first split the western ocean and mre
lifeless for the great buffalo herds n
of old gave the men of the plains an 
foothills food and raiment were gone
forever

  the sun was up when they reached
talapus mrs mccrae had just dis-
covered her daughters absence and her
husband was cursing the leg that held
him helpless casey told them the events
of the night and donald mccrae was
proud of his daughter and but little
worried about his sou

  show me another girl would have
ridden in that storm he exclaimed
shes the old stock-the old frontier
stock arid sandy locking the detec-
tive in the harness room ide chuckled
go down and let them out casey and


thb populacr maqazinb

give them breakfast a fine pair of
children weve got mother

  sandy can take care of himself
said mrs mccrae practically he al-
ways did since he could walk and he
took his own ways asking nobody and
sheila for a girl is the same they
take after you donald not me but
now casey mrs wade is at chakchak
isnt she

 mrs wade and miss burnaby
casey replied its all right mrs mc-
crae

  sheila needs no chaperon said her
father

  not with casey said her mother
but theres the gossip donald and the
dirty tongues its not like the old
days

  true enough maybe mccrae ad-
mitted and he added when his wife
had left the room what have they got
hold of to arrest the boy casey

  i dont know casey replied but
well face the music donald

  when casey entered the  harness
room glass and another man a stran-
ger lay in one corner on a heap of
sacks sandy had done a most work-
manlike job and he had put a neat
finish to it by strapping each man to a
stanchion with a pair of driving reins

  good morning gentlemen said
casey

  is it said glass sourly his old
hesitating manner had quite vanished

  beautiful casey replied sun
shining birds singing crops growing
gods in his heaven alls well with the
world like to take a look at it or
are you too much attached to your pres-
ent surroundings

  you can cut out the funny stuff
said glass i dont ever laugh before
breakfast

  quite right too casey replied
just roll over a little till i get at those
knots there you are mr glass now
your friend here dont think i know
him

  jack pugh sheriffs officer said
glass rising stiffly with considerable
difficulty

  ill have him in shape to shake hands
in a minute said casey as he worried

at the knots and so mr glass in-
stead of an innocent landlooker you are
a real live mysterious detective you
dont look the part or perhaps you are
still disguised

  i can stand a josh better now said
glass maybe im not such a live
proposition as i might be when two
grown men let a kid hogtie them it sort
of starts them thinking

  it sure does pugh agreed he was
a saturnine gentleman with a humorous
eye i been wantin to scratch my nose
for eight solid hours he affirmed ir-
relevantly rubbing that organ violently
with his free hand

  pies some kid said glass where
is he

  i havent seen him he left word
where to find you

  beat it somewhere i suppose
glass commented he fooled us up in
great style ill say that much at first
he acted about the way youd expect a
country kid to act-scared to death pie
wanted to change his overalls for pants
before we took him anywhere said
they were hanging up in here we fell
for it we came in and there was a
pair of pants hanging on a nail he
walked over to them and the next thing
we knew he had a gun on us i hope i
know when a man means business-and
he did he had half a notion to shoot
anyway

  thats right pugh confirmed
hes one of them kids that makes gun-
men no bluff i know the kind
so when he told me to tie pugh i
did it glass continued then he
dropped a loop over me and thats all
there is to tell the jokes on us just
now

  so it is said casey whatever
made you think that kid had anything to
do with blowing up the dam 

  hadnt he

  casey smiled genially why how
should i know mr glass i was just
asking what you were going on

  im not showing my hand i dont
say the kid did it alone

  and so you thought youd round
him up and sweat some information out
of him that was it wasnt it
precious water



  youre quite a guesser and you show
a whole lot of interest in the answer
retorted glass keep on guessing

  i dont need to come up to the
house and have breakfast and for
heavens sake dont say anything to
frighten the kids mother

  what do you take us for said
glass well treat the whole thing as a
joke-to her

  casey breakfasted with them and
after they had gone sought simon the
old indian full to repletion was squat-
ting on the kitchen steps smoking and
blinking sleepily

  no see um sandy he observed
where him stop

  no more sandy stop this illahee
casey replied sandy klatawa kopa
stone illahee all same tom meaning
that sandy had gone in the direction of
the hills as had mchale

  why him klatazva simon asked
casey explained and simon listened
gravely his receptiveness was enor-
mous information dropped into him
as into a bottomless pit vanishing with-
out splash

  sandy hyas young fool he com-
mented me tell him mamook huyhny
moccasin spose moccasin stop ikt
man findum then heltopay polisman
mamook catchum put um in skookum
house maybeso hang um kopa neck
what are you talking about any-
way  casey demanded and simon
told him of the track of the patched
moccasin and of his warning to sandy

  casey immediately fitted things to-
gether lie knew that sandys right
moccasin was almost invariably worn
through at the toe before the left he
had seen him patching them and be-
cause they wore through at the same
place the patches were of nearly the
same shape so that if glass had found
a patched moccasin it was not necessar-
ily the one which had made the track
put that would make little difference
either farwell or his assistant must
have told glass about this track if he
had found a pair of sandys moccasins
to correspond with the footprint he had
come very near getting sandy with the
goods iut farwell or somebody must

have directed glass suspicions to
sandy

  however that was sandy had made
a clean get-away into a region where he
would be hard to catch he wras fa-
miliar with the trails the passes the lit-
tle basins and pockets nestling in the
hills he was well provisioned and well
armed and the last caused casey some
uneasiness for having once resisted ar-
rest sandy would be very apt to do so
again

  simon he said i want you to take
papah letter to tom

 where tom stop simon asked
naturally enough

plied maybe not you try sunk

  simon looked grieved and pained

touching appeal to friendship ill re-
member that if i ever work for you

ing and your cayuses rustle for them-
selves

  and simon accepted this ultimatum
with resignation

	all right said he you my tilli-
kum tom my tillikum spose you
catch hiyu grubstake

  having arranged for a message to
mchale it occurred to casey that he
should see whether the sudden rise of
the river had swept the companys tern-


the popular magazine

porary dam accordingly he rode
thither

  the storm had entirely passed and
the sun shone brightly great white
billowy fair-weather clouds rolled up
in open order before the fresh west
wind and the shadows of them trailed
across the face of the earth moving
swiftly sharply defined sweeping
patches of shade against the green and
gold of a clean-washed sunny summer
world off to the westward where the
ranges thrust gaunt gray peaks against
the sky line the light shimmered
against patches of white the remnants
of the last winters snows far away
just to be discerned through a notch in
the first range was a vivid point of
emerald or jade the living green of a
glacier

  it was a day when it was good to be
alive and casey dunne hard clean in
the full power of his manhood the
fresh west wind in his face and a
strong willing horse beneath him re-
joiced in it

  as he rode his thoughts reverted to
clyde burnaby indeed she had never
since the preceding night been entirely
absent from them but because his
training had been to do one thing at a
time and think of what he was doing
to the exclusion of all else he had un-
consciously pigeonholed her in the back
of bis mind now she emerged

  shiner mson he apostrophized
his horse if things break right youre
going to have a missus what dye
think of that hey you yellow-hided old
scoundrel and by the great tyee
youll eat apples and sugar out of her
hand and if you so much as lay back
your ears at her ill flail your sinful
heart out with a neck yoke dye get
that you buzzard-head

  shiner in full stride made a swift
grab for his riders left leg and his
rider with equal swiftness kicked him
joyously in the nose

  you would hey nice congratula-
tions you old man-eater ill make a
ladys horse of you if you dont behave
i sure will and well build a decent
house and break two thousand acres
and keep every foot of it as fine and

clean as a seed bed and have it all un-
der ditch the show place of the whole
dry belt you bet we will we wont
sell an acre fancy prices wont tempt
us well keep the whole shootin
match till we cash in his mood
changed

  cash in its funny to think of
that old horse isnt it and yet ten
years from now youll be no good and
thirty years from now ill be near the
end of the deal and clyde why
shiner we cant think of her as an old
lady can we with her smooth cheeks
a little withered and the suppleness
gone from her body and her eyes dim
and her glorious hair white lord
horse we mustnt think of it shell
always be the same dear clyde to us
wont she sufficient unto the day
my equine trial and friend others will
come after us and there will be evil-
tempered buckskins loping this foothill
country and maybe a casey dunne curs-
ing them when you and i are ranging
the happy hunting grounds

  out of the sunlit distances a horse
and rider appeared rapidly approach-
ing it was farwell and recognizing
dunne he pulled up

  in case you dont know it he said
without preliminary or greeting ill
tell you that our dam went out with the
flood you didnt need to use dynamite
this time

  providence casey suggested
farwells comment consisted of but
one word which unless by contrast is
not usually associated with providential
happenings

  call it that if you like he growled
well get the men responsible for it
one of these days

  you made a beginning with young
mccrae casey reminded him

  i dont know what you mean
dont you know that glass tried to
arrest him

  what cried farwell

  his surprise was too genuine to be
feigned thereupon casey told him
what had occurred in the last few hours
both at talapus anil chakchak

  farwell listened biting his lips and
precious water



frowning and his first words were an
inquiry as to sheila

  miss mccrae rode through that
storm last night he exclaimed good
lord is she badly hurt 

  only shaken up i think

  thank god for that said farwell
with evident sincerity he hesitated
for a moment see here dunne do
you mind if i ask you an impertinent
question 

  fire away

  are you going to marry her
certainly not what put that no-
tion in your head

  it got there you were pretty thick
and if she rode there in that storm-

unless she thought a lot of you-

  im mighty proud of it were good
friends-like brother and sister no
more she has the best brand of clean-
strain pluck of any girl i know

  so she has farwell agreed shes

a girl in a million shes- he

stopped reddening

  by george farwell said casey
is it that way with you

  she doesnt care a tinkers dam for
me said farwell bluntly thats not
saying what i think of her im no
ladies man-dont pretend to be let
that go i suppose ill be blamed for
young mccraes arrest well i didnt
know a thing about it ivetried to
give the family a good deal-better
than the rest of you anyway i dont
like the boy and he doesnt like me
pulled a gun on me once-well never
mind that here youve been straight
with me and ill tell you when the
dam was blown up we found the track
of a patched moccasin in soft earth
keeler took an impression of it or
made a cast or something-i dont
know just what but i do know that he
photographed it since then ive no-
ticed young mccraes foot and i be-
lieve he made the track though it didnt
strike me at the time that was about
the only clew we found mind you

dunne i believe you were in it your-
self but i havent a thing to go on if
glass has found a patched moccasin of
mccraes hes pretty near got him to
rights i dont know what hes got
though about cross and mchale i
dont care a curse which shot the other
these men-cross dade lewis and
some more-were protecting our prop-
erty and thats all

  not quite all they blew up our
dams

  just as man to man said farwell
let me ask you if you expected to run
a dynamite monopoly

  im not kicking said casey im
merely stating facts i can take my
medicine

  youre a good deal of a man far-
well acknowledged grudgingly i hate
a squealer anyway it was no part of
their job to break into your house see
here dunne the last five minutes has
got us better acquainted than the last
two months ill fire these fellows to-
morrow if youll promise me that our
ditches wont be interfered with again
as long as we have water there will
be no trouble said casey ill prom-
ise nothing more

  thats good for some weeks any-
way farwell predicted i guess
well have to fight it out in the end
still im glad to have had this talk i
like you better than i did and i can
tell you there was lots of room for it-
is yet for that matter good-by
without waiting for a reply he dug
a heel into his horse and swept on
casey watched him go with a thought-
ful smile

  odd devil he muttered queer
combination i dont like him but--
well hes a fighter and i believe hes
straight to think of him being fond
of sheila i wonder if he has a chance
there she never mentions him now
hm finding no answer to the ques-
tion he wheeled shiner and headed for
home

the sand of mr- fitzmaurice

by george van schaick

    la which you will hear of a certain polite gentleman who wasshang
    haied and who took an original method to browbeat his captors
    mi fitzmaurice didnt object to the work on board ship-he felt that
    the exercise would do him good - but to one of his habit of mind
    the surroundings lacked refinement and naturally became obnoxious

the death of captain smith at
sea might have been hailed with
joy by his crew had they not
been aware that they were fall-
ing from the frying pan into the
fire pedro gomez his first mate six
feet high and very broad assumed
command and enforced his orders with
iron fists and yankee sea talk combin-
ing a slight portuguese accent with
faintly negroid inflections

  within a month he lost a lot of top-
hamper in a frightful blow and later
on coming across a nice pod of whales
had two boats stove into matchwood
and thereafter fed in idleness three
wounded men two others had lost
the number of their mess and the
sharks had presumably taken care of
them

  landing at vau-vau he suffered the
penalty of ill repute kanaka whalers
fought shy of his ship the natives
smiled sweetly piled coconuts and
oranges and bananas on his deck and
always came in sufficient numbers to
make kidnaping unsafe

  remembering the doctrine of half a
loaf and being painfully short-handed
he chanced to meet ashore a slim in-
dividual who called himself mr court-
ney fitzmaurice who wa beach comb-
ing clad in picturesque rags some
square gin and a polite invitation
fetched this gentleman aboard in a
rather sleepy condition and when he
awoke in the focsle and strolled out on
deck required knocking down but two
or three times before he appeared rec-
onciled to his fate

  when they struck fish he managed
to avoid catching a crab and didnt act
as if he were scared to death with
becoming resignation he turned for
hours the wheel handle of the mincing
machine and below decks awed the
other hands by the choiceness of his
language

  my dear william he told one of
them as the two were picking tarred
rope into oakum i have no occasion
for repining save the natural reluctance
of a gentleman to obey the discourteous
behests of a colored person my lungs
once considered as slightly impaired
may benefit from a short stay at sea
and the unwonted exercise may be good
for me in fact i am becoming quite
muscular

  he lifted an arm about as thick as a
broom handle flexed it until his biceps
rose to the size of a cape cod oyster
and looked at the horizon with the ap-
preciation of a nature lover whereat
squinty bill stared at him and snorted
mildly

  i calls him a armless idjit he con-
fided that afternoon to a friend who
shared with him the accommodation of
the crows nest at a dizzy height up the
mainmast head asked me if there
wuz a chanst for a toothbrush from the
slop chest he did an started explainin
about takin the sun with the hog yoke
till me head wuz a flurryin says to-
bacco makes him sick he does hes
fitten for a sailorman bout as much as
a schoolmarm

  hes got a keen eye all right re-
plied the other who suddenly stared
the sjnd of mr fitzmaurice



hard and with a voice like a foghorn
bawled out a-a-a-a-a-h thar she
blo-o-o-ows whereupon captain go-
mez yelled aloft for the direction
shrieked to the men to lay down
howled for boats to get ready and
sprang up the ratlines with amazing
agility

  it was a hundred-barrel bull and gave
them a long fight yet they finally got
him alongside after using two bomb
lances and three boats supplies of line
with all the drags they could fasten on

  gomez was pleased it was the first
bit of fishing under his command that
had resulted in no loss after the last
tun of oil was stowed below and the
men could again breathe without gasp-
ing mr fitzmaurice strolled aft to the
unspeakable amazement of the skipper
and  bunch of mates and harpooneers
when he failed to stop at the water butt
for a drink the only possible excuse
for a foremast hands coming aft there
was an instant of expectant silence
during which owing to unusual good
humor the captain forbore to knock
him down finally with language pic-
turesquely adorned he was ordered
back

  fitzmaurice stood still with a bland
and gentle expression

  but you havent heard what i was
going to say he finally ventured id
like to go back to vau-vau now my
hands are all blistered i dont want
to hurt your feelings but to one of my
habit of mind the surroundings lack re-
finement and i may say are becoming
obnoxious besides i have no other
pants they refuse to give me any from
the slop chest and i really abominate
trousers soaked in oil

  gomez gasped strode up and tow-
ered for a moment over the little chap
grasping him by his shirt collar and
the seat of the garment mentioned he
swung him and sent him sprawling on
the deck many feet away the man
picked himself up and investigated his
wardrobe

 and now youve gone and torn
them still more he said i warn you
that i shall not stay with you any
longer

  belay your jaw tackle howled the
skipper

  mr fitzmaurice walked away and
joined his watch in the focsle where
he was received with the respect his
gall as they termed it fully deserved

  late that night as the captain strolled
on deck while smoking an exceedingly
rank manila he dimly saw a swiftly
creeping form in the dark but con-
cluded that it was the ships cat in the
morning finding that breakfast had
been due for fifteen minutes he
searched out the steward and threatened
him with prolonged agony

  please capn the mans voice qua-
vered some un done stole my clock

  who stole your clock  thundered
the skipper

  dunno sah bran new one as cost
me a dollar in nbedford i woun it
las night an put it to ship time but it
didnt never woke me up count o bein
gone

  captain gomez swore profusely
promised a thorough search and con-
dign punishment to somebody and
called syme the second mate

  mr syme he ordered take the
key and open the powder box and bring
the keg here we got to load some
more bomb lances

  in a minute the second returned
rather haggard of face and cast a
startled glance around the skippers
cabin

  well whats bitin you asked
gomez and where the devil is that
keg

  sure you didnt take it out yourself
and forget about it asked syme

  the answering roar would have done
credit to a bull an empty bottle whizzed
by the seconds head as gomez leaped
from his stool and started after syme
who just managed to keep out of reach
as he flew up the companionway but
once on deck discipline and manners
of a sort had to prevail and gomez
gritted his teeth as he hurried to the box
on deck well forward of the try works
where the powder was kept

  what did you leave it open for  he
snarled

  it was open sullenly answered


the popular magazine

syme staples pried out and the pad-
locks lying on that coil of rope

  lay aft all hands roared the skip-
per

  men came running some of them
still pulling on temporarily discarded
garments and captain gomez pointed
to the box

 whos been up to them dogs
tricks  he demanded

   i jpnn

  ill haze the hull bilin of you till
youll all wish you was dead he cried
ill make you know the dogs life you
get ford now and one of you come back
with that keg of powder inside five
minutes or some of yous going to get
killed hold on  wheres that skinny
fool

  he had suddenly noticed the absence
of fitzmaurice and directed two har-
pooners to go forward and bring him-
by the scruff of his neck during the
interval he paced up and down in a
towering rage glaring at the uneasy
men who shifted from one foot to the
other and forgot to chew their quids
yet they were glad of the prospect that
at least one man was likely to bear the
brunt of the skippers fury

  but the harpooners returned an-
nouncing that fitzmaurice was not to
be found

  maybe hes fell overboard sug-
gested one cautiously

  inquiry elicited the fact that no one
had seen the idjit since the first dog-
watch a thorough search was or-
dered but the general opinion was that
the missing man had preferred a dive
overboard to the company of the be-
lugas crew

  n i cant rightly say i blame him
quoth squinty bill as a sort of funeral
oration

  the black cook soon afterward re-
ported to the mate that some one had
rifled the contents of the cupboard in
which canned goods were kept for the
mess aft the first mate himself missed
an ancient huge colt revolver he always
kept fully loaded besides a box of
cartridges the steward tearfully an-
nounced the disappearance of a kero-
sene lamp and a can of astral oil

  its my opinion this bloomin ships
full of bloody burglars asserted syme

  ill make em bloody enough before
im through with em raged gomez
but youre a fool do you reckon
theres a dozen of em theres just
one man done it all that skinny little
idjit an he didnt take all them things
to jump overboard with

  came the third mate an ancient stiff-
jointed mariner taken on board merely
to relieve the chief owner from having
to provide for a poor relation he
spoke tearfully

  whos been riflin my berth  he
whined my lectric battery i uses fer
the rheumatiz is gone i tell you it
aitlt no decent joke an the pains a
cornin on right now

  his tale was received in silence and
the general indignation was mingled
with a feeling of admiration for the un-
known criminal

  why didnt he tuck the bloomin
ship under his arm and walk away with
it asked bull mccarthy the first offi-
cer

  get them lanterns ready we got
to find him ordered gomez gritting
his teeth

  after an unavailing look aloft
the after quarters were thoroughly
searched then they went through the
focsle with a fine-tooth comb the
forward hatch was lifted and amid a
scurrying of rats and overgrown cock-
roaches the spaces between huge tuns
were investigated up again on deck
and the middle hatch came up in a si-
lence only broken by the sound of creak-
ing pulleys

  but he couldnt have lifted them
hatches all by hisself objected the an-
cient third

  that cuss kin do anythin he has a
mind ter asserted syme

  the hunters drew a blank again and
looked at one another like men becom-
ing convinced of the existence of
spooks the chain locker proved bar-
ren and the cook house only revealed
some specially dirty dishcloths which
drew down upon the negros head a
hurricane of indignant language from
the skipper
the sant of mr fitzmaurice



  suddenly the carpenter bethought
himself of the trapdoor in his shop
which led to a part of the hold wherein
were stored barrel hoops lumber for
boat mending and shooks for casks
the officers followed him and chips
pushed away a bunch of shavings from
the floor took hold of an iron ring
and the door came up cautiously ly-
ing on his stomach the carpenter looked
down

  we got- him he exclaimed
theres a light down there some-
where

  gomez pushed him aside and jumped
on the ladder leading below

  i wouldnt come down any farther
came a pleasant voice from somewhere
in the semidarkness youre intrud-
ing on my privacy and besides you
make an awfully good target at any
rate your legs do

  come out of there before i fetch
you snarled the skipper

  you are very very rude returned
the voice i am unwillingly detained
on this greasy ship and wont take or-
ders from you speak politely and get
me ashore and i will show no resent-
ment

  come on cried the skipper to his
men

  i just have to do it aavfully sorry
my dear fellow came the voice accom-
panied by an explosion and a bullet
which plowed away a long strip of skin
from the captains thigh if you come
down any farther ill have to shoot
for keeps i didnt really try to hurt
you that time you know

  gomez hesitated

  if you dont come out of there ill
lower a pan of burning brimstone he
finally yelled ill make you know
what a rat feels like when we smoke
ship

  how unpleasant then ill have to
explode this old keg of powder after all
very good powder i believe i only
have to stick the muzzle of this pistol
in the bunghole and pull the trigger
ive also rigged a very nice arrange-
ment with the ancient invalids battery
so that when im asleep if the door is
opened again without my permission i

will find oblivion in the midst of
dreams by the way next time you
want to speak knock three times on the
door but never come down i dont
object to conversation when carried out
as among gentlemen

  four mates two harpooners and
the carpenter stood around scratching
their heads while gomez holding his
scraped thigh looked at them with the
nearest approach to helplessness ever
seen on his square-jawed face

  lets put down that door and talk
it over he finally said maybe hes
just a lunatic and thems unsafe

  oh captain came the voice again
i was able to bring down quite a stock
of provisions but im rather short of
water

  come out and get it gomez advised
him

  oh dear no dont let me get too
thirsty for fear of accidents i wrill
suggest that if inside of an hour i
dont have five gallons of water a dish-
pan a piece of soap and maybe a
bottle of square gin something may
happen dont forget the three knocks
and dont bother me too soon im ex-
perimenting how to heat a can of corn
with the kerosene lamp its quite ex-
citing with the ship rolling and that
keg of powtder so near

  the carpenter slammed the door
down and the mates instinctively re-
treated farther aft gomez for the
next quarter of an hour filled the am-
bient with lurid language which how-
ever hardly seemed to meet the practi-
cal requirements of the situation

  syme kept looking furtively at his
watch as minutes elapsed in the dis-
cussion of various schemes scoffed at
as soon as they were presented

  times passing he finally ventured
wont it be best to humor that ere
lunatic an let down that water may-
be hes gettin real thirsty

  gomez swore at him but finally told
him to do as he liked what about
gin asked syme he might get
drunk and then maybe wte could get at
him

  oh my lands whimpered the an-
cient third think of a drunk man


the popular magazine

a-tryin to cook over a kerosene lamp
next to a fifty-pound keg o powder
youre plum crazy

  the required supplies were finally
furnished but the amount of gin was
very moderate

  you knocked very well approved
the self-constituted prisoner from a
safe distance i forgot to say that if
you should try to poison me that alarm
clock makes a pretty contrivance by
which that keg will fire itself unless
attended to regularly if you hear me
knocking very hard youd better send
some one to find out what i require
mother used to say i was a very impa-
tient boy

  sytne went back and reported the
conversation his tale was confided
by the carpenter to the steward who
told the cook and presently every man
trod the deck like a chicken on a hot
plate squinty bill told bloodcurdling
stories about lunatics the portuguese
hands sought forgiveness of sins from
each other and captain gomez began
to haze his crew like a slave driver

  some hours elapsed and finally as
bull mccarthy came by the skipper
grabbed- him nearly tearing off the
shirt that hid a mossy chest

  get ready to come about he or-
dered im going back to vau-vau
call all hands and crowd on sail

  he looked fiercely at his mate as if
challenging a laugh but bull remained
as a graven image and gomez sought
his cabin incapacitated by suppressed
rage from attending to the work

  for a few days they bucked head
winds  then followed a slant which gave
them a fair course on the sixth day
they raised a whale not four miles off
the port bow yet gomez furious paid
no attention and drove the beluga on

  meanwhile mr fitzmaurice was
proving a nightmare his wants in-
creased as did the ease with which he
obtained them he actually sent a mes-
sage to the captain to send down a pack
of cards as lie thought that solitaire
might beguile some weary hours with
speechless indignation chips found that
he had bored two auger holes through
the deck for better ventilation he

called for rat traps cheese and poison
because the rodents were becoming too
familiar his dire needs as to more
efficient pantaloons were supplied

  finally land was raised among the
friendly islands and vau-vau was in
sight with bold outlines crowned with
thick woods through easy passes
among the reefs the beluga masterly
handled threaded her way to a bay pro-
tected from all winds and lined with a
glistening white beach native dwell-
ings peeped out of the darker masses of
orange and coconut trees and outriggers
began to flock around the mudhook
splashed down with chain rattling
through hawse holes and the old bark
swung to the tide

  chips hammered three lusty blows on
the trapdoor with the back of an adze

  were there he sang out after he
had duly received the answer

  do you know came the pleasant
voice of mr fitzmaurice that this was
getting rather irksome pray take my
compliments to captain gomez and tell
him i would appreciate a cup of coffee
as the natives must be bringing supplies
on board pray intimate that a couple of
fried eggs with a few thin rashers of
bacon will be welcome i will soon be
ready to leave thank you

   the cook prepared this refection with
a light heart and it was duly lowered
in the bucket which served mr fitz-
maurice as a tray finally the latter
declared that he was ready to leave

  it was useless to expect privacy in
the departure men aloft who were
tying up sail watched agape others
peered from behind whaleboats and
deck houses the after crowd was as-
sembled

  outside the carpenters shop gomez
waited with a goodly crowbar held be-
hind his back

  you will kindly clear out the car-
penters shop directed the beach-
combing dictator im coming and
please do nothing rash because im
very nervous

  he came up the ladder swiftly with
eyes blinking a little from the unaccus-
tomed light he seemed a little stouter
the sand of mr fitzmaurice



suspended before him with strong cord
like the drum of a hindu snake
charmer he bore the heavy keg while
his right hand held the revolver with
its muzzle inserted in the bunghole
to right and left he smiled pleasantly
and the crowbar with loud clatter
dropped from the skippers hands

  i desire to say my friends that the
modus vivendi lately established has not
been without its charms and for such
kindnesses as i have received i de-
sire to thank you no i will not go
down to one of the outriggers for fear
something might accidentally drop on
my head i prefer an escort from the
ship commanded by our gallant cap-
tain

  he strolled to one of the whaleboats
hanging from its davits

  kindly order a boats crew he
directed and then we can lower away
as soon as the captain is ready

  he did not clamber in till crew and
captain were aboard the tortures un-
dergone by the brawny oarsmen in
seeking to hide their grins were pitiful
to behold finally the oars struck the
water and the boat made for the white
beach

  it is queer captain gomez com-
mented mr fitzmaurice what a de-
sire there is to twitch ones finger when
it has been resting long upon a trigger

  the helpless furious unspeakable
language that followed may have been
a relief to the skipper though he dared
not lift a hand but mr fitzmaurice
listened with a pleasant expression

  you must feel better now that you
have that off your mind he said sym-
pathetically

  no answer came and the boat gently
grated on the beach where a dark and
cheerful population was ready to re-
ceive all hands with open arms a word
in their lingo from mr fitzmaurice

caused them to stand aside however
and the two men walked up the beach
in silence

  i still feel the motion of the ship in
my legs finally ventured mr fitz-
maurice this is very delightful and
the climate is ideal sorry you cant
make a long stay may i inquire how
far you are going the best of friends
must part you know and i desire to
thank you for your courteous escort

  i got to have that keg o powder
said gomez sullenly need it for my
bomb lancgs and the darting gun

  dear me how distressing ex-
claimed mr fitzmaurice i fear i
shall put you to great inconvenience
to tell you the truth im awfully timid
about loose powder you know i
would have made a splendid burglar
but the thought of carrying nitro-
glycerin about to blow safes with
makes cold chills run down my back
im afraid i spilled it all out in the sea
for fear of accidents see for your-
self

chapter vi

n the morning the fire had burned
itself out in the greenings down the
valley wreaths of smoke whirled
up from the blackened timbers and
cellars the brick walls of the bank
building a dozen stone fireplace chim-
neys and a dozen charred fragments
of house frames were erect in the deso-
lation there too stood the great oak
tree where the bankers mansion yard
had been the tips of some of  its
branches were scorched some of its
leaves were browned but for the most
part it stood huge and solemn a little
scarred but promising to live long after
the ruins were hidden in wilderness
again

 bolde went to where he had seen
the man on the night before and was
rewarded by the sight of a nail scratch
on a stone-the figure had not been a
figment of his imagination  it had been
a real live man nor was there any
doubt but what he was the same man

who had killed alexander cobvale who
had fled before the detective though
not with fear evidently-a bewhiskered
hermit perhaps insane with years of
brooding he was old-very old ap-
parently-and a maniac very likely

  hes cleaned up cobvale bolde
muttered to himself ties cleaned up
forestport too i wonder what is his
name anyhow 

  he swung the old ledger on his back
with a tackle and strap of vines and
going around the head of the gutted
town he started up the mountainside
beyond it was in that direction the
apparition of the firelight had disap-
peared perhaps he had left some track
there-and he had

  in one of the runways which deer
had followed down to the salt barrels
in the old stores of the town he found
footprints-one set coming and one
going the detective rejoiced to be once
more on the trail as he said to himself
of asix-thousand-dollar man the
trail led up into the ridge backs of the
meanness in the mountains



clinch mountain chain it led over the
divide and along the sidehill it dis-
appeared in laurel thicket and oak sec-
ond growth it was a wild and lonely
country with more deer and turkeys
than men and cattle or hogs down
one slope the detective found a ledge
of red iron ore in another place he
saw gray and beautiful marble crop-
pings he came to tracts of woodland
which were virgin forest growing as
the trees had grown for a thousand
years

  late in the afternoon he found the
old road over the bridge he turned
into it and followed down into the val-
ley beyond he came to a cabin in a
three-acre clearing the cabin was of
logs and around it was a fence built
to keep out the hogs cattle and deer
dogs were in the inclosure and they
bellowed warnings bolde stopped at
the log-block fence steps and whooped
a shaggy man cautiously showed his
face and answered then he came out
gun in hand to talk to the stranger
his expression of doubtful hostility
changed to one of tolerance

  howdy he greeted come in an
set

  bolde followed the man into his sin-
gle-room cabin the dogs sniffing and
the children flocking behind the furni-
ture and under the bed with just their
heads sticking out tousled and staring-
eyed

  did any one pass this way to-day
bolde asked

  no suh there aint ben ary man
oveli that path this mohnin

  bolde knew as much for the tracks
had disappeared from the path i

came across from the railroad-

  you say yo did 

  yes i had to stay in forestport
last night-and it started burning and
burned all up

  lawse that ole town burned i

chapter vii

  bolde traveled on through the coun-
try beyond forestport he had lost
track of the old mans trail and when
he came to the mountain cabins no one
could or would tell him what had be-
come of the old whiskered man who
had murdered alexander cobvale of
course the detective did not ask for the
murderer

  no sooner had he told the people
that cobvale was dead than there were
exclamations and then through the
mountain cabins and down into the
houses in the rich and fertile valleys
swept a wave of joy and exhilaration
from the little mountain cabin where
he first told that cobvale had died suf-
fering the man took him down into
the valley and bolde had to tell and
retell the details of the crime

  the listeners hung eagerly on the
description of the man as he suffered
among the rich fixtures of his office
they gasped and laughed and thanked
god that the man whose wealth was


the popular magazine

founded on their ruin had been shot
in cold blood for they were a simple
people with scant respect for the laws
and courts which are supposed to be
the bulwark of the countrys peace and
liberty

  joe pete arten took bolde from
place to place treating him with utmost
respect but eager to lead the bearer of
good tidings around and when joe
pete had a surfeit si rob cale took
him over the next ridge and introduced
him as the man who could tell how
aleck cobvale had died as the news
had spread on before they found
groups of eager listeners at the store-
houses the mills and the other places
where men gathered there were spe-
cial sessions so to speak-matinees-
at which the womenfolks in their blue
poke bonnets came to listen and bolde
suffered himself to become a show in
order that he might catch a glimpse of
the man whom he had followed so far

  passing himself off as a timber
looker and estimator he stirred no sus-
picion in the breasts of the mountain
people in fact they forgot their natu-
ral fear and reticence in the presence
of a stranger because this stranger had
brought them the good word that a
common enemy had at last been
searched out and punished for the
wrong he had done to the mountain
people

 none remembered bolde he had
gone away as a mere boy and he was
a man now here and there he found
some one who had lived in forestport
and who had gone down in the crash
not only had cobvale taken their
money but he had deprived them of
their ambition and whipped them in
their battle with the world almost be-
fore they had begun it-a sort of great
immoral victory so to speak

  was he rich when he died some-
body asked

  yes very rich-

  an he lived in a mansion

  yes a fine house

  whatll they do with hisns money
now 

  hisns money a listener blurted
out it warnt hisns money-he neveh

owned no money warnt some uns
money-mine er yours er some uns
but hes daid now an he died suffer-
in i expect he aint so plumb satis-
fied about it now-

  an hisns famly gits it now 
  probably-

  hisns wifell live on stolen money

then-

  sho jim yo wouldnt hold it
agin a woman 

  um-m no bill but i ben jes
that mad foh twenty-eight yeahs im
gittin onreasonable-yassuh we don
hold nothin agin women up thisaway
stranger i aint no man naturly to
speak thataway about a woman-no
suh that aint right 

  to bolde this was coming back home
again and he fairly reveled in the open
hearts and mountain frankness of his
boyhood people he hardly thought of
his errand there for days as he wan-
dered around guest of the mountain
victims of alexander cobvale repay-
ing them for their years-long depriva-
tions and poverty by assuring them
that the universal law of compensation
had really and unmistakably overtaken
the man who had used his talents to
take advantage of men less able and
more honorable than he was

  the news that cobvale was dead
crystallized into a desire to celebrate
the event the wish to make merry
over the punishment of the capable
thief expressed itself with bursts of
song and snatches of whistling the
whole mountain community one man
said hadnt been so happy and felt so
good in thirty years-not since cob-
vale had come with his promise to open
up the latent wealth and opportunities
of the country in fact men who had
not spoken to one another for twenty
years now stopped one another on the
road to talk about the common cause
for rejoicing and the belk-coppler
feud stopped right short just when
every one was expecting the raiding
to begin

  it was settled by common consent
that every one should come to the
schoolhouse farm down in gourd
valley and bolde rode down with si
meanness in the mountains



robs family early in the evening
they picked up joe petes family on the
way and as they came out on the
mountainside where they could over-
look the valley they saw the people
of the hills flocking down toward the
farm some in the valleys in wagons
some on horseback and some footing
it across lots

  many had already arrived and as
the stranger came up with his host they
gathered around for there were still
many to hear the story of the shooting
and its appropriate consequences
bolde had the ledger with him and
as he was rather tired of repeating the
story over and over again he nimbly
diverted the attention of the people to
the things the ledger told he read off
entries and as he named the victims
there were exclamations of recognition
and mutterings out of the past

  he died about seven year after-
ward one said of a name

  he war all broke up about losin
that he died about ten years ago

  i disremember him i expect he
war a feller come up out the railroad
townswith the old feller

 why that air mus be missus
wapes i neveh knowed she had that
much money in her life the neighbors
buried her when she died

  pete als boy that was he said
if they could rob him he could rob
them-i member that he got killed
out west somers sticking up a rail-
road train

  so the audience commented on the
names and some old men and old
women for a moment had the eyes of
all on them for they had been victims
and in some measure the renewed sym-
pathy of their neighbors and the fact
that cobvale died a-sufferin was
compensation for the woes that they
had endured at his hands

  new arrivals came riding up and
they hitched their horses to the split-
rail fence hastening to join the grow-
ing crowd at last some one thought
that they were imposing on the stran-
ger and a whisper went around the
crowd so bolde was suddenlv relieved
of his task a score came to shake

hands with him and thank him for
making the matter so plain to them
all they had never understood just
how the crooked financier had robbed
them the grand total of the shortage
-more than two hundred and eighty-
seven thousand dollars-was far be-
yond their comprehension as a
quantity but divided up among the
hundreds they could understand-espe-
cially those who had been among the
victims

  most of the afternoon was passed
in visiting back and forth by com-
mon consent again the guns and re-
volvers were put in a little room in
the farmhouse and the hereditary ene-
mies of even three generations discov-
ered not without a bashful openitig
that they had a common cause of mu-
tual good humor and so the way was
paved for peace in the mountains-
good will and understanding amqng
the common people with a common
bond of sympathy and rejoicing

  bolde a little hoarse from so much
talking and almost lepturing on high
finance mixed with the people he
wondered what they would say if they
should suddenly discover that he was
up there to take the man who had
avenged their wrongs away to be tried
for his life it was a situation that
tried his nerve and courage but he
watched the newcomers studied the
gaits of the old men and tried to pene-
trate their thoughts two or three
times when a hill billy came in lean and
old and crafty-eyed bolde almost felt
that he had the man in sight at last
but each alarm proved false

  he wet his lips as he considered that
the old man would very likely recog-
nize him and perhaps lead the mob
to kill him and then use his body as
renewed cause for rejoicing happily
he had several days growth of beard
on his face and he had purchased suit-
able woolen clothes and shoes for his
part as timber looker even to compass
and hatchet for blazing lines

  night fell and with it a feeling of
relief in the arkness in the event
of an attack he would have some
chance of getting away there was a


the popular magazine

great feast spread on tables from which
every one helped himself and the wom-
en kept the dishes heaped up lighted
by bonfires and lanterns and lamps the
house yard presented a scene for the
detective to study having as he had
an inside view of the situation he ate
and drank with the rest and praised
the hot bread and barbecued meats and
the jellies and -auces

  as he ate a sandwich of turkey-gob-
bler breast and soda biscuit he became
conscious of a sharp gaze fastened on
him from somewhere in the crowd it
was not the casual stare of curiosity
and wonder but the fixed observation
of a suspicious man or suspicious peo-
ple he realized the menace of the
scrutiny before he detected the one who
was responsible for it

  he moved cautiously away from the
lights and in the most casual manner
tried to draw whoever was suspicious
of him from the hiding place in the
crowd for him the whole tone of the
gathering had changed almost instinc-
tively and now that his mind was thor-
oughly aroused to the thought his
mountain blood responded to the call
of his profession he felt and believed
that the man for whom he was search-
ing was there in the crowd and had
either recognized him or suspected him
which might amount to the same thing
in that gathering

  no one seemed to follow him and
the feeling of distrust went by he
had seen a pair of sharp keen eyes back
in the shadows around the table but
they had vanished when he caught their
gaze

  after a time he heard music in the
house and working that way he found
the dancing beginning the fiddler was
playing with all his might-an old man
smooth-shaven his face fairly shining
in the light with sweat and soap bolde
who liked music slowly worked his
way around to the corner where the
musician sat and plumped down on a
stool some one happened to vacate just
as bolde came along

  the fiddler gave him one glance and
played on boisterously bolde had not
seen him before at the gathering and

he was puzzled by the apparent offish-
ness of the man one of the boys
had a banjo and was picking at the
strings ineffectually when bolde asked
for it the boy gave it over and the
next minute when he had tuned it to
the fiddle he ripped in roaring chords
and joined the fiddler with the music

  hi-i hi-i hue-e-e  one of the
dancers yelped at the added volume of
sound and then the feet of sixteen
mountain couples crashed on the floor
as they leaped to the tune of cut me
down my husky

  the fiddler looked around with a
grin of approval and called the changes
in the- singsong chant of the old-time
mountain player

  hi hi hi  whooped the men
the women with quick rushes
leaped from partner to partner in
women change bal-lance all
on t the nex an circle the hall
old and young the heavy and the
light whirled together with great good
cheer and at the end of the turn the
dancers were puffing and their cheeks
reddening then followed other fig-
ures-music that was swift and loud
-and cheers and whoops that grew
louder and longer as they warmed to
the occasion in spite of himself and
in spite of the part which he was play-
ing bolde found his own left foot
bounding from the floor to the wild
rhythm and beat of the mountain mu-
sic beside him the knee of a longer
leg worked up and down like a flail
pounding a foot steadily upon the plank
which boomed like a drumhead

  bolde accompanied the mountain fid-
dler through buffalo gals and then
himself took the lead through chase
the squirrel

 purty good purty good-foh a
city feller bolde heard the old man
acknowledge at the end of the set

  there was a little twang to the re-
mark a soft taunting acknowledgment
that stung bolde hardly knew what
to answer and he hesitated a moment
before looking up then it was to catch
the fleeting glance of the fiddler as he
turned away

  oh-h chase away you huskies
meanness in the mountains



drawled the fiddler as if he had not
paused to laugh at his accompanist it
flashed on bolde that perhaps the man
was jealous and he moderated the ex-
uberance of his booming banjo as he
played he observed that the mans face
was white below the shaved line then
it flashed across his senses that the
man had recently shaved a beard this
led straight to the question-why 
why

  in a moment bolde had his breath
taken by the thought by the almost
certain fact that this old man this
mountain fiddler was the one who had
gone to cumberland and shot the
banker-broker-thief sure enough now
-that he thought of it that pounding
foot that swaying body and most of
all that twanging jubilant taunting
voice-in a flash the detective had
traced the man hint by hint out of
cumberland along the mountains
through forestport firelight to this wild
orgy celebrating the cruel death of a
grave and honored citizen out in civi-
lization he wondered if the man rec-
ognteed him-and with difficulty he re-
strained a shudder lest the old man was
playing him tormenting him waiting
to do him to death as he had waited
years to murder cobvale

  change followed change set fol-
lowed set there was an intermission
late in the evening for a lunch when
great iron pots were dug out of the
fireplace coals and the roasts of cut-
up chunks of meat were distributed
around with hot bread from the ovens
the food was assailed with alacrity
and joy to the musicians were
brought plates heaped with the best of
everything including aged smooth
fruit-stilled mountain liquor which
bolde tasted doubtfully

  drink hearty  drink hearty the
old fiddler cackled and bolde thought
he detected the hint of menace in the
bidding good liquor neveh hurt good
music

  to be clear of the invidious demand
bolde picked an opera strain on his
banjo he flashed over bits of music
from the latest songs-and at these the
fiddler recognizing their gayety and

 beauty leaned eagerly forward to lis-
 ten and to remember the strains-a
 fact that bolde was not slow to ob-
 serve he played quicksteps waltzes
 fragments of venerable classics seem-
 ingly not noticing the sudden wistful-
 ness that made the aged eyes of the
 fiddler swim

  sho exclaimed the old man
 you-all play that kind ofmusic its
 written music-its music-music out
 of the shows we dont have that kind
 of music up yearaway that aint ouh
 kind of music it arent mountang mu-
 sic i low-i low you-alld come stay
 with me an show me that kind o mu-
 sic-huh 

   as he spoke he seemed to follow
 the banjo strains almost unconsciously
 bolde was puzzled by the mans tone
 but he resisted his inclination to look
 at him

   its for him bolde muttered
 hes daid this musics for alex-
 ander cobvale

   aleck cobvale-sho  its foh him
 -the ole scoundral  the fiddler re-
 peated sharply theyre glad hes daid

chapter viii

  the floor manager shouted for four
more couples four moh couple this
way-foh-three-all set at the
words all set the fiddler began to
play again and with a roar the dancers
stamped to the refrain they shouted
and with wild abandon balanced
swung circled and changed it had
been years since bolde had seen the
like and now he swayed and tapped
his heel he felt like a mountain man
again

  suddenly out on the floor a man be-
gan to chant

hes daid hes daid

  another echoed

but he didnt die in bed

  and then in chorus

hes daid hes daid

but he didnt die in bed

  a loud guffaw of laughter followed
and from all sides came jeers and jests
about the man who had been killed
the old fiddler smiled grimly never
losing a note he even chuckled when
one impromptu doggerel maker sang

  out of the mountangs came a man

a shootin iron in his good right han

  he took a whack at old cobvale

shot him through and made him pale

  hoa-a-a-y shouted the prancing
listeners and there was a roar of de-
light till after daybreak when they
could see to go home and when they
were well tired and surfeited with sav-
age jubilation they danced and shout-
ed then they had a farewell hoe-
down in which all joined hands to cir-
cle all then balanced all and finally
cut er down mchoover the old
fiddler himself rising to his feet to give
a long limb a better purchase on a bull-
hide heel and sole mountain-cobbled
shoe

  then as the thundering died away
and quiet fell bolde heard the men
grunt aitd the women gasp some one
remarked in a loud voice

  there we shore danced that old
feller out the world

 many laughed aloud and some
chuckled deeply-the old fiddler deep-
est of all and bolde glanced at him
startled by the tone and feeling in the
sound which made him fairly shiver
his thoughts spanned the interval be-
tween the mountain valley and the
splendid mansion back in cumberland
-the fiendish glee of the simple woods-
men and the mourning in the cultured
hearts a word from the fiddler drove
the reverie out to make way for the
business at hand

  ready the fiddler asked

  bolde nodded though he noted a cer-
tain sharpness in the old mans tone
that compelled his watchfulness as he
started the homegoers stopped him to
shake hands and bid him stay with
them a while when he should come past
laurel top persimmon orchard and
other places they named they were
glad to meet him they said we jes
love to hyar yo talk an play-yas-
suh

  they wranted to ask him about the
outside world where he had come from
and especially they desired to hear
again the entrancing details of how the
quality man who had stolen so much
from them had died at last sufferin
an kickin-he kicked didnt he jes
like a hard-hit deer er squirrel

  bolde watching the old man out of
the corner of his eye expected every
minute to see him unmask the detec-
tive  but as the fiddler wrorked through
the crowd bolde wondered if the man
was not inveigling him out into the wil-
derness to have the satisfaction of him-
self murdering the one who was try-
ing to take him back to justice-for
bolde could hardly doubt that the old
man knew him to be a detective so
keen was the scrutiny so watchful and
jeering the manner of the old man
and yet he could not be certain in
any event he was glad when at last they
were striding along the road farther
and farther away from the others it
wrould be easier to guard himself
against an individual than a crowd

  the old fiddler led the way on foot
meanness in the mountains



his course was up the main valley he
strode along with his violin case under
his arm his broad-brimmed black hat
which bolde now recognized crushed
down over his brows his steps as
he bent forward at the hips were long
and swift he seemed oblivious of his
companion who found the gait trying

  if he knew me bolde meditated
hed never turn his back on me up
this woods road where i could capture
him and rush him over the mountains
to jail

  none overtook the two musicians
they tramped faster than the doubly-
laden horses and much faster than the
weary-walking merrymakers bolde
scanned the country the bottoms
were cleared but the timber line
extended far down the valley side
some of the farms seemed prosperous
a few of them having fall-plowed corn-
fields surrounded by split-rail fences
cabins on knolls overlooked long
ranges of mountains he caught
glimpses of tiny shacks in little clear-
ings above the timber line

   as they advanced up the valley away
from the people the old man slacked
his pace several times to peer into the
brush and following his glance bolde
spied a flock of wild turkeys feeding
or scudding away and a late home-
comer of the raccoon tribe in one
crossing the old man lifted a leaf out
of a deer track to see the clean imprint
of a buck that had crossed the bottoms
the night before

  so his guide and host tramped on
along the bottom road and miles up
the valley where the ranges of hills
drew closer together and the woods
pressed down to the level of the river
banks the fiddler bore up to the left
out of the clearing into the woods and
up into the higher mountains near the
divide at the head of the streams that
flowed east and west down adjoining
watersheds

  on the steep grade the old man
slacked his pace he even stopped to
drink at a spring which poured out
of the pitted limestone when he was
through drinking he waited for his
companion to drink then he started

on at a more leisurely pace as if he
enjoyed the barking of the squirrels
the drumming of the pheasants and the
distant gobble of a turkey challenging
his kind for combat

  on and up through more miles of
mountain land they came at last to a
peeled-iog cabin set against a mountain
rock there was a little garden partly
spaded up there toas no fence and
there was a well-worn chair beside the
door the man dropped into the chair
with a sigh glad to be home again

  he drew from his coat a snack
which some one had put up for him
he spread it on top of a log and spoke
for the first time

  set up he said

  bolde well tired now ate slowly
he found it difficult to maintain his
dumb demeanor he munched away
in silence having eaten the old man
led the way into the hut which was
dry and comfortable there was a
bunk covered with deer hides on one
side on the other was another bunk
on which was spread a clean quilt

  betteh rest up the fiddler said
pointing at the quilted bunk

  bolde glanced at the clean bedding
and then down at his own dust-be-
grimed clothes without a word he
turned out of the cabin walked down
to the brook and bathed when he re-
turned the fiddler looked at him with a
shrewd light in his eyes remarking

  i reckon you-all had quality bring-
in up-yassuh 

  bolde laughed and crawled into the
bunk nestling down in tired comfort
so they slept away the demands of na-
ture for the long night and long miles
they had traveled it was comfort-
real and healthy comfort boldes
awakening came to the strains of mu-
sic he started up wondering that he
-a man hunter-should have slept so
soundly that he did not hear his host
stir up the fire and put on the pail of
coftee which was simmering over the
flames the man was trying to re-
call the adaptation from chopin he
was practicing

  the visitor slipped out of the bunk
and dressed picking up a banjo he


the popular magazine

sat down on a block of wood and
joined in with the fiddlers doubtful ef-
forts he picked away slowly and dis-
tinctly and the mountain mans quick
ear selected the notes for his own in-
strument  so they soon were rollick-
ing along together to the great aston-
ishment of a gray squirrel which came
jouncing but into the little opening
chickering and barking

  after supper they played for hours
before the fireplace bolde thought
time and again to try and get the old
man to talk but something in his bear-
ing prevented an opening the silence
made the detective feel ill at ease the
fiddler almost ignored him except when
they were playing together it was as
if the man was brooding having for-
gotten how to talk after years of half-
hermit life in the timber country

  there was more than mere strange-
ness in the mans bearing he moved
with uncanny sureness he stepped with
the brisk lightness of an old hunter
and there was in his bearing and mo-
tions an untamed grace bolde had the
uneasy feeling which one notices at
sight of a cat stalking a bird or squir-
rel he had seen a few men like that
before with the result that he could
not rid himself of the feeling that at
some time or other he had met this
man and had much to do with him
the old man was up before daybreak
the second morning fiddling away

  its goin to rain he said softly to
his guest who was startled by the mu-
sic laws its plumb lonely when
it storms an storms

  yes-its as bad as being in a de-
serted town when it burns up

  did you see forestport burn the
fiddler exclaimed

  yes i came up to look over the
old dolomo development patent i was
caught there the night it burned
you say you was thats where
you got the old book let me see it
agin-whats that old newspaper

  he opened the sheet that bolde had
saved from the undistributed edition of
the forestport bloom and read 

forestport goes bust

  the old mans hands trembled an
angry spot blazed in his eyes and when
he spoke his voice was husky

  yes hesaid i know it-i hearn
about it-but i neveh blieved it-i
neveh los my faith in that man-till

-till-

  he spread the paper on the floor
and bolde looking down saw him read
over the page

  i neveh believed that ole feller
cobvale could lie thataway i jes
lowed it would be all right an i neveh
paid no tention to what these yeah
igerant mountang fellers talked i
lowed when i jes went to him er his
theyd give me that yeah money jes
like id a done er any hones man
laws i neveh lowed they was sech
men-neveh-neveh if it had been
killing meanness er thataway-but it
warnt it were money meanness
what for they want to steal a mans
money-sho

  he sat limply in his chair for a time
meditating on his wrongs and then his
indignation began to grow

  he stole my money i neveh would
a blieved it till i seen forestport i
neveh knowed it war all daid laws
it made me mad clar through-yassuh
-i was a-biiin-sho i hearn say
there want no law for the rich man

but-but this yeah is law- hans

up you plumb ridiculous fool boy
detector-hans up

  bolde was looking into the muzzle of
a black pistol and his hands went up

chapter ix

  the old mountain man glared into
the eyes of the detective whom he had
tricked jeering and hating him with
all his heart

  you-all come here to get me fer
punishing the man who stole my
money he cried you-all come here
to take me back to hang you reckon
i dont know who you-all was after id
watched that air brick house lookin
fer old cobvale sho i seen yo an
i lowed to kill ye you catch ole ab-
ner coil thataway laws
meanness in the mountains



  at that name bolde started and
stared

 abner coil he gasped old
uncle abner

  the muzzle of the pistol quivered
and the eyes beyond the sights blinked

  what you-all know about old ab-
ner coil  the man demanded

  why-why you were to forestport
a while in a little log cabin when i was
a little chap--orville bolde my mother
was a widow woman

  the widow bolde the old man
muttered his thoughts racing back into
the past an you come here to arrest
uncle abner-old abner who was
robbed

  boldes eyes dropped and he flinched
under the old mans stern gaze in his
heart bolde was a mountain man and
he had come after the murderer of
aleck cobvale in order to get back
what cobvale had stolen from his
mother by securing the reward money
he had looked at the money not at the
man whom he would bring back to the
gallows

  he robbed mother too was all
bolde could answer

  an yo never killed im yosef  an
him right thar

  i was just waiting bolde answered
weakly some day i expect id a
killed him

  if yo is like your daddy you would
-yassuh the old man nodded me
n him fought side by side in the war
-yassuh

  the gun was lowered and shoved
across the table against the wall and
the two men stared into the fireplace
neither speaking for a long time and
over them whelmed the weariness of
lack of sleep the intense strain of
antagonism gone they began to nod
and the old man waved his hand toward
a bunk the detective crept under the
homespun blankets and went to sleep
sound as a bear

  when they both awoke they could
think better the old man had had a
dream he dreamed he said that he
saw a deer fawn growing up on the
mountainside it lost its spots and be-
came a yearling buck then it grew

spike horns bootjacks and finally great
antlers the hair around its ears and
horns began to turn gray and its eyes
dim one day the deer was eating
acorns when a shot rang out and the
animal was killed

  it has meaning coil said it has
meaning--for me

  he puzzled over the dream a long
while and then he nodded his head

  i see-i understand when the
deer was old and gray it was time to
die im old and gray-im the old
buck

  bolde looked at him doubtfully won-
dering what the old man meant

  i aint no good any more and the
old buck aint no good no more-but
hes meat when hes daid im goin
back with you-all to cumberland-yas-
suh youll git the reward im your
meat sonny your mammyll git back
the money aleck cobvale stole

  me take you back bolde ex-
claimed horror-stricken at the idea for
now to his mind the mountain man
had been the instrument of justice as
well as his mothers old friend

  suttinly the old man nodded

  never

  abner coil began to gather up a little
pack of clothes trinkets and his fiddle

  reckon itll be some time ill have
to set around the jail he remarked
an id miss the fiddle twixt giving
up an gittin hung

  boldes mind was stunned by the old
mans determination and in his imag-
ination he saw a lank figure swinging
on the rough-sawed gallows

  listen he exclaimed you stay
here uncle abner dont you go out
with me its the cobvales who offer
the big reward ill see his son-

  but he wont give up no rewards
till he sees me in jail

  well see-i know that kind

  three days later dctective bolde en-
tered the office of the aqueduct bond
and brokerage company where sat
wallace cobvale in charge

  how do you do mr bolde wal-
lace greeted did you get him


thb popular magazine

  yes hes located it was old abner
coil

   wha-what that old scoundrel
yes and hell come in for trial if
you want him

  if i want him i want him hungi
of course he said i should tell you
so-he got the drop on me he said
hed stand trial and bring down all
the clinch county witnesses to tell
what they suffered from your father
the young man started and wet his
lips as he glanced at the dolomo de-
velopment map on the wall then he
asked stammeringly

  what-what do they say they suf-
fered

  your father came there and found-
ed a bank-started that company-
founded a place called forestport
when they looked over your fathers
private account book they found he
was two hundred and eighty-seven
thousand dollars short

  the lips of the young man turned
blue-his face white he fumbled with
his white hands picking at the ring
his sweetheart-now his wife-had
given him

 and that-and that-

  will all come out at the trial
but--but we cant have that why
man we mustnt have that itd ruin
my social position-ruin my whole ca-
reer 

 the detective who saw the young
man tormented between the idea of let-
ting his fathers murderer escape and
of ruining his social prospects made
no comment

 has it got to come out young
cobvale demanded

  the old man and all his friends
have tongues

 the young man shivered 

 well-why-perhaps-its done
whats the use i-i think wed better
let it drop

  he turned as if that ended it

 how about the reward bolde
asked softly

 why-why-you didnt bring him
in dead or alive the young man
smiled a shrewd and triumphant little
grin

  oh bolde exclaimed if thats it
ill go bring him in alive good day
the young man snarled

 what-what -hold on i-i was
only fooling

  i wasnt

  do-dont get mad old man i-
of course the reward is yours-natu-
rally

  he reached for his check book he
drew a check for five thousand dollars
and handed it over

  of course bolde said the county
cant pay me that other thousand if i
dont bring him in

  the young man glared at him but
thought better of making any remark
he drew another check-this one for
six thousand dollars the detective put
it into his pocketbook and rose to go
when his hand was on the doorknob
the son desiring to make certain of
his social position thought of some-
thing else

  oh say he began how about that
old account book-the ledger

 you mean your fathers why
they said up there in the mountains that
they would keep it very carefully in
case any one should try to dispossess
any of the people from their old rights
in the timberlands-they thought they
had better good day

  as he turned he saw the young mans
clenched teeth wide-open lips and an-
gry glare-which mollified instantly

  say-say mr bolde-theyll keep
that ledger safe if we leave em alone
wont they the young man asked
hopefully

the rabbits foot

by charles r barnes
author of the sweeny storiesetc

     how much is it worth to be the owner of the left hind
     foot of a graveyard rabbit killed in the dark of the moon
     or whenever it is they have to be killed to bring luck

young baker was big and broad
and brave his six feet of
sturdy manhood that had
ripped topieces charging foot-
ball plays loomed beside the skinny
stooping frame of worden like a sky-
scraper over a dog kennel the young
fellow knew that he need fear no vio-
lence at the hands of the old man and
yet he had hesitated before entering
the acme construction companys of-
fices they could not throw him out
that he knew he was more than a
match for old worden and all of his
aenemic clerks put together but there
was not much of assurance in the man-
ner of the trimly dressed young ath-
lete even after he was face to face with
worden and been almost cordially wel-
comed

  sit down the old fellow had said
and baker still bereft of his usual
breezy confidence had carefully seated
himself

  what can i do for you asked
worden

  the younger man was silent for a
moment then he spoke slowly de-
liberately choosing his words with
great care

  i have come to make a request
said he but before i make it i wish
to tell you my circumstances-

  worden interrupted

  see here-the words came sharply
-i got your fathers money away
from him fairly and squarely he
couldnt hold onto it somebody would
have grabbed it i did now what
are you going to do about it

  baker flushed

  nothing he answered i didnt
come to see you about that you were
a bit smoother than my father and you
ruined him im old enough to know
that its dog eat dog in the business
world if father had been a shrewder
man than you id probably be as big
a proposition in the acme company
as yourself but it was the other way
and im not here to complain about it
i came on a mission that has nothing
to do with business

  what is it came the quick ques-
tion

  i came repeated baker to tell
you about louise and me we have
decided to get married

  wordens shriveled figure straight-
ened he looked out of the window
for a moment then turned his old eyes
upon the caller

  you have he asked there was a
trace of derision in his voice

  we have the young man affirmed
and we hope with your consent
what if i say no -
there was no reply bakers square
jaw was set it may be that the old
president of the acme company read
an answer in it for he did not press the
question instead he squinted care-
fully at the man who would wed his
daughter he noted the good points of
him-and there were many the keen
blue eyes the aggressive nose the de-
termined chin and the magnificent
physique that was there to stand back
of these red-blooded characteristics at
the end of a minute admiration glis-


the popular magazine

tened in wordens look but he turned
his head to conceal it

   ive had an idea he saiit that
 something of the kind was in the air
 he dropped into his chair ive noth-
 ing against you baker youve had
 it in for me and i cant blame you

 your father was worth--lets see-

   a half million was the prompt in-
 formation

  yes yes-a half million-all of
 that worden teetered back and
 forth a half million your father
 was wild with anger when he lost it
 if he had lived im pretty sure that
 hed have got it back-pretty sure but
 he didnt live and he didnt get the
 money back i have it and you
 havent a cent now talk what do
 you want me to do for you

   nothing was the prompt answer
 in a financial sense im ready to let
 bygones be bygones you broke father
 through methods that the business
 world calls honest i dont want the
 money back i want louise and
 youre mistaken when you say i have
 - nothing i made two thousand dollars
 out of that whitney case-and the law
 business wasnt so bad before that ive
 saved a little there are prospects too
 im trying to get the union traction
 business and it may be thrown to me
 then there are other things

   outline them ordered worden
 baker went on to explain his cir-
 cumstances he told the ol fellow of
 the various irons he had in the fire-a
 company he was promoting a real-es-
 tate deal and sundry other items in-
 cluding an effort he was making to
 represent an insurance company in the
 loaning of its money any listener
 would have concluded that baker
 would be immensely rich at the end of
 six months or that he was a good
 talker worden became absorbed in
 thought but he didnt say what he
 thought presently he concluded the
 interview

   youre a clean young man he said

 and if louise wants you i- he

 waved a skinny hand to indicate that he
 had nothing further to say only re-
 member you cant live on dreams

  the young man thanked him and
left the place and a few minutes later
a young lady unduly pink as to her
cheeks heard over the telephone the
result of the interview

  oh she exclaimed i thought
youd have a lot more trouble with him
than that there was more conver-
sation which need not be set down here
the girls last words were

  i feel that things are going to come
out fine when you get home there
will be a package waiting for you-a
very small one i saw something in a
window yesterday that i want you to
have it will bring luck im going
right downtown now and get it for
you

  what is it baker asked

  wait and see the girl laughed
and that wras all he could get out of
her

  that evening though when he ar-
rived at his apartment the riddle was
quickly solved sure enough a small
package awaited him he found a tiny
oblong box on the table-something big
enough to hold a cigar holder or a
scarfpin quickly he untied the string
tore off the wrapping paper and
opened the little white box that was in-
side then he laughed

  i thought it was going to be a horse-
shoe he grinned afterward he dug
out a note that had been crammed into
the box it was penciled in louises
writing and read

  this is the best i could do the man
assured me that it is the left hind foot of
a graveyard rabbit killed in the dark of
the moon or whenever it is they have to be
killed to bring luck please carry it put
it in your pocket and always touch it be-
fore you tackle any project the man who
sold it to me said that you have to do that
to make it work if it turns out to be no
good ill know why because i showed it
to old mr ballard who was in the store
and he said something perfectly horrid-but
i know he was only joking please wear it
for me	louise

  baker stood still stroking the fur
that clung to the little mascot it was
a beautiful example of taxidermy gold-
mounted and highly polished wherever
it could be for some time it lay in
the young mans hand then he slipped
thb rabbits foot



it into his pocket but he had scarcely
done so when he drew it forth again

  what did old man ballard say he
muttered turning i over and over
carefully he examined it but the only
thing of interest he could find was a
mark k stamped into the gold
mounting and presently as the ques-
tion appeared unanswerable he again
put the rabbits foot in his pocket and
decided that miss louise would no
doubt relieve his mind of worry when
he saw her again

 some mail awaited him he was
about to slit open one of the envelopes
whenhis eye caught the return address
in the left-hand upper corner he
paused and then like a woman turned
the letter over and over for the name
he read was john j mehan who was
one of the big railroad attorneys-a
man known throughout the country

  i wonder- mused young baker

he slid a knife under the envelope
flap and was removing the inclosure
when a silly abashed smile spread over
his face slowly his right hand went
into the pocket where the rabbits foot
reposed and the fingers shamedly
stroked the soft fur they met

  she said that i should touch it be-
fore i tackled anything he muttered
maybe it wont do any harm to play
the string out according to her rules
he removed the letter from the envel-
ope and read

  my dear sir can you find it convenient
to call at my office to-morrow morning at
eleven oclock there is something i wish
to consult you about perhaps you know
that this firm is handling the walsh case
it is a matter of consequence and one in
which you may be of considerable help to
me if you can be persuaded to lend your
assistance drop in and let us have a talk

yours truly	john j mehan

 mehan the walsh case still
holding the letter baker began to pace
slowly up and down the room he had
been asked in to help the biggest lawyer
in the whole middle west and his help
had been solicited in one of the most
important damage cases against a rail-
road that had appeared on the court
calendar in years the fee would be a
large one-and the reputation the

young man sank into a chair overcome
then at length he began to think
somehow the words in the girls note
came back to him together with the
query

  what did old man ballard say

  ballard didnt amount to much he
was merely an old fusser who haunted
society affairs and cracked antique
jokes yet he and his words seemed
in some way to belong in the scheme
of things-in the new scheme that had
come into being with the rabbits foot
what had he said and why in the
sacred name of blackstone had mehan
picked such an obscure attorney as
baker to assist him in the walsh case

  the rabbits foot  pshaw the
young lawyer was far too sane and
healthy to consider that fuzzy little ar-
ticle as more than a keepsake over
which one might grow foolish did he
so desire you could rub it if you
wanted to but you only did it because
some one for whom you cared a lot told
you to there was no such thing as
luck no sir hard work careful work
conscientious work was what counted
luck was something for the ignorant
to consider and to believe in there
was no place for it in the analytical
mind of a lawyer

  later that evening the young man
found himself trying to tease the words
of old man ballard out of miss louise
but she would not repeat them

  arent you in on the walsh case
she asked

  i suppose so baker replied

  well then the girl reminded him
my little mascot is working isnt it
so what does it matter what that fool-
ish old mr ballard said you stroked
the rabbits foot and you found all
that nice writing inside of the envelope
immediately afterward so the charm
must be working i dont see why i
should tell you what a drooly old man
cackled at me it might spoil your
faith

  but tell me what it was he in-
sisted

  ill not you keep on stroking that
rabbits foot and getting good luck


the popular magazine

let well enough alone and that was
all she would say on the subject

  so baker wrent home minus old man
ballards statement but not at all wor-
ried about it the morning promised
one of the biggest things that ever had
occurred in his life and he was happy
and contented over the prospects

 the interview with mehan next
morning was brief but fruitful the
young man was told that he had been
highly indorsed by influential interests
that he was regftded as an able young-
ster who was sure to give an account
of himself that there was some leg
work to be done in the walsh case
would he do it his name would be
printed in the newspapers as associate
counsel perhaps he would be givefi
a chance to do some talking in court
would he take the chance 

 he would and he said so very
promptly from mehans office he
walked to his own place of business
highly elated his breast was full of
a world-conquering spirit old wor-
den evidently didnt think so highly of
him-yet but wait worden was a
power in the community but one of
these times a certain charles b baker
would wield qnite as much influence
the young lawyer had been conscious
all along that he had youth and strength
and ability and now he had his
chance wait

  in his own office a visitor was await-
ing him it was lawrence l moore a
retired capitalist with whom baker had
been dickering about the merging of
three manufacturing interests in the
city the whole deal turned on the find-
ing of one hundred thousand dollars of
outside capital baker had been trying
his best to induce the capitalist to fur-
nish the money and when he saw the
man in his office he knew that the busi-
ness on hand concerned the merger
furtively he slipped his hand into his
pocket and rubbed the rabbits foot

  good morning mr moore he be-
gan opening the door of his inner of-
fice and motioning the visitor to step
inside

 moore was a fussy man of few
words

  ill go into that merger he said
ill take fifty thousand of the stock
friend of mine thinks it a good thing
and is going in too make out all the
certificates in my name-hundred thou-
sand ill transfer them friend
doesnt want to appear now he takes
the other fifty thousand

  for an instant baker was almost
stunned with the suddenness of it the
successful promotion of that merger
ineant twenty-five thousand dollars to
him

  im glad to hear you say that
stammered the lawyer for some rea-
son his hand again went into the pock-
et where the rabbits foot lay

  fix up the papers ordered moore
as has been mentioned he was a man
of few words the interview lasted
only a minute or so longer but at its
end baker was richer by twenty-five
thousand dollars

  young baker never forgot the occur-
rences of the week that followed

  the days had been eventful one
afternoon three men came to see him
about a tract of suburban real estate on
which he had an option they told
him that the land had been called to
their attention and that they would
consider the purchase of it provided
the price was within reason they
were allotment men who had success-
fully promoted many own-your-own-
home propositions baker knew them
and he realized that they meant busi-
ness so he named a figure that would
give him a profit of ten thousand dol-
lars

  it looks good to us the men said
and when they left there lay on bak-
ers table a check representing the down
payment

  the suddenness with which the tide
of his fortunes had turned and the
large profit that was coming in elated
and surprised the custodian of the rab-
bits foot then it set him thinking
fie went to the girl with a mind per-
plexed

  i dont understand it he began
a week ago i had nothing but pros-
pects now i have enough to-
the rlits foot



  to furnish a-a home she de-
murely inquired

  yes and a lot more than that but
it doesnt seem right somehow the
luck just pours in on me theres
something unusual-id call it artificial

-its unreal- he looked at her

helplessly

  but the rabbits foot louise re-
minded him that ought to account
for it

  theres something queer about that
too he said ive stroked it till some
of the hide is wearing off-there was
a sheepish expression in his eyes-and
it always works do they always work
like that i had an idea that horse-
shoes and luck pennies and such things
fell down on the job now and then
but my mascot never misses fire tell
me what did old man ballard say
the girl wouldnt tell him

  hes an old bore she exclaimed
and he doesnt know what he is talk-
ing about most of the time so it
makes no difference at all what he
said she changed the subject plow
are you getting along with that case
against the railroad 

  he explained the work he had done
walsh has a good case he told her
the railroad company will be lucky to
get off with paying half of what walsh
is suing for to tell the truth i dont
think we have a chance of winning
and mehan tells me that im to ap-
pear in court for him-harangue the
jury and all that

  when is the case to be tried asked
louise

  day after to-morrow was the re-
ply the girl thought deeply for a mo-
ment then two bright fires appeared in
her eyes her chceks glowed prettily
and she earnestly advised

  before you siy a word to those
jurymen stroke that rabbits foot
those wrords were echoing in bakers
brain when two days later he faced
the jury to tell the railroads side of the
great case he was not at all confi-
dent  even the touch of the furry thing
in his pocket failed to reassure him
as he looked into the faces of the jury-
men

  most of them were farmers and
baker remembered that ever so many
farmers hold grudges against traction
interests because of cows tossed in the
air by locomotives dangerous grade
crossings and tilts in court always won
by the railroads so he began his plea
in a half-hearted manner fully expect-
ing a verdict against mehans client
and heavy damages awarded to walsh

  during a glance about the room he
was startled and surprised to note the
presence of old worden and miss
louise they had come no doubt ac-
tuated by different reasons the girl
hoped to be proud of him worden
wanted to determine his ability as a
lawyer and as there seemed to be
a sarcastic twinkle in the old fellows
eyes baker immediately concluded that
his father-in-law to be was there to
laugh at a fledgling lawyers failure in
his first big case

  this however instead of further
discouraging him spurred him on to
better endeavor and he soon found
himself hammering home truths to that
jury in no uncertain tones and every
few minutes his hand stole to his pock-
et and rubbed the rabbits foot if it
brought him luck in this instance he
reasoned it could do anything

  the twelve good men and true re-
mained out two minutes when they
again took their seats in the box the
foreman handed in a verdict for the
railroad company baker had won his
case

  for a few minutes the young man
was busy receiving congratulations
then worden pushed forward crowd-
ed through the group of handshakers
and touched the barrister on the arm

  lets have a talk he said louise
and you and i will go to luncheon some-
where

  baker agreed and soon the three
were seated about a table in a down-
town restaurant after the order had
been given worden began to talk

  you did pretty well to-day he
complimented pretty fair ive con-
cluded that you have the making of a
good lawyer in you you see ive
been sounding you out


the popular magazine

  how asked baker puzzled the
girls face showed intense interest

  i put mehan up to taking you in
on that case went on worden you
see i have quite a bit of influence about
this town i wanted to see what was
in you-and mehan is a good friend of
mine

  baker stared he looked valcafitly at
louise then his eyes opened wide as
if a flood of truth was sweeping through
his brain

  i understand h exclaimed i un-
derstand now he turned to louise
didnt i tell you that the luck seemed
artificial-that it didnt have the ring
of the real thing-that it was artificial 
yes artificial is the word artificial
worden grinned

  moore and i looked into your mer-
ger he went on and as there didnt
seem to be any reason why the busi-
ness shouldnt prosper we went into
it by the way how much promotion
mone did you get out of our hundred
thousand 

  twenty-five thousand replied
baker in a low voice worden
laughed

  youre a robber all right he com-
mented you ought to make good at
the law well that will go quite a
way in evening up things between us
boy he said lowering his voice
youre going to have all that i took
from your father before im through
im going to get the deal off my con-
science that is one reason why i ad-
vised those fellows to buy your real
estate im a highly successful busi-
ness man and people take my advice
when i give it

  baker stared dumfounded

  whew he whistled so thats
why they were so easy

  i told them wordei explained
that the property was about the best
buy i knew of as i said people take
my advice when i give it i started a
few other deals for you but the
walsh case-well i knew the railroad

would take care of that jury-r

  i know the young man interrupt-
ed you neednt explain i can see
your hand in things but why-

  worden glanced at louise

  shes pretty expensive he said
a mans got to have a lot of money
to keep her going then soberly
but your father boy-the trick i
turned on him im getting old-and
there are so ne things in the lives of
all of us that wed like to forget-or
do over again he faced his daugh-
ter there was  nothing dishonest
about it but i might have acted dif-
ferently and this boys father might
not have died poor now all i can do
is to make amends in the second gen-
eration young man youll be the most
successful lawyer in the city before a
year has passed remember that

  during the remainder of the time
the party was at table little was said
wrhen the three arose louise caught
baker by the arm

  youll have to excuse us father
she said for i have something very
very important to talk over with mr
baker come  she ordered  and they
went out upon the street the girl
walking rapidly led the way to a jew-
elers

  let him see the rabbits foot she
commanded the man examined it

  is it a real one asked louise

  no replied the jeweler its an
imitation-an artificial one

  but the girl stopped to hear no more
dragging baker out of the store she
hurried him into the street talking ex-
citedly

  thats what old mr ballard said vi
she exclaimed

  what asked the amazed baker

  he said she went on that id
probably bought an artificial rabbits
foot and he giggled he told me
that they make them in new jersey
where they weave the indian blankets
the tourists bring back from the west
and the japanese art in the auction
stores he said my rabbits foot was
artificial-and he giggled

  baker smiled

  dont worry he said i wouldnt
part with the little charm for a mil-
lion you see i cant imagine anything
better than the artificial luck my arti-
ficial rabbits foot brings

jf you go often to the theater you will
probably by this time have come to
the conclusion that after all the book
is better than the play there are a
vast number of plays turned out each
year practically none of them even
on the road last beyond the second or
at most the third season undoubtedly
it requires more technical knowledge to
write a play than a book undoubtedly
also it takes a bigger man to write a
really first-rate book the play depends
so much on the accessories-scenery
lights costumes the personalities and
abilities of the actresses and actors
when you read you yourself can supply
the accessories you have within your
own minds a sort of aladdins lamp it
will supply for you the palace or the
dungeon at your will and as it is sug-
gested by the writer let the author
describe his heroine never so minutely
she will appear to you as the type of
beauty you like best you can supply
scenery and actors to suit yourself if
the story is a good one you can have
imaged in your mind as you read finer
scenery than belasco could design and
all without stirring out of the house on
a winter evening

a a

the stage of the theater while it
presents some advantages also has
certain limitations which hamper the
creative artist of the highest type it
has been proved by experience that a
real mystery story cannot be presented
dramatically the whole essence of a

mystery story is that the author keep
to himself the solution and end of the
tale and that the reader must guess
think of ail the plays you have ever
seen you cannot recall one in which
anything was held back from the audi-
ence everybody on the stage may be
ignorant as to where the villain has
hidden the papers or who really com-
mitted the crime but the audience knows
from the first he may have the pleas-
ure of seeing a plot work itself out to
a conclusion but he has none of the
keener pleasures of mystification and
surprise to our way of thinking this
is a big drawback the mystery story
at its best affords the keenest sort of
enjoyment it is something more than
a passive enjoyment it is a matching
of the wits of the reader against the
author in a sort of a game that lends
zest to a narrative already of interest
we all have something of the detective
in us we all like to reason to conclu-
sions and discover things for ourselves
and all this is barred from the stage
it is impossible there from the very
nature of a dramatic performance you
can only find it within the covers of a
book or magazine we think you have
found it more than once in the pop-
ular and we know you will again-
very soon

	

phe mystery story is one of the most
popular types of fiction and prob-
ably almost every writer tries it once or
twice the really successful writers of
   a chat with you-continued
the mystery tale are very few indeed
only one or two to every generation
you get all the best of them in the
popular and in the next issue out two
weeks from to-day you will get the first
installment of a new mystery story by
burton stevenson ever since steven-
son wrote the holladay case and
the marathon mystery he has occu-
pied a place by himself as a writer of
this sort of fiction he builds his plots
so well he tells so much to the reader
without revealing -the final secret his
manner is so convincing and his nar-
rative flows with such a rippling ease
that it is impossible to stop reading
you know all this yourself if you read
this magazine about a year ago when
his last story the buhl cabinet ap-
peared it is now in book form among
the best sellers and his new story the
mind master is ready for you you
will get the first installment in two
weeks from to-day and you will have
read the whole thing in two months
ye dont say that it is a better tale than
the buhl cabinet but we do say that
it is just as good we know of few
stories easier to read or harder to de-
scribe than this new one of stevensons
the mind master all we can say is
that we think it a great story

 

richard washburx child

who wrote the blue wall re-
turns to thi- popular in the next issue
with a short story called pizen in it
he gives you a vivid picture of the
florida keys the roll of the surf the
hot gleam of the sunlight he introduces
you to a number of strange and fas-
cinating characters a remarkable woman
detective and a still more remarkable
ex-pirate pindar rowe it is one of

those intense vivid short stories that
stay with you a long time after reading

a a

phere is another memling story by
rupert hughes in the next issue
of the popular it takes the whimsi-
cal and talented artist and his model to
paris to engage in a most ingenious
scheme to defraud the united states
government by importing masterpieces
to this country free of duty memling
may try to be a criminal but nature
more powerful than he has made him
an artist first last and all the time
his skill as a painter his artistic sin-
cerity and feeling interfere with his
progress as a smuggler read the story
it is whimsical funny and exciting

a a

hphe next issue opens with a big po-
litical novel the spellbinders
by francis lynde of course you know
lyndes work but this new story of his
is it seems to us a little better than the
average it is the story of a stirring
political campaign in a southern state
it is intensely modern in feeling and
color and is in every respect a story of
to-day there is also a splendid story
by b m bower the ghost of one
man coulee and the first half of the
best xorrov story yet the green
hour which will appear in the maga-
zine in two parts and which is un-
doubtedly the strongest thing george
bronson-howard has done in some
time then there is a western story
by emerson hough a story of news-
paper life by robert welles ritchie a
naval story by robert a bachmann an
army story by peter b kyne and a
tale of the indians in the northwest
by hulbert footner this is not all but

  fancy the joy of mrs myra wright
who having been deaf since childhood
found the means of banishing her deaf-
ness so effectually that she could hear
her clock across a large room when such
a thing was utterly impossible before
xow she is delighted to tell the good
news to all who are troubled with deaf-
ness and head-noises xo drugging was
necessary neither was mrs wright sub-
jected to an operation- in fact she

treated herself bv a simple gentle drug-
less method which anybody who needs it
can easily learn about by writing to dr
geo e coutant  c station e new
york city who will send free of charge
his book which tells how to overcome
difficulty in hearing ringing noises in
head etc mrs wright could have
saved much money and aggravation and
might have been relieved years ago if she
had only heard of this method sooner
nearest
is dearest

 always if its kelloggs that nearest
 for of all the delightful foods this dear little girl
 and the millions of other american youngsters
 know theres none that is always so welcome
 as the original-the tasty toasted com rakes

       this year they are eating over 
       packages-and eating them so fast that
       not one package ever has a chance to
       grow stale on a grocers shelves
