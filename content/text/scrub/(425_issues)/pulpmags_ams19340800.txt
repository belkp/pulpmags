old-time writing-papyrus
and vellum

 by t oconor sloane phd

it is fair to say that the first ma-
terial used for writing was a
smooth surface of stone clay too
may have been used made into a paste
and to be subsequently hardened by fir-
ing tablets with some kind of wax on
them were employed for more or less
temporary inscriptions and memoranda
then came papyrus vellum and paper

  the most ancient inscriptions in char-
acters suggesting writing are what are
known as ideographic as far as the
egyptian nation is concerned these
were little pictures of human beings
animals and other objects and they grad-
ually lost much of the pictorial charac-
ter and developed into a sort of letters
in asia minor there originated another
type of writing which seems purely
arbitrary in its characters as much so
as our present day letters this class
was formed by combinations of marks

each one resembling the cross-section of
a wedge and each one of the same size
as its neighbor they were grouped in
various ways and the grouping gave
them individual values as words or
alphabetical characters these are what
are called cuneiform hieroglyphics the
latin word for a wedge being cuneus
the tendency to an alphabet can be
traced to egyptian and asian inscrip-
tions

  the egyptian remains became an ob-
ject of study before the middle of the
last century and it certainly seems that
champollion the founder of the sci-
ence had a very obscure path to fol-
low his first deciphering goes back to
 so we have a little more than a
century to look back upon

  the egyptian hieroglyphs being def-
initely pictorial in origin it would seem
that the archaeologist who tried to de-
amazing stories



cipher them would have had an insoluble
problem but in  a stone slab with a
three-language inscription was found
near the town of rosetta at the mouth
of the nile and one of the inscriptions
was in greek this is the famous ro-
setta stone a heavy piece of basalt and
this ancient monument gave the clew to
some of the ancient eyptian words one
of the inscriptions was in what is called
the demotic character which had lost
or outlived the pictorial hieroglyphics
other such monuments have been found
which have helped in the difficult work
a number of students investigated the
subject among others thomas young
one of the most famous physicists of old
times celebrated for his work on the un-
dulatory theory of light and on the in-
terference of light waves the develop-
ment of youngs work in physics has had
a profound influence on modem astron-
omy yet in his archaeological work he
only discovered four letters

  the egyptians made great use of
seals these were made out of stone
often in the shape of beetles and the
design or seal was engraved on the flat
base under the carving of the body of
the insect these were hieroglyphs
rubbed over with coloring matter they
were used as our rubber stamps are to-
day it may be taken as the first print-
ing unless the chinese antedate it with
their block printing

  the egyptians had another type of
seal which was engraved on the surface
of a small cylinder one-half inch or
more in diameter and an inch or more in
length and this was used by rolling it
on the surface to be inscribed after the
cylinder had been coated with a coloring
pigment here the egyptians really
seemed to be ahead of us as it is fair to
say that this is the first attempt at
printing from a cylinder and to-day cyl-
inder printing presses turn out newspa-
pers at the rate of many thousands per

hour from a single complicated machine

  it would seem that the cylindrical seal
of the egyptians could be modified so
as to be used for rubber stamps the
rolling motion would be particularly ef-
fective as the pressure would be on such
a small element of the cylinder at a
time that a very excellent impression
could be looked for rubber stamp
printing is relief printing-the old egyp-
tian seals probably may be called in-
taglio printers

  one of the most characteristic plants
of egypt is the papyrus this is a large
reed which grows to a height of ten
feet and whose interior consists of a
very strong pith centuries before it
occurred to anybody to make paper this
pith used to be divided by cutting into
very thin slices which were placed to-
gether the sides having been cut very
true so as to give a very close joint
and they were crossed by other strips
similarly cut so that the finished product
was two layers thick how they were
made to adhere is not perfectly clear-
whether there was some mucilaginous or
other adhesive natural sap in them
which held them together or whether
some additional adhesive was used is
not known

  the stems as thick as a mans arm at
the base are triangular with an outer
shell or bark within is the pith this
is white and very strong it can be cut
into slices of various thicknesses as de-
sired so strong is it that boats can be
built with it moses mother jochebed
in her despair at the legally imposed
slaughter of the male children of the
hebrews put the infant moses into
what has been called an arc of bul-
rushes which was a little box made of
papyrus and set the little creature adrift
on the nile we read of larger papyrus-
built craft but this little vessel carried
a more impressive load than any of
them


amazing stories

  the area where it was cultivated was
much larger than the region it now grows
in its cutfvation may have better
deserved the name of conservation
the manufacture of papyrus for literary
work was carried on for many centuries
it is said that it is still made in syracuse

  the material is so strong and amenable
to shaping that it was often used for
mummy cases from these by careful
treatment and straightening papyri
have been recovered papyrus has also
been found in herculaneum as rolled-up
documents charred in the destruction of
the city which have been unrolled and
preserved

  the world to-day is developing a
mania for collecting fabulous prices
are paid for different objects of the
virtuosos fashion-it may be an almost
unique postage stamp or a first edi-
tion of a book of no particular literary
value and it would be quite curious if
one could make up a list of the fads
of collectors and now comes the sad
part of all this papyrus was very en-
during far more so than our modern
news-press paper and buried in ancient
ground in egypt and elsewhere there
were quantities of papyrus manuscripts
which were well worth the attention of
the world it is hard to believe that
it was not until the year  or there-
abouts that collectors of the highest
class and students of egyptology and
ancient literature including greek and
latin awoke to the fact that there
were quantities of papyri still to be had
in a good state of preservation although
centuries old they were perhaps buried
in the ruins of a building and after pres-
ervation for twenty centuries or more
were rapidly disappearing not by the
forces of nature but by the ignorance of
man thus we are told of one instance
where a number of papyri were found
by the ignorant arabs in a compact roll
and they amused themselves by burning

them on account of what they thought
was the pleasant odor which they pro-
duced and of the entire roll one was
fortunately saved

  the searching for papyri is now be-
ing systematically conducted by scientific
organizations the rather primitive in-
habitants of some of the regions where
excavations are being made have awak-
ened to the fact that papyri have a mar-
ket value and we are told of their rob-
bing the grave in a sense by carrying
on private excavations of their own in
competition with the governmental and
university investigators

  if anyone will go to a public libary
and see the condition to which the paper
on which newspapers are printed reverts
after a few years he will acquire a
great respect for papyrus

  therefore when we read of moses
and the bulrushes it is papyrus w-e
should be thinking of the plant cut up
and made into a little boat carrying the
infant who was to be the writer and ex-
ponent of the law for mankind and

effort was to make it thin the color

hair side to hair side and the lighter col-

  here a curious thing may be noted
papyrus was a definite width before be-

parchment was completely sheeted and in
single pieces from the beginning but
modern man when he makes paper first
reduces the material to the finest shreds
almost to dust wet or dry and then
felts it together to an enormous area
papyrus was made up into rolls also
sometimes of many feet in length but
never of size to compare with rolls of
paper of the present time

conclusion

the second part of the story promises to hold the readers interest to the
very end and it would be interesting to know how many will have guessed
what the conclusion of the story is to be there is a very important moral
in the narration a good bit of psychology and human nature comes out on
top for the author never lets his readers be disappointed in this regard

he is a great believer in mankind

what has gone before

  we are told of an altruistic scientist who has
discovered a serum which seems to be a cure
for the thousand natural shocks that the flesh
is heir to the serum not only removes bodily
infirmities but gives a new cast to the mind as
well as new life to the body a poor rooming
house affords him admirable subjects for his ex-
periments and the owner of a tabloid paper who
has a crippled son is deeply interested in his
work and has his son also treated the result
is amaxing a cripple is cured of his infirmities
the morale of others is changed the tabloid
expects to make a great hit when permitted to
publish the story but which for the present
is to be kept a dead secret the inventor
who is the hero of the story after all these
results which include the curing of some four-
teen hundred prisoners in farview prison in
ohio meets the president of the united states
and his cabinet we now will read of the
results of the discussion at this important
meeting what was done and the second and
concluding instalment will tell us the rest it
bids fair to hold us in suspense to the very end

gentlemen i am giving

you a secret wliich unless
something is done soon will
no longer be a secret grant
died of cancer cleveland was
operated on for cancer and i have been
treated by radium for over a year for
cancer it has been a discouraging
year a week ago my medical advisers
told me that at the most i will die in
six months at farview i saw a case

similar to mine a patient who was con-
sidered to be completely cured thirty
days after he received one dose of the
serum

  you are all sick men i am not ask-
ing you to give the diagnosis this
is going to be a gift to you and not a
cold-blooded experiment you know
what is wrong and you will know if you
are benefited i am suffering from can-
cer and i am going to ask mr biddle
to give me the first injection i am
going to have him give it to me in front
of all of you there will not be as
far as we are concerned any secrecy
after i am treated i am going to have
a dose given to my dear friend the
vice president after that the line forms
on the left you can take it or leave
it think it over talk it over come
to a decision all i ask of you is a
gentlemans promise of secrecy it will
not help the stock market to know that
i have cancer and that the vice pres-
ident has angina pectoris and may die
at any moment mr biddle will you
proceed which arm

  there was an air of resistance in the
group whisperings of disapproval and

amazing stories

ters made the average man fear the
procedure the thought of allowing an
unknown drug to be introduced into the
veins was a difficult one to face biddle
had given the serum to the president
and vice president and no one stepped
forward to be the third patient sud-
denly a little dog walked slowly up to
the table leading a blind man the dog
was a seeing friend the man goresome
the sightless leader of montana

  was there a blind man among those
convicts he asked

  there was biddle answered

  what happened to him

  i will answer that interrupted the
president i saw the man i talked
with the eye specialist who studied his
case he had perfect vision by the end
of twenty days

  that is enough replied goresome
this little guide of mine kept urging
me to move for twelve years he has
guided me and not made one mistake
i was born blind  would like to see
the sunshine before i die give me the
needle

 no man from the west has any
more courage than a new yorker ex-
claimed a senator from that state
i have been only half a man since
i had my stroke i want to be the
next man after goresome

  that started a general movement at
the end only six men remained untreated
silent critical cool determined they
refused to be swayed by the group move-
ment

  come back to washington at the end
of thirty days gentlemen concluded
the president and let us at that time
determine what is best for the nation

me minute mr president shout-
ed one of the untreated six
what does mr biddle get out of this
you answer that mr biddle whis-
pered the president

 nothing said biddle if the
serum is of any value i am willing to
give it to the nation

  why are you doing this

  i have a sick son

 have you given him the serum
have you taken it yourself

  the answer to both questions is
no

 why

  i do not care to discuss that it is
personal

 are you sure you know what the
serum will do

  no

  what do you mean by that

  i mean that i am not sure of all it will
do i only know a part of its power
be honest with us you say it makes
the blind see the criminal an honest
man it cures cancer heart disease and
every disease man can have you admit
that if it can do all that what else
can it be asked to do what other pow-
ers do you think it might have

  i do not know

  have you any suspicions

  yes but i will not say what they
are anything else 

  no you have said enough

  just one word more gentlemen
said the president if congress in the
special session passes the legislation i
will ask for mr biddle has promised
to address a joint session of the senate
and the house and at that time ex-
plain the theory of the serum and give
the formula to a selected group of sci-
entists and physicians he tells me that
it is easily and cheaply made he as-
sures me that he wishes to make a gift
of it to the nation but he feels that
its general use must be safeguarded by
wise and effective laws i want to thank
those of you who have helped me by
personally giving mr biddle a chance
to demonstrate the merits of his serum
i am not in any way blaming the six
life everlasting



gentlemen who refused to experiment
with an unknown drug good night
and good luck to all of you

chapter x

the six conspirators

the six who had refused to take
the serum that night met in a bal-
timore hotel it would be interest-
ing if it could be written into the record
that these six were powerful but corrupt
politicians that they were the recipients
of large sums from the racketeers of the
underworld that they saw in the serum
of biddle the destruction of all forms of
vice but such was not the case

  the six men were clean-cut respec-
table hard-headed business men who
considered political office simply as a
necessary adjunct to their business they
were the majority stockholders in some-
of the largest corporations in the united
states and their main interests were life
insurance accident insurance drug man-
ufacturing bonding hospitals and the
higher education of the youth of amer-
ica one of them was the president of
a large university

  the reason for the meeting was not
too much disbelief in the experiments of
biddle but too great a belief they saw
perhaps more clearly than any other six
men in america what the general use
of his serum would result in they
sat around a table with their coats off
and their shirt sleeves rolled up they
wanted to think

  the university man started the discus-
sion 

  i will imagine that i represent the
higher education not only of one uni-
versity but of the nation the income
on our endowments pays much of our
expenses that money is invested mainly
in life insurance companies and rail-
roads the railroads have been hard hit
if the life insurance companies collapse

every college in america will have to
close there would hardly be enough
money to pay the janitors let alone the
professors i am not going to do your
thinking for you but i am going to ask
each of you to imagine what effect the
general use of the biddle serum will
have on the business of the life insur-
ance companies also the companies who
are doing accident insurance

  and here is the second thing i ask
you to think about what two depart-
ments of every university are the best
attended after the plain ab or bs
groups the answer is law and medi-
cine why do our young men study
law and medicine because they expect
to make a living now one more ques-
tion suppose the biddle serum works
the way the inventor thinks it will
what will happen to the practice of
law and medicine

  i do not like to admit it but the
practice of law depends on the weak-
nesses of mens souls and the practice
of medicine depends on the weaknesses
of their bodies that must be evident
to all of us there are over one hun-
dred and twenty-five million persons in
the united states and every day mil-
lions of them break some law and have
to have the help of lawyers and every
day millions of them break some law
of health and have to appeal to the
medical profession i tell you that thirty
days after the biddle serum is given to
all of these people the income of these
two professions will cease and the law-
yers and doctors will be on the streets
selling apples and holding out the tincups
for sweet charity no one will want to
be a student of these professions our
law and medical schools will close their
doors who will want to study medi-
cine for ten years at a cost of fifteen
thousand dollars when any disease can
be cured by a single injection of a
simple serum that can be made by the


amazing stories

barrel by any manufacturing chemist
the millions invested in our hospitals
will not yield one cent of income every
drug company in america will go out
of business over night there will be
no more surgical instruments sold it
looks bad to me

  the other five remained in stolid
stodgy silence at last winston man-
ning almost cracked the spell of quiet
thinking he had been secretary of the
treasury under a former president he
was said to be one of the ten richest
men in america

  i guess that is all true at least the
conclusions are correct once the prem-
ises are granted there is another thing
that is disturbing me more than the tot-
tering of our universities

ur government is essentially one
that is ruled by the classes for
the masses it is highly political ever
since it was founded the common peo-
ple have supported it in taxes and the
rulers have lived on those taxes at
times the farmer the little laborer the
poor white-collar man have had a hard
time to get along but so far they have
not done much because they have had
no great and outstanding leadership
if they had the right kind of leaders
they would tear the present political
machinery to pieces and out of the ruins
they would build a government that was
sympathetic with the under man the
forgotten man who does little except
work like a dog live as best he can and
pay taxes

  keep that in mind for the time
forget the cases of cancer and blindness
and kidney disease that are said to
have been cured by the biddle serum
think what it has done to the souls of
the people who have taken that serum
think of the changes it has made in
their personality take the case of the
taxi dancer in new york city of

course the purple flash did not give
her right name but i am sure the facts
concerning her are absolutely true then
consider the reports of the psychologists
and sociologists who studied those four-
teen hundred convicts in farview prison
take the simple statement of the hard-
boiled warden take the strong words
he gave to the press  have known
many of these men for years since the
giving of the serum they have changed so
for the better that i would trust any of
them in any way i am seriously con-
sidering approaching the governor of
ohio with the suggestion that these men
be released from prison and given one
more chance to rehabilitate themselves
does it not seem that in some way this
serum enables men to think more clearly
to live more cleanly to follow more ac-
curately the teaching of the golden
rule

  to-day you saw over a hundred of
the leading politicians in the united
states step up and take that serum
i know those men you know them
outside of welfare watkins who is
an emotional idealistic asinine sort of
a person i would not trust one of that
bunch with a five-cent piece they would
take the pennies from a dead mans eyes
and rob a starving infant of his bottle
of milk they have had charge of the
government cow for years and they
have milked that cow dry they know
every trick to deceive and rob the public
and in their way they are as criminal
as the men of farview ever dreamed
of being only they were too smart to be
caught

  they took the serum the president
was smart he wants to come up for
another term he thinks that if he
gives the populace free health they will
vote for him he never said a word
to those men about curing their souls
but he was very anxious to give them
healthy bodies so they could repay him
life everlasting



with their gratitude perhaps they will
he may have overlooked what the
damned drug would do to their souls
but i tell you this if the serum works
on those politicians in the same way it
worked on those criminals they will
come back to congress representing the
common people and having the interests
of the forgotten man at heart and at the
next election both the democratic and
the republican party will be killed and
the country will cease to have a political
rule but will be governed solely in the
interests of the people and that will
mean the death of every large corpora-
tion in america laugh about that if
you can

  again the sextette remained silent
at last a bishop broke the silence he
was a combination of priest and politi-
cian and once had swayed a national
election by an appeal to religious preju-
dice

  biddle knows more about this serum
than he is telling the clergyman whis-
pered you have talked about the fall
of universities and of political parties
but there is something more serious
suppose he is right in his claim of being
able to cure the bodies of mankind
suppose the sick become well and the
well stay well how are people going
to die are they going to die what
is going to happen if they dont die
every religion in the world is based on
the fear and hope of eternity the fear
of hell and the hope of paradise but
how can there be a future if there is
no end to the present

  our religious life will smash our
churches close the contributions to the
support of the clergy come to an end

  you take it too seriously bishop
laughed the university president biddle
never said he could give the people im-
mortality he does not think so and
no one else thinks so

  i know he did not say so argued

the bishop but he did say that he was
not sure of just what power the serum
held even suppose that death does
come his serum robs the world of
sin and i cannot see how the church
would function were it not for sin i
understand his subconscious thought
and it is one i have had to combat for
years the idea that there is no sin only
disease and that all crimes are simply
symptoms of an abnormal body or mind
-that if the disease could be discovered
and cured the symptoms would disap-
pear and the patient would cease to be
a criminal i have had an army physi-
cian argue that a cocaine fiend was sim-
ply a sick man just like a victim of
typhoid fever now if all wickedness
in the world can be done away with just
by giving every person a dose of the
biddle serum what is going to be the
future of my church and every other
church 

t is growing late growled one of
the men what is the answer
we cannot get anywhere by talking
about the immortality of the soul and
the philosophy of crime and religion
what are we going to do about it
we have to see biddle and buy the
secret of the serum from him de-
manded the bishop

  suppose he wont sell

  he will if we find out his price
  but he may be honest

  then there is only one thing to do
sighed the university professor we
will talk to him kindly we will show
him where he is wrong we will per-
suade him that the best thing is to form
a company for the manufacture and dis-
tribution of the drug we will tell him
that he can be president of the com-
pany tell him anything pay him
anything he asks money power rep-
utation a trip to europe to demonstrate
the drug


amazing stories

  we will do that little thing if he
refuses to listen to us we will have to
take him out for a ride

  why professor exclaimed the pol-
itician

  and continued the president of a
noted university congress can then
meet the blind goresome may see our
beloved president may be cured of his
cancer they will wait but they will
wait in vain for the arrival of biddle
the philanthropic inventor of the cureall
serum there will be a lot of talk and
then the people will laugh and call it
one of the greatest bluffs of the age and
say that barnum died too soon but left
worthy followers in welfare jones and
our great president

  and that was the final decision of the
six conspirators

chapter xi

fate intervenes

the six lost no time in making
contact it was thought best to
have the negotiations opened by
the bishop he went to philadelphia
located biddle and called on him in his
laboratory his name his position in
society made the door to the scientists
office open rather easily in spite of the
fact that the man and every move he
made was carefully guarded by secret
service men the president did not
want anything to happen to the maker
of the serum

  the bishop thought he knew his man
he had an idea that honesty would be
the best policy at least sufficient hon-
esty to convince his listener that he was
honest so without loss of a second
he opened the conversation

  mr biddle i represent five other
men besides myself when i name
those five you will recognize them as be-
ing leaders in everything that is tra-
ditionally great in america they stand

for culture education stability and the
best things of life we have met
and given serious consideration to your
discovery we believe in you and the
value of your serum but we are not
convinced that the plan of the president
of the united states is the wisest and
best one to our mind there are sev-
eral objections as i understand it you
propose to make this medicine available
to every one rich and poor wise and
ignorant irrespective of color am i
right 

  i really do not know it may be
that there will be some restrictions that
is up to congress

  would it not be better to -have at
least an educational limit you are giv-
ing unlimited health to the world would
it be wise to give it to all should it
not be limited to those who can use and
appreciate such a blessing

  you think that to those who have shall
be given and those who have little shall
lose their all

  not exactly

  then what do you think

  just this the man who receives
your serum will be endowed with won-
derful health he will have a great
advantage over his fellows now to use
that advantage to the greatest good he
should have a corresponding intelligence
be of a good family have a background
of culture your experiment with the
criminals was all right as an experi-
ment but we cannot approve of it as
routine practice do you intend to re-
store healthy bodies to the underworld
the insane the mentally defective and
turn them loose on society to continue to
be a burden and an additional one be-
cause of their vigorous bodies

 t hoped that there would be a
  change in their minds

  that is impossible can a leopard
change his spots
life everlasting



  perhaps not at least even with liis
spots he will be a happier leopard if he
is a healthy one

  all right but how about europe
asia those nations owe us millions
even billions of dollars are you going
to give them universal health i feel
that they are waiting for the time to
come when they can crush us if you
make a public announcement of the
formula every country in europe will
start making the serum at once

  it will be a fine thing for their sick
oh i admit that but think of our
country would it not be better to keep
the formula a secret and sell them the
drug if you do not want to profit let
a corporation be formed with a large
percentage of profits going to the gov-
ernment that would lower taxes and
at the same time keep the secret as a
national possession would you do
that

  no

  will you sell it to us

  no

  what is your price 

  i have none

  what do you want wealth pow-
er fame office name it we
are in a position to give you anything
you ask for if you go in with us

  i do not want anything

  one more question why did you
want to make a serum like this

  i have a son

  have you given him the serum
no now bishop i feel that we
understand each other my time is val-
uable will you excuse me

  five hundred million 

  go if you do not i will have to
have you removed

  the bishop left

biddle sat down and in long hand
wrote a confidential report of the
entire conversation and sent it to the

president he felt it was important so
did the president

  the bishop went back to the pow-
erful five

  i know a man said the politician
who can do this little thing for us
he takes pride in his special abilities of
course his price for biddle would be
high the inventor has become a na-
tional personage but this man would
do it for a million

  put him to work said the bishop
i hope he has better luck than i had
that night a sleek little man nicely
dressed and carefully manicured called
by invitation to see a powerful poli-
tician he listened to the mans story

  a million is a lot of cash he at
last commented and this guy biddle is
worth it and maybe more it can be
done but i do not want to take all the
grief who is back of this

  do you have to know

  i should i want to feel sure that
they have power enough to take care of
me the matter need not be talked
about just have a supper in a quiet
place and invite me i know most of
the big guys and then after i have a
chance to look them over i will give
you my answer and my price

  i am not sure they would come
  then i am sure i wont do it

  ill see them

  better make it to-night and get a
quiet place and a back room how
about meeting at tonys place down on
the avenue he is a friend of mine
and knows how to keep him mouth shut
ten to-night and the six of you had
better be there

  seven men sat around a small table
at tonys place that night six of
them ate little and talked less the
sleek little man ate and talked for the
rest at last he wiped his mouth

  you want me to take this man bid-
dle for a ride


amazing stories

  something like that whispered the
politician

  how about two million

  we will pay it in coin said the
university president no bank notes
and no checks and no publicity

  o k with me but with your ed-
ucation you ought to know that two
million in coin is a lot of metal you
had better arrange to give it to me in
negotiable government bonds suppose
one of you meets me here to-morrow
night with them ill be going now i
dont want to be seen leaving here with
you i have a reputation to preserve
he went out of the room ten min-
utes later the six men left tonys
place on the sidewalk they were
greeted by a blast of machine bullets
they were dead before they knew what
had happened to them dead before the
auto with the closed curtains was a
block away

chapter xii

biddle has a caller

two days after this biddle had a
visitor none other than the
president of the united states
he came without notice and so secre
that his arrival in philadelphia did not
receive the attention of the papers un-
til he was ready to return to washing-
ton he asked for a private interview
with the inventor

  i received your letter he said to the
scientist in a way i was not surprised
those six men have been persistent in
their efforts to block every effort of
mine to have legislation passed that
would in any way be of benefit to the
people they were intelligent and felt
that they had a sacred trust and that
was the preservation of special inter-
ests they felt that in some way the
general use of your serum would be in-
jurious to the various corporations they

represented in refusing to take the
serum themselves they paid you a high
compliment they evidently wanted to
go the limit in blocking any plan leading
to its general use have you seen the
papers 

  i have not seen a paper for four
days i have been busy working out my
plans for the manufacture of the serum
in bulk

  then you do not know what hap-
pened to the six

  oh that yes i heard about it
did you have anything to do with
it i know that is a hard question for
you to answer but i must know their
antagonism to my future plans must be
known and their being killed in front of
a new york speakeasy has already
raised all kinds of gossip i feel that
the administration can weather the
storm but i should like to know the
facts would you mind giving them to
me 

  you do not think i killed them
no you do not impress me as a
gangster and the crime was that kind
of a murder but you had every rea-
son to fear them and i feel sure they
intended some harm to you probably
not murder but certainly kidnapping or
blackmail as soon as i received your
letter i made arrangements for your
protection but evidently it was not
necessary 

  no it was all taken care of

  do you know how it was done
who did it

  yes but just within the last two
hours in fact i just said good-bye to
the source of my information about
thirty minutes before you arrived my
visitor was none other than silent sin-
cox perhaps you have heard of him
he is a rather powerful force in the
various rackets of new york he came
to see me

  life mr president is a rather
life everlasting



peculiar thing millions of people act-
ing and interacting and reacting on each
other millions who are swayed this
way and that way by the tides of life
with no clear perception of where they
are going or why they are going or
why they are doing what they are doing

  something of all this happened in
regard to our six leaders when they
found they could not bribe me they de-
cided to kill me i suppose they had
the right idea and i am not sure tliat
we can blame them they were a little
careful in the way they went at it at
least they secured the services of a man
who was never known to double-cross a
customer and who never failed to earn
the price of taking a man for a ride
he was so clever that the police so far
have absolutely failed to pin a single
murder on him of all the killers in
america they could not have selected one
who was more to be trusted in a matter
like that

  but silent sincox did not come from
italy he came from shamokin pa
and his right name was peter casey
he had a sister he loved dearly her
name was mary he tried to make her
behave but he made a failure of it she
came to new york changed her name to
valencia moore and was one of my first
cases the serum made a rather re-
markable change in her morals the
case was one of those detailed in the
purple flash but the name was changed
of course the brother knew of the
change he knew that in some way i
was the one who was responsible for it
rather a coincidence was it not

vtou would think that was enough

     but it was not the only odd feature
of this story silent sincox had a friend
a boy he had known since childhood
the friend committed murder was
caught redhanded and sentenced to life
imprisonment in farview prison sin-

cox used to go and visit him he was
dying from tuberculosis death was
just around the corner he was one
of the convicts who received the first
injection sincox knew about that he
was not sure of my name but he made
it his business to do something for me
he told me that his first thought was to
buy me a diamond ring that was co-
incidence number two

  now of all the killers in america
these six men had to go to this man
and ask him to kill a person by the
name of biddle he knew there was
more than one biddle so he did a lit-
tle stalling and learned that the specific
biddle he was being hired to kill was
the man who had reformed his sister
and cured his friend he arranged mat-
ters met the six men walked out of the
speak-easy ahead of them gave the sig-
nal to his helpers and that was all there
was to it there was no way at all to
show that he was at all connected with
the murder he paid all the expenses
and the men who did it are now on
their way to italy in a private seaplane

  but he felt that i ought to know
about it if some men wanted to kill
me there might be others he wanted
me to be on my guard so he called on
me and told me the story he will
never kill another man

 how do you know

  i gave him a dose of serum just be-
fore he left

the presidents message

the senate chamber was filled
with senators and representa-
tatives the visitors galleries
were jammed with the aristocracy of
america and ambassadors and minis-
ters from foreign lands the press-
boxes were filled to overflowing the
president personally was going to open


amazing

stories

the special session of congress and read
his message

 the chamber rocked with applause
as he walked in followed by his cab-
inet and governors from over three-
quarters of the states when the ap-
plause died away to silence he began to
read

 to the senators and representatives
of the congress of the united states

  have asked you to meet in spe-
cial session to consider a matter of
vital importance to the interests and
welfare of every citizen of this
country

   at a time when the economic
 foundations of our country are being
 shaken when the deficit is growing
 and in spite of all our efforts to
 balance the budget the nation is rap-
 idly falling in bankruptcy and no
 system of taxation appears possible
 new hope is given us by a scientific
 discovery that may be of such
 value that it will revive our entire
 economy and make us again a
 prosperous and happy people

    i refer as you probably know
 to the discovery of a serum by a
 scientist named biddle this serum
 has been given to five persons in
 new york city to over fourteen
 hundred convicts in farview prison
 ohio and lastly to over one hun-
 dred of the leading officials of this
 county including your president
 and vice president

    in every case the giving of the
 serum has been attended with
 changes so decisive so far reach-
 ing in the healing of disease and the
 recovery of the patient that the
 medical experts feel that a new
 force has been isolated which will
 revolutionize the life of the human
 race

   for several decades the com-
 monwealths of our country have

been increasingly burdened with the
care of the abnormal the care of
the insane the mentally deficient
the epileptic the criminal the psych-
opathic personalities has become one
of the main costs of our national
life

   in addition there has been an in-
creasing demand that the states
or the nations care for the tubercu-
lous the cancer cases and other
forms of incurable disease add to
all this the hospitalization of our ex-
service men and the entire country
is loaded to the saturation point
simply with discharging its respon-
sibility to its sick and disabled
citizens

  crime also adds to the cost of
government remove crime and
you lessen the work of our judiciary
to a minus point and also empty our
prisons

  the general use of the biddle
serum promises all this and more to
our nation mr biddle has offered
it as a gift to the country if we can
assure him that it will be wisely and
properly used he feels that its use
should be available to everyone in
this country irrespective of race
wealth or social position

  i have therefore prepared a law
to be known as the serum bill i
am asking you to pass this law with
such amendments as you see fit if
you can assure mr biddle that the
main features of the law as we have
framed them will be preserved he
has promised to address you at
once and give to the representatives
of the medical profession who have
met writh us at my invitation the
formula of his serum full direc-
tions as to its use and his opinion
as to just what benefits the country
will derive from his gift
life everlasting



  his message delivered the president
turned and sat down instead of ap-
plause there was a buzz of conversa-
tion the vice president rapped for
order and said

  i am going to call on senator gore-
some of montana

  down the crowded center aisle walked
a little dog leading a man the sight was
a familiar one for years the blind
senator had been led by his faithful
dog reaching the rostrum the dog sat
down and looked up at his master and
friend the man turned bent over and
patted the animal on the head the
dog wagged his tail

y friends began the montana
senator we have all re-
ceived printed copies of the legislation
called the serum bill which the pres-
ident asks us to consider and if we see
fit to make it a law we have read the
bill and approve of it i have been in
conference with the leaders of both re-
publican and democratic parties and
they assure me that action will be
taken as rapidly as is consistent with
the rules of our respective bodies mr
biddle need have no doubt as to our in-
tentions in this matter both the house
and senate pledge themselves to sup-
port this legislation

  now i wish to say something that is
purely personal i was born blind for
the last twelve years my little dog has
led me through the dangers of this
world and has led me safely we have
become inseparable friends i think that
if he discovered that he was no longer a
necessity in my life he would die of
grief some weeks ago i received an
injection of the biddle serum i re-
covered my sight and now have perfect
vision it may have been a coincidence
but i feel that the serum gave me some-
thing i was sure i could never have
but in gaining my sight i saw that i

might cause my little friend much suffer-
ing he is growing old and will soon
die for the little while he lives i am
going to pretend i am still blind just
to make a little dog happy

  mr biddle a man who was once
blind but who can now see wishes to
thank you for his sight the world
he now sees appears to be a very beau-
tiful one when i realize that the same
gift i received can become the heritage
of every blind person in the united
states i am filled with awe and won-
der sir you are but a human being
but in your invention of this serum you
have been inspired by a power that is
divine

  in your future you will receive due
praise for your work your name will
go down in the history of the nation as
one of its greatest benefactors but i
cannot wait for the future i wish to
take this opportunity of voicing the
thought of a nation that has not yet
awakened to the gift you have given
them in the name of every man woman
and child every one who is sick or
afflicted i thank you if at any future
time a grateful nation can do anything
for you mr biddle all you have to do
is to come to this chamber and ask it
for help again a blind man who can
see thanks you for the blessing of that
sight

  he turned to walk back to his seat
the little dog leading him there may
have been an uneasy murmur when the
president finished his message but now
there was wild applause the legisla-
tures the audience the press rose and
gave to an individual the greatest per-
sonal tribute that the senate chamber
had ever seen goresome and his little
dog and his simple speech had touched
the human heart more than any flight of
oratory could ever have done the au-
dience was cheering biddle the inven-
tor of the serum but they were also


amazing stories

adding their tribute to the great leader
who could in his moment of happiness
think of the happiness of his little dog

 biddle stood up and bowed in re-
sponse to the insistent clamor of the
cheering throng he went over to
goresome and took his hand just that
and not a word from either of them just
a handshake

       chapter xiv
       biddle explains

an hour later the scientist met twelve
a physicians in the presidents
  office at the white house the
president was there a stenographer and
one representative of the press

 the physicians had been carefully
selected by the american medical asso-
ciation each was a specialist and one
was in addition to being a physician a
noted chemist after introductions bid-
dle began his explanation of the serum
he talked at length concerning the one
celled animal showed how man was
simply a collection of such cells he
called their attention to the fact that
under favorable circumstances the
isolated cell could live indefinitely
whereas in large masses as in the body
of a man they rapidly died could not
reproduce starved from lack of proper
nourishment and ultimately produced
such a poisoning of the system that the
entire mass died

  he explained that his thought years
ago had been to improve the circulation
in such a way that the individual cell
would live longer later he found that
within the cell was a mass of energy
capable of providing life indefinitely if
it could be liberated he was not sure
what this energy was it might be some
form of radiant vibration it might be
energy obtained from the splitting qf the
hydrogen atom he had worked for
some years on the probleril of the re-

lease of this energy and had finally
solved it even in the solution he was
very much in the dark he simply knew
that the injection of a certain serum or
solution of chemicals gave an extra
function to the individual cell and en-
abled it to release this energy just as
well when it was in combination with
millions of cells of the human body as
it could when it was isolated and de-
tached from all others

  even there he was in doubt as to
whether he was simply restoring a lost
power to the cell or giving it a new
power

  he had experimented with this solu-
tion on many forms of multicellular life
in all instances the effect was the same
it made a sick plant or animal well five
years ago he had started to experiment
with sick mammals and had cured vari-
ous diseases his work with the higher
apes had been most interesting at last
he had felt justified in beginning his
work with the human animal the re-
sults had been identical with those he
had seen in the lower types of animal
life

  it was more and more clear to him
he explained that all conduct that was
selfish and anti-social was simply the
result of sickness he hoped that future
work with the serum would make this
thought a definite scientific fact if it
were true then all sin and evil in the
world could be wiped out and man
following the golden rule would leap
upward toward the stars

  in his work with animals he felt that
he had been able to prolong life that
would have to be considered at pres-
ent all that could be said was that the
expectancy of life would be increased
how much would be added to the span
of human existence would have to be
determined by years of observation the
question of a second dose would also
have to be experimented with person-
life everlasting



ally he felt that the maximum result
would be obtained from one dose of
ten cubic centimeters

  he hoped that there would be an im-
provement in the intelligence of the
nation he was sure there would be
some advance certain of the convicts
had shown a remarkable increase in their
intellectual quotient that result also
would have to be studied

  but even if nothing more resulted than
the improvement of the physical health
of the nation it would be worth while
he advised that the serum be made in at
least a dozen laboratories and distributed
free to every reputable physician he
understood that the serum bill would
provide for pensioning the medical pro-
fession in return for their services they
would need some pension as when the
entire population was treated there
would be little or no work for either
physician or surgeon except in accident
cases even in severe accidents a dose
of the serum would perhaps cure with-
out an operation

  he ended by giving the compostion of
the serum and the manner of its prep-
aration it was not a true serum but
rather a watery compond of certain well
known chemicals he had called it a
serum because that name was best ap-
preciated by the laity when he fin-
ished he asked the chemist if he
understood and would be able to make it

 understand make it asked the
chemist why it is so simple that
anyone could follow the directions and
make it it is too simple i wonder
why no one thought of it before

 columbus and the egg re-
marked the president and now
gentlemen have any of you any ques-
tions to ask mr biddle he is very
anxious to leave the city

  how about the diet asked one of
the doctors

  anything at all but the person will
eat less and less food and drink more and
more water he may use the hydrogen
atom in the water i am not sure

  i think said the president of the
a m a that i have never met a
man who knew more about a thing and
was less sure of that knowledge at
the same time it is not necessary to
know how the drug works so long as
we are sure of the fact that it does i
feel that mr biddle has done his share
it is now our duty as members of the
greatest most self-sacrificing profession
in the world to begin the work that will
ultimately make us all hunt another job
you are not sure mr biddle how much
life will be prolonged

  i cannot answer that certainly
some years

  do you think there is a cliance that
after a person lives a long time he may
gain the impression that he cannot die
i do not know

  have any of the animals you have
experimented with died

  none of them have died a natural
death of course i killed a number
of them for microscopic study

  have you considered the great in-
crease in population if the span of life is
greatly prolonged

  yes but i do not think we need
worry about it wealth will greatly in-
crease life will be easier happier the
healthy man will find new methods of
socialization in addition to all this
there will be a decrease in the birth
rate

   what makes you think so

  i do not know i just feel so per-
haps man will be wiser

  you evidently do not want to dis-
cuss this point why not

  because i know so little about it
have you anything to tell us to
advise us


amazing stories

ves i would first concentrate on
the abnormals those who are def-
inite charges on the state emptying
the hospitals and then see to it that
every citizen of the united states re-
ceives his dose you will have to be
careful of the criminal class they will
probably try to escape there is one
thing in which i think the medical pro-
fession should go on record in regard
to the prisoners we should feel that
every so-called bad man and bad wom-
an was a sick man and sick woman
once they have recovered from that
sickness they should be given liberty
you know my argument the legal
profession the penologists must accept
it in fact i had it written into the
serum law but you must educate the
public to the point where they will be
willing to follow out that provision
and with that he prepared to leave
the room he went into the presidents
private office for a last word

  i forgot to ask you but perhaps it
was not necessary how is your throat 
the cancer

  cured at least that is what my
specialists tell me

  good that is fine

  just then one of the private secre-
taries came into the office

  the english ambassador is here he
is demanding an interview with the
president and mr biddle

  you know what he wants biddle
asked the president

  certainly he wants the formula
so he can send it over to his country
he is just the first to ask for it in
the next twenty-four hours the world
will be knocking at your door

  i have been afraid of that how
would it be to effect a compromise
tell them they can have the secret if
they promise to disarm and sign a
treaty of everlasting peace

  biddle smiled it was a rather timid
frightened smile

  i do not think that will be neces-
sary i think we should tell them how-
to make it and advise them to give it
to their entire population if the serum
works the way i think it will work there
will never be any more wars treaties or
no treaties after all war is simply na-
tional insanity and a form of sickness
the serum ought to help i believe it
will of course it is a big idea mr
president and it is so big i am afraid
of it but i would advise you to talk
frankly with the various ambassadors
and give them the formula without re-
strictions and now i must be going
wont you stay for supper i should
like to give some of my friends a chance
to meet you

  no my work here is over i have
a son i want to go and see him

chapter xv

the school for unusual children

the mary gregory school for un-
usual children was one of the first
of its kind in america the super-
rich in the past had built libraries
endowed museums financed founda-
tions for the eradication of disease and
had even built monuments to their fam-
ily fame in the form of wide roads
across an entire state

 but mary gregory left more mil-
lions by her family than she or any
other woman would know what to do
with built a school to care for fifteen
hundred unusual children and after it
was built and completely furnished she
employed the best personnel in the coun-
try to go there and work and set aside an
endowment sufficient to provide a thou-
sand dollars income for each child per
year then and only then she gave
the entire school to the state of maine
when she was criticized for giving it to
life everlasting



maine rather than to new york she
simply smiled and said she felt that the
children of maine needed it

  at the head of the schood she placed
a man who for years had worked with
the abnormal child for twenty years
he had studied them cared for them
laughed and cried with them and had
tried to make them happy he was a
great man who in his simplicity be-
lieved that after another twenty years
of study he would begin to understand
how to care for the unusual child

  dr bonchields motto for the entire
school was happiness first he be-
lieved that if the children were happy
the other essentials of life would be
supplied them easily provided of
course there was money and intelli-
gence

  slowly fifteen hundred children were
admitted to this school they were all
mentally deficient of all grades from
the lowest idiot to the highest moron
but each child irrespective of his in-
tellectual quotient was to be given an
opportunity to advance to the limit of
his ability they were to be given aca-
demic education occupational therapy
moral instruction athletic diversion and
emotional outlet

  when biddle left washington he went
directly to this school there he met
by appointment mary gregory and dr
bonchield both of them knew him
as he made occasional visits to the
school mary gregory was growing
old but was still alert mentally

  it appears she said as she greeted
biddle that you have become a per-
sonage of international renown

  the scientist smiled

  it seems that way and that was
the last thing i wanted but certain
things had to be done and in my doing
them people had to find out who i was
now that it is all over i want nothing
more than to sink back into obscurity

i have a little work to do here and
then i intend to go to canada i have
a little country place up there that i
believe is safe from reporters

  up here in maine interrupted dr
bonchield we are very much in the
backwaters of life of course we read
the newspapers miss gregory and i
have been talking about it trying to
decide what it all means is it your
thought that the serum will actually
change our civilization or is that just
the dream of the newspapers

  i do not believe that anyone knows
just what it will do was the scien-
tists serious reply we are too close
to it i feel that it will take twenty-five
years at least before the final results
can be analyzed but there is no doubt
that it will improve the health of the na-
tion lower the tax rate and i hope in-
crease the happiness of the individual
mary gregory sighed

  we received your letter and we
have given it serious thought of
course we are going to help you to give
our children the serum it is impossible
for us to refuse but we feel that we
know more about these children than
you do and we feel that we should
warn you not to be overconfident of
the results you explain how we look
at it doctor bonchield

t seems to us said the doctor
taking up the thread of the conver-
sation that you should realize that
mental deficiency is not a disease but
a condition not a unity but a scrap-
basket it arises from many causes
some cases are hereditary but feeble-
mindedness can occur as a symptom of
a number of other diseases and surgi-
cal conditions in many instances the
brain is so damaged that the intelligence
is completely destroyed we feel that
there may be an improvement in the
general health of the children follow-


amazing stories

mg the injection of your serum but
there will not be any noticeable change
in their deficiency they will remain
feeble minded

  you may be right admitted the
scientist you certainly know a great
deal more about it than i do mental de-
fect was something i could not ex-
periment with in the lower forms of
life some of the convicts were rather
low but there were not enough of them
to make any definite conclusion pos-
sible all we can do is to give the serum
and wait thirty days i know that the
maximum results will be reached in that
time i feel sure your own physicians
will be able to do the work there has
been so much notoriety that i hesitated
asking you to secure additional help
of course there was another reason
you mean the boy asked mary
gregory

  yes you see i have been con-
siderably worried about him the en-
tire work was done with him in mind i
have tried to keep him in the background
as much as possible now that i can
be a little selfish and devote some time
to my personal problems i do not want
the matter a subject of world gos-
sip how is the boy

  as well as can be expected you
know how those mongolian cases are
low vitality poor resistance to infection
always getting scratches and colds
you have no idea of the cause of
mongolianism 

  no nothing new it just hap-
pens

  biddle stood up placed a suitcase
oil the desk and opened it

  i brought the serum along with me
some of my own make i wanted to be
sure of it if you are ready suppose
you call in the staff explain matters to
them and start with the injections
may i watch asked mary gregory

  certainly you should be very much
interested

  i am fifteen million dollars worth
you realize what this will do to the
school if it is successful i shall have
to find some other use for it of course
some of the children will have to be
cared for anyway they have no families
but if these children are given normal
minds by your serum the mary gregory
school for unusual children will be
simply a historical memory

  and i added dr bonchield will
be a man without a job

  i will take care of you said mary
gregory if you will let me do it are
you going to give us the serum mr
biddle

  if you want me to i thought we
might as w-ell give it to you and the
staff so they can observe my exact tech-
nique

  do you want to take care of your
little boy yourself

  no i have rather definite plans
for him i want you to give all of your
patients the serum then wait thirty
days if at the end of that time you
feel that it is curative if you are
pleased with the results then give the
regular dose to my boy i am going
up to canada to rest and think in
sixty days i will be back for the boy

i am thinking of a trip to europe with
him if he is well he will enjoy that
how old is he now doctor

  nearly twelve

  just right to be a dandy companion
on a walking trip through the black
forest lets get started you know
my plan just wait thirty days and
then if the other little boys and girls
are helped as much as i hope they will
be give him his serum

  why not give it now mr biddle
asked the doctor

  because he is my son i have to be
sure all this work was done to restore
life everlasting



him to normal mental health if i give
it to him and there are no results life
will not mean very much to me i
promised his mother before she died
that i would try to help him there
must be no failure i must be sure i
shall be able to pass the sixty days very
nicely i have a lot to work over in
my mind i know you people and i
trust you to make a correct decision
will you give us your address
asked the doctor

  no i am giving that to no one
but i will be back in exactly thirty
days after you give the boy his injection
sixty days from to-day and now miss
gregory will you let me give you the
medicine 

sixty days later the scientist walked
unannounced into dr bonchields
office

  well doctor how are the children
he asked

  the specialist looked up

  oh it is you mr biddle the
the children why they are all well
in fact the children are very well
did the serum work

  something did our boys and girls
are normal physically and mentally
the lame are walking the blind seeing
the dumb talking the idiots are learn-
ing to read and write you never saw
a healthier happier more intelligent lot
of young people

  thats fine hurry and get the boy
ready i want to go right back to que-
bec and take the next boat for france
your boy oh i forgot you
see we did not know where you were
so there was nothing to do no wayto
let you know

  didnt the serum help him 

  he never received it we had ar-
ranged to give it on the thirtieth day
according to your orders  the night
before he went into coma and in a few

minutes he was gone i saw him as

soon as i could but it was too late
do you mean he is dead asked the
puzzled scientist

  yes i am terribly sorry

  and you did not give him the
serum 

  no you see he was dead before i
could get to him

  i wish you had given it to him any-
way

  but i didnt know- you surely do
not mean that the drug brings the dead
back to life- not that mr biddle
surely not that

  i dont know perhaps it would
have done no good

  i am sorry

  that is all right but i wish you
had given it to him anyway even if he
was dead even though it would not have
helped him perhaps in some way he
would have known about it known that
i had not forgotten him known that i
wanted him to have his chance like the
rest of the children perhaps his
mother can explain it to him

  will you stay awhile with us see
the children

  no replied mr biddle ill be
going back to my place in canada you
see i have a lot of things to think
about now

chapter xvi

life is different

the biddle serum bill passed by
congress in record time provided
that every man woman and child
in the united states should receive free
of charge one dose of the serum
where possible to do so preference
should be given to the sick and aged
and the little children after that
everyone should be cared for

  it was anticipated that there would
be resistance from the antivivisectionists


amazing stories

and certain religious organizations this
opposition was provided for in the bill
no one had to take the serum but no one
could refuse and continue residence in
the united states it was believed that
the greatest benefit could not be derived
from the drug if a residue of the pop-
ulation remained capable of contracting
disease becoming insane or remaining
social menaces

  there was therefore an exodus of
conscientious objectors from the states
most of these were good citizens but
poor logicians in addition a large
number of the underworld made every
effort to escape the effect of the purify-
ing drug they fared rather well once
across the mexican border but those
who tried the canadian route fared
badly once caught and identified they
were injected with the biddle serum and
sent back to the states better men in
spite of themselves for canada in
close spiritual sympathy with the united
states had not neglected to avail her-
self of this new medical gift

the actual giving of the serum was
done by the members of the medical
profession as rapidly as they were sup-
plied with the serum the one hundred
and eighty thousand physicians and sur-
geons in the country started their cam-
paign once it was made universally
available the demand for the drug in-
creased daiy long lines of rich and
poor stood in front of the office of every
physician not only the sick but also the
well not only the miserable but those
fairly happy who wished to stay happy
children brought their aged parents
parents brought their little children no
longer the question ivould it
work was asked but the questions
how soonr and for how
long

  to the tens and hundreds of thou-
sands of hopeless cases in hospitals

asylums and prisons the future that
opened was such a startling change
that there was of necessity a rather
difficult period of readjustment those
who had been insane for years recovered
perfect health and sanity- only to find
their families dead scattered or lost
men discharged from prison after years
of servitude found their wives remar-
ried and their children almost strangers
to them but these were minor inci-
dents fortunately the rejuvenates re-
entered a friendly kindly world where
the question was how can i help
you rather than how much can
you pay for my services

  for the people of the united states
were growing richer and happier every
day they were free from the need of
supporting the sick the indigent the
crippled the abnormal the epileptic the
insane the criminal and the psychopath
there was neither drunkenness nor drug
addiction the courts closed for lack
of work the police force of every dty
was decimated clear-eyed steady-
handed free from sickness the laborer
was able to perform more work and
was willing to

  there had always been enough wealth
in the united states now with the
political leaders taking every opportu-
nity to secure an equal distribution of
the necessities of life to every one
poverty ceased to exist it cost less to
live there was a gradual decrease in
food consumption hunger became un-
known work became joyous amuse-
ments pleasurable and sleep a pleasant
pastime

  while large masses of industries
ceased to exist those who were thrown
out of work had no difficulty in finding
other fields of activity

  the working day shortened the
dollar was more easily earned and was
constantly increased in buying value
everyone had something to do every-
life everlasting



one received a living wage for doing it
and all had lots of time for recreation

  before the end of eighteen months
the president was able to announce that
over ninety-nine percent of the populace
had been injected then began a con-
certed drive to force the remaining one
percent to fall into line and to receive
their serum the work now was con-
siderably slower but at the end of the
second year it was thought that every-
one in the united states had been pro-
tected against disease

the biddle serum bill provided for
a committee of scientists who were
to make constant observations on the
efficacy of the new drug and from time
to time were to report to the president
of the united states and his cabinet
concerning the changes resulting in the
social economic and hygienic life of the
people it was provided in the bill
that the first report be made one year
after the serum had been given to every-
one thus the first report was made
three years following the giving of the
first serum after the passage of the
bill

  biddle was supposed to be a member
of that committee but biddle had dis-
appeared no one had the remotest idea
of where he was certain questions
would have been asked him had it been
possible to do so the thinkers of the
nation were beginning to wonder other
factors were forcing their way into the
mental life of the nation results of the
serum that no one had foreseen clearly
during the months when the nation had
become free from disease these prob-
lems had to be faced

  in the first place the death rate had
dropped to a vanishing point except
in cases of destructive accident people
had ceased to die the senile had re-
juvenated to a healthy middle age the
young appeared to grow no older and

the infants and adolescents simply con-
tinued to make the normal growth for
their age but no one died

  that fact in itself was not a cause
for instant alarm it was considered
that finally the effect of the serum would
wear out and that death again would
appear as a friendly enemy of the
human race perhaps old age could be
deferred by repeated doses of the serum
but eventually the human organism
would wear out and man would die
maybe of no special disease but simply
from a weariness of life

  but the thing that was startling and
a little difficult to explain was the fact
that the birth rate was as rapidly
diminishing as was the death rate for
a while after the giving of the serum
babies had been born but as the months
passed there were fewer of them and
from the thirty-third to the thirty-sixth
month of the experiment there was not
a single birth reported in the entire
united states there were still lots of
little children growing up beautiful
little bronzed darlings learning to walk
and talk and do things but there were
no additional babies

  what did it mean was the cessation
of death to be compensated for by the
cessation of new life had biddle
known this

  the third factor that was causing in-
terest was the increasing efforts of the
human race to entertain itself the
long hours of leisure had to be filled in
some way healthy vigorous active
men refused to become idlers simply
because they were not driven to effort
by the spur of necessity the dominance
of production by machine power was
beginning to pall mankind began to
use their hands

social life became fuller and physi-
cally richer with the increase of
health and wealth and leisure there came

greater opportunities for marriage it
was no longer necessary to wait till
a man was thirty or more for him to
marry fewer women worked and more
devoted themselves to the cultivation of
happiness a life free of illness and
child-care made marriage an entirely
different factor in the life of the human
race than it had been in the pre-serum
years one philosopher said that all
of its jobs had been amplified and
elaborated and all of its sorrows and
burdens minimized to the point of dis-
appearance it seemed that the human
race was experiencing the co-relation
and contacts of angels rather than the
mere union of animals

  all these facts should have gone
far to prolong the individual marriage
and cause divorce to disappear as a
social process to the astonishment of
the students of human behavior this
result did not follow the percentage
of divorce increased in direct propor-
tion to the decrease in the death rate
and the cessation of childbirth every-
body was burden-free everybody was
married but nearly everyone divorced
his or her mate and tried again to make
a more favorable and happier union
it really did not make much difference
to a woman who her husband was so
long as she had one all men were
much alike all healthy industrious
vigorous and happily kind all women
were beautiful intelligent and true to
their husbands of the month every-
body acted in a gentlemanly and lady-
like manner but the opposite sexes
just did not seem to be able to live to-
gether for any length of time

  and the reason was not hard to find
the family had disappeared

  husband and wife remained as ever
but children had disappeared from the
picture

  in married life there was no cement-
ing force

hiram smith takes a trip

the purple flash more than any
other newspaper had profited by
the changing social conditions
from the first under the insistent urging
of its secret owner hiram smith the
one time -wolf of wall street it had
been the leading proponent of the neces-
sity of the worlds rapidly adjusting it-
self to the new order of life

  as a tabloid it had ceased to exist
the pabulum on which the tabloid pub-
lications fed which made possible the
interest fleeting and infantile of the
adenoid moron was now a thing of the
past gone were the days of murder
scandal and disclosures of gross im-
morality these conditions ceased to
exist with all other diseases of all pub-
lishers smith was the first to see the
handwriting on the wall and the need
for a radical change his daily was
now called the rosey daunt a name
strikingly symbolic and suggestive of the
new era it had become a paper for
the intelligentsia the editorials of which
appealed only to the best interests of
the race

  smith saw with ever increasing in-
terest and a growing concern the
changes in the emotional life of the
country most people simply felt the
increasing comfort and happiness and
cared little for the profound biological
chances back of those changes smith
was interested he was not sure that
all was well with the new cultural pat-
tern of life 

  he wanted to talk things over with
biddle but biddle was gone smith
thought about it for one day talked
it over with his wife for another day
and then issued his order it was a
short command of three syllables
find biddle

  as that order had back of it over a
life everlasting



hundred million dollars there could be
no doubt that hiram smith was in
earnest

  six months and five million were
spent in the search and there was noth-
ing to show for it except failure it
was sally fanning who with her
womanly intuition supplied the neces-
sary clue she reminded smith that
at one time biddle had used the name
of harry ackerman was it possible
that he had reverted to the use of that
name so smith issued another order
find harry ackerman

  and that order brought results

  hiram took the night plane to quebec
and the first boat out of there for
chicoutimi he had to go down the
st lawrence river and up the sague-
nay river on the little steamer
chugged between high precipitous cliffs
of laurentian granite till at last a
thousand feet above them to the left
they saw a madonna holding in her
arms the christ child made out of
wood painted white and eighty feet
high it seemed little larger than a child
from the river below

  go on to the next landing on the
left smith told the captain and let
me off there

  i do not think there is anyone liv-
ing there now protested the captain
better go on to chicoutimi

  no i know what i am doing

  so he got off at the next landing for
the next hour the rich man toiled up
the mountain path arriving finally at
the top there he found a little stone
house with a little stone fence around
it and smoke pouring out of the chim-
ney

  smith knew that he had come to the
end of the trail

  he knocked at the door and hearing
no reply opened it

  at a table looking through a micro-
scope was biddle

ljello biddle called smith

 n well well replied the as-
tonished scientist how did you find
me

 cost me a lot of time and a lot
of money but it was time and money
well spent what are you doing here
your place is back in the world receiv-
ing the well-earned applause of the
nation

 i am not so sure about that but
wont you stay have you your bag-
gage i have not heard from the world
for so long that i am interested and
then besides that i want the news from
my friends how are they mrs
smith and the boy and harry wild and
sally and everybody

 you would be surprised and you
would not be asking that question if
you were back in the world no one
ever says how are you feeling be-
cause the answer is too obvious the
nation is gloriously healthy and wealthy
and perhaps wise though i am not so
sure about that the missus is fine we
are still living together and the boy is
almost a man the finest lad you ever
saw harry wild and sally are mar-
ried and they are still living together
i guess we hold the record for lengthy
marriages but i wanted to see you
i just had to see you

 i am glad you are here how is

the purple flash

  has the largest circulation of any
paper in the world a real money maker
i changed the name to the rosey dawn
and believe me it is a real mental
hygiene cultural sheet you would not
know it if you saw it

  and you are still the wolf of wall
street

 in memory only wall street has
disappeared when congress passed the
stabilization bill trading in stocks and
bonds became a thing of the past it

was just like trading pennies nothing
to it it was not even good sport

so the financial world has changed
everything has changed you would
not know it for the same place come
on back with me on the next steamer
you surely must be interested

  yes and no i realize that i should
be but i am working on a new problem
you see i have a lot of little animal
friends in the next room i guess i was
always happier with unsolved problems
than with solved ones if the world
is purged from disease i feel that i
should be satisfied to leave it be that
way so i just came away and left it
i would have had too many interrup-
tions if i had remained

  of course you had your own reasons
for isolating yourself

  certainly most hermits do but
tell me about things what are they
doing in little old new york

  you mean the men or the women
  everybody

tttell they are all healthy and
w happy work about three hours
a day four days a week and the rest
of the time amuse themselves in all
kinds of new ways that question of
amusement would interest you all the
old-fashioned cottage industries are
being revived like weaving and metal-
working most women are doing their
own sewing and housekeeping not
much cooking you see people do not
eat the way they did just drink lots of
water

  everybody is married all are just
as happy as they can be till they decide
to get a divorce and try somebody else
it is all a perfectly lovely arrangement
and so far there seems to be no jeal-
ousy i have talked to lots of the
divorcees and they simply say they just
want to live with somebody else so

they do it for two or three months and
then try it all over again

  seeking happiness 

  no everybody is happy all the time
just want a change

  how is the death rate

  there isnt any nobody dies unless
there is some kind of a terrible acci-
dent you see there is no disease tell
me one thing biddle how long are
we going to live

  i do not know

  do you think it is going to be life
everlasting

  i really do not know 

  i hope not you see there is not
much excitement in life nowadays for
some reason the thrill has gone out of
it it has too much precision and not
enough poker everybody lias enough
to eat enough to wear enough to
amuse himself with enough money to
pay his simple expenses there is noth-
ing to worry about in fact some of
my friends say that the young people
who were just growing up when they
received the serum cannot understand
what we older ones mean when we say
that we used to worry over the problems
of life they cannot understand what
a life filled with sickness and debt and
struggle birth and death means even
with the adults the memory is fast
fading

  i guess that is natural said the
inventor

  perhaps

  what are the men doing with their
spare time

  oh various fads had their day
jigsaw puzzles crossword puzzles cross-
country walking and all that sort
of thing lately a good many of the
men are whittling

 what

  just making things out of a piece of
wood with a penknife did you ever
life everlasting



see a man do that take a nice soft
piece of white pine without any knots in
it and just make a lot of nice long shav-
ings if you want to you can do it
mechanically without thinking the men
were making all kinds of little things
model rowboats and napkin rings and
little wooden birds and that sort of
thing keeps the women busy at that

  in what way

vou see wtmen always have been
sort of clean creatures but since
they are free from disease and family
duties and various cares they have a
lot of time on their hands it seems
that the healthier they become the
cleaner they want their homes and sur-
roundings to be so every woman
spends a few hours a day out on the
streets of new york making the town
tidy it would be really comical if
it were not so serious i bet that for
every whittler on the sidewalks of new
york there is a woman and sometimes
two waiting with a dust-pan and brush
to sweep up the shavings when the man
gets through often they even hold a
little bag so the shavings can drop right
into the bag instead of on the street
makes the man nervous and he goes
somewhere else but wherever he goes
a woman is after him tidying up i
hear there is an exclusive dub in the
nineties just for whittlers and they
brag that never a woman will enter to
disturb them or their shavings

 well so long as everybody is
happy

 sure what difference does it
make let the chips fall where they
may i said in an editorial what dif-
ference does it make so long as they
are clean chips but the women are cer-
tainly keeping after us men i dont recall
when they have ever kept us cleaner

  how do the men feel about it

  oh just about the way they always
have you see the sexes are rather
nice to each other not like the old days
when there was so much bickering i
suppose there is really very little to
quarrel about the way things are
unpack your things suggested bid-
dle and then we will take a walk we
will go down as far as the madonna
you will be interested in that as a work
of art

  two hours later they stood in the cold
chill of the afternoon in the shadow of
the giant mother smith looked at the
scientist

  by the way he suddenly asked
how is your boy

  i think that he is fine

  did he get better you know what
i mean you said you were working
on the serum for his sake

  yes i remember i said that

  and he is well and happy

  yes i think so i havent seen him
for some time you see he is with
his mother

  smith bent over picked up a rock and
threw it over the cliff into the river a
thousand feet below he looked at the
inventor

  you are white man he exclaimed
thats odd you must have been stay-
ing in the house too much but all the
rest of us are brown a golden brown a
healthy beautiful hazel brown the
doctors said it was the effect of the
serum you are not that way you are
white

  biddle smiled as he replied

  you see i never took the serum my-
self with the wife and the boy away
from me somehow i thought i would
be happier if i went without it

  but someday you will get sick as we
used to and die

  that is why i never took it it is
cold we should go back

the robot babies

ary gregory had nothing
to do

 her school for unusual
children was closed there were no more
unusual children

  in fact there were few children of
any kind and no babies

  her restless mind her ability as a
philanthropist and her millions were all
idle for lack of opportunity she felt
there should be something for her to do
someway in which she could benefit her
nation deliberately seeking an oppor-
tunity for welfare she went to new
york city there she called on hiram
smith since her fathers death he had
cared for the gregory estate and had
made a good job of it he had just
come back from his trip to canada and
had come back doing a lot of hard and
difficult thinking

  i am glad to see you mary he
said i have a lot to do with the in-
vesting of your money but it is not
often you spend the time to come and
see me you look well

  i am well i guess we are all well
since we took the serum i came to new
york a week ago to see you found you
were out of town and decided to visit
some of my old friends till your return
how are they all happy i sup-
pose 

  certainly everybody is happy but
i will say this so many of them have
developed the most peculiar way of
spending their time of course that
seems to be the hardest thing to do now-
adays finding things to fill in the leisure

  what are they doing mary
playing with toys playhouses little
sets of china and taking care of pets i
never saw so many different kinds of

animals and birds in my life outside of
a zoo one of the girls even had a de-
natured skunk

  and dolls china and rag and
bisque black white and yellow big and
little pretty and ugly fat dolls dolls with
spider legs dolls with hair and without
hair even- yvoman is collecting dolls

  spending her time making dollie
clothes and giving tea parties for them
and that is not all some of them pre-
tend that they are just little girls instead
of big women found one of my friends
playing on a toy piano waits till her
husband goes to work and then starts
with one or two fingers playing

pony pony stepping high

i will ride you bye and bye

  and that woman can play by the
hour from mozart and beethoven it
does not seem to affect the men the same
way one of my old college chums how-
ever took me down into the cellar of
their home they live in a house that
actually has a cellar she said that her
husband developed the habit of spending
a good deal of time down there and at
last she became so curious that she just
had to go down and see what he was
doing the man had been whittling dolls
out of wood he put black shoe buttons
in for eyes and made the mouth red with
red ink or it might have been his blood
she thought he had bought pieces of
silk downtown and had tried to make
dresses for the dolls and had made little
beds for them to sleep in she said that
in the old days she just knows she would
have cried but of course nobody cries
now because all are too happy she never
told him she knew what he was doing
only after that when he went to work
she went down in the cellar and played
with his whittled dolls she said that in
some way it made her feel that she was
closer to him they were thinking of a
divorce but now though they do not
life everlasting



talk about the dolls in the cellar they
feel that they had better live on together
for a few more months

qo that is the way they are spending

   their time

 that is the way i thought and
thought about it and finally i decided
what to do all this fuss over dolls and
pets and childish pleasures is just a sub-
stitution they are not honest with them-
selves for what they really want is some-
thing alive real babies

  it seems that they cannot have them
answered smith

  it seems that way but perhaps they
will have them some-time and if they
wait too long they wont know how to
care for them if this condition of child-
less society keeps up there will be mil-
lions of women who have never held a
little baby in their arras and would not
know what to do if they found one there
you see a lot of the knowledge of infant
care is transmitted by word of mouth and
actual practice from the older generation
of women to the younger if we wait
fifty years before a new lot of babies are
born they will suffer from lack of actual
knowledge on the part of their mothers
to care for them even the nurses wont
know how there wont be any nurses
anyway and not many doctors

  so i have an idea i want you to take
some of my millions and start a school
for mothers get the best physicians and
nurses you can hire to prepare lectures
buy a broadcasting station that will reach
every part of the country give regular
lectures on the care of the child at differ-
ent ages from birth to the age of six-
i am sure that every woman will be glad
to listen to the broadcasting of these talks
aiid will practice the various lessons on
her baby

  but the woman will not have a baby
mary gregory that is what the whole
trouble is there arent any babies

  i want jou to have some made
hiram smith threw up his hands in
despair

 how where when what do you
mean 

  silly i mean robot babies start
your inventors to work fabricate babies
out of rubber put machinery inside of
them so they will cry and move their
arms and legs i just have the general
idea but any clever inventor will sup-
ply the details make babies that can
be washed and fed and dressed and put
to sleep make different sized babies so
they can be exchanged when the time
comes for them to grow older put ton-
sils in them to be taken out and adenoids
to make them snuffle and intestines to
give them colic start in and make twenty
million of them as fast as you can sell
them to the women who can pay and give
them away to the women who cannot pay
and send the bill to my estate do you
see my idea get the fathers interested
in it have lectures for them have such
talks as this what to do when your wife
is sick and the three-year-old daughter
complains of the earache i wish biddle
was available there is a man who would
understand what i mean

  biddle is up in canada i have just
been visiting him

  you have did you talk about the
disappeared birth rate

  i did

  what did he say

  not much something about having
to pay a price for everything in life that
nothing was ever given away i suppose
he thought that the absence of death was
paid for by the absence of birth or some-
thing like that he did not want to talk
about children do you know about his
having a boy told me the boy was do-
ing well and was with his mother
he said that

  something like that do you under-
stand it 


amazing stories

  i do that was just his way of saying
they were both dead

iram smith started the millions
of mary gregory to work he
gave the new idea considerable space in
the rosey dawn the novelty spread
like wildfire women discarded their pets
and their fantastic dolls and put in their
application for a robot baby factories
were opened thousands of men put to
work that was an odd thing every
invention making the robot babies possi-
ble every minute of work done on them
in the factories was masculine men al-
most fought for the right to work in
those factories women were turned
away in disdain this work said the
men of the nation was a purely mascu-
line one

  meantime the series of lectures was
being prepared only the greatest ex-
perts were employed experiences were
exchanged old books were read elderly
women were consulted and at last two
hundred lectures were written covering
every possible situation up to the age of
six years then men and women were
carefully tested for their ability to broad-
cast those lectures at the end of a year
everything was ready for the start of a
six hour daily programme by that time
six million women had infant robots and
more were being fabricated at the rate of
a hundred thousand a week

  and from the station the lectures went
to the waiting women in america the
seven oclock bedtime lecture was in-
stantly popular

  women once again learned how to care
for babies but cleverly built as they
were they were at their best simply
well designed machines they could be
cared for but they could not respond to
that care they could be loved but they
could not love more than ever the
women of america realized that their
lives were empty and would remain empty

till once again they were able to hold
little children real little children pitiful
lovable needful helpless babies in their
arms

  mary gregory she who had never
known what it was to be a mother recog-
nized the need more and more clearly
she told smith so

  you have to find out whether biddle
can and will do something to help us
she demanded he knows more about
the serum than any other living man he
ought to know what it can do and what
it cannot do if he will only tell us that
in twenty-five fifty years from now the
american women can have children we
will be satisfied it seems that we are
all going to live a long time and we can
wait if there is hope during the waiting
and babies at the other end of the long
years you have to see him and tell him
how we feel see if he cannot help us
in some way more women in america
now know how to take intelligent care of
babies than ever before in the history of
the world what good is that knowledge
if there are no babies what good is
living without babies see him if you
cannot convince him of the need let me
take a number of representative women
up to canada and state our case to him
ill go agreed smith but i am
afraid that he will not see this the wav
you see it

  he will have to see it our way ex-
claimed mary gregory

the women decide

ary gregory led a company
of women into canada

  at the last moment hiram
smith refused to undertake the negotia-
tions with biddle the inventor he felt
somehow that it was none of his busi-
ness he was not sure that he wanted
to tell where the scientist had his house
life everlasting



of refuge from the world but after
talking it over with his wife he deter-
mined that he would throw the dice and
let fate decide what was in store for the
future of the human race so he told
mary gregory where biddle lived and
how to get there

  biddle was accustomed to have the un-
expected happen in his life but he was
genuinely surprised when twenty-one
women suddenly came up to his stone
home and knocked at the door he did
his best to be polite and tried to find
seats for all of his visitors he made tea
for them and served it with some little
cakes but they had to take turns drink-
ing the tea because no lonely hermit ever
had twenty-one tea cups unless he had a
mania for collecting them and not many
isolates even had twenty-one little cakes
at one time

  but at last everyone had a little tea
and then the women asked biddle to sit
down and listen to the reason for their
visit mary gregory acted as the spokes-
man for the delegation

  we represent the federated womens
clubs of north america the rich
woman explained these women stand
for the best of womanhood in every walk
of life we feel that we know what the
american woman thinks how she feels
what she wants our requests to you
come from fifty million mature women
any action we take will be satisfactory to
all of our sisterhood now that you
know who we are may we ask you some
questions

  you may ask them i am not sure i
can answer them

  we understand that said miss
gregory we know that some questions
may be hard even impossible for you to
answer but at least we know that you
will tell the truth first how long will
the serum last will it have to be re-
newed wfll future doses be as power-

ful will the individual reach maturity
and remain there indefinitely

  i am not sure my opinion is that
the first dose of serum will last a very
long time all that it did was to liberate
power which power is evidently capable
of splitting the hydrogen atom to make
more power consequently it may act
somewhat like perpetual motion

  if it acts the way i think no one will
ever have to take the second dose but
if he should take a second dose he prob-
ably will receive the same effect as from
the first dose of course i may be wrong
it seems that when a person once has the
serum he will live for a long time a full
grown healthy vigorous adult he would
die by drowning or by being cut in two
by an accident but unless something ter-
rible happened to him he would live a
very long time

  why have the women of america be-
come childless

  i am not sure all i know is that all
the animals i experimented on became
sterile perhaps it is a provision of na-
ture to increase the power of the serum
perhaps there is somediing in the serum
that acts but i knew it to be true in
the animals i experimented with like
mice i hoped that it would not be true
in the human race that was one of the
things we had to gamble on

  do you believe that some time
twenty-five years from now or fifty
years the conditions will change and
children will once again be born into the
world

  probably not i haw twelve mice who
have had the serum for nearly five years
that is a long time for a mouse to live
they have never had any little ones
what is your thought in regard to
the problem 

tt looks as though it was a kind of ar-
rangement the only way things conld
happen suppose with the help of the


amazing stories

serum the average man and woman lives
to be a thousand years old suppose that
every three years each woman gave birth
to a child gloriously healthy herself
fully realizing what the serum did for her
she would insist that her children receive
the serum as soon after birth as possible
in no time at all the world large as it is
would be overcrowded with humanity
now we have a population that can be
cared for it will never grow any larger
and only very slowly will it grow
smaller

  do you realize what it means to the
women of america to face those child-
less years those barren centuries of
existence 

  perhaps as much so as a lone man
can realize a womans feelings but you
women have everything else health hap-
piness ease the love of your husbands
every possible comfort you have a life
that is incomparably easier than the old
life ever could be it looks as though you
should be happy

  is there anything you can do for us
that will enable us to have families 

  perhaps there again i am not sure
but the principle of opposites is a very
strong one in nature we have light and
darkness strength and weakness men
and women heat and cold we used to
have laughter and tears happiness and
sorrow health and sickness sweet and
sour pure living and in and we have
serums and antiserums after i discov-
ered the biddle serum i started to dis-
cover the antidote or antiserum i did
not want to use it but i wanted to see
if there was such a thing

  did you find it

  i think so at least this is what i did
i found a mouse with cancer and gave
her the serum the cancer disappeared
and the mouse lived on far past the
usual length of life for a mouse i be-
came rather fond of her and i guess
she liked me a little but she never had

any babies two months ago i gave her
an injection of the antiserum she pro-
duced a little family raised them to inde-
pendence started to grow the cancer and
died in that case the antiserum did all
that could be expected of it

  could you give the antiserum to the
nation as you gave the serum

  yes if it became the right thing to
do 

  and it is your opinion that if a
woman received the antiserum she would
have children 

  yes of course it would be neces-
sary for her husband to have the anti-
serum also perhaps not i am not sure
but i think so

  would you excuse us if we talked
this tiling over privately

ertainly i will walk over to
the madonna you can find me
there it is only a few dty blocks from
here

  one hour later tbe women walked over
to where biddle was standing in the
shadow of the madonna

  we have decided announced mary
gregory the women of america ask
you for the formula of the antiserum
for general distribution

  no but we feel that every man and
wife who really want to have a family
should be allowed to make the decision
those who wish to remain childless can
do so

  are you sure you know what you are
asking for 

  we are

  it cannot be declared biddle
never in the history of the human race
have women been as free as they are
now they can come and go free from
the chains of a home and family their
love life is liberated from anxiety there
is no longer sickness to fear the death
of loved ones to dread you are happy
healthy and able to compete m every way
life everlasting



on equal terms with the male every-
thing woman has striven for in the past
you now have do you mean to say that
you are going to give it up deliber-
ately sacrifice all you have gained 

  we want our babies cried the
women

  but in having them you lose your
immortality having them you no longer
are eternal you will become sick dis-
eased crippled some of you will die in
childbirth some of your children will
die others will live to become defectives
epileptics cripples some of the ones
who live to maturity -will cause you
shame diey will become insane crim-
inals you will see children die in your
arms in years to come you will wish
they had died while they were sweet
babies sickness will come suffering sor-
row your health will break your hus-
bands will leave you for fresher women
you will die with one hand on your
breaking heart and the other on the bro-
ken cross that is what you are asking
for do you mean to tell me that you
knowing what the old biological urge for
offspring meant to womankind want to
change your glorious existence of to-day
for that

  we must have our babies cried the
women

vou must remember what life was

     sickness invalidism the breaking
back that never lost its ache etc etc
mary gregory stepped forward

  give us the formula sidney biddle
we have decided nothing you can say
will make us change our minds you
have not told us a thing we do not know
we know that we speak for our sister-
hood give us the formula sidney bid-
dle give us back our babies
trembling the scientist took out a note-
book and wrote slowly on a blank page
at last he tore the page out and handed
it to the rich woman

  here is what you are asking for any
chemist can make it any physician give
it now may i ask you to leave me here
i want to be alone once more

  they all left except mary gregory
why do you stay here in the shadow 
she asked

  because that woman knows how i
feel she knows what it means to have
a son die and not be able to save him
like her son died and mine

  why did you not take the serum
sidney biddle

  because i did not want to live for-
ever he replied

chapter xx

old lives for new

biddle lived alone for two more
years and then determined to go
back to civilization the first per-
son he called on was hiram smith the
secret owner of the rosey dawn the
rich man was delighted to meet his friend
again

  you look a little older a few more
white hairs but still very fit i guess that
arctic air agrees with you biddle

  i guess so clean living and hard work
are fine medicines how are you not
quite as brown as when i saw you last
anything happen

  slightly that boy of ours decided to
fall in love mighty nice girl and we
were all in favor of their marriage the
first thing we knew after the wedding
they went and took a dose of your anti-
serum so they could have a child that
just spoiled it all for the wife and me-
we had been making plans to live at
least for a thousand years but that would
mean that we would see our children and
our grandchildren grow old and die while
we were still m the vigorous golden ma-
turity of the biddle serum so what did
we do but go and get some of the anti-
serum ourselves now when the grand-


amazing stories

children come to visit us they will have
the old fashioned kind of grandparents
just nice old white-haired people who
can try to live their youth again in their
childrens children

   so you sacrificed everything not for
the love of a child but for the love of a
grandchild 

  thats it you would think it was
sacrifice if you had seen me with an at-
tack of rheumatism this last week

   biddle laughed a friendly sympathetic
tearful laugh

   just an old fool you were smith just
an old fool by the way where are my
old friends harry wild and sally
fanning 

  they are married he is back at the
old news stand and they have a little
apartment close to where they both lived
before you met them makes me worry
about the boy seeing harry nowadays
give me the address

  sure but i do not think i would go
and see them you remember howr they
were the time you saw them on the lawn
in front of my home well when you
remember them just think of them the
way they were then

   i shall have to see them the way they
are now replied biddle i have to
find out something

   he called at the little apartment late
that night harry wild answered his
knock on the door

  its ackerman sally its ackerman
our old friend and more than welcome
come right in and sit down let me have
your hat sir this is an honor to have
you come and see us

   it is indeed echoed sally

  and how are all the mice asked
biddle

  you should see them replied sally
dozens of them into everything but i
will say this that the baby is fond of
them keeps quiet for an hour at a time

when i am too busy to amuse her just
watching them play around the floor
so there is a baby

  finest girl you ever saw said the
newsboy looks just like her mother
glad it was a girl we should not have
known what to do with a boy

  we are telling her that so she wont
think we were disappointed explained
sally we are saying it now before she
knows the meaning of words so we shall
be sure to say it when she learns to talk
we want her to be sure we loved her
they insisted that he come and see the
baby they made him say that he had
never seen a finer baby and they fed him
coffee and sandwiches and made him
promise he would come often to see them
when he left harry went down to the
front door with him

as they stood in the doorway biddle
looked at the little man curiously
you are lame harry he said have
you hurt yourself

  no but my old trouble came back
my bad leg is short again and my back is
slowly growing crooked

  well well that is too bad but you
keep on smiling

  sure i have everything to live for
now fine wife sweet baby good busi-
ness why shouldnt i be happy

  that is fine harry keep on smil-
ing

  i will mr biddle bye the way do
you know of a good remedy for asthma
sally has had some real bad spells since
the baby came and i do wish someone
knew what to do for her

  i am sorry ill send her some stra-
monium leaves burn them and inhale the
smoke that will help her asthma is a
difficult thing to cure well good night
harry my boy i am glad about the
baby

  good night mr biddle and thanks
for looking us up send me your address
life everlasting



next week the old purple flash is going
to come back on the stands and i want
to send you some of the first copies i
bet that the wolf of wall street will
make it a real tabloid it ought to go big
the people are getting hungry for that
kind of a paper

  it was all too much for biddle

  he took the first train for quebec and
the first boat for his mountain home he
walked slowly up the mountain path it
was a hard climb he was not as young
as he had been he found the house
open and a fire burning in the fireplace
no one there

  he put down his bag and walked across
the crest of the mountain to the madonna
under the shadow a woman sat as he
came near she walked over to meet him

  mary gregory he sighed what
are you doing here

  i wanted to come she replied you
need a woman if you had a woman in
the house with you you might do some-
thing worth while invent something that
wrould be of real help to mankind

  but i am an old man mary he cried
an old man growing older

  i have taken the antiserum she said
now i can grow old with you

let there be light

we are no worse off
remarked the colonel in
the course of the day to
his assembled compan-
ions than arago biot
and rodriguez were when they were
measuring the arc from dunkirk to
ivica they were uniting the spanish
coast and the island by a triangle of
which the sides were more than eighty
miles long rodriguez was installed on
an isloated peak and kept up lighted
lamps at night while the french as-
tronomers lived in tents a hundred
miles away in the desert of las
palmas for sixty nights arago and
biot watched for the signal and dis-
couraged at last were about to re-
nounce their labor when on the sixty-
first night appeared a light which it was
impossible to confound with a star
surely gentlemen if those french as-
tronomers could watch for sixty-one
nights in the interests of science we
english and russians must not give up
at the end of nine

  the colonels companions most heart-
ily approved the sentiment but they
could have said that arago and biot did
not endure the tortures of hunger dur-

ing their long vigil of some two months

  in the course of the day mokoum per-
ceived an unusual agitation in the mak-
ololo camp he thought at first that
they were about to raise the siege but
after some contemplation he discovered
that their attentions were evidently hos-
tile and that they would probably as-
sault the mountain in the course of the
night

  toward six oclock when the night
was coming on with its tropical celerity
the engineer descended the mountian and
proceeded to light the boiler fire of the
steamboat it was still the colonels in-
tention not to effect an escape until the
last extremity moreover he was firm in
his determination to abide until the night
was advanced that he might give him-
self the last chance of observing the
signal from mount volquiria the sail-
ors were placed at the foot of the ram-
part with orders to defend the breaches
to the last all arms were ready and
the mitrailleuse armed with the am-
munition that they had in store spread
its formidable mouth across the em-
brasure

  for several hours the colonel and
strux posted in the narrow donjon kept
a constant watch on the peak of vol-
quiria the horizon was dark while the
finest of the southern constellations were
resplendent in the zenith there was no
measuring a meridian



it was probable that the natives were about to make a last attack on the
fortress before retiring finally to maketo


amazing stories

wind and not a sound broke the impos-
ing stillness of nature the bushman
however posted on a projection of rock
heard sounds which gradually became
more distinct he was not mistaken
the makololos were at length commenc-
ing their assault on the mountain

   until ten oclock the assailants did
not move their fires were extinguished
and camp and plain were alike wrapped
in obscurity suddenly mokoum saw
shadows moving up the mountain till
the besiegers seemed but a few hundred
feet from the plateau on which stood the
fort

   now then quick and ready cried
mokoum

   the garrison immediately advanced to
the south side of the fort and opened a
running fire on the assailants the
makololos answered by a war cry and
in spite of the firing continued to ad-
vance in the light caused by the flash
of the guns the europeans perceived
such swarms of natives that any resis-
tance seemed impossible but still they
trusted that their well-directed balls were
doing considerable execution and they
discerned that not a few of the natives
were rolling down the sides of the moun-
tain hitherto however nothing ar-
rested them with savage cries they
continued to press on in compact order
without even waiting to hurl a single
assegai colonel everest put himself at
the head of his little troop who seconded
him admirably not excepting palander
who probably was handling a gun for al-
most the first time sir john now on
one rock now on another sometimes
kneeling sometimes lying did wonders
and his gun heated with the rapidity of
the repeated loading began to burn his
hands mokoum as ever was patient
bold undaunted in his confidence

   but the valor and precision of the be-
sieged could avail nothing against the
torrent of numbers where one native

fell he was replaced by twenty more
and after a somewhat prolonged opposi-
tion colonel everest felt that he must
be overpowered not only did the na-
tives swarm up the south slope of the
mountain but they made an ascent also
by the side slopes they did not hes-
itate to use the dead bodies of the fallen
as stepping stones and then even lifted
them up and sheltered themselves behind
them as they mounted the scene re-
vealed by the flash of the firearms was
appalling and the europeans saw enough
to make them fully aware that they could
expect no quarter and that they were
being assaulted by barbarians as savage
as tigers

  at half-past ten the foremost natives
had reached the plateau the besieged
who were still uninjured the natives
not yet having employed their bows and
assegais were thoroughly conscious
they were impotent to carry on a combat
hand to hand the colonel in a calm
clear voice that could be heard above
the tumult gave the order to retire
with a last discharge the little band
withdrew behind the walls loud cries
greeted their retteat and the natives
immediately made a nearer approach in
their attempt to scale the central breach

  a strange and unlooked for recep-
tion awaited them suddenly at first
and subsequently repeated at intervals of
but a few minutes there was a growling
reverberation as of rolling thunder the
sinister sound was the report of the ex-
ploding mitrailleuse which sir john
had been prepared to employ and now-
worked with all his energy its twenty-
five muzzles spread over a wide range
and the balls continually supplied by a
self-feeding arrangement fell like hail
among the assailants the natives swept
down at each discharge responded at
first with a howl and then with a harm-
less shower of arrows

  she plays well said the bushman
measuring a meridian



approaching sir john when you have
played your tune let me play mine

  but there was no need for sir john
to be relieved the mitrailleuse was soon
silent the makololos were struck with
consternation and had sought shelter
from the torrent of bullets having re-
tired under the flanks of the fort leav-
ing the plateau strewn with numbers of
their dead

  in this instant of respite the colonel
and strux regained the donjon and
there collecting themselves in compos-
ure as complete as if they were under
the dome of an observatory they  kept
a constant eye upon their telescope and
scanned the peak of volquiria when
after a short period of rest the yells of
the makalolos made them aware that
the combat was renewed they only per-
severed in their determination and re-
solved that they would alternately re-
main to guard their invaluable instru-
ment

  the combat in truth had been re-
newed the range of the mitrailleuse
was inadequate to reach all the natives
who uttering their cries of mortal ven-
geance rallied again and swarmed up
every opening the besieged protected
by their firearms defended the breaches
foot by foot they had only received a
few scratches from the points of the as-
segais and were able to continue the
fight for half an hour with unabated
ardor

  toward half-past eleven while the
colonel was in the thick of the fray in
the middle of an angry fusillade mat-
thew strux appeared at his side his
eye was wild and radiant an arrow had
just pierced his hat and quivered above
his head

  the signal the signal he cried

  the colonel was incredulous but as-
certaining the correctness of the welcome
announcement discharged his rifle for
the last time and with an exuberant

shout of rejoicing rushed toward the
donjon followed by the intrepid col-
league there kneeling down he put
his eye to the telescope and perceived
with the utmost delight the signal so
long delayed and yet so patiently ex-
pected

  it was truly a marvelous sight to see
these two astronomers work during the
tumult of the conflict the natives had
by their numbers forced the enclosure
antf sir john and the bushman were
contending for every step the euro-
peans fought with their balls and hatch-
ets while the makololos responded with
their arrows and assegais

  meanwhile the colonel and strux in-
tently continued their observations and
palander equally composed noted down
their oft repeated readings more than
once an arrow grazed their head and
broke against the inner wall of the don-
jon but their eye was ever fixed on the
signal and reading the indications of the
vernier they incessantly verified each
others calculations

  only once more said strux slid-
ing the telescope along the graduated
scale an instant later and it would
have been too late for any observations
but the direction of the light was cal-
culated to the minutest fraction of a
second and at that very instant an enor-
mous stone hurled by a native sent the
register flying from palanders hands
and smashed the repeating circle

  they must now fly in order to save
the result which they obtained at the
cost of such continuous labor the na-
tives had already penetrated the case-
mate and might be at any moment ap-
pear in the donjon the colonel and
his colleagues caught up their guns and
palander his precious register and all
escaped through one of the breaches
their several companions some slightly
wounded were ready to cover their re-
treat but just as they were about to de-


amazing stories

scend the north side of the mountain
strux remembered that they had failed
to kindle the signal in fact for the
completion of the survey it was neces-
sary that the two astronomers on mount
volquiria should in their turn observe
the summit of mount scorzef and were
doubtless anxiously expecting the an-
swering light

  the colonel recognized the imperative
necessity for yet one more effort and
whilst his companions with almost su-
perhuman energy repulsed the natives
he re-entered the donjon this donjon
was formed of an intricate frame work
of dry wood which would readily ignite
by the application of a flame the col-
onel set it alight with the discharge from
the muzzle of his gun and rushing out
rejoined his companions in a few mo-
ments rolling their mitrailleuse before
them the europeans under a shower of
arrows and various missies were de-
scending the mountain and driving back
the natives with a deadly fire reached
the steamboat the engineer according
to orders had kept up the steam

  the mooring was cast off the screw
set in motion and the queen and czar
advanced rapidly over the dark and quiet
waters they were shortly far enough
out to see the summit of the mountain
the donjon was blazing like a beacon
and its light would be easily discerned
from the peak of volquiria a resound-
ing cheer of triumph from the english
and russians greeted the bonfire they had
left behind

  emery and zorn would have no cause
for complaint they had exhibited the
twinkling of a star and had been an-
swered by the glowing of a sun

  there was no question that the con-
flagration they had started had given the
best possible indication of the position of
mount scorzef the triangle was closed
the work was completed at the last
moment

chapter xxii

palanders last escapade

when daylight reappeared the
vessel was nearing the northern
shore of the lake there was
no trace of natives consequently the
colonel and his companions who had
been ready armed laid aside their guns
as the queen and czar drew up in a
little bay in the rocky shore the bush-
man sir john and one of the sailors
set out at once to reconnoiter the neigh-
borhood they could perceive no sign
of makololos and fortunately they found
game in abundance troops of antelopes
grazed in the long grass and in the shel-
ter of the thickets and a number of
aquatic birds frequented the shores of
the lake the hunters returned with
ample provision and the whole party
could enjoy the savory antelope meat a
supply of which was now unlikely to
fail them again

 the camp was arranged under the
great willows near the lake on the
banks of a small river the colonel
and strux had arranged to meet on
the north shore with the pioneer s little
party and the rest afforded by the
few days of expectation was gratefully
enjoyed by all palander employed him-
self in rectifying and adjusting the re-
sults of the latest observations while
mokoum and sir john hunted most
vigorously over the fertile well-watered
country abounding in game with which
the englishman would have been de-
lighted had it been in his power to
complete a purchase on behalf of the
british government three days after
on the th of march some gun-shots
announced the arrival of the remainder
of the party for whom they tarried
emery zorn the two sailors and the
pioneer were all in perfect health their
theodolite the only instrument remaining
measuring a meridian



to the commission was safe the young
astronomers and their companions were
received with joyous congratulations
in a few words they related that their
journey had not been devoid of diffi-
culty for two days they had lost their
way in the forests that skirted the moun-
tainous district and with only the vague
indication of the compass they would
never have reached mount volquiria
if it had not been for the shrewd in-
telligence of the pioneer the ascent
of the mountain was rough and the de-
lay had caused the young astronomers
as much impatience as it had their col-
leagues on mount scorzef they had
carefully by barometrical observations
calculated that the summit of volquiria
was  feet above the level of the sea
the light increased by a strong reflector
was first lighted on the night of the
th thus the observers on mount
scorzef had perceived it as soon as it
appeared emery and zorn had easily
discerned the intense fire caused by the
burning fortress and with the theodolite
had completed the measurement of the
triangle

  and did you determine the latitude
of the peak said the colonel to emery

  yes most accurately replied em-
ery we found it to be   

  well gentlemen said the colonel
we may say that our task is ended we
have measured by means of sixty-three
triangles an arc of more than eight
degrees in length and when we have
rigidly corrected our results we shall
know the exact value of the degree and
consequently of the meter in this part
of the globe

  a cheer of satisfaction could not be
repressed amongst the others

  and now added the colonel we
have only to descend the zambesi in
order to reach the indian ocean is it
not so mr strux

  it is answered strux but i think

we ought still to adopt some means of
testing our previous operations let us
continue our triangles until we find a
place suitable for the direct measure-
ment of a base the agreement between
the lengths of the base obtainind by the
calculations and by the direct measure-
ment will alone tell what degree of ac-
curacy we ought to attribute to our
observations

  struxs proposition was unanimousl
adopted it was agreed to construct a
series of subsidiary triangles until a site
could be measured with the measuring
rods the steamboat descending the af-
fluents of the zambesi was to await the
travelers below the celebrated victoria
falls everything being arranged the
little troop with the exception of four
sailors on board the queen and czar
started the next day at sunrise some
stations had been chosen to the east
and the angles measured and along
this favorable country they hoped easily
to accomplish their auxiliary series the
bushman had adroitly caught a quagga
of which willing or unwilling he made
a beast of burden to carry the theodolite
the measuring-rods and some other lug-
gage of the caravan

  the journey proceeded rapidly the
undulating country afforded many points
of sight for the small accessory triangles
the weather was fine and it was not
needful to have recourse to nocturnal
observations the travelers could near-
ly always find shelter in the woods and
besides the heat was not insufferable
since some vapors arose from the pools
and streams which tempered the suns
rays every want was supplied by the
hunters and there was no longer any-
thing to be feared from the natives who
seemed to be more to the south of lake
ngami

  matthew strux and the colonel
seemed to have forgotten all their per-
sonal rivalry and although there was


amazing stories

no close intimacy between them they
were on the most perfect terms of cour-
tesy

  day after day during a period of
three weeks the observations steadily
proceeded for the measurement of a
base the astronomers required a tract of
land that should be level for several
miles and the very undulations of the
soil that were desirable for the establish-
ment of points of sight were unfavorable
for that observation they proceeded to
the northeast sometimes following the
right bank of cnobi one of the principal
tributaries of the upper zambesi in
order to avoid maketo the chief settle-
ment of the makololos they had now
every reason to anticipate that their re-
turn would be happily accomplished and
that no further natural obstacles would
occur and they hoped that their diffi-
culties were all at an end the country
which they were traversing was com-
paratively well known and they could
not be far from the villages of the zam-
besi which livingstone had lately visited
thus they thought with reason that all
the most arduous part of their task was
over when an incident of which the
consequences might have been serious
almost compromised the result of the
whole expedition

  nicholas palander was the hero or
rather was near being the victim of the
adventure

  the intrepid but thoughtless calcu-
lator unwarned by his escape from the
crocodiles had still the habit of with-
drawing himself from his companions
in an open country there was no great
danger in this but in woods palanders
abstraction might lead to serious con-
sequences strux and the bushman gave
him many warnings and palander
though much astonished at what he con-
sidered an excess of prudence promised
to conform to their wishes

  on the th some hours had passed

  since strux and mokoum had seen any-
thing of palander the little troop were
traveling through thickets of low trees
and shrubs extending as far as the hori-
zon it was important to keep together
as it would be difficult to discover the
track of any one lost in the wood but
seeing and fearing nothing palander
who had been posted pencil in one hand
the register in the other on the left
flank of the troop was not long in dis-
appearing

  when toward four oclock strux and
his companions found that palander was
no longer with them they became ex-
tremely anxious his former aberra-
tions were still fresh in their remem-
brance and it was probably the ab-
stracted calculator alone by whom they
had been forgotten the march was
stopped and they all shouted in vain
the bushman and the sailors dispersed
for a quarter of a mile in each direction
beating the bushes trampling through
the woods and long grass firing off their
guns but yet without success they
became still more uneasy especially mat-
thew strux to whose anxiety was joined
an extreme irritation against his un-
lucky colleague this was not the first
time that palander had served them thus
and if the colonel had laid any blame
on him strux would not have known
what to say under the circumstances
the only thing to be done was to en-
camp in the wood and begin a more
careful search

  the colonel and his companions had
just arranaged to place their camp near
a glade of considerable extent when a
cry unlike anything human resounded
at some distance to the left almost im-
mediately running at full speed ap-
peared palander his head was bare
his hair disheveled and his clothes tom
in some parts almost to rags his
companions plied him with questions

  distended eye whose compressed nostrils
still further hindered his short jerking
respiration could not bring out a word

 what had happened wrhy had he
wandered away and why did he ap-
pear so terrified at last to their re-
peated questions he gasped out in al-
most unintelligible accents something
about the registers

  the astronomers shuddered the reg-
isters on which was inscribed every re-
sult of their operations and which the
calculator had never allowed out of his
possession even when asleep these reg-
isters were missing no matter whether
palander had lost them or whether they
had been stolen from him they were
gone and all their labor was in vain

  while his companions mutely terri-
fied only looked at each other matthew
strux could no longer restrain his anger
he burst forth into all manner of in-
vective against the miserable creature
threatening him with the displeasure of
the russian government and adding
that if he did not suffer under the knout
he should linger out his life in siberia

  to all this palander answered but by
a movement of the head he seemed to
acquiesce in all these condemnations and
even thought the judgment would be too
lenient

  but perhaps he las been robbed
said the colonel at last

  what matters cried strux beside
himself what business had he so far
away from us after our continual
warning

  true replied sir john but we
ought to know whether he has lost the
registers or been robbed of them has
anyone robbed you palander contin-
ued he turning to the poor man who
had sunk down with fatigue

  palander made a sign of affirmation

  wrho continued sir john na-
tives makololos

  palander shook his head

  well then europeans asked sir
john

  no answered palander in a stifled
voice

  who then shouted strux shaking
his clenched fists in palanders face

  they were neither natives-nor white
men-but monkeys stammered out pal-
ander at last

  it was a fact that the unhappy man
had been robbed by a monkey and if
the consequences of the incident had
been less serious the whole party would
have broken out into laughter mokoum
explained that what had just happened
was of frequent occurrence many
times to his knowledge had travelers
been rifled by these pig-headed chacmas
a species of baboon very common in
south african forests the calculator
had been plundered by these animals
though not without a struggle as his
ragged garments testified still in the
judgment of his companions there was
no excuse to be made if he had re-
mained in his proper place this irre-
parable loss would not have occurred

  we did not take the trouble be-
gan colonel everest to measure an arc
of meridian in south africa for a blun-
derer like you-

  he did not finish his sentence con-
scious that it was useless to continue
to abuse the unhappy man whom strux
had not ceased to load with every variety
of vituperation the europeans were
without exception quite overpowered by
emotion but mokoum who was less
sensitive to the importance of the loss
retained his self-possession

  perhaps even yet he said some-
thing may be done to assist you in your
perplexity these chacmas are always
careful of their stolen goods and if we
find the robber we shall find the register
with him but time is precious and
none must be lost

  the bushman had opened a ray of


amazing stories

hope palander revived at the sugges-
tion he arranged his tattered clothes as
best he could and having accepted the
jacket of one sailor and the hat of
another declared himself ready to lead
his companions to the scene of his ad-
venture

  they all started off toward the west
and passed the night and the ensuing
day without any favorable result in
many places by traces on the ground
and the bark of the trees the bushman
and the pioneer recognized unmistakable
vestiges of the baboons of which pal-
ander affirmed that he was sure he had
seen no less than ten the party was
soon on their track and advanced with
the utmost precaution the bushman af-
firming that he could only count  suc-
cess in his search by taking the chacmas
by surprise since they were sagacious
animals such as could only be ap-
proached by some device of secrecy

  early the following morning one of
the russian sailors who was somewhat
in front perceived if not the actual
thief yet one of his associates he
prudently returned to the little troop
who came at once to a halt the euro-
peans who had resolved to obey mo-
koum in everything awaited his instruc-
tions the bushman begged them to
remain in quietness where they were
and taking sir john and the pioneer
turned toward the part of the wood al-
ready visited by the sailor carefully
keeping under shelter of the trees and
bushwood

  in a short time the bushman and his
two companions caught sight of one
chacma and almost immediately of nine
or ten more gamboling among the
bushes crouching behind a tree they
attentively watched the animals their
short tails did not reach the ground and
their powerful muscles sharp teeth and
pointed claws rendered them formidable
even to the beasts of prey these chac-

mas are the terror of the boers whose
fields of corn and maize and occasion-
ally whose habitations are plundered by
them

  not one of the animals had as yet
espied the hunters but they all con-
tinued their sport yelping and barking
as though they were great ill-favored
dogs the important point for deter-
mination was whether the actual pur-
loiner of the missing documents was
there all doubt was put aside when
the pioneer pointed out a chacma
wrapped in a rag of palanders coat
sir john felt that this creature must
be secured at any price but he was
obliged to act with great circumspection
aware as he was that a single false
movement would cause the whole herd
to decamp at once

  stay here said mokoum to the pio-
neer sir john and i will return to our
companions and set about surrounding
the animals but meanwhile do not lose
sight of them

  the pioneer remained at his post
while sir john and the bushman re-
turned to colonel everest the only
means of securing the suspected culprit
was to surround the whole troop to
accomplish this the europeans divided
into separate detachments one composed
of strux emery zorn and three sail-
ors was to join the pioneer and to
form a semicircle behind him and the
other comprising the colonel mokoum
sir john palander and the other three
sailors made a detour to the left in
order to fall back upon the herd from
the other side

  implicitly following the bushmans
advice they all advanced with the ut-
most caution their guns were ready
and it was agreed that the chacma with
the rags should be the aim for every
shot

  mokoum kept a watchful eye upon
palander and insisted upon his march-
measuring a meridian



ing close to himself lest his unguard-
edness should betray him into ome
fresh folly the worthy astronomer was
almost beside himself in consternation at
his loss and evidently thought it a ques-
tion of life or death

  after marching with the frequent
halts which the policy of being unob-
served suggested and continuing to di-
verge for half an hour the bushman
considered that they might now fall back
he and his companions each about
twenty paces apart advanced like a
troop of pawnees on a war-trail without
a word or gesture avoiding even the
least rustling in the branches suddenly
the bushman stopped the rest instantly
followed his example and standing with
their fingers on the triggers of their
guns were ready to raise them to their
shoulder the band of chacmas was
in sight they were already sensible of
some danger and seemed on the look-
out the great animal which had stolen
the registers had to their fancy an
appearance of being especially agitated
it had been already recognized by pal-
ander who muttered something like an
imprecation between his teeth

  the chacma looked as if it was mak-
ing signs to its companions some fe-
males with their young ones on their
shoulders had collected in a group and
the males went to and fro around them
the hunters still drew on one and all
keeping a steady eye direct toward the
ostensible thief all at once by an in-
voluntary movement palanders gun
went off in its hands sir john broke
out into an exclamation of disgust and
instantly afterward fired ten reports
followed three chacmas lay dead on the
ground and the rest with a prodigious
bound passed over the hunters heads

  the robber baboon alone remained
it darted at the trunk of a sycamore
which it climbed with amazing agility
and disappeared among the branches

the bushman having keenly surveyed
the spot asserted that the registers were
there concealed and fearing lest the
chacma should escape across the trees
he calmly aimed and fired the animal
wounded in the leg fell from branch
to branch

  in one of its fore-claws it was seen
to clutch the registers which it had taken
from the fork of the tree

  at the sight palander with a leap
like that of a chamois darted at the
chacma and a tremendous struggle en-
sued the cries of both man and beast
mingled in harsh and discordant strain
and the hunters dared not take aim at
the chacma for fear of wounding their
comrade strux beside himself with
rage shouted again and again that they
should fire and in his furious agitation
he would probably have done so if it
had not been that he was accidentally
without a cartridge for his gun which
had been already discharged

  the combat continued sometimes pal-
ander sometimes the chacma was up-
permost the astronomer his shoulders
lacerated by the creatures claws tried
to strangle his adversary at last the
bushman seizing a favorable moment
made a sudden dash and killed the ape
with one blow of his hatchet

  nicholas palander bleeding exhausted
and insensible was picked up by his
colleagues in his last effort he had recap-
tured his registers which he was found
unconsciously grasping to his bosom

  the carcass of the chacma was con-
veyed with glee to the camp at the
evening repast it furnished a delicious
meal to the hunters to all of them
but especially to palander not only had
the excitement of the chase quickened
their appetite for the palatable dish but
the relish was heightened by the grati-
fying knowledge that vengeance was sat-
isfied and the records saved

  the work was nearly ended

the task accomplished

palanders wounds were not
serious the bushman dressed the
contused limbs with herbs and the
worthy astronomer sustained by his
triumph was soon able to travel any
exuberance on his part however was
of short duration and he quickly became
again engrossed in his world of figures
he only now retained one of the reg-
isters because it had been thought
prudent that emery should take posses-
sion of the other under the circum-
stances palander made the surrender
with entire good humor

  the operation of seeking a plain suit-
able for a base was now resumed on
the st of april the march was some-
what retarded by wide marshes to these
succeeded numerous pools whose waters
spread a pestilential odor but by form-
ing larger triangles colonel everest and
his companions soon escaped the un-
healthy region

  the whole party were in excellent
spirits zorn and emery often con-
gratulated themselves on the apparent
concord that existed between their chiefs
zorn one day expressed his hope to his
friend that when they returned to eu-
rope they would find that peace had been
concluded between england and russia
so that they might remain as good
friends as they had been in africa

  emery replied that he acquiesced en-
tirely in the hope in days when war
is seldom long protracted they might
hope all would be terminated by the date
of their return

  zorn had already understood from
emery that it was not his intention to
return immediately to the cape and
expressed his hope that he might intro-
duce him to the observatory at kiew
this proposal emery expressed his de-

sire to embrace and added that he should
indulge the expectation that zorn would
at some future time visit the cape

  with these mutual agreements they
made their plans for future astronomical
researches ever reiterating their hopes
that the war would be at an end

  anyhow observed emery russia
and england will be at peace before
the colonel and strux i have no trust
in any reconciliation of theirs

  for themselves they could only re-
peat their pledges of mutual good-will

  eleven days after the adventure with
the chacmas the little troop not far
from the zambesi falls arrived at a
level plain several miles in extent and
perfectly adapted for the establishment
of a base on the edge of the plain rose
a native village composed of a few huts
containing a small number of inhab-
itants who received the europeans
kindly colonel everest found the prox-
imity of the natives very opportune since
the measurement of the base would oc-
cupy a month and being without wagons
or any material for an encampment he
would have had no resource but to pass
the time in the open air with no other
shelter than that afforded by the foliage

  the astronomers took up their abode
in the huts which were quickly appro-
priated for the use of their new occu-
pants their requirements were but
small their one thought was directed
towards verifying their calculations by
measuring the last side of their last
triangle

  the astronomers at once proceeded to
their work the trestles and measuring
rods were arranged with all the care
that had been applied to the earliest base
nothing was neglected all the conditions
of the atmosphere and the readings of
the thermometer were taken into ac-
count and the commission without flag-
ging broughtevery energy to bear upon
their final operation
measuring a meridian



  the work which lasted for five weeks
was completed on the th of may
when the lengths obtained had been
estimated and reduced to the mean level
of the sea at the temperature of 
fahrenheit palander and emery pre-
sented to their colleague the following
numbers

toises

new bases actually measured 
the same base deduced trigo-
nometrically from the entire
series 

difference between the calcula-
  tion and the observation---- 

  thus there was only a difference of
less than - of a toise that is to say
less than ten inches yet the first base
and the last were six hundred miles
apart

  when the meridian of france was
measured from dunkirk to perpignan
the difference between the base at melun
and that at perpignan was eleven inches
the agreement obtained by the anglo-
russian commission was still more re-
markable and thus made the work
accomplished in the deserts of africa
amid dangers of every kind more per-
fect than any previous geodetic operation

  the accuracy of this unprecedented
result was greeted by the astronomers
with repeated cheers

  according to palanders reductions
the value of a degree in this part of
the world was  toises this was
within a toise the same as was found by
lacaille at the cape in  thus with
the interval of a century the french
astronomer and the members of the
anglo-russian commission had arrived
at almost exactly the same result to
deduce the value of the mkter they
would have to wait the issue of the op-
erations which were to be afterward

undertaken in the northern hemisphere
the value was to be the  of
the quadrant of the terrestrial meridian
actording to previous calculations the
quadrant taking the depression of the
earth into account comprised 
mkters whether this was correct the
subsequent labors of the commission
would have to decide

	   

  the astronomers had now entirely fin-
ished their task and it only remained
for them to reach the north of the
zambesi by following inversely the route
afterward taken by dr livingstone in
his second voyage from  to 

  on the th of may after a some-
what laborious journey across a country
intersected with rivers they reached the
victoria falls these fine cataracts fully
justified their native name which sig-
nifies sounding smoke sheets of
water a mile wide crowned with a
double rainbow rushed from a height
twice that of niagara across the
deep basalt chasm the enormous torrent
produced a roar like peal after peal of
thunder

  below the cataract where the river
regained its calmness the steamboat
which had arrived a fortnight previously
by an inferior affluent of the zambesi
awaited the astronomers who soon took
their places on board

  there were two to be left behind
mokoum and the pioneer stood on the
bank in mokoum the english were
leaving not only a devoted guide but
one whom they might call a friend
sir john was especially sorry to part
from him and had offered to take him
to europe and there entertain him as
long as he pleased to remain but
mokoum had previous engagements in
fact he was to accompany livingstone
on the second voyage which the brave
traveler was about to undertake up the
zambesi and mokoum was not a man

to depart from his word he was pre-
sented with a substantial recompense
and what he prized still more the kind
assurances of regard of the europeans
who acknowledged how much they owed
to him as the steamer left the shore
to take the current in the middle of the
river sir johns last gesture was to
wave an adieu to his associate

  the descent of the great river whose
banks were dotted with numerous vil-
lages was soon accomplished the na-
tives regarding with superstitious admir-
ation the smoking vessel as it moved by
mysterious mechanism made no attempt
to obstruct its progress

  on the th of june the colonel and
his companions arrived at quilimane
one of the principal towns at the mouth
of the zambesi their first thought was
to ask for news of the war they found
that it had not yet come to a termina-
tion and that sebastopol was still hold-
ing out against the allied armies this
was a disappointment to the europeans
now so united in one scientific object
but they received the intelligence in si-
lence and prepared to start an aus-
trian merchant-vessel la novara was
just setting out for suez in that they
resolved to take their passage

  three days after as they were on the
point of embarking the colonel assem-
bled his colleagues and in a calm voice
reminded them how in the first eighteen

months they had together experienced
many trials and how they had been re-
warded by accomplishing a work which
would call forth the admiration of all
scientific europe he could not refrain
from giving expression to his trust that
they would feel themselves bound in
the common fellowship of a true alli-
ance

  strux bowed slightly but did not in-
terrupt the colonel who proceeded to
deplore the tidings of the continuation
of warfare when he referred to the
expected capitulation of sebastopol
strux indignantly rejected the possibility
of such an event which no union of
france and england he maintained
could ever effect

  there was however it was admitted
on all hands a propriety in the rus-
sians and english submitting to the
national status of hostility the neces-
sities of their position were thus clearly
defined and under these conditions they
embarked in company on board la
novara

  in a few days they arrived at suez
at the moment of separation emery
grasped zorns hand and said

  we are always friends michael

  always and everywhere william
ejaculated zorn and with this senti-
ment of mutual devotion they parted

  the commission was dissolved the
great work was complete

 the velocity of escape

by joe w skidmore

we have found by long experience that our readers like interplanetary
stories they give a scope for most exciting episodes and some of our
best authors have really in a sense made a reputation by this class of work
mr skidmore not only gives us a very good story of the adventures of men
on contending space ships but by introducing plenty of the personal element

makes it a truly exciting narration

the falcon swoops

avery much worried group
of famous scientists were
gathered together in one of
the united states government
secret underground chambers
the best scientific minds in all the world
had been hastily summoned to this impor-
tant conference from various countries
they had been gathered swift airplanes
and space cars had been utilized to gather
the great group of the worlds keenest
intellects

  had the meeting not been considering
a mighty problem that concerned the very
existence of the world itself it would
have been highly important for one rea-
son alone-the presence of donald mill-
stein famous scientist and adventurer
had been requested by none other than
the president of the united states just
now millstein was speaking and the
erudite and bearded gentlemen around the
council table listened hopefully and atten-
tively

  millstein was not of the usual type of
scientist he was not aged and bearded
neither was he bespectacled quite the
contrary he was young virile and upstand-

ing his fine figure and handsome fea-
tures had stirred the heart of many a fair
maid it is not to record that millstein
aspired to be a don juan unlimited
wealth and early scientific training from
a father famed in research had vested
millstein with every advantage of un-
usual education and physical training
the government had called him before
to destroy plots and intrigues against the
safety of civilization many times he had
thundered on flashing wing to distant
parts of the globe there to solve after
incredible adventures some weird plot
against organized society

  i tell you gentlemen millsteins
voice rang out clear and strong this
looks like the work of the falcon to me
a murmur of excited comment ran
around the table it was quite evident
the group did not share millsteins opin-
ion the latters dark eyes flashed as he
hastened to confirm his theory

  it may sound like a crazy theory to
you gentlemen but you remember that
the falcon has several times before tried

to overthrow our government he-

  who is the falcon interrupted a
voice

  strange you dont know said mill-
stein i thought everyone knew about
the falcon his is a strange tragic story

the velocity of escape



verensky is his name a wealthy russian
scientist he is tall incredibly strong but
of an aesthetic type-a dreamer some
ten years ago in nineteen hundred and
eighty-one to be correct he came to this
country with a great plan for new labora-
tories and scientific development at
that time he was an altruist but the mas-
sive brain contained within his herculean
body became overworked he had trouble
with our own internal revenue depart-
ment that made a heavy income tax lien
against the russian verensky the tax
assessment developed into a battle that
lingered in our supreme courts to make
the story short verensky lost stub-
bornly he refused to pay the amount in-
volved and the revenue department filed
a lien against his immense holdings
finally a part of the russians brain
snapped he became a maniac obsessed
with the idea of overthrowing all forms
of government wedded to the idea of de-
stroying all organized society he disap-
peared for the last ten years no one
has known of his whereabouts but his
evil influence and machinations have been
felt you know full well his handiwork
in the poison fogs that spread over eu-
rope some years ago i had a part in
overcoming that terror you will remem-
ber that the united states air forces co-
operated with me in finding his planes
that were spreading the deadly fogs

yerensky or the falcon as he
 smugly calls himself is a menace to
the world his distorted brain will never
stop working until he has destroyed the
world or has been destroyed himself
you gentlemen remember too the great
panic of nineteen hundred and eighty-
five when the clever falcon devised a
powerful machine that set up peculiar
powerful vibrations to destroy the atomic
structure of gold he built many of
these machines and placed them in the
great financial centers of the world you

recall the horrible panics when the mone-
tary value of gold went to nothing be-
cause the gold stored in vaults banks and
jewelry stores dissolved into a gray pow-
der when it came within the influence of
the disintegrating vibrations each ma-
chine that verensky made had an effec-
tive radius of ten miles

  you perhaps recollect that i was in-
strumental in locating these machines and
destroying them at that time i was
wounded in a duel with the falcon he
was in his fast monoplane we had quite
a dog fight at twenty thousand feet he
shot me in the shoulder and brought me
down about twice a year i receive a
message signed the falcon here let
me read this one that came only a week
ago

  donald millstein had spoken frankly
without any hint of boastfulness the
group knew that millstein was speaking
only the simple truth they waited
eagerly for him to continue millstein
glanced around the assembly as he un-
folded a paper and read

  to my enemy donald millstein
thrice you have thwarted me in my at-
tempt to remove a cruel government from
the earth the falcon is swooping again
beware

  millstein where do you think the fal-
con keeps in hiding 

  i have a theory gentlemen that the
falcon lives in a giant space car far out
beyond the stratascope there his evil
mind plans his schemes of revenge and
he must have a marvelous laboratory and
trained assistants

  but all space ships have been searched
each one is numbered and well known
broke in the stubborn voice again

  quite true agreed donald but re-
member the falcon is a resourceful
genius then too perhaps he lives in
some vast cavern of the earth lately i
have been conducting some experiments
with my radio apparatus to see if i can


amazing stories

locate his sending stations such a scien-
tist as the falcon will of course have
powerful sending and receiving stations
his uncanny wisdom and devilish re-
sources are simply amazing i say this to
you gentlemen i have the feeling that
the falcon is listening to our conversa-
tion this very moment

  an amazed murmur circled the table
and all stared incredulously towards the
young scientist

  now gentlemen as to this terrible
calamity that is before us we have dis-
covered lately that the oxygen surround-
ing the entire earth is becoming diffused
or shall we say thinning out in other
words something is happening to our
oxygen and human life cannot exist
without this precious element in many
sections of the world malignant plagues
of consumption and other lung diseases
are increasing in terrific epidemics even
now in this room all of us are breathing
heavily and swiftly in order to absorb
enough oxygen for our lungs

the three chief gases of our atmos-
 phere are oxygen nitrogen and
water vapor the atoms of oxygen and
nitrogen have plenty of elbow room in
which to dart about although they fre-
quently collide with each other they de-
velop a very great speed we know that
heat is due to the degree of nervousness
of these atoms or groups of atoms the
air that we inhale into our lungs is full
of swiftly moving protons and electrons
let us imagine air one hundred degrees
below zero fahrenheit in this condi-
tion the atomic motions would be very
much more sluggish than they are in the
air we are now breathing stretch our
imaginations a bit further and imagine
the air so cold that electrons did not re-
volve at all this temperature would be
approximately four hundred and sixty-
nine degrees below zero this complete
lack of heat is the absolute zero

  in the case of the atmosphere in this
secret room far below the surfaces of
the earth in the secret tunnels of the
government our temperature is about
thirty-two degrees fahrenheit rather
chilly the small particles of oxygen we
are now breathing are bouncing from one
another with an average speed of about
two miles per second this however is
only the average velocity many atoms
of oxygen strike bounce and rebound
again with a speed many times greater
if we would heat this room up that speed
would increase its a curious fact that
all atoms do not possess the same speed
when heated to the same degree
oxygen nitrogen and water vapor
which as i have stated before are the
chief three gases of our air all behave
about the same on the other hand he-
lium gas atoms will bounce from one
collision to another with about twice their
velocity in fact some helium atoms
have a speed of twenty-five miles per
second a cannon ball goes up in the
air with tremendous force it leaves the
earth at the rate of less than a mile per
second and then because of gravity re-
turns to earth but if the cannon ball
were to be shot into the air with an initial
velocity of about seven miles per second
it would never return for countless
millions of years it might wander through
space like a meteoroid

  now gentlemen im getting to the
point of my theory if a cannon ball
could be shot into the air with a velocity
of more than seven miles per second and
never return to earth what is true of a
cannon ball is also true of an atom if
after thousand and millions of collisions
an atom finds itself in the upper air it
may be going at so great a speed that the
gravity of earth cannot recall it earth
is so large that no atom can bounce away
unless it has a speed of more than seven
miles a second our most valuable gases
oxygen nitrogen and water vapor are
the velocity of escape



slow and seldom exceed that critical
speed

  even at the temperature at which
water freezes a hydrogen atom has an
average speed of more than seven miles
per second and of course many hydro-
gen atoms would have a far greater speed
to illustrate more clearly let us consider
the planet mercury a cannon ball with
the velocity of only two miles per sec-
ond would leave that planet forever this
state of affairs is due to the smallness of
mercury its gravity force is so slight
that a body would fall only four feet dur-
ing the first second the blinding sun-
light of mercury would make an oxygen
atom nervous its excitable nature
would cause billions of its comrades to
dart about collide and bounce at a speed
much in excess of two miles per second
thus it wras that mercury lost its pre-
cious air countless millions of years ago
even lost all the gases which from time
to time have been emitted by its vol-
canos

  on the planet mars an atom of air
would only have to possess the velocity
of more than three miles per second to
bounce away and never return on
venus the velocity of escape is ap-
proximately seven miles

  i cannot understand interrupted one
of the scientists what this has to do
with the falcon

tt means just this continued mill-

  i stein verensky is a most danger-
ous criminal an insane man obsessed with
the idea of wiping out the earth you
must not underrate his powers in some
manner this insane genius has developed
a process perhaps a machine that emits
exciting rays that increase the speed of
the atoms of oxygen causing them to act
as the hypothetical cannon ball already
my laboratories are conducting tests

you mean broke in doctor benson
a famous scholar that our oxygen

is flying away from the earth
that is exactly what i mean insisted
millstein perhaps its been going on
for a year or more and as you know we
are just beginning to feel the horrible
effect of the thinning out process of the
air

  a tall figure at the head of the table
rose the president of the united states
up to this time that leader of a mighty
nation had not spoken his calm yes
swept over the gathering

  donald millstein i have listened and
believe in your theory before in emer-
gencies the government has called and
depended upon you i ask you to take
full charge of this investigation the
government is behind you i am remem-
bering at this moment your past services
and pledge you unlimited support what
can the government do to help you

  it was typical of millstein that he ig-
nored completely the fine compliment and
praise from the greatest man in the land
his whole mind was concentrated to the
task of solving the mighty problem peo-
ple all over the world gasping for breath
were breathing his name their words a
hopeful prayer

  mr president i thank you and i will
call upon your department of chemistry
and science for their best man and if an
idea i have proves to have merit i shall
ask you for power to call out the space
fighters of our air navy

   it is granted stated the president

atomic solar systems

don millstein left the meet-
ing and was carried in a fast
government automobile to the
nearest flying field where he had left his
special plane millstein was most cour-
ageous but the iron-nerved secret service
operator who tooled the powerful ar-


amazing stories

mored car through washington traffic
gave don many a thrill a few moments
at the airport and millstein was thunder-
ing through the air at three hundred miles
per hour

  three hours later he was in his won-
derful laboratory well hidden among
bleak vermont hills jack cromwell
trusted assistant who always accom-
panied millstein on desperate flights and
dangerous espionage was waiting anx-
iously

  glad to see you millstein were
getting a mysterious message on the radio
thats intended for you its been repeated
several times and who do you think is
sending it t

  the falcon t

  yes chief and heres what he says
never mind what he says jack go
back to the radio and see if you can find
if the message is coming from near-by
or from space wait a minute what
does the message say

  jack cromwell flashed an amused grin
as he read aloud from a slip of paper

  to donald millstein beware my
enemy do not attempt to thwart my
plans from the falcon

  that settles it stated millstein
theres no doubt of it the falcon is
back of this terrible oxygen starvation
after you work with the radio come to
the laboratory you and i are going to
do some microscopic work

  for many hours millstein and his
trained assistants did not rest involved
experiments were conducted tired
weary eyes strained through powerful
lenses from time to time millstein
whose eyes were fairly glued to his in-
strument would call out details and in-
structions to his assistants

  come here cromwell from mill-
stein after a long studied silence look
at these films weve developed

  a microscopic motion picture projec-
tion machine was fitted up and so fo-

cussed and arranged that the diminutive
solar system of an atom of oxygen was
thrown on the screen the projection
machine was then slowed down so that it
barely revolved during the taking of the
pictures the camera had been operated
at a fearful velocity a most remarkable
miniature solar system was projected on
the screen worlds-planets revolving
about each other in fixed orbits

  in spite of the fact that the machine
had slowed down their movements by
many thousand times always the whirl-
ing pairs of the electrons fairly raced on
the screen

  there you are cromwell look at
that small solar system all by itself a
nucleus of oxygen see how the electrons
fairly whirl much too fast for normal
oxygen some kind of ray or a magnetic
or electrical influence is increasing the
normal speed of the oxygen atoms

  well mused jack who always saw
humor in every situation perhaps the
falcon has done something to set them
on a spree

  whatever it is jack its most seri-
ous the world is about to be deprived
of its oxygen and will soon become a
dead hopeless sphere- as you perhaps
know oxygen is the eighth element its
atomic number is eight and its atomic
weight is sixteen therefore each nu-
cleus of oxygen has eight free or orbital
electrons and eight bound electrons

  there are only a few of the known
elements that are so exactly and evenly
divided as to free electrons and bound
electrons perhaps this is the reason that
it is possible for the falcon to accelerate
by some means the speed of the electrons
in this element

py the way cromwell did i ever
d give you this very important rule 
to discover the make-up of any element
take the full number of the atomic
weight that represents the number of
the velocity of escape



protons in the nucleus for instance gold
has one hundred and ninety-seven of
them now the number of free electrons
is represented by the atomic number in
this case of gold seventy-nine the nu-
cleus therefore consists of one hundred
and ninety-seven protons of the elec-
trons within an atom of gold seventy-
nine would be free or orbital electrons
while one hundred and eighteen would be
bound electrons

  trained assistants at millsteins direc-
tion next placed an atom of oxygen so
that it could be bombarded with high volt-
age this device called an alpha ray
machine projected charges of several
million volts of potential directly into the
little solar system of the oxygen nucleus

  millstein worn and tired sighed at the
result

   its no use its not electricity that is
speeding up the atoms see that little
solar system was exploded in a normal
manner and we know for certain that
its not a rise of temperature thats
affecting their speed lets try a mag-
netic influence

  it took hours to make this test but it
revealed nothing the orbital electrons
of the oxygen atoms performed normally
except that they continued to rotate at
their mad unusual speed

  do you suppose from cromwell in
a studied tone that the positive and
negative charges of the electrons have
been reversed by some means

  i thought of that replied millstein
its my theory that if charges were re-
versed the atoms would not have acted
as they did under the test of the voltage
bombardment no-its not that

  just then there was an interruption
from a trusted assistant

  mr millstein here is a very impor-
tant message that just came from govern-
ment headquarters

  bad news chief asked jack anx-
iously

  yes it is millsteins face was
slightly pale this message from the
government states that thousands are
dying in the regions of high altitudes
urges me to speed up investigation the
message is more of a prayer than a com-
mand i tell you jack things are des-
perate im certain now that the falcon
is back of all of this by the way jack
when his message came in on the radio
do you think the sending station was
close or far

  it must have been from a great dis-
tance for the reception wavered and was
very faint until i amplified it and it had
a great deal of static

  for a moment millstein remained si-
lent then a light broke over his face

  do you know jack i believe that if
we could find the falcon and net him
this problem might be solved by jove
im sure hes sending those messages
from space ill bet he has a space car of
immense size and practically lives in it
thats why the best brains in the world
have been unable to find him

  great cosmos shot out cromwell
do you mean to say that one scientific
crook can lick the whole world 
millstein sprang erect with an excited
exclamation as cromwell spoke

 cosmos why do you say cos-
mos dont you get it cosmic
rays millsteins voice rose to a high
excited pitch as he went on cosmic
rays are considered by some scientists to
be the signals sent out through the ether
announcing the continuous creation of the
heavier metals out of the lighter many
years ago it was thought that cosmic rays
originated from the fierce energy of the
sun generated in that mighty globe of
gas by the exploding atoms that provide
its boundless energy later it was found
however when machines called electro-
scopes were lowered into deep lakes that
the cosmic rays still had their effect this


amazing stories

machine was originally designed by the
famous dr robert a millikan his ap-
paratus was composed of delicate quartz
fibers so arranged that when the fibers
were charged with one kind of electricity
they would repel and remain apart but
as soon as the cosmic rays influenced
them penetrating the shell of the electro-
scope the electrical charge of the fibers
was knocked off in proportion to the
effect of the rays causing the quartz
fibers to come close together then by
measuring the rate of the collapse of the
fibers and the discharge of the electricity
from them the great millikan was able
to prove the strength of cosmic rays at
any moment he made the astounding
discover that these rays have the same
effect at night as in the daytime thus
proving that the rays do not originate
from the mighty energy of the sun

  millikan also found out in his experi-
ments that some rays were more pene-
trating than others which proved that
cosmic rays had different characteristics
tests showed that some of these rays
could pass through seventeen feet of
lead owing to the research of the mag-
nificent scientist it was decided that cos-
mic rays came from interstellar space
later with millikan still laboring at his
devices it was discovered that the cosmic
rays are divided very distinctly into sev-
eral distinct bands or groups of the spec-
trum then it was proven that each of
the spectrum bands of the cosmic rays
corresponds to the production of a par-
ticular kind of atom as when the atoms
of helium gas are being built in sky space
there is released a definite band of cosmic
rays called the helium cosmic ray bands
again when an oxygen atom is being
made another sort of cosmic ray is dis-
charged the generation of silicon and
iron atoms causes the emission of very
different and distinct ray bands

  now nitrogen and carbon are so close
to oxygen in their atomic pattern the

structure of their electrons within each of
their atoms that the cosmic rays due to
their atom building are included in the
oxygen cosmic rays so you see crom-
well it may be that the study of nitrogen
and carbon will help us to solve the secret
mystery

e must look into an atom of hy-
drogen hydrogen atoms are the
fundamental bricks of the physical uni-
verse they are the lightest of any atom
and the simplest in construction the
simplest of all elements is hydrogen gas
in which one electron revolves around a
nucleus of one proton let us compare
this atom of hydrogen gas to a solar sys-
tem that consisted of just the sun and
mercury

  they would be approximately the same
as to their relative sizes distances apart
rotations and orbits

  but to make this short you know that
scientists found only a few years ago that
the cosmic rays are photons such as
light and x-rays rather than electrons
and that the cosmic rays are not gen-
erated in the local astronomical com-
plexes-the solar system and the milky
way-but are born from atomic disturb-
ances in the unknown space regions mil-
lions of light years away

  cromwell had been gazing at millstein
in adoration during the technical dis-
course

  he suddenly spoke

  chief i believe youve got it

  the falcon is fooling with the cosmic
rays

  yes muttered millstein his mind
filled with a thousand details were
going to fly back to washington at once
then were taking my space ship ne-
mesis out into space were going to
look for the falcon

  hes doing something to the cosmic
days and that is causing all of the
trouble that is over us

chapter iii

the space trail

jack cromwell was an excel-
lent pilot and while they were fly-
ing back to the government port for
space ships millstein managed to get two
needed hours of sleep it was well that
cromwell was a skilled pilot and that the
sturdy little plane was equipped with a
very powerful motor for he found diffi-
culty in maintaining any safe altitude
in the thin air finally however after
making proper signals they circled and
came to a perfect three-point landing

  for miles great hangars stretched
towering high in the air great steel
towers rose at different places these
towers were built for the launching of
space ships these elongated derricks
acted as guides to launch space ships into
the blue vault of the sky

  while flying from their laboratory
cromwell at millsteins direction had
radioed ahead to government headquar-
ters requesting that two of the finest and
fastest united states space fighters be
assigned to millstein the government
had wired back its instant approval with
the information that the two ships and
crews would be ready when millstein
arrived

  the scientist and his assistant were
soon in the great hangar that housed
millsteins personal space ship the nem-
esis millstein had spent years de-
veloping the space ship the fastest
man-made thing that ever rocketed
through space the craft possessed new
and strange powerful weapons that
were known only to millstein and a few
of his highly trusted assistants many
times he had used this craft on dangerous
interplanetary expeditions and it was a
mark of distinction and favor that he
could house his private ship at the gov-
ernment port

   in the control room millstein gave out
detailed instructions while the ship was
being checked with painstaking care
millstein was in a studious mood

  you know after all jack he said
quite dubiously were going out on
rather a wild goose chase its just a
hunch

   somehow i feel chief that were on
the right track your hunches never
fail

  word came that the two government
scouts were ready to take off any second
millstein connected to the two govern-
ment space ships by radio telephone gave
them detailed instructions as to their
flight and course then he turned his
eyes to the control board of his space
car his hands lovingly caressed the
levers instruments and gauges as a
skilled artist at a piano

  ready snapped millstein in the
mouthpiece of the phone

   with a careful glance at the gauge he
pulled a lever the top of the great
hangar opened up and a steel guide slid
noiselessly high into the air a guide such
as a tremendous sky rocket would use for
its initial impetus

  power snapped millstein pulling
another lever for a moment the two
felt as though some relentless force was
squeezing their bodies to an unbearable
degree acceleration was taking its toll

   well jack were beyond the strata-
scope do you realize that it did not take
as much power as usual to leave the
atmosphere it must be thinning very
rapidly

   what are your plans

   i have a theory that if the falcon is
in some way affecting the cosmic rays
then he will be only a few thousand miles
from the surface of the earth so ill tell
you what im going to do im going to
start making circles around the earth at
about one thousand miles from its sur-
face our first circle well make at a


amazing stories

velocity of five thousand miles per hour
then well proceed outward to an addi-
tional one thousand miles from the sur-
face of the earth and circle the globe
again next time well run the speed up
to ten thousand miles per hour dont
you see jack that if we keep circling
the globe and gradually work outward
increasing the velocity of our flight i
figure that in twenty hours well have
reached a point where the falcon might
be located this way we cannot miss
him provide the men in the forward
lookouts with the high-powered tele-
scopes and tell them to search the heav-
ens at all times keep our best men at
the radio detectors to see if they can lo-
cate any ship well investigate every
ship we meet i have full government
authority and the government has asked
the other planets to cooperate in our need
venus has agreed to have her space craft
investigated

  chief its a big job to search the
whole universe

  that fiend is some place in our own
planetary system insisted millstein reso-
lutely and im going to find him

hours passed and the nemesis
was many thousand miles from die
earth which now glowed like a moon
both jack and millstein had obtained a
needed rest leaving the control of the
ship to efficient officers

  cromwell are the two government
ships keeping in close contact with us
yes chief theyre directly in our
rear number seven-h-five is a hundred
miles to our right and number seven-h-
six is two hundred miles in the rear to
the left we are at all times in constant
communication with them they report
that their ships are operating in wonder-
ful shape but say theyre running at full
power of their atomic tubes to keep up
with us we cant increase our speed un-
less vve want to leave the ships behind

  do you know cromwell there was
a mysterious light in millsteins eyes i
love my nemesis i believe she is the
fastest thing that was ever built by man
some day im going to build a projec-
tile that will fly at the speed of light
but no one will ever be able to fly
at the speed of light for you know that
einstein that great scientist who lived
many years ago was the first to discover
that if an object were to travel at the
speed of light it would cease to exist
how can anything cease to exist
argued millstein theres no limit to
the smallness of things as there is no
limit to the largeness of things you and
i know were now traveling at a velocity
that in a slight degree reduces our size
that we possessed on earth we dont
feel any discomfort and i believe that
when man comes to travel at the speed of
light he will continue to diminish in size
but will suffer no ill effect and not realize
the difference his surroundings would be
proportionately decreased in mass
youre talking too deep for me
chief but say theres one thing i do
want to know youve been working for
months on this ship secretly installing
some new weapons tell me about them
this craft already had the most pow-
erful armament in the universe

  im glad you mentioned that crom-
well heres a little device thats going
to spring a surprise on the falcon it
has sights like the turret guns of the old
obsolete battleships when these levers
are moved a tube is thrust from the nose
of our ship and can be pointed at any
other space ship or object in space by
merely aligning the pointer on this
smoked glass against the reflected object
vry ingenious agreed cromwell
but what good does it do t

  well its connected to powerful
motors and transformers in the engine
rooms of our ship when you pull this
lever millstein indicated a small lever
the velocity of escape



like a trigger of the obsolete colt  it
releases a ray that literally bathes itself
over any space ship at which it might be
pointed this energy ray reverses the
direction of the flow of electrical energy
through the protons and electrons in any
element it caresses it will disintegrate
some of the denser metals almost in-
stantly setting up a disoontented ele-
ment condition among the electrons and
protons such as exists in radium except
that the process of disintegration would
be greatly speeded naturally too it
would have the lesser but devastating ef-
fect of instantly burning out all the
enemys electrical circuits and motors-
radios-in fact all electrical equipment i
am anxious to try this device out on the
falcon cromwell there was no place
on earth i could make a safe test without
damaging too much surface

  well exclaimed cromwell wide-
eyed you have got a surprise for the
falcon i dont know what earth would
have done the last ten years without your
talent youve developed practically
every new weapon they have

ever mind the bouquets i want
to tell you about this weapon
here said millstein pointing to a device
the controls of which were similar to the
first this operates in practically the
same manner except that i call it my
expansion ray wrhen its fearful energy
floods itself over any element it causes
the orbits of the electrons within that
element to suddenly enlarge the circles of
their orbits many million times this of
course has the same effect as an explo-
sion of tnt unfortunately so far
ive been unable to affect anything but
the electrons within an iron nucleus but
of course almost every metal in a space
ship has some iron in its composition
so if we can maneuver our projection
tubes to bathe this ray over a space ship
and explode all the billions of iron nuc-

leuses within that space ship the whole
structure is certain to fall apart

  but there are lots of elements used in
a space ship such as copper aluminum
lead and others argued cromwell
these have no iron in their composition
yes agreed millstein but all those
elements are always fastened to steel
which has iron content think of the
steel shell of a space ship going to pieces
youre right the expansion ray is
going to be tough for the enemy have
you any other nice little things up your
sleeve 

  just two more answered millstein
this third device which points its pro-
jection tube similar to the others i have
explained shoots out vibrations which
travel on a beam of light when this
beam carrying the deadly rays strikes a
space ship it has a powerful effect on
the atomic structure of all elements i
dont know just how i discovered it
stumbled on it quite by accident but
this ray combined with the vibration in-
stantly stops the orbits of electrons in
any element this of course produces
close to absolute zero and unless the oc-
cupants of a space car had something to
overcome these rays they would be frozen
instantly

  youve been working lately why
have you been keeping these things
secret

  i wanted to have a chance to try
them first

  well grinned cromwell lets find
the falcon and test em out whats the
other pop-gun you were talking about
this apparatus produces vibrations so
shrill and intensely rapid they will pene-
trate many feet of most elements and
instantly paralyze the brain of any human
or living creature i have managed to
project it on a beam of light and by
turning this other switch i can produce
the vibrations all around our space ship
but of course in using this latter method


amazing stories

 the vibrations weaken very rapidly as
 they widen into space this device is a
 last card to play suppose for instance
 we could succeed in darting our ship close
 to ail enemy and flooded them with these
 vibrations i calculate that this weapon
 will be active up to a ten mile radius
 around our ship

   ive heard enough technical stuff
 begged cromwell youve got my brain
 going around in a whirl how far are
 we now from earth

   weve made our tenth revolution
 stated millstein and were only a hun-
 dred thousand miles from earth lets
 step into the observation room the
 heavens are unusually clear no cosmic
 clouds perhaps we can do a bit of adven-
 turing with the telescopes

   the two seated themselves in comfort-
 able chairs their eyes adjusted to power-
 ful glasses

   theres a sight for you crom-
 well look at that smaller group of
 the clouds of magellan those billions of
 stars are a hundred thousand light years
 away from earth they appear as a
 little cloud that had blown away from
 the milky way once i was on an expe-
  dition at the south pole and on very
 clear nights that group was visible to the
 naked eye if all the lights in that group
 were concentrated in one point they
 would be about as bright as the north
 star their faintness is due to the enor-
 mous distance yet thousands of stars in
 that cloud of billions of stars are two
 hundred thousand times brighter than our
 sun if the sun suddenly acquired such
 brightness all life on earth would be
 instantly burnt to a crisp or the earth
 and all on it might be vaporized

   very interesting snorted cromwell
 but were out here to find the falcon
 oh i know youre anxious for a
 genuine scrap but that will come soon

enough theres a sight you mustnt miss
-the great star cluster of hercules let
me point your glass what a magnificent
sight from earth these thousands and
thousands of stars that make up the clus-
tre of hercules appear as a single very
blurred star just think jack the light
by which we see these stars at this mo-
ment left the cluster before the cro-
magnon race entered europe and began
to draw his wonderful pictures of bison
and horses in the famous caves of france
the light thats leaving that cluster now
and starting  its long journey towards
earth will meet our remote descendants
in the year thirty-eight thousand i won-
der jack what kind of a wonderful race
those light beams from hercules will
find

  i suppose its hopeless to try and get
you to talk about anything but scientific
things sighed cromwell id rather
talk about the falcon cromwell knew
even though millstein was discoursing on
scientific matters of a technical nature
that his keen brain was shrewdly analyz-
ing and testing every theory relating to
the problem at hand this was their tra-
ditional way of working together on a
difficult problem cromwell had learned
by long experience to fall into millsteins
mood it seemed to stimulate the scien-
tists brain to give out information

  say chief in the laboratory the other
day you spoke about photons what are
photons 

  well cromwell i guess youve got
me cornered at last ive said enough to
you about cosmic rays for one time but
photons are closely associated with cosmic
rays light and color we scientists are
still groping at the bottom of a vast sea
of yet undiscovered wonders the sim-
plest way to put it would be to say that
photons sometimes called quanta are
a series of light waves consisting of
countless billions and billions of tiny bul-
lets of energy laboratory experiments
the velocity of escape



have proven that the difference between
violet and red color is in the number of
microscopic waves of light which enter
your eyes in a second of time if seven
hundred and fifty-six millions of millions
enter your eyes in a second your nerves
are affected in such a way that you call
the sensation violet these waves cannot
be seen in a microscope for your edifi-
cation my embryo scientist the number
of waves per inch in each color in the
rainbow has been counted fifty-five
thousand waves to the inch give us the
sensation of blue forty-eight thousand
vibrations green forty-four thousand
yellow thirty-eight thousand red when
the waves become so long that less than
about thirty-three thousand occur we
would be unable to see them for exam-
pie alcohol flame does not send out waves
that can make any but a minute impres-
sion on the nerves of the eyes invisible
light also comes at the other extreme the
ultra-violet where the waves are so short
and crowded together they dont give our
eyes any sensation at all you can com-
pare this to the piercing shrieks of some
laboratory apparatus or some insects that
produce vibrations so shrill that they
dont affect our eardrums at all if the
waves of color are so short it takes over
sixty-six thousand of them to make an
inch they are totally invisible to our eyes
and are called ultra-violet

  thus it has been that scientists
searching the void with their telescopes
have been able to tell from the various
colors of the spectrum out in space just
how the cosmic rays are vibrating and
what particular element is being born in
the cold spaces temperatures of the sun
ind stars are thus readily determined
for many colors invisible to the naked
eye can be detected and classified in the
laboratory

  it is doubtful whether cromwell had
been listening to this technical discourse
suddenly his body stiffened

reat scott millstein what
is that great white mass to the
right it looks like someone had poured
a gob of sour milk in a bowl of thick
chocolate and then stirred it violently

  millstein did not reply for some time
finally he spoke with a chuckle in his
voice

  that group of stars jack is the great
nebula of andromeda its barely visi-
ble from the earth and considering our
own planetary system its incomprehen-
sibly prodigious in size that nebula is
forty-five thousand light years in diam-
eter and a million light years from the
earth scientists believe that the nebulas
of the sky such as the nebula of andro-
meda and the great whirlpool of canis
venatici are vast whirlpools or mael-
stroms of stars planets moons and suns
of uncountable numbers perhaps some
near celestial collision distorted them to
the spiral shapes but unlike a whirlpool
the stars are not moving toward the cen-
ter observations of many years indicate
that they are travelling out from the cen-
ter as the entire group revolves around
its nucleus nebulas are one of the un-
solved mysteries of the universe

  a phone buzzed at millsteins elbow
and for a moment he listened intently
his eyes took on a keen glitter

  well jack i guess your wish has
come true lookout number seven in
the port bow states he has sighted an
immense object about five hundred miles
straight ahead on our course lets go
back to the control room number seven
says that the object is apparently a space
ship because of its cylindrical shape but
that its nearly a mile in length thats
just the sort of a craft the falcon would
have

  they repaired quickly to the compli-
cated control room with its thousands of
reflectoscopes gauges and instruments
and seated themselves at their respective
controls this room was the heart of the


amazing stories

swift little space fighter millstein was
always in direct communication with every
part of the ship cromwell always effi-
cient adjusted one of the reflectoscopes
so that the area of the newly discovered
space ship showed on the screen in front
of him he started back in surprise as
the image of a mighty space vessel was
reflected on the glass

  ill say its a mile long chief it must
be the falcon who ever heard of a ship
so vast in proportions 

  millstein did not hear or at least he
did not heed for he was phoning to the
radio room

  send a message to the strange ship
give the customary salute ask their
name and from what planet and their
destination make it plain that we are on
government duty and mean business

  all the while the nemesis was slip-
ping through space with incredible speed
pressing a button millstein spoke into
another receiver this time he was con-
nected with the power rooms of the ship
here were located the apparatus that
broke up atoms of mercury transform-
ing the energy of whirling electrons into
enormous power converted electrons
were discharged through the impellant
tubes in the rear and nose of the fighter
the converted electrons roared out into
space through the tubes with vast en-
ergy forcing the space ship in any de-
sired direction at least they would have
roared had there been any atmosphere to
convey the vibrations of sound but in
space all is silence

  slow down the ship to barely cruising
speed circle the stranger at five hundred
miles distance radio the two govern-
ment scouts of our discovery tell them
to keep circling till further orders wait
heres something cromwell

  with agile fingers millstein arranged
levers and his phone connection so that
he was receiving direct a message coming
from the ether a taut but amused grin

spread over his countenance cromwell
stared with wondering eyes he knew his
chief was receiving some highly impor-
tant news finally an impetuous nature
could restrain itself no longer

hat is it chief  what are you
getting

  oh nothing much chuckled mill-
stein just a friendly little message from
the falcon the strange space ship is
the avenger so the falcon calls it he
sighted us and is warning me to stay
away

  what does he say burst out crom-
well

  wait a minute snapped millstein
then into the mouthpiece of the phone
turn on all protective rays full power
we may be subject to attack at any mo-
ment then turning to cromwell the
falcon says about as follows ive lo-
cated you millstein and your three ships
ill give you just five minutes to leave
this part of space or ill blast you out of
existence ive some new weapons to try
out 

  yes and weve got soroe new weapons
to try out also broke in cromwell now
ready for fight

  just then the nemesis shuddered
through its tough steel frame the air
vibrated and there was the faint odor of
short-circuited electrical current

  treachery just as i thought
snapped millstein he is trying out
some sort of a deadly ray on us didnt
even give us the five minutes but our
protective screen rays are working fine

  look shouted cromwell pointing to
the screen in front of them look at
the government scout ship

  like a tragedy unfolded on a motion
picture screen a horrible catastrophe was
disclosed to the two the leading gov-
ernment space fighter that was next to
the nemesis had suddenly exploded
with fearful force its millions of frag-
the velocity of escape



ments were streaming in all directions
through space there the fragments
would drift for millions of years to be-
come satellites to the planet earth

   its a light to the death snarled
 millstein this time the falcon will not
 escape - think of all those poor devils in
  the government scout jack radio the
 other scout to retreat a thousand miles
 their protective screens are not as strong
 as ours and no doubt the falcon has in-
 vented some new deadly weapon

   no use chief muttered cromwell
 after a busy moment our radio room
 says the other scout doesnt answer
 look cromwells finger pointed to the
 screen in front of them the other gov-
 ernment ship is disabled its darting for-
 ward out of control

 xes muttered millstein anxiously
 i by some devilish means the falcon
 has paralyzed or killed every human life
 on the fighter thank heavens we have
 better types of protective screens on this
 craft

   yes but our power rooms report that
 all dynamos and machines are being badly
 affected perhaps wed better fly off a
 few thousand miles and reconnoiter
 this was cromwells way of taunting
 millstein to start the combat

   retreat grated millstein ill say
 we wont lets go heres where we
 fight to the finish

chapter iv

the battle of space

 but millstein did flash away a thou-
 sand miles from the other ship
 where he knew the vibrations and
 rays of the avengers weapons would
 be lessened in power but it was not a
 retreat merely a strategic move to gain
 time for planning and to study the enemy
 with powerful telescopes

  it is difficult to describe a battle of
space ships such encounters are strange-
ly unlike the dog-fights of airplanes that
circle each other with vicious machine
guns spewing out lead and death space
ships in combat circle and dart about each
other a thousand miles apart testing the
others protective screens with destruc-
tive rays and rending vibrations they
circle and pi tinge about each other like
boxers trying to exhaust the power of
the others weapons strange weapons
those rays that burn and explode atoms
vibrations that disintegrate metals rays
of light carrying sudden heat that melt
steels like butter

   millstein realized he possessed the fast-
est ship and could thus maneuver more
quickly in his wisdom and experience
he also knew his immense enemy had
more power in other words more ergs
of energy to hurl at him per minute in
various forms millsteins position might
be compared to that of a very skilled
swordsman armed with a light rapier
pitted against a herculean athlete armed
with a heavy cutlass

  millstein and cromwell were both in
their element neither spoke every
sense was concentrated on their great
task-to annihilate the falcon every
nerve on edge every cell of their brains
alert messages were coming to them
constantly from the various departments
of the ship their eyes turned from
gauges to instruments and to the screens
that were constantly and adroitly turned
by cromwell to reflect that portion of
space occupied by the falcon

  give them a shot from one of our
rays pleaded cromwell

  no not yet theyre using lots of
power now did you feel that for a
moment my senses fairly reeled i won-
der what strange weapon the falcon is
trying out on us look it even affects
the space compasses see how they vi-
brate and oscillate then into one of the
vo

amazing stories

phones connected to the power room
bill throw on every atom of power
youve got on all protective screens
were being bombarded

  then to cromwells supreme disgust
millstein ordered the ship into a man-
euver that flung it away from the scene
of conflict a full five hundred miles at
such a speed the acceleration was very
painful

  say what the-

  cromwells voice was cut off as he
gasped for breath for millstein had
stopped the ship so suddenly that de-
celeration almost pushed their bodies
through the instrument table then quick
orders and the ship turned in space so
abruptly that their bodies seemed flat-
tened out millstein the master pilot
the fighter of spaces was at his best for
with full speed and the maximum endur-
able rate of acceleration the nemesis
plunged toward the falcon

  are we going to ram him

  no shot out millstein but im go-
ing to show you some action get ready
jack were going to give him a taste of
my new ray number one

  yes muttered cromwell in delight
fingering the controls of that deadly wea-
pon already he had aligned the muzzle
of the tube that projected the deadly rays
that would reverse the direction of elec-
tricity in its energy flow in any metal
that the ray encountered

  wait shouted millstein with one of
his sudden inspirations that come to such
geniuses in moments of stress and dan-
ger i believe jack that hes tried that
same weapon on us so he must have
built up a protective screen give him
ray number two the disintegrator

  it was but the work of a second for
cromwell to align the tubes of the dis-
integration ray by use of the screen show-
ing so clearly the position of the aven-
ger an observer seated in the control
room of that marvelous space fighter

would not have realized except for the
tense and slightly excited mood of the
two men that a terrific battle of incredi-
ble energies and super-wits was taking
place except of course from the distress
of sudden acceleration and deceleration
caused by the diving and swooping of
the craft the sharp commands of mill-
stein into the various phones and the
lightning-like play of the pairs agile fin-
gers like skilled operators at some vast
switchboard

  countless billion ergs of energy were
expended by the two space fighters de-
structive energies conveyed on deadly
rays to be partly absorbed dissipated or
turned aside by protective vibration
screens the ancient thor of mytholog-
ical tradition hurling his thunderbolts of
lightning would have gloried in such a
conflict

et ready ordered millstein
when i say the word bathe them
with the ray

  they were flashing ten thousand miles
an hour toward the avenger not
much time had elapsed since millstein had
turned the ship for his daring attack but
their brains and fingers worked with in-
credible speed and to the two highly
trained men the swift seconds were long
millstein carefully watching the gauges
that indicated the strength of the rays
and vibrations of the enemys weapons
shrewdly waited until there was slight
pause in the power registered on the
instruments

  now jack give it to them wrell
flash by within fifty miles

  cromwell carefully moved the sighting
apparatus keeping it aligned with the
enemy ship comparatively simple that
pointing it would have appeared to a
casual observer for the image of the
enemy ship appeared on the smoked glass
screen of the reflectoscope before crom-
well and he had apparently but to point
the velocity of escape



an indicator like tracing a line to keep
his ray guns aligned rut in spite of the
apparent simplicity there was an infinite
skill and detail a precise accuracy accom-
plished by cromwell he was the best
ray-pointer of space his keen brown
eyes held the light of some religious de-
votee as his agile fingers moved indica-
tor and levers

  good work cromwell i believe
youve hit them hard the gauges show-
ing the power of their weapons are regis-
tering nothing maybe weve disabled
them i dont know though were up
against the shrewdest brain all the uni-
verse it may be a trick

  again that strange intuitive sense of
warning came to millstein and in a sud-
den decision he turned the ship and shot
away with a frightful velocity that tested
even the skill of cromwell to keep the
ray tubes aligned on the other ship

  then a most amazing near-catastrophe
occurred on the screen before them
appeared the government space ship that
had dashed off into space coming straight
toward them it was only by an insanely
quick maneuver that millstein avoided the
berserk craft

  great scott muttered millstein
did you see that cromwell the gov-
ernment ship is running amuck radio
officers says they dont reply to our sig-
nals the ship is circling the heavens in
weird uncontrolled circles at full velocity
ive an idea the falcon has devised
some sort of a devilish ray or vibration
that has made the commander and men
of the ship insane perhaps he has gained
control of their minds by some hypnosis
or mental projection and caused the gov-
ernment commander to think were his
enemy you know the falcon is an adept
in mental control watch carefully
cromwell the government space ship
tried to ram us we have two ships to
fight now we have-

  millsteins voice trailed off as the air

about them fairly crackled with some
fierce energy the gauges registered
crazily and some showed no reading
whatever with a great mental struggle
millstein roused himself and hastily
slapped cromwell smartly on either side
of his face

  snap into it cromwell we didnt
hurt the falcon much he just gave us
a sample of some new horrible weapon
do you know i believe he has fumbled on
my idea of the vibration ray carried along
a stream of light im still tingling

tm okay now chief but i feel as

  a though a million hornets had stung
me

  millstein noted with great relief that
the instruments were now registering
normally and again he turned the ship
to swoop toward the falcon they had
rocketed away from the enemy a full two
thousand miles in the last maneuver

  for a few minutes he drove his attack
at an angle

  keep a sharp lookout for the crazy
government ship telephoned millstein
to another part of the space ship keep
full power on all protective screens
have the emergency crew inspect the en-
tire ship and report back give me report
on our energy-storage and let each man
be prepared against unusual body
stresses

  as they neared the avenger the
nemesis began to shudder the air to
vibrate and for a few moments millstein
studied the gauges carefully

  well heres something cromwell
that will delight your heart the energy
rays of the avengers weapons are not
registering so strongly we are depleting
even their vast power plants of course
it may be a trick

  careful shouted cromwell there
comes the government scout again ap-
proaching us from the rear twenty-five
degrees to the starboard


amazing stories

  again it took all of the shrewd and
trained flying instinct of millstein to
avoid the plunging government scout

  theres no question about it the
falcon has obtained mental control of the
government scout our disintegration ray
is a failure apparently the falcon has
some sort of a screen wait here comes
a message from number ten power room
great scott cromwell engineer kelly
reports three of his men have suddenly
gone crazy and he has had to knock them
out with a paralyzing ray pistol dont
you see jack the cursed fiend has de-
vised some way to shoot a ray of energy
that affects ones mentality in some mys-
terious way the falcon can project his
evil mind and dominate that of a weaker
one well here goes

  with that millstein became a fiend him-
self a madman obsessed with the idea
of removing this menace to civilization
the fast space ship dove and plunged
and shot out deadly rays at its larger
enemy many times it barely avoided the
plunging rushes of the government scout
millstein spoke no word his fingers
played over the instrument with incredi-
ble speed and certainty all weapons
were brought into play and with incom-
prehensible skill the larger ship was
bathed and bombarded with every kind
of destructive ray of vibration heat and
energy it was plain that the enormous
power of the avenger was growing
weaker finally after hours of risky
daring evolutions and shrewd dodging of
the whirling government scout ship mill-
stein glanced at cromwell there was a
strained expression on millsteins face
the look of an athlete winning a mara-
thon race but not finished for in the
coal black eyes there was implacable de-
termination don millstein was not
defeated

romwell his voice was almost
mechanical in its coldness and

tenseness weve just one more card to
play ill dive close to the falcon at full
speed as i come to within one hundred
miles ill start to make a swooping orbit
around his ship

  one hundred miles exclaimed crom-
well thats too close chief we-

  we have only one shot left in our
locker interrupted millstein my three
new weapons have failed even the beam
of rays that slow up the electronic speed
within atoms to produce absolute zero
i had counted on that weapon

  going to give them number four
chief the shrill sound vibrations
yes snarled millstein thats the
reason i want to go that close to make
the force as strong as possible i dont
think the falcon has thought of this
weapon

  the daring evolution was safely exe-
cuted although the sturdy little craft
trembled and vibrated with the power of
destructive rays in which it was literally
bathed by the avenger as it circled at
full speed

  it was characteristic of millstein when
he looked up after shooting away to a
safer distance although his last weapon
had failed that there was no discourage-
ment on his lean face

  well jack the falcon had even
thought of that he has a protective
screen against our sound vibrations and
it must be a good one

  cromwell brave as theseus slaying
the minotaur spoke without a tremor in
his voice

  chief lets ram them

  for a moment millstein sat silent con-
sidering mightily

  no jack that wont do ive an
idea you know in my past encounters
with the falcon i have discovered his
one weak point i mean his egotistical
pride he is vain and boastful of his
physical valour he is a mighty man in
strength and thinks that he can outdo any
the velocity of escape



other human with primitive weapons i
believe i can trap him

  what are you going to do asked
cromwell in an awed voice

  im going to challenge him to a duel
here radio this message to the falcon
i donald millstein challenge you to a
duel with swords my ship is unharmed
if you do not accept i am going to ram
you thus both of us and all our men
will perish i dare you to don your space
suit and meet me bring no weapon but
propulsion pistols and one sabre i will
bring my ship to within five miles of
yours we will each leave our ships and
fight it out in space may the best man
win signed your sworn enemy mill-
stein 

  cromwell choked a bit but his voice
rang strong and steady as he sent the
message in a few moments came the
reply short and tense

  terms accepted get ready my en-
emy i am coming gladly signed the
falcon

chapter v

a strange duel

t knew that ruse would work
exulted millstein the falcon is
 very proud of his skill with the
swords in russia he gained quite a
reputation as a duelist it is said that
a dozen men died before his deadly
blades that challenge to his pride is his
weak point

  while millstein was talking he was be-
ing assisted into the heavy and bulky
space suit the heavy suit made of pres-
sure resisting material encased his body
like a huge diving outfit the material
was of sufficient tensile strength to pre-
vent the vacuum of space from expanding
his body also it was air tight that the
precious oxygen stored in small cylinders
inside the space suit could not escape ex-

cept that portion used by millstein and
allowed to escape through the release
valve in fact the space suit was strangely
similar to the cumbersome armor used by
deep sea divers the metal part of the
suit was made of an extremely light but
very tough metal its composition was
similar to the aluminum alloys of many
years past the inside of the suit was
lined with gold-beaters skin very
strange that these scientists of a super
age would go to nature for such a mate-
rial but the gold beaters skin was found
to be an excellent material to control
leakage it is the outer membrane of the
large intestine of the ox

  the suit was provided with small
atomic energizers to produce heat for in
the absolute zero of space the occupant
of a space suit would freeze in an instant
unless artificially warmed

  it was with great difficulty that mill-
stein in spite of his extraordinary
strength moved about when he had
donned the suit just before screwing on
the helmet cromwell made another
earnest plea

  let me go in your place chief
youre too important to lose your life in
this fool stunt the falcon wont know
the difference the space suit will dis-
guise me let me go out and cross swords
with the devil anyway i think he will
send a substitute hes too smart to risk
his neck

  no jack this is my affair i believe
i can overcome the falcon your duty
is here at the ship and dont you worry
about the falcon coming himself my
hunch about his sensitive pride is a good
one

  with that millstein clumped forward
into a round airlock in the side of the
ship writh a resigned sigh cromwell
placed in millsteins awkward-looking
hand that was clumsily gloved with
strangely flexible metals a heavy old-
fashioned army cutlass


amazing stories

hief ive sharpened that meat
knife till its like a razor dont
get too close to the falcon try and
pierce his suit and let his oxygen out
goodbye chief good luck

  wait a minute laughed millstein
you act like im going out to meet his
satanic majesty im coming back but
-but-jack if i dont come back do
the best you can with the ship youll
be in full command in case anything hap-
pens to me and dont forget this if
the falcon should overpower me and if
because of any treachery on the part of
the enemy ship i should be captured you
know what to do you know that trick
we talked over the emergency ruse
screw the helmet on

  millstein pushed forward to the end of
the steel lock that was like an iron coffin
there he adjusted his oxygen valves and
tested the heat generators perspiration
instantly streamed from his body and he
turned the apparatus off realizing it was
operating efficiently he could not speak
now for the helmet was tight over his
head but through its clear quartz lens he
winked insultingly at the anxious crom-
well with a nod of his head millstein
signalled for the inner lock-door to be
closed cromwell turned the lever and a
serrated door of the toughest steel two
feet thick slowly closed in front of
cromwell leaving a perfectly smooth
wall

  cromwell yearned with all the fiery
ardor of his adventurous young heart and
an adoring love for his chief to be in the
struggle to come his duty was to re-
main as instructed and with grim deter-
mination depicted upon his countenance
he pushed another lever this he knew
opened the outer steel door of the lock
and millstein was free to push out into
the vast void of endless space

  millstein wise to the uncanny condi-
tions of space gave a slight push against
the wall of the airlock and almost in-

stantly was several hundred feet from the
nemesis it was a strange sensation
floating out in that vast void while the
nemesis and the avenger were
standing still in reality the whole
mass in fact all the universe is moving
in one direction at a vast rate of speed
but as each object in space retains its
relative position unless given inertia it
appeared to millstein that the two ships
and himself were motionless he slowly
raised his right arm that held the sabre
the structure of the material that cov-
ered and protected that strong arm was
extremely heavy and millstein moved
like a figure on a slow motion picture
screen

  for a moment or two he practised
wielding the sword for he knew his life
depended upon his skill and quickness
with that weapon the movement of
raising his arm caused his body to turn
over out of balance so that his face was
away from the enemy ship that would
not do swinging the sword violently in
the opposite direction he succeeded in
turning his grotesque looking body in
space an object will move forever at the
rate of its initial inertia this is because
of the complete vacuum no air and no
resistance in space acceleration and its
rate are affected only by the mass of the
body to be accelerated this effect is due
to what is termed inertia etymologically
speaking inertia can be termed the lazi-
ness of matter for in human life laziness
is sometimes the deadest kind of resis-
tance

    ow that millstein was out of the
  space ship he had to be extremely
careful not to accelerate any movement
too quickly tests on earth had shown
that humans could attain a speed of two
hundred and fifty miles an hour in one
second of acceleration without injury
providing the person was in perfect phys-
ical condition the principal danger that
the velocity of escape



confronted millstein in his coming duel
with the falcon was the risk of sudden
turning while travelling at high speed
this would generate centrifugal force an
effect similar to that of acceleration and
which has a tendency to drive the blood
violently from one side to the other and
risking the rupture of blood vessels but
the learned and skilled scientist was
aware of all these hazards

   once more he checked off the condition
of his oxygen valves and heat units and
found them to be operating perfectly
then he looked carefully toward the
cigar-like shape of the mighty avenger
after a few moments his eyes made out
a tiny figure floating between himself and
the enemy ship

  the falcon

   with his left hand millstein pulled one
of the propulsion pistols from his belt
and fired it in a direction exactly opposite
from that portion of space occupied by
the falcon instantly millsteins body shot
forward and for a moment his breath
came painfully clumsily like a man
trying to pick up a thin dime with boxing
gloves he adjusted the energy charge of
the pistol by means of a large-handled
screw on the side of the pistol

   charges are too strong he muttered

  the propulsion pistols were not wea-
pons of offense or defense they were
simply the means of propulsion in space
by firing the pistol which discharged a
very small burst of atomic energy rays
its recoil pushed millstein in the desired
direction inasmuch as he would move
forever at the rate of his initial inertia
it was necessary to stop by firing a charge
in the opposite direction

  again he looked toward the avenger
and noted that the other human figure if
it could be termed a human figure was
now very much closer this was to be
the supreme test of millsteins flashing
career he realized full well the des-
perate odds against the success of this

encounter he was keenly aware of the
mental powers and resources of his clever
antagonist

  glancing about in four dimensions and
searching the void carefully he could see
no trace of the government scout ship
that had been plunging dizzily about in
the sky

  thats positive proof muttered mill-
stein that the government scout-ship
commanders brain is under the control
of the falcon

  glancing again toward the rapidly ap-
proaching figure of his opponent mill-
stein could see the other was advancing
warily circling as if to study his foe and
plan a proper attack then a very clever
thought came to the young scientist for
a few moments he closed his eyes and
concentrated his mind on the task before
him summoning to his immediate control
all his mental faculties and physical en-
ergies he made his mind a complete
negative as far as all other problems were
concerned for the moment he forgot
his own space ship the nemesis crom-
well and the brave men he had left be-
hind in moments of great emergencies
millstein always followed this rule for
he knew his enemy vast and far-reaching
though his intellect was would have an
incredible amount of detail on his mind

  it was well that millstein suddenly
opened his eyes after his mental concen-
tration for scuttling toward him at terri-
fic velocity came the huge crab-like figure
of the falcon shrewdly and tensely
millstein awaited the bull-like charge
then at the last split second propelled by
a heavy charge from his propulsion pis-
tol he barely eluded the fearless rush of
the other

  that was close muttered millstein

  like two grotesque crustaceans
weighed down with the vast pressure of
a mighty but transparent water the two
fighters maneuvered their attacks and
dodges were surprisingly quick yet their


amazing stories

arms moved with painful slowness-
moved like sisyphus toiling up the eternal
mountain time after time the falcon
charged but always millstein dodged like
a very clever bull fighter who slips aside
when it seems he will be impaled upon
the horns of a furious bull

  millstein was employing a very clever
plan of attack he was saving his
strength the effort of moving heavily
protected arms and legs took a tremen-
dous lot of energy in the mysterious realm
of nothing millstein wisely figured that
the falcon was using up his propulsion
pistol charges very rapidly it was a
soundless battle if either spoke or cursed
the sounds only thundered in their own
ears

  suddenly as the falcon was circling
for another charge millstein keeping his
propulsion pistol well concealed fired a
sudden blast and was hurtled directly to-
ward the falcon it was a propitious
moment for millsteins attack as the fal-
cons body was turned in air so that he
could not present his sword in defense
for a moment it looked as though they
would collide and the falcon be pierced
through and through for millstein held
his heavy blade directly in front of him
he did not try to wield or swing it for
it might have turned his body and he
might then be placed in a position where
he could not defend himself it was a
bitter moment for millstein who had
waited long and patiently through the
weird struggle for this moment the
falcon could not raise his pistol in time
to fire and dodge away but he succeeded
in meeting the attack and with a move-
ment that must have taken incredible
strength swung up his sword and parried
the thrust of millsteins sword

  up to this time the movements of the
combat had been comparatively slow but
now they seemed to move about like two
infuriated monsters of the deep ocean
as millstein plunged by his enemy in a

sudden charge he immediately twisted to
protect his rear to his consternation the
falcon was directly behind him and forc-
ing his acceleration at a dangerous rate
it was then that millstein displayed the
peak of his fighting skill and bravery

  shrewdly noting his position he fired
several atomic blasts against the direc-
tion of his travel holding the pistol to
one side that his body might be turned to
meet his foe he was infuriated it was
to be a battle to the death humanity
would be well served if millstein could
die and wipe out the dangerous falcon

they were together millstein found
his chance and risking all he re-
leased his hold on his propulsion pistol
and with his strong left hand grasped
the left shoulder of the other they were
too close now to use their swords and
as they slowly turned clutched together
the evil eyes of the falcon glared through
his quartz lenses into millsteins eyes

  millstein suddenly felt a great pulling
at his right shoulder and saw that the
falcon had also released his propulsion
pistol and grasped him with his clumsy
hand millstein knew he must act quickly
for he could feel the fearful strength of
the other trying to twist his arm and tear
his space suit like a man in a dream
he watched the sword arm of the falcon
creep upward and raise the sword point
the clever russian was maneuvering his
shorter weapon that he might pierce mill-
steins space suit

  millstein suddenly felt as though a
deadly gas had entered his brain-that
he did not care what happened stub-
bornly he fought against this sluggish-
ness for he knew that the russian was
trying to use a hypnotic or mental influ-
ence after a moments concentration
while he watched the point of the sword
slowly move upward a great mental and
physical strength came to millstein he
knew that he was the others master
the velocity of escape



  concentrating all his muscular effort
and energy into one mighty effort he
struck violently with the hilt of his sword
at the wrist of the falcon it was a des-
perate blow and while the movement
seemed to travel with infinite slowness
yet the heavy heel of the cutlass struck
the russians arm with stunning force
long before the point of the deadly sword
crept upward to millsteins body with
a great exultation millstein saw the heavy
cutlass of the falcon drift away from a
grasping hand and soon the sharp wea-
pon was many feet away from them

  millstein had conquered the falcon but
he must be careful infinitely careful for
he knew full well the vast resources and
treachery of the distorted mind as
quickly as possible and still holding his
mental concentration millstein raised the
point of his cutlass and inserted its sharp
point under the shoulder plate of the
others space suit the falcon glared
with malicious hatred into millsteins
eyes the falcon was defeated for with
a powerful cutting thrust millsteins
sword could be slipped through the
armors joint and allow the oxygen in the
falcons space suit to escape

but the evil powers of the falcon
were not expended still grinning
with a horrible hate he raised his right
hand sluggishly above his head it was
some sort of a signal a terrific tingling
broke out over millsteins body his
mind became numbed his muscles would
not function

  treachery they were sending out a
powerful paralyzing ray from the aven-
ger upon seeing that the falcon had
been defeated

  millstein made a desperate mental
struggle against this terror it seemed that
he was slipping into a dark abyss of ob-
livion-slipping with clutching fingers
that would not hold at an icy slippery
precipice thanatos-the god of death-

brother of sleep-was clutching for him

  just as millsteins mind slipped into
unconsciousness he saw a tiny space
fighter shoot from the avengers stern
and he realized with a last hopeless con-
sciousness that through treachery he had
been defeated by the falcon

chapter vi

the falcon gloats

don millstein struggled pain-
fully back to the realm of con-
sciousness the uncanny instinct
that had carried him safely through many
incredible perils functioned even before
his brain had cleared away the deadly fog

  slowly memory returned to him the
weird battle of swords in space-how he
had overpowered the falcon a realiza-
tion of the trickery and treachery used to
overcome him he was lying on some
soft substance probably a couch and now
knew he was a captive on board the
avenger millstein kept his eyes closed
while his still reeling brain recovered
normality

  he decided he would pretend he was
unconscious until his strength had fully
returned he could plainly feel that the
space suit had been removed from his
body he wondered if he was bound but
did not dare to move as a test

  he heard a voice close by the cruel
harsh voice of the falcon

  millstein will recover in a few mo-
ments the paralyzing rays must have
hit him severely i could feel them in
spite of the protective screen i had

  millstein yearned to spring to his feet
and strike the falcon down as he heard
the foul treachery disclosed in a cool
hard voice he lay quiet his agile brain
scheming-planning-every sense alert
the harsh voice of the falcon again
grated loudly giving technical instructions
to some member of his crew


amazing stories

  and see that the lenses that convert
the cosmic rays are adjusted that the
changed rays strike the earth from lati-
tude forty to sixty as the cursed planet
revolves

  there was an insane chuckle in the
falcons voice as he continued

  that path will pla the changed rays
over london germany russia salt lake
city chicago new york and boston if
only millstein had not discovered what i
am doing another six months and the
world will be mine a dead lifeless globe
then after all life has ceased i will re-
store the oxygen strata then my chil-
dren we will take earth i will be the
supreme ruler i will start a new civili-
zation

  millstein controlled himself with great
difficulty but succeeded when the im-
portant information he was seeking came
from the lips of the falcon millsteins
nerves tensed for an ordeal when he
heard the falcon drawing closer finally
he could feel the russians hot breath on
his cheek as a rough finger pulled his
eyelid down for examination a shrewd
calculating look crept into the russians
face as he placed two fingers upon mill-
steins wrist millstein made a strong
mental effort to control his heart action
but he knew his pulse had accelerated and
that his simulation of unconsciousness
was discovered

  ah so exulted the falcon the
great millstein the worlds hero feigns
unconsciousness like a cowardly pos-
sum come my enemy i want a little
talk with you

realizing that his subterfuge was
discovered millstein rose to a
sitting posture on the couch deliberately
and coolly he executed a great gaping
yawn like a man awakened from a long
and hearty sleep he was dealing with
an insane man and decided he would
humor him in every possible way

  millstein felt that although the falcon
was cruel and remorseless his own life
was safe at least for the time being he
reasoned cromwell would not attack with
the nemesis for fear of in jurying him

  simulating a vast nonchalance mill-
stein sat back comfortably on the couch
and looked squarely and fearlessly into
the blazing eyes of his enemy he could
feel the hypnotic influence of those bright
evil orbs but confident in the strength of
his own powers he gazed unflinchingly
after a moment the falcon spoke in a
sneering tone

  the great millstein is brave but be-
fore i am finished you will wish you
could die

  millstein planned to again attack the
weak spot in the falcons armor-his
egotism

  fine ship you have verensky from
millstein appraisingly as he glanced
coolly about the well arranged little room
he tried a daring thrust

  i suppose your ship has some ap-
paratus thats changing the cosmic ray
vibrations before they reach earth

  it required all of millsteins courage
and fortitude to remain unflinching as
the falcon sprang forward drawing
from his belt a deadly ray gun on the
russians face was a demoniacal expres-
sion his eyes blazed hate and anger
and for a moment he lost his composure
and caution

  so he snarled you think you have
discovered what i am doing well you
will never profit by it you cant stop me
i will not be stopped i have you in my
power i have a fate in store for you
more terrible than even your clever imag-
ination can picture i am going to rule
the world the falcons voice rose to
a berserk scream

 a fter i have conquered the world

i will conquer the other planets
come with me i will show you the de-
the velocity of escape



vice that changes the cosmic rays theres
no risk in showing you you will live
but i will rule your brain

  millstein rose to his feet scarcely able
to restrain his eagerness he had taunted
the falcon into a reckless anger and ap-
parently he was going to see the device
his mind raced perhaps he could de-
stroy the device that changed the cosmic
rays first however he must see how
it was constructed cleverly he fanned
the flame of the russians anger

  verensky i think you are bluffing
my reference to the cosmic rays was but
a ruse as far as my personal safety is
concerned do what you like i would not
expect you to play fair after our space
battle with swords by the way veren-
sky i have heard youre very clever with
the blades why not give me the satis-
faction of crossing swords with you right
now in this room

  with a crafty look on his face the
russians sudden rage in a great measure
dissipated and his usual cunning re-
turned

  you are indeed clever my enemy oh
no i will not fight a duel with you i
have other plans you are going to be
one of my lieutenants

  what exclaimed millstein i work
with you-the most dangerous criminal
in all the universe its a war to the
death verensky and while you have me
in your power i would advise you to kill
me

  millstein was cleverly trying to lead
out from the falcon some idea as to his
fate

  but i am not going to kill you
laughed the falcon in derision i am
going to obtain control of your mind and
take from your brain all its information
just as i would squeeze a sponge
millstein could see the anger rising in
the crazed criminal

  you cant get control of my mind by
hypnosis or any other method stated

millstein in an insulting tone my will-
power is stronger than yours

  the russian trembled with rage but
in a short second gained control of his
emotions and millsteins blood ran cold
at the deadly tone in his enemys voice

  yes of course millstein your brain
is strong your will is mighty thats
the reason i want them insane chuckles
came from the corded throat of the giant
russian dont you see my fine heroic
altruist-you who pose as the savior of
the world-you who bask in the warm
light of the public favor dont you see
fool i want your brain because it is a
fine brain in your present condition you
could resist my hypnotic influence for
some time but i have methods of my
own these men standing back of you
with drawn weapons are under my influ-
ence see the dull meaningless stare in
their eyes their hopeless expressions i
own their souls i do their thinking i
am their brains they are mine

  with that the russian beat his breast
with mighty blows

  i am the falcon

     illstein turned and looked in-
 tently at three tall strong men
who stood directly at his back with drawn
ray guns they were like mechanical
men yet depicted upon their countenances
was a tense watchfulness millstein knew
the slightest movement on his part to
attack the falcon would mean his instant
death he turned again to the russian
who was continuing his wild oration
millstein was gaining valuable informa-
tion and continued to taunt the russian
in the hope he might see the apparatus
affecting the cosmic rays

  well why dont you go ahead and
try to hypnotize me goaded millstein

  the falcon studied millstein intently
for some moments then he came closer
wringing his hands like a miser counting
gold pieces
amazing stories

  not yet my enemy not yet there is
a way to weaken your resistance you
will go without food for many days
when the body weakens eventually the
will-power weakens then too you shall
have a very special treatment you shall
have heshi the drug that i discovered on
venus a nice big dose twice a day and
after a week you will not have will-power
enough to claim your own soul it will
be mine

  it spoke well for millsteins courage
that he showed not the slightest fear at
the mention of heshi he knew of that
fiendish drug that weakened mens resis-
tance stupefying the brain and causing
them to be subservient to a stronger will
the falcon had no suspicion of the tu-
mult in millsteins breast as the young
scientist laughed

  i should not think the great falcon
would have to resort to a drug to best his
enemies where is your boasted power
i am amused then millstein tried a
bolder play i do not believe you have
any machine or device to affect the cos-
mic rays

  all right snarled the russian you
shall see and then you will be confined
and start your education as a drug ad-
dict

  the falcon gave instruction to the
three guards in some strange language
and the mechanical men instantly formed
behind millstein the group progressed
through a long corridor and passed many
rooms filled with whirling machinery and
active operators

  millstein was impressed with the mag-
nitude of the ship he yearned to ask
the falcon where the ship had been built
it must have taken years to construct
such a craft trained though he was in
the operation and mechanical features of
space ships yet there were many devices
and machines unfamiliar to millstein

  finally turning through a side corri-
dor they came to a balcony that over-

looked a room of circular shape some
five hundred feet in diameter in this
room were hundreds of intricate ma-
chines-dynamos condensers and various
kinds of complex electrical devices the
falcon stared into that vast circular room
filled with whirling machinery with the
look of a religious devotee worshipping
an idol his thin cruel lips drooled an
insane prayer of hate and vengeance as
though the devil were praying with his
vicious eyes bulging from their sockets
he glared at millstein

  there it is my enemy for years i
have worked look at my marvelous ma-
chines whirling-breaking up atoms-
-changing vibrations

  millstein did not reply his keen mind
strove to analyze the devilish machines in
the mighty room he noted one incredi-
bly large dynamo with a giant flywheel
revolving at terrific speed this dynamo
was connected to a long series of ma-
chines that appeared to be huge trans-
formers the air in the center of the
room was filled with blue and violet rays
these color rays seemed to form like a
large cloud that weaved and contorted
about the room twisting and whirling in
a mighty whirlpool of energy it would
expand and assume grotesque shapes us-
ually rounded like some protoplasm mill-
stein knew he could not analyze the
apparatus without a close and lengthy ex-
amination and he felt sure that the fal-
con would give him no technical infor-
mation he regretted that he had not
concealed some high-powered explosive
to hurl among the machines

ice little workshop he com-
mented but those machines cant
affect the cosmic rays its ridiculous

  for a moment the russian swelled with
red rage then his caution gained the up-
per hand

  i must be careful you are clever
but i will not tell you how its done
the velocity of escape



i wont i wont his voice rose to a
scream ill tell you this much this
apparatus is built in the center of my
space ship this room is five hundred
feet across it changes the cosmic rays
as they flash toward earth the great
lenses at the top of the ship focus them
to the center where the interesting little
ball of color rays gives them my secret
treatment then the changed rays are re-
fracted and transmitted through the
lenses in the bottom of the ship the
converted rays go on to earth where they
do queer tricks with oxygen electrons i
have been unable to change the cosmic
rays to affect other elements as they do
oxygen but i am working on that and
you are going to help me you have a
fine mind when ive gained control of
it you are going to be my assistant you
have a lot of knowledge i can use come
now millstein you are going to be
locked in a cell and the only food you
will get is the pleasant drug

   there is just one thing you have over-
looked shot out millstein defiantly i
left instruction with my space ship to
attack in two hours if anything happened
to me

   is that so sneered the russian and
you prate about treachery he laughed
long and loudly in two hours you said
my enemy you dont know how long
you were under the effects of the paralyz-
ing ray listen you have been on board
the avenger for twelve hours

  millstein made no reply but in his
dark brave eyes crept a more determined
expression

chapter vii

a mental duel

the falcon led the way back along
the corridor until millstein knew
they must be close to the stern of
the mighty avenger millstein was

desperate and he hastened his steps
closer to the rapidly striding verensky
it seemed however that the falcon could
see through the back of his head for
without turning and grunting out a hor-
rible chuckle he gave quick orders to
the bodyguard directly behind millstein
the guard moved up closer and two rap-
idly stepped in front of millstein so that
he was practically surrounded as they
walked along millstein looked intently
into each room he was fixing in his
mind the plan of the ship

   the resourceful young scientist had
often been in desperate situations but
none so hopeless as the present in each
room or compartment he could see robot
men working on intricate machinery the
avenger was without question a
mighty space fighter equipped with every
possible means of offense and defense

   an officer who appeared to be of a
higher mental type than the others came
out from one of the side corridors and
spoke respectfully to the falcon on the
officers face was the same vacant set
expression but his features were more
finely chiselled and it was plain he pos-
sessed more initiative than the others
still the resigned hopeless expression in
the dull eyes showed the mind belonged
to the falcon

   great cosmos muttered millstein
the falcon has all his officers and crew
under mental domination he takes no
chance of treachery or disobedience

   then he dared a few more rapid steps
that he might hear what the officer was
conveying to the falcon whatever the
message was millstein never knew for
the conversation was in a strange tongue
but whatever it was the falcon was great-
ly pleased for he turned to chuckle gloat-
ingly at hia prisoner

   heres some news for you my enemy
my radio officer reports that for some
hours there has been no message coming
from your ship just for your informa-


amazing stories

tion ill say we have been turning a new
deadly ray on your ship it is one of my
new weapons and i know that your ship
has no protective screens for this ray
the crazed russian beat his breast like
an infuriated gorilla no one but the
falcon would have thought of it it took
me two years to perfect it i have pro-
duced a high sound-vibration that travels
along a beam of light and instantly para-
lyzes every human within the radius of
its active range your men will be un-
conscious and disabled for many hours
the weaker ones will die some brains
disintegrate from the terrific vibrations
i killed a hundred men before i perfected
it but what is a mans life compared to
the plans of the falcon i who will rule
the world and all the planets

courageous and quick-witted
though he was millstein nearly be-
trayed his sudden exultation there was
now a desperate hopea fighting chance
he knew the falcon had discovered the
sound vibration ray the same he had him-
self perfected his heart bounded with
a wild hope he knew cromwell was
playing the trick-the daring ruse they
had used before in seemingly hopeless
situations

  of course millstein reasoned the
falcon having discovered the sound vi-
bration ray has no doubt built up a pro-
tective screen for the same ray if used
against his avenger thats the reason
my weapon did not affect the avenger 

  a most disturbing thought came into
his mind perhaps cromwell had forgot-
ten to turn on the defensive screens to
neutralize rays and vibrations perhaps
his gallant lieutenant had been lured into
a sense of false security during the battle
of swords in space millstein instantly
put the thought aside as unworthy crom-
well had never failed him in any detail
he suddenly felt confident that his young
lieutenant was trying the ruse they had

used before-an incredibly simple yet
strangely effective strategy

  the falcons cruel heart was gladdened
to note millsteins look of dejection be-
cause of the startling information about
the paralyzing ray a most clever bit of
acting to the falcon it seemed mill-
stein was making an effort to appear non-
chalant-not to show he was greatly
perturbed

  ah ha croaked the falcon that
gets under your skin i warned you not
to interfere with my plans now you are
my prisoner with a horrible fate in the
future for you your fine space fighter
is disabled your men paralyzed i have
destroyed one of the government scout
ships i have gained control of the com-
manders brains in the other now do
you know what i am going to do  i am
going to order the commander in the
government space ship to dash his craft
into the nemesis 

  a sudden partial sanity returned to the
falcon

  no no he screamed his lips work-
ing crazily that would not do that
is foolish-is it not millstein  i can use
both those ships in my warfare against
earth i shall take them back to-

  millstein had been listening intently-
eagerly-for he had gained important in-
formation from the rambling russian
he had admitted the government space
ship was under his mental control and
had nearly told millstein where his vast
workshop was located millstein now
knew the falcons mighty factories were
on some dead or unknown planet far be-
yond the solar planetary system-some
uncanny place in the endless realms of si-
lent space where the fantastical plans of
a distorted mind were developed again
a surge of confidence swept over mill-
stein like an engulfing wave to give him
a mighty confidence in his own powers
by some uncanny instinct he knew he
was the mental master of the falcon that
the velocity of escape



his wits were keener his will more
powerful he tried another rare strategy

  but no one knows how to operate the
nemesis but myself its controls are
known only to myself and to my brave
lieutenant cromwell who is now para-
lyzed

  with that millstein managed to look
very sad and hopeless as he continued

  you will never use the nemesis
verensky for built within its compart-
ments are explosives and any attempt
to operate it by one not knowing the con-
cealed secret devices would blast it into
eternity

t think you lie snarled the fal-
    con

  oh very well think as you like
taunted millstein but you will never use
the nemesis why dont you go over
and try to operate the ship 

  this last bolt struck a responsive cord
in the russians twisted mentality

  that is just what we will do mill-
stein you and i and of course a group
of my trained men will board the nem-
esis there i will drug you and keep
you prisoner until your weakened mind
gives me the secret of the controls
millstein could have shouted for joy
the trick had worked i f he could only
get aboard the nemesis

  ill never do it he screamed you
cant make me do it its horrible to
think of your using my nemesis against
the world

  then millstein used his cleverest soph-
istry-played a seemingly poltroonly part
to gain his point

  verensky he began in a voice plead-
ing and almost servile you are the
greatest mind in the universe you pos-
sess the most marvelous fund of scien-
tific learning i beg of you to give up
this wild idea of conquering the world
you could be great with your mighty
power and intellect you could be a-bene-

factor to mankind with your skill and re-
sources why you could change the ro-
tations of the earth at will and make cli-
mates to fit mans need you could put
life into the dead planets cool off those
too hot for habitation warm those that
are too cold there is no limit to the
good you could accomplish why you
could be next to the master mind there
are none so powerful as you if you will
give up your mad idea of universal de-
struction i donald millstein will work
at your side together we will do all
these things i ask this of you in the
name of humanity

  for a moment during the impassioned
appeal of millstein a strange uncanny
light glowed in the face of the mad rus-
sian calm reason seemed to be strug-
gling to shine in the glittering eyes and
for a brief second millstein fancied that
he had gained a point but suddenly
with the wild scream of a madman the
russian beat on his breast till it sounded
like a drum incoherent words puled
from his twitching lips

  now you will die a thousand deaths
my enemy how dare you ask me the
falcon the sworn enemy of the world
to be an altruist altruism bah say
no more or i will turn a ray gun on
you

  the russian was trembling in a fit of
uncontrolled anger as he turned to ihe
waiting officer

et ready a squad of fifty of my
best engineers we are going to
board the nemesis i will wring from
millstein the secrets of his ship we
will keep him captive and i will torture
him with my bare hands and drug him
until i am his master

  millstein put his head in his hands and
bowed as though broken he could
scarcely control his emotions he real-
ized joyously that he had tricked the
madman


amazing stories

  they were going to board the nem-
esis 

chapter viii

on board the nemesis

the falcon accompanied by a
greatly increased number of offi-
cers moved with millstein to the
extreme stern of the great ship millstein
appeared a broken man as he walked
along but his shrewd trained mind was
noting every detail and analyzing every
opportunity he observed keenly the
movements of every man keeping a care-
ful observation of the falcons move-
ments

  they finally entered a large tube at
the end of the ship a tube about thirty
feet in diameter in this long tube re-
posed a small space ship as millstein
was being pushed into this tiny projectile
he noted the falcon had suddenly dis-
appeared this was a cause of worry to
millstein for he wished with a mighty
hope that the falcon would accompany
the group on the trip to his own ship
minutes passed and the crew were each
at their particular post ready to launch
the little carrier ship millstein noted
that each man was heavily armed with
ray guns and equipped with some sort of
protective armor a strange metallic fab-
ric that glowed with the light of dancing
colors millstein reasoned the suits were
resistive screens against ray guns of all
sorts

   to his great relief the tall figure of the
falcon suddenly entered the little craft
and took a place at the main controls
millstein standing only a few feet from
the falcon studied his enemy with in-
finite care the russian returned his
searching scrutiny with a baleful glance

  for some reason the madman appeared
to be a bit thinner in spite of the fact he
also wore the strange metal garment that

glowed with some strong and static
energy at the moment millstein did not
consider this of unusual importance and
he put the thought out of his mind the
steel door of the space projectile was
closed verensky uttered sharp gutteral
commands in that weird tongue and
millstein knew they were floating in
space soon he felt the slight grating
contact against his own ship he knew
they had entered one of its carrier tubes
his heart thrilled and the strong muscles
of his body tensed for action he bent
his head and concentrated all his mental
capacities on the coming test

  he was rudely pushed through the
open door of the little space carrier into
the launching and boarding tube of his
own ship the falcon craftily took a
place at the rear of the group

  open the inside door millstein or-
dered the falcon in hard dangerous
tones

  millstein stepped forward none but
he in the group knew how to operate the
strong steel doors that would admit them
directly into the nemesis the cleverly
constructed doors of incredibly tough
steel slid silently back millstein in the
lead of the entire group stepped directly
into one of the power rooms of the nem-
esis he glanced about and a cleverly
faked moan escaped his tense lips

   slumped over at the seats of their oper-
ating chairs and lying in grotesque heaps
on the floor were his fine trained assis-
tants then millstein acted the part of a
madman and he turned like an infuriated
tiger to glare at the falcon

  my good men you have killed them
you crazy fiend you murderer of
worlds

  the falcon laughed throatily and his
words gurgled with joy

  no they are not all dead my enemy
some of the strongest will no doubt live
a clever weapon my new paralyzing
sound vibration perhaps ill try it out
the velocity of escape



on you in a mild way to help weaken your
will

  knowing that it pleased the mad fal-
con millstein continued to sob loudly as
he bent over the men lying sprawled upon
the floor suddenly he stopped at one
limp figure with sprawled arms hanging
down over a radio table

  and you have killed jack cromwell
my best assistant millstein frothed
leaping wildly towards the falcon

  several of the guards clutched mill-
stein and seemingly subdued him like
an actor enjoying a dramatic moment on
the stage the falcon strode about

  shackle millstein he ordered
fasten him securely i will admin-
ister drugs and torture him to learn the
secrets of the ship

  wait a minute shouted millstein in
the voice of stentor he had decided to
play his trump card-he would spring
the trick

  the falcon looked up intently a queer
expression spreading over his face as he
suddenly sensed danger-a trap

  with a panther-like spring millstein
suddenly leaped from the grasping hands
of his captors and uttered a loud shout

  for earth

  a most amazing thing occurred mill-
steins men who had seemingly been un-
conscious or dead suddenly leaped to
their feet as if actuated by one spring
each brave and trained assistant held in
his hand a deadly ray gun like a swiftly
moving and intricate mechanism each
man jumped to an invader and covered
him with the ray pistols they had held
under their bodies as they lay about the
room the invaders who possessed no
wills of their own were no match for
millsteins men even had the numbers
been equal 

  jack cromwell had leaped to a position
directly in front of his beloved chief
millstein threw an affectionate arm over

his assistants shoulder good old
jack he muttered happily our trick
worked beautifully

  it sure did chief when they turned
the paralyzing ray on us we fortunately
had our protective screens working i
did what you told me just before you left
we adjusted the ship to be neutral and
dead and the falcon thought we were
paralyzed

  just an old western gun fighters
trick grinned millstein happily

  great scott shot out cromwell
look at the falcon

  millstein however before looking at
his defeated enemy glanced carefully
about the room to note that each of the
enemy was safely subdued then he di-
rected his attention toward the falcon

  the mad russian had dropped to his
knees his face uplifted there was a
strained hopeless expression on the cruel
countenance his eyes were closed and
he appeared to be in a trance

  whats he doing chief

  keep ray guns trained on him
snapped millstein hes a tricky rogue
i think he is trying to project his mind
perhaps trying to give mental orders to
the crew on board his avenger well
cromwell i guess the falcons days are
over vsubdue him with paralyzing rays
iron him securely give him drugs to
keep him asleep until we reach earth
of course we will destroy the avenger
first that should not be so hard now
with the master mind missing

  the crazed eyes of the russian opened
he began to creep on his hands and knees
towards millstein who held a ray gun
ready against trickery but in the eyes
of the advancing madman there was a
dog-like look the look of a beaten ani-
mal there was a frantic prayer on the
now sagging face the falcon was brok-
en-defeated

  frothing and puling at the mouth the
massive figure advanced came close to


amajzing stories

the young scientist and with trembling
limbs struggled erect

  wait millstein wait dont drug
me dont take me to earth

  then even millstein was astounded
and for a moment greatly disconcerted as
the crazed russian suddenly snatched
from his face a false beard and mus-
tache with incredulous eyes millstein
watched the cruel features of his enemy
relax into softer lines

  dont you see millstein  pleaded the
beaten figure the falcon is uncanny
in his wisdom it was the falcon you
talked to on the avenger but i am not
the falcon i am only his wretched tool
one of his many doubles he drugs us
with a strange drug he holds our lives
in his hand only he knows the antidote
for the horrible drug he gives us even
at this moment i must have the antidote
or i will die dont you see that is the
way he keeps us in submission he takes
our brains poisons us and keeps us alive
with the antidote

  millstein stood speechless-amazed as
the man who had acted the part of the
falcon went on the deception had been
more than perfect

  the falcon has sent me to my death
he knew in his uncanny wisdom this
visit to your ship meant a possible trap
he cannot be defeated i must have the
antidote

  i am not the falcon

  becoming alert with a mighty mental
jerk millstein turned to cromwell and
gave the order

  quick turn full energy on all pro-
tective screens and rocket away full speed
for five hundred miles

  we may be attacked by the avenger
at any moment from this on

  then more grimly the falcon is
aboard his ship and its a battle to the
death

  it was at last to be decided

chapter ix

heroism and tragedy

illstein greatly worried
but more determined than ever
to destroy the falcon was at
the control board of the nemesis the
fast space fighter had been rocketed away
one thousand miles from the avenger
for some time millstein listened to tech-
nical information coming from various
compartments of the space car the fear-
less young scientist was in his element at
the control instruments

  the falcon had escaped-outwitted
millstein for the moment

  well chief said the ever present
and efficient cromwell a message has
just come in from our port forward hold
that all the crew from the avenger have
died even that tall husky bird who was
the falcons double has croaked he was
right about the poison in his body
thats the falcons way answered
millstein he knew the men wouldnt
live to talk much if they were captured
a clever fiend to trick me as he did but
after all i was lucky to get back to the
nemesis 

  what next chief asked cromwell
shall we attack the avenger 

  in due time from millstein in sharp
tones i want to plan a sure attack
that will not fail i am certain the fal-
can has a defensive screen for every
weapon we have the avenger is a most
amazing ship that crazed russian is
the smartest scientist in the universe

except yourself hastened crom-
well

  if the remaining government ship
could help us we could attack and to-
gether wear down the power storage of
the avenger jack weve got to destroy
the falcon and his super-craft in order to
save the world the commander of the
the velocity of escape



government ship is under the control of
the falcons evil mind so that ally is
helpless theres only one thing left

to do

  a worried look crept into cromwells
face as he divined the portent in mill-
steins voice

  you dont mean chief that youre

going to-

  yes jack interrupted millstein
im going to ram the nemesis at full
speed into the avenger

  im ready chief stated the brave
cromwell gulping a bit lets go
shall i tell the crew we are all ready
to die if we can wipe out the falcon
good old chap praised millstein i
knew you would do it but you see jack

you and the crew are not going-

  not going chief

  no jack you and the crew are to
take to the space carriers and return to
earth as soon as you are all clear a
thousand miles i will-well-ill do the
job up right there was a slight break
in millsteins voice as a mighty emotion
flooded him

  its the only way jack we cant de-
stroy the avenger with our equipment
and theres no time to develop new
weapons the oxygen is rapidly leaving
earth ive made up my mind get the
crew together and lets get it over
cromwrell started to protest but a
glance at the determined expression on
his beloved chiefs face told him words
were futile

  with swimming eyes the courageous
young cromwell managed a sickly lip-
trembling grin

  righto chief and crash him hard
i would say about two hundred feet to-
ward the bow from center thats where
you say the lenses are located that are
changing the cosmic rays

  speaking hurriedly to smother his feel-
ing cromwell phoned urgent orders to
all parts of the ship-orders that scurried

wondering men to the small space car-
riers in the bow and stern of the nef-
esis

  it spoke well for the crews careful
training that it was only a few moments
when cromwell turned sadly to millstein

  theyre in the carriers chief every
one

  everyone but you cromwell

  let me stay chief i want to dash to
glory with you it will be a big kick

please chief i-

  millstein reached out and grasped
cromwells hand in a bone-cracking grip

oodbye cromwell get out
now old chap take the crew to
earth they need you

 goodbye chief i-

  cromwells voice broke into a sob and
with a last despairing pleading look he
leaped away

  after a moment millstein spoke into a
phone

  all set jack okay im releasing
you all from the launching tubes

  millstein pulled a group of levers while
his eyes watched the reflectoscope in an
instant ten small space cars flashed away
on their long journey toward earth they
were grouped in formation like homing
geese

  with quick adjustments millstein
tuned a radio to make contact with crom-
well in a trice he had attuned the
wave

  high tail for home cromwell you
may take my laboratories and personal
effects now goodbye and quit sending
that mushy stuff ill be too busy
millstein grimly fingered the controls
as he tooled his space-fighter further away
from the avenger he wanted dis-
tance-five thousand miles-to gather full
velocity he was a machine now-a
nerveless unfeeling mechanism with just
one idea in mind he was utterly de-
void of fear


amazing stories

  carefully his eyes studied instruments
and the reflectoscopes he noted with a
start that the government space ship was
flashing along with his craft very close
it came-too close the risky proximity
of the government ship set millstein
thinking he watched it carefully per-
haps the falcon had divined his purpose
and was sending the craft to defeat his
purpose millstein did not fear the
heavier and clumsier ship his better
equipped ship could easily evade the
other and the protective rays and screens
of the  nemesis were vastly stronger
than those of the other ship

  then the sudden uncanny intuition
that had so often saved millstein came
again to him he steered the nemesis
dangerously closer to the other

  millstein knew the government ship
was now in the effective area of his own
protective ray screens the strange in-
tuition told him the move might develop
something important

  it did

  almost instantly the radio phone near
millsteins ear began to operate the
commander of the government space
fighter was speaking

  in a few terse words millstein ex-
plained the situation to the gallant officer
millstein learned the commander had
suddenly gone under some mental influ-
ence at the start of the battle the offi-
cer did not know what had happened
and he was deeply grieved to hear of the
loss of the other government fighter and
the result of the attack on the avenger
millstein did not tell the officer of his
intention to ram his ship into the enemy

y crew are all dead or mad i
am the only normal soul on
board the government officers voice
was a prayer what shall i do mill-
stein  my crew are madmen they are
now trying to kill me they are observed
by some terrible mental influence i have

locked them out of the control room
they are trying to crash the door im
lost millstein im going to ram the
avenger i-

  the voice in the phone ceased and
millstein watched the other craft with
anxious eyes suddenly it turned with
startling speed and was gone

  i guess his crazed crew broke the door
down mused millstein sorrowfully as
he bent every energy and faculty to the
task at hand-his last flight

  turning the nemesis in a wide
swinging circle millstein adjusted the re-
flectoscope to show the huge reflected
image of the far distant avenger he
gradually fed full power to the atomic
propulsion tubes the nemesis became
a long hurtling meteor streaking through
the heavens

  faster and faster sped the nemesis
straight toward the avenger that grew
larger and larger before millsteins
gleaming eyes it would soon be over
a mighty crash-and disintegration

  millstein-a believer-moved his grey
tense lips in prayer

  suddenly he tensed on the reflecting
screen showed another flashing shape

  the government ship gasped mill-
stein realizing now that the courageous
officer was far in front of him and indeed
attempting to crash the avenger

  millstein savagely turned on the last
bit of his energy to increase his speed
his eyes were glued to the screen he
saw unfolded a most horrible tragedy

  with a vast explosion the two ships
ahead of him suddenly became a revolv-
ing mass of hurtling mangled parts un-
told miles of the void were instantly
filled with broken steel and fabric-to
drift forever in endless space

  the sinister falcon and his hell-ship
the avenger was destroyed many
gallant men had perished and a brave
officer had carved deeply his name in the
halls of fame rut earth was saved
the velocity of escape



millstein was badly shaken and
impressed by the horror but new
perils for him now required his full men-
tal concentration his terriffic speed had
carried his ship directly among the whirl-
ing hurtling fragments-many of the
fragments larger than the nemesis a
collision would mean disaster

  playing his disintegration and atom ex-
ploding rays like fire hoses millstein in a
few hours cleared the void of the large
and dangerous fragments with a fer-
vent prayer for the heroes of the govern-
ment fighters he flashed away from the
harrowing scene

  already he had radio connection with
the frantically happy cromwell wrho
would soon be at his chiefs side

  cut out that raving cromwell im
all right slow up and get ready to come
on board im tired

  millsteins voice seemed to hold all the
suffering of the ages he had seen a
man die grandly

  it wont be long now chief well
soon be home and what a home-coming
for you cromwell at the controls
with millstein was happy

  the whole world is waiting to fete
you by the way the last radio from
earth states the oxygen is already becom-
ing normal what a relief to know the
falcon is dead

  for some time millstein did not reply
he had been thinking-intently studying
some mighty problem he spoke slowly

  jack i wonder about the falcon
why did he not attack us after i got back
to our ship its uncanny not like
him it worries me a bit

  sensing his chief was in an analytical
mood cromwell resorted to their old cus-
tom to help millstein think

  say chief look there high in the
heavens the mighty star sirius

 strange cromwell that you
should mention sirius i was think-
ing of that star sirius the dog star
as the ancients called it

  cromwell grinned he knew millstein
would give out information and thus
stimulate his thoughts sure enough
millstein began in a far-away voice

  the ancients built temples and pic-
tured sirius the dog star rising from
the eastern horizon they thought the
star affected their happiness and the
weather millstein wnt on academi-
cally and in an absent-minded tone

  the astronomer bessel discovered in
eighteen hundred and fifty that sirius
was moving among the stars in a wobbly
path this vast star is extremely heavy
for its size its-

  millstein suddenly stopped speaking as
a strange light broke over his face

  jack ive a hunch the falcons fac-
tories are on that star in a few weeks
we will take a trip to sirius and look
around

  cromwell was not heeding his ears
were fastened to phones connected to a
powerful receiving radio a look of in-
credulous wonder had spread over his
face his eyes were bulging with amaze-
ment

  listen chief by the great cosmos
heres a message from space ill re-
peat it

  to my enemy donald millstein you
thought me dead i sensed a trap and
escaped in a space carrier while you were
being taken to your ship you fool do
not think i am finished beware the
falcon will swoop again it is war to the
death signed the falcon

  cromwell choked and sputtered

  chief what do you think of that
the falcon is alive

by stanton a coblentz

mr coblentz is one of the best liked authors with whose works we have
been favored in the present story he appears in the role of a short story
teller and very ingeniously brings everything to a happy conclusion where
a whole nation is rescued from tyranny and almost extinction we are

sure that our readers will enjoy it

illustrated by morey

had it not been for the ex-
ample of the hunting wasp
the whole extraordinary epi-
sode would never have oc-
curred as professor of
entomology at a south american uni-
versity and specialist in the ways of
the hymenoptera dr andres mandano
had given prolonged study to those wasps
which as everyone knows are able to
paralyze their victims and leave them in
a state of suspended animation so that
they may eventually form succulent liv-
ing morsels for still undeveloped reviv-
ing larvae by what leap of the imagina-
tion the professor bridged the gap from
insect to human and thought of applying
waspish methods to mankind is a ques-
tion that will perhaps never be answered
but at all events we know that after years
of research he had solved the secret of
the insect poison and was able to brew
it in considerable quantities and to apply
it in a practical way to mankind

  in the beginning it appears dr man-
danos motives were wholly laudable for
it had been his hope to develop a new an-
aesthetic which would supplant ether and
make it possible to perform operations
without inconvenience or danger to the
patient could he have foreseen the re-

lentless use that was to be made of his
discovery the unparalleled abuses and the
vast upheavals that were to follow prob-
ably he would promptly have hurled the
formula into the ocean

  in any land other than south america
of the twenty-first century however the
formula might not have been perverted to
sinister uses but it will be recalled that
a series of revolutions had but recently
convulsed dr mandanos home country
of peravia that a military dictatorship
had been established and that there
existed just that degree of popular sub-
ordination which made the so-called
mandana man-preservcr a logical de-
velopment it will be recalled how public
liberties had been curtailed following the
rise of the revolutionary government of
rodrigo querzal how free speech had
been eradicated how labor unions had
been destroyed how communists and
non-conforming religious groups had
been persecuted how military demands
and organizations had been strengthened
and how finally a compulsory steriliza-
tion decree had been adopted to cut off
the progeny of undesirable elements of
the population-in a word elements op-
posed to querzal

  what was more natural accordingly

than that the mandano man-preserver be
utilized as the culminating check upon the
liberties of the masses

but before going on to describe the
actual use of the new invention
perhaps i should say a word as to its na-
ture it was literally what the name im-
plies-the means of preserving men and
of preserving them over indefinite lengths
of time not a mere method of keeping
their mummified corpses a method of
keeping the men themselves in a state
between sleep and death an injection of
less than one cubic centimeter of dr
mandanos paralyzing fluid based on the
formula learned from the wasps would
causc a man to collapse into a state of
seeming lifelessness he would cease to
breathe there would be no sign of heart
action his face would take on a waxy pal-
lor which would show no sign of change
during the course of days weeks or even
years and yet at any time upon the in-
jection of the proper antidote he might
be revived feeling a little drowsy like
one awakened from deep slumber but
otherwise unaffected

  the secret of suspended animation in
a word had been mastered

  but having been mastered it was not
employed as it might have been for hu-
manitarian and surgical purposes in-
stead as the world in this good year 
is well aware it became the nefarious tool
of a political and social class

  it is not certain whether dr mandano
himself was involved in the misuse of his
invention or whether beneath the iron
compulsion of the querzal dictatorship
he bent reluctantly to the will of the gov-
ernment and delivered over the paralyz-
ing fluid into hands less scrupulous than
his own in any case the result is in no
doubt at all some evil genius in an un-
lucky hour conceived of the idea of pre-
serving and storing the nations excess
man-power of preserving and storing it

precisely as one would preserve and
store so many hams herrings or dill
pickles why not build huge warehouses
he argued where all excess human beings
could be kept and filed away for refer-
ence  why not take all beggars and vaga-
bonds and put them into a state of sus-
pended animation until the dawn of a
better day why not seize all unem-
ployed workers and their families and
instead of allowing them to become a bur-
den on the community quietly paralyze
them and leave them in registered com-
partments until their services should be
required when they might be immediately
awakened and why not in the same
manner build up a vast and irresistible
army why not train as many soldiers
as possible and then instead of continu-
ing to feed and quarter them put them
into a state of inexpensive paralysis until
the advent of war should make them
necessary  in this manner peravia might
build up a matchless military machine at
a minimum of cost

  it is needless to add that these argu-
ments though appealing to the principles
of the querzal government and though
acted upon without delay were carefully
kept from public knowledge indeed it is
now believed that several political offend-
ers who in  were summarily sen-
tenced to the noose had been guilty of
nothing beyond some inadvertent sugges-
tions hinting at the governments new
project browbeaten and docile as the
peravian people had long been there was
no reason to suppose that they would
countenance this un-heard-of latest
atrocity of their leaders hence none but
a few high government officials a few
military chieftains a group of medieal
advisers a handful of great industrial-
ists and dr mandano himself had any
suspicion of what was in contemplation

    ven when the plan had actually been
    put into operation the law of abso-
in the footsteps of the wasp



lute secrecy prevailed and the govern-
ment proceeded by means of ruses and
subterfuges designed to throw dust into
the eyes of the people the only public
pronouncement was directly misleading
that in the interest of the public health
a state medical examination of all citizens
was to be undertaken beginning on a
particular date in the systemmatic man-
ner characteristic of the peravians all
individuals and families were to appear
at various assigned times before duly
constituted boards who were to compile
the most thoroughgoing health census
ever known to history little did the un-
suspecting common man realize that he
was being made to walk into a trap

  in a majority of cases it is true that
the trap was not allowed to spring merely
for the sake of appearance millions of
men were put through a superfluous phys-
ical examination but in hundreds of
thousands of instances-and eventually in
millions-the citizen in his ignorance
walked to a fate he would not knowingly
have accepted without a struggle

  hence it would occasionally happen
that some man-more often than not an
unemployed artizan or laborer-would
disappear after being summoned for ex-
amination and would not be heard of
again or some stout and brawny youth
who had been undergoing military train-
ing in a private or public corps would
vanish as if swallowed up by the earth or
a whole family-always of the poorer
classes and often previously dependent
upon charity-would fail to return from
its appointed examination and neighbors
would inquire in vain as to its where-
abouts officials when questioned would
merely shake their heads with a know-
nothing expression the police would
prove either unwilling or unable to be of
help the public press being dominated
by the querzal party would never so
much as mention any of the missing and
the rank and file of the populace if now

and then their suspicions were aroused
would find that a word indiscreetly ut-
tered would send them to a concentra-
tion camp if not to the executioner

  meanwhile in spite of the ferocious
restraints of the censorship bureau
strange rumors were making their way
through carefully guarded underground
channels tales were told that made the
hair of the listeners literally stand on
end tales that brought muttered oaths
and curses to many an indignant lip and
that caused many eyes to stare in amaze-
ment or incredulity one heard reports
of intricately winding galleries which
like modern catacombs were laden with
innumerable bodies-and one was told
that these were the bodies not of dead
men but of living one heard wild stories
of torture-rooms where physicians hav-
ing stripped their unwary patients for
physical examination would slyly inject
a hypodermic which caused the victims to
reel over like men stricken suddenly dead
and one was assured that by means of
a carefully arranged card system the
multitudes of slumbering individuals were
all placed and catalogued each with his
appropriate designation for example
 xw  automobile me-
chanic unemployed  yrs old at time of
suspended activities or  vt
 trained infantryman proficient
in rifle practice  yrs old at time of s
a or again tyu   and
  man wife and son dan-
gerous radicals   and  at time of

there was still another report
which more ghastly than the others
was heard now and then in secluded quar-
ters safe from the ears of governmeht
eavesdroppers this concerned a secret
incinerating chamber where each day
scores of unfortunates were brought for
cremation for mandanos man-pre-
server if these tales were to be believed


amazing stories

did not always accomplish its purpose
now and then some patient either be-
cause of a weak heart or nervous shock
or an excessive dose of the drug would
go beyond the stage of mere suspended
animation and the remains consequently
would have to be disposed of as quietly
as possible but such cases it was said
were exceptional and caused the officials
little worry in fact they were scarcely
in excess of one per cent of the total

  but although ominous whispered re-
ports continued to be circulated although
mysterious disappearances continued to
multiply and although such cases were
mostly confined to the humbler or non-
possessing classes the great majority of
the citizens remained placidly unaffected
so severe was the censorship that many
perhaps never heard the rumors at all
others hearing them refused to believe
or believing tacitly approved since the
new policy had sharply diminished the
burden of unemployment and of public
charity while the majority reduced to
the meekness of a jelly by the fury of
political repression and well knowing the
consequences of an unchecked tongue
chose not to inquire too closely into the
reports

  and so the years from  to 
slipped by and nothing had been done to
restrain the use of the man-preserver

  but in the latter year there occurred a
series of events which not even the wisest
could have foreseen

	 

it was in july of this year that ac-
cording to plans since disclosed the
querzal war department contemplated
its great offensive it was in july that
the usefulness of man-preserving was
to receive its culminating test it was in
july that peravia picking an excuse for
war simultaneously with the neighboring
lands of argenzela and bolador was to
revive millions of soldiers now waiting in
a state of suspended animation and by

one great overwhelming sweep was to
subdue both neighboring nations at the
same time multitudes of slumbering la-
borers were to be brought back to activity
so that wartime industry might be prop-
erly manned and the nation was accord-
ingly to have a strength beyond anything
dreamed of by her enemies or indicated
by her census reports

  such was the project and there is rea-
son to believe that it might have suc-
ceeded-had it not been for an unex-
pected factor

  that unexpected factor was to be found
in the person of captain juan cardenzos
perhaps the most persevering foe that the
querzal regime had ever encountered

  the record of cardenzos had been a
curious one decorated for heroism dur-
ing the equadorian war nearly thirty
years before he had become violently
anti-militant after the armistice he had
publicly destroyed his badges and decora-
tions and had worked ardently in the
cause of international understanding and
disarmament following the rise of
querzal to power he was condemned to
a concentration camp from which he
escaped after harrowing adventures
seeking refuge in the united states
where he remained for several years but
feeling that his native country needed him
he smuggled himself back over the bor-
der and living the existence of a hunted
creature carried on secret propaganda at
the daily risk of his life by means of
spies and underground emissaries-for he
had sympathizers even in the highest cir-
cles he gradually made himself the head
of a vast organized ring the so-called
league of free men which working
through subterranean channels was
vowed to overthrow the reigning tyranny

  a strangely assorted group they
were-disgruntled clerics communists
thwarted laborers disinherited intellec-
tuals women disenfranchised and adven-
turers ready to clutch at any straw yet
in the footsteps of the wasp



though they were so motley a crowd
though they seemed to have undertaken
a hopeless task and met with discourage-
ment after discouragement though many
of their members were seized by the police
and summarily executed they were held
together by the force of their convictions
and became a greater power than the
authorities were able to realize but it
was captain cardenzos that was their
guiding spirit and he it was that set off
the spark which precipitated the explo-
sion

ever since its formation the league
of free men had been investigating
rumors concerning the man-preserver
indeed it was probably through members
of the league that most of the rumors
started but at first its efforts had borne
little fruit other than in the martyrdom of
several league members by the execu-
tioners noose it was not until  that
any decisive action became possible for
it was not until that year that cardenzos
was in possession of the now-celebrated
devils secrets how the knowledge
came to him-whether through spies of
the league or through betrayal of the
government by its own servants-has
never been disclosed but in any case he
did gain information of the most reveal-
ing kind and was moved to passionate
indignation by word of the impending
war with argenzela and bolador and
at the same time his secret agents ac-
quired other information which made it
possible for him to plan a way to block
the war and incidentally to accomplish
the avowed purpose of the league by
crushing the querzalists forever

  the never-to-be-forgotten thirtieth of
july  was the date set for launch-
ing the league revolution one gasps
even in recollection to think by what
means and against what seemingly in-
superable odds cardenzos and his fol-
lowers began the revolt their exact

numbers will never be known but it is
conservatively estimated that they were
not more than five hundred in all when
on the evening of that memorable day
they quietly gathered before the gates of
a huge building on the outskirts of the
capital-a building which covering
many acres with its huge squat form
bore the simple designation government
warehouse ordinarily armed sentries
were parading before the entrance but
on this occasion they were conspicuously
lacking indeed the gate itself by what
might have seemed a bit of official care-
lessness swung invitingly ajar and when
cardenzos and his band strode in there
was no one to restrain them

  but mumbled passwords were quickly
interchanged with a waiting party within
and the newcomers as they surged
through the passageway cast casual
glances at a dozen sentries strewn about
them in a state of insensibility and
pressed hastily on to accomplish the
nights mission

guided bv maps and blueprints
they made their way through tortu-
ously winding electrically lighted pas-
sageways through labyrinthine corridors
that not only filled the building but
stretched underground in a long succes-
sion of basements and into apartments
suffused with vile-smelling concoctions
reminding one of a mortuary chamber
on every side of them in orderly recep-
tacles long rows of coffin-shaped boxes
were resting on shelves-scores of them
hundreds thousands ten of thousands-
so many that it made one dizzy merely
to look at them and beneath the cello-
phane covering of each box one could
distinguish a wax-like human face silent
and still as if in slumber

  working according to prearranged
plan and yet filled with the fury of des-
peration the rebels set about completing
their victory several of their number

were posted at various entrances as sen-
tinels for the danger was not at all re-
mote that their intrusion would be dis-
covered that they would be surrounded
imprisoned and sentenced to death
given a few hours leeway however and
they would liberate the country so they
believed and firm in this conviction
several hundred of the insurrectionists
drew each drew from his pocket little
vials filled with a black fluid and set to
work over the corpse-like forms lying be-
neath the cellophane

  strange beyond all words were the re-
sults a single drop of the liquid forced
into the veins of the sleeper would pro-
duce an almost magical effect instantly
the patients frame would be shaken with
a convulsive shudder his lips would draw
apart in a yawn his eyes would slowly
open and he would look up with a
drowsy bewildered expression from
which he would revive gradually into full
consciousness where am i would be
his first astonished exclamation and then
after an effort his mind would go back
to the moment of his official examination
the sudden stab of pain as the physician
taking him unawares had injected the
hyperdermic    and the ensuing black-
ness

  where am i he would repeat in
growing wonder and dread who are
you    where am i    what has
happened to me 

  you are with friends the league
member would rapidly explain for
years you have been sleeping betrayed
by your rulers now we the servants of
the people have come to save you we
have learned the secret of your enslave-
ment have discovered how to make the
drug that overcame you and the antidote
that has revived you see it is here in
these little vials now join us we will
show you how we have enough of the
medicine to restore a million men you
must help us bring your fellows back to

life then we will all join forces and
march upon the oppressors

fn some such words the league mem-
ber would appeal to each reviving
man sometimes the individual would be
immediately convinced and would en-
thusiastically join his saviors sometimes
he could be persuaded only with diffi-
culty but in every case the sight of the
long dimly lighted sepulchral corridors
with the innumerable coffin-like boxes
neatly packed on shelves in the alcoves
was enough to fill the restored person
with indignation against his betrayers and
with a desire to join the league

  in the course of one brief night ob-
viously a few hundred unassisted workr
ers would not have been able to revive a
great many thousands of sleepers yet
like the proverbial snowball rolling down-
hill their efforts expanded from a small
nucleus until all things were swept be-
fore them each awakened slumberer was
provided with a vial of the black fluid by
means of which he restored dozens of his
fellows to life and each of these in turn
resurrected others who resurrected
many more so that before morning the
halls and corridors of the whole vast
building and its underground annexes
were black with great surging masses of
men

  and all these great masses newly con-
verted to the cause of captain cardenzos
were loudly uttering the war-cry of the
league down with the oppressors
down with the oppressors onward for
the freedom of man onward onward
onward for the freedom of man

  

there are several things that have
never been satisfactorily explained
about the epoch-making first of
july  one is that captain carden-
zos an avowed pacifist should have re-
sorted to the use of arms-though it is
in the footsteps of the wasp



difficult to see bow he could have pre-
vailed unless willing to oppose force with
force at the crucial juncture another is
in what manner he succeeded in recruiting
an efficient army with such unparalleled
speed and securing arms and ammuni-
tion but the second question is more
easily answered than the first for it was
not really cardenzos that recruited the
army it was his enemies that recruited
it it must be remembered that more than
half the men had been trained as sol-
diers and intended by the government for
use in the war against argenzela and
bolador it must be remembered also
that abundant weapons and uniforms
were at hand in great underground ar-
mories conveniently placed near the man-
storage chambers so as to avoid unneces-
sary delay in case of hostilities and
when it is recalled that the revived men
by virtue of their very numbers could
easily batter down the doors of the armor-
ies and take possession one should have
no difficulty in understanding how cap-
tain cardenzos on the fateful first of
july was able to place himself at the
head of so great an army

  his military experience acquired dur-
irg the war a generation before was now
to serve him well and yet his triumph
was hardly a matter of military skill
wherever he went he was hailed urged
on and supported by crowds of people
long groaning beneath the querzal des-
potism and long powerless to defend
themselves and wherever he went the
enemy fled like rats hounded out of their
holes by terriers only in a few fortresses
and army strongholds did they dare to
defend themselves and even there they
could not long withstand the popular
fury for they were deserted by the
regular army on which they had placed
reliance after one or two battles in
which the masses though ill organized
prevailed by virtue of their irresistible en-
thusiasm the surviving querzalists scur-

  ried in multitudes across the national
frontiers while other multitudes were
taken prisoners or were brought down
by the guns or swords of the onsweeping
revolutionaries

  in-so-far as he could however cap-
tain cardenzos curbed all violence and
bloodshed thereby showing a self-res-
traint rare among victorious rebels but
he gave orders that all captives be scrupu-
lously guarded-and the sentence that he
inflicted upon them was not only unique
in history but represents one of the rar-
est strokes of ironic justice of which we
have any record no sooner had he been
established at the head of the league
government no sooner had he announced
the restoration of the peravian republic
and been elected president by an over-
whelming majority than he proposed and
carried out the punishment of scientific
incarceration upon all leaders of the de-
feated party upon the generals and in-
dustrialists who had urged the use of the
man-preserver and upon the physicians
who had lent their aid in paralyzing mil-
lions of unwilling victims

t ut what precisely was scientific
incarceration nothing more nor
less than man-preserving the paralyzing
of the culprit and his preservation in a
state of suspended animation in accord-
ance with the presidential decree fifty
thousand men and women were con-
demned to this novel penalty and all of
them undergoing a sentence of indefinite
duration were stored in those under-
ground labyrinths where their former vic-
tims had been secreted

and there to this day they remain all
of them it is said have been systematic-
ally checked numbered and registered in
a card catalogue so that one can easily tell
in what particular box and alcove to find
senor de mattas one-time baron of the
armament makers or general fernandez

  for eleven years already these notables

bering where they will never do damage

  to any human being and it is believed
that they may be left undisturbed for an-
other hundred years or perhaps even for
a thousand since the cardenzos regime
is still ruling successfully and no one has
any further desire to experiment with
the man-preserver or to revive any per-
sons who know too much of its dread
secrets

 north clods temple

by henry j kostkos

this is distinctively a story of the cosmic order not only that but the
composition of a planet this side of jupiter is brought in making us think
of the asteroids or planetoids as they are properly called those who like
tales of true adventure and of amazing happenings on this earth of ours
will specially enjoy this tale magnetism plays an important role in its plot
we have sciences devoted to the small and to microscopic organisms while
sometimes the very earth itself is taken as the basis of a narration and here
it is mother earth that gives us the story

illustrated by morey

out of the north came the
call strong and clear and
compelling straight into the
mind of professor darius
norton it penetrated as he
bent low over a specially designed mag-
netograph in his laboratory at the cos-
mopolitan museum of new york for
many days he had been tantalized by
the undecipherable impulses that came
from the instrument to agitate his brain
cells with weird bits of intelligence
then as if his nervous system had
become attuned to the flashes or waves
emanating from the device his senses
suddenly grasped the message and hav-
ing once learned its import he could not
rest it gripped him in its power with
an impulse as primordial and compelling
as the urge to live

  could he believe his senses yes
in the mind of darius norton there
was no doubt of the authenticity of that
message it came straight from the
far north from the base of the magnetic
pole and it would not give him
peace not until he obeyed its command

and followed it to its arctic source

  it was on a quiet sunday afternoon
of a lovely june day-one of those
rare days when the restless body and
mind of the professor was in tune
with the peaceful world he dozed off
momentarily on his laboratory stool then
awoke with a jar to find himself
sprawled on the floor not only was
he upset physically but his mental equi-
librium became a seething turmoil as
the message surged into his inner con-
sciousness rising and fading spasmodi-
cally as it conveyed these enigmatic
thoughts

  we are the historians of the people
of the magnetic god    from a far
planet we were hurled    penetrated
the crust of the earth    entrance in
tana fiord    into an ocean under
the ocean    our race is dying fast
   in the temple of the magnetic
god 

  it wasnt the message alone which
came as a translation of a strange high-
pitched foreign group of syllables into
understandable thought waves but a

  just as his fumbling hands finally focused his binoculars a geyser of water
  shot up into the air for what must have been a height of a hundred feet

completely enveloping the boat

compelling urge a hypnotic power that
gripped him and drew him to the mys-
terious and little understood regions of
the north magnetic pole darius nor-
ton was a man transformed with de-
sire his serenity had been caught in a
cyclone that tore it to shreds into the
chemistry of professor norton had been
poured a reagent that took complete con-
trol of him from that day on there was
but one meaning of life for him-ex-
plore this mystery-and do so at once

he operated the magnetograph again
and again but the instrument was
mute except for its orthodox function of
recording the strength and direction of
the magnetic force but he had enough
to go by a sixth sense told him that
he must first reach tana fiord on the
northern coast of far-off norway an
expedition that was it and with-
out further delay professor norton set
about to do something that under ordi-
nary circumstances his integrity would
never have permitted him to consider

  he summoned his staff to the confer-
ence room first and foremost was
raymond cullen his assistant and per-
haps the only man in whom he had
ever fully confided the gigantic frame
of darius norton his flaming red beard
his eyes that flashed out to the world
the fanatic impulses of pure genius that
motivated the man plus a tongue ever
ready to cast forth acid irony made it
exceedingly difficult to find any one pos-
sessing sufficient courage and tolerance
to penetrate to the mans inner self

  as director of the cosmopolitan mu-
seum he had a staff of archeologists
paleontologists and other scientists who
had been acclaimed the world over for
achievements in their respective fields
yet it was always the professors theory
that the best way to further develop
good men was to constantly keep them
on their toes and in fact to tread none

too lightly on those same toes by sub-
jecting all of their shortcomings to ruth-
less yet just criticism

  now he had to gain their support
and co-operation for in these depressed
times expeditions could not be authorized
even by the director of the worlds larg-
est museum without reasons more sub-
stantial than the desire to follow ethereal
thought waves coming from nowhere
he would have to resort to a subter-
fuge

  professor nortons eyes swept over
the faces of his staff and he placed his
long index finger on a map of the arctic
regions and boomed this was the
location of the north magnetic pole
during the archaeozoic era two thou-
sand million years ago when the great
planet that moved between the orbits of
mars and jupiter disintegrated into what
we now call the asteroids

  his colleagues waited in silence for
their director to continue

  as you know my observations and
calculations prove that during the period
of disintegration countless millions of
particles were violently hurled into space
and their path was such that many of
them were carried within the orbit of
the earth they struck our planet at
some heretofore unknown spot but now
since my calculations and magnetograph
observations have definitely fixed the lo-
cation of the shifting magnetic pole dur-
ing that period as the northernmost part
of norway on the shores of the arctic
sea it is there that i expect to find
fragments of that once great planet

  but what has the magnetic pole to
do with these meteorites  raymond
cullen puzzled

trofessor norton pointed his
bristling red beard toward his ques-
tioner the meteorites as you call
them are composed of highly magnetic
metals that were once a part of this


amazing stories

disintegrated planet his booming voice
was tinged with sarcasm that never
failed to exasperate his listeners and
as you know cullen magnets have the
peculiar property of attracting other
magnetic substances as a simple experi-
ment will convince you

  cullen reddened but he did not ap-
pear offended the others chuckled softly
to themselves so long as norton hadnt
directed his shaft of sarcasm at them
they could enjoy his sallies at the
expense of some one else but the next
moment they glanced wryly at one an-
other when the director stared fixedly
at each of them in turn and in the
tone of voice he would have used in
inquiring into the cause of some un-
pleasant phenomenon that perplexed him
growled i wonder gentlemen why it
is that i was destined to be endowed
with the most stupid staff ever assem-
bled under the roof of any museum
but you will undoubtedly be glad to
know that i will not be compelled to
rely upon your brains to produce any
epoch-making ideas when we rearch the
site of our excavations all we will
need there is some brawn here here
dont look at me with those bovine ex-
pressions ill make it plain you guys
will have to spit on your hands and
dig

  for a moment there was no sound
except the sharp intaking of breaths by
the eight men around the table then
a babble of excited voices broke out
how soon were they to leave how
many of them were to go would
they be finished before winter locked
the northland in its icy hold  they
were young again alive with the en-
thusiasm of youth for adventure in far
lands there was not an individual
who had not roamed back and forth
over the world many times in the per-
formance of his work yet each expedi-
tion was a fresh adventure holding 

the lure of many fascinating discoveries

  professor norton held up his hand
for silence we are scheduled to leave
in ten days gentlemen he boomed


the rusty old tramp steamer sea-
horse rounded north cape after
twenty-two pitching and groaning
days across the atlantic and up into
the arctic sea professor darius nor-
ton who had irritated himself into a
black gloom from which not even his
own witty flashes of irony served to
elevate him now became more tractable
as the end of the voyage loomed into
sight he had taken ray cullen and
four other associates from the museum
and in addition dr zuggler of the
university of copenhagen had joined
the expedition at stavanger norway
there was also a group of technicians
and artisans as well as laborers who
were to attend to the mechanical de-
tails of the heavy excavation work that
norton anticipated

  in spite of the directors dour manner
and his ever-ready sarcasm he had
endeared himself to all on board from
laborer to distinguished scientist there
was something lovable about the mans
idiosyncrasies backed as they were by
his superb intelligence they all noticed
how fanatic he was in his eagerness to
reach the site of the excavation and
long before the seahorse steamed into
the mouth of tana fiord his geologists
tools and instruments were packed in a
bag and on deck ready to be taken
ashore

  cullen-his voice rumbled loudly in
the silencc of the lonely sea and re-
echoed from the bleak shore line-
theres something here thats big-i feel
it cant keep my mind thinking ration-
ally it wanders to all sorts of im-
possible and crazy notions i feel-
he pitched his voice low until it was
no louder than a hoarse whisper-that
north gods temple



there is something pulling me to these
shores and that i will discover-

before norton could finish he
was hurled off his feet along with
every one else on deck by the sudden
stopping of the vessel which halted its
headway as effectively as if a giant hand
had clutched its keel there was no
impact as would have been the case
if a subterranean reef had been struck
or even the soft drag offered by ground-
ing on a bank of mud instead the
vessel was sucked down until her rails
were awash then released to bob up
like a cork while the propellers churned
the water futilely slowly the unseen
force swung the vessel around until her
bow pointed in the direction from which
she had come and as mysteriously as
she had stopped she churned ahead
again

  it all happened so fast that no cry
of alarm had been raised by those on
board now the men on deck rushed
to the stern to gaze shudderingly at a
seething maelstrom of boiling water
from which the vessel had emerged

  what in the name of the devil could
that have been cullen asked arche-
ologist gregg alongside of him

  gregg shook his head in bewilderment
then pointed excitedly toward a figure
leaning out over the stern

  good god cullen is that professor
norton he whispered not daring to
believe his eyes

  it was indeed the professor but the
man had been transformed into a strange
creature his huge frame had dwarfed
into the malformed body of a hunch-
back his defiantly flowing red beard
hung like a tattered curtain from a
trembling chin while the deeply tanned
color of his face had blanched into the
whiteness of the snow on the distant
mountain peaks

  cullen and gregg reached the taff-

rail not an instant too soon the pro-
fessor had strained his body far beyond
the limits of safety and even as he
lurched toward the water the two men
clutched his legs and hauled him in-
board the fact that he did not strug-
gle or even take notice of his rescuers
indicated that suicide had never entered
his mind it was some dreadful fascina-
tion some unknown and terrible force
that had almost drawn him into the
seething white waters toward what
cullen wondered

  they hurried him to his cabin with-
out being able to make head or tail of
his mutterings even after he had
been given a stiff jolt of scotch he
remained inarticulate and groped with
unseeing eyes at the bed-clothes in his
berth

  go call the doctor to look him over
-cullen drew gregg aside-and then
we had better take turns to see that
he stays put until we get ashore

when the expedition disembarked
on the rocky coast and set up
camp professor norton became quite
normal in his actions he directed the
work of erecting the tents and preparing
the equipment for excavating only by
his recurring fits of moodiness did he
give evidence of something weighing on
his mind and on frequent occasions
he stole away from the camp carrying
his magnetograph and made for the
headland from which he stared fixedly
out over the fiord toward the spot where
the ship had been held fast by that mys-
terious force it was during these pe-
riods that ray cullen so worried about
the red-bearded giant that he invariably
stalked him to the bluff managing to
keep out of sight yet staying close
enough to be able to reach the profes-
sors side almost instantly if needed

  whether by design or coincidence
about a week after the party had landed


amazing stories

on the bleak northern shore norton
dispatched cullen with a group of labor-
ers to start the excavation work at a
point he designated some distance in-
land as gregg was also assigned to
the group there was no one to whom
cullen could confide his fears for the
professors safety so it was with mis-
giving that he got under way with his
men and equipment no sooner had the
party disappeared from sight beyond the
ridge of the hill than norton hastened
for the shore where the metal rowboat
belonging to the expedition was beached

  he hunched his giant frame to the
task and hauled the heavy craft down
over the rock-strewn beach into the
water with sinewy arms he sped the
boat over the waves straight for the spot
upon which he had focused his gleam-
ing eyes for many days in his eager-
ness to reach this mysterious location
he timed his strokes in a loud booming
voice that penetrated the silence of the
bleak north one two one two one
two  he chanted as his oars flew
over the water

  back beyond the hill cullen stopped
to listen

  hear that gregg

  its professor norton the archeolo-
gist cried with conviction

  cullen glanced at the man signifi-
cantly im going back there some-
things up and he was off on a run
without waiting for greggs reply gregg
joined him

  panting for breath ray reached the
headland and scanned the choppy waters
of the fiord almost a mile out he spot-
ted a tiny object bobbing up and down
as it rose on the crest of a wave then
disappeared into the trough of the sea
there was no doubt in his mind that
it was the rowboat with norton in it
as there was no other human being in
that vicinity who could have been out
upon the water and the fact that the

boat was directly over the spot where
the seahorse had been held helpless

verified his suspicion

just as his fumbling hands finally
focused his binoculars a geyser of
water shot up into the air for what
must have been a height of a hundred
feet completely enveloping the boat
when the geyser subsided in a seething
whirlpool the boat and its red-bearded
occupant had vanished from sight

  good lord cullen exclaimed then
ran like mad toward the camp for help
in launching the heavy motor boat that
was lying far up on the beach the
entire population of the camp rushed
down and hauled the vessel out into the
fiord for two hours the boat chugged
its way back and forth across the stretch
of water where cullen last saw norton
but without any results not a single
drifting object could they find which
had belonged to the ill-fated professor
it was a sorrowful group of individuals
that dragged slowly back into camp to
mourn the mysterious loss of their
leader



when professor norton reached
the mouth of the fiord his mind
suddenly became rational the
mysterious force this obsession that had
numbed his sound reasoning and trans-
formed his mind into a thing of blind
impulse the inexplicable power that had
drawn him to this horrible yet fasci-
nating spot now left him at once he
realized the danger of his position but
it was too late to do anything

  with a hiss like the bursting of a
hundred water mains a geyser of spray
and water shot up all around him as
an irresistible whirpool caught his boat
in its vortex and twirled it around with
the speed of a swift moving centrifuge
the cry of anguish that escaped from
nortons lips was drowned in the cres-
north gods temple



cendo of swirling waters that sucked his
vessel down into its funnel

  the scientists mind went blank as
he saw himself sinking into a bottomless
pit of green water when he came to
his senses norton was still in the metal
row boat but he could see absolutely
nothing either ahead behind or above
in fact were it not for the swish of
water against the sides of the boat he
would have sworn that he had landed in
a coal bin in a dark cellar at midnight

  he groped his way cautiously toward
the bow and then did an amazing thing
from a locker under the forward seat
he pulled out a dish shaped object with
wires dangling from it then felt around
in the dark until his fingers touched
a switch as he snapped it a beam shot
from the reflector he held and flooded
the course of his boat with a brilliant
white light stretching into the distance
as far as the powerful rays could pen-
etrate was a broad body of inky water
black and foreboding as he swung
the searchlight the beams played upon
rocky walls and a high vaulted ceiling

  professor norton was in a subter-
ranean sea moving along at a tremen-
dous rate of speed the walls flashing
past him like the sides of a tunnel
through which an express train was
speeding

  he threw some chips of wood over-
board in an instant they dropped be-
hind and were lost to sight there
was no doubt about it his vessel was
being attracted by a powerful magnetic
force as there was absolutely no cur-
rent drift in the direction he was
traveling

  professor norton chuckled softly to
himself if i had told cullen and the
rest of the gang that i expected all this
they would have had me in a strait-
jacket before i could have finished my
story

  then he consulted a portable magneto-

graph he fished out of the locker along
with a box of crackers with which he
had secretly stocked the row boat for
just such an adventure

m the magnetic force is stronger
than i had estimated proves
that slide-rule jugglery doesnt always
pull the right number of rabbits out of
the hat

  he amused himself while leisurely
crunching a cracker by flashing the
search-light around and studying the
changing character of the subterranean
passage there was no fear that the
light would be extinguished for lack of
power as he had provided an ingenious
generator that operated when the swift-
moving field coils in the boat cut the
intensive magnetic lines of force in the
tunnel green slime-covered walls
dripping with moisture jutting rocks
that reached out their sharp points to
tear at him the echoes of the lapping
waters black slimy shapes that rose to
the surface then disappeared into the
inky water-all these would have un-
nerved a man made of less stout stuff
than the red-bearded giant who impas-
sively studied every passing character-
istic on his strange journey the tem-
perature of the water was delightfully
warm to his touch

  probably volcanic origin he mused
its bound to become steaming hot be-
fore long

  but in this he was mistaken the
temperature of the water dropped stead-
ily the air in the passage became chilly
and finally frost appeared on the rocky
ledges professor norton donned the
parka he had previously removed and
was thankful for its comforting warmth

  soon slabs of floating ice appeared
first as white patches in the distance
then the floes became denser until nor-
ton peered with some alarm ahead of
him to see a solidly frozen sheet stretch-


amazing stories

ing blue-white into the remote distance

  it was only a matter of seconds be-
fore he would be hurled at express
speed against this sheet of ice which
would surely crumple the thin metal
hull as if it were an egg shell he had
to act quickly no time to lose now
just as the little vessel reached the
solid ice he threw his weight into the
stern and the bow of the craft shot
high into the air the bottom struck
with a sickening thud that threw nor-
tons head forward until he thought that
it had parted company with his spine
then at slackened speed the boat con-
tinued over the rough ice pack to the
smooth frozen surface over which it
fairly zoomed like a swift flying bird
the powerful force had converted the
metal craft into an ice-boat that slid
along on its keel strips norton took
a deep breath of relief then huddled
in the bottom with the searchlight pressed
close to his body for warmth

he consulted his black note book
yes at the estimated rate of sev-
enty-five miles an hour in a westerly
direction he would reach his destination
in about fifty hours after passing be-
neath the arctic ocean glacier-covered
greenland baffin bay baffin land and
the gulf of boothia but fifty hours
spent in this weird lonely place speed-
ing like mad toward an unknown des-
tination was not any too pleasant to
contemplate even for such a staunch-
hearted scientist as norton if he had
only taken cullen into his confidence
he was sure that his good friend would
have joined him without an instants
hesitation but now it was too late
the song of the runners over the ice
made him drowsy he dozed off and
finally fell into a deep sleep

  crunch splash

  his slumber was brought to an abrupt
end by the boat breaking through the

ice and sailing beyond into open water
the frozen sheet had terminated and
his course now lay through water once
again but a new element entered to
disturb his equilibrium the hours of
friction over the ice had worn the keel
of the boat down until it traveled along
on the unprotected plates of the bottom
wearing the metal so thin that the water
squirted into the boat in a heavy spray

  norton seized a scoop and began to
bail furiously not daring to stop even
long enough to take his bearings how
long he had slept or how far he had
traveled during that time he had no way
of determining

  it was nip and tuck now between the
rise of the water in the bottom of the
boat and the speed with which he
could work the scoop hour after hour
he kept bailing but it was a losing fight
slowly the water rose first to his
ankles next half way up his leg-thdn
the light went out the generator which
he had failed to inclose in a waterproof
housing had been short-circuited true
there wras his pocket flashlight but he
must conserve the precious batteries for
future emergencies for only god knew
when he would be able to find his way
out of this dismal subterranean chamber

ttrith head bent low and his mind
on the immediate task of bailing
norton did not see the dark solid mass
that loomed up ahead steadily the
boat bore down upon this obstruction a
collision was inevitable as the bow of
the vessel crashed into an unyielding
substance the professor jerked his head
around and tried to jump but it was too
late with irresistible force the boat tele-
scoped itself into buckled and twisted
steel plates nortons body fetched up
hard against a hard substance and every-
thing went black

  slowly consciousness returned to the
man living fires were searing his
north gods temple



frame warmfi red blood oozed from a
dozen cuts and scratches one arm hung
immobile and useless with a broken col-
lar-bone protruding through the torn
flesh

  looking around with dazed eyes nor-
ton found himself on a narrow plateau
above the reach of the water what re-
mained of the boat had probably sunk
from sight when he was hurled clear
of the wreckage

  cautiously he stretched out one leg
then the other they at least were
intact after a half dozen exhausting
attempts he was able to raise his body
on his shaky legs and hold himself erect
by leaning heavily against a cold hard
wall now he became curious the
scientist within him had taken control
over the obstacle of physical pain and
mental fatigue he ran his hand up
and down the side of the massive ob-
ject it was glass-smooth to the touch
with his good arm he managed to reach
the flashlight in his pocket luckily it
had escaped destruction

  he swept the beam upward there
towering some two hundred feet above
him was an obelisk-like tower of gleam-
ing ebony a hundred windows cut
its smooth surface while at the top
crowning the summit was a huge ball
studded with crystal windows that
flashed back his light in a cascade of
spectral colors

  nortons eyes gleamed writh a fanatic
fire here was his goal the proof that
his researches and experiments had not
been misdirected

  the base of the obelisk flared out to
the platform on which he stood and
then disappeared from sight under the
inky water how much of it was below
the surface norton had no means of
knowing but he judged that at least
seventy-five feet would be needed to
stably support the mass of the huge
tower

  when he attempted to walk he found
his back glued to the wall he tugged
and pulled frantically but to no avail
then he grinned sheepishly and reached
around for an object in his hip pocket
the heavy automatic pistol he pulled out
immediately flew from his grasp crashed
solidly against the wall and stuck there
it was the steel of the pistol which had
held him he wras now released and
free

  magnetite although a thousand
times more powerful he exclaimed ex-
amining the substance closely yet it is
different from any mineral found on
our earth yes i am positive that this
structure was hurled from some far
planet and he whispered in an awed
voice the message was right it must
be the temple of the magnetic god

  working his way cautiously around
the base of the structure which he
found to be octagonal and approximately
fifty feet across he came to the entrance
he was seeking a circular doorway
gloomy and uninviting led to the inside
of the temple he had left his pistol
adhering to the outer wall yet without
any thought of fear he boldly entered
and flashed his light around the next
moment he regretted his lack of caution

  as he turned his head he drew back
 with a jump to stare right into
the vacant eye sockets of a monstrous
skull and strewn about within the
chamber were hundreds of other skulls
and bones of the creatures who had
worshipped and died here the air was
dank with the odor of death and decay
the walls wrere festooned with rotted
draperies the floor slimy from the ebb
and flow of the water that had flooded
the place periodically

  he nerved himself to examine the re-
mains more closely the bones were
green with mould and crumbled to pow-
der at his touch it was evident at a


amazing stories

glance that the creatures who had used
the temple for worship were not human
beings in any sense of the word as ap-
plied upon the earth

  the skull was massive measuring
more than a foot across and shaped not
unlike that of a huge bird yet it had a
high and deep cranium denoting the
possession of an enormous degree of in-
telligence the thorax was short and
the thigh bones of the four legs un-
believably small but the two arms
terminating in delicate phalanges in-
dicated that the creature had twelve ex-
tremely sensitive fingers that could only
have been possessed by a race skilled in
performing precision work or operating
complicated machines

  glancing up from the bones at his
feet professor nortons eyes riveted
themselves upon a circular opening in
the middle of the vaulted roof the
opening appeared small to him below
but it was undoubtedly large enough
to admit the priests of the temple to the
chambers where they had lived and
worked the shaft was as smooth as
the bore of a shot gun and he could
detect no means of reaching it to gain
access to the upper part of the temple

  they might have used ladders he
mused but creatures possessing the
intelligence of these surely must have
employed a more efficient system-some
type of elevator perhaps

  this thought gave him an idea he
took out his pocket knife and held it in
the palm of his hand whizz it was
whisked aloft straight into the shaft

  thats the answer a magnetic ele-
vator now to find the car

 he kicked away some rubbish and
bones and discovered a circular trap
door directly below the shaft at first
he imagined that it led to the basement
of the structure but he now realized that
it had some bearing upon the mode of

ascent after considerable scratching
around he found the combination and
as he pushed a button the trap-door sank
down slightly then slid aside revealing
a car that resembled a huge iron pot
boldly he stepped into it and taking a
chance pulled a lever that projected
from its side at once the released
vehicle shot up into the air and entered
the opening like the plunger of a
solenoid up it went until it came to
rest at the first level

  eagerly norton stepped out into a
laboratory that was filled with strange
looking machinery and instruments
with the eagerness of a small boy in
a toy shop the red-bearded scientist
minutely examined ever item and with
fond hands caressed the fine mechanisms
some of them he understood but there
was much more that puzzled him

  the problem of descending in the
elevator was solved when after trying the
various controls in the car he discovered
the one that served to neutralize the mag-
netic force permitting the car to drop
by gravity

  on an upper level he found the elec-
trical generating plant in an operative
condition fortunately all the metals
used by these creatures were non-cor-
rosive which accounted for the perfect
preservation of the equipment he
threw a switch and at once the room
and in fact the entire tower lit up
with a soft sea-green light that illum-
inated perfectly without dazzling the
eyes now he had sufficient light to
continue his search for the thing that
had lured him into making this perilous
journey-the records of the magnetic
god which he instinctively felt must be
hidden somewhere in this very tower

tt was three days before his search
- was rewarded by finding the records
in a sealed chamber at the summit of
the temple the records consisted of a
north gods temple



strip of metal tape wound on a reel like
a motion picture film the tape ran
through a complicated looking apparatus
composed of coils of wire and tubes to
reappear on a take-up reel at the other
end and near by was the fast disinte-
grating remains of the last of the mag-
netic people judging by the condition
of its body it must have been alive not
many months ago

  this device must be the one that
translates the magnetic impressions into
thought waves and was apparently
operated recently by this creature to
send out the very waves that i was able
to intercept with my magnetograph back
in the museum now to get it working
again   

  this however was no easy task day
after day he drove his pain-racked body
to the almost helpless problem of dis-
covering the riddle of this complicated
piece of apparatus it was not until
three weeks that the tape gave up its
secret but in his weakened condition
norton felt but scant triumph his
wounds pained excruciatingly and the
broken collar-bone was an added source
of worry although he had managed to
bind his arm securely to avoid moving
it

  at first he had faced starvation with
a stoical calmness but the pangs of
hunger had driven him to swallow some
pills that appeared palatable whereupon
he discovered that they contained all the
nourishment he would need for many
days

  now into the brain of the red-bearded
scientist the machine hashed the story
of the great race who had worshipped
in the temple of the magnetic god and
these thought-waves impressed upon his
mind the struggles the triumphs the
ultimate disasters that will always be
the lot of all creatures of the universe

  the records told of a far planet that

once moved majestically between the
orbits of mars and jupiter harboring a
race of intelligent and scientifically ad-
vanced people who chose for their god
that father of all power magnetism
then came the catastrophe    the fierce
terrifying temblors of their planet   
its cleavage into a million fragments
which were hurled far into space   
the landing of the temple upon the
planet earth in what was now called
tana fiord deep into the bowels of
the earth into a subterranean sea the
majestic temple bored its way carrying
its load of creatures during its swift
passage the highly magnetized temple
induced its magnetism into the body of
iron ore through which it passed and it
was this force that held the seahorse
in its grip and pulled professor nortons
boat into the passage for on the earth
there was no magnetic force prior to the
coming of the temple of the magnetic
god this was the beginning the origin
of the mysterious terrestrial magnetism

  gradually the creatures adapted them-
selves to the strange underground ex-
istence and managed to survive they
soon discovered that their huge magnetic
temple appeared to change its location
periodically this was explained by
the tendency of the magnetic drag
created by the tower to hold it station-
ary while the earth whirled around and
away from it on its axis the drag
served to retard it so that it apparently
made a complete circle around the
north axis of the globe every 
years

  exactly the same period as the sec-
ular change of declination of the mag-
netic pole norton exclaimed i won-
der-

  	it has been long known that the magnetic north pole
does not coincide with the true north pole or the end of
the earths axis this affects the course of ships at sea
and is called declination or variation not only does this
variation differ in various parts of the earth but it is
constantly shifting in a westerly direction at the rate of
one complete cycle in  years at present the north
magnetic pole is on boothia peninsula in canada ap-
proximately  north latitude and  west longitude


amazing stories

lt is musings were interrupted by
an awesome swirling sound he
looked down from the window at the
top of the temple to see the black water
surging upwards at an alarming rate
down in the lower chambers the re-
mains of the magnetic creatures the
machinery and the debris were already
swishing about now the water reached
the generators the lights grew dim and
went out norton climbed up high in
the dome of the temple clinging to a
projecting ledge with his good arm
with blood-shot eyes he watched the
black inky fluid rush in through the
elevator shaft wash away the translator
machines and the precious records of
the magnetic god and reach relentlessly
upward to gather him in its clutches

  suddenly norton held his breath and
listened clearly he could hear it or
was it a delusion coming from far
off was the screech of the seahorses
whistle

 the temple of the magnetic god
swayed dangerously as darius norton
struggled desperately to maintain his
precarious hold then the water reached
for him and sucked him into the seething

maelstrom to disappear with a horrify-
ing scream   

	 

cullen stood on the bridge of
the seahorse when she slowly
steamed into a cove on boothia
peninsula tucked away in professor
nortons duffle bag he found a hastily
scrawled note it read

  it is futile to try to find me as by
the time you read this i will be dead or
many miles from here there is one
chance leave here at once and proceed
to boothia peninsula to site of present
magnetic north pole and wait norton
now cullen was taking readings of
the force from the near-by magnetic pole
with a unifilar magnetometer when the
needle of the instrument began to swing
wildly in his excitement he yanked the
whistle cord to call his colleagues the
screech of the whistle reverberated over
the silent wastes and re-echoed from the
distant ice caps it reached into the far
corners of the north country and deep
into the bowels of the earth where the
man who had discovered the secret of
the magnetic pole sank with his secret
into the waters that buried him forever
within the north gods temple

otto von guericke-phlogiston

  we publish a most interesting letter from
mr john a campbell jr some months ago
in an editorial we spoke of an error in me-
chanics which was perpetrated by von guericke
in having one team of horses pull against an-
other in demonstrating the magdeburg hemis-
pheres eight horses would have done as well
as sixteen if he had tied his hemispheres to a
tree

  your editorial interested me as usual but
i disagree with your point on von guerickes
hemispheres i always felt the old boy was a
darned good showman as well as a scientist
hitching sixteen horses against each other is
at least twice as spectacular as eight horses and
a tree if i had been in his place i would do
the same there is more energy in a pint of
gasoline than in a stick of dynamite-but most
people dont believe it

  and here is an interesting point on the old
phlogiston theory that i read recently re-
member that phlogiston didnt really flourish
after the weight experiments so the futile at-
tempts made to carry it over arent true criteria
of its worth

  but-for phlogiston substitute the phrase
potential energy and the old boys were dead
right they would say carbon-phlogiston-
carbon dioxide while we now agree that
carbon-potential energy-carbon dioxide in
other words phlogiston was potential energy

  as a hobby mainly im working on a fuel
battery i have one made up in a water glass
that will give as high as  watts per cell and
three cells run a flashlight bulb-it polarizes
though-but nevertheless it is a fuel battery

  shot into space

 by isaac r nathanson

this is a very interesting story of what might happen in the future to a high-
speed rocket plane a runaway horse is really a pretty serious thing in many
cases but he covers his mile at a mere fraction of the rate of a rocket plane
and this story tells us the adventures of some brave men who were rocketed

   off into space

  illustrated by morey

roosevelt field was a

scene of buzzing excitement
a vast multitude had gathered
to witness the daring pioneers

        	take off in their new rocket-
plane on the widely heralded flight to
europe in three hours

  from all sides they came on foot and
by motor by train by airplane and every
other conveyance crowding the highways
and byways and every approach to the
famous landing-field eager and curious
to be on hand for the epochal event an
army of guards were heroically battling
to keep the turbulent masses from over-
running the entire field itching fingers
idle hands were with difficulty kept at a
proper distance from the precious plane

  three hours to europe a combina-
tion rocket-plane under full control that
was to cleave through the rarified atmos-
phere twenty to fifty miles above the
earths surface at unheard of speed

  it had never been tried before could
they do it would they burst to pieces
would they land alive on every hand
doubts and wonder were freely expressed
the tense excitement attaining a high
pitch as the moment for the great take-
off drew near

  at one end of the field carefully
cleared of all obstructions rested the

meteor her shining wings proudly poised
like some huge bird ready for flight on
her glistening sides emblazoned the con-
fident legend america to europe in
three hours near the entrance stood
the two men who were about to make
history joshua malcolm inventor and
pilot of the meteor and his aid and co-
pilot edward king

  the great moment had arrived every-
thing was in readiness with a wave of
the hand to the expectant multitude the
brave aviators stepped inside and closed
the hermetically sealed entrance to the
double-shelled body the faint hum of
the air-conditioning machinery inside
could be heard the two aviators at the
controls were visible through the quart-
zite ports a strange silence fell on the
immense multitude

  at the signal the propellers began to
spin the meteor moved forward gath-
ered momentum took off lightly as a
feather and engines roaring sailed
away

  a thousand feet up and rising steadily
her stern rocket tubes suddenly flared
up up and away the meteor shot leav-
ing behind a long blazing trail from her
fiery rockets and soon disappeared into
the azure deeps of the sky

  fifty miles up the powerful liquid
	amazing stobies

 slowly he backed away and stood in the corner of the cabin cowed into
 furious submission by the levelled automatic in the hands of his companion
shot into space



propellant hissing from the rocket tubes
with explosive force was driving the
vessel toward its goal in distant france
at a speed of upwards of twelve hundred
miles per hour soon they were far out
over the billowing atlantic the steady
thrust of their rocket tubes speeding them
on and on higher and faster than any
human being had ever gone before

  they had been on the way half an
hour josh malcolm and ed king as they
sat at the controls thrilling at their suc-
cess so far inside their vessel every-
thing was perfectly comfortable the
means for controlling the air pressure
and temperature necessary to withstand
the conditions which obtain at such ex-
treme heights were operating perfectly

  suddenly a frightful explosion shook
the machine as if some giant hand had
all at once picked them up they felt
themselves hurled forward like a shot
the two men were thrown headlong
stunned into blank unconsciousness

for a long time they were totally
oblivious to all that was transpiring
had an observer been present he would
have thought both had been killed by
the sudden shock

  josh malcolm was the first to come to
his senses dazedly he stirred and looked
about him out of blood-shot eyes a
fearful bump showed on his forehead
blood was oozing from an ugly gash in
the scalp head aching abominably an
excruciating pain in his right shoulder
he found it hard to collect his thoughts
and strove to rise but fell back with a
groan

  gradually his senses came back he re-
membered he sat up supporting him-
self unsteadily and looked around
heaven what had happened everything
inside the meteor seemed as before his
eyes roved to where ed king was lying
all in a heap still unconscious-or dead
to malcolms dazed senses the position

in which the other lay struck him as
ludicrous in the extreme face turned
sideways on the floor knees grotesquely
drawn up under him his position against
the corner of the wall preventing him
from rolling over a pool of blood
trickled on the floor

  collecting himself josh tried to walk
toward his fallen comrade felt himself
queerly light swayed dizzily and fell
featherlike to the floor everything was
swimming and turning yet oddly
enough he had a sensation of utter calm
and rest as if they had landed some-
where

  he closed his eyes for a few moments
then feeling better raised himself to a
sitting position and looked around he
was strangely puzzled by what greeted
his eyes outside the sky was a dead
black brilliantly studded with stars that
blazed as he had never seen them blaze
before and yet-and this puzzled him
the more-brilliant sunshine was stream-
ing in through the quartz-glass ports on
the startboard side otherwise outside
of the soft purring of the air-conditioning
machinery everything was quiet as a
tomb

  still puzzled and wondering whether
he was still in the flesh or only in the
spirit he made his way unsteadily with
a feeling of utter weightlessness to where
his companion lay ed was breathing
from a frightful gash on his head and
from battered mouth blood was flowing
quickly as he could josh stanched the
flow the unconscious man slowly re-
vived his eyes rolling wildly with pain
and fright

  presently with clearing minds they
took stock of themselves both were still
weak and dizzy from the shock and loss
of blood but otherwise they suffered
from no broken bones nor serious injury

  upon looking out of the ports they
beheld an amazing sight aft of the
meteor looming indescribably large was


amazing stories

a brilliant globe many times larger than
the full moon the wanly shining lunar
orb by its side dwarfed and paled into
insignificance by the size and brilliancy
of the larger globe in unbelieving amaze-
ment they stood and gazed on the won-
derful spectacle  the truth beginning to
dawn on their surprised senses

  heavens exclaimed josh malcolm
it looks as if we have shot away from
the earth altogether

a strange unlooked for thing had
happened indeed something had
gone wrong causing an enormous amount
of the liquid propellant to explode all in
one charge instead of firing steadily and
under control hurling the speeding me-
teor far out into space away from the
earth the terrific force of the explosion
tore away a large portion of the stern
including some of the rocket tubes but
fortunately leaving intact the air-tight
cabin and other vital parts

  experienced scientist and navigator
that he was it did not take josh malcolm
very long to calculate within fairly close
limits their true position in space and
whither they were going-and they were
not heading for the earth

  well- questioningly from ed
king who stood near as the other pushed
back the sheets of paper on which he
had just completed a long series of math-
ematical calculations how do we
stand 

  josh looked up stared steadily at his
companion a serious expression in his
dark brown eyes seemingly hesitant about
speaking his thoughts

  well what have you figured out ed
spoke up impatiently are we on the way
to heaven or-

  ed im afraid were in for it im
loth to tell you where we are going but
were not bound for our world in fact
were not going anywhere in particular
-just going

  wthat do you mean

  i mean that we are in his hands-
god help us

  ed stared at josh in an uncomprehend-
ing manner a look of terror gradually
bulging his eyes wide open

  we are now about thirty thousand
miles from the earth explained josh
to his terrified companion and still re-
ceding with the rate due to an initial
velocity of  miles per second as
near as i can figure out the sudden ex-
plosion of an enormous amount of the
liquid propellant coming just as we were
already moving through the vacuous at-
mosphere at twelve hundred miles an hour
clip shot up far out into space lucky
we werent killed outright-perhaps un-
lucky he added gloomily a trifle
larger explosion or at the rate of 
miles per second and we should have
left the gravitational pull of the earth
forever-although we are just as bad off
either way the meteor is now a satellite
of the earth-at least for a time

  but isnt there some way we may
guide her back to the earth  came croak-
ingly from ed who seemed to shrink
within himself

  josh shook his head mournfully none
that i can see this vessel was not de-
signed for that purpose if i start the
rocket tubes again well only shoot along
faster and leave the earth altogether at
present i can see no way to change our
line of movement

  the expression of wild terror in eds
countenance heightened and he turned
away god but im thirsty he ex-
claimed presently i must have a drink
wait ed go slow josh cried jump-
ing up excitedly the effort bouncing him
clear to the ceiling from which he fell
slow-motion-like back to the floor be-
wildered and surprised at his inability to
control his motions you know our
supply is very limited weve got to con-
serve or-
shot into space



t dont give a damn-the sooner
j over with it the better besides im
terribly thirsty and ive got to have a
drink he looked belligerently at his
companion

  well you know what i mean ed
i realize youre thirsty after your loss of
blood and so am i but we must ration

our supply sensibly otherwise- with

this josh with some difficulty got be-
tween ed and the all too mournfully
small container carefully he drew a
small quantity of the precious fluid and
handed it to ed who drank eagerly josh
drew an equally small portion and drank
himself

  then they ruefully examined their all
too meager larder not counting on an
extended trip they had taken along a
limited quantity of food in fact ed had
thought it foolish to take along anything
but a few sandwiches at the most but
josh who was of an extremely provident
nature had decided it prudent in the
possibility of a forced landing to take
along a small supply of food and water

  a careful analysis of their dreadful
situation disclosed that with extreme hus-
banding they had food for a few days
water for only about a week and pro-
viding nothing went wrong with the air-
conditioning machinery enough air and
reserve oxygen to last twelve days at the
very outside

arther and farther from the
planet circled the two unfortunate
men in their craft their little world
an infinitesimal speck in the immensities
of space

  for days it had now been going on
the same cramped life the same dreadful
doom clutching at their hearts to the
despairing aviators it seemed that they
were besieged-the mighty power of the
infinite outside grimly waiting for their
end

the huge ball of the earth gradually

shrinking in size hung in the dark depths
of space so tantalizingly near it seemed
it loomed big and beautiful the ever
changing outlines on its surface appear-
ing disappearing now becoming sharp
here and there hazy and melting the
smaller ball of the moon seemed pale and
insignificant beside the kaleidoscopic as-
pect of the brilliantly colorful primary

  but the two doomed pioneers now had
no eye nor thought for the magnificent
spectacle thus vouchsafed to no other
living men hunger and thirst were tear-
ing at their vitals stark fear and linger-
ing death within pitiless cold space with-
out

  of the two josh malcolm was hold-
ing out better as men of stronger mind
and nerve usually do he took the dread-
ful predicament with remarkable stoicism
the other however was becoming in-
creasingly restless stark terror stamping
him with its indelible mark

  carefully and meticulously josh ra-
tioned out their dreadfully fast dwindling
supply of food and water the while his
companion watched his every move with
jealous eyes morsel by morsel drop by
drop the tiniest crumb carefully re-
trieved their tongues licking the smallest
drop

  i cant stand this confounded thirst
any longer ed exclaimed often and
again an insane look in his eyes

  more than once josh forcibly had to
restrain the thirst-maddened man from
draining the pitifully limited supply still
on hand at times they came near to
blows josh slept fitfully with one eye
literally open the precious remainder of
food and water at his side more than
once he barely prevented the other from
helping himself while he slept awaken-
ing just in time to frustrate eds selfish
attempt the last time he was forced
to strike the maddened man a sharp blow
on the face to cause him to desist and
a fight was narrowly averted


amazing stories

  we might as well eat and drink what
is left ed said and end it all the
sooner i cant stand it

  to these demands josh was adamant
his was the type of character that holds
out unflinchingly to the end never giv-
ing up he continued a close watch on
his companion

  interminably the long minutes and the
hours dragged by each minute a day
each hour a year  would the end never
come

three days since their last crumb
had been consumed they were
famished and weak from hunger a few
small rations of water still remained to
them and when that was gone    al-
ready they were drawing on their last
reserve of compressed air and oxygen
the air inside was none too pure

  every plan of forcing their living tomb
earthward was futile in fact there was
no way for them to do so they had no
equipment even for going outside-no
such contingency had been counted on by
the inventor the end now could not be
far off

  josh still kept up his daily observa-
tions doggedly making calculations he
found that the radial velocity of the
meteor was gradually diminishing to
zero by this time having receded to about
 miles from the earth-fortunate-
ly in a direction away from the orbit of
the moon

  then one day as days were counted by
his chronometer his face lightened up
eagerly he went over his equations

  ed he shouted joyfully we are
drawing closer to the earth

  ed stirred himself from his torpor
advanced eagerly toward josh are you
sure are you sure his hands opened
and closed spasmodically

  and then after a further look at his
calculations joshs face fell in hopeless
dejection im sorry to have raised

false hopes ed he spoke sadly but i
guess i rejoiced too soon i find that
though our centrifugal force is not equal
to the gravitational pull of the earth and
though as a consequence we are now be-
ginning to fall back to it-i fear too
slowly to save us it will take about a
week before we approach the upper at-
mosphere close enough for our wings to
take hold and maneuver a landing by
that time  i dont think we shall be
alive

  it was true at first imperceptibly
then at an accelerating rate the meteor
was drawing closer and closer to the
earth the initial momentum of its
radial component was exhausted gravita-
tion was now forcing it earthward at
first slowly then faster and faster until
it would approach the planet with the
same velocity of  miles per second
with which it departed

  josh took careful stock of their remain-
ing few drinks of water and small supply
of air only enough air for five days
at the most ed we may last without
food-but the water and air    not
enough for two we are doomed
you mean-our present supply is
just enough for-for-that one could
survive 

  josh nodded i think so

  but no chance for the two of us
the other shook his head negatively
silently he turned to one of the ports
and stood staring long and hopelessly at
the pitiless emptiness without

  he heard a movement behind him and
wheeled around

tve just got to have a drink of that
  - water

  not time yet ed in three hours
but i tell you i must have a drink
in three hours we shall each take two
swallows for gods sake ed keep your

senses

  well then lets toss up its either you
shot into space



or i there is not enough air and water
for two that would give one of us at
least a chance to come through and
he looked craftily at josh greed and
mad cunning playing on his features
lets draw and whoever loses can put
himself out with your automatic id
rather die than go on any longer where
there is no hope

  josh shook his head ill not commit
murder or suicide its share and share
alike to the last drop and the last breath

  youre a fool and a coward hissed
ed

  josh refrained from answering and
turned to look out of the window port

  suddenly ed threw himself upon him
and snatched at his automatic the only
firearm in their possession which josh
had been guarding carefully they grap-
pled and both being etherially light and
unsteady of foot fell to the floor in the
struggle which ensued josh wrenched
the automatic from the others hand and
it fell like a feather to the floor out of
the reach of either

  weak though both were they battled
with frenzied energy each striving to
pick up the fallen weapon they were
about evenly matched for weight and
strength josh drove a hard right at ed
who dodged the blow which was absurdly
ineffective due to their lack of weight
causing the former however to slip to
one knee in a flash the other leaped for
the automatic but was tripped headlong
as josh entwined his arms football fash-
ion around the frenzied mans legs

  over and over the two men rolled
bouncing cursing and yelling striving for
mastery the none too fresh air made
them gasp for breath their struggle was
a tragi-comedy-farce ludicrous in the ex-
treme for at their distance from the
earth they were practically weightless
their weight being only about  as
much as at its surface they jumped and
bounced and floated about this way and

that locked in each others arms their
mightiest blows landing feather-like their
quickest motions ridiculously slow it
was like some silly dream without con-
trol or effectiveness in their ineffectual
struggles ed happened to bounce clear to
the other end of the cabin and josh re-
trieved the automatic

  ed rose slowly to his feet eyes blood-
shot features distorted with meanness
slowly he backed away and stood in the
comer of the cabin cowed into furious
submission by the levelled automatic in
the hands of his companion who was
facing him with set jaw and glinting eye

  stand still and dont move ed or
by heaven so long as you are determined
that one of us shall pass out-you will
be the one youre a dastardly coward
a treacherous hyena for shame i
thought you were a man

  ed cowered sullenly somewhat brought
to his senses oh all right have it
your way soon well see each other in
hell anyway

  yes i will have my way the least
we can do in our terrible circumstance is
to die like men not like wolves and
now let us understand each other at
the least sign of treachery on your part
again ill not hesitate but shall shoot to
kill

xtrom then on it became a strange
contest almost a curious form of
siege the two men kept a wary eye on
each other speaking but little coming
near only when it was time for josh to
pass out the scanty swallow or two of
water ed would gulp his portion then
greedily look on as josh slowly sipped
his own portion allowing the precious
liquid to trickle slowly drop by drop past
his swollen lips into his parched system

  the lack of sufficient food and water
was telling heavily their mouths and
throats were leathery and burning dry
to speak even was an effort faces were


amazing stories

gaunt and drawn bodies thin and weak
from hunger and thirst

  at times and with increasing fre-
quency josh himself felt that something
within him must snap often he caught
himself slipping into momentary lapses
of consciousness only to arouse himself
with a jerk

  for he could not trust the slowly gath-
ering insanity of the man before him
in their desperate plight the true charac-
ter of the other was showing itself-his
selfishness his greed and ruthlessness
one never knows what lurks in a man
until put to the test

  that ed king was determined to sur-
vive if possible at his expense josh now
knew only too well except when asleep
or in a stupor the half insane man
watched joshs every move never taking
his eyes off him although pretending to
appear disinterested full well josh knew
that even if he did agree by lot as to
who should remain alive with the last of
their water and air the other would not
abide by the draw

  as things stood their situation was ab-
solutely hopeless if only they had pro-
vided themselves with a slightly larger
supply of water and oxygen just a few
more days supply-foolish if-there
would have been strong hope for both of
them but now a horrible death for the
two was inescapable days ere their craft
crashed to the earth with no one alive
to control its downward plunge-unless
-unless one or the other   

  horrible thought he could not bear
it his fibre was not made of that stuff
countless of his forebears long since
gone and forgotten had died for their
comrades and for each other for their
country for a cause into his innermost
nature heroism had been burned on many
a battlefield he could not turn coward
now

  and yet life was sweet he was so
young he hated to die thus what had

he done to deserve such a horrible fate
all his hopes and ambitions all the won-
derful things he had planned to cto to
enjoy he looked down at his feet his
legs he studied his fingers his hands
felt of his chest his face-what precious
things they were and now he would
soon be forced to give up his body so
full of life and vibrant desire

ed sat sullenly on the opposite side
mumbling and cursing to himself
josh too was too weak to do more than
sit and hope-hope for what what
miracle could happen

  perhaps he was a fool perhaps   
he ought to save himself the only last
desperate thing to do had he not al-
ways heard it said that self-preservation
is the first law of nature assuredly the
other would not hesitate a moment if the
automatic were in his hand why not 
did not the other by his very act of
treachery forfeit his life-he himself
win the right to live was it wrong un-
der the circumstance-what would the
world have to say about it what would
anybody else do if he were in his place
or was he a fool to save his soul and
lose his life

  confusedly his tortured mind spun
round and round the treadmill of his
thoughts his soul bitter as gall his heart
full of rebellion at his terrible fate

  no he could not do it the instinct
of self-sacrifice and mutual aid developed
through the ages and which had made
man great setting him above the beasts
was very strong in him stronger than the
instincts of the tiger and the wolf he
would not purchase his life at the expense
of anothers he would die like a man

t t e was very weak and tired he
dared not allow himself the recup-
erative powers of undisturbed sleep in
that he was much worse oft than his
companion who perforce slept more than
shot into space



he josh had to snatch his sleep in fitful
dozes automatic always in hand weak-
ened senses on edge

  during his dozes he dreamed a great
deal always he was drinking great
drafts of cold water breathing deeply of
fresh air or feasting luxuriously he
dreamed he was at home through the
open windows looking out on their beau-
tiful garden delightful breezes blew
wafting to his nostrils the sweet smell of
green and growing things in front of
him piled high was a table full of food
the huge pile on his own plate seemingly
growing bigger as he gorged and gorged
his wife urging him to eat saying there
was plenty more and at his side was a
tall goblet of sparkling water which he
emptied continuously yet somehow never
seemed to have enough

  something made him open his eyes he
knew not what he had forgotten him-
self had fallen asleep over him loom-
ing huge and gigantic to his startled
senses stood king hand upraised clutch-
ing a large wrench ready to strike

  instinctively he ducked and received a
blow on the shoulder before his enemy
could deliver another blow he grappled
with him striving to pull his automatic
but the other was too quick for him and
prevented him from firing arms w-ound
around each other they began to enact
the same tragi-farcical dance ed strug-
gling to free his right arm which held the
wrench the other striving to employ his
firearm

  josh fought desperately with the fren-
zied half-mad king who kicked and
clawed and gouged and bit in their
struggles the automatic was discharged
a stream of bullets pierced the madmans
body

  josh tore himself loose his enemy lay
quite still he never regained conscious-
ness

  exhausted from the desperate struggle
for his life and weak from lack of nour-

ishment josh lay down and fell into a
long needed sleep

alone in his silent tomb a mo-
tionless figure the upper part of
his lifeless body and his face covered was
outside moving with the meteor poor
ed from the sunward side the fierce
rays of the sun illumined every nook and
cranny of the interior oddly enough it
seemed for the brilliantly star-studded
blackness of space showed against the
ports

  inside the air was close and fetid
although thanks to the radiant energy
of the sun comfortably warm he was
on his last reserve of compressed air
and oxygen

  two days since his swollen dry lips
had drained the very ultimate last drop
of water not a bit of food had passed
his mouth for over a week yet this he
did not mind so much but that dreadful
thirst sometimes he was tempted to
open the outer exit and let the inrushing
cold end it all in merciful instantane-
ousness

  two days yet ere the meteor would
reach the outermost molecules of the
earths atmosphere he must husband
his fast-ebbing strength felt he could
hold out if only the air would last that
long he knew that when his vessel be-
gan rushing through the outer confines of
the vacuous atmosphere he must have
sufficient strength to start the motors
must guide the craft safely to solid land
-must not allow too swift a rush through
the heavier layers of air to prevent burn-
ing up like a meteor his great velocity
must be retarded slowly gradually while
still scores of miles up

  he husbanded every ounce of his
strength lying perfectly still most of the
time to conserve the vitiated air now
and then he continued his observations
the meteor was now approaching the
earth on a fast in-running spiral the

huge body of the planet now filled more
than a quarter of the sky soon soon
the crucial process of landing would tax
his knowledge and skill

while still miles above the surface
he had started the engines-a su-
preme effort for his lone and wasted
strength but they were now going the
propellers spinning

  he made ready in plenty of time
the very sound and feel of the throb-
bing motors was like sweet music to his
ears a sweet caress to his tortured nerves

  not a drop of water for nearly four
days he was gasping for the air which
was now almost unbreathable any un-
looked for delay in landing would be
fatal

  summoning all his remaining reserve
of strength through sheer power of will
he stood tense at the controls under-
neath the surface of the earth loomed
welcomingly immense and wide bathed
in brilliant sunshine he could make out
no details even with his glass every-
thing was completely obscured by a vast
storm-area the outerside of the cloud
banks reflecting the dazzling rays of the
sun

  he was moving through the silence
with frightful speed any moment he
would begin to feel the retarding pres-
sure of the outposts of the planets
atmosphere he must be careful   
careful    descend lower slowly when
resistance against the body and wings
shall have reduced his terrific velocity to
within safe limits then proceed under
his own controlled power to a safe land-
ing place    life and happiness   

  at last he began to feel the cushioning
effect of the resisting atmosphere mov-
ing as he was at the residual enormous
velocity the wings of the meteor met
sufficient resistance even in the all but
empty space to control his rate of
descent as the friction against the body

the

 and wings gradually reduced his velocity
 he allowed the vessel to settle lower and
 lower

   slowly he settled still going at five
 thousand miles an hour-three thousand
 -two thousand - steadily decreasing
 lower and lower slower and slower the
 now cloudless vistas beneath drawing
 near thank god

   he was over land too weak and dizzy
 to care where anywhere so it was a
 safe place to land green fields trees
 roofs of houses the landscape melting
 and swimming before his eyes his knees
 sagged    ah a large open field he
 must land-land   

  a heavy thud as if in a dream he
felt the meteor bump along the ground
and come to rest    blessed land

   he felt himself going with his last
 remaining strength he reeled drunkenly
 to theexit with his last shred of will he
 unsealed the locks-shouts voices   
 funny things were getting dark  the
 floor rising toward him   

a strange face was bending over
him two faces-no several who
were these people what was he doing
in that bed 

  he heard murmuring voices funny-
he could not understand a word such odd
words he turned his head and looked
around white room white clothes-
where in the devil was he

   someone was holding his hand feeling
 his wrist a pleasant-faced man with a
 closely cropped beard was leaning over
 him talking with such senseless-sounding
 words in a strange language

   he closed his eyes inhaled deeply of
 the blessed air luxuriated in the sweet-
 smelling sheets he opened his eyes
 again the smiling face of a white-clad
 girl a glass tube at his lips-cooling
 water  he sucked greedily

   he was in holland after thirteen days
 and twenty-one hours in space

this contribution from an english author picturing the london of future
days and telling of robots has an application at the present time when
automobile accidents are so frequent we are always very glad to receive
stories from abroad it is so interesting to see how the science fiction
world is treated by those whom we conceive justly or unjustly to be the

more conservative english

slowly the bent old man
trudged along the broad avenue
which still bore the name of
the strand-that inadequate and
traffic-glutted thoroughfare of
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
but the rows of shops had long since
vanished and in their place one found
boulevard refreshment gardens and rest
rooms where charing cross station
used to rear its ugly head was now the
entrance to a park with streams and
shady walks and all the green pleasures
that nature could offer

  down the middle of the avenue tall
trees waved softly in the summer breeze
and here and there a bird chirped

 for london was changed gone were
the narrow roadways gone the noisome
food palaces where hundreds clamored
for their portion of preserved edibles
but most of all gone was the deafen-
ing roar of traffic of harshly applied
brakes and the occasional morbid crowd
betokening that some unfortunate had
been unsure of foot

  but the old man whom we will call
williams saw none of these things
each painful step brought him nearer
the end of his yearly pilgrimage for
each of the sixty years he had made
the journey ever since the first year

when the streets of the cities of the
world ran with blood

  at length he reached remembrance
square-some still connected it with
nelson and trafalgar-and paused to
survey the assembled throng many
thousand there must have been but
they seemed strangely silent and not a
few bowed their heads as though in
sorrow

  no longer surly lions guarded the em-
blem of the victor  instead a circular
pool rippled cool and inviting in the
middle of the pool was a tiny islet
and in the middle of the islet a single
tall pillar of green rising to a great
height overshadowing the buildings
for towering skyscrapers had long since
passed away and the sun of heaven
again illumined the earth

  close by stood a group of young
people excited yet hushed someone
whispered a minute to the hour and
williams turned his head they were
young they did not remember a tremor
shook his frame and he would have
stumbled but for the help of a stranger
who looked at him curiously

  it is all right he mumbled quite
all right thank you and the young
man smiled and rejoined his friends but

mad laugh of stewart and saw those
slender fingers hurl a hundred million
to perdition

  suddenly a curious silence fell upon
the multitude it lasted but a moment
then the air became filled with a clarion
burst as of bugles they beat into the
brain and woke wonder and fear and
slowly died away while the slender pillar
of green in the center of the islet pulsed
to a blood red

  silence-to the old man death itself
and yet it brought back memories more
vivid than life

	   

  while still at college bob williams
had met vera stewart and like most
others immediately fell in love with
her it seemed however that bob
was to be the lucky one

  soon she took him home and there
he met her father jason stewart even
then famous as an electric light engi-
neer it so happened that bob was spe-
cializing in light and electricity and
he found much of interest in stewarts
conversation

  as a matter of fact they became fast
friends over a protracted argument
just about that time there was a boom
in robot manufacturing and bob was
enthusiastic over what he was certain
promised to be the greatest era of mass
production there had always seemed
to be definite periods when production
along one particular line held the field
the first was that of the early auto-
mobile then of radio though he could
never really understand how people could
enjoy the voices of artists they could
not see others came afterwards-the
aeroplane the televisor the rocket car
but between each boom was a lull when
huge factories lay silent awaiting a
fresh advance of civilization

  now from every poster and every
sky-sign flared advertisements for ro-
bots secretaries kitchen maids porters

-a robot for every job and at a price
which every household could efford no
longer would the rich alone be able to
enjoy the infallible service of mechan-
ized brains huge factories were pour-
ing them out in thousands a day

  in short bob williams rejoiced in
the day of the cheap robot

  nonsense my boy remarked stew-
art merely a passing craze

 but bob was too young to bow to
superior knowledge and argued

  the robot or mechanical man is an
absurdity pronounced stewart if
you have a dish-washing machine oper-
ated by a handle do you buy a robot
to turn the handle of course not
you change your washer for an elec-
trically motored article

  the same thing applies everywhere
in the machine shops do they use robots
to operate hand screw machines no
they junk the screw machines and in-
stall automatics

 a robot as people know it is a
redundant device certainly it makes an
obsolete machine requiring manual ad-
justment free from that disadvantage
but that is just its fault and why it
cannot last when anything becomes
out of date it should be scrapped and
not given a new lease of life by another
invention redesign lad and dont try
to patch up

  but williams argued that a mechan-
ical servant could be set to do many
things while an automatic machine per-
formed only one function stewart
countered by pointing out that special-
ization was the greatest modern ten-
dency and so they went on for a
long time while vera fretted with the
televisor and doubtless promised herself
a fitting revenge still at the end they
became fast friends which ended in
bob gratefully accepting stewarts offer
of a position in his research workshops
when he had graduated


amazing stories

  the work was interesting and he
showed such promise that within a year
he became stewarts chief assistant be-
sides carrying out routine research for
several large corporations stewart was
always working on his own and derived
a steady income from several patents
on photoelectric relays which were his
especial forte

  bob found life increasingly good
during the day he was absorbed in his
work and in the evenings enjoyed the
company and friendship of vera nat-
urally their acquaintance had developed
and one evening after a jaunt to brit-
tany in stewarts rocket plane they
made the age-old vows

  vera besides keeping house for her
father a widower spent much of her
time in welfare work slums and such-
like sordid appendages of early civiliza-
tion having long since disappeared
leisured feminine society had to turn to
fresh fields of endeavor lately the
craze had been the providing of ambu-
lance depots and cars along the lesser
roads every day scores of accidents
occurred and often the injured re-
mained beneath the wreckage for hours
since the regular ambulance authorities
were far too busy with the troubles
of the highways to be able to tend the
wants of sportsmen who chose to roar
around country corners at eighty miles
an hour

  her father did not approve of this
side of her activities but as usual gave
in to her deands at dinner one eve-
ning he was expounding to bob his ideas
on the subject

  if fools treat the roads as racing
tracks they deserve to break their necks
for years engine performance and chas-
sis design has been improving speed
has crept up until a hundred miles an
hour along the mainways is considered
quite normal but the fools seem to
forget that although maximum speed

may increase to almost any figure the
limiting factors for safe driving are
braking distance and brain reaction
starting from the instant of danger
cars to-day can travel three times as
fast as they could in  but their
braking distance has remained the same
the best you can do with a wheeled
vehicle is to lock your wheels as a
matter of fact maximum braking effort
which means the relative coefficient of
friction between the wheels and the
road peaks just before actual locking
takes place

  bob nodded

  a case of dynamic and static fric-
tion he suggested

  exactly i cant think why the au-
thorities have taken no hand in the
matter which has been growing worse
and worse for the past decade speeds
have grown out of all proportion to
braking power and individual reaction
in the old days the average person
driving at forty miles an hour was able
to avoid accidents by quick application
of his brakes or a swerve at the wheel
now speed is quicker than thought and
so safety becomcs a matter of prob-
ability of course the roads are better
and automatic police signs help a lot
but accidents do not happen at cross
roads its only on the flats that auto-
mobiles show their astounding increase
in maximum velocity in fact catch-
ing at the word that is the cause of
all the casualties what used to be
a variable speed has degenerated into
straight line velocity because there is
no time to deviate

  vera is late this evening bob
essayed to change the subject into more
pleasant channels

 yes-stewart seemed to ponder-
she tells me her infernal club has
appointed her lady guardian of the
northern byways

  ah well laughed bob i expect
photo control



she wont be long for weve arranged
to slip over to the yarmouth coast to
watch the sunset

  but vera did not come home that
evening and it was late before the visa-
phone told the tragic tale she and two
of her friends had been tending the
injured at a corner ambulance-one of
the transportable type-when a huge car
driven apparently by a madman had
skidded at the curve and flung its two-
ton weight full at the little caravan
two girls had been killed immediately-
vera was one of them

  bob heard the fateful news from one
of the servants for jason stewart had
locked himself in his room it was
terrible sir the white-faced butler
stammered i thought master would
have gone mad he swore and stamped
about the room spoke about revenge
and then cried like a baby i darent
call him sir

  bob williams in those few words saw
his pleasant world spin into utter space
his mind seemed broken from its an-
chorage and for a moment he thought
of suicide but even the deepest sor-
row passes quickly in youth he flung
himself to work wrestled writh his prob-
lems till he was too tired even to think
and then often fell asleep at the lab-
oratory bench

  it must have been three weeks after
the terrible accident before he saw jason
stewart again he seemed to have
grow-n ten years older his face was
white and drawn with suffering but
his eyes shone curiously bright not a
word did he say to bob only patted him
on the shoulder

  not only did stewart appear to have
changed physically-his whole outlook
had been refocused he spoke little
but rob soon discovered that the nature
of their experiments was undergoing
a change stewart had grown greatly
interested in friction and especially its

application to synthetic rubber prepara-
tions literally hundreds of dynamom-
eter tests were carried out and curves
plotted but strive as they would the
very best adhesion they could obtain
gave results only seven or eight per cent
above the normal

  one day after many hours protracted
work jason stewart suddenly flung
down his slide-rule

  its no use he cried bitterly the
thing is impossible

  impossible bob stared it was so
unlike stewart to use such a word

  the maximum coefficient of friction
is unity and in practice it cannot of
course be attained i had thought by
suitable preparation of materials and
surfaces to cause extra adherence
through suction but no it is impos-
sible

  is that the problem sir asked bob
looking him straight in the eye

  jason stewart turned and stared out
of the window and then spoke in a
metallic voice

  i intend to make traffic safe the
first factor is that of more efficient
braking to obtain greater grip on
the road surface i must raise the co-
efficient of friction between the tires
and the road metalling under favor-
able conditions we have managed to do
so by a few per cent that is useless
for my purpose i must enable vehicles
to stop in one-tenth their present dis-
tance

  metal on metal has a coefficient of
about  leather on metal is about
 ordinary tires on road surface give
 we have raised it to  use-
less- his voice trailed off almost

in despair

  bob williams stared at him not
that the idea was new but because he
had never before heard stewart speak
in so unscientific a manner he had
touched only one factor of the problem


amazing stories

and despaired because he had been fore-
doomed to failure by a physical law
stewart was not good to argue with in
these days so it was with decided ner-
vousness that bob gave his opinion

  surely sir there are other aspects
of the problem 

  yes-tonelessly

  the adhesion between two surfaces
depends upon the coefficient of friction
between them and on the force with
which they are pressed together

  again stewart intoned metallically
it is approximately independent of
the contacting surface area and decreases
with an increase of speed its culminat-
ing maximum being the friction of re-
pose which theory i have elaborated
i am already aware of such things my
boy

  bob flushed but still pursued his ob-
jective

  so far we have worked only on
the actual coefficient what about the
other variable the pressure of the two
surfaces one against the other

  if you increase the weight of a
moving vehicle stated stewart you
increase the braking effect but at the
same time the inertia of the whole
moving body increases to a like degree
and one factor nullifies the other were
this not the case heavy automobiles
would have a much smaller braking dis-
tance than lighter ones as it is there
is practically no difference except what
is due to decrease in wheel bounce a
mere three or four per cent

  but to increase the pressure without
adding to the weight persisted bob

  a faint smile crossed the features of
stewart

  you would require a gravity at-
tractor i am afraid he replied and
so far this has resisted attack gravita-
tional force cannot be generated with-
out mass

  but the old-time electric rail cars

gripped the rails magnetically and could
stop in a very short distance couldnt
something after that style be brought

out

  rubber being practically nonmagnetic
it is out of the question even if we
built the roads of iron stewart smiled
sourly

  bob thought for a moment then

  if it were possible to add to the
weight of an automobile without in-
creasing its inertia that would solve
the problem he queried

  yes and stewart turned slowly
away

  all that night bob wrestled with the
question-to add weight without inertia
it seemed a paradox but at the back
of his mind he was sure there must be
a solution apart from the question of
a gravity attractor even that itself
was bound to be done some day but
all experiments up to that time had been
fruitless he racked his brains-weight
without inertia-almost as bad as mass
without weight

  eventually he rose from his bed and
slipping on a dressing gown strode out
to the veranda a fierce wind howled
around the building and caused him to
shiver strangely enough the sky was
clear and he stared mechanically at a
transatlantic helicopter majestically
sweeping along to the west wind
had no terrors for that monster of the
skies which held steadfast in the teeth
of the fiercest hurricane man had con-
quered the air but was defeated by prob-
lems of his natural medium the earth

  a fresh gust of wind caught him and
he was forced against the railings still
the helicopter held its way with its
score of giant vertical screws roaring in
defiance of course it was the screws
which held it steady-their gyroscopic
action steadied the craft after the style
once employed in ocean-going ships
photo control



suddenly bob gripped the railings hard
the gyroscope

  back in his room he worked feverishly
until he was called for breakfast then
ignoring the meal made haste to stew-
arts laboratory

  i believe ive got it sir he greeted
the engineer

  what

  weight without inertia was all
wrong

  stewart raised his brows

  we do not even want to increase the
actual weight of a body what we do
want is something some pivot to use
as a fulcrum for a lever to force down
the wheels the weight of the car
does not matter if we can get a rigid
pivot wait a minute sir he pleaded
im not mad the gyroscope will do
it

  stewart wheeled round

  the gyroscope his brows puck-
ered in thought then smoothed out
i wonder

  dont you see sir once you set
a heavy wheel spinning it strongly re-
sists a change in its plane of rotation
take a gyroscope big enough and fast
enough couple one side of its cradle
to the axle of a car and then as you
apply brakes increase the length of the
coupling arm by any sort of toggle
the gyroscope refuses to change its
plane and so the wheels are forced
down by the toggle lever and you get as
much friction as the tires will stand
stewarts eyes were blazing

  if dimensions worked out that cer-
tainly would do it lad

  yes but ive worked it out for an
average car sir waving a sheaf of
papers excitedly an -inch wheel
with a plane centroid at  inches radius
and weighing about  pounds would
be sufficiently rigid to squash flat the
tires of any ordinary car inflated to
 pounds per square inch oh the

speed i forgot that about 
revs per minute but thats easy using
mercury bearings besides it would
take hardly any power from the car

  stewart nodded

  well get to work on a design
immediately this is the first step

	   

  after several weeks work in which
elementary tests had shown the prac-
ticability of the idea their first full-
sized model was completed and ready
for trial an ordinary type of road
automobile had been adapted for the
purpose in the first place the idea
had been to place a gyroscope both at
the front and at the back so that both
sets of wheels would be affected ex-
periments had shown however that with
a relatively small gyroscope slung in the
middle of the chasis levers could be
arranged to transmit the pressure to
back and front alike

  the brakes themselves were of the
ordinary hydraulic type operated by a
single small foot brake much after
the style of the earlier automobile
both stewart and williams were fully
aware that this arrangement would have
to be modified before the design could
be put to commercial application but
it would serve for the time being

  from the main oil pressure cylinder
whence brake shoes took their feed an-
other pipe passed to an extra plunger
operating in another cylinder one
end of the latter was pivoted to the
cradle carrying the gyroscope while the
plunger itself was linked through tog-
gles to the front and rear axles which
had been modified for this purpose on
depressing the brake lever besides the
brakes acting in the ordinary manner
a terrific pressure was exerted on the
gyroscope tending to throw it angularly
from its plane of revolution due to
the persistence with which the gyroscope
retained its plane a high degree of


amazing stories

pressure was exerted through the tog-
gles upon the four wheels which there-
fore were driven down hard on the road

  the completed machine was wheeled
out of the workshops and stewart and
williams stood eyeing it speculatively
dynamic friction tests had been satis-
factory but both were curiously dubious
about its road performance

  dyou think id better phone over
for a test driver suggested bob

  stewart shook his head vigorously
certainly not the machine is all right
and i see no reason why we should not
make the tests ourselves come along

  with these words he took the drivers
place and bob clambered after him
as the magnetic clutch came into op-
eration and the car shot forward with
the customary violent acceleration bob
felt a sinking doubt about the advisa-
bility of stewart doing the driving
normally jason stewart was level-
headed and calm but now the very
devil seemed to have seized hold of
him and throwing caution to the
winds he swung round a turning and
headed for the great north main way
leading to the metropolis

  it was about  oclock in the morning
and the real traffic crush of the day
had not yet commenced nevertheless
they rarely had more than  or  feet
clear before them hundreds of cars
of all sizes and shapes roared their way
towards london

  speeds rather high this morning
remarked bob glancing at the meter
which hovered between  and  miles
an hour

  stewart made no answer but de-
pressing the throttle further passed
between two cars with a bare inch or
so to spare at the sides they had
proceeded in this dizzy manner for some
minutes when suddenly a metallic crash
smote their ears followed almost imme-

diately by the shrill scream of harshly
applied brakes

  a terrific force seemed to take hold
of bob and flung him forcibly against
the dash at the same time something
ripped away at the back flinging their
car broadside on

  bob struggled back to his seat and
found stewart nursing his wrists the
rear of their car had been crumpled
like so much matchboard by a huge
roadster behind

  what the devils happened bob
glared furiously at the other driver
who sat at the wheel a dazed ex-
pression on his face

  stewart gripped his arm excitedly
it works he ejaculated

  for the moment bob was completely
nonplussed

  what he demanded

  the brakes dont you see whats
happened i put em on immediately
the same as the rest of the drivers
when they heard the crash ahead we
stopped too quickly for the fellow be-
hind who has done us a bit of damage
still that doesnt matter the great
thing is the ideas all right

  but the driver behind had a different
opinion on the subject and it was some
considerable time before the usual for-
malities were concluded and once again
they maneuvered themselves into the
stream of traffic which between times
had grown to much greater dimensions
after the first misadventure stewart
was more careful but even so found it
very difficult not to pull up in too short
a space

  passing through london in this man-
ner they drew away to the south

  well take to some of the country
ways remarked stewart so that we
can carry out a few trials without fur-
ther mishap

  considering the fact that the weather
was delightful the country roads were
photo control



comparatively free of traffic they drove
along for some miles and were shooting
down hill at a good pace when stewart
jerked out quickly

  hold tight im going to brake

  bob clung on for all he was worth
which was not much again he felt that
unpleasant sensation as if someone had
butted him in the stomach and he and
stewart extricated themselves from the
front of the car

  not bad murmured stewart clam-
bering out from his pocket he drew
a large roll of tape and between them
they measured up the braking distance

  stewart had depressed the lever as
they passed a particular gate so that
there should be no doubt about the
stopping distance

  just over  feet he announced

  what was the speed asked bob

  exactly  and on a down gradient
of  in  but we must check this
again

  after entering up the particulars they
backed up the hill and made a similar
giddy descent this time being less for-
tunate in the result bob sustained a
severe cut on one arm where he was
thrown against the windshield and one
of the rear tires burst stewart how-
ever was delighted though he spoke
little as they slowly retraced their way
through london and back to the work-
shops

  as soon as they reached home me-
chanics were set on the job of stripping
down the wheels and brake mechanism
so as to determine how much wear
had taken place and whether anything
had been severely strained

  its no use relying too much on
theory ray lad said stewart catch-
ing bobs curious eye we have done
a lot in the last few years in bringing
design down to the standard of pure
mathematics but you can never be abso-
lutely certain of the factor of safety

the human element is far too great to
cut down strength to the very minimum
which after all is the object of true de-
sign

   bob nodded we shall have to make
a good many changes before we try out
that old bus again have you any
definite ideas

   yes we shall be able to lay down
a few principles and get smithson to
work on an entirely new model i am
afraid we shall have to re-design the
chassis we can probably make use of
the existing motors although their accel-
eration is far too low for our purposes
too low bob raised his eyebrows
why only the other day i thought you
were complaining that acceleration was
far away in advance of the rest of de-
sign

   yes it was rejoined stewart curtly
but lets go over the points in ques-
tion which our mishap this morning has
brought to our notice

   back in the office they talked the mat-
ter over at length and eventually bob
drafted out a series of proposals which
were to be passed to the chief designer
who was to commence work immediately
on a more elaborate model briefly
they were as follows

   	in the first place examination of
the tires and wheel rims showed straight
away that each time the gyroscope had
been applied the complete tire had been
flattened so that the rim itself bit on
to the metalled roads this was the
reason why a burst had occurred since
it was practically out of the question to
inflate tires to a higher pressure on the
score of comfort a new method was to
be tried by the side of each driving
wheel was put another wheel some three
inches smaller in diameter the tire made
of a solid ring of hard rubber under
normal conditions this was just clear
of the roads and played no part in ordi-
nary driving so soon as the brakes


amazing stories

were applied and the gyroscope toggles
drove the car down to the face of the road
these solid wheels served for braking
purposes by this means they hoped to
eliminate bursts and at the same time
enable even greater braking pressure to
be used if necessary

  stewart also postulated that they
would have to develop a material more
resistant to abrasion than the common
type of synthetic rubber but this would
not be difficult since their experiments
had previously extended rather fully
into this field

  	it was found that the brake shoes
themselves besides being badly worn had
in places fused beryllium long since
used as a material of construction in car
design would have to be replaced by
something capable of standing up to
higher temperatures again some meth-
or of cooling of the brake drums would
have to be adopted stewart proposed
to incorporate a small refrigerator such
as then used on racing cars

  the greatest problem of all was the
elimination of the human element of
braking together with its inevitable time
lag it was all very well to design and
develop super-efficient brakes but even
they would be of very little use in pre-
venting accidents if put under the con-
trol of any tom dick or harry who
had enough money to buy a car

  in the weeks that followed bob spent
most of his time in the workshops
supervising the construction of the new
machine with its strengthened brakes and
chassis members experiments on the
synthetic rubber had been entirely satis-
factory and they had decided on a ma-
terial composed of the usual elastic bond-
ing agent and floculated asbestos which
gave astonishing results on dynamometer
tests

  stewart had retired to his private lab-
oratory whence he issued only at meal
times he was hard at work on the

 other side of the problem but gave no
 indication of the direction which his en-
 deavors were taking

    bob felt rather irritated at this atti-
  tude for he could not help remembering
  that it was his own particular idea which
  had brought the gyrobrake into being

	what little spare time he had at his dis-
  posal he spent wondering how stewart
  proposed to rule out the trouble of
  brain reaction in fact he went to sev-
  eral demonstrations of the newly de-
  veloped robot chauffeurs which how-
  ever had not yet gained the sanction of
  the transport authorities what he saw
  at the demonstrations did not impress
  him very much for although the
  mechanical men seemed capable enough
  of controlling a vehicle under simple cir-
  cumstances it seemed very doubtful
  whether they would be able to show up
  well under the terrible traffic jam of the
  metropolis

   one day stewart appeared in the
 workshop with a whole sheaf of draw-
 ings under his arm and called bob to
 his side

    i think the problem is pretty well
 cleared my lad he said in a curiously
 tense voice

    bob was full of questions but stewart
  was unduly reticent

   well let smithson get busy with
 these drawings and incorporate them in
 the new model and see how it works

    with this bob had to be content days
  passed quickly and days into weeks and
  slowly the new machine grew

    at last came the day when it was com-
  pleted it resembled the ordinary road
  car except possibly its construction
  seemed a trifle sturdier and the wheels
  were of course novel to the front two
  curiously shaped headlamps were placed
  at the lateral extremities on a compli-
  cated swivelling arrangement bob noted
  further that these apparent lamps were
  twisted slightly inwards and instead of
photo control



pointing towards the ground were di-
rected straight out

  he was examining the foreign parts
of the car when stewart came along

  youre due for a little explanation

i	think

  well to tell you the truth i had be-
gun to wonder when you were going to
tell me

  stewart patted his shoulder im
sorry my lad but i have been very busy
and very worried but thats past now
lets have a look at the bus

  whats the idea of these head
lamps asked bob

  theyre not headlamps of course
rejoined the other actually they are
carefully prepared and focussed tele-
lenses at the back of each of which is
situated one of the new ribidium photo-
electric cells but perhaps id better
start at the beginning

  bob nodded

  well its like this proceeded stew-
art from the first it was clear that
it was out of the question to leave the
direction of a car fitted with these new
brakes to the varying abilities and re-
actions of a human driver the ques-
tion was then to replace personal control
by something mechanical or to be more
corrcct electrical since this is somewhat
outside the sphere of mechanics a little
consideration of the question showed
that each car when driven at a particular
speed required a zone of safety in
front of it extending just over the width
of the car and to a distance slightly
greater than the stopping distance at the
speed at which the car was driven at that
particular moment by some means or
other this speed zone had to be main-
tained you see with your gyroscope we
can pull up a car driven at  miles
an hour in say  feet good enough
but the time taken in braking and bring-
ing the car to a standstill is very much
less than the actual time taken for the

driver to see the source of danger trans-
mit this to his brain and from the brain
to the various nerves and muscles down
to his toe on the pedal good braking
alone would only make the whole ques-
tion of driving control more dangerous
much after the style that acceleration has
worked havoc in the past years his
eyes shone brightly but im getting
away from the subjcct you know of
course how we are able to judge dis-
tance 

 i suppose because we have two
eyes suggested bob

  exactly our eyes are set apart and
so when we look at an object they point
inwards and the subtended angles gives
us immediate indication of the distance
that the object is away not exactly
of course but at least to a degree on
my arrangement i duplicate these con-
ditions by what you refer to as head-
lamps these are always trained ahead
of the car and inwards to an extent de-
pending on the speed actually their
mountings are coupled indirectly to the
road wheels so that the faster the wheels
rotate the lesser is the angle subtended
between the two sets of lenses in
other words the faster the car goes the
further away is the point of intersection
of the two beams this distance is on
this particular model four feet greater
than the minimum braking distance at
the particular speed

  immediately we are afforded a means
of noting whether the distance between
the front of our car and the rear of the
vehicle in front of us is safe i had
thought in the first place to build an ap-
paratus after this style giving an audible
or visible indication but after all it
would have been practically useless for
the brain-lag would come into the ques-
tion again when the brakes had to be
applied immediately

  as the thing stands now photo-elec-
tric cells are placed behind the lenses


amazing stories

and as soon as any body falls within
the zone of safety the photo-cells are
affected and operating on a relay apply
the brakes to the full

  bob thought for a moment it seems
a very good stunt he admitted at last
but does it take into consideration the
speed of any object what i mean to
say is-supposing you arc driving to-
wards a building i can see then that
your trained photo-cells snap on the
brakes and prevent you crashing but
supposing instead of its being a building
it was another car coming in the opposite
direction at a speed about the same as
yours you might pull up in time but
what about the other fellow

  oh of course he laughed uncom-
fortably i forgot that all the cars
would be fitted in this manner still
he went on im not sure that i see it
yet

  steady steady youre quite right
stewart assured him but id thought of
this already when i said that the
photo-cells operated as soon as any ob-
ject was brought within their field i was
only stating the action roughly as a
matter of fact although they do operate
in that manner they are also sensitive to
infra-red beams which you have proba-
bly guessed are used through the lenses
i see bob nodded that seems all
right i suppose it works though

  of course it works or will work
stewart was rather tart there are one
or two points that i have not mentioned
for instance rounding corners i sup-
pose you have noticed that the car has
no steering wheel

 no

  this has been replaced by a simple
right and left key switch when the
driver wishes to take a turn to the
right he throws over the switch just be-
fore coming to the turn immediately
the photo-visor lamps swing to the right
their angular speed being dependent on

die speed of the car at the time this
is adjusted so that road grip under worst
conditions is sufficient to counteract the
inevitable centrifugal action of the mass
of the car later on we can probably
arrange that wheel pressure is increased
while taking turns so as to permit faster
and safer cornering

  again-stewart continued but no
a demonstration will be better than all
this talk however i can tell you
straight away that all factors of road
conditions have been taken into consid-
eration you can visualize the action of
the safety zone quite easily besides
being connected with the brakes it also
acts on the accelerator so you can im-
agine the traffic of the main roads and
the city itself speeds raised even high-
er than they are to-day-all cars
mechanically controlled by their photo-
zones as soon as any object or any
other car or a pedestrian gets within
the zone so soon do the brakes come on
as soon as the object is removed the car
accelerates to its maximum if the ob-
ject does not move the zone swerves first
to the left and then to the right seek-
ing out its own path at corners the
driver flips his switch and the zone
swings round accordingly seeking a safe
path as it rounds a comer the gyro-
pressure is applied automatically depend-
ing on the speed this particular piece
of apparatus will be fairly easy to de-
vise and we shall probably profit by ex-
perimenting on the mercury pendulum
cant you see them stewarts voice
rose hundreds of cars thousands of
cars mechanically controlled driven down
the main roads and through the cities all
the cities of the world driven at break-
neck speed    miles an hour
all mechanically controlled no danger
no accidents mechanical perfection every-
where the human factor entirely elim-
inated no cries of the broken and
crushed no ambulances absolute
photo control



safety with maximum speed the traffic
problem smashed at last my god if
only we had done this before-before
  his voice trailed off

  abruptly he turned away and bob was
left staring after him

    

  bob williams stood alone in the
temporary tele-visor studio at transport
house curiously he inspected the ap-
paratus much of it was known to him
but this branch of science had progressed
at such a pace that it needed a special-
ist eye to comprehend the functioning of
each detail he moved towards the
great windows and stared down the
strand with its turmoil of traffic

  it was a great day for the world per-
haps the greatest day for a hundred
years at  oclock that morning traffic
all over the world was to be synchro-
nized as the news bulletins called it
synchronize d-brought into time
brought into step with the times

  bob stared again at the traffic a tur-
moil truly but an ordered turmoil not
the bustling blundering of human hands
but the steady infallible rush of me-
chanised science each of those thou-
sand vehicles below him were travelling
at high speed but none crashed none
were in danger of crashing violent
braking violent acceleration sudden
swerve spin round a corner stopping
starting all were carried out with utter
precision and there were no accidents

  london had been like that for nearly
a year as had new york paris berlin
and the other great cities of the world
but on that day the safety zone and the
gyrobrakes were to be made compulsory
for every vehicle on the face of the
earth heavy penalties brought to the
equivalent of attempted manslaughter
were to be applied to any one found
driving manually-controlled machines
not that anyone would have dared it

was impossible in that tear of traffic for
an humble brain to respond quickly
enough to avoid almost instant anhi-
hilation

  the three years which had passed
since their first test had gone quickly
bob felt older indeed looked older but
the time had gone in a flash

  stewart too had aged now at his
day of triumph it seemed that the fires
of life were almost spent he had
grown thin emaciated but with a de-
clining physical strength his eye had
grown brighter his brain more alert than
ever albeit there had been strange
lapses he had grown fond of his own
company sometimes he would shut
himself in his room for days and see
no one something was wrong with
jason stewart bob felt it was sure of
it but he could do nothing for a curious
sort of barrier had grown between them
they were still friendly the best of
friends ever but still the barrier was
there

  bob was afraid that the loss of his
daughter was still preying on stewarts
mind a lump rose in his throat as he
thought of the girl who might have been
his wife

  this day shall be consecrated to her
memory the world shall ring with
her name they shall remember ah
they will remember  

  curious words these but stranger still
coming from the lips of jason stewart

  an official entered the room an en-
quired whether mr stewart had arrived

  no bob shook his head he said
he would probably be late he has
much work on his hands as you are
probably aware

  yes sir but he will be here half-
an-hour before the time you see he
went on it is not very often that a
world tele-broadcast is carried out apart
from the main studios and it requires a
little adjustment beforehand although


amazing stories

we have made tests for the past week or
so most of them have been satisfac-
tory but they have had some trouble
over in china due to the recedence of
the heavy side layer around that quar-
ter

  bob nodded he was not greatly in-
terested in china or the heavyside layer
like jason stewart he too was think-
ing of vera

  the official came closer i suppose
sir he said mr stewart will be using
his apparatus to-day

  apparatus what apparatus

  oh i thought you knew sir in the
next room mr stewart has been ex-
perimenting for a month or so on some
new idea he mentioned once that he
would probably be using it to-day
bob shook his head im afraid i
dont know anything about that i
havent seen mr stewart much lately
a quarter of an hour later stewart
entered he shook hands with bob
nervously and avoided his gaze without
a word he made to a side door unlocked
it and disappeared within the whine
of generators broke through the silence
of the room rose in pitch and disap-
peared as it passed the limit of audible
frequency ten minutes twenty min-
utes passed and the crystal indicator
showed five minutes to the hour a
door opened and stewart reappeared his
face flushed and of staring eye

  five minutes in five minutes i shall
speak to the world in five minutes i
shall tell them the story of vera all
the world will know his lips twitched
all the world will know ah and
theyll never forget his voice rose to
a scream

  steady sir steady bob did not
like the look of things there was some-
thing about the old man which made
him think that proud reason was al-
ready tottering on its throne the ef-
fort and endeavor of the past three years

combined with his brooding sorrow had
been too much

 two minutes to go one minute
the silence indicator snapped into a red
glow the televisor was working

  jason stewart scrambled up to the
instrument and stared at the all-seeing
eye ten million people were watching
him were listening to the wheezy gasp
from his lips the second indicator
clicked and stewart cleared his throat

  peoples of the world to-day at this
very minute traffic is synchronized you
know what it means you know what
it can do therefore i will not elabo-
rate instead i wish to tell you a story
his voice shook a little three years
ago i had a daughter as many of you
have daughters she was all i had
she was killed killed by some sportsman
driver while she was tending the injured
at the wayside she was killed by
traffic-man-driven traffic

  since then i have worked i and the
lad who might have been my son we
have worked together day and night
to make traffic safe at this instant a
million new cars are on the road con-
trolled not with the clumsy murderous
hand of man but by the infallible power
of science-of mathematics they are
safe your daughters are safe my god
  stewart paused for breath

  williams standing just aside thought
he would have fallen

  take it easy sir he suggested in a
whisper

  stewart glanced at him and made
some adjustment on the table what
was he doing

  bob williams stared a switch a
small simple black switch in bakelite
probably only a bell or some signal

  mechanically williams eye followed
the switch down and saw a long trailing
wire passing along the side of the room
it was simple enough it must be some
sort of indicator
photo control



  stewart went on pardon me peoples
of the world but i am an old man to-
day i feel it more than ever sudden-
ly he laughed if i had a daughter i
might feel better peoples of the world
but you and your traffic took her away
from me look what i have given you
in return safety for yourselves safety
for your daughters dyou think im
a fool yes an old fool he grew
rigid the safety of your traffic de-
pends on my photo-zones the wave
length of the infra-red beams in 
microns you will not understand it
you only care for maddening speed for
traffic for mad traffic for murderous
traffic in your hearts you dont care
whether it is safe or not safe listen
in ten seconds i shall blot out the safety
zones all over the world you can hear
me but you have no time to act in ten
seconds i cut off those safety zones
you shall remember my daughter the
traffic of the world has ten seconds to
live

  suddenly truth burst upon bob wil-
liams and he flung himself at the old
man but the strength of a maniac stew-
art thrust him away they closed

again williams seized him round the
arms but stewarts first caught him in
the throat and he crashed to the floor
striking his head before uncon-
sciousness claimed him he saw stewart
deliberately depress the little switch and
almost simultaneously a roar burst from
the strand below

  driven at a dizzy speed all the photo
controlled cars were suddenly deprived
of their guiding power in the fraction
of a second where all had been order
was confusion chaos death the streets
of london new york the cities of all
the world were in that moment converted
into a shambles literally the pave-
ments ran with blood

  in that moment jason stewart had
revenge



  once again sounded the bugles and
the crimson pillar in remembrance
square faded gradually to a peaceful
green the multitude stirred uneasily
lingered a few minutes longer and then
stragged away in awkward groups to
their homes or occupations only the
old man remained behind on this his last
pilgrimage

    in this department we shall discuss every month topics of interest ta reader the editor invite correspondence on all
    subject directly or indirectly related to the itorles appearlno la this magaaln io case a special personal answer i
    required a nominal tee at  to cover time and postage is required

common sense vs optimism-a letter of
excellent criticism

editor amazing stories 

  tlianks for squashing mr rawson whose
letter appeared in the may issue of amazing
stories his remarks about poe wells etc
made me indignant and it did me good to see
your opinion was the same as mine although
the so eloquent mr rawson may have already
read what he terms a waste of valuable space
myself and all the newer readers have not as
a s is becoming more popular every month
it is probable that the majority of the present
readers have not read those old stories if
many letters like the one i have mentioned come
in with its talk of nightmares and phony ex-
cuses you certainly have a lot to put up with

  i stall sympathize with you once more then
start criticizing your magazine it really is too
bad that you cannot express your thoughts about
space-flying without being so severely criti-
cized my common sense agrees with you about
such stories as triplanetary but my opti-
mism is up in arms

  the cover on the may issue is however
much better than any yet so much better that
i scarcely recognized the magazine the pres-
ent size is convenient and makes the magazine
easier to hold while reading i might sug-
gest smooth edges to the pages after all
what does the format matter anyway

  having defended the reprints i should praise
them the diamond lens was fine and so
was the story i forgot wthat the title was of
the clockmaker that thought he could create
life much better i liked seeing the gold
bug in our magazine although i had read it
before it was like meeting an old friend con-
tinue the reprints they rest ones mind after
the stress and strain of ultra-space sub-ether
inertia-less matter green emanation red heat-
rays blue disintegration rays-and pink ele-
phants at one time i liked interplanetary stories
but now there is so little story and so much
ray wave new kinds of ether and vile forms
of life that they all leave the same impression
confusion terror out of space started out
fine but in the end it deteriorated until it fol-
lowed the same old formula as all the others
by this time the indignant reader will have
gathered that i did not particularly like tri-
planetary or when the universe shrank
in spite of my aversion to waves and rays i
liked the ultra-gamina wave because it had
only one wave and the reader did not get
mixed up

  i thoioughly enjoyed the lost city but
it was a shameful trick of the authors to break
off just when things began to happen talk-
ing of breaking off the piece pulled out of the
middle of dr grimshaws sanitarium pre-
vented an excellent story from becoming well-
nigh perfect in spite of the preponderance of
those old spoilers ultra super sub wave and
ray the jameson stories have me cheering for
them even if they have their faults they are
so unusual and interesting in plot that they sim-
ply refuse to be ruined the lost language
was a wonderful story mr wolheims letter
on the subject was also interesting the
regenerative wonder and the death proto-
zoan were two very good stories i think that
the time travelling idea is getting somewhat out-
worn unless it is used simply as the instrument
for telling a more interesting narration this
was done in the mentanicals and in times
mausoleum to a certain extent the theft of
the washington monument and the time
jumpers were just undiluted time-travelling
and as a result were not nearly as good as the
first two there was one humorous time-travel-
ling story that i believe was called the
island that i found very interesting and
amusing why not get the author to write a
sequel to it the supermen might have been
fairly good when the author first got the idea
but he completely ruined it for me by writing it
in diary form two other stories that were
outstandingly well written and interesting
were cats eye and peril among the driv-
ers readers interested in the latter story
might find the hook insect behaviour by
cheeseman excellent reading

  i have just one more suggestion to offer i
know that you must be tired of suggestions but
how are you to know what we readers want
and dont want unless we tell you amazing
stories could be made more interesting to
people who can only get it occasionally if only
one serial were given each month and the rest
of the fiction space were devoted to short
stories in this way there would be more
variety in each copy of a s well i have
gassed long enough so  close with a re-
quest for letters to me from any readers of that

letter as the present one indicates throughout
careful thought and a refreshing optimism
the two reprints which you mention the latter
one by jules verne deserve all the praise you
give them we could not pretend to say how
many times your editor has read the gold
bug it was as fresh as ever when we were pre-
paring it for the magazine in first class work
there is an indefinable something that makes it
possible for one to read it over and over
again one of the highest class magazines of
the day has from its inception been quite de-
voted to reprints of old favorites we do not
ask authors to write sequels because our pres-
ent stock of stories awaiting publication is not
sufficiently depleted-editor

reprints of verne and poe objected to-
a tribute to the lost city-a good
word for morey

editor amazing stories 

  this letter is my small contribution to the
reprint controversy old stories are okay as a
rule i say as a rule because of my antago-
nist for those verne and poe classics which
every so often appear between your covers can-
not the editor see that neither verne nor poe
are wanted they are good-but out-of-date
what we reprint advocates wants are rare old
tales such as the blind spot and not stories
which are known and studied by children at
school practically every book shelf contains
poes works and verne while not so popu-
lar is still encountered at every turn so i beg
of you please cease such useless reprinting and
devote the valuable space thus wasted to worth-
while masterpieces

  but to more congenial subjects the june
amazing all considered was a good issue
milton r peril furnished many thrills and gave
us much science in the lost city thats
what i like about science fiction-it gives dry
abstract science a different twist which makes
it easy to understand its remarkably like tak-
ing sugar-coated medicine

there is a point in publishing poes stories
at the present time the one hundred and
twenty-fifth anniversary of his birthday has
been recently celebrated and this makes his
stories very timely they are so very good
that they will stand several readings you
speak of every book shelf containing the works
of jules verne one of our correspondents
says that he cannot get them that he thinks
jules vernes works are out of print your
comparison is a little hard on natural science
if we only get deep enough into it our knowl-
edge and understanding of it will be the best
sugar-coating but dont call natural science

  just a line to let you know that i received
the february and march issue of amazing
stories on the th of april also i wish to
congratulate you on the new publication of the
may issue the frontispiece portraying jules
vernes immortality is certainly a masterpiece

  the stories seem quite different from what
they used to be a few years ago but however
one must be content and take life as it comes
i shall not comment on any of the stories as
if one has a mind and uses it in a manner one
can learn and know how to like all stories that
are published in your amazing stories maga-
zine	-

  i like to read and re-read your magazine
over and over again then one seems to live
with the story actually to be part of it to be-
come engrossed in it is my ideal the metal
doom of two years ago was a story that all
nations should have read as it may sound like
fiction but one day it will be an actual happen-
ing yes-the metal doom is possible and
the after effect would make people realize that
life is really worth living and to take everything
as it comes whether good or bad and to be con-
tent with little as what shall it profit a man if
he should gain the whole world and lose his
own soul some day ill write an article for

looking at amazing stories again for the re-
mainder of his life-editor

a delightful and well-put letter from
ao eleven-year-old girl

editor amazing stories

 congratulations on the may issue  the
stories from cover to cover were wonderful 

  maybe i shouldnt speak out that way being
only eleven years old and a girl at that but
i couldnt restrain a prolonged shout of joy be-
ginning with the blue and cream cover which
was swell and lasting to the very advertise-
ments

 the story dr grimshaws sanitarium
was the cream of the crop but the cream was
not confined to one story the lost city
was all i could wish for hope it keeps up as
good the white dwarf ultra-gamma
wave-in short a perfect issue as far as im
concerned to more scientific-minded people
who are always looking for flaws it may not
have been

  i have a word for the kickers which seem
to be so profuse in the discussions columns
you kickers never try to better the issue you
yell about this and that but do we hear any
helpful comments i mean really helpful ones
nol you that want the edges cut even do
you ever stop to think that you have a perfectly
good pair of scissors which might be put to
useful purpose im afraid i use too much
authority-but-they give me a pain in that
part of the body which connects the head with
the rest

  heres hoping i can see my name in print
the next time dad buys a swell all around
magazine he never misses an issue

  this letter gives us special pleasure as it
is the composition of a girl eleven years old
which is a charming period in the life of that
interesting being whom we term woman the
work of the editor of such a magazine as ours
is extremely interesting but we could let it
attack the editorial nerves if we took the
kickers you speak of too seriously a little
appreciation is most welcome especially when
it comes from such as you are we mean in age
and sex it is quite a triumph to have both old
and young in the one family appreciate amaz-

notes on the old and new format of
amazinc stories-a plea for well-known
authors

editor amazing stories 

  well here i am again i dont mean to use
up so much space in your discussions but i
have some criticisms and questions to offer
first i much prefer the old type of covers

although your new covers are improving i
also like the old print and type

  i saw in another magazine a discussion on
the color of space one person maintained that
it was black but another said that it was dark
purple can you tell us which is correct

  lately there have been articles in various
magazines and papers about the new telescope
which is being constructed for the california
institute of technology the mirror will be
 inches in diameter how large would a
body need to be if it was absolutely black or
nearly so to be seen on the moon with this
new telescope

  if anyone would like to correspond with me
by mail on science and science-fiction i will be
glad to discuss anything which i can by letter

  mr editor i have a terrible statement to
make since i started reading amazing
stories in  i think that science-fiction in
general is getting worse not amazing
stories in particular i think that amazing
stories is still the best magazine published
but some others are getting worse each month
if it werent for the few veteran authors who
contribute stories it would be a low grade
science-fiction magazine but i hope that they
will cease having new and amateur authors that
dont compare with the veterans of course if
a new authors stories are good then i approve
of printing them let us hope that this slump
in the value of s f stories will soon be over
ditto the depression

  well now that i have stopped slinging brick-
bats i will say that good old  years
amazing stories tops them all keep up the
good work

  we cannot predict what will be the smallest
object that the great telescope with its -inch
mirror will show science-fiction should not
run down because science proper is always
developing something new while topics of the
authors of purely fictional stories would seem
to have been exhausted years ago space is
black we thank you for your concluding sen-
tence-editor

interesting remarks on serial stories-
jules vernes stories-our best authors
considered

editor amazing stories 

  its rather hard for me to make up my mind
whether i like the new format of the maga-
zine or not it was rather a blow to me when
i first saw the reduced size i always liked the
receding title and too the larger magazine
seemed to possess more wordage however
when i think of the fact that so far the covers
have been  perfect in contrast to many of
the older magazine covers and the magazine
itself much better bound i think the new format
is almost as good particularly i like the idea
august

of more than ore serial in a magazine a story
written up to book length always seems to me
to be better written than the short story possi-
bly because there is always the chance that a
long story will be made into a book while the
short story lives only a short while conse-
quently the author spends more time and art on
the longer one now i see that you have three
serials and with me that registers o k i
thought i had either read or knew the titles
of all of vernes fantastics but measuring a
meridian is one i never heard of its good
i wonder if you couldnt reprint hector ser-
vadac or the chase of the golden meteor
one of the readers stated that it was probably
his best work in that line contrary to many
opinions it is practically impossible to secure
any of vernes work i believe they are out of
print

  for many years i had pronounced the name
jules verne the way it was spelt but then i
discovered jules was pronounced jool perhaps
many of your readers have been fooled similarly
and while on the subject of pronunciation i
have been pronouncing martian the way it is
spelt but on reflection discovered that it prob-
ably is pronounced marshian am i right in
both these counts whether right or wrong i
will have a hard time breaking my habit of
mis-pronouncing in both cases

  your best author and i am in accordance
with most of your readers is dr edward elmer
smith triplanetary was fine but some-
how did not hit the level set by spacehounds
it is strange about dr smith no no dont
print his picture  may be disappointed it is
rather terrible the way you treat dr keller
with only three stories in a year of the bunch
he is the only real literateur it is doubly
strange you do not print more of his stories as
i have a fancy that amazing stories editorial
chair also favors keller above the others is it
true stories of his have been translated into
foreign languages

  many years ago dr breuer author of an-
other story that should have had more ap-
plause than it got namely paradise and iron
wrote a letter to discussions mentioning a scrap-
book of outstanding stories culled from amaz-
ing stories wouldnt it be a good idea to let
him name them for our perusal he also puts
the literary touch to some of his stories in
fact i used to class keller and breuer together
think it over breuer is a good judge of
stories sometimes you disappoint me in
past years you have continually remarked on
the fact that you were over supplied with too
many good stories to even consider reprints
then in addition to giving us a host of many
very poor stories you had to follow it up with
reprints of edgar allan poe i can get them
without exception at the public library be-
sides reprinting stories with a literary taste
to them will not bring our magazine anywhere
near the atlantic monthly as you half jokingly

remarked in discussions what youve got to
do is to print unpublished stories that will rival
poes whats more sometimes youve done it-
witness no more tomorrows omega the
man the mentanicals and even dr
grimshaws sanitarium which i liked very well
-perhaps i shouldnt have mentioned this last
as it doesnt quite leave the land of harum-
scarum for the land of that indefinable some-
thing

  in spite of all my criticisms im with you to
the end with the advent of three serials and
a good story like terror out of space my
enthusiasm is running almost on the top line of
our enthusiasm chart only at infrequent but
sudden intervals sagging all the way to the zero
line only to pop right up again get more
from e e smith right away get keller
busy make stephen hale author of the
laughing death and worlds adrift a staff
writer keep three serials get more charles
tanner-am waiting impatiently for his serial
with forest ackerman-keep discussions up-
to-date

  we really thank you for liking the covers
we can assure you that a great deal of thought
is expended on them and the artist has even-
motive to make them good with a view to his
progress in art in the future serials are a
bone of contention some like them and some
do not but we really think that you put the
thing about right in taking the ground that
the long story is apt to be a more solid piece
of literature than the short one the second
pronunciations which you give are correct we
will not attempt to describe anybodys cast of
countenance so we will leave dr smith to your
imagination as you may imagine he is quite
an impressive looking personality we have
many real literateurs we are giving now one
of dr kellers best stories which puts him
high in that class we are rather amused a
your wanting three serials when a number of
our correspondents object to any-edttob

a letter about reprints

editor amazing stories

  i am writing to let you know my ideas upon
the subject of reprints

  during the last few months you have been
giving us reprints mainly of poes works
now as you remember one of your chief ar-
guments against reprints was that they were
obtainable in public libraries this is incor-
rect at least so far as the section in which i
live is concerned i have never found any science
fiction except one or two stories by veme but
of all the science fiction that you could reprint
poes are the only ones which are present in
practically every library and also i do not
consider poes tales although they are very
fine as science fiction

  you are now running a serial by jules verne
this is all right and i believe i will enjoy
reading it but i think that in publishing it
you are more or less evading the issue i do
not think the reprints you are giving us are
the ones that are wanted by those who de-
sired this class of stories in my opinion they
wanted stories like treasures of tantalus
the skylark of space station x etc i
could list many more but these are representa-
tive of the type i think your readers want

  if you ever read poes story called three
wednesdays in a week you would find it a
model of a science fiction story with a definitely
humorous touch in poes inimitable manner
the story entitled measuring a meridian is
one which will stand very careful reading
however we will have to let the subject of
reprints go for the present we have some
very good stories awaiting publication which
are not reprints-editor

the jules verne monument cover-reprints
not favored-a letter from a lady

editor amazing stories

  although i have been a constant reader of
amazing stories for years in fact since its
inception i have never written in before i
am writing now mainly for two reasons

  first let me congratulate you on your may
cover-it is absolutely the best looking cover
ive ever seen on any sf magazine and should
be the answer to every science fiction readers
prayers why not print some with no printing
on to be framed-ill buy one

   second i want to register my protest against
reprints and such reprints as poe and verne
any one at all interested in sf has probably
read them i know i read them years ago
and if i felt like reading them again all i
would have to do is walk a couple of blocks to
the nearest public library if you must have
reprints why not some that arent so well
known otherwise i have no complaints to
make i enjoy the magazine as a whole very
much

  thanking you for many hours of pleasant
recreation

  this correspondent says i have never
written in before as she is a lady that alone
is a good reason from our standpoint that she
should write again we want letters from her
charming and highly interesting sex as far
as we have ascertained vernes story measur-
ing a meridian which would tempt any editor
of a science fiction magazine on account of its
information about the measurement has been
read by very few of our readers we have
had one letter which you will probably see

where the writer says he cannot get any of
jules vernes books we will repeat in closing
that we hope to hear from you again-editor

riding the editor-he wishes more would
do it if they do as well as this
correspondent does

editor amazing stories

  jules vernes monument looks good on the
cover thanks to moreys masterful touch

  i like the way you are making up the con-
tents page now

  terror out of space ends good and the
new serial starts out good winstead md

f	pratt and j lewis burtt have good con-
tributions in this issue too why are you
putting two serials in now i think one is
enough

  i seem to have gotten the editor into no
little bit of trouble over his answer to a ques-
tion of mine regarding the possibility of a trip
to the moon but the editor should be quite
immune to all kinds of brickbatz and slams by
this time anyway im glad we all dont feel
the way he does about it its too bad we cant
live long enough to find hes been wrong
anyway the editor has a nice editorial in this
number maybe he will forgive me for riding
him after this compliment

                           stout street
                            denver colorado

  many people think that two serials are cor-
rect some even like three the editor as you
suggest is somewhat immune to attack but not
perfectly so and when attacked it is a great
pleasure to be able to confute the attacker as
he has done this very day out of websters
unabridged we also fail to see anything per-
sonal or offensive in conflicting views about
trips to the moon-editor

a letter of excellent criticism from a
careful reader

editor amazing stories

  would like to enter this letter in discus-
sions if ye would be so kind i will admit i
have a knock or two to thrust down thine
honorable throat

  it seems passing strange to me that an editor
should be so persistently against the thought
of interplanetary travel especially in the light
of past and present discovery i wonder if it
could be professional jealousy of some sort
i have noticed that in a great many cases
learned men have denounced strenuously the
strange and new as false and impossible why
is this trait so pronounced in mankind let
us hear from the editor and see what he has to
say david h keller should have a chance at
this as a psychologist to express his opinion
on the subject of doubt

the story the terror out of space in
one way could be considered excellent but in
another very dull it is good as far as charac-
august 

amazing stories



ter portrayal is concerned but the story is weak
when it comes to giving the readers something
new

  the lost city is fair but the author must
have a sadistic mind at one point anyway when
he remarks on the humor of cheops maybe
there were a couple of cheops and im thinking
of another if it was the one that built the
great pyramid in egypt then his humor was
very touching  on a lot of people if you
understand what i mean ill let it pass with-
out any further remarks hope peril doesnt
feel hurt

  cut down on the number of serials to two at
the most in one issue if there are a lot of
them cn hand why not print them in a quar-
terly you could get rid of eight short novels
in a year in this manner two in each quarterly
the monthly could handle about seven others
during a year fifteen in all

 would like to hear from anyone who is
inclined to write and if anyone is interested
in finding out interesting things about authors
drop me a line and ill see what i can do

  if by this time the editor feels i have let
him down i will say i have a complete file of
all amazing stories since the first and am
looking forward to the tenth birthday of this
patriarch of science fiction with no little
anticipation

                         second street
                            pittsfield mass

  you need not be afraid of knocking an
editor that poor individual spends his life
in an atmosphere of knocks you speak of
something seeming passing strange to you
mans efforts to rise from the surface of the
earth become very messy when he reaches ten
miles of elevation and the moon is in round
numbers twenty-four hundred times as far
away as this such figures as this should take
out any element of personality which curiously
enough some correspondents put into their
judgment of our views on space-editor

of special interest to me now as i am reading

  in your blurb for the lost city you say
mr peril is a new author if i remember
rightly he wrote dynasty of blue-black rays

regularly i notice one is a reprint keep this
up some you could publish are explorers
into infinity fire people and man on the
meteor by ray cummings blind spot by

flint  hall out of the moon by flint
ship of ishtar and seven footprints to
satan by merritt and on the brink of

tically unobtainable and im sure we readers
would like them what stories have you se-
lected for the next quarterly is it a reprint

 lished each year  to

 hand

 on the whole i believe your mag has reached
 a new high surpassing the very high standard
 you set in  there is one fault however
 the uneven edges with these the mag tears
 easily i hope you remedy this as i think most

smell the odor of mothballs about them but
the interesting really entertaining stories taken
from early issues of argosy science and in-
vention and our own magazine certainly it
would be just as easy and convenient to use
these as the ones you are now using some of
the old favorites i think would make good
reprints are the blind spot the nth man
the moon of doom the mad planet
the red dust the runaway skyscraper
the green splotches and the ark of the
covenant to my mind the above represent
some of the finest science fiction ever printed
and beat poes and vernes stuff all hollow i
dont suppose youd ever think of doing it but
if you wanted a way to increase circulation
figures why not reprint a merritts greatest
story the metal emperor which ran se-
rially in science and invention you know
im fairly spoiling for a chance to read that
story

  now for a few comments on recent issues
of a s the new serial by doctor e e smith
is better than average but in my opinion its
pretty far below his usual standard i guess
the pace he set in the skylark stories and
spacehounds was a bit too hot to keep up
still i got a tremendous kick out of the battle
between earths superspaceship and the nevian
vessel as described in the third installment of
triplanetary they say hamilton is with-
out a peer as a writer of space battles but take
my word for it he cant hold a candle to
smith in this department peril among the
drivers was an excellent adventure novelette
by bob olsen i thoroughly enjoyed every
line of it i suppose it was a sort of sequel to
the ant with a human soul victor end-
ersbys story a job of blending was pretty
good but was much much too short as was
the man who stopped the earth the new
serial by h haverstock hill who is really
j m walsh an english novelist is just fair
rather mediocre run-of-the-mill stock id call
it a descent into the maelstrom by edgar
allen poe was terrible it was only about the
fifteenth time id come across it in different
books and magazines

  in closing let me say that i am in the market
for back issues of amazing stories from
 back to the beginning anyone having
such to sell at a fair price please get in touch

  it is well to specify numbers in some cases
we receive so many letter about the contents
of amazing stories that we do not know what
to do to please everybody and this is a task
for a napoleon the proverb says please
yourself and you will please one person
the trouble with an editor is that he has to
please a multitude of people yet has to please
himself in a sense this is because unless he

does good work he will be displeased within
himself yet he runs the chance of not pleasing
his readers so you see the editor is really
between two fires in wanting to do what im-
presses one as right and also in wishing to pub-
lish what his readers will like you are a
little too hasty in your criticism of such dis-
tinguished authors as the ones you name h g
wells is a very live writer to-day edgar
allan poe is world-famous it is curious that
while you object to the reprint a decent
into the malestrom you say it has been re-
printed about fifteen times already does not
this indicate that at least fifteen editors have
agreed with us it is a long time since we
published a story by wells in  and 
we gave a number of them and we consider
that they were well received none has been
published in recent years within a few weeks

what you object to

editor amazing stories

  this is for the discussions columns any-
way lets get away from formalities of letter
openings this is a letter of protest so there
is no use beating around the bush first of all
i wish to protest loudly about the printing of
edgar allen poes stories in our mag there
is nothing worth while in the way of science in
them you are always commenting upon the
fact to your readers that you are over-stocked
with stories do you mean poes stories if
you insist on his stories why not publish another
magazine containing his complete works oh
well maybe by the time this letter is printed
if it is you will have gotten over your mania
for poe stories i would like to see in the
discussions columns the opinion of some of the
other readers of your magazine on this sub-
ject

  i heartily agree with another reader when
he says that since you have joined the nra
why not raise the price a little and then maybe
we could have smooth edges by the way the
other reader i refer to lives in this same town
i shall have to meet him

  there seems to be a great amount of con-
troversy on this subject of reprints i think you
told some of your readers that you were think-
ing favorably of giving us some of your former
stories i have not seen any yet i notice
around this town that a good many of the
people have very little interest in science
whenever i try to tell my friends anything
scientific they class me as an idiot or something
however there is one fellow that will listen to
me without laughing i try to interest some
of the rest of them but they just dont like
it i guess by the way what has happened

a canadian correspondent asks about the
ways of the moon

editor amazing stories

  your stories have always appealed to me and
so you may imagine my surprise and pleasure
when i saw amazing stories reappear in de-
cember on canadian newsstands i have not
missed a copy since the two serials were both
great stories and well written but the lost
city promises to excel both of these the
short stories are very interesting and cover a
great deal of ground

  in the man who stopped the earth by
henry kostkos the moon streaked off from the
earth at a tangent when the earth was stopped
if the earth was stopped would it still not re-
tain its influence on the moon and still cause it
to circle around it however it is only a de-
tail in a good story
