firebrand dennis brooke had one final chance to redeem him-
self by capturing koerber whose ships were the scourge of the
void but his luck had run its course and now he was marooned
on a rogue planet-fighting to save himself from a menace weap-
ons could not kill

illustration by ingels


  nd so my dear dennis detected
l  a faint irony in the phrase im
afraid i can offer no competition to the
beauties of five planets-or is it six with
regret i bozv myself out and knowing me
as you do youll understand the futility of
trying to convince me again anyway
there will be no temptation for im sailing
on a new assignment ive accepted i did
love you    good-by

dennis brooke had lost count of the
times hed read marlas last letter but

every time he came to these final poignant
lines they never failed to conjure a vision
of her tawny loveliness slender as the
palms of venus and of the blue ecstasy
of her eyes wide with a perpetual wonder
-limpid as a childs

  the barbaric rhythms of the congahua
were a background of annoyance in den-
nis mind he frowned slightly at the
maneuvers of the mercurian dancer who
writhed among the guests of the notorious
pleasure palace began to leave no doubt

the spheres rolled down in a deadly wave


	planet

as to her intentions the girl was beautiful
in a sultry almost incandescent sort of
way but her open promise left him cold
he wanted solitude somewhere to coordi-
nate his thoughts in silence and salvage
something out of the wreck of his heart
not to speak of his career but venus in
the throes of a gigantic boom upon the dis-
covery of radio-active fields could offer
only one solitude-the fatal one of her
swamps and virgin forests

  dennis brooke was thirty the time when
youth no longer seems unending when
the minor adventures of the heart begin to
pall if the loss of marla left an aching
void that all the women of five planets
could not fill the loss of space was quite
as deadly for he had been grounded
true koerbers escape from the isp net
had not quite been his fault but had he not
been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous
jovian chamber in venus fabulous inter-
planetary palace he would have been ready
for duty to complete the last link in the net
of isp cruisers that almost surrounded
the space pirate

  a night in the jovian chamber was to
be emperor for one night every dream
of a mans desire was marvelously induced
through the skilful use of hypnotics the
rarest viands and most delectable drinks
appeared as if by magic the unearthly
peace of an olympus descended on a mans
soul and beauty    beauty such as men
dreamed of was a warm reality under the
ineffable illumination of the chamber

  it cost a young fortune but to pleasure
mad boom-ridden venus a fortune was a
bagatelle only it had cost dennis brooke
far more than a sheaf of credits-it had
cost him the severe rebuff of the isp
and most of his heart in marla

  dennis sighed he tilted his red curly
head and drank deeply of the insidious
verbena fragrant as a mint garden in the
tall frosty glass of martian bacca-glas and
as he did so his brilliant hazel eyes found
themselves gazing into the unwinking vio-
let stare of a young martian at the next
table there was a smouldering hatred in
those eyes and something else    envy
perhaps or was it jealousy dennis
couldnt tell but his senses became in-
stantly alert danger brought a faint vi-
bration which his superbly trained faculties
could instantly denote

stories

  his steady bronzed hand lowered the
drink and his eyes narrowed slightly ab-
sorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden en-
mity of this martian stranger he was
unaware of the mercurian dancer the
latter had edged closer whirling in pris-
matic flashes from the myriad semi-pre-
cious stones that studded her brief gauze
skirt and now in a final bid for the
spacers favor she flung herself in his lap
and tilted back invitingly

   some of the guests laughed others stared
in plain envy at the handsome red-haired
spacer but from the table across came the
tinkling sound of a fragile glass being
crushed in a powerful hand and a muffled
martian curse without warning the mar-
tian was on his feet with the speed of an
hellacorium the table went crashing to
one side as he leaped with deadly intent on
the sprawled figure of dennis brooke a
high-pitched scream brought instant silence
as a terran girl cried out then the mar-
tians hand reached out hungrily but
dennis was not there

leaping to one side impervious to
the fall of the dancer he avoided the
murderous rush of the martian youth then
he wheeled swiftly and planted a sledge-
hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot
of all martians the spot just below their
narrow wasp-like waist and as the mar-
tian half-doubled over he leftcd him with
a short jab to the chin that staggered and
all but dropped him

  the martians violet eyes were black
with fury now he staggered back and
sucked in air his face contorted with ex-
cruciating pain but he was not through
his powerful right shot like a blast straight
for dennis chest striking like a piston just
below the heart dennis took it flat-footed
without flinching then he let his right ride
over with all the force at his command it
caught the martian on the jaw and spun
him like a top the pale imperious face
went crimson as he slowly sagged to his
knees and rolled to the impeccable mosaics
of the floor

  dennis breathing heavily stood over
him until the international police arrived
and then he had the surprise of his life
upon search the police found a tiny but
fatal silvery tube holstered under his left
arm-pit - an atomic-disintegrator forbid-
the soul eaters	

den throughout the interplanetary league
only major criminals and space pirates
still without the law were known to possess
them

  looks like your brawl has turned out
to be a piece of fools luck brooke the
police lieutenant favored dennis with a
wry smile if im not mistaken this
chaps a member of bren koerbers pirate
crew who else could afford to risk his
neck at the international and have in his
possession a disintegrator pity we have
no complete records on that devils crew
anyway well radio the isp perhaps
they have details on this dandy he eyed
admiringly the priceless martian embroid-
eries on the unconscious martians tunic
the costly border of red ocelandian fur
and the magnificent black acerine on his
finger

  dennis brooke shrugged his shoulders
shoulders that would have put to shame
the athenian statues of another age a
faint bitter smile curved his generous
mouth im grounded gillian itd take
the capture of koerber himself to set me
right with the isp again-you dont
know bertram to him an infraction of
rules is a major crime damn venus
he reached for his glass of verbena but
the table had turned over during the strug-
gle and the glass was a shattered mass of
gleaming bacca-glas shards he laughed
shortly as he became conscious of the ven-
omous stare of the mercurian dancer of
the excited voices of the guests and the
emphatic disapproval of the veriusian pro-
prietor who was shocked at having a brawl
in his ultra-expensive ultra-exclusive pal-
ace

  better come to headquarters with me
dennis the lieutenant said gently well
say you captured him and if hes koer-
bers the credits yours a trip to terras
what you need venus for you is a hoo-
doo

the stern white haired isp
commander behind the immense alu-
minil desk frowned slightly as dennis
brooke entered he eyed the six foot four
frame of the captain before him with a
mixture of feelings as if uncertain how to
begin finally he sighed as if having
come to a decision he were forcing himself
to speak

  sit down dennis ive sent for you
despite your grounding for two reasons
the first one you already know-your cap-
ture of one of koerbers henchmen-has
given us a line as to his present orbit of
piracy and the means of a check on his
activities but thats not really why ive
brought you here he frowned again as
if what he had to say were difficult indeed

  marla starland your fiancee accepted
an assignment we offered her-a delicate
piece of work here on terra that only a
very beautiful and very clever young lady
could perform and he paused grimac-
ing somewhere between venus and terra
the interplanetary spacer bringing her and
several other passengers began to send dis-
tress signals finally we couldnt contact
the ship any more it is three days over-
due all passengers a cargo of radium
from venus worth untold millions the
spacer itself-seem to have vanished

  dennis brookes space-tanned features
had gone pale his large hazel eyes
fringed with auburn lashes too long for a
man were bright slits that smouldered
he stood silent his hands clenched at his
sides while something cold and sharp
seemed to dig at his heart with cruel pre-
cision

  marla he breathed at last the
thought of marla in the power of koerber
sent a wave of anguish that seared through
him like an atomic-blast

  commander dennis said and his rich
baritone voice had depths of emotion so
great that they startled commander ber-
tram himself-and that grizzled veteran of
the isp had at one time or another
known every change of torture that could
possibly be wrung on a human soul com-
mander give me one    one chance at
that spawn of unthinkable begetting let
me try and i promise you    in his tor-
ture dennis was unconsciously banging a
knotted fist on the chaste satiny surface of
the priceless desk i promise you that i
will either bring you koerber or forfeit
my life

  commander bertram nodded his head
i brought you here for that purpose son
we have reached a point in our war with
koerber where the last stakes must be
played    and the last stake is death

  he reached over and flipped up the ac-
tivator on a small telecast set on his desk
	planet

instantly the viso-screen lighted up youll
now see a visual record of all we know
about the passenger spacer that left venus
with passengers and cargo as far as we
could contact the vessel in space this
dennis the commander emphasized his
words is your chance to redeem your-
self  he fell silent while the viso-screen
began to show a crowded space port on
venus and a gigantic passenger spacer up-
tilted in its cradle

they watched the parabola it made in
its trajectory as it flashed into space
and then fell into orbit three beyond the
planetary attraction of venus on the
three-dimensional viso-screen it was uncan-
nily real

  a flight that had taken many hours to
accomplish was shortened on the viso-
screen to a matter of minutes they saw
the great proud interplanetary transport
speeding majestically through the starry
void and suddenly they saw her swerve in
a great arc again she swerved as if avoid-
ing something deadly in space and point
upwards gaining altitude it was zig-zag-
ging now desperately maneuvering in an
erratic course and as if by magic a tiny
spot appeared on the transports side

   tiny on the viso-screen the fatal spots
must have been huge in actuality to the
commander of the isp and to captain
brooke it was an old story atom-blasts
were pitting the spacers hull with deadly
genton shells the great transport trem-
bled under the impact of the barrage and
suddenly the screen went blank

  commander bertram turned slowly to
face the young isp captain whose fea-
tures were a mask devoid of all expression
now save for the pallor and the burning
fire in his eyes

  and thats the sixth one in a month
sometimes the survivors reach terra in
emergency spacers or are picked up in
space by other transports    and some-
times son    well as you know sometimes
theyre never seen again

  when do i leave commander den-
nis brookes voice was like a javelin of ice

  right now if you wish we have a
new cruiser armored in beryloid with dou-
ble hull-a new design against genton
shells but its the speed of the thing that
youll want to know about it just about

stories

surpasses anything ever invented get the
figures and data from the coordination
room son its serviced and fueled and the
crews aboard he extended his hand
youre the best spacer we have-aside
from your recklessness-and on your suc-
cess depends far more than the capture of
an outlaw bertram smiled thinly hap-
py landing

ii

their nerves were ragged days and
days of fruitless search for a phantom
ship that seemed to have vanished from
space and an equally elusive pirate whose
whereabouts were hidden in the depths of
fathomless space

   to all but captain brooke this was a
new adventure their first assignment to
duty in a search that went beyond the realm
of the inner planets where men spent sleep-
less nights in eternal vigilance against stray
asteroids and outlaw crews of ruthless van-
dal ships even their cruiser was a new
experience the long tapering fighter
lacked the luxurious offices and appoint-
ments of the regular isp patrol spacers
it placed a maximum on speed and all
available space was hoarded for fuel the
lightning fast tiger of the space-lanes was
a thing of beauty but of grim sleek beauty
instinct with power not the comfortable
luxury that they knew

   day after day they went through their
drills donning space suits manning battle
stations aiming deadly atom-cannon at
empty space and eternally scanning the
vast empty readies by means of the telecast

   and suddenly out of the void as they
had all but given up the search as a wild
goose chase a speck was limned in the
lighted surface of the viso-screen in the
control room instantly the isp cruiser
came to life in a burst of magnificent
speed the cruiser literally devoured the
space leagues until the spacer became a
flashing streak on the viso-screen the
speck grew larger took on contours grow-
ing and becoming slowly the drifting shell
of what had been a transport

   presently they were within reaching dis-
tance and captain brooke commanded
through the teleradio from the control
room

   prepare to board
the soul eaters	

  every member of the crew wanted to be
among the boarding party for all but
george randall the junior member of the
crew had served his apprenticeship among
the inner planets mars venus and terra
he felt nauseated at the very thought of
going out there in that vast abyss of space
his young beardless face with the candid
blue eyes went pale when the order was
given but presently captain brooke
named those who were to go beside him-
self 

  you tom and scotty take one emerg-
ency plane and dallas

  yes captain dallas bernan the im-
mense third lieutenant boomed in his basso-
profundo voice

  you and ill take a second emergency
there was a pause in the voice of the cap-
tain from the control room then test
space suits text oxygen helmets atomo-
blasts only ready in five minutes

  george randall breathed a sigh of relief
he watched them bridge the space to the
drifting wreck then saw them enter what
had once been a proud interplanetary liner
now soon to be but drifting dust and he
turned away with a look of shame

  inside the liner captain dennis brooke
had finished making a detailed survey

  no doubt about it he spoke through
the radio in his helmet cargo missing
no survivors no indication that the re-
pulsion fields were out of order and final-
ly those genton shells could only have
been fired by koerber he tried to main-
tain a calm exterior but inwardly he
seethed in a cold fury more deadly than
any he had ever experienced somehow
he had expected to find at least one com-
partment unharmed where life might have
endured but now all hope was gone only
a great resolve to deal with koerber once
and for all remained to him

  dennis tried not to think of marla too
great an ache was involved in thinking of
her and all he had lost when he finally
spoke his voice was harsh laconic
prepare to return

  scotty byrnes the cruisers nurse who
could take his motors through a major bat-
tle or hell and high water and back again
for that matter shifted the venusian weed
that made a perpetual bulge on his cheek
and gazed curiously at captain brooke
they all knew the story in various versions

and with special additions but they were
spacemen implicit in their loyalty and with
dennis brooke they could and did feel safe

  tom jeffery the tall angular and red-
faced navigator whose slow easygoing
movements belied the feral persistence of
a tiger and the swiftness of a striking
cobra in a fight led the small procession
of men toward the emergency planes be-
hind him came dallas bernan third lieu-
tenant looming like a young asteroid in his
space suit followed by scotty and finally
captain brooke himself all left in si-
lence as if the tragedy that had occurred
aboard the wrecked liner had touched them
intimately

aboard the isp cruiser a surprise
awaited them it was young george
randall whose excited face met them as
soon as they had entered the airlocks and
removed the space suits

  captain brooke    captain recordings
are showing on the new jet analyzers
must be the trail of some spacer cant be
far he was fairly dancing in his ex-
citement as if the marvelous work of the
new invention that detected the disturbance
of atomic jets at great distance were his
own achievement

  dennis brooke smiled his own heart
was hammering and inwardly he prayed
that it were koerber it had to be no
interplanetary passenger spacer could pos-
sibly be out here at the intersection of an-
gles kp  degrees  minutes fp  de-
grees of ceres elliptic plane none but a
pirate crew with swift battle cruisers could
dare this was the dangerous asteroid
belt where even planetoids drifted in eccen-
tric uncharted orbits

  dennis tom jeffery and scotty byrne
raced to the control room followed by the
ponderous dallas to whom hurry in any
form was anathema there could be no
doubt now the jet analyzer recorded
powerful disturbance atomic-could be
nothing else

  instantly captain brooke was at the
inter-communication speaker

  crew battle stations engine room
full speed

  scotty byrnes was already dashing to the
engine room where his beloved motors
purred with an ascending hum aboard
the isp cruiser each member of the


planet stories

crew raced to his assigned task without
delay action impended and after days
and nights of inertia it was a blessed re-
lief smiles appeared on haggard faces
and the banter of men suddenly galvan-
ized by a powerful incentive was bandied
back and forth all but george randall
now that action was imminent some-
thing gripped his throat until he could
hardly stand the tight collar of his isp
uniform a growing nausea gripped his
bowels and although he strove to keep
calm his hands trembled beyond control

  in the compact super-armored control
room captain brooke watched the tele-
casts viso-screen with hungry eyes that
were golden with anticipation it seemed
to him as if an eternity passed before at
last a black speck danced on the illuminated
screen until it finally reached the center
of the viso-screen and remained there it
grew by leaps and bounds as the terrific
speed of the cruiser minimized the distance
long before the quarry was aware of pur-
suit

  but at last when the enemy cruiser
showed on the viso-screen unmistakably
for what it was-a pirate craft it showed
by its sudden maneuver that it had de-
tected the isp cruiser for it had de-
scribed a parabola in space and headed for
the dangerous asteroid belt as if navi-
gated by a masterly hand that knew each
and every orbit of the asteroids it plunged
directly into the asteroid drift hoping to
lose the isp cruiser with such a maneu-
ver ordinarily it would have succeeded
no isp patrol ship would have dared to
venture into such a trap without specific
orders but to dennis brooke directing the
chase from the control room even certain
death was welcome if only he could take
koerber with him

  weaving through the deadly belt for
several hours dennis saw his quarry slow
down instantly he seized the chance and
ordered a salvo from starboard koerbers
powerful spacer reeled dived and came up
spewing genton-shells the battle was on
at last

  from the banked atomic-cannon of the

isp cruiser a deadly curtain of atomic
fire blazed at the pirate craft a ragged
rent back toward midship showed on
koerbers cruiser which trembled as if
it had been mortally wounded then den-

nis maneuvered his cruiser into a power
dive as a rain of genton-shells swept the
space lane above him but as he came up a
lone shell struck at such close range
super-armor was ripped second armor
penetrated and the magnificent vessel shook
under the detonating impact

  it was then that dennis brooke saw
the immense dark shadow looming imme-
diately behind koerbers ship he saw
the pirate cruiser zoom desperately in an
effort to break the gravity trap of the
looming mass but too late it struggled
like a fly caught in a spider-web to no
avail it was then that koerber played bis
last card sensing he was doomed he tried
to draw the isp cruiser down with him
a powerful magnetic beam lashed out to
spear the isp cruiser

with a wrenching turn that almost
threw them out of control dennis
maneuvered to avoid the beam again
koerbers beam lashed out as he sank
lower into the looming mass and again
dennis anticipating the maneuver avoided
it

  george randall he shouted desper-
ately into the speaker cut all jets in the
rocket room hurry man he banked
again and then zoomed out of the increas-
ing gravity trap

  randall ive got to use the magnetic
repulsion plates    cut all the jets  but
there was no response randalls screen
remained blank then koerbers lashing
magnetic beam touched and the isp ship
was caught forced to follow the pirate
ships plunge like the weight at the end of
a whiplash koerbers gunners sent one
parting shot an atomic-blast that shook
the trapped cruiser like a leaf

  beneath them growing larger by the
second a small world rushed up to meet
them the readings in the planetograph
seemed to have gone crazy it showed
diameter  miles composition mineral
and radio-active gravity seven-eighths of
terra it couldnt be unless perhaps
this unknown planetoid was the legendary
core of the world that at one time was sup-
posed to have existed between jupiter and
mars only that could possibly explain
the incredible gravity

  and then began another type of battle
hearing the captains orders to randall
the soul eaters



and noting that no result had been obtained
scotty byrnes himself cut the jets the
magnetic repulsion plates went into ac-
tion too late to save them from being
drawn but at least they could prevent a
crash far in the distance they could see
koerbers ship preceding them in a free
fall then the planetoid was rushing up to
engulf them

ill

the atmosphere was somewhat tenu-
ous but it was breathable provided
a man didnt exert himself to the silent
crew of the isp cruiser the strange
world to which koerbers magnetic beam
had drawn them was anything but reassur-
ing towering crags jutted raggedly
against the sky and the iridescent soil
of the narrow valley that walled in the
cruiser had a poisonous deadly look as
far as their eyes could reach the desolate
denuded vista stretched to the horizon

  pretty much of a mess dennis
brookes face was impassive as he turned
to scotty byrnes whats your opinion
think we can patch her up or are we
stuck here indefinitely

  spotty eyed the damage the atom-blast
had penetrated the hull into the forward
fuel chambers and the armor had blos-
somed out like flower petals the crash-
landing had not helped either

  well theres a few beryloid plates in
the storage locker captain but he
scratched his head ruminatively and shifted
his precious cud

  but what speak up man it was
tom jeffery his nerves on edge his ordi-
narily gentle voice like a lash

  but you may as well know it scotty
replied quietly that parting shot of
koerbers severed our main rocket feed
i had to use the emergency tank to make it
down here

  for a long moment the four men looked
at each other in silence dennis brookes
face was still impassive but for the flaming
hazel eyes tom tugged at the torn sleeve
of his isp uniform while scotty gazed
mournfully at the damaged ship dallas
bernan looked at the long ragged line of
cliffs

  i think we got koerber though he
said at last while tom was doing a job

of navigation i had one last glimpse of him
coming down fast and out of control some-
where behind those crags over there

  to hell with koerber tom jeffery
exploded you mean were stuck in this
hellish rock-pile

  easy tom captain brookes tones
were like ice on his pale impassive face
his eyes were like flaming topaz wheres
randall

  probably hiding his head under a
bunk dallas laughed with scorn his
contemptuous remark voiced the feelings
of the entire crew a man who failed to
be at his battle-station in time of emerg-
ency had no place in the isp

  considering the gravity of this plan-
etoid dennis brooke said thoughtfully
its going to take some blast to get us off

  maybe we can locate a deposit of ane-
rioum or uranium or something for our
atom-busters to chew on scotty said
hopefully he was an eternal optimist

  better break out those repair plates
dennis said to scotty tom you get the
welders ready ive got a few entries to
make in the log book and then well decide
on a party to explore the terrain and try
to find out what happened to koerbers
ship i must know he said in a low voice
but with such passion that the others were
startled

  a figure appeared in the slanting door-
way of the ship in time to hear the last
words it was george randall adjusting
a bandaged forehead bumped during the
crash landing

  captain  i  i wanted   he
paused unable to continue

  you wanted what captain brookes
voice was terse perhaps you wanted to
explain why you werent at your battle
station 

  sir i wanted to know if  if i might
help scotty with the welding job   
that wasnt at all what hed intended to
say but somehow the words had stuck
in his throat and his face flushed deep scar-
let his candid blue eyes were suspiciously
brilliant and the white bandage with its
crimson stains made an appealing boyish
figure it softened the anger in brookes
heart thinking it over calmly dennis
realized this was the youngsters first trip
into the outer orbits and better men than
he had cracked in those vast reaches of
	planet

space but there had been an instant when
hed found randall cowering in the rocket-
room in the grip of paralyzing hysteria
when he could cheerfully have wrung his
neck

  certainly randall he replied in a
much more kindly tone well need all
hands now

  thank you sir randall seemed to
hesitate for a moment opened his mouth
to speak further but feeling the others
calculating gaze upon him he whirled and
re-entered the ship

  but for him we wouldnt be here
dallas exclaimed aagh  he shook his
head in disgust until the several folds of
flesh under his chin shook like gelatin
cowards are hell he spat

  easy dallas randalls a kid give im
a chance dennis observed

  you captain    youre defending im
why you had a greater stake in this than
we and hes spoiled it for you

  yep dennis nodded but im still
keeping my senses clear no feuds on my
ship get it the last two words cut
like a scimitar

  dallas nodded and lowered his eyes
scotty shifted his cud and spat a thin
stream of juice over the iridescent ground
one by one they re-entered the cruiser

absorbedly randall added finish-
ing flourishes to the plate of beryloid
he had just finished welding with the
heavy atomic welder in his hands he
paused to inspect the job inwardly he
wished that scotty and dallas would hurry
with that final plate he could just barely
hear them pounding it into shape within
the cruiser unconsciously he shivered

  outside the cruiser it was cold and
breathing was laborious for despite the
gravity the atmosphere was thin diffused
besides this shadowy world of dark crags
and palely creeping sunlight had an un-
canny feel as if it were evil for the
hundredth time he twisted around and sur-
veyed the rocky terrain behind him de-
terminedly he squared his shoulders and
jutted out his chin it was bad enough to
have muffed a chance to add glory to the

isp not to speak of having the rest of
the crew think him demented still the
feeling of being watched persisted ran-
dall cursed his imagination and over-

wrought nerves that made him feel what
palpably didnt exist he closed his young
eyes for a second and strove to steady his
nerves

  he breathed deeply of the tenuous at-
mosphere and exhaled slowly then he
opened his eyes feeling more calm and
turned to make one final survey and stood
rooted to the ground as if petrified

  from a dark crevice in the jagged wall
behind the isp spacer something seemed
to glide effortlessly into the open about
twenty feet from randall it paused and re-
mained stationary hovering above the
rocky surface it was perfectly spherical
fully three feet in diameter and had george
randall not been hysterical with dread he
would have seen that it was exquisitely
beautiful a softly shining transparent
globe that pulsed rhythmically with lam-
bent fires a wavering lavender corona
like an aura surrounded it as it began to
spin slowly

  from nerveless hands the atomic welder
dropped to the ground as a wave of surg-
ing panic engulfed randall with an eerie
half-strangled scream he clawed for the
atom-blast at his hip he had a brief im-
pression that the globe was sentiently alive
and that something that felt like tenils
of fire probed his brain his hair stood on
end as the icy fear deepened to the verge
of madness

  scotty dallas  he shouted and
then realized he couldnt be heard above
the pounding within the cruiser he aimed
at the globe and squeezed the trigger the
tremendous energy released by the atom-
blast flung the globe back by blasting the
surrounding air in furious waves but re-
gaining its equilibrium the globe began to
zoom forward again undamaged

  randall waited no longer he raced for
the open hatch of the cruiser with the speed
of horror he scrambled madly almost
dived into the opening and had the pres-
ence of mind to pull the lever that slammed
the door shut behind him he lay there
panting completely unnerved by the ex-
perience

  dishevelled and horror-stricken was the
way scotty and dallas found him when on
hearing the hatch clang shut they rushed
in to investigate

  what happened an attack koerbers
men scotty queried
the soul eaters	

  speak up randall dallas shook him
briefly what was it you look as if
youd seen a ghost

  theres something out there  i dont
know what it is but its alive it almost
got me he shuddered

  something alive on this barren world
unless it was one of koerbers men youve
been seeing ghosts again kid scotty said
not unkindly he was well aware of space-
mens mirage the affliction that sometimes
drove newcomers mad

  it was real randall persisted and
it was alive  a glowing globe of energy
that hung just above me a few feet away
i blasted at it with my gun and it just
spun then came forward

he rose from the floor and moved
over to the starboard port to look
outside scotty and dallas stood beside
him they gazed curiously in every direc-
tion as far as they could see

  dont see a thing dallas said stolidly
come on son ill fix you a sedative
he said contemptuously

  wait a minute dallas scotty inter-
rupted randalls right take a look at
that bcf pile of rocks over there  to the
left dallas

  by the red-tailed picaroons on jupiters
satellites dallas swore swiftly ive
seen a lot of queer sights but nothing like
this he exclaimed suddenly he turned
to randall how do you know its alive
for all we know its just a globe of radio-
active energy native to this hell-spot
randall colored hesitated and finally
blurted out i  i just felt it was alive
i sensed it trying to contact my mind   
oh i know it sounds crazy i know youll
laugh but the thing was trying to probe my
brain dallas

  scotty suddenly thought of captain
brooke and tom jeffery who had gone on
an exploratory trip i wonder about the
captain and tom he said in alarm if
theres one of these whirling demons on
this rock theres sure to be others he
raced to the communications set and turned
it on but it was silent

dallas gazed at randall for a second with
a faint scornful smile alive eh well
see he patted the atom-blast at his hip
never saw nothin dangerous yet that

this couldnt put a hole through he ex-
claimed inelegantly

  hold on dallas the more prudent
scotty tried to dissuade him if that
things radio-active it may be deadly
were not afraid of it man    but we
dont know what it is

  you boys stay and play the radio
dallas turned lightly on his feet for all his
tremendous bulk and soon the airlock had
hissed open and he was gone

  both scotty and randall watched him
half-fearful half in admiration as he strode
away from the cruiser the luminous iri-
descent sphere hovering over the rocks
whirled faster and faster as dallas moved
away from the ship rapidly the whirling
accelerated until it was a pulsing vortex of
exquisite hues of living light then it
began to move slowly forward toward the
walking man

  in the macabre landscape of the plane-
toid the rotund dallas was not unlike a
sphere himself as gun in hand he unhesi-
tatingly went forward to meet the globe
calmly he aimed the atom-blast and sud-
denly there was a flash from the muzzle of
the gun but the flood of vicious atomic
energy failed to harm the globe on the con-
trary it seemed to flame in a cataract of
colors flaming into living light then the
fluorescent flare died down to normal again
and the sphere stopped motionless as if it
were appraising dallas

  in unfeigned wonder the blimp-like dal-
las bernan stared at the globe a full
charge from the blaster and the damn thing
takes it like a drink of milk he murmured
audibly reaching over he picked up a
good sized rock and threw it at the sphere
but the rock bounced back as if it had hit
an impenetrable wall of energy the globe
was unharmed it merely hung there qui-
escent now as if observing the strange
creature from another planet that had sud-
denly appeared

  another rock followed the first then an-
other and another until rocks were flying in
every direction as they rebounded from the
globe and dallas began to laugh to
his matter-of-fact mind the sphere was
merely a bunch of radio-active gas that
repelled matter of certain types like the
stones he had thrown and was drawn by
organic matter a bunch of gas he
roared and the globe was retreating

floating backwards effortlessly whirling
faster and faster until as dallas flung a
final rock it darted upward and swiftly dis-
appeared down the great valley as dallas
turned to go back to the cruiser a flicker
of movement caught his eye instantly he
aimed his atom-blast but as quickly low-
ered and a joyous expression came into
his vast face

  clambering down the tumbled rocks and
boulders just ahead of the spacer captain
brooke and tom jeffery were hurrying
toward him the latter carrying the insul-
ated leadite specimen box

  hiya captain we just laid a ghost
see our pretty company dallas roared
with laughter

  yes we saw it captain brooke re-
plied what was it  looked like a trans-
parent globe of some sort radioactive

  naw just a bunch of gas dallas
explained

  well we have another kind of company
   about twenty miles from here dennis
said grimly get into the ship were hold-
ing a conference dallas

seated in the small dining-room of the
cruiser the entire crew listened to the
captains report on their trip while scotty
brewed coffee skillfully and cocked his ears
to the narrative tom laid the leadite
specimen box on the table without a word
then sat back

  ill cut corners on this he began be-
cause we have a lot to do and a very short
time to do it in approximately twenty
miles westwards theres a cavern that runs
through the crags around us jeffery and
i started to explore it but fortunately
stopped just in time it happens that koer-
ber and his thugs have landed on the other
side of the crags this cave is filled with
some sort of radioactive mineral unfor-
tunately the main deposits are at the other
end of the cavern system and koerber and
his gang are already in possession he
must have crashed there pity the situa-
tion is not reversed wed have ample fuel
then

  but captain randall spoke impulsive-
ly why cant we get some of the mineral
from this end of the cavern and blast off
this awful place

  dallas gave the youngster a look of
withering disgust from across the table

  no good tom jeffery answered for
the captain without looking at randall
the stuff at this ends mostly rubble we
had to dig the better part of an hour to find
a piece rich enough to use he pointed to
the leadite box

  the plan is simplicity itself captain
brooke continued well use this speci-
men for fuel to zoom over the crags and
attack koerber    weve got to take pos-
session of the other end of the cave with-
out sufficient fuel we cant fight koerber
to a finish and i intend to go into that
black cruiser of his if i have to crack it
open like a venusian palm-nut

  dallas and scottys eyes glowed any
time you say captain the latter said
eagerly cruisers hulls finished but for
a few minor touches just give the word 

iv

captain brooke tightened his
safety belt thoughtfully then his
glance travelled slowly to where lieutenant
jeffery sat fingers poised over the gleam-
ing bank of keys

  t suppose we really should test this
specimen first the captain observed
however if we did i doubt if wed have
enough left for fuel to smash koerber
he flipped a tiny switch in the panel be-
fore him the silver screen lighted and
scottys features appeared

  ready n waiting on the firing line
capn

  switch over to relays and strap in
scotty ill give you thirty seconds dennis
grinned then turned to jeffery

  ready lieutenant

  jeffery took one more look into the v-
screen made a last second check of his
objective-the high peak about twenty
miles down the valley as soon as the
peak was reached the cruiser would be
under full manual control and he would
dart the swift sky-tiger from the heights
down on koerbers spacer in a terrific
power dive he nodded satisfied yes
sir ready

  take off the command whipped out
and jefferys fingers flashed over the rows
of keys with automatic precision for the
fraction of a second there was a muffled
rumbling thunder then both dennis
brooke and jeffery were slammed back
the soul eaters	

against their air-cushions as the astound-
ing crescendo of acceleration hit them

  twisting his head slowly captain den-
nis looked at his navigator in astonishment
tom jeffery had always been the acme of
dependability his precision in plotting had
practically become a legend in the isp

  cruisers running wild  jeffery gasped
painfully the key bank must  be
out  of order id never    never use
that much speed on take-off

  slack off   dennis gritted he saw
jeffery struggle to get his long supple
hands back on the keys blood throbbed
and pounded in surging waves at his tem-
ples and he knew hed black out in a mat-
ter of seconds if his navigator didnt reach
those keys

  concentrating all his remaining energy
jeffery reached and pushed one hand for-
ward but it was like pushing against an
invisible wall his hand refused to move
any further and then he felt the impene-
trable blackness welling up inside his brain
nervelessly the navigators hand dropped
but two fingers scraped over the key-bank
and the flashing cruiser changed its course
the ship angled upward sharply and grad-
ually reduced its speed like two punch-
drunk mortals dennis and jeffery shook
their heads doggedly trying to clear the
clinging black webs from their brains

  they were not unnerved for to these
two danger was too familiar a face it was
a constant shadow at their heels the eternal
companion at their table-without it life
would have seemed flat without zest

  worse than a shot of martian absy-
tron whew jeffery exclaimed startled
out of his usually laconic state that
minerals terrific

  i was just thinking the same thing
captain brooke agreed quietly which
makes it doubly important that we settle
scores with koerber and leave this plane-
toid if the reaction of this minerals true
weve found a new type of fuel far more
powerful than anything known to us at
present

  imagine if that space-rat gets hold of
it jeffery concurred in awed tones he
could rule the space-lanes commit any
crime and outpace any ship in the uni-
verse 

  besides dennis said ruminatively this
minerald make terra independent of ve-

nus for her supply of radioactives it
would usher in a new era jeffery

  suddenly it seemed to dennis that there
was even more at stake than the smashing
of a dangerous outlaw than the recovery
of his former state in the isp or the
avenging of marla if she were dead-the
destiny of terra was at stake too as if
one of those cross-roads of life at which
an individual is sometimes poised by fate
had opened before his gaze and history
awaited being written in the invisible pages
of space he had come prepared to die to
fulfill a mission-but now matters had
changed the need was not to die but to
live that an unsuspecting world might rise
to new heights of achievement on the in-
credibly radioactive marvel of this un-
known planetoid with a swift movement
he threw on the panel switch and his voice
boomed out

  all hands attention koerber has seen
us no doubt but whether or not hes fore-
warned we attack as scheduled stand-
by

  the isp cruiser swept back up the
long valley until it was almost opposite the
pirates camp only the tremendous moun-
tain range separated them glancing at the
banks of keys the instruments and dials
under the v-screen dennis issued orders
scotty give it everything you have
he grinned as scotty gave back one of his
inimitable replies

  dallas

  yes sir

  take the stern turret and start firing
when we pull out-angle thirty-eight pre-
cision  he again threw a quick glance at
the panel

  randall take forward position sec-
ondary turret hold fire till they open up
or until i give you the command got it 
yes sir randalls voice was tense

  it was then captain dennis turned to
his navigator ill take the main forward
turret myself jeffery now use a thirty-
five degree dive pull out at five-hundred
feet and use ma- to pull out and regain
altitude he grinned fleetingly at the
startled jeffery

  but    but youre going to man the
forward turret-get the gunner capn   
i    but dennis silenced him with a
swift gesture

  taking no chances i want to be sure
	planet

that spawn of barrabass smeared if i have
to do it myself

the long gleaming cruiser was like
the spear of the angel gabriel un-
erring fatal as the skillful fingers of its
navigator in the control room swept over
the keys and the ship obediently canted
downward suddenly it took the plunge
in a supernal power-dive that sent it hur-
tling straight at the pirates camp below
all around the cruiser a rain of genton-
shells exploded in buffeting succession as
the cruiser quivered and strained holding
the dizzying dive

  from the main forward turret a stream
of fire scorched the surroundings below
starting great fires on the stacked supplies
which had been removed from koerbers
ship to facilitate repairs the atomo-blast
raised clouds of iridescent mineral as it
peeled the ground like a gigantic knife
but the genton-shells prevented close aim
as the explosions buffeted the cruiser off
her course captain dennis finally came
into the control room

  they saw us all right he growled
angrily i wasnt able to come closer
than a hundred feet of koerbers ship with
the gun

  theyve almost got us boxed in sir i
cant hold her on much longer

  all right then jeffery pull out   
right bank    that should throw them off
long enough for us to break away give
me a few seconds to adjust my sights im
going back to the turret

  the great cruiser had reached its objec-
tive and swept like a stupendous bird of
death over the pirate camp spewing a rain
of death two pirates caught behind
mounds of supplies and provisions were
blasted together with the boxes that pro-
tected them the stern turret of the black
pirate cruiser was a melting incandescent
mass as captain brookes atom-blast
found its mark suddenly the meteor-like
vessel canted to the right and zoomed up-
ward at the same time then with verti-
ginous speed flashed beyond the range of
the pirates full fire-power leaving koer-
ber cursing in impotent fury the sound of
wracking concussions died away the un-
earthly ascending whine of the atom-blasts
ceased and the cruiser flashed back to base
at least well have a choice this time

stories

where to set the ship down lieutenant
jeffery said wryly as he watched the
changed scene on the v-screen before him

  watching also dennis brooke suddenly
leaned forward with great interest but
abruptly the emergency thermo-bulb flashed
on and off and a shrill buzzer sounded
dennis threw the switch quickly

  well have to set her down capn
scotty announced shes reached the dan-
ger mark

hell jeffery exclaimed succinctly
set her down  dennis ordered but
the ship was already headed groundwards

  the air lock on the cruiser opened and
the crew jumped to the ground it was the
same bizarre landscape harsh dantesque
extreme

  since weve reached a temporary im-
passe the captain explained to them we
may at least examine something i happened
to see just prior to landing i have a vague
idea concerning this small world it is just
possible i may be right

  what did you see sir randall for-
ever impulsive and emotional asked curi-
ously apprehensive

  you probably wont like the idea so
much lieutenant captain brooke said
quietly shifting the weight of his atom-
blast on his hip he smiled thinly were
going to investigate some of those play-
mates of yours-the spheres

  randalls face tightened with a peculiar
expression he started to speak then not-
ing dallas sardonic smile he stopped

  just before we landed the captain
continued i saw a large pit filled with the
globes up in the plateau just ahead i want
to try an experiment from what i saw
happened with you dallas when you tried
to blast that globe and then threw rocks at
it and it went away and yet it pursued
randall    well i have a theory that i
want to test if it works we may yet turn
the tables on koerber

with perfect confidence captain
dennis turned and began to stride to-
ward the plateau in the near distance with-
out hesitation dallas strode behind him fol-
lowed by scotty and jeffery and a few
other lesser members of the crew only
randall hesitated as if an awful premoni-
tion paralyzed his steps he seemed to
make an heroic effort and hesitantly at
the soul eaters	

first then with greater confidence he began
to follow the leaders

  at last they were standing at the rim
of the vast pit looking down dennis real-
ized it must be all of a mile in width it
seemed filled with clusters of the globes
which vibrated gently at the bottom

  millions of the damned things dallas
exclaimed

  the pit sloped down to a point at the
center of the bottom and there was the
immense cluster of globes that dennis had
seen from small ones the size of thermo-
bulbs to gigantic spheres fully six feet
in diameter it was a pulsating shimmering
mass of changing opalescences a seething
cauldron of prismatic hues dormant now
but ready to flame into living light

  randall the last to arrive approached
the edge and gazed down the ethereal
ghostly seeming spheres with their pulsat-
ing auras sent an icy shiver of dread along
his taut nerves he shuddered and turned
to the others lets go he said hoarsely
those demons might come floating up
here there was a hysterical quality to
his voice that did not pass unnoticed to
captain dennis who was observing him
closely lets go randall cried again
his face contorted

  suddenly there was a stream of move-
ment below from the central mass of
globes several detached themselves and
floated silently upwards in swirls of living
light

  cold unreasoning fear surged into ran-
dalls mind in his hysteria the spheres
were coming after him his thin face
with the wide fear-stricken blue eyes wag
ashen while his lips twitched to form words
that failed to come at last he managed to
scream run  theyre coming after us
and randall was racing pell-mell back to
the spacer

  captain dennis stood his ground dallas
beside him come here you fool den-
nis cried exasperated but it was too late
with flashing speed two of the spheres
outraced randall and now hovered over
him they were whirling into a vortex of
incredible light lovely beyond description
and beneath them convulsed with horror
randall raced for his life

  action dennis shouted instantly sev-
eral atom-blasts spewed their deadly charge
into the two pursuing globes they drank

in the awful energy charge and glowed
supernally vivid still unharmed then
swooping downwards they charged ran-
dall and the boy was fighting them flail-
ing his amis wildly haphazardly trying to
fend them off the other members of the
party had now held their fire for randall
was enmeshed in the luminous globes and
suddenly the globes seemed to become part
of the boys body enveloping it in their
translucent fatal embrace

  before their eyes they saw the boyish
form shrivel and fall crumpled to the
ground as if all the energy had been ab-
sorbed in that unearthly embrace of living
light in an instant it was over

v

lazily the two spheres floated up-
ward their fire deepening into swirls
of colors swirling slowly over the pros-
trate figure as if exulting

  unutterable horror showed in captain
brookes eyes then flaming anger shook
him the dirty   dennis ground out
the words from set taubps furiously he
began blasting at the globes the spheres
rocked and twisted in the tortured air cur-
rents then gradually they rose and floated
up the valley

  dennis kneeled beside the still form of
randall slid his hand under the boys
jacket he rose slowly and faced the rest
of the awed crew his eyes topaz slits of
consuming fury

  now we know how dangerous how
deadly those entities are for make no mis-
take they are entities a strange un-
earthly form of life that can suck a mans
life-energy randall had good reason to be
afraid poor kid those globes react to the
most powerful of the emotions and fear
being perhaps one of the strongest uner-
ringly draws them i feel somehow re-
sponsible for this boys death still he has
not died in vain for in his sacrifice he has
given us a clue to koerbers ultimate de-
feat he paused gazing somberly at the
still form at his feet remember he died
a hero for whatever success we may have
we shall owe to him

  rocks iridescent and vari-hued were
piled high into a cairn making randalls
last resting place in the depths of the
space he had feared so
	planet

  the remaining members of the crew
walked back slowly to the waiting ship
a dark silence hung over the group as they
filed to their respective sleeping quarters
all but captain dennis dallas jeffery and
scotty who went on to their council room
quietly they took their places at the small
table jeffery sat with his long hands on
his lap silent while scotty methodically
tamped down the venusian tobacco with
which he had filled his blackened pipe
dallas said nothing his vast bulk over-
flowed the seat and his tremendous chest
heaved with emotions alien to his nature
all of them seemed to be waiting for cap-
tain dennis brookes words the latter sat
down last absorbed in thought when he
spoke his voice was quiet sombre almost

  i told you he began without pre-
amble that i had a vague theory about
those spheres well i know now randall
proved it this afternoon there can be no
doubt that those globes are radio-active-
the way they react to our atomo-guns leads
me to believe that they subsist on energy-
radiant energy from the mineral and radio-
actives of this planetoid their atomic scale
must be such that their component atoms
make up the two mining elements in our
atomic scale this is the first time that man
has ever encountered these two elements
and of course this is the first time these
spheres have ever encountered humans-
organic life-on an atomic scale so far
removed from their own naturally theyre
curious they tried to investigate and
what they encountered from randall was
fear perhaps the second strongest emo-
tion our fear must send out intangible
vibrations that impinge harshly upon their
own vibrations and lead them to attack
what fear arouses in them we shall prob-
ably never know the fact is that our hu-
man emotion of fear in conflict with their
vibratory rate renders them fatal and
even seems to draw them with a strange
magnetic attraction

  for a moment every one of the four
was silent as the explanation cleared so
much of the mystery before them then
captain dennis walked over to the locker
where the space-suits were racked he
began slipping into one of the bulky suits

  im going outside again if this spacers
insulation against the spheres theres no
reason why a space-suit should not be also

stories

two of you cover me from the stern tur-
ret and two-including a crew member
from the forward turret you can at least
delay their attack by blasting air currents
in case they do attack he dogged the
last clamp into place and moved heavily
through the doorway

the men watching from the gun tur-
rets saw dennis approach the vast pit
which seemed to be the abode of the
sphere the face-plate of his helmet was
open for minutes he stood motionless on
the rim of the pit they knew he was
concentrating duplicating the emotion of
fear then with a catch in their throats
they observed groups of the spheres rise
majestically from the depths and swoop
toward the waiting dennis

  with a swift gesture captain brooke
snapped the face-plate closed the spheres
came to a complete stop about twenty feet
from the waiting captain the globes
pulsed gently as if waiting    waiting

  again dennis opened the face-plate wide
then snapped it shut in the brief interval
the spheres had darted into action sweep-
ing closer

  turning at last captain dennis strode
back to the ship and slowly the flaming
globes sank back into the pit out of sight

  it works scotty yelled delightedly as
the other men ran to their airlock to greet
their captain

  once again at the table dennis began
now we can have a definite plan heres
the strategy two of us will use space-suits
and rocket belts to lure as many of the
spheres as possible to a point near koerbers
camp and one of us must enter koerbers
domain with a ready made story that
man the one to enter koerbers camp will
be the bait for the spheres he will con-
centrate on maintaining the powerful emo-
tion of fear in his mind as strongly as hes
able dennis paused his hazel eyes bril-
liant with anticipation surveying the men
around him

  all of us know that the chosen man
may not come through this alive-koerber
may not believe his story    the spheres
may succeed in getting him however if
hes clever and quick captain dennis
shrugged his great shoulders it was then
jeffery interrupted him
the soul eaters	

  well draw lots for that wont we cap-
tain his voice was harsh

  a faint nod from dennis accepted the
question as a fact the captain walked
over to a cabinet and picked up something
returning to the table he continued

  the fourth man will have to stay here
and broadcast he turned a small box
over on the table and several objects the
size of small coins spilled out these
midget speakers may and may not work-
anyway propaganda at a psychological
moment has intense effect and is worth
trying out the man who goes into koer-
bers camp will take some of these and get
rid of them in strategic places and wher-
ever he can remember the job of broad-
casting is just as important as any other
in this set up keep hammering at them
they wont be able to locate the speakers
until it is too late keep pounding into
their heads that this new weapon of the
i s p is invincible tell them it is radio-
controlled and invulnerable as far as pres-
ent arms are concerned keep working
on them    dont let up for a minute 
jeffery had been methodically tearing
strips of paper and now he handed them
to dennis

  three strips of paper captain    and
four men

  dennis searched the grim tense faces
before him then handed the strips to scotty
who picked up a book and started putting
the strips between the pages the other
members of the council watched his back
curiously until the crash of an overturned
chair snapped their heads around they
looked squarely into the muzzle of an
atom-blast gun their jaws went slack
with astonishment

  i am the commander of this cruiser
captain brookes voice flat and opaque
had an unequivocal finality walk over
to the wall stand five feet from the base
lean forward and press your hands against
the wall 

  with the three men completely off bal-
ance dennis methodically disarmed them
he placed all their weapons on the table
and then proceeded to encase himself in one
of the bulky space-suits keeping a careful
eye on the fuming dallas as he dressed
he continued to talk

  i know that nothing short of this could

-planet stories-fall

convince you to let me be the man to enter
koerbers camp but its got to be this
way i swore to enter that black cruiser
if i had to take it apart and by venus
thinking spiders ill go through with itl
if marlas there she has to be rescued
from that cut-throat gang-besides i think
i can make up a much more plausible story
being as i was the one in disgrace with
the isp not you he was dressed
now and stood for a moment gazing at
their reddened faces im leaving now
ill dog this door when i leave theres
an atomic welder in the locker and you
can get out in three-quarters of an hour
the rest is up to you men he was gone
as the metal door clanged tightly shut

trudging along the iridescent stretch
of desolate ground the thought upper-
most in dennis mind was marla he was
torn between the fear of what that brutal
conscienceless pirate might have done to
her and the fear she might have survived
try as he might to reconstruct the emo-
tion of fear he failed time after time
only the dull ceaseless fury at koerber
remained in his mind and his heart a fury
that smouldered in the depths of his be-
ing

  slowly he approached the camp where
koerbers men tried to repair the damage
his raid had made dennis kept his hands
slightly in the air and his feet kept kick-
ing a scuff of glittering dust that could be
easily noticed

  without warning an atomo-ray blasted
bits of a rocky cliff to captain brookes
right and an invisible voice boomed out

  hold it copper there was a no-
ticeable awe in that voice and it made
dennis smile the scum remembered it
seemed

  dennis stopped abruptly ill talk to
koerber he said coldly

  hold it right where you are captain
koerbers coming outside the same voice
shouted

  cautiously dennis let another of the
midget speakers fall to the ground behind
him

  the circular air-lock opened and a ladder
descended automatically down the steps
came a short heavy-set man his aquiline
features would have been handsome be-
cause of their symmetry and the pale
	planet

olive skin tanned by the vast spaces but
for the perpetual sneer that twisted rather
full lips koerbers wide set eyes were
dark brilliant and just now had a sort
of incredulous amusement as if the spec-
tacle of captain dennis brooke come to
parley with him were something quite too
fantastic to believe

  well    well this is a land of
miracles he flashed a sardonic smile
displaying white even teeth

  considering my reputation for   
er    shall we say dishonor he
smiled again you are risking a great deal
by coming here arent you captain
captain brooke shrugged his vast shoul-
ders and a thin smile of contempt curved
his lips it occurs to me koerber that
at my age men are neither rash nor fools
   unless the stakes are high and
he paused deliberately conscious of the
instant interest his words had aroused
and it happens that the stakes are beyond
 far beyond all that you and i and
even the isp are worth man our feet
are now on the base of a great empire
interest cupidity and astonishment min-
gled in the expression of captain koerbers
face finally he guffawed

  captain they say that too many nights
in the jovian chamber turns a mans mind
i am beginning to believe it then his
face darkened

  lets finish it quick dennis whatre
you selling

  a partnership in an empire in exchange
for marla dennis brooke said quietly
but with deadly emphasis ignoring the
pointed barb

  koerber still gazed at the space-suited
figure incredulously with an imperious
motion of his powerful hand he motioned
captain brooke up the ladder then fol-
lowed at a distance his hand on the atom-
blaster he had not noticed dennis drop
another tiny speaker on the ground be-
hind

inside the black cruiser dennis was
herded by two gunmen into a spacious
cabin it was furnished in the splendor
of priceless loot from the ships of several
planets he felt his atom-blast lifted from
its holster and the indignity of exploratory
fingers seeking hidden arms he walked
past them to see koerber seated in what

stories

had evidently been a martian imperial
chair a throne-like affair of priceless hard-
woods incrusted with rare metals and
jewels and bearing a canopy of soft oce-
landian furs with jewelled brooches at
the corners he sat silent the faint satiri-
cal smile still on his lips as if for once
in his life the very depths of his involved
and merciless soul were filled with joy
as indeed was the case speak your
piece he said insolently and motioned
for the guards to cover the exit

  i shall be brief dennis shrugged his
shoulders marla means more to me than
anything else what can she be to you
than just another passing conquest
theres no satisfaction in possession with-
out love koerber-and there are other
things that you zvould prefer

  for instance the words came like a
whiplash

  wealth beyond even your imagination
and power    power as you have never
even conceived could ever fall into your
hands man

  how do you know marlas alive the
sardonic grin became sadistic in its en-
joyment at the fleeting shadow of pain
that crossed dennis face -

  because dennis spoke slowly quietly
shes too valuable for you to miss the
chance to ransom her you know the

isp never lets its agents down-you
knew shed accepted an assignment didnt
you 

  of course i have scouts in every
planet and means of communication even
you dont know anything about-like that
scout you knocked out on venus he
finished venomously

  well dennis said laconically

  youll have to explain better wheres
the wealth and all this power youre talking
about to come from

  dennis knew he was playing his last
card if the man had even a shred of
humanity of intelligent selfishness the way
was open if koerber allowed his undying
hatred of the isp to dominate him hed
have to fight for his life

  all right ill give it to you this
planetoid is full of a new radio-active
metal of such terrific power that used
even in its raw state it can supply power
for speeds beyond anything known to us
at present the reason you saw our ship
the soul eaters	

before we attacked was that we used a
small specimen of the mineral and it flung
us into space with such terrific acceler-
ation that it almost sent us beyond the
planetoids gravity if my navigators hand
had not fallen on the keys and changed
the course we would have been wrecked
there are untold billions of credits in ra-
dio-active mineral strewn on the surface
now if you cant imagine what that means
   whats the use of my talking

  itll make us invulnerable a few
tons of this new fuel will purchase a fleet
of spacers of the first order such as this
one you have koerber and with a fleet
powered by the mineral we can conquer
any planet power  dennis laughed
man wed lord space

  as dennis spoke the expression of
machiavellian greed and cunning in koer-
bers face heightened mingled by triumph
at last his laughter peal after peal of
cold remorseless laughter thundered in the
luxurious cabin

  you fool you utter fool you have
told me this and expect me to bargain with
you so you would share with me supreme
power over the known universe    one
reason why ive lived so long is that i
never share with anyone and i never
trust anyone copper he flung the final
insult in dennis face and laughed to see
dennis eyes blaze with murderous fury

  throw him in the cell koerber said
imperiously instantly the two gunmen
went into action prodding dennis with
drawn blasters they drove him down
a corridor to a metal cell and heaved him
into it then left him lying on the metal
floor

vi

in the semi-darkness of the armored
cell the wicket through which the guard
could watch the prisoner was a square of
light only there was no guard only
an atomic-welder could have pierced that
tough shell-unarmed within the pirate
cruiser surrounded by armed guards at
every exit dennis hadnt the ghost of a
chance he sat up on the cold metal
floor and strove to point his mind to the
task ahead and the last midget speaker
slipped from his pocket to roll across the
floor coming to a stop at a corner of the

wall dennis could not suppress a smile

  then he heard a voice he had thought
never to hear again a wave of feeling
engulfed him

  dennis    dennis my dear framed
in the wicket the lovely features of marla
smiling despite the brimming eyes smiling
at him in encouragement his heart leapt
upwards as if it would leave his body as
he rose in a single bound and was at the
wicket kissing hungrily the exquisite lips
he could not speak for seconds that
marla was alive was that his heart could
wish for a moment he was weak with
the tremendous reaction youre safe
   safe    not hurt    marla he
was incoherently repeating

  quick marla cautioned take this
she slipped a deadly atom-blast the smaller
variety once carried by women into his
hand they never found it on me-being
a woman i have prerogatives i have been
held for ransom until now and here on
this deserted world having no means of
escape i was allowed comparative freedom
within the ship but i heard what you
told koerber dennis now that he knows
untold wealth is within reach of his hand
he may have another fate in store for me
for the past few days he has been chang-
ing    becoming amorous i know hes
trying to win me dennis  as only a
woman can know

  take this blaster back    and use
it dennis said fiercely

  no need she smiled her eyes lumi-
nous i have a better way ill not be
harmed dennis she kissed him as if
all her heart were in that kiss despite the
vertical bars that divided them then she
was gone leaving behind the faint fra-
grance that she always wore like a scent
in the garden ways or an echo in the wind

  one last card remained to him one
last venture wherein his life would hang
from so stender a thread and yet

  he began to scream and shout with a
passion that raised reverberating echoes
in the enclosing metal cell almost im-
mediately the metal door opened with a
hang and the powerful figure of koerber
flanked by guards with drawn atom-blasts
was silhouetted in the light

  have you gone space-crazy you rat
koerber growled through clenched teeth
whats the racket for
	planet

  you double-crosser  dennis spat like
an animal at bay if i have to be caged
like this after telling you about my dis-
covery at least you could let me have
some air youve got the air rectifiers
shut off in here and its worse than in
the caves want me to choke

  haw one of the guards guffawed
thats real good boss    saves us the
trouble of shooting im

  shut up koerber rumbled double-
crosser eh what made you think id
cut you in on the discovery but youve
given me an idea branche    jen-
nings truss him up and carry him out
to the cave the radioactive mineralsll
take care of him bettern anything else
his sadistic nature gloated on the thought
of dennis gradual disintegration as the
powerful radioactive vibrations bombarded
his being

  koerbers smile was like a feline caress
but his eyes were feral in the ecstasy of
his triple triumph he had marla the
wealth and power of a new universe before
him and his greatest enemy condemned
to a horrible death

  thoroughly trussed they carried den-
nis to the entrance to the cave system
where the radioactive minerals were in
greatest abundance then they threw him
carelessly on the rough rocky ground

  i can watch you from here koerber
said silkily as you slowly rot away well
be working on the spacer for at least four
more hours before we blast off time enough
for the effects of the radiations to begin
to show eh dennis 

  there was no doubt in captain brookes
mind what would happen to marla and to
the isp cruiser when koerber was ready
to leave the monstrous egotism of the
man demanded a series of triumphs for
he already saw himself as a supreme ruler
he watched the guards walk back to the
cruiser where most of the crew were en-
gaged in final repairs and he was glad
fiercely glad so he could concentrate all
the fear he felt for marla all the horror
at the murder of his comrades and the
destruction of his cruiser and the vast
awful vision of a universe ruled by a sad-
istic madman utterly evil began to flood
into his mind as he willed himself to emo-
tionally see these things realized

  suddenly he was aware that through

stories

auto-siiggestion he was beginning to feel
fear real fear he thought of the lumi-
nous spheres    there was something
monstrous about them  the way they
sucked the life-energy from poor randall
he continued to elaborate and build up a
crescendo of horror a blast of thunder
from koerbers ship shook the cave

the distant sun was moving rapidly
toward the horizons rim and the
swift settling twilight enhanced the spumes
coming from the jets of the black pirate
spacer as the rumble of the warming
rockets died to a murmur dennis saw two
guards leave the airlock of the pirate
cruiser they were jennings and branche
they must be almost ready to leave he
thought the guards came to where he lay
and roughly jerked him to his feet then
dragged him further inside the cave where
the deadly radioactives would really get to
work on his body then they dropped
him unceremoniously as they turned with
a start

   like black magic a stentorian voice had
begun speaking filling the melancholy dusk
of the eerie planetoid as the thundering
tones seemed to come from everywhere
ear-drums throbbing with the vibration
the guards jerked dennis back to the cave
entrance the binding cords that tied den-
nis becoming dangerously ragged with the
dragging over the rough ground he had
endured twice

  bren koerber attention this is
the isp the voice rolled and echoed
youre completely surrounded resistance
will be futile you have just one minute
to get your men together in front of your
ship throw your side-arms in a pile on
the ground

  koerber appeared at the lock of the
pirate spacer then he scrambled down with
surprising agility followed by three of his
men

  who in hell is playing jokes the
pirate roared come on he yelled at
the two guards now at the caves entrance
you    branche    jennings whos
getting funny somebodys going to get
their heads blasted off for this

  but instantly on the heels of koerbers
tirade came scottys voice magnified a
hundred times

  your times almost up koerber fif-
the soul eaters



teen seconds more and the newest most
deadly weapon of the isp will be re-
leased against you

  even though he was still concentrating
on the spheres and the emotion of fear
dennis felt a sudden exaltation but he
brushed it aside and continued to recreate
the terrible fear that had begun to invade
his being under his relentless auto-hypno-
sis subconsciously he could hear scottys
sonorous voice describing the horrible irre-
sistible weapon that was to be used scotty
was doing a magnificent job of laying it on
with variations 

  koerber gazed around in stupefaction
then spying the prone figure at the mouth
of the cave he cursed at dennis and then
began to race across to the trussed up figure
of his enemy but he was halted by a hoarse
shout from one of his guards

  boss look there is something com-
ing the guard yelled excitedly

  still lying on the ground where the
guards had dropped him dennis could
barely see the top of the cliff behind him
over the edge high above the plain swept
cluster after cluster of the glowing glori-
ously shimmering spheres a myriad rain
of lavender greens pulsing reds and flam-
boyant blues iridescent flaming with in-
ward fires and spinning ever faster the
spectral globes swept downwards in the
deepening twilight with dazzling speed

  get the gun working you scum  koer-
ber cursed pointing to the portable atomo-
ray still remaining outside the spacer two
men jumped at his order and the livid
ray blasted skyward blasting fiercely for
a few seconds the two outlaws hesitated
astonishment then fear crossed their stub-
bled faces the deadly ray was merely
expanding the globes which flared into
incandescent light and kept right on com-
ing down

  huge chunks out of the side of the cliff
behind the zooming spheres crashed to the
plain and still the glittering flood of
glowing globes kept flowing on his men
must have done a wonderful job of luring
the deadly spheres dennis thought with a
part of his mind

  needle guns koerber screamed rush-
ing over to the two men who stopped firing
use your hand guns men someone get
atomite capsules well blast whatever these
things are out of space

  picking up the heavy atomo-ray koerber
cradled it in his powerful arms sweeping
the deadly projector in wide arcs through
the approaching luminous mass sud-
denly koerber shouted again one of the
men near the stern of the ship had dropped
his weapon and was running horror-
stricken across the broken ground

  come back here you rat koerber
shrieked swinging the big atomo-ray
around but he had no need to fire a
glowing globe fully six feet in diameter
already was pursuing the doomed fear-
maddened creature with vertiginous speed
koerber saw it suddenly descend and en-
velop the running figure and in seconds
the outlaw was a shrunken mass that
dropped to the ground like a squeezed
fruit

  koerbers eyes were blazing as he whirled
around and screamed at his men fight
   fight you lousy rats uncontrollable
passion twisted his features in a fiendish
snarl at the thought of losing the supreme
power and unimaginable wealth he had
thought to be within his grasp his voice
rose piercingly above the concussions of
the atomite capsules that at his command
had been brought into action

  but unknown to him stealthily a grow-
ing fear was creeping into his brain as all
his efforts and the deadly fire of atom-
blasts atomo-ray and atomite capsules
failed to even destroy a single globe the
unearthly macabre appearance of the lumi-
nous globes was already playing havoc
with the mens minds and one by one the
outlaws fled shrieking into the darkness
to be consumed by the glowing spheres

in the impenetrable blackness of the
cave dennis brooke had stopped build-
ing the emotion of fear with part of his
mind he sought to dispel the stubborn auto-
hypnosis and slowly he was able to re-
gain a measure of normalcy the thought
of marla helped as with the growing de-
struction of koerbers men he deliberately
forced himself to see her safe in his arms
and slowly he came back out of the abyss
of fear into which he had purposely pushed
his courageous mind it took patience
infinite patience and time but time was
growing short he rubbed the frayed
bonds that bound his arms back of him
against the jagged outcroppings of radio-


planet stories

active rock until he burst them with her-
culean strength then it took a matter of
seconds to free his legs painfully he
stood up and let the blood course with ex-
quisite torture through his semi-paralyzed
limbs then he sought the tiny atom-blast
marla had given him to conceal

  the space in front of the black spacer
was milling with men battling spheres a
vortex of flaring illumination that hungrily
enveloped the maddened crew now and
then another man sank to the ground a
lifeless hulk suddenly one of the spheres
came floating into the cave curious at-
tracted by the remnants of the fear vibra-
tions and approached dennis the cap-
tain saw it enter and illuminate the im-
penetrable darkness he laughed a few
moments ago it would have meant his life
but now he contemptuously bent down and
picking a glittering specimen of radioactive
mineral flung it unerringly at the gently
spinning globe as if the sphere werent
even there the i s p captain strode out
of the cave it was then he saw his own
crew space-suited exultant spewing green
death from their atom-blasts at the milling
remnants of what had been the scourge of
the space-lanes far to one side he spied
koerber now a demoniac figure still firing
the few remaining charges left in the
atomo-ray saw him finally drop the use-
less weapon and turn to fend off the swoop-
ing spheres in a few bounds dennis was
beside him

  at the sight of dennis the scowling face
went black with fury he sprang forward
with both arms jabbing like pistons dennis
swerved and again planted a terrific left
to koerbers solar-plexus it almost doubled
the pirate over but koerber was not
through he knew death was very close
but he meant to take with him the one
man he blamed for his defeat he came
in with a fury that swept all before him
impervious of the rain of blows that dennis
aimed at his face and unleashing a right
to dennis jaw he put every ounce of re-
maining power behind it but the i s p
captain moved slightly letting the blow
whiz past his face then flat-footed he
let his right ride with the power of a
sledge-hammer koerbers face lost con-
tour a gout of dark welling blood flooded
over it and he sank to the ground

  suddenly dennis own men saw him and
came running to where he stood planted
over what remained of koerber pirate of
the space lanes his chest heaving clothes
torn he heard them as if in a dream as
they shouted in joy at the complete victory
they had achieved it was only when cool
hands touched his face and a remembered
fragrance was in his nostrils that he came
out of his daze a voice was whispering
the simple words my dear    my very
dear slowly he gathered marla in his
arms and kissed her tenderly while around
him the hovering spheres sensed another
emotion greater even than fear-but of
another kind-that greatest of all emo-
tions love

captain dennis chewed the end
of his stylus after a moment he
began to write again in the large metallic
book

 b-xa-
  sct

  the plan outlined in the previous entry
was carried out operation successful

tenant george randall killed in perfor-
mance of duty by one of the spheres

humous honors suggest antares cross

  dennis brooke paused for a moment un-
certain whether or not to enter in the
official log book the one burning desire
that dominated his thoughts at last he
smiled and with a flourish he added

  leave of absence for two months re-
quested reason marriage miss marla
starlatid has consented to honor me by be-
coming my wife

  distantly he heard the muffled roar of
the warming rockets the great cruiser
was ready to leave the fateful planetoid
he sighed in vast contentment as he un-
plugged the stylus and gently closed the
book
men without a world

by joseph farrell

the centaurians were making one last effort to conquer earth
and their tools were wise-cracking space-jaunting odea and
hawthorne-two guys to whom freedom was more than a word

illustration by kiemle

he frantic flares of the rockets
lit up a murderous landscape as bar-
rel-chested paul hawthorne wres-
tled with the controls he fought to keep
the ship from falling too swiftly anxious
eyes searching for a level spot to set down
the partly-crippled vessel

  behind him lance odea clung to a
chart table and growled

  put it down odea ordered youre
the einstein who got us to this desert
planet of centauri now get us landed
safely 

  hawthorne risked a second to turn his
grimy face to the animated bean pole be-
hind him like himself odea was un-
shaven and wrapped in the shapeless cover-
alls of spacemen hawthorne scowled and
pushed his hairy arms back into the con-
trols

  if you think you can do any better
he grunted take over yourself

  no thanks odea bent over to look
through the port the jagged terrain was
closer and a horrified shudder ran down
his bony frame no ill let you answer
to saint peter for the death of us both

  his expression as he glared at haw-
thorne was distasteful but the makings of
a grin played on the corners of his lips
and a thinly-hid concern was in his eyes

  this is the end he said in one hand
he clutched a photograph of a dark-haired
girl the end mercedes  to think
youll be a widow before youre even a
wife all because that ape of a hawthorne
lost all our fuel in centauris asteroid
belt-

  shut up the pilot demanded one
of his hands flipped a wad of something
green back in odeas direction heres
the ten platins i owe you and get ready
-this is it

a roughly level spot swept up at them

-an uneven mesa that ended abruptly a
few hundred feet ahead hawthorne
dropped the vessel in a cushion of rocket
blasts that were starting to cough for lack
of fuel

  the ship bellied along the mesa dipped
into a pocket odea crashed into the
stocky pilot as the ship turned end over
end then both struck the control board
smashing fifty thousand platins worth of
instruments as they bounced around the
ship hesitated for a second at the edge of
the mesa balanced neatly and decided to
stay there

inside the ship the lights were gone
for a few seconds there was a crash-
ing of furniture then silence

lance hawthornes voice trembled
slightly are you killed i h-hope-
but the catch in his throat indicated he
meant differently from the darkness
came odeas answering drawl

  no you ape-i was just hoping the
same about you how about some light
hawthorne fumbled around found a
battery-operated light that had survived
the crash he hobbled to where odea
was half buried in a heap of furniture and
extricated him the two of them rubbed
their sore spots and looked glumly about

  centauri six hawthorne mused
you have the book larnin whats this
planet like

  odea pressed fingers to his temples
not inhabited by centaurs he said
which is one small break at least we
wont have those monsters-

  i asked about the planet

  if any centaurs show up said odea
shortly itll make no difference about the
planet the space guide gives it the name
avignon hardly known by humans of
course-like the rest of this system it


	planet

has no water and no air well die of
thirst or suffocation here but at least the
centaurs wont get us

  hawthorne looked up from the aneroid
set beside the airlock

  as usual he said youre wrong we
have an atmospheric pressure of ten
pounds and whats more the instruments
show its a real atmosphere-like earths
theres no such planet your instru-
ments must be damaged

  no hawthorne shook his head
these instruments dont lie and they
say we have an atmosphere it may be
thicker in the valleys

  then odea insisted the space
guide must be wrong because my memory
distinctly tells me-

  be damned to your memory i brought
this ship down and i felt the atmosphere
whats more all the planets inside the
asteroid belt except this one are in-
habited by centaurs-and were certainly
inside the asteroid belt

  you should know odea glared at
him after letting that asteroid smash
through our fuel tanks-

  you make me tired hawthorne
yawned were getting on each others
nerves better get some sleep and cool
off

  he cleared a place on the floor and re-
laxed while odea watched fists knot-
ted the burly pilot started to snore

  odea grinned suddenly and turned
away he stared thoughtfully out the
port it was dark a feeble distant sun
was falling below a rugged horizon and
in the sky above he picked out ruddy
proxima

  but there should be a real sun due to
rise soon nice thing about centauri-
there were enough suns to suit anybody

  his eyes fell on the wad of bills haw-
thorne had thrown at him he retrieved
it happily also finding the photograph he
gazed fondly at the deep dark eyes and
rich lips of the girl kissed the picture
happily

  good night mercedes he said well
show him in the morning

brilliant sunlight flooded the cabin
when they awoke at this distance
the sun seemed somewhat smaller than
sol as seen from earth but it was bril-

stories

liant and warm they ate a fast concen-
trated breakfast and studied the airlock
hawthorne voiced his verdict

  we can repair it in a few hours get
the tools out

  odea was looking at the gravity indi-
cator

  gravity is  he announced thats
the correct figure for avignon-no ques-
tion about it but i cant understand that
atmosphere it doesnt belong

  he took the torch hawthorne shoved at
him and they went to work on the airlock
when they had unjammed the inner door
they found that the outer had somehow
escaped injury

  they crawled into the lock an almost
vertical climb with the ship tilted as it
was and closed the inner door behind
them odea shoved open the outer and
pushed his nose over the edge of the ship
his eyes bulged

  gulp he said pointing

  hawthornes head appeared beside
odeas and the two stared at the canon
floor a thousand feet below their space
ship was partly hanging over the edge of
the mesa

  and i slept last night odea mar-
veled

  he swiveled his head in the other di-
rection

  gulp he said again

  three centaurs dominant beings of the
alpha centauri system faced them with
drawn guns the grinning creatures were
vaguely manlike-they walked on two legs
and breathed oxygen at that point the
resemblance ceased for they also breathed
methane or ammonia or practically noth-
ing at all they also had big eyes a
dozen arms and more fingers than a
moron could count without risking a head-
ache

  odea closed his eyes and moaned

  this is it mercedes he said softly

  shut up hawthorne muttered may-
be theyre an independent tribe- he
twisted his homely face into a grin and
spoke in south martian vlandian the
lingua franca of space

  sonin amiki    neura bare s arik-

  oh how lovely said the largest cen-
taur in english such a delightful ship
and what wonderful specimens of homo
sapiens wre are find this auspicious oc-

	planet

currence will aid our plans in the utmost
manner

   the creature assumed an expression that
passed for a friendly smile among the
centaurs this consisted of displaying all
his teeth and snapping them together as
he spoke

  i am called morguma he announced
in bridgeport connecticut i learn the
english before comes the war-so sorry
the trouble he smirked apologetically
it is with the most pleased pleasure i
acquaint myself with you

  odea heard hawthornes voice low in
his ear now were in for it hes no
independent tribesman

  the lanky spaceman shrank back from
the centaur eyeing the gleaming molars
suspiciously he was remembering that
the human race was at war with these be-
ings though there had been practically no
fighting for ten years since the time the
centaurs in the solar system were ex-
changed for human hostages held by the
enemy

  while man was learning the rules of
space flight these creatures had been build-
ing their first spaceships strange con-
test though neither human nor centaur
suspected the existence of the other each
progressed about as rapidly as if linked
by cosmic telepathy each race colonized
its own system and gradually built up
speeds great enough for interstellar travel
indeed the first human ship had just left
for centauri when the first vessel of the
centaurs landed on mars

   for a time it seemed that a beneficial
union of two races had been established
then it was discovered that the aliens had
moral standards so different from humans
that life with them was impossible though
small groups of them visiting earth or the
planets were well-behaved and gracious
guests they were likely when they out-
numbered their hosts to turn their thoughts
to vivisection  or to casual massacre if
they decided that humans annoyed them

  so outraged humanity had declared war
driven the visitors from the system but
at that point the war virtually ended it
was impossible for either earth or cen-
tauri to send a serious invasion fleet into
the others home system because of the
tremendous distance in either case the

stories

defenders would have an advantage that
could not be overcome

lance odea felt perspiration trick-
ling down his face he studied the
happy aliens

  morguma waved his weapon you
will please to come out our beloved broth-
ers of earth it will create difficulty to
remove your ship to a more auspicious
location if you do not remove yourselves
from it first

  the two men descended from the lock
above them a centaur ship hovered
darted out pale green seizure beams in
the grip of the beams the earth ship slid
back from the mesa edge to more secure
ground

  behind morguma more centaurs were
coming up their features masked with
broad happy grins the centaur leader
stepped aside motioned the men to precede
him

  flanked by the armed guards they
marched across the mesa reached a broad
trail that led into a valley below odea
stopped short in surprise

  he stared into the broad valley

  is it not inspiring morguma en-
thused behind him our beautiful rocket
center that we created on this formerly
barren world oh it makes my heart sing
with joy

  the two men eyes wide looked down
at the teeming centaur life that filled the
immense valley great factories sprawled
for miles apparently engaged in manu-
facturing and servicing space ships thou-
sands of craft were berthed in neat rows
for as far as they could see from small
one passenger jobs to deadly battle cruis-
ers they were taking off and landing by
the hundreds

  there arent that many ships in the
universe odea mumbled dazed and
millions of centaurs of all the places
we could have landed-

he felt a polite prodding in his spine
please to walk our charming brothers
of earth came morgumas voice it is
with pleasure i will explain to you when
we reach our destination

  their destination was a sprawling build-
ing set in the noise center of the rocket
base they were marched into a room
where a gigantic centaur sat shouting or-
me jv without a world	

ders to lesser ones among the centaurs
size was synonymous with rank in this
civilization so alien to human thought the
largest creature was king though he should
be only an idiot mentally

  odea listened bored while morguma
explained in his native language to his
chief the leader stared in surprise at the
two humans then his mood suddenly be-
came ecstatic he spoke swiftly to mor-
guma who turned to the men

  oh you fortunate people it is your
remarkable luck to be the first humans to
inhabit this planet we create for our
brothers of the solar system

  whats this all about hawthorne
growled

morguma waved several arms and
translated the remarks of his chief
we were so devastated to have a mis-
understanding with your wonderful peo-
ple we are so sorry not to associate with
you that we are preparing this planet for
human beings to inhabit

  odea and hawthorne stared at each
other

  like you people of earth morguma
went on we too have an asteroid belt in
our system and in our asteroids are in-
cluded many delightful pieces of frozen
oxygen nitrogen water and other ravish-
ingly beautiful elements that gladden the
heart of a human we are bringing these
life-giving substances to this planet
avignon i

  i told you said odea my mem-
ory didnt fail me paul maybe these two-
legged crocodiles arent so bad after all-
creating a planet for us-

  when this pleasant operation is con-
cluded said morguma we will bring
humans to this planet they will have chil-
dren whom we shall take from their par-
ents and educate in the proper manner-
what hawthornes fists knotted he
moved a step in morgumas direction
stopped when he faced a line of drawn
guns morguma continued

  oh it will be such rapturous delight to
instruct these little innocents in such tasks
as espionage work on earth and killing of
those misguided humans who continue to
fight us- 

  morgumas eyes rolled piously-and

chuckled he displayed his teeth in a
friendly smile

  and you two-oh you favorite sons of
fortune we shall allow you to help us
in this gesture of interstellar good will
in your ship you may aid in securing the
necessary elements from our asteroid
belt

  in our ship- odea looked hopeful
oh sure well be glad to help well go
out right after its patched up and loaded
with fuel-

  of course gurgled morguma i
should be overjoyed to enjoy your charm-
ing company therefore i shall accompany
you also it is not necessary to give you
more than enough fuel to reach the as-
teroid belt and come back here

  i knew there was a catch odea
grumbled what do we do now paul
you can do anything you please
hawthorne snapped ive had enough
the heavy framed spaceman hurled
himself at the grinning centaur a frac-
tion of a second later odea followed suit
before they could cross the few feet that
separated morguma from them the shock
guns of the guards barked the two men
sprawled forward unconscious at the feet
of the still grinning alien

  oh how sad morguma cried how
unfortunate we must revive these beau-
tiful persons i am sure they will see our
point of view

ii

odea and hawthorne watched their
repaired vessel roll out of the cen-
taur repair shop the smashed plates had
been neatly straightened the vessel
gleamed from nose to tail

  an enthusiastic centaur foreman ac-
companied the ship

  oh my intimate friends he sprayed
in hawthornes face i too parles-vous
the english for men i have the great
love it will give me tremendous enjoy-
ment to help to populate this planet with
human beings

  you go to hell hawthorne growled
he shivered in avignons thin atmosphere
and pulled the rough blanket morguma
had supplied tighter around him he and
odea looked like a pair of indian chiefs

  undertake to observe said the fore-
man seizure beams
	planet

  he shouted something in his own lan-
guage to his workers inside the ship the
pale green beams lanced out the fore-
mans fangs protruded several inches

  and the interior is so dainty the
creature warbled chenille curtains over
the ports pastel wallflower paper fur-
nishings of a luxuriance that would be of
pleasure even to the dictator himself
hawthorne spat disgustedly pastel
wallpaper chenille curtains who ever
heard of curtains in a space ship much
less chenille

  his homely face twisted in pain che-
nille  he groaned again

  you have no soul grinned odea
as long as these baboons are willing to
supply us with the finer things of life
you might at least appreciate it

  you know what i think of you
growled hawthorne chenille curtains-
ugh

  he spat disgustedly

  morguma appeared and waved them to
the open lock he preceded them and
when they had mounted to the lock he
shoved them back gently with his huge
paws until they faced a barrage of centaur
camera fiends the three of them mor-
guma in the middle with a giant smirking
grin stood framed in the lock while shut-
ters clicked

  i wish you wouldnt breathe in my
face odea said you smell like some-
thing that forgot to die off in the meso-
zoic era

  morguma giggled all centauri loves
you your beautiful faces will be in all
our newspapers now

  they went into the control room haw-
thorne stared unbelievingly at the trans-
formation flowers were spread pro-
fusely embroidered antimacassars graced
the dainty chairs and the curtains over
the ports were indeed of chenille the
pilot groaned dismally

  but odeas eyes lighted when he saw
the huge portrait over the control board
mercedes he shouted

 oh how happy i am to see you
pleased exclaimed morguma we found
this divine female human beings picture
and enlarged it as you see she is an en-
trancing thing

  you talk the truth odea agreed

stories

but that wont change the fact that i
dont like you what happens now
morguma looked mildly apologetic
now we must perform labor the great
task for which this ship has been fitted
the centaur seated himself at the rear
of the control room produced an instru-
ment that looked like a whip it looked
like a whip because it was one he flicked
it experimentally

  oh how devastated i would be he
told them if i should be forced to use
this you will take off and fly to our as-
teroid -belt following the intelligent direc-
tions i shall give you we will find a sub-
stantial piece of some agreeable material
and bring it back to avignon

  the two men looked at each other and
then at the whip the alien snapped it
lightly a few times as if nervous they
turned to the control board

a few hours later they were in
alpha centauris asteroid belt dodg-
ing debris for a while they were nervous
it was here in this field of small flying
particles that was worse even than their
solar systems that a baseball-sized rock
had eluded their detectors and knifed
through their vessel passing through all
three fuel chambers in its line of flight
and taking a long stream of rocket fuel
for its wake

  but the centaurs evidently had per-
fected asteroid navigation and when they
saw several pieces of matter that were
about to strike them deflected they
stopped worrying

  odea manned a board lined with in-
struments the centaurs had installed
they were simple to operate he merely
moved a telescope lens until a piece of
cosmic scrap was in the cross hair then
he read a dial the telescope was synchro-
nized with a centaur version of a spec-
troscope and its reading was given in
figures on the dial

  he felt the centaur looking over his
shoulder checking up on him so he had
to do his work properly not that it
made much difference whether he and
hawthorne played the game was of little
importance as far as the centaurs plans
went except that the creatures liked the
symbolism created by having- two humans
work on the project
mev without a world	

  morguma he said those space-
ships on avignon cant all be engaged in
this work there are types there that can
be of no use

  oh you are so intelligent to reason
that morguma marveled this pretty
planet of avignon is the reservation we
have set aside for all space work all of
our ships are built there and all are based
there

  odea tracked down a likely looking
asteroid

  how come he asked

  we centaurs are a delicate sensitive
people we love the beautiful things of
life and dislike such noisy greasy articles
as space ships so a few years ago it was
decided to remove all the dirty factories
from our home planets now the only
craft that disturb the peace of our people
on the main planets of centauri are the
rockets that transport materials and work-
ers to and from avignon

  thereis something wrong there
odea centered his instrument on the as-
teroid you seem to- be happy enough
and the other workers on avignon-they
didnt seem to be disgusted by the dirt and
noise

  oh i am ecstatic morguma raved
it is my aptitude rocket fuel is my life
blood there are those among us who
have a love for this noisy distasteful life
of space

  sounds logical odea murmured
some humans enjoy doing the dirty work
that nauseates the average person   
unpleasant but necessary as for that re-
mark about rocket fuels being your life
bloom morguma i happen to know its
true

  he chuckled at the look of discomfiture
that spread over morgumas features the
quintal that was a part of rocket fuel
was the equivalent of alcohol to the me-
tabolism of the centaurs several times
he had seen morguma take a quick pull
from a small bottle he kept in his leathery
garment-the centaur version of a hip
flask

 morguma changed the subject as
odeas throaty chuckle continued he
pointed to the grayish speck in the tele-
scope

  oh a remarkable find a lump of
solid carbon dioxide and of such a size

oh how fortunate we are to have such
fortunate fortune

  their vessel closed in on the chunk of
almost pure carbon dioxide a piece larger
than the ship under the centaurs direc-
tions odea fed out the seizure beams
he watched the rough mass become grad-
ually rigid fixed in space relative to them

  that seizure beam would interest
earths scientists but earth was tril-
lions of miles away

  morguma clapped his paws together in
foolish delight oh how goody we must
hasten back to avignon on the way we
will analyze this precious find

as they blasted tback toward cen-
tauris sixth planet odea learned
from morguma how the analysis was made
by instrument the figures they reported
would be turned into a central office along
with the results of other ships engaged in
the same task in that way the centaurs
checked the composition of the atmos-
phere they were creating for the planet
knew what elements were most necessary
at any given moment

  they swooped low over the planet on
the side opposite the space base other
centaurs were bringing laden ships down
loosing their cargoes like sticks of bombs
a great plateau was speckled with white
and below the ocean bed was filling with
water

  hawthorne joined the procession of
centaur ships when they neared the sur-
face he barked at odea to loosen their
load the seizure beams disappeared and
the icy chunk splashed over several acres
of ground

  a successful mission morguma gig-
gled now we return to our lovely base
to rest

  odea and hawthorne glowered

  the next day was similar to the first
and the one after it and all the rest until
they had turned in a dozen days of work
as slaves in the asteroid belt odea be-
came proficient in operating his instru-
ments  and hawthorne brushed up on pre-
cision bombing until he could have planted
his loads on a dime if anybody had pro-
vided the dime

  they found out that the centaurs didnt
believe in resting on the sabbath working
hours were roughly from sunup to sun-
	planet

down-about an eight hour stretch since
avignons day was shorter than earths

  at dawn a skipping troop of young
centaurs invaded their chambers the
students were learning english diplomatic
french south martian portuguese and
a score of other languages of which haw-
thorne and odea knew nothing

  then morguma came and led them to a
huge boiler factory that was fitted as a
dining room where they toyed with cen-
taur food and ate vita-horm capsules sal-
vaged from their ship

  after that it was out to the asteroid
belt for another load of frozen atmos-
phere

  oh hell said odea they were
going back to their quarters after another
days work if it wasnt for that picture
of mercedes id throw in my buttons
im dying to see a human being again
hawthornes homely face turned sus-
piciously to him im here aint i
odea raised an eyebrow and turned
away a fleet of powerful centaur dread-
naughts was landing they had just per-
formed the fabulous task of transporting
a huge frozen lake to avignon-a miracle
of coordination

  odea filled his lungs with air he re-
moved the blanket from his shoulders let
his chest rise and fall evenly

  almost as good as earth he said
this air is wonderful now but its wasted
only two humans to breathe it-hey

  he stared at the spindly mountain that
rose to a dizzy peak at the far end of the
valley a thin stream of smoke rose from
it

  i never noticed that before morguma
-is that a -volcano

  morguma who had paused to watch
them enjoy the air looked toward the
steaming mountain top and uncovered his
fangs in a friendly smile

  entirely without harm my charming
friends of earth our great scientists
have performed in full an investigation
there is absolutely no danger from that
volcano

  odea peered suspiciously at the distant
cone if thaj thing ever goes off this
valley will be buried

oh fear not that this luscious land will
be demolished my beautiful comrades

stories

not a hair of your lovely heads will be

harmed

  hawthorne growled odea made a fist
of his right hand rubbed it thoughtfully
but he shrugged looking at the centaurs
twelve arms they continued into the
noisy dining room

  as they entered hawthorne stopped
short and glared suddenly shaking with
anger he waved his fist at morguma

  this is the limit you can kill me
but i dont have to stand for-this

his gesture swept the huge room
on every chair was hung bouquets
of riotously colored centaurian flowers
the walls were padded with garlands and
huge vases were in the center of each
table from the ceiling more streamers
of blossoms dipped low

  odeas lips twitched trying to hold
back a grin he watched the solid plain
features of the husky pilot become dark
with fury

  wait paul he said quickly until we
find out what its all about he turned
to morguma what happens here my
reptilian amigof

  a holiday tomorrow is the birth-
day of his supreme magnificence the
centaur on the anniversary of his com-
ing into the world as the son of a humble
fish cleaner we honor this great person
by desisting from all labor

  oh-the big shots birthday odea
held a hand on hawthornes arm as the
pilot started to cool off he stared at the
huge portrait of a giant moronic centaur
leering unintelligently down at them

  a few little glands controlling a whole
solar system he mused im glad that
rhino never leaves his palace

  he turned his eyes from the dictators
portrait took hawthornes arm and
guided him away the two men walked to
their customary places when they found
their chairs hawthorne stopped and
growled again he stared distastefully at
the decorations on their chairs

  they were flowers-flowers from earth

  and they were pansies

  hawthorne pushed them disgustedly
from the arms of his chair and settled
down in glum resignation

  morguma took his place at odeas left
odea glanced at hawthorne on his right
men without a world



and chuckled he turned to the centaur
terrestrial flowers how come

  i ecstasize to see your pleasure mor-
guma drooled one of our brave cap-
tains took a ship to your delightful world
succeeded in plucking fragrant specimens
of fauna and flora to populate this world
there are now animals and vegetation
from earth thriving happily on this globe 
so    any humans

  a tear trickled down morgumas leath-
ery cheek oh it was so sadl the hu-
mans resisted-poor misguided creatures
they all lost their valuable lives and we
will have to return for more

  odea put down the centaurian mush-
room he had been preparing to taste the
grin disappeared from his face as he
shoved back his chair and faced morguma
there was a deadly something in his eyes
that seemed out of place in the usually
carefree features

  another of your nonchalant slaugh-
ters his voice was a low monotone
morguma youll pay for that-you and
your grinning murder pals-

  his hand closed around the steaming
cup of centaurian coffee and he flung the
liquid into the centaurs face

ill

an hour later he sat on his bed and
rubbed his aching jaw he peered
through a puffed eye at hawthorne beside
him the pilots blunt face was all grin

  so im the primitive savage haw-
thorne doubled in laughter youre the
one who acted intelligent like a guinea pig
tonight

  laugh you ape odea groaned and
moved his jaw tenderly not broken i
guess but morguma sure packs quintol
in those cornerstones he uses for fists all
twelve of them

  quintol-thats it hawthorne pulled
a bottle from under his shirt he looked
patronizingly at odea theres enough
quintol here to get four centaurs blind
drunk

  well start slopping it up slop
this bottle said hawthorne patiently
is our dictators birthday present to our
friend morguma the centaurs will ap-
preciate such a gesture of friendship

  odea stared through unbelieving black
eyes at him why you-rat-

  tomorrow hawthorne went on is
a holiday nobody works except us
thats as a token of interstellar good will
we work and the centaurs rest-except
our good friend morguma who will be
along to keep an eye on us morguma
deserves a little fun too

  odea crawled out of his bunk and ad-
vanced with hard fists he was promptly
shoved back by the grinning hawthorne

  dont you see  hawthorne demanded
we get morguma so pie-eyed he wont
know whats going on then-

  he drew a stubby forefinger across his
throat and made a croaking noise odea
pried his puffed eyelids apart and beamed
in pleased understanding his lips parted
slowly in a grin that would have done
credit to a centaur

  oh i am ecstatic he said

morguma was ecstatic when he re-
ceived his present tears of happi-
ness gushed down his cheeks as odea
presented the vacuum bottle with a flowery
oration he seemed to have forgotten the
incident of the previous night and took
no notice of odeas bruised features

  the happy creature crushed odea to
his bosom with several bear-like arms

  oh my dear bosom friends my heart
would swell with song if i were able to
sing oh you fortunate humans to be
able to sing

  odea broke loose from the embrace
and rubbed his ribs he looked cheerfully
at hawthorne

  as soon as hes non compos mentis
he whispered well slug the lug and-
shut up hawthorne growled softly
youll queer everything

  the pilot took his place at the control
board and they pushed out to the asteroid
belt morguma settled himself in his usual
chair at the rear of the control room and
tantalized himself by smelling the quintol

  oh how wonderful he enthused
aged in the bottle too how i love
humans

  odea glanced impatiently from the cor-
ner of his eye the centaur was in no
hurry to consume the quintol they were
approaching the asteroid belt before he had
put much inside him
	planet

  the two men stalled by chasing down
worthless rocks until half the liquor was
inside the centaur morgumas six eyes
gradually became glassier and glassier he
started to sway a little in -his chair

  gonna get the mosh wonnerful piesh
of dlightful oshy-oshygen you ever
shaw he announced theresh stu-
pendous piesh oh i am rap-rapshurous 
its only a piece of pumice odea
insisted

    itsh oshygen lovely beautful de-
lecbub-delectble oshygen morguma
staggered toward them put sheizure
beam on lovely oshygen

  the seizures clamped on the stone as
odea shrugged and threw out the beams
morguma took another long nip and let
his eyes swim into focus on the dials he
looked hurt

  not oshygen not lovely oshygen
oh i am eshcruchiated

  the creature sobbed and took another
drink he staggered back and fell into
his chair where he fell into a weeping
spree his head buried in his hands

  odea glanced swiftly his elbow dug
into hawthornes ribs

  hawthorne nodded they quietly picked
up the wrenches they had kept nearby
started toward morguma

   one on each side they moved cautiously
silently they moved forward until they
came within striking distance

hawthorne waved odea back gestur-
ing to his own powerful right arm odea
nodded poised his weapon for the follow
up swing hawthorne raised the wrench
and then morgumas whip flicked out

hawthornes eyes remained fas-
tened to his empty hand as the
wrench clattered into a comer again the
snap of centaur leather and odeas wea-
pon joined the other the two men stood
foolishly like a pair of boys caught steal-
ing apples morguma spoke

  oh you bad bad people go back to
control board let poor morguma alone
oh i am deshicated to think you would do
thish to poor old frien morguma

  they slunk back to their posts odea
raised his helpless eyes to the portrait
above the controls

  what can i do mercedes he whis-

stories

pered the guy is stiffer than king tut
and still you cant beat him

  they avoided each others eyes each
knew what the other was thinking de-
feat meant that the centaur had won
there would be no warning to earth

  avignon would become a planet of slave
humans blindly following the skillful
teachings of the centaurs they would
infiltrate earth tear down from within
   generations would be required but
the centaurs had time they thought in
long term strategy

  hawthorne was staring unbelievingly
through the telescope his trembling fin-
gers closed on odeas arm

  let go you ape-

  odea stopped impelled by the smolder-
ing hope in the eyes that warned him to
silence he glanced swiftly to be sure that
morguma was still hunched stupidly in his
chair then followed hawthornes gaze
he gasped at what they saw

  in their line of vision was a mass that
looked like twisted wire coiled up in a
planless tangle odea leaned forward
stared without belief

  our fuel he breathed if we can
get hold of that-

  hawthorne waved him frantically si-
lently to the seizure beams odea tip-
toed to- the levers waited with one eye on
morguma while hawthorne crept up on
the precious fuel

  odea eyed the dials hands shaking on
the control bars there was no mistake
it was indeed their fuel forced out of the
hole in their tanks by internal pressure
pressed out into space in a priceless rib-
bon it had frozen into this amorphous
mass

  odeas heart was heavy in his ears
his suddenly feverish eyes darted to the
apparently-sleeping morguma then to the
smiling portrait of mercedes

  hawthorne nodded imperatively the
ship jolted slightly as the seizure beams
went on the fuel was clamped rigid be-
fore them morguma stirred and studied
them with glazed eyes his thick voice
croaked

  whazzhat oshygen lovely precious
oshygen 

  thats right morguma oshygen-i
mean oxygen odea brought the chunk
closer trying hard to look natural it
men without a world	

looks so lovely id like to take a chunk on
board and sniff it right now

  oh whassa lovely ideas morguma
still clutching his whip and his bottle navi-
gated by dead-drunk reckoning to the vi-
sion plate in the control rooms belly he
peered stupidly at the coiled fuel odea
feared that the sound of his breathing
would sober the centaur he held the
breath in his pounding lungs

  s funny oshygen morguma mum-
bled mosh funniesh oshygen i ever
seen he brightened mush be a rare
ishotype oh mush be lovliesh oshygen
in whole galaxy

  he closed all but one eye and tried to
read the dials furtively odea turned
the telescope into the asteroid belt and the
instruments swayed as badly as morguma
himself the centaur shuddered and
turned away

  broken  all the metersh mush be
drunk cant eshamine lovely oshygen
he started sobbing

  oh come now old man said odea
sympathetically we can bring a piece
of it inside the ship and look at it first
hand-

  wunnerful ideas wunnerful
morguma slapped odeas back affec-
tionately odea picked himself off the
floor and staggered in a great circle to the
control board

  a thin seizure beam stabbed at a corner
of the fuel broke off a generous chunk
under odeas trained fingers it moved
toward the ship through the belly lock
then it was in the cabin

iv

awthorne had been doctoring
the thermostats in the heated room
the highly volatile quintol-bac fuel started
swiftly to vaporize odea felt his head
beginning toreel as the acrid fumes filled
his lungs his eyes burned

  but the effect on the centaur was
greater he became rigid and turned even
more glassy-eyed he swayed and for a
tense second seemed about to fall over
then his eyes focussed with a desperate ef-
fort almost sobered by fear

  quintol he raised the whip not
oshygen

-planet stories-fall

  he lost his footing as hawthorne
banked the ship ordinarily this would
have been no strain on his centaur sense
of balance but the quintol was too much
for him he crashed to the floor when
he picked himself up he stood for a few
seconds stiff as rigor mortis then he
pitched down again on his face

  odea unwrapped himself from a che-
nille curtain he rubbed his head and
stared at the prostrate centaur

  what a skinful he looks almost as
bad as you paul must be something he
ate lets dump him through the lock and
hurry back to earth

  get into a space suit and stow the fuel
away growled hawthorne ill chain
this critter up and well take him home
with us but first well leave a souvenir
to those centaurs on avignon

  the fuel stowed in the tanks odea
climbed back into the ship and pulled at
his space suit fastenings he looked hap-
pily at the well-manacled centaur still in
a drunken stupor

  the air is better now he observed
lets get on our way back to earth and-
hey whatre you up to

  hawthorne was ripping the flowery seat
covers and soft curtains from their fasten-
ings piling them near the airlock when
they were all gathered he shoved them out
and watched happily through the vision
plate as they floated away from the ship

  odea grinned youre cooking with
quintol at that the boys would never
let us forget it if we came home furnished
like that

  hawthorne grunted and pulled at mor-
gumas manacles he went back to the
telescope studied space ahead for a while
then he nodded satisfied

  that one should do he mused
should do what odea wondered
that big rock ahead should be a good
farewell gift to the centaurs well fly
over their camp and-

  a knowing smile was on hawthornes
lips as he nosed up on a tiny asteroid
when they came close enough the aster-
oid proved to be bigger than the ship

  gradually they trapped it in the seizure
beams hawthorne fought grimly against
inertia the asteroid began to pull ahead
of its orbit and finally it was under full
control of their engines


planet stories

space was clear all the way back to
avignon no centaur ships were off
the ground-there was nothing to chal-
lenge them hawthorne blasted straight
for the valley of centaur ships

  the motors strained overheated with
the huge asteroid they lugged when they
entered the atmosphere the vessel dropped
almost like a dead weight

  odea looked worried

  that big factory paul thats the best
objective and youre way off from it
bear right-

  small game i hawthorne leered a su-
perior smile on his lips just do what i
said-keep your fingers one inch above
the release key and push down fast when
i give the word

  odea stared into the valley below they
were falling fast and the huge chunk of
rode almost cut off the vision but they
were moving forward as well as down
and the long lines of centaur ships and
factories were being left far behind odea
shook his head fingered with one hand
some of his bruises

  then his eyes widened dead ahead and
coming up fast to meet them was a moun-
tain from a pit in its narrow tip rose a
trickle of smoke

  get ready hawthorne shouted

  odea could almost see into the crater
he held his sweating palm ready

 now

  before hawthorne finished barking the
command odeas hand shot down re-
leasing the seizure beams the ship cata-
pulted skyward as the weight was sud-
denly dropped the pilot fought the pound-
ing rockets when it was under control
hawthorne circled back over the valley

  they stared at the mass of earth that
tumbled down the mountain side in a gath-
ering avalanche their asteroid plunged
bouncing into the valley below shaking
the entire volcano each time it hit new
avalanches started in its wake

  then the volcano exploded

  a thousand feet of rocky cone disap-
peared in a fiery murderous cloud flam-
ing lava and flying rock filled the air for
miles hawthorne worked frantically for
altitude as molten crimson streamers of
hell streaked skyward

  in avignons stratosphere they looked

down through the glaring lava that hid the

valley

  an anguished voice broke in

  oh i cannot believe it of you

  and morguma started to cry

  odea pulled the pilots chair to one
side reached into an opening in the floor
beneath it he drew forth two bundles of
clothing the two men stripped off their
greasy coveralls put on the clean clothes

  morguma stared unbelievingly at the
crisp olive green uniforms of earths space
force the grimy faces of hawthorne
and odea grinned happily from under
the jaunty caps on the shoulders of each
were the twin platinum bars of space cap-
tains

  spies oh you unnatural men to bite
the very hand that fed you-

  -and cracked the whip odea fin-
ished sharply if you want to be tech-
nical we were in uniform all the time-
those coveralls are regulation work clothes
and all is fair in love and war you know
we came to centauri on a reconnaissance
job and ran into some luck

  he sighed happily turned his eyes to the
portrait above the control board

hawthorne chuckled he was reading
a thin tape that ran through his fingers

  i have the ethertype machine running
he said news from earth and look
at the very first item

  he passed it over odeas grin dis-
appeared as he read he growled at the
tape flung it from him

  so she married a rocket hand while my
back was turned well-

he frowned for a moment then his
shoulders rose and fell in a carefree shrug

  i go bigger for blondes anyway first
thing im going to do after we report is
head for lidice venus and go on the big-
gest tear in the history of the space guard
thatll be-

  there was a faintly disturbed look in
paul hawthornes eyes but he soothed
his conscience with the thought that odea
would be just as well off without mercedes
so he saw no reason to tell captain lance
odea that he had typed out the story on
the ethertype himself because all is fair
in love as well as in war

  and captain paul hawthorne was in
love with mercedes too

grannie annie fired with deliberate speed

 grannie annie who wrote science fiction under the nom dc plume
 of annabella c flowers had stumbled onto a murderous plot
 more hair-raising than any she had ever concocted and the dan-
 ger from the villain of the piece didnt worry her-i was the guy

he was shooting at

illustration by ingels

 i was killing an hour in the billiard beg pardon thir he said with his
 room of the spacemens club in racial lisp thereth thome one to thee you
 swamp city when the venusian bell- in the main lounge his eyes rolled as
 boy came and tapped me on the shoulder he added a lady




planet

stories

  a woman here    the spacemens
was a sanctuary a rest club where in-com-
ing pilots and crewmen could relax before
leaving for another voyage the rule that
no females could pass its portals was strictly
enforced

  i followed the bellhop down the long
corridor that led to the main lounge at
the threshold i jerked to a halt and stared
incredulously

  grannie annie

  there she stood before a frantically ges-
ticulating desk clerk leaning on her faded
green umbrella a little wisp of a woman
clad in a voluminous black dress with one
of those doily-like caps on her head tied
by a ribbon under her chin her high-
topped button shoes were planted firmly on
the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face
was set in calm defiance

  i barged across the lounge and seized
her hand grannie annie i havent
seen you in two years

  hi billy-boy she greeted calmly
will you please tell this fish-face to shut
up

 the desk clerk went white mithter
trenwith if thith lady ith a friend of
yourth youll have to take her away itth
abtholutely againth the ruleth 
okay okay i grinned look well
go into the grille theres no one there
at this hour

  in the grille an equally astonished waiter
served us-me a lime rickey and grannie
annie her usual whisky sour-i waited
until she had tossed the drink off at a
gulp before i set off a chain of questions
what the devil are you doing on venus 
dont you know women arent allowed in
the spacemens what happened to the
book you were writing

  hold it billy-boy laughingly she
threw up both hands sure i knew
this place had some antiquated laws pure
fiddle-faddle thats what they are any-
way ive been thrown out of better places
she hadnt changed to her publishers
and her readers she might be annabella
c flowers author of a long list of science
fiction novels but to me she was still
grannie annie as old-fashioned as last
years hat as modern as an atomic motor
she had probably written more drivel in
the name of science fiction than anyone
alive

  but the public loved it they ate up her
stories and they clamored for more her
annual income totaled into six figures and
her publishers sat back and massaged
their digits watching their earnings mount

  one thing you had to admit about her
books they may have been dime novels
but they werent synthetic if annabella
c flowers wrote a novel and the locale
was the desert of mars she packed her
carpet bag and hopped a liner for crater-
ville if she cooked up a feud between
two expeditions on callisto she went to
callisto

  she was the most completely delightful
crackpot i had ever known

  what happened to guns for gany-
mede i asked that was the title of
your last wasnt it

grannie spilled a few shreds of
martian tobacco onto a paper and
deftly rolled herself a cigarette

  it wasnt guns it was pistols and it
wasnt ganymede it was pluto

  i grinned all complete ill bet with
threats against the universe and beautiful
earth heroines dragged in by the hair
what else is there in science fiction
she demanded you cant have your
hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster
up on the wall a clock chimed the hour
the old woman jerked to her feet

  i almost forgot billy-boy im due
at the satellite theater in ten minutes
come on youre going with me

  before i realized it i was following her
through the lounge and out to the jetty
front grannie annie hailed a hydrocar
five minutes later we drew up before the
big doors of the satellite

  they dont go in for style in swamp
city a theater to the grizzled colonials
on this side of the planet meant a shack
on stilts over the muck pilcon wood seats
and dingy atobide lamps but the place
was packed with miners freight-crew-men
-all the tide and wash of humanity that
made swamp city the frontier post it is
in front was a big sign it read

one night only
doctor universe and his
nine geniuses
the question program of
the system
doctor

  as we strode down the aisle a mangy-
looking venusian began to pound a tin-
pan piano in the pit grannie annie
pushed me into a seat in the front row

  sit here she said im sorry about
all this rush but im one of the players
in this shindig as soon as the show is
over well go somewhere and talk she
minced lightly down the aisle climbed the
stage steps and disappeared in the wings

  that damned fossilized dynamo i
muttered shell be the death of me
yet

  the piano struck a chord in g and the
curtain went rattling up on the stage
four earthmen two martians two venu-
sians and one mercurian sat on an up-
raised dais that is to say eight of them
sat the mercurian a huge lump of
granite-like flesh sprawled there palpably
uncomfortable on the right were nine
visi sets each with its new improved pan-
tascope panel and switchboard before
each set stood an earthman operator

a tall man clad in a claw-hammer
coat came out from the wings and
advanced to the footlights

  people of swamp city he said bow-
ing permit me to introduce myself i
am doctor universe and these are my
nine experts

  there was a roar of applause from the
satellite audience when it had subsided
the man continued

  as most of you are familiar with our
program it will be unnecessary to give any
advance explanation i will only say that
on this stage are nine visi sets each tuned
to one of the nine planets at transmitting
sets all over these planets listeners will
appear and voice questions these ques-
tions my nine experts will endeavor to
answer for every question missed the
sender will receive a check for one thou-
sand planetoles

  one thing more as usual we have
with us a guest star who will match her
wits with the experts may i present
that renowned writer of science fiction
annabella c flowers

  from the left wing grannie annie ap-
peared she bowed and took her place
on the dais

  the doctors program began the op-
erator of the earth visi twisted his dials

universe	

and nodded blue light flickered on the
pantascope panel to coalesce slowly into
the face of a red-haired man sharp and
clear his voice echoed through the theater
who zuas the first earthrtmn to enter
the sunward side of mercury

  doctor universe nodded and turned to
grannie annie who had raised her hand
she said quietly

  charles zanner in the year  in
a specially constructed tracto-car

  and so it went questions from mars
from earth from saturn flowed in the
visi sets isolated miners on jupiter danc-
ers in swank plutonian cafes strove to
stump the experts with doctor universe
offering bantering side play the experts
gave their answers when they failed or
when the truthicator flashed a red light
he announced the name of the winner

  it grew a little tiresome after a while
and i wondered why grannie had brought
me here and then i began to notice
things

  the audience in the satellite seemed to
have lost much of its original fervor they
applauded as before but they did so only
at the signal of doctor universe the
spell created by the man was complete

  pompous and erect he strode back and
forth across the stage like a general sur-
veying his army his black eyes gleamed
and his thin lips were turned in a smile of
satisfaction

  when the last question had been an-
swered i joined the exit-moving crowd
it was outside under the street marquee
that a strange incident occurred

  a yellow-faced kagor from the upper
martian desert country shuffled by drag-
ging his cumbersome third leg behind him
kagors of course had an unpleasant his-
tory of persecution since the early coloni-
zation days of the red planet but the
thing that happened there was a throw back
to an earlier era

  someone shouted yah yellow-facel
down with all kagors as one man
the crowd took up the cry and surged
forward the helpless kagor was seized
and flung to the pavement a knife ap-
peared from nowhere snipped the mar-
tians single lock of hair a booted foot
bludgeoned into his mouth

  moments later an official hydrocar roared
up and a dozen ip men rushed out and
	planet

scattered the crowd but a few stragglers
lingered to shout derisive epithets

  grannie annie came out from behind
the box office then she took my arm and
led me around a corner and through a
doorway under a sign that read the
jet inside was a deep room with booths
along one wall the place was all but
deserted

  in a booth well toward the rear the old
lady surveyed me with sober eyes

  billy-boy did you see the way that
crowd acted

  i nodded as disgraceful an exhibition
as ive ever seen the i p men ought
to clamp down

  the ip men arent strong enough

   she said it quietly but there was a glitter
in her eyes and a harsh line about her
usually smiling lips

  what do you mean 

i

for a moment the old lady sat there
in silence then she leaned back closed
her eyes and i knew there was a story
coming

  my last book death in the atom
hit the stands last january she be-
gan when it was finished i had
planned to take a six months vacation but
those fool publishers of mine insisted i
do a sequel well id used mars and
pluto and ganymede as settings for novels
so for this one i decided on venus i
went to venus city and i spent six weeks
in-country i got some swell background
material and i met ezra karn 

  who i interrupted

  an old prospector who lives out in the
deep marsh on the outskirts of varsoom
country to make a long story short i
got him talking about his adventures and
he told me plenty

  the old woman paused did you ever
hear of the green flames she asked
abruptly

  i shook my head some new kind
of  

  its not a new kind of anything the
green flame is a radio-active rock once
found on mercury the alpha rays of
this rock are similar to radium in that they
consist of streams of material particles
projected at high speed but the char-
acter of the gamma rays has never been
completely analyzed like those set up

stories

by radium they are electromagnetic pul-
sations but they are also a strange com-
bination of beta or cathode rays with
negatively charged electrons

  when any form of life is exposed to
these gamma rays from the green flame
rock they produce in the creatures brain
a certain lassitude and lack of energy as
the period of exposure increases this con-
dition develops into a sense of impotence
and a desire for leadership or guidance
occasionally as with the weak-willed there
is a spirit of intolerance the green flames
might be said to be an inorganic opiate a
thousand times more subtle and more pow-
erful than any known drug

  i was sitting up now hanging on to
the womans every word

  now in  as youd know if you
studied your history the three planets of
earth venus and mars were under gov-
ernmental bondage the cruel dictatorship
of vennox i was short-lived but it lasted
long enough to endanger all civilized life

   the archives tell us that one of the first
acts of the overthrowing government was
to cast out all green flames two of which
vennox had ordered must be kept in each
household the effect on the people was
immediate representative government
individual enterprise freedom followed
grannie annie lit a cigarette and flipped
the match to the floor

  to go back to my first trip to venus
as i said i met ezra karn an old pros-
pector there in the marsh karn told me
that on one of his travels into the varsoom
district he had come upon the wreckage
of an old space ship the hold of that
space ship was packed with green flames
if grannie expected me to show sur-
prise at that she was disappointed i
said so what

  so everything billy-boy do you real-
ize what such a thing would mean if it
were true  green flames were supposedly
destroyed on all planets after the vennox
regime crashed if a quantity of the rock
were in existence and it fell into the wrong
hands thered be trouble

  of course i regarded karns story as
a wild dream but it made corking good
story material i wrote it into a novel
and a week after it was completed the
manuscript was stolen from my study back
on earth
doctor

  i see i said as she lapsed into silence
and now youve come to the conclusion
that the details of your story were true
and that someone is attempting to put your
plot into action

  grannie nodded yes she said thats
exactly what i think

  i got my pipe out of my pocket tamped
martian tobacco into the bowl and laughed
heartily the same old flowers i said
tell me whos your thief    doctor
universe 

  she regarded me evenly what makes
you say that

  i shrugged

  the way the theater crowd acted it
all ties in

  the old woman shook her head no
this is a lot bigger than a simple quiz pro-
gram the theater crowd was but a cross-
section of what is happening all over the
system there have been riots on earth
and mars police officials murdered on
pluto and a demand that government by
representation be abolished on jupiter the
time is ripe for a military dictator to step
in

  and you can lay it all to the green
flames it seems incredible that a single
shipload of the ore could effect such a
wide ranged area but in my opinion some-
one has found a means of making that
quantity a thousand times more potent and
is transmiting it en masse

  if it had been anyone but grannie annie
there before me i would have called her
a fool and then all at once i got an odd
feeling of approaching danger

  lets get out of here i said getting
up

  zinnng-whack 

  all right

  on the mirror behind the bar a small
circle with radiating cracks appeared on
the booth wall a scant inch above gran-
nies head the fresco seemed to melt away
suddenly

  a heat ray

  grannie annie leaped to her feet grasped
my arm and raced for the door outside
a driverless hydrocar stood with idling
motors the old woman threw herself into
the control seat yanked me in after her
and threw over the starting stud

  an instant later we were plunging
through the dark night

universe	

six days after leaving swamp city
we reached level five the last out-
post of firm ground ahead lay the inner
marsh stretching as far as the eye could
reach low islands projected at intervals
from the thick water mold balls two
feet across drifted down from the slate-
gray sky like puffs of cotton

  we had traveled this far by ganet the
tough little two headed pack animal of
the venus hinterland any form of plane
or rocket would have had its motor in-
stantly destroyed of course by the mag-
netic force belt that encircled the planets
equator now our drivers changed to
boatmen and we loaded our supplies into
three clumsy jagua canoes

  it was around the camp fire that night
that grannie took me into her confidence
for the first time since we had left swamp
city

  were heading directly for varsoom
country she said if we find ezra
karn so much the better if we dont
we follow his directions to the lost space
ship our job is to find that ore and de-
stroy it you see im positive the green
flames have never been removed from
the ship

  sleep had never bothered me yet that
night i lay awake for hours tossing rest-
lessly the thousand sounds of the blue
marsh droned steadily and the news
broadcast i had heard over the portable
visi just before retiring still lingered in
my mind to a casual observer that broad-
cast would have meant little a slight re-
bellion here an isolated crime there but
viewed from the perspective grannie had
given me everything dovetailed the sit-
uation on jupiter was swiftly coming to
a head not only had the people on that
planet demanded that representative gov-
ernment be abolished but a forum was
now being held to find a leader who might
take complete dictatorial control

  outside a whisper-worm hissed softly
i got up and strode out of my tent for
some time i stood there lost in thought
could i believe grannies incredible story
or was this another of her fantastic plots
which she had skilfully blended into a
novel 

  abruptly i stiffened the familiar drone
of the marsh was gone in its place a
ringing silence blanketed everything
	planet

    and then out in the gloom a darker
  shadow appeared moving in undulating
  sweeps toward the center of the camp
  fascinated i watched it advance and re-
  treat saw two hyalescent eyes swim out
  of the murk it charged and with but
  a split second to act i threw myself flat

 there was a rush of mighty wings as the
  thing swept over me sharp talons raked
  my clothing again it came and again i
  rolled swiftly missing the thing by the
  narrowest of margins

    from the tent opposite a gaunt figure
  clad in a familiar dress appeared gran-
  nie gave a single warning

     stand still

    the thing in the darkness turned like a
  cam on a rod and drove at us again this
  time the old womans heat gun clicked
  and a tracery of purple flame shot outward
  a horrible soul-chilling scream rent the
  air a moment later something huge and
  heavy scrabbled across the ground and
  shot aloft

    i stood frozen as the diminuendo of its
  wild cries echoed back to me

    in heavens name what was it
  hunter-bird grannie said calmly a
  form of avian life found here in the swamp
  harmless in its wild state but when cap-
  tured it can be trained to pursue a quarry
  until it kills it has a single unit brain
  and follows with a relentless purpose
  then that would mean   

    that it was sent by our enemy the
  same enemy that shot at us in the cafe
  in swamp city exactly grannie annie
  halted at the door of her tent and faced
  me with earnest eyes billy-boy our
  every move is being watched from now
  on its the survival of the fittest

 the following day was our
 seventh in the swamp the water
 here resembled a vast mosaic striped and
 cross-striped with long winding ribbons
 of yellowish substance that floated a few
 inches below the surface the mold balls
 coming into contact with the evonium
 water of the swamp had undergone a chem-
 ical change and evolved into a cohesive
 multi-celled marine life that lived and died
 within a space of hours the venusians
 paddled with extreme care had one of
 them dipped his hand into one of those

stories

yellow streaks he would have been de-
voured in a matter of seconds

  at high noon by my earth watch i
sighted a low white structure on one of
the distant islands moments later we
made a landing at a rude jetty and gran-
nie annie was introducing me to ezra
karn

  he was not as old a man as i had ex-
pected but he was ragged and unkempt
with iron gray hair falling almost to his
shoulders he was dressed in varpa cloth
the venus equivalent of buckskin and on
his head was an enormous flop-brimmed
hat

  glad to meet you he said shaking
my hand any friend of miss flowers
is a friend of mine he ushered us down
the catwalk into his hut

  the place was a two room affair small
but comfortable the latest type of visi
set in one corner showed that karn was
not isolated from civilization entirely

 grannie annie came to the point
abruptly when she had explained the
object of our trip the prospector became
thoughtful

  green flames eh  he repeated slowly
well yes i suppose i could find that space
ship again that is if i wanted to

  what do you mean grannie paused
in the act of rolling herself a cigarette
you know where it is dont you

  ye-s karn nodded but like i told
you before that ship lies in varsoom
country and that isnt exactly a summer
vacation spot

  what are the varsoom i asked a
native tribe

  karn shook his head theyre a form
of life thats never been seen by earthmen
strictly speaking theyre no more than a
form of energy

  dangerous 

  yes and no only man i ever heard
of who escaped their country outside of
myself was the explorer darthier three
years ago i got away because i was
alone and they didnt notice me and
darthier escaped because he made em
laugh

  laugh a scowl crossed grannies
face

  thats right karn said the var-
soom have a strange nervous reaction thats
manifested by laughing but just what
doctor universe



it is that makes them laugh i dont know

  food supplies and fresh drinking water
were replenished at the hut several mold
guns were borrowed from the prospectors
supply to arm the venusians and then
as we were about to leave karn suddenly
turned

  the doctor universe program he
said i aint missed one in months you
gotta wait til i hear it

  grannie frowned in annoyance but the
prospector was adamant he flipped a
stud twisted a dial and a moment later
was leaning back in a chair listening with
avid interest

  it was the same show i had witnessed
back in swamp city once again i heard
questions filter in from the far outposts
of the system once again i saw the com-
manding figure of the quiz master as he
strode back and forth across the stage
and as i sat there looking into the visi
screen a curious numbing drowsiness
seemed to steal over me and lead my
thoughts far away

half an hour later we headed into
the unknown the venusian boat-
men were ill-at-ease now and jabbered
among themselves constantly we camped
that night on a miserable little island where
insects swarmed about us in hordes the
next day an indefinable wave of weariness
and despondency beset our entire party
i caught myself musing over the futility
of the venture only the pleadings of
grannie annie kept me from turning back
on the morrow i realized the truth in her
warning that all of us had been exposed
to the insidious radiations

  after that i lost track of time day
after day of incessant rain  of steam-
ing swamp    but at length we reached
firm ground and began our advance on
foot

  it was karn who first sighted the ship
striding in the lead he suddenly halted
at the top of a hill and leveled his arm
before him there it lay a huge cigar-
shaped vessel of blackened arelium steel
half buried in the swamp soil

  whats that thing on top karn de-
manded puzzled

  a rectangular metal envelope had been
constructed over the stem quarters of the
ship above this structure were three tall

masts and suspended between them was
a network of copper wire studded with
white insulators

  grannie gazed a long moment through
binoculars billy-boy take three venus-
ians and head across the knoll she or-
dered ezra and i will circle in from the
west fire agun if you strike trouble

  but we found no trouble the scene be-
fore us lay steeped in silence moments
later our two parties converged at the base
of the great ship

  a metal ladder extended from the en-
velope down the side of the vessel mid-
way we could see a circular hatch-like
door

  up we go billy-boy heat gun in
readiness grannie annie began to climb
slowly

  the silence remained absolute we
reached the door and pulled it open there
was no sign of life

  somebodys gone to a lot of trouble
here ezra kam observed

  somebody had before us stretched a
narrow corridor flanked on the left side by
a wall of impenetrable stepto glass the
corridor was bare of furnishings but be-
yond the glass revealed to us in mocking
clarity was a high panel studded with
dials and gauges even as we looked we
could see liquid pulse in glass tubes indi-
cator needles swing slowly to and fro

  grannie nodded some kind of a
broadcasting unit the green flames in
the lower hold are probably exposed to a
t hoi pane plate and their radiations stepped
lip by an electro-phosicalic process

  karn raised the butt of his pistol and
brought it crashing against the glass wall
his arm jumped in recoil but the glass re-
mained intact

  youll never do it that way grannie
said nothing short of an atomic blast
will shatter that wall it explains why there
are no guards here the mechanism is en-
tirely self-operating lets see if the green
flames are more accessible

  in the lower hold disappointment again
confronted us visible in the feeble shafts
of daylight that filtered through cracks in
the vessels hull were tiers of rectangular
ingots of green iridescent ore suspended
by insulators from the ceiling over them
was a thick metal plate
	planet

  but between was a barrier a wall of
impenetrable stepto glass

  grannie stamped her foot its mad-
dening she said here we are at the
crux of the whole matter and were power-
less to make a single move

outside the day was beginning to
wane the venusians apparently
unawed by the presence of the space ship
had already started a fire and erected the
tents we left the vessel to find a spell of
brooding desolation heavy over the impro-
vised camp and the evening meal this
time was a gloomy affair when it was
finished ezra karn lit his pipe and
switched on the portable visi set a mo-
ment later the silence of the march was
broken by the opening fanfare of the doc-
tor universe program 

  great stuff karn commented i sent
in a couple of questions once but i never
did win nothin this doctor universe is
a great guy ought to make him king or
somethin

  for a moment none of us made reply
then suddenly grannie annie leaped to
her feet

  say that again  she cried

  the old prospector looked startled
why i only said they ought to make this
doctor universe the big boss and 
thats it grannie paced ten yards off
into the gathering darkness and returned
quickly billy-boy you were right the
man behind this is doctor universe it
was he who stole my manuscript and de-
vised a method to amplify the radiations
of the green flames in the freighters hold
he lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast
those radiations in such a way that millions
of persons would be exposed to them simul-
taneously dont you see 

  i didnt see but grannie hurried on
what better way to expose civilized life
to the green flames radiations than when
the people are in a state of relaxation the
doctor universe quiz program the whole
system tuned in on them but they were
only a blind to cover up the transmission
of the radiations from the ore their power
must have been amplified a thousandfold
and their wave-length must lie somewhere
between light and the supersonic scale in
that transition band which so far has defied
exploration 

stories

  but with what motive  i demanded
why should    

  power the old woman answered
the old thirst for dictatorial control of
the masses by presenting himself as an
intellectual genius doctor universe util-
ized a bizarre method to intrench himself
in the minds of the people oh dont you
see billy-boy the green flames radia-
tions spell doom to freedom individual lib-
erty

  i sat there stupidly wondering if this
all were some wild dream

  and then as i looked across at gran-
nie annie the vague light over the tents
seemed to shift a little as if one layer of
the atmosphere had dropped away to be
replaced by another

  there it was again a definite movement
in the air somehow i got the impression
i was looking around that space rather
than through it and simultaneously ezra
karn uttered a howl of pain an instant
later the old prospector was rolling over
and over threshing his arms wildly

  an invisible sledge hammer descended
on my shoulder the blow was followed
by another and another heavy unseen
hands held me down opposite me gran-
nie annie and the venusians were suffer-
ing similar punishment the latter scream-
ing in pain and bewilderment

  its the varsoom ezra karn yelled
weve got to make em laugh our only
escape is to make em laugh

  he struggled to his feet and began leap-
ing wildly around the camp fire abruptly
his foot caught on a log protruding from
the fire he tripped and fell headlong into
a mass of hot coals and ashes like a
jumping jack he was on his feet again
clawing dirt and soot from his eyes

  out of the empty space about us there
came a sudden hush the unseen blows
ceased in mid-career and then the si-
lence was rent by wild laughter peal
after peal of mirthful yells pounded against
our ears for many moments it continued
then it died away and everything was
peaceful once more

  grannie annie picked herself up slowly
that was close she said i wouldnt
want to go through that again

  ezra karn nursed an ugly welt under
one eye those varsoom got a funny
sense of humor he growled
doctor

inside the freighters narrow corridor
grannie faced me with eyes filled with
excitement

  billy-boy she said weve got two
problems now weve got to stop doctor
universe and weve got to find a way of
getting out of here right now were
nicely bottled up

  as if in answer to her words the visi
set revealed the face of the quiz master
on the screen he was saying
remember tomorrow at this same hour
i will have a message of unparalleled im-
portance for the people of the nine planets
tomorrow night i urge you i command
you to tune in

  with a whistling intake of breath the
old woman turned to one of the venusians

  bring all our equipment in here she
ordered hurry

  she untied the ribbon under her chin
and took off her cap she rolled up her
sleeves and as the venusians came march-
ing into the space ship with bundles of
equipment she fell to work

  silently ezra karn and i watched her
first she completely dismantled the visi
set put it together again with an entirely
altered hookup next she unrolled a coil
of flexible copper mesh which we had
brought along as a protective electrical
screening against the marsh insects she
fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh
at intervals of every twelve inches or more
carried it down to the freighters hold and
fastened it securely against the stepto glass
wall

  trailing a three-ply conduit up from the
hold to the corridor she selected an induc-
tion coil several micro-wellman tubes and
a quantity of wire from a box of spare
parts dexterously her fingers moved in
and out fashioning a complicated and curi-
ous piece of apparatus

  its pretty hay-wire she said but i
think it will work now ill tell you what
im going to do when doctor universe
broadcasts tomorrow night hes going to
announce that he has set himself up as
supreme dictator hell have the green
flame radiations coming from this ship
under full power im going to insert into
his broadcast-the laughing of the var-
soom

  youre going to what

universe	

  broadcast the mass laughter from those
invisible creatures out there visualize it
billy-boy at the dramatic moment when
doctor universe makes his plea for sys-
tem-wide power he will be accompanied by
wild peals of laughter the whole broad-
cast will be turned into a burlesque

  how you going to make em laugh
interrupted karn

  we must think of a way grannie re-
plied soberly

  i for one am glad that no representa-
tive of the interstellar psychiatry society
witnessed our antics during the early hours
of that morning and on into the long
reaches of the afternoon as we vainly tried
to provoke the laughter of the varsoom
all to no avail utter silence greeted our
efforts and the time was growing close
to the scheduled doctor universe program

  ezra karn wiped a bead of perspiration
from his brow maybe weve got to at-
tract their attention first he suggested
miss flowers why dont you go up on
the roof and read to em read em some-
thing from one of your books if youve got
one along that ought to make em sit
up and take notice 

  for a moment the old woman gazed at
him in silence then she got to her feet
quickly

  ill do it she said ill read them
the attack scene from murder on a space
liner

  t didnt make sense of course but
nothing made sense in this mad ven-
ture grannie annie opened her duffel
bag and drew out a copy of her most popu-
lar book with the volume under her arm
she mounted the ladder to the top of the
envelope ezra karn rigged up a radite
search lamp and a moment later the old
woman stood in the center of a circle of
white radiance

  karn gripped my arm this is it he
said tensely if this fails 

  his voice clipped off as grannie began
to read she read slowly at first then
intoned the words and sentences faster
and more dramatically

  and out in the swamp a vast hush fell
as if unseen ears were listening

      the space liner was over on her
beam ends now as another shot from the
raiders vessel crashed into the stern hold

wringing her hands in mute appeal

  a restless rustling sounded out in the
marsh as if hundreds of bodies were surg-

  shes got em he whispered listen
theyre eatin up every word

  i heard it then and i thought i must
be dreaming from somewhere out in
the swamp a sound rose into the thick air
a high-pitched chuckle it was the chuckle
came again now it was followed by an-
other and another an instant later a wave
of low subdued laughter rose into the air

  ezra karn gulped gripes he said
theyre laughing already theyre laugh-
ing at her book and look the old ladys
gettin sore

  up on the roof of the evelope grannie
annie halted her reading to glare savagely
out into the darkness

  the laughter was a roar now it rose
louder and louder peal after peal of mirth-

she shook her fist at the unseen hordes out

screamed you dont know good science

  i	turned to karn and said quietly turn
on the visi set doctor universe should

  be broadcasting now tune your micro-

as you can

it took three weeks to make the re-
turn trip to swamp city the var-
soom followed us far beyond the frontier
of their country like an unseen army in the

reached level five did the last chuckle
fade into the distance

  all during that trek back grannie sat
in the dugout staring silently out before
her

news was flung at us from all sides one

the eyes of thar

by henry kuttner

she spoke in a tongue dead a thousand years and she had no
memory for the man she faced yet he had held her tightly but
a few short years before had sworn eternal vengeance-when
she died in his arms from an assassins wounds

illustration by doolin

he had come back though he knew	tian fortress so many years ago not often

what to expect he had always	and always warily for there was a price

come back to klanvahr since he	on dantans head and those who governed

had been hunted out of that ancient mar-	the dry provinces would have been glad


	planet

to pay it now there was an excellent
chance that they might pay and soon he
thought as he walked doggedly through
the baking stillness of the night his ears
attuned to any dangerous sound in the thin
dry air

  even after dark it was hot here the
dead ground parched and arid retained
the heat releasing it slowly as the double
moons-the eyes of thar in klanvahr
mythology-swung across the blazing im-
mensity of the sky yet samuel dantan
came back to this desolate land as he had
come before drawn by love and by hatred

  the love was lost forever but the hate
could still be satiated he had not yet
glutted his blood-thirst when dantan
came back to klanvahr men died though
if all the men of the redhelm tribe were
slain even that could not satisfy the dull
ache in dantans heart

  now they were hunting him

  the girl-he had not thought of her for
years he did not want to remember he
had been young when it happened of
earth stock he had during a great martian
drought become godson to an old shaman
of klanvahr one of the priests who still
hoarded scraps of the forgotten knowledge
of the past glorious days of martian des-
tiny when bright towers had fingered up
triumphantly toward the eyes of thar

  memories    the solemn antique dig-
nity of the undercities in ruins now   
the wrinkled shaman intoning his rituals
   very old books and older stories   
raids by the redhelm tribe    and a girl
samuel dantan had known there was a
raid and the girl had died such things
had happened many times before they
would happen again but to dantan this
one death mattered very much

  afterward dantan killed first in red
fury then with a cool quiet passionless
satisfaction and since the redhelms were
well represented in the corrupt martian
government he had become outlaw

  the girl would not have known him now
he had gone out into the spaceways and
the years had changed him he was still
thin his eyes still dark and opaque as
shadowed tarn-water but he was dry and
sinewy and hard moving with the trained
dangerous swiftness of the predator he
was-and as to morals dantan had none
worth mentioning he had broken more

stories

than ten commandments between the
planets and in the far-flung worlds border-
ing the outer dark there are more than ten
but dantan had smashed them all

  in the end there was still the dull sicken-
ing hopelessness part loneliness part some-
thing less definable hunted he came back
to klanvahr and when he came men of
the redhelms died they did not die easily

  but this time it was they who hunted
not he they had cut him off from the air-
car and they followed now like hounds upon
his track he had almost been disarmed in
that last battle and the redhelms would
not lose the trail they had followed sign
for generations across the dying tundras
of mars

  he paused flattening himself against an
outcrop of rock and looked back it was
dark the eyes of thar had not yet risen
and the blaze of starlight cast a ghastly
leprous shine over the chaotic slope behind
him great riven boulders and jutting mono-
liths canyon-like running jagged toward
the horizon a scene of cosmic ruin that
every old and shrinking world must show
he could see nothing of his pursuers but
they were coming they were still far be-
hind but that did not matter he must
circle-circle-

  and first he must regain a little strength
there was no water in his canteen his
throat was dust-dry and his tongue felt
swollen and leathery moving his shoul-
ders uneasily his dark face impassive
dantan found a pebble and put it in his
mouth though he knew that would not help
much he had not tasted water for-how
long too long anyhow

staring around he took stock of re-
sources he was alone-what was it
the old shaman had once told him you
are never alone in klanvahr the living
shadows of the past are all around you
they cannot help but they watch and their
pride must not be humbled you are never
alone in klanvahr

  but nothing stirred only a whisper of
the dry hot wind murmuring up from the
distance sighing and soughing like muted
harps ghosts of the past riding the night
dantan thought how did those ghosts
see klanvahr not as this desolate waste-
land perhaps they saw it with the eyes of
memory as the mother of empires which
the eyes

of thar



klanvahr had once been so long ago that
only the tales persisted garbled and un-
believable

  a sighing whisper  he stopped living
for a second his breath halted his eyes
turned to emptiness that meant some-
thing a thermal a river of wind-a
downdraft perhaps sometimes these eon-
old canyons held lost rivers changing and
shifting their courses as mars crumbled
and such watercourses might be traced by
sound

  well-be knew klanvahr

  a half mile farther he found the arroyo
not too deep-fifty feet or less with jagged
walls easy to descend he could hear the
trickle of water though he could not see
it and his thirst became overpowering but
caution made him clamber down the preci-
pice warily he did not drink till he had
reconnoitered and made sure that it was
safe

  and that made dantans thin lips curl
safety for a man hunted by the redhelms 
the thought was sufficiently absurd he
would die-he must die but he did not
mean to die alone this time perhaps they
had him but the kill would not be easy nor
without cost if he could find some weap-
on some ambush-prepare some trap for
the hunters-

  there might be possibilities in this can-
yon the stream had only lately been di-
verted into this channel the signs of that
were clear thoughtfully dantan worked
his way upstream he did not try to mask
his trail by water-tricks the redhelms
were too wise for that no there must be
some other answer

  a mile or so farther along he found the
reason for the diverted stream landslide
where water had chuckled and rustled
along the left-hand branch before now it
took the other route dantan followed the
dry canyon finding the going easier now
since phobos had risen  an eye of thar
the eyes of the god miss nothing they
move across the world and nothing can
hide from thar or from his destiny

  then dantan saw rounded metal
washed clean by the water that had run
here lately a corroded curved surface rose
dome-shaped from the stream bed

  the presence of an artifact in this place
was curious enough the people of klan-
vahr-the old race-had builded with some

substance that had not survived plastic or
something else that was not metal yet
this dome had the unmistakable dull sheen
of steel it was an alloy unusually strong
or it could never have lasted this long even
though protected by its covering of rocks
and earth a little nerve began jumping in
dantans cheek he had paused briefly
but now he came forward and with his
booted foot kicked away some of the dirt
about the cryptic metal

  a curving line broke it scraping vigor-
ously dantan discovered that this marked
the outline of an oval door horizontal and
with a handle of some sort though it was
caked and fixed in its socket with dirt
dantans lips were very thin now and his
eyes glittering and bright an ambush-a
weapon against the redhelms-whatever
might exist behind this lost door it was
worth investigating especially for a con-
demned man

  with water from the brook and a sliver
of sharp stone he pried and chiseled until
the handle was fairly free from its heavy
crust it was a hook like a shepherds
crook protruding from a small bowl-shaped
depression in the door dantan tested it
it would not move in any direction he
braced himself legs straddled body half
-doubled and strained at the hook

  blood beat against the back of his eyes
he heard drumming in his temples and
straightened suddenly thinking it the foot-
steps of redhelms then grinning sar-
donically he bent to his work again and
this time the handle moved

  beneath him the door slid down and
swung aside and the darkness below gave
place to soft light he saw a long tube
stretching down vertically with pegs pro-
truding from the metal walls at regular
intervals it made a ladder the bottom of
the shaft was thirty feet below its diam-
eter was little more than the breadth of a
big mans shoulders

he stood still for a moment looking
down his mind almost swimming
with wonder and surmise old very old
it must be for the stream had cut its own
bed out of the rock whose walls rose above
him now old-and yet these metal sur-
faces gleamed as brightly as they must have
gleamed on the day they were put together
-for what purpose 


planet

stories

  the wind sighed again down the canyon
and dantan remembered the redhelms on
his track he looked around once more
and then lowered himself onto the ladder
of metal pegs testing them doubtfully be-
fore he let his full weight come down they
held

  there might be danger down below
there might not there was certain danger
coming after him among the twisting can-
yons he reached up investigated briefly
and swung the door back into place there
was a lock he saw and after a moment
discovered how to manipulate it so far
the results were satisfactory he was tem-
porarily safe from the redhelms provided
he did not suffocate there was no air
intake here that he could see but he
breathed easily enough so far he would
worry about that when the need arose
there might be other tilings to worry about
before lack of air began to distress him

  he descended

  at the bottom of the shaft was another
door its handle yielded with no resistance
this time and dantan stepped across the
threshold into a large square underground
chamber lit with pale radiance that came
from the floor itself as though light had
been poured into the molten metal when
it had first been made

  the room-

  faintly he heard a distant humming like
the after-resonance of a bell but it died
away almost instantly the room was large
and empty except for some sort of machine
standing against the farther wall dantan
was not a technician he knew guns and
ships that was enough but the smooth
sleek functionalism of this machine gave
him an almost sensuous feeling of pleasure

  how long had it been here who had
built it  and for what purpose  he could
not even guess there was a great oval
screen on the wall above what seemed to be
a control board and there were other more
enigmatic devices

  and the screen was black-dead black
with a darkness that ate up the light in the
room and gave back nothing

  yet there was something-

  sanfel a voice said sanfel coth
drgchang sanfel-sthan

  sanfel   sanfel  have you returned
sanfel answer

  it was a womans voice  the voice of

a woman used to wielding power quiet
somehow proud as the voice of lucifer or
lilith might have been and it spoke in a
tongue that scarcely half a dozen living men
could understand  a whole great race
had spoken it once only the shamans re-
membered now and the shamans who knew
it were few dantans godfather had been
one and dantan remembered the slur-
ring syllables of the rituals he had learned
well enough to know what the proud bodi-
less voice was saying

  the nape of his neck prickled here
was something he could not understand
and he did not like it like an animal
scenting danger he shrank into himself not
crouching but withdrawing so that a
smaller man seemed to stand there ready
and waiting for the next move only his
eyes were not motionless they raked the
room for the unseen speaker-for some
weapon to use when the time came for
weapons

  his glance came back to the dark screen
above the machine and the voice said
again in the tongue of ancientklanvahr
i am not used to waiting sanfel if
you hear me speak and speak quickly
for the time of peril comes close now my
enemy is strong-

  dantan said can you hear me his
eyes did not move from the screen

  out of that blackness the girls voice
came after a pause it was imperious
and a little wary

  you are not sanfel where is he
who are you martian

dantan let himself relax a little
there would be a parley at any rate
but after that-

  words in the familiar remembered old
language came hesitantly to his lips

  i am no martian i am of earth blood
and i do not know this sanfel

  then how did you get into sanfels
place  the voice was haughty now
what are you doing there sanfel built
his laboratory in a secret place

  it was hidden well enough dantan
told her grimly maybe for a thousand
years or even ten thousand for all i know
the door has been buried under a
stream-

  there is no water there sanfels home
is on a mountain and his laboratory is built
the eyes

underground the voice rang like a bell
i think you lie i think you are an ene-
my- when i heard the signal summoning
me i came swiftly wondering why sanfel
had delayed so long i must find him
stranger i must i f you are no enemy
bring me sanfel this time there was
something almost like panic in the voice

	if i could i would dantan said but
theres no one here except me he hesi-
tated wondering if the woman behind the
voice could be-mad speaking from some
mysterious place beyond the screen in a
language dead a thousand years calling
upon a man who must be long-dead too if
one could judge by the length of time this
hidden room had lain buried

  he said after a moment this place has
been buried for a long time and-no one
has spoken the tongue of klanvahr for
many centuries if that was your sanfels
language- but he could not go on with
that thought if sanfel had spoken klan-
vahr then he must have died long ago and
the speaker beyond the screen-she who
had known sanfel yet spoke in a young
sweet light voice that dantan was begin-
ning to think sounded familiar    he
wondered if he could be mad too

  there was silence from the screen after
many seconds the voice spoke again sadly
and with an undernote of terror

   i had not realized it said that even
time might be so different between sanfels
world and mine the space-time continua
-yes a day in my world might well be an
age in yours time is elastic in zha i
had thought a few dozen- she used a
term dantan did not understand -had
passed but on mars-centuries

   tens of centuries agreed dantan star-
ing hard at the screen if sanfel lived in
old klanvahr his people are scarcely a
memory now and mars is dying you-
youre speaking from another world
from another universe yes a very
different universe from yours it was only
through sanfel that i had made contact
until now- what is your name

  dantan samuel dantan

  not a martian name you are from-
earth you say what is that

  another planet nearer the sun than
mars

  we have no planets and no suns in zha

-planet stories-fall

of thar	

this is a different universe indeed so
different i find it hard to imagine what
your world must be like the voice died

and it was a voice he knew dantan
was nearly sure of that now and the
certainty frightened him when a man in
the martian desert begins to see or hear
impossibilities he has reason to be fright-
ened as the silence prolonged itself he
began almost to hope that the voice-the
implausibly familiar voice-had been only
imagination hesitantly he said are you
still there and was a little relieved after
all to hear her say

  yes i am here i was thinking   
i need help i need it desperately i
wonder-has sanfels laboratory changed
does the machine still stand  but it must
or i could not speak to you now if the
other things work there nay be chance   
listen her voice grew urgent i may
have a use for you do you see a lever
scarlet marked with the klanvahr symbol
for sight

  i see it dantan said

  push it forward there is no harm in
that if you are careful we can see each
other-that is all but do not touch the
lever with the door symbol on it be
certain of that  wait sudden urgency
was in the voice

  yes dantan had not moved

  i am forgetting there is danger if
you are not protected from-from certain
vibration that you might see here this is a
different universe and your martian physi-
cal laws do not hold good between our
worlds vibration    light    other
things might harm you there should be
armor in sanfels laboratory find it
dantan glanced around there was a
cabinet in one corner he went over to it
slowly his eyes wary he had no inten-
tion of relaxing vigilance here simply be-
cause that voice sounded familiar   

  inside the cabinet hung a suit of some-
thing like space armor more flexible and
skin tight than any he had ever seen and
with a transparent helmet through which
vision seemed oddly distorted he got-into
the suit carefully pulling up the rich shin-
ing folds over his body thinking strangely
how long time had stood still in this small
room since the last time a man had worn
it the whole room looked slightly differ-
	planet

ent when he set the helmet into place it
must be polarized he decided though that
alone could not account for the strange
dimming and warping of vision that was
evident

  all ready he said after a moment

  then throw the switch

  with his hand upon it dantan hesitated
for one last instant of wariness he was
stepping into unknown territory now and
to him the unknown meant the perilous
his mind went back briefly to the redhelms
scouring the canyons above for him he
quieted his uneasy mind with the thought
that there might be some weapon in the
world of the voice which he could turn
against them later certainly without a
weapon he had little to lose but he knew
that weapon or no weapon danger or not
he must see the face behind that sweet
familiar imperious voice

  he pressed the lever forward it hesi-
tated the weight of milleniums behind its
inertia then groaning a little in its socket
it moved

  across the screen above it a blaze of
color raged like a sudden shining deluge
blinded by the glare dantan leaped back
and swung an arm across his eyes

  when he looked again the colors had
cleared blinking he stared-and forgot
to look away for the screen was a win-
dow now with the world of zha behind it
   and in the center of that window-a
girl he looked once at her and then
closed his eyes he had felt his heart move
and a nerve jumped in his lean cheek

  he whispered a name

  impassively the girl looked down at him
from the screen there was no change no
light of recognition upon that familiar be-
loved face the face of the girl who had
died at the redhelm hands long ago in the
fortress of klanvahr    for her sake he
had hunted the redhelms all these danger-
ous years for her sake he had taken to
the spaceways and the outlaw life in a
way for her sake the redhelms hunted him
now through the canyons overhead but
here in the screen she did not know him

  he knew that this was not possible some
outrageous trick of vision made the face
and the slender body of a woman from
another universe seem the counterpart of
that remembered woman but he knew it
must be an illusion for in a world as differ-

stories

ent as zha surely there could be no human
creatures at all certainly no human who
wore the same face as the girl he remem-
bered

aside from the girl herself there was
nothing to see the screen was blank
except for vague shapes-outlines- the
helmet he thought filtered out more than
light he sensed somehow that beyond
her stretched the world of zha but he
could see nothing except the shifting ever-
changing colors of the background

  she looked down at him without expres-
sion obviously the sight of him had wak-
ened in her no such deep-reaching echoes
of emotion as her face woke in him she
said her voice almost unbearably familiar
a voice sounding from the silence of death
over many chilly years

 dantan samuel dantan earthly
language is as harsh as the klanvahr i
learned from sanfel yet my name may
seem strange to you i am quiana

  he said hoarsely what do you want
what did you want with sanfel

  help quiana said a weapon san-
fel had promised me a weapon he was
working very hard to make one risking
much    and now time has eaten him up-
that strange capricious time that varies so
much between your world and mine to
me it was only yesterday-and i still need
the weapon

  dantans laugh was harsh with jealousy
of that unknown and long-dead martian

  then fm the wrong man he said
roughly ive no weapon ive men track-
ing me down to kill me now

  she leaned forward a little gesturing
can you escape you are hidden here
you know

  theyll find the same way i found up
above

  the laboratory door can be locked at
the top of the shaft

  i know i locked it but theres no
food or water here  no if i had any
weapons i wouldnt be here now

  would you not  she asked in a curious
voice in old klanvahr sanfel once told
me they had a saying that none could hide
from his destiny

  dantan gave her a keen inquiring look
did she mean-herself that same face
and voice and body so cruelly come back
the eyes

from death to waken the old grief anew
or did she know whose likeness she wore
-or could it be only his imagination after
all for if sanfel had known her too and
if sanfel had died as long ago as he must
have died then this same lovely image had
lived centuries and milleniums before the
girl at klanvahr fortress   

  i remember said dantan briefly

  my world she went on oblivious to
the turmoil in his mind my world is too
different to offer you any shelter though i
suppose you could enter it for a little while
in that protective armor that sanfel made
but not to stay we spring from soil too
alien to one anothers worlds    even this
communication is not easy and there is
no safety here in zha either now now
that sanfel has failed me

  i-id help you if i could he said it
with difficulty trying to force the remem-
brance upon himself that this was a stran-
ger    tell me whats wrong

  she shrugged with a poignantly familiar
motion

  i have an enemy one of a lower race
and he-it-there is no word-has cut me
off from my people here in a part of zha
that is-well dangerous-i cant describe
to you the conditions here we have no
common terms to use in speaking of them
but there is great danger and the enemy
is coming closer-and i am alone if there
were another of my people here to divide
the peril i think i could destroy him he
has a weapon of his own and it is stronger
than my power though not stronger than
the power two of my race together can
wield it-it pulls it destroys in a way
i can find no word to say i had hoped
from sanfel something to divert him until
he could be killed i told him how to forge
such a weapon but-time would not let him
do it the teeth of time ground him into
dust as my enemys weapon will grind me
soon

  she shrugged again

  if i could get you a gun dantan said
a force-ray-

  what are they

  he described the weapons of his day
but quianas smile was a little scornful
when he finished

  we of zha have passed beyond the use
of missile weapons-even such missiles as
bullets or rays nor could they touch my

of t ham	

enemy no we can destroy in ways that
require no-no beams or explosives no
dantan you speak in terms of your own
universe we have no common ground it
is a pity that time eddied between sanfel
and me but eddy it did and i am helpless
now and the enemy will be upon me
soon very soon

she let her shoulders sag and resigna-
tion dimmed the remembered vividness
of her face dantan looked up at her grim-
ly muscles riding his set jaw it was al-
most intolerable this facing her again in
need and again helpless and himself with-
out power to aid it had been bad enough
that first time to learn long afterward that
she had died at enemy hands while he was
too far away to protect her but to see it
all take place again before his very eyes

  there must be a way he said and his
hand gripped the lever marked door in
the ancient tongue

  wait quianas voice was urgent
  what would happen

  the door would open i could enter
your world and you mine

  why cant you leave then and wait
until its safe to go back 

  i have tried that quiana said it
will never be safe the enemy waited too
no it must come in the end to a battle-
and i shall not win that fight i shall not
see my own people or my own land again
and i suppose i must face that knowledge
but i did hope when i heard sanfels sig-
nal sound again    she smiled a little
i know you would help me if you could
dantan but there is nothing to be done
now

  ill come in he said doggedly may-
be theres something i could do

  you could not touch him even now
theres danger he was very close when

i	heard that signal this is his territory
when i heard the bell and thought sanfel
had returned with a weapon for me i dared
greatly in coming here her voice died
away a withdrawn look veiled her eyes
from him

  after a long silence she said the ene-
my is coming turn off the screen dantan
and goodbye

  no he said wait but she shook
her head and turned away from him her
thin robe swirling and moved off like a
	planet

pale shadow into the dim shadowless emp-
tiness of the background he stood watch-
ing helplessly feeling all the old despair
wash over him a second time as the girl he
loved went alone into danger he could not
share sometimes as she moved away she
was eclipsed by objects he could not see-
trees he thought or rocks that did not
impinge upon his eyes through the protec-
tive helmet a strange world indeed zha
must be whose very rocks and trees were
too alien for human eyes to look upon in
safety    only quiana grew smaller and
smaller upon the screen and it seemed to
dantan as though a cord stretched between
them pulling thinner and thinner as she
receded into danger and distance

  it was unbearable to think that the cord
might break-break a second time   

  far away something moved in the cloudy
world of zha tiny in the distance though
it was it was unmistakably not human
dantan lost sight of quiana had she
found some hiding place behind some un-
imaginable outcropping of zhas terrain

  the enemy came forward

  it was huge and scaled and terrible
human but not a human tailed but no
beast intelligent but diabolic he never
saw it too clearly and he was grateful to
his helmet for that the polarized glass
seemed to translate a little as well as to
blot out he felt sure that this creature
which he saw-or almost saw-did not look
precisely as it seemed to him upon the
screen yet it was easy to believe that such
a being had sprung from the alien soil of
zha there was nothing remotely like it on
any of the worlds he knew and it was
hateful every line of it made his hackles
bristle

  it carried a coil of brightly colored tub-
ing slung over one grotesque shoulder and
its monstrous head swung from side to side
as it paced forward into the screen like
some strange and terrible mechanical toy
it made no sound and its progress was
horrible in its sheer relentless monotony

abruptly it paused he thought it
had sensed the girls presence some-
where in hiding it reached for the coil of
tubing with one malformed-hand

  quiana it said-its voice as gentle as
a childs

stories

  silence dantans breathing was loud
in the emptiness

  quiana the tone was querulous now

  quiana the monster crooned and
swung about with sudden unexpected agil-
ity moving with smooth speed it van-
ished into the clouds of the background as
the girl had vanished for an eternity
dantan watched colored emptiness trying
to keep himself from trembling

  then he heard the voice again gentle no
longer but ringing like a bell with terrible
triumph quiana

  and out of the swirling clouds he saw
quiana break despair upon her face her
sheer garments streaming behind her after
her came the enemy it had unslung the
tube it wore over its shoulder and as it
lifted the weapon quiana swerved desper-
ately aside then from the coil of tubing
blind lightning ravened

  shattering the patternless obscurity the
blaze of its color burst out catching qui-
ana in a cone of expanding shifting bril-
liance and the despair in her eyes was
suddenly more than dantan could endure

  his hand struck out at the lever marked
door he swung it far over and the veil
that had masked the screen was gone he
vaulted up over its low threshold not see-
ing anything but the face and the terror of
quiana but it was not quianas name he
called as he leaped

  he lunged through the door onto soft
yielding substance that was unlike anything
he had ever felt underfoot before he
scarcely knew it he flung himself for-
ward fists clenched ready to drive futile
blows into the monstrous mask of the ene-
my it loomed over him like a tower tre-
mendous scarcely seen through the shelter
of his helmet-and then the glare of the
light-cone caught him

  it was tangible light it flung him back
with a piledriver punch that knocked the
breath from his body and the blow was
psychic as well as physical shaking and
reeling from the shock dantan shut his
eyes and fought forward as though against
a steady current too strong to breast very
long he felt quiana beside him caught
in the same dreadful stream and beyond
the source of the light the enemy stood up
in stark inhuman silhouette

  he never saw quianas world the light
was too blinding and yet in a subtle
the eyes of thar



sense it was not blinding to the eyes but
to the mind nor was it light dantan
thought with some sane part of his mind
too late he remembered quianas warning
that the world of zha was not mars or
earth that in zha even light was differ-
ent

  cold and heat mingled indescribably be-
wildering shook him hard and beyond
these were-other things the light from
the enemys weapon was not bom in dan-
tans universe and it had properties that
light should not have he felt bare emp-
tied a hollow shell through which radiance
streamed

  for suddenly every cell of his body was
an eye the glaring brilliance the intoler-
able vision beat at the foundations of his
sanity through him the glow went pour-
ing washing him nerves bone flesh brain
in floods of color that were not color sound
that was not sound vibration that was
spawned in the shaking hells of worlds be-
yond imagination

  it inundated him like a tide and for a
long long timeless while he stood helpless
in its surge moving within his body and
without it and within his mind and soul
as well the color of stars thundered in
his brain the crawling foulness of un-
speakable hues writhed along his nerves so
monstrously that he felt he could never
cleanse himself of that obscenity

  and nothing else existed-only the light
that was not light but blasphemy

  then it began to ebb    faded    grew
lesser and lesser until- beside him he
could see quiana now she was no longer
stumbling in the cone of light no longer
shuddering and wavering in its violence
but standing erect and facing the enemy
and from her eyes-something-poured

  steadily the cone of brilliance waned
but still its glittering shining foulness
poured through dantan he felt himself
weakening his senses fading as the tide of
dark horror mounted through his brain

  and covered him up with its blanketing
immensity

he was back in the laboratory lean-
ing against the wall and breathing in
deep shuddering draughts he did not
remember stumbling through the door
again but he was no longer in zha quiana
stood beside him here upon the martian

soil of the laboratory she was watching
him with a strange quizzical look in her
eyes as he slowly fought back to normal
his heart quieting by degrees his breath
becoming evener he felt drained ex-
hausted his emotions cleansed and purified
as though by baths of flame

  presently he reached for the clasp that
fastened his clumsy armor quiana put
out a quick hand shaking her head

  no she said and then stared at him
again for a long moment without speaking
finally i had not known-i did not think
this could be done another of my own
race-yes but you from mars-i would
not have believed that you could stand
against the enemy for a moment even
with your armor

  im from earth not mars and i
didnt stand long

  long enough she smiled faintly
you see now what happened we of zha
can destroy without weapons using only
the power inherent in our bodies those
like the enemy have a little of that power
too but they need mechanical devices to
amplify it and so when you diverted the
enemys attention and forced him to divide
his attack between us-the pressure upon
me was relieved and i could destroy him
but i would not have believed it possible
youre safe now dantan said with
no expression in voice or face

  yes i can return

  and you will

  of course i shall

  we are more alike than you had real-
ized 

  she looked up toward the colored curtain
of the screen that is true it is not the
complete truth dantan

  he said i love you-quiana this
time he called her by name

  neither of them moved minutes went
by silently

  quiana said as if she had not heard him
those who followed you are here i have
been listening to them for some time now
they are trying to break through the door
at the top of the shaft

  he took her hand in his gloved grasp
stay here or let me go back to zha with
you why not 

  you could not live there without your
armor

  then stay
	planet

  quiana looked away her eyes troubled
as dantan moved to slip off his helmet her
hand came up again to stop him

  dont

  why not

  for answer she rose beckoning for him
to follow she stepped across the thres-
hold into the shaft and swiftly began to
climb the pegs toward the surface and the
hammering of the redhelms up above
dantan at her gesture followed

  over her shoulder she said briefly

  we are of two very different worlds
watch-but be careful and she touched
the device that locked the oval door

  it slipped down and swung aside

dantan caught one swift glimpse of
redhelm heads dodging back to safe-
ty they did not know of course that he
was unarmed he reached up desperately
trying to pull quiana back but she slipped
aside and sprang lightly out of the shaft
into the cool gray light of the martian
morning

  forgetting her warning dantan pulled
himself up behind her but as his head
and shoulders emerged from the shaft he
stopped frozen for the redhelms were
falling there was no mark upon them
yet they fell   

  she did not stir even when the last man
had stiffened into rigid immobility then
dantan clambered up and without looking
at quiana went to the nearest body and
turned it over he could find no mark
yet the redhelm was dead

  that is wliy you had to wear the
armor she told him gently we are of
different worlds you and i

  he took her in his arms-and the soft
resilience of her was lost against the stiff-
ness of the protective suit he would never
even know how her body felt because of
the armor between them    he could not
even kiss her-again he had taken his
last kiss of the mouth so like quianas
mouth long years ago and he would never
kiss it again the barrier was too high
between them

  you cant go back he told her in a
rough uneven voice we are of the same
world no matter what-no matter how-
youre no stranger to me quiana

  she looked up at him with troubled eyes

stories

shaking her head regret in her voice

  do you think i dont know why you
fought for me dantan she asked in a
clear voice did you ever stop to wonder
why sanfel risked so much for me too

  he stared down at her his brain spin-
ning almost afraid to hear what she would
say next he did not want to hear but
her voice went on inexorably

  i cheated you dantan i cheated san-
fel yesterday-a thousand years ago my
need was very great you see-and our
ways are not yours i knew that no man
would fight for a stranger as i needed a
man to fight for me

  he held her tightly in gloved hands that
could feel only a firm body in their grasp
not what that body was really like nothing
about it except its firmness he caught his
breath to interrupt but she went  with
a rush

  i have no way of knowing how you see
me dantan she said relentlessly i
dont know how sanfel saw me to each
of you-because i needed your help-i
wore the shape to which you owed help
most i could reach into your minds deeply
enough for that-to mould a remembered
body for your eyes my own shape is-
different you will never know it she
sighed you were a brave man dantan
braver and stronger than i ever dreamed
an alien could be i wish- i wonder-
oh let me go let me go

  she whirled out of his grasp with sudden
vehemence turning her face away so that
he could not see her eyes without glanc-
ing at him again she bent over the shaft and
found the topmost pegs and in a moment
was gone

  dantan stood there waiting presently
he heard the muffled humming of a muted
bell as though sounding from another
world then he knew that there was no
one in the ancient laboratory beneath his
feet

  he shut the door carefully and scraped
soil over it he did not mark the place
the dim red spot of the sun was rising
above the canyon wall his face set dan-
tan began walking toward the distant cav-
ern where his aircar was hidden it was
many miles away but there was no one to
stop him now

  he did not look back

mr meek plays polo

by clifford  simak

mr meek was having his troubles first the educated bags wor-
ried him then the welfare worker tried to stop the ring rats
fend by enlisting his aid and now he was a drafted space-polo
pi ayer-a fortune bet on his ability at a game he had never

played in his cloistered life

illustration by ingels


he sign read

atomic motors repaired busted
plates patched up rocket tubes
relined wheeze in whis out

it added as an afterthought in shaky
inexpert lettering

we fix anything

mr oliver meek stared owlishly at the
sign which hung from an arm attached
to a metal standard sunk in solid rock a
second sign was wired to the standard just
below the metal arm but its legend was

faint almost illegible meek blinked at it
through thick-lensed spectacles finally de-
ciphered its scrawl

  ask about educated bugs

  a bit bewildered but determined not to
show it meek swung away from the sign-
post and gravely regarded the settlement
on the chart it was indicated by a fairly
sizeable dot but that was merely a matter
of comparison out saturn-way even the
tiniest outpost assumes importance far be-
yond its size

ulp ulped mr meek shakily


	planet

  the slab of rock was no more than five
miles across perhaps even less here in
its approximate center were two buildings
both of almost identical construction semi-
spherical and metal out here meek rea-
lized shelter was the thing architecture
merely for architectures sake was still a
long way off

  one of the buildings was the repair shop
which the sign advertised the other ac-
cording to the crudely painted legend
smeared above its entrance lock was the
saturn inn

  the rest of the rock was landing field
pure and simple blasters had leveled off
the humps and irregularities so spaceships
could sit down

  two ships now were on the field pulled
up close against the repair shop one
meek noticed belonged to the solar health
and welfare department the other to the
galactic pharmaceutical corporation the
galactic ship was a freighter ponderous
and slow it was here meek knew to
take on a cargo of radiation moss but
the other was a puzzler meek wrinkled
his brow and blinked his eyes trying to
figure out what a welfare ship would be
doing in this remote corner of the solar
system

  slowly and carefully meek clumped
toward the squat repair shop once or
twice he stumbled hoping fervently he
wouldnt get the feet of his cumbersome
spacesuit all tangled up the gravity was
slight next to non-existent and one who
wasnt used to it had to take things easy
and remember where he was

  behind him saturn filled a tenth of the
sky a yellow lemon-tinged ball streaked
here and there with faint crimson lines and
blotched with angry bright green patches

  to right and left glinted the whirling
twisting tumbling rocks that made up the
inner ring while arcing above the horizon
opposed to saturn was the spangled glis-
tening rainbows of the other rings

  like dewdrops in the black of space
meek mumbled to himself but he imme-
diately felt ashamed of himself for grow-
ing poetic this sector of space he knew
was not in the least poetic it was hard
and savage and as he thought about that
he hitched up his gun belt and struck out
with a firmer tread that almost upset him

stories

after that he tried to think of nothing
except keeping his two feet under him

  reaching the repair shops entrance lock
he braced himself solidly to keep his bal-
ance reached out and pressed a buzzer
swiftly the lock spun outward and a mo-
ment later meek had passed through the
entrance vault and stepped into the office

  a dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a
chair against a wall feet on the desk a
greasy cap pushed back on his head

  meek stamped his feet gratefully
pleased at feeling earth gravity under him
again he lifted the hinged helmet of his
suit back on his shoulders

  you are the gentleman who can fix
things  he asked the mechanic

the mechanic stared here was no
hell-for-leather freighter pilot no be-
whiskered roamer of the outer orbits
meeks hair was white and stuck out in
uncombed tufts in a dozen directions his
skin was pale his blue eyes looked wa-
tery behind the thick lenses that rode his
nose even the bulky spacesuit failed to
hide his stooped shoulders and slight
frame

  the mechanic said nothing

  meek tried again i saw the sign it
said you could fix anything sol   
the mechanic shook himself

  sure he agreed still slightly dazed
sure i can fix you up what you got
he swung his feet off the desk

i ran into a swarm of pebbles meek
confessed not much more than dust
really but the screen couldnt stop it all
he fumbled his hands self-consciously
awkward of me he said

  it happens to the best of them the
mechanic consoled saturn sweeps in
clouds of the stuff thicker than hell when
you reach the rings lots of ships pull
in with punctures wont take no time
meek cleared his throat uneasily im
afraid its more than a puncture a peb-
ble got into the instruments washed out
some of them

  the mechanic clucked sympathetically
youre lucky tough job to bring in a
ship without all the instruments must
have a honey of a navigator

  i havent got a navigator meek said
quietly

  the mechanic stared at him eyes pop-
mr meek plays polo



ping you mean you brought it in alone
no one with you

  meek gulped and nodded dead reck-
oning he said

  the mechanic glowed with sudden ad-
miration i dont know who you are
mister he declared but whoever you
are youre the best damn pilot that ever
took to space

  really im not said meek i havent
done much piloting you see up until just
awhile ago i never had left earth book-
keeper for lunar exports

  bookkeeper yelped the mechanic
how come a bookkeeper can handle a
ship like that 

  i learned it said meek

  you learned it

  sure from a book i saved my money
and i studied i always wanted to see
the solar system and here i am

  dazedly the mechanic took off his greasy
cap laid it carefully on the desk reached
out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall
hook

  afraid this job might take a while
he said especially if we have to wait
for parts have to get them in from titan
city why dont you go over to the inn
tell moe i sent you theyll treat you
right

  thank you said meek but theres
something else im wondering about there
was another sign out there something
about educated bugs

  oh them said the mechanic they
belong to gus hamilton maybe belong
aint the right word because they were on
the rock before gus took over anyhow
gus is mighty proud of them although at
times they sure run him ragged first
year they almost drove him loopy trying
to figure out what kind of game they were
playing

  game asked meek wondering if he
was being hoaxed

  sure game like checkers only it
aint not chess neither even worse
than that bugs dig themselves a batch of
holes then choose up sides and play for
hours about the time gus would think
he had it figured out theyd change the
rules and throw him off again

  that doesnt make sense protested
meek

  stranger declared the mechanic sol-

emnly there aint nothing about them
bugs that make sense gus rock is the
only one theyre on gus thinks maybe the
rock dont even belong to the solar system
thinks maybe its a hunk of stone from
some other solar system figures maybe
it crossed space somehow and was cap-
tured by saturn sucked into the ring
that would explain why its the only one
that has the bugs they come along with
it see

  this gus hamilton said meek id
like to see him where could i find him 
go over to the inn and wait around
advised the mechanic hell come in
sooner or later drops around regular
except when his rheumatism bothers him
to pick up a bundle of papers subscribes
to a daily paper he does only man out
here that does any reading but all he
reads is the sports section nuts about
sports gus is

ii

moe bartender at saturn inn leaned
his elbow on the bar and braced his
chin in an outspread palm his face wore
a melancholy hang-dog look moe liked
things fairly peaceable but now he saw
trouble coming in big batches

  lady he declared mournfully you
sure picked yourself a job the boys
around here dont take to being uplifted
and improved they aint worth it either
just ring-rats thats all they are

  henriettta perkins representative for
the public health and welfare department
of the solar government shuddered at his
suggestion of anything so low it didnt
yearn for betterment

  but those terrible feuds she protested
fighting just because they live in different
parts of the ring its natural they might
feel some rivalry but all this killing
surely they dont enjoy getting killed
sure they enjoy it declared moe
not being killed maybe    although
theyre willing to take a chance on that
not mny of them get killed in fact just
a few that get sort of careless but even if
some of them are killed you cant go mess-
ing around with that feud of theirs if
them boys out in sectors twenty-three
and thirty-seven didnt have their feud
theyd plain die of boredom they just
	planet

got to have somebody to fight with they
been fighting off and on for years

  but they could fight with something
besides guns said the welfare lady
a-smirk with righteousness thats why
im here to try to get them to turn their
natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly
and disturbing channels direct their ener-
gies into other activities

  like what asked moe fearing the
worst

  athletic events said miss perkins
tin shinny maybe suggested moe
trying to be sarcastic

  she missed the sarcasm or spelling
contests she said

  them fellow cant spell insisted moe
games of some sort then competi-
tive games

  now youre talking moe enthused
they take to games seven-toed pete
with the deuces wild

  the inner door of the entrance lock
grated open and a spacesuited figure limped
into the room the spacesuit visor snapped
up and a brush of grey whiskers spouted
into view

  it was gus hamilton

  he glared at moe what in tarnation
is all this foolishness he demanded got
your message i did and here i am but
it better be important

  he hobbled to the bar moe reached for
a bottle and shoved it toward him keeping
out of reach

  have some trouble he asked trying
to be casual

  trouble hell yes blustered gus
but i aint the only one thats going to
have trouble somebody sneaked over and
stole the injector out of my space crate
had to borrow hanks to get over here
but i know who it was there aint but
one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector
will fit

  bud craney said moe it was no
secret every man in the two sectors of
the ring knew just exactly what kind of
spacecraft the other had

   thats right said gus and im fixing
to go over into thirty-seven and yank bud
up by the roots

  he took a jolt of liquor yes sir i
sure aim to crucify him

  his eyes lighted on miss henrietta per-
kins

stories

   visitor  he asked

  shes from the government said moe
  revenuer 

  nope from the welfare outfit aims
to help you fellows out says there aint
no sense in you boys in twenty-three all
the time fighting with the gang from
thirty-seven

   gus stared in disbelief

  moe tried to be helpful she wants
you to play games

  gus strangled on his drink clawed for
air wiped his eyes

  so thats why you asked me over here
another of your danged peace parleys
come and talk things over you said so
i came

  theres something in what she says
defended moe you ring-rats been rip-
ping up space for a long time now time
you growed up and settled down youre
aiming on going over right now and pul-
verizing bud it wont do you any good
ill get a heap of satisfaction out of it
insisted gus and besides ill get my
injector back might even take a few
things off buds ship some of the parts
on mine are wearing kind of thin

  gus took another drink glowering at
miss perkins

  so the government sent you out to
make us respectable he said

  merely to help you mr hamilton
she declared to turn your hatreds into
healthy competition

  games eh said gus maybe you
got something after all maybe we could
fix up some kind of game 

  forget it gus warned moe if
youre thinking of energy guns at fifty
paces its out miss perkins wont stand
for anything like that

gus wiped his whiskers and looked
hurt nothing of the sort he de-
nied dang it you must think i aint got
no sportsmanship at all i was thinking of
a real sport a game they play back on
earth and mars read about it in my pa-
pers follow the teams i do always
wanted to see a game but never did
miss perkins beamed what game is
it mr hamilton

  space polo said gus

  why how wonderful simpered miss
perkins and you boys have the space-
ships to play it with

  moe looked alarmed miss perkins
he warned dont let him talk you into
it

  you shut your trap snapped gus
she wants us to play games dont she
well polo is a game a nice respectable
game played in the best society

  it wouldnt be no nice respectable game
the way you fellows would play it pre-
dicted moe it would turn into mass
murder wouldnt be one of you who
wouldnt be planning on getting even with
someone else once you got him in the
open

  miss perkins gasped why im sure
they wouldnt

  of course we wouldnt declared gus
solemn as an owl

  and that aint all said moe warming
to the subject those crates you guys got
wouldnt last out the first chukker most
of them would just naturally fall apart the
first sharp turn they made you cant
play polo in ships tied up with haywire
those broomsticks you ring-rats ride
around on are so used to second rate fuel
theyd split wide open first squirt of high
test stuff you gave them

  the inner locks grated open and a man
stepped through into the room

  youre prejudiced gus told moe
you just dont like space polo that is all
you aint got no blueblood in you well
leave it up to this man here well ask
his opinion of it

  the man flipped back his helmet re-
vealing a head thatched by white hair and
dominated by a pair of outsize spectables

  my opinion sir said oliver meek
seldom amounts to much

  all we want to know gus told him
is what you think of space polo

  space polo declared meek is a noble
game it requires expert piloting a fine
sense of timing and 

- there you see whooped gus tri-
umphantly

  i saw a game once meek volunteered
swell bellowed gus well have
you coach our team

  but protested meek but    but
oh mr hamilton exulted miss per-
kins you are so wonderful you think
of everything



hamilton squeaked meek

  sure said gus old gus hamilton
grow the finest dog-gone radiation moss
you ever clapped your eyes on

  then youre the gentleman who has
bugs said meek

  now look here warned gus you
watch what you say or ill hang one on
you

  he means your rock bugs moe ex-
plained hastily

  oh them said gus

  yes said meek im interested in
them id like to see them

  see them said gus mister you can
have them if you want them drove me
out of house and home they did theyre
dippy over metal any kind of metal but
alloys especially eat the stuff theyll
tromp you to death heading for a space-
ship got so i had to move over to an-
other rock to live tried to fight it out
with them but they whipped me pure and
simple moved out and let them have the
place after they started to eat my shack
right out from underneath my feet
meek looked crestfallen

cant get near them then he said
sure you can said gus why not
well a spacesuits metal and 
got that all fixed up said gus you
come back with me and ill let you have a
pair of stilts

  stilts

  yeah wooden stilts them danged
fool bugs dont know what wood is seem
to be scared of it sort of you can walk
right among them if you want to long
as youre walking on the stilts

  meek gulped he could imagine what
stilt walking would be like in a place where
gravity was no more than the faintest
whisper

ill

the bugs had dug a new set of holes
much after the manner of a chinese
checker board and now were settling down
into their respective places preparatory to
the start of another game

  for a mile or more across the flat sur-
face of the rock that was gus hamiltons
moss garden ran a string of such game-
boards each one different each one having

mr meek plays polo

                                     
	planet

served as the scene of a now-completed
game

  oliver meek cautiously wedged his stilts
into two pitted pockets of rock eased him-
self slowly and warily against the face of
a knob of stone that jutted from the sur-
face

  even in his youth meek remembered
he never had been any great shakes on
stilts here on this bucking weaving rock
with slick surfaces and practically no grav-
ity a man had to be an expert to handle
them meek knew now he was no expert
a half-dozen dents in his space armor was
ample proof of that

  comfortably braced against the upjutting
of stone meek dug into the pouch of his
space gear brought out a notebook and
stylus flipping the pages he stared
frowning at the diagrams that covered
them

  none of the diagrams made sense they
showed the patterns of three other boards
and the moves that had been made by the
bugs in playing out the game apparently
in each case the game had been finished
which meek knew should have meant
that some solution had been reached some
point won some advantage gained

  but so far as meek could see from study
of the diagrams there was not even a pur-
pose or a problem let alone a solution or
a point

  the whole thing was squirrely but
meek told himself it fitted in the whole
satumian system was wacky the rings
for example debris of a moon smashed
up by saturns pull  sweepings of space 
no one knew

  saturn itself for that matter a planet
that kept man at bay with deadly radia-
tions but radiations that while they kept
man at a distance at the same time served
man for here on the inner ring where
they had become so diluted that ordinary
space armor filtered them out they made
possible the medical magic of the famous
radiation moss

  one of the few forms of plant life found
in the cold of space the moss was nurtured
by those mysterious radiations planted
elsewhere on kindlier worlds it wilted and
refused to grow the radiations had been
analyzed meek knew and reproduced un-
der laboratory conditions but there still
was something missing some vital elusive

stories

factor that could not be analyzed under
the artificial radiation the moss still wilted
and died

  and because earth needed the moss to
cure a dozen maladies and because it would
grow nowhere else but here on th inner
ring men squatted on the crazy swirl of
spacial boulders that made up the ring
men like hamilton living on rocks that
bucked and heaved along their orbits like
chips riding the crest of a raging flood
men who endured loneliness dared death
when crunching orbits intersected or when
rickety spacecraft flared who went mad
with nothing to do with the mockery of
space before them

  meek shrugged his shoulders almost up-
setting himself

the bugs had started the game and
meek craned forward cautiously
watching eagerly stylus poised above the
notebook

  crawling clumsily the tiny insect-like
creatures moved about solemnly popping
in and out of holes

  if there were opposing sides    and
if it were a game thered have to be   
they didnt seem to alternate the moves
although meek admitted certain rules
and conditions which he had failed to note
or recognize might determine the number
and order of moves allowed each side

  suddenly there was confusion on the
board for a moment a half-dozen of
the bugs raced madly about as if seeking
the proper hole to occupy then as sud-
denly all movement had ceased and in
another moment they were on the move
again orderly again but retracing their
movements going back several plays be-
yond the point of confusion

  just as one would do when one made a
mistake working a mathematical problem
   going back to the point of error and
going on again from there

  well ill be   mr meek said

  meek stiffened and the stylus floated out
of his hand settled softly on the rock
below

  a mathematical problem

  his breath gurgled in his throat

  he knew it now he should have known
it all the time but the mechanic had
talked about the bugs playing games and so
had hamilton that had thrown him off
mr meek plays polo	

  games those bugs werent playing any
game they were solving mathematical
equations

  meek leaned forward to watch forget-
ting where he was one of the stilts slipped
out of position and meek felt himself start
to fall he dropped the notebook and
frantically clawed at empty space

  the other stilt went then and meek
found himself floating slowly downward
gravity weak but inexorable his strug-
gle to retain his balance had flung him
forward away from the face of the rock
and he was falling directly over the board
on which the bugs were arrayed

  he pawed and kicked at space but still
floated down course unchanged he struck
and bounced struck and bounced again

  on the fourth bounce he managed to
hook his fingers around a tiny projection
of the surface fighting desperately he
regained his feet

  something scurried across the face of
his helmet and he lifted his hand before
him it was covered with the bugs

  fumbling desperately he snapped on the
rocket motor of his suit shot out into
space heading for the rock where the
lights from the ports of hamiltons shack
blinked with the weaving of the rock

  oliver meek shut his eyes and groaned

   gus will give me hell for this he told
himself

gus shook the small wooden box
thoughtfully listening to the frantic
scurrying within it

   by rights he declared judiciously i
should take this over and dump it in buds
ship get even with him for swiping my
injector

  but you got the injector back meek
pointed out

  oh sure i got it back admitted gus
but it wasnt orthodox it wasnt just
getting your property back aint getting
even i never did have a chance to smack
bud in the snoot the way i should of
smacked him moe talked me into it he
was the one that had the idea the welfare
lady should go over and talk to bud she
must of laid it on thick too about how
we should settle down and behave ourselves
and all that otherwise bud never would
have given her that injector

  he shook his head dolefully this here

ring aint ever going to be the same again
if we dont watch out well find ourselves
being polite to one another

  that would be awful agreed meek

  wouldnt it though declared gus

  meek squinted his eyes and pounced on
the floor scrabbling on hands and knees
after a scurrying thing that twinkled in
the lamplight

  got him yelped meek scooping the
shining mote up in his hand

  gus inched the lid of the wooden box
open meek rose and popped the bug in-
side

  that makes twenty-eight of them said
meek

  i told you gus accused him that we
hadnt got them all you better take an-
other good look at your suit the danged
things burrow right into solid metal and
pull the hole in after them seems like
sneakiest cusses in the whole dang system
just like chiggers back on earth

  chiggers meek told him burrow into
a person to lay eggs

  maybe these things do too gus con-
tended

  the radio on the mantel blared a warn-
ing signal automatically tuning in on one
of the regular newscasts from titan city
out on saturns biggest moon

  the syrupy chamber of commerce voice
of the announcer was shaky with excite-
ment and pride

  next week he said the annual mar-
tian-earth football game will be played
at greater new york on earth but in
the earths newspapers tonight another
story has pushed even that famous classic
of the sporting world down into secondary
place

  he paused and took a deep breath and
his voice practically yodeled with delight

  the sporting event ladies and gentle-
men that is being talked up and down the
streets of earth tonight is one that will
be played here in our own saturnian sys-
tem a space polo game to be played
by two unknown pick-up amateur teams
down in the inner ring most of the men
have never played polo before few if
any of them have even seen a game there
may have been some of them who didnt
at first know what it was

  but theyre going to play it the men
who ride those bucking rocks that make
	planet

up the inner ring will go out into space
in their rickety ships and fight it out and
ladies and gentlemen when i say fight it
out i really mean fight it out for the
game it seems will be a sort of tourna-
ment the final battle in a feud that has
been going on in the ring for years no
one knows what started the feud it has
gotten so it really doesnt matter the only
thing that matters is that when men from
sector twenty-three meet those from sec-
tor thirty-seven the feud is taken up
again but that is at an end now in a
few days the feud will be played out to its
bitter end when the ships from the inner
ring go out into space to play that most
dangerous of all sports space polo for
the outcome of that game will decide for-
ever the supremacy of one of the two sec-
tors

meek rose from his chair opened his
mouth as if to speak but sank back
again when gus hissed at him and held a
finger to his lips for silence

  the teams are now in training went
on the newscaster the happy lilt in his
voice still undimmed and it is understood
that sector twenty-three has the advantage
at the start at least of having a polo ex-
pert as its coach just who this expert is
no one cn say several names have been
mentioned but 

  no no yelped meek struggling to
his feet but gus shushed him poking a
finger toward him and grinning like a
bearded imp

      bets are mounting high through-
out the entire saturnian system the an-
nouncer was saying but since little is
known about the teams the odds still are
even it is likely however that odds will
be demanded on the sector of thirty-seven
team on the basis of the story about the
expert coach

  the very audacity of such a game has
attracted solar-wide attention and special
fleets of ships will leave both earth and
mars within the next few days to bring
spectators to the game newsmen from
the inner worlds among them some of the
systems most famous sports writers are
already on their way

  originally intended to be no more than
a recreation project under the supervision
of the department of health and welfare

stories

the game has suddenly become a solar at-
traction the daily rocket back on earth
is offering a gigantic loving cup for the
winning team while the morning space-
ways has provided another loving cup only
slightly smaller to be presented the player
adjudged the most valuable to his team
we may have more to tell you about the
game before the newscast is over but in
the meantime we shall go on to other news
of solar int 

  meek leaped up he meant me he
whooped that wras me he meant when
he was talking about a famous coach
sure said gus he couldnt have
meant anyone else but you

   but im not a famous coach protested
meek im not even a coach at all i
never saw but one space polo game in all
my life i hardly know how its played
i just know you go up there in space and
bat a ball around im going to   
you aint going to do a blessed thing
said gus you aint skipping out on us
youre staying right here and give us all
the fine pointers of the game maybe you
aint as hot as the newscaster made out but
youre a dang sight better than anyone else
around here at least you seen a game
once and thats more than any of the rest
of us have

  but i  

  i dont know whats the matter with
you declared gus youre just pretend-
ing you dont know anything about polo
thats all maybe youre a fugitive from
justice maybe thats why youre so anx-
ious to make a getaway only reason you
stopped at all was because your ship got
stoved up

   im no fugitive declared meek draw-
ing himself up im just a bookkeeper
out to see the system

   forget it said gus forget it no-
body around heres going to give you away
if they even so much as peep ill plain
paralyze them so youre a bookkeeper
thats good enough for me just let any-
one say you aint a bookkeeper and see
what happens to him

   meek opened his mouth to speak closed
it again what was the use  here he was
stuck again just like back on juno when
that preacher had thought he was a gun-
man and talked him into taking over the
job of cleaning up the town only this
mr meek plays polo	

time it was a space polo game and he knew
even less about space polo than he did
about being a lawman

  gus rose and limped slowly across the
room ponderously he hauled a red ban-
danna out of his back pocket and carefully
dusted off the one uncrowded space on the
mantel shelf between the alarm clock and
the tarnished silver model of a rocket ship

  yes sir he said shell look right
pretty there

  he backed away and stared at the place
on the shelf

  i can almost see her now he said
glinting in the lamplight something to
keep me company something to look at
when i get lonesome

  what are you talking about de-
manded meek

  that there cup the radio was talking
about said gus the one for the most
valuable team member

  meek stammered but    but   
  im going to win her gus declared

iv

saturn inn bulged every room
was crowded with half a dozen to the
cubicle sleeping in relays those who
couldnt find anywhere else to sleep spread
blankets in the narrow corridors or dozed
off in chairs or slept on the barroom floor
a few of them got stepped on

  titan citys junior chamber of com-
merce had done what it could to help the
situation out but the notice had been
short a half-dozen nearby rocks which had
been hastily leveled off for parking space
now were jammed with hundreds of space
vehicles ranging from the nifty two man
job owned by billy jones sports editor of
the daily rocket to the huge excursion
liners sent out by the three big transport
companies a few hastily-erected shelters
helped out to some extent but none of
these shelters had a bar and were mostly
untenanted

  moe the bartender at the inn harried
with too many customers droopy with lack
of sleep saw oliver meek bobbing around
in the crowd that surged against the bar
much after the manner of a cork caught
in a raging whirlpool he reached out a
hand and dragged meek against the bar

-planet stories-fall

cant you do something to stop it
meek blinked at him stop what
this game said moe its awful
mr meek honestly the crowd has got
the fellers so worked up its apt to be
mass murder

  i know it meek agreed but you
cant stop it now the junior chamber of
commerce would take the hide off anyone
who even said he would like to see it
stopped its more publicity than saturn
has gotten since the first expeditions were
lost here

  i dont like it declared moe stolidly
i dont like it either meek confessed
gus and those other fellows on his team
think im an expert i told them what
i knew about space polo but it wasnt
much trouble is they think its everything
there is to know they figure theyre a
cinch to win and they got their shirts bet
on the game if they lose theyll more
than likely space-walk me

  fingers tapped meeks shoulders and he
twisted around a red face loomed above
him a cigarette drooping from the corner
of its lips

  hear you say you was coaching the
twenty-three bunch

  meek gulped

  billy jones thats me said the lips
with the cigarette best damn sports
writer ever pounded keys been trying to
find out who you was nobody else knows
treat you right

  you must be wrong said meek
never wrong insisted jones nose
for news smell it out like this sniff
sniff

  his nose crinkled in imitation of a
bloodhound but his face didnt change
otherwise the cigarette still dangled
pouring smoke into a watery left eye

  heard the guy call you meek said
jones name sounds familiar some-
thing about juno wasnt it rounded up
a bunch of crooksi found a space monster
of some sort

  another hand gripped meek by the
shoulder and literally jerked him around

  so youre the guy yelped the owner
of the hand i been looking for you ive
a good notion to smack you in the puss
now bud yelled moe in mounting
fear you leave him alone he aint done
a thing
	planet

  meek gaped at the angry face of the
hulking man who still had his shoulder in
the grip of a monstrous paw

  bud craney the ring-rat that had
stolen gus injector the captain of the
thirty-seven team

  if there was room craney grated
id wipe up the floor vith you but since
there aint im just plain going to hammer
you down about halfway into it

  but he aint done nothing shrilled
moe

  hes an outsider aint he demanded
craney what business he got coming in
here and messing around with things
im not messing around with things
mr craney meek declared trying to be
dignified about it but it was hard to be
dignified with someone lifting one by the
shoulder so ones toes just barely touched
the floor

  all thats the matter writh you in-
sisted the dangling meek is that you
know gus and his men will give you a
whipping theyd done it anyhow i
havent helped them much i havent
helped them hardly at all

  craney howled in rage why    you
   you 

  and then oliver meek did one of those
things no one ever expected him to do
least of all himself

  ill bet you my spaceship he said
against anything you got

  astonished craney opened his hand and
let him down on the floor

  youll what he roared

  ill bet you my spaceship said meek
the madness still upon him that twenty-
three will beat you

  he rubbed it in ill even give you
odds

craney gasped and sputtered i dont
want any odds he yelped ill take it
even my moss patch against your ship
someone was calling meeks name in the
crowd

  mr meek mr ivjeek

  here said meek

  what about that story  demanded
billy jones but meek didnt hear him

  a man was tearing his way through the
crowd it was one of the men from
twenty-three

  mr meek he panted you got to

stories

come right away its gus hes all tan-
gled up with rheumatiz

gus stared up with anguished eyes at
meek

  it sneaked up on me while i slept he
squeaked laid off of me for years until
just now limped once in a while of
course and got a few twinges now and
then but that was all never had me tied
up like this since i left earth one of the
reasons i never did go back to earth
space is good climate for rheumatiz cold
but dry no moisture to get into your
bones

  meek looked around at the huddled men
saw the worry that was etched upon their
faces

  get a hot water bottle he told one of
them

  hell said russ jensen a hulking
framed spaceman there aint no such a
thing as a hot water bottle nearer than
titan city

  an electric pad then

  jensen shook his head no pads
neither only thing we can do is pour
whiskey down him and if we pour enough
down him to cure the rheumatiz well get
him drunk and he wont be  more able
to play in that game than he is right now
meeks weak eyes blinked behind his
glasses staring at gus

  well lose sure if gus cant play said
jensen and me with everything i got bet
on our team

  another man spoke up meek could
play in gus place

  nope he couldnt declared jensen
the rats from thirty-seven wouldnt
stand for it

  they couldnt do a thing about it de-
clared the other man meeks been here
six weeks today that makes him a resi-
dent six earth weeks the law says and
all that time hes been in sector twenty-
three they wouldnt have a leg to stand
on they might squawk but they couldnt
make it stick

  youre certain of that demanded jen-
sen

  dead certain said the other

  meek saw them looking at him felt a
queasy feeling steal into his stomach
mr meek plays polo	

  i couldnt he told them i couldnt
doit i    i   

  you go right ahead oliver said gus
i wanted to play of course sort of set
my heart on that cup had the mantel
picce all dusted off for it but if i cant
play there aint another soul id rather
have play in my place than you

  but i dont know a thing about polo
protested meek

  you taught it to us didnt you bel-
lowed jensen you pretended like you
knew everything there was to know

  but i dont insisted meek you
wouldnt let me explain you kept telling
me all the time what a swell coach i was
and when i tried to argue with you and tell
you that i wasnt you yelled me down i
never saw more than one game in all my
life and the only reason i saw it then was
because i found the ticket it was on the
sidewalk and i picked it up somebody
had dropped it

  so you been stringing us along yelped
jensen you been making fools of us
how do we know but you showed us
wrong you been giving us the wrong
dope

  he advanced on meek and meek backed
against the wall

  jensen lifted his fist held it in front of
him as if he were weighing it

  i ought to bop you one he decided
all of us had ought to bop you one
every danged man in this here room has
got his shirt bet on the game because we
figured we couldnt lose with a coach like
you

  so have i said meek but it wasnt
until he said it that he really realized he
did have his shirt bet on twenty-three his
spaceship it wasnt all he had of course
but it was the thing that was nearest to his
heart    the thing he had slaved for
thirty years to buy

  he suddenly remembered those years
now years of bending over account books
in the dingy office back on earth watching
other men go out in space longing to go
himself counting pennies so that he could
go spending only a dime for lunch and
eating crackers and cheese instead of going
out for dinner in the evening piling up
the dollars slowly through the years   
dollars to buy the ship that now stood out

on the field all damage repaired sitting
poised for space

  but if thirty-seven won it wouldnt be
his any longer it would be craneys hed
j ust made a bet with craney and there were
plenty of witnesses to back it up

  well demanded jensen

  i will play said meek

  and you really know about the game
you wasnt kidding us

  meek looked at the men before him and
the expression on their faces shaped his
answer

  he gulped    gulped again then
slowly nodded

  sure i know about it he lied

  they didnt look quite satisfied

  he glanced around but there was no way
of escape he faced them again back
pressed against the wall

  he tried to make his voice light and
breezy but he couldnt quite keep out the
croak

  havent played it much in the last few
years he said but back when i was a
kid i was a ten-goal man

  they were satisfied at that

v

hunched behind the controls meek

slowly circled gus crate waiting for
the signal half fearful of what would hap-
pen when it came

  glancing to left and right he could see
the other ships of sector twenty-three
slowly circling too red identification lights
strung along their hulls

  ten miles away a gigantic glowing ball
danced in the middle of the space-field
bobbing around like a jigging lantern and
beyond it were the circling blue lights of
the thirty-seven team and beyond them
the glowing green space-buoys that marked
the thirty-seven goal line

  meek bent an attentive ear to the tick-
ing of the motor listening intently for the
alien click he had detected a moment be-
fore gus ship to tell the truth was none
too good it might have been a good ship
once but now it was worn out it was
sluggish and slow to respond to the con-
trols it had a dozen little tricks that kept
one on the jump it had followed space
trails too long had plumped down to too
	planet

many bumpy landings in the maelstrom of
the belt

  meek sighed gustily it would have
been different if they had let him take his
own ship but it was only on the condition
that he use gus ship that thirty-seven had
agreed to let him play at all they had
raised a fuss about it but twenty-three
had the law squarely on its side

  he stole a glance toward the sidelines
and saw hundreds of slowly cruising ships
ships crammed with spectators out to
watch the game radio ships that would
beam a play by play description to be chan-
neled to every radio station throughout
the solar system newsreel ships that
would film the clash of opposing craft
ships filled with newsmen who would
transmit reams of copy back to earth and
mars

  looking at them meek shuddered

  how in the world had he ever let him-
self get into a thing like this he was
out to see the solar system not to play a
polo game    especially a polo game
he didnt want to play

  it had been the bugs of course if it
hadnt been for the bugs gus never would
have had the chance to talk him into that
coaching business

  he should have spoken out of course
told them flat out that he didnt knw a
thing about polo made them understand
he wasnt going to have a thing to do with
this silly scheme but they had shouted
at him and laughed at him and bullied him
been nice to him too that was the big-
gest trouble he was a sucker he knew
for anyone who was nice to him not
many people had been

 maybe he should have gone to miss
henrietta perkins and explained she
might have listened and understood al-
though he wasnt any too sure about that
she probably had plenty to do with start-
ing the publicity rolling after all it was
her job to make a showing on the jobs she
did

  if it hadnt been for gus dusting off the
place on the mantelpiece if it hadnt
been for the titan city junior chamber
of commerce if it hadnt been for all the
ballyhoo about the mystery coach

  but more especially if hed kept his fool
mouth shut and not made that bet with
craney

stories

meek groaned and tried to remember
the few things he did know about
polo and he couldnt think of a single
thing not even some of the things he had
made up and told the boys

  suddenly a rocket flared from the ref-
erees ship and with a jerk meek hauled
back the throttle the ship gurgled and
stuttered and for a moment heart in his
throat meek thought it was going to blow
up right then and there

  but it didnt it gathered itself together
and leaped forcing meek hard against the
chair snapping back his head dazed he
reached out for the repulsor trigger

  ahead the glowing ball bounced and
quivered jumped this way and that as the
ships spun in a mad melee with repulsor
beams whipping out like stabbing knives

  two of the ships crashed and fell apart
like matchboxes a third trying a sharp
turn above the field of play came unstuck
and strewed itself across fifty miles of
space

  substitute ships dashed in from the side-
lines signalled by the referees blinking
light rescue ships streaked out to pick
up the players salvage ships to clear away
the pieces

  for a fleeting moment meek got the
bobbing sphere in the cross-hairs arid
squeezed the trigger the ball jumped as
if someone had smacked it with his fist
sailed across the field

  fighting to bring the ship around meek
yelled in fury at its slowness desperately
pouring on the juice he watched with
agony as a blue-lighted ship streamed down
across the void heading for the ball

  the ship groaned in every joint pro-
testing and twisting as if in agony as meek
forced it around suddenly there was a
snap and the sudden swoosh of escaping
air startled meek looked up bare ribs
stood out against star-spangled space a
plate had been ripped oft 

  face strained behind the visor of his
spacesuit hunched over the controls he
waited for the rest of the plates to go by
some miracle they hung on one worked
loose and flapped weirdly as the ship shiv-
ered in the turn

  but the turn had taken too long and
meek was too late the blue-lamped ship
already had the ball was streaking for the
goal line jensen somehow had had sense
mr meek plays polo	

enough to refuse to be sucked out goalie
position and now he charged in to inter-
cept

  but he muffed his chance he dived
in too fast and missed with his repulsor
beam by a mile at least the ball sailed
over the lighted buoys and the first chuk-
ker was over with thirty-seven leading by
one score

  the ships lined up again

  the rockct flared from the starters ship
and the ships plunged out one of thirty-
sevens ships began to lose things plates
broke loose and fell away a rocket snapped
its moorings and sailed off at a tangent
spouting gouts of flame the structural ribs
came off and strewed themselves along
like spilling toothpicks

  battered by repulsor beams the ball
suddenly bounced upward and meek trail-
ing the field waiting for just such a chance
played a savage tune on the tube controls

  the ship responded with a snap execut-
ing a half roll and a hairpin turn that shook
the breath from meek two more plates
tore off in the turn but the ship plowed
on now the ball was dead ahead and
meek gave it the works the beam hit
squarely and meek followed through the
second chukker was over and the score was
tied

  not until he was curving back above the
thirty-seven goal line did meek have time
to wonder what had happend to the ship
it was sluggish no longer it was full of
zip almost like driving his own sleek
craft almost as if the ship knew where
he wanted it to go and went there

  a hint of motion on the instrument panel
caught his eye and he bent close to see
what it was he stiffened the panel
seemed to be alive seemed to be crawling

  he bent closer and froze it was crawl-
ing there was no doubt of that crawl-
ing with rock-bugs

breath whistling between his teeth
meek ducked his head under the
panel every wire every control was
oozing bugs

  for a moment he sat paralyzed by the
thoughts that flickered through his brain

  gus he knew would have his scalp for
this because he was the one that had
brought the bugs over to the rock where
gus lived and kept the ship they thought

of course they had caught all of them that
was on his suit but now it was clear they
hadnt some of them must have gotten
away and found the ship they would have
made straight for it of course because of
the alloys that were in it why bother with
a spacesuit or anythihg else when there
was a ship around

  only there were too many of them
there were thousands in the instrument
panel and other thousands in the controls
and he couldnt have brought back that
many not if hed hauled them back in
pails

  what was it gus had said about them
burrowing into metal just like chiggers
burrow into human flesh

  chiggers attacked humans to lay their
eggs maybe    maybe   

  a battalion of the bugs trooped across
the face of an indicator and meek saw they
were smaller than the ones he had seen
back on gus rock

  there was no doubt about it they were
young bugs bugs that has just hatched
out thousands of them    millions of
them maybe and they wouldnt be in
the instruments and controls alone but all
through the ship theyd be in the motors
and the firing mechanisms  all the
places where the best alloys were used

  meek wrung his hands watching them
play tag across the panel if theyd had
to hatch why couldnt they have waited
just until the game was over anyhow that
would have been all hed asked but they
hadnt and here he was with a couple of
million bugs or so right smack in his lap

  the rocket flared again and the ships
shot out

  bitterness chewing at him meek flung
the ship out savagely what did it matter
what happened now gus would take the
hide off him rheumatism or no rheuma-
tism as soon as he found out about the
bugs

  for a wild moment he hoped he would
crack up maybe the ship would fall apart
like some of the others had like the old
one hoss shay the poet had written about
centuries ago the ship had lost so many
plates that even now it was like flying a
space-going box-kite

  suddenly a ship loomed directly ahead
diving from the zenith meek forgetting
his half-formed hope of a crackup a sec-
	planet

ond before froze in terror but his fingers
acted by pure instinct stabbing at keys
although in the petrified second that
seemed half an eternity meek knew the
ships would crash before he even touched
the keys and even as he thought it the
ship ducked in a nerve-rending jerk and
they were skinning past hulls almost touch-
ing another jerk and more plates gone
and there was the ball directly ahead with
the repulsor beam already licking out

  meeks jaw fell and a chill through his
body and he couldnt move a muscle for
he hadnt even touched the trigger and yet
the repulsor beam was flaring out driving
the ball ahead of it while the ship twisted
and squirmed its way through a mass of
fighting craft

  hands dangling limply at his side meek
gaped in terror and disbelief he wasnt
touching the controls and yet the ship was
like a thing bewitched a split second later
the ball was over the goal and the ship was
curving back repulsor beam snapped off

  its the bugs meek whispered to him-
self lips scarcely moving the bugs have
taken over

  the craft he was riding he knew was
no longer just a ship but a collection of
rock bugs bugs that could work out
mathematical equations and now were
playing polo

  for what was polo anyhow except a
mathematical equation a problem of using
certain points of force at certain points in
space to arrive at a predetermined end
back on gus rock the bugs had worked as
a unit to solve equations    and the new
hatch in the ship was working as a unit
too to solve another kind of problem   
the problem of taking a certain ball to a
certain point despite certain variable and
random factors in the form of opposing
spaceships

  tentatively half fearfully meek stabbed
cautiously at a key which should have
turned the ship the ship didnt turn
meek snatched his hand away as if the key
had burned his finger

back on the line the ship wheeled into
position of its own accord and a mo-
ment later was off again meek clung to
his chair with shaking hands there was
he knew no use of even pretending he was
trying to operate the ship there was just

stories

one thing that he was glad of no one
could see him sitting there doing nothing

  but the time would come    and soon
   when he would have to do something
for he couldnt let the ship return to the
ring to do that would be to infest the
other ships parked there spread the bugs
throughout the solar system and those
bugs definitely were something the solar
system cold get along without

  the ship shuddered and twisted weav-
ing its way through the pack of players
more plates ripped loose glancing up
meek could see the glory of saturn through
the gleaming ribs

  then the ball was over the line and
meeks team mates were shrieking at him
over the radio in his spacesuit    happy
glee-filled yells of triumph he didnt an-
swer he was too busy ripping out the
control wires but it didnt help even
while he was doing it the ship went on
unhampered and piled up another score

  apparently the bugs didnt need the
controls to make the ship do what they
wanted more than likely they were in
control of the firing mechanism at its very
source maybe and the thought curled
the hair on meeks neck they were the
firing mechanism maybe they had in-
tegrated themselves with the very structure
of the entire mechanism of the ship that
would make the ship alive a living chunk
of machinery that paid no attention to the
man who sat at the controls

  meanwhile the ship made another
goal   

  there was a way to stop the bugs   
only one way    but it was dangerous

  but probably not half as dangerous
meek told himself as gus or the junior
chamber or the thirty-seven team   
especially the thirty-seven team  if
any of them found out what was going on

  he found a wrench and crawled back
along the shivering ship

  working in a frenzy of fear and need
for haste meek took off the plate that
sealed the housing of the rear rocket as-
sembly breath hissing in his throat he
fought the burrs that anchored the tubes
there were a lot of them and they didnt
come off easily rockets had to be
anchored securely    securely enough so
the blast of atomic fire within their cham-
bers wouldnt rip them free
iff it meek plays polo	

meanwhile the ship piled up the score
loose burrs rolled and danced along
the floor and meek knew the ship was in the
thick of play again then they were
curving back another goal

  suddenly the rocket assembly shook a
little began to vibrate wielding the
wrench like a madman knowing he had
seconds at the most meek spun two or
three more bolts then dropped the wrench
and ran leaping for a hole from which
a plate had been torn he caught a rib
swung with every ounce of power he had
launching himself into space

  his right hand fumbled for the switch
of the suits rocket motor found it snapped
it on to full acceleration something
seemed to hit him on the head and he sailed
into the depths of blackness

vi

billy jones sat is the office of the
repair shop cigarette dangling from
his lip pouring smoke into his watery eye

  never saw anything like it in my life
he declared how he made that ship go at
all with half the plates ripped off is way
beyond me

  the dungareed mechanic sighted along
the toes of his shoes planted comfortably
on the desk

  let me tell you mister he declared
the solar system never has known a pilot
like him    never will again he brought
his ship down here with the instruments
knocked out dead reckoning

  wrote a great piece about him billy
said how he died in the best tradition
of space stuff like that the readers
will eat it up the way that ship let go
he didnt have a chance seemed to go
out of control all at once and went weaving
and bucking almost into saturn then
blooey    thats the end of it one big
splash of flame

  the mechanic squinted carefully at his
toes theyre still out there messing
around he said but theyll never find
him when that ship blew up he was
scattered halfway out to pluto

  the inner lock swung open ponderously
and a spacesuited figure stepped in

 they waited while he snapped back his
 helmet

 good evening gentlemen said oliver
 meek

 they stared slack-jawed

 jones was the first to recover but it
 cant be you your ship  it exploded i
 i know said meek i got out just
 before it went turned on my suit rocket
 full blast knocked me out by the time
 i come to i was halfway out to the second
 ring took me awhile to get back

 he turned to the mechanic maybe
 you have a second hand suit you would
 sell me i have to get rid of this one has
 some bugs in it

 bugs oh yes i see you mean
 somethings wrong with it

 thats it said meek somethings
 wrong with it

 i got one ill let you have free for
 nothing said the mechanic boy that
 was a swell game you played

 could i have the suit now asked
 meek im in a hurry to get away

 jones bounced to his feet but you
 cant leave why they think youre dead
 theyre out looking for you and you
 won the cup    the cup as the most valu-
 able team member

 i just cant stay said meek he shuf-
 fled his feet uneasily got places to go
 things to see stayed too long already
 but the cup   

 tell gus i won the cup for him tell
 him to put it on that mantelpiece in the
 place he dusted off for it

 meeks blue eyes shone queerly behind
 his glasses tell him maybe hell think
 of me sometimes when he looks at it

 the mechanic brought the suit meek
 bundled it under his arm started for the
 lock

 then turned back

 maybe you gentlemen  

 yes said jones

 maybe you can tell me how many goals
 i made i lost count you see

 you made nine said jones

 meek shook his head must be getting
 old he said when i was a kid i was
 a ten goal man

 then he was gone the lock swinging
 shut behind him
the citadel of death

by carl selwyn

vulcan held the weirdest secret of the ages one of eternal life
that rick norman had to find to save his friend from death but
it held another secret too-one that was so vicious even know-
ing it meant rick norman was doomed

illustration by elias


keren whirled and lunged at the screaming mercurian

ttts too risky for you to go
alone johnny rick norman said
wait till i get through showing
the senator around the mine then if you
still think your gravity gadget can get us
to vulcan against sun drag well go look
into this fountain of youth business to-
gether he knew johnny wasnt paying
any attention to his argument however
and as he talked his big fingers were busy
under the table unfolding the wax paper

from the two small green capsules-mar-
tian knockout drops two of them would
be enough to put johnny out for a week

  johnny gordons black hair gleamed in
the nightclubs orange light when he
laughed his tanned face was surprisingly
boyish-surprising because his name was
linked with adventure in headlines on many
planets you think the patrols going to
be laying for me off mercury he laughed
well id like a little excitement


	planet

  norman dropped the wax paper on the
floor and hid the capsules in his big palm
johnny was right-they wouldve had a
lot more fun if theyd never bumped into
that dead comet off neptune but how
were they to know that cold hunk of drift
metal would turn out to be solid platinum
that was three years ago and now their
income was a number like the circumference
of jupiter in feet to him it was a devil
of a responsibility to johnny it was just
plain boring

  but he couldnt let johnny get himself
killed running away from a full dress suit
okay he said faking resignation you
win roughly handsome normans hell
or high water smile was as much a part
of him as his long legs he filled their
glasses as the orchestra started moaning
martian moon dropped the capsules into
the bubbly green wine in johnnys glass
heres to the twenty-first century ponce
de leon he smiled raising his glass

  johnny reached across the table and
picked up the bottle heres to the bore-
dom of a million dollars he said and
drank the toast straight from the bottle
he wiped his chin grinning you ought
to know you cant catch me on a martian
mickey they stop the bubbles

  as norman stared at the suddenly life-
less wine in johnnys glass he realized
there was only one thing left to do he
knew a couple of boys who were pretty
handy with a blackjack and he knew an
old hunting lodge in the adirondacks where
they could lock johnny up for a week

the next morning as norman was
packing his bags one of his boys
appeared at the door his eyes were black
and swollen embarrassed he held out an
envelope norman tore it open

  youll find your other playmate locked
in my bathroom ill bring you a jugfidl of
the fountain of youth the note was
written in johnnys careless scrawl nor-
man flicked the ampliphone button in the
little table beside his bed

  interstellar spaceport he ordered the
invisible telemike as he pulled a handful
of bills from his pocket and shoved them
at the battered gentleman in the door
thanks for trying spike go kick
johnnys bathroom door down joes
locked up in there-

stories

  spaceport the wall speaker said

  john gordon norman asked waving
spike out has he been there

  mr gordon took off half an hour ago
sir said the ampliphone for mercury

  thanks   as norman clicked off
the receiver premonition crept over him
like a shadow his hand moved to the re-
ceiver again-to call for a ship and follow
johnny then the ampliphone buzzed
under his hand

  it was the senator he was waiting at
the capital

  as he started throwing shirts into his
bag norman knew it was against his bet-
ter judgment but after all johnny could
take care of himself spikes hamburger
face proved that

  it was with this thought that he picked
up the plump senator and left for the
platinum comet when the sleek private
cruiser nosed into the little worlds arti-
ficial air three days later the mine foreman
met them with a radiogram in his hand

  silently cursing the static that had inter-
fered with space reception on the way over
cold fear clutched at normans heart as
he read the message the platinums
yours he told the astonished mine fore-
man show the senator around

  as their bewildered faces stared after
him he took off for earth again immedi-
ately

  the trip back was maddening and he
ignored all speed laws as he roared full-
throttle into the bright mountain range
that was new york city newsboys were
still shouting the headlines on the street
when he reached the hospital

 fountain of youth in
tragic reverse john gordon
found in drifting space
boat invention missing

  norman shoved a bill at the driver
jumped out of the taxi and ran up the hos-
pital steps the girl at the desk recog-
nized him room  mr norman dr
smyth is expecting you

  he hurried to the elevator where a mob
of reporters were also waiting what
do you think happened to him mr nor-
man do you think he reached vulcan
what do you think became of his cruiser
with the anti-gravity invention

  later boys norman said his familiar
the citadel of death	

smile a little shaky now ive got to see
johnny first

  a black-bearded doctor opened the door
at his knock from within the room came
an odd babbling sound like a child talking
to itself looking over the doctors shoul-
der norman saw an old man lying on the
white bed he stepped past the doctor
into the room

  propped up on pillows the old man lay
there like an ancient withered mummy
only his skull-like eyes were alive yellow
and wild as he stared at his disfigured
hands his hands were more like paws for
each finger and thumb had been severed
close to the palm the scars well-healed as if
the mutilation had happened years ago

  they found his pilots license in his
pocket the doctor said and the blood
test proved his identity

  no norman said turning back to the
bed this is impossible

  ive given him a thorough examination
the doctor said he has every condition
of advanced senility we cant say how
he lost his fingers nor how they healed so
quickly we only know this his voice
dropped to a whisper that he is very near
death of old age 

  normans eyes were damp through
the window the afternoon sun lined the
old mans sunken cheeks with deep shadows
gleamed on his thin white hair his
voice was a high-pitched quaver my
hands    my hands   

norman sprang to the bed knelt be-
side the ancient creature johnny its
me rick tell me what happened
but the old man stared at him blankly
then looked back down at his hands again

  norman got to his feet slowly okay
johnny he said through tight lips but
ill find out what happened to you and
i think i know where to start

  twenty minutes later however the
pudgy gorig sade ambassador from mer-
cury could offer little information he
leaned back in his gilded chair and raised
his hand toward the sunset at the window
his right hand was artificial an electric
member in flesh-like plastic behind that
sun he said a slight smile on his thick
lips lies a planet without a human foot-
print within the mercurian zone of pro-
tection vulcan is closely guarded by the
mercurian zone patrol vulcan is a death

trap-too close in the suns gravitational
field we cannot answer to the safety of
those who slip past the patrol and enter the
whirlpool

  norman smiled as a fighter smiles at his
opponent when he comes out at the bell
thats enough of that line sade when
did your patrol last see john gordon
they were waiting for him off mercury
youve had your paid killers after him
ever since he refused to sell out to you
now his gravitational counteractive turns
up missing it would have meant a lot to
mercury-or to you rather since your
rotten politics owns the place

  sade got to his feet like a disturbed bull
get out his electric hand hummed as
he raised it toward the door i shall see
the secretary of state about your insult
normans left hand shot out like a
striking snake clutched the ambassadors
collar and dragged him out of his chair

  okay sade he smiled but theres
one thing maybe you dont know johnny
built two ships a smaller one before he
equipped the cruiser he left in im taking
that ship to try to reach vulcan johnnys
spectroscope proved a lot about this foun-
tain of youth business and now its the
only chance to save his life anyway ill
find out what happened to him and if you
had anything to do with it im going to tear
your yellow throat out

  he slammed the sputtering ambassador
back into his chair and left the office now
sade would forget the secretary of state
and order his patrol to be waiting for him
a burst of flame in desolate space and who
would know

ten minutes outside the mercurian
zone of protection norman wel-
comed the misty glow as live nebulae
engulfed the transparent dome surround-
ing him it brightened the monotonous
blue light in the pilot room and erased
his lonely reflection in the foot - thick
thermo-glass that darkened the white-hot
glare of space ahead

  traveling near mercury was like walk-
ing a tight rope a few degrees off course
and the delicate balance between worlds
would totter-jerk him away to a charred
plunge into the sun also sades wolves
might appear any moment now but hed
get through them he thought slapping the
	planet

  trigger grip of his panel guns the picture
  of johnny back there in the hospital how-
  ever was an ache in his throat that dulled
  his excitement-an excitement reminiscent
  of hundreds of tight spots theyd squeezed
  through together before theyd struck it
  right and traded adventure for tea cups
  helpless crazed eighty years old before
  his time-why hadnt johnny waited
  but he was bull-headed and bored anxious
  to prove what his spectroscope hinted-that
  vulcan close in the arms of the mother
  sun was a spawning place for life itself
  ponce de leon again in    

    grinding out his cigarette norman
  glanced at the chart in his lap eyed the
  circle that was vulcan a white circle-
  unexplored deep in the whirlpool of the
  suns gravitation it had lured countless
  ships to a hurtling destruction until a
  trade-wise mercury placed guards around
  the area and its siren world

    norman glanced up from his musings
  as the filters blue light darkened the room
  again the nebulae outside had vanished
  almost human that glass the hotter it
  became outside the darker the glass be-
  came-not only shielding the pilots eyes
  but perfectly maintaining the insulation of
  the control room suddenly he jerked his
  head up chilled as he stared at the mir-
  rored wall in front of him

    reflected in the glass a ghostly figure
  stood behind him in the galley door

    hello

    it was a feminine voice slowly nor-
  man swung his long legs around and stared
  at the girl too astonished to speak she
  was just a kid about fifteen years old
  wearing baggy white coveralls a mop
  of honey-colored hair framed her pert
  freckled face

    she held up her hands as if to keep him
  away now dont get excited her
  blue eyes were like a kittens im dor-
  othy gray my father owns the daily

	times and i work on the paper during
  vacation i played stowaway because youre
  on the trail of the news story of the cen-
  tury while you were checking out with
  the dispatcher the girl grinned i emp-
  tied your food locker and crawled in
  myself i know you must be trying to
  find out what happened to your friend
  youre the type that gets things done

    grinding his teeth norman turned back

stories

to the control panel and reached for the
turn lever now he had to take this brat
to earth - when johnnys life depended
on haste in the opposite direction no
hed put her in a space suit and kick her
out johnny was his best friend his
anger hovered an instant over the deci-
sion and in that instant he saw the girl
step aside his mouth fell open as another
figure appeared from the galley

this time it was a grown woman-
breath-takingly grown she walked in
like she owned the place smoothing a
tweed skirt above bare legs that could have
graced a glassilk hose advertisement above
a crimson blouse her hair was black as
sunless space against her cloud-like skin
she was obviously venusian with the
orchid-like beauty of all women of the
emerald planet in her hand was a stubby
jet of a pistol the round hole of its bar-
rel staring into normans bewildered eyes

  hello handsome she said ignoring
the girl beside her i was in your am-
munition locker im keren vaun just
stick at those controls im here to make
sure that the patrol gets you she sat
down on the metal box beside the galley
door she crossed her trim legs and held
the pistol steady on one rounded knee

  okay norman smiled if thats the
way you want it he turned around
clamped his long legs under the control
seat and flipped the stabilizer switch
their little world turned upside down
sprawling both females across the floor
in a mass of contrasting legs and arms

  when the switch flipped back into con-
tact the ship righted itself instantly and
norman stepped across the room and
picked up the pistol he stepped back and
squeezed his panel triggers dead guns
so youve carted out all my ammunition
and sade is really after me

  the venusian woman pulled herself up
off the floor youll find out when the
patrol sights you her black eyes looked
as deadly as her gun had

  let em come norman said

  as if his words were a cue a bell tinkled
in the room he jumped to the panel and
turned a dial lighting the blue filter to scan
the void outside the magnetic detector
warned of something outside-a patrol
cruiser
the citadel of death	

norman fingered his triggers instinc-
tively then left the dead guns in a
rage as black as the venusians hair the
only thing he could shoot at the patrol
were his hull fire extinguishers he clicked
on the rear view screen-he had to see
the patrol first now-outmaneuver them
somehow but behind him was only the
blackness of space

  the raven-haired womans sparkling eyes
grew nervous if those fools shoot-
she lit a cigarette exhaling quickly

  the bell rang frantically something
was coming at them fast he traversed
the screen again but around them was no
visible thing the sun was too bright
there was only one thing to do his hand
fell on the wheel twirled it around to
swoop off course-try to dodge the patrol
wherever they were-take a chance on
fighting his way back against sun drag

  a flash of red light burst into the room
the pilot room keeled over he fell to
the rooms glass ceiling that had suddenly
become the floor the women landed in
a perfumed heap on top of him

  he stood on the slick curve of glass
eyeing the cut-off on the control panel
which was now overhead a patrol boat
had come in from the suns blind spot
theyd chanced a long shot jammed the
exhaust tube and thrown the stabilizer off
balance seconds off course norman
could perhaps have brought her back min-
utes-the sun was an inexorable pull

  madly norman jumped to reach the cut-
off-to cut the unbalanced rocket blast that
held the ship on its back in the increasing
speed of their dive out of control they
were streaking toward the sun under full
power

  the diameter of the sun is  times
that of earth its mass is  times
as great mathematics could calculate
easily the speed of falling into that molten
inferno but norman knew only the thun-
dering of his heart in that silent room
he jumped three times for the cut-off lever
-and fell back then with fear like steel
coils in his legs he floundered up once
more leaped from the glass and the tips
of his fingers brought down the clutch

  the room slowly moved out from under
him sliding the girls across the smooth
glass he was at the controls before the

ship righted itself sweeping the panel
he jerked every rocket into reverse

  and nothing happened the power of
his blasts was nothing against the direct
pull of the sun this close the ship hurtled
toward its fiery mass at terrific speed

  among the battery of instruments on
the panel was a small stratometer cali-
brated in seconds norman saw the pointer
moving with the speed of the second hand
on a watch with each jump of the pointer
they fell thousands of miles despite the
thermo-glass heat grew in the room like a
live thing in less than three minutes he
realized the ship would begin to melt he
sprang from the controls bent over the
long coffin-shaped box beside the galley
door his fingers were frantic thumbs as
he set the dials it wasnt merely a test
of the gravitation counteractive now the
mechanism had to work or they would boil
like lobsters in the steam of the very air
they breathed

  dorothy gray stood sensibly out of the
way watching his frenzied hands switch
the delicate instrument the venusian
woman cursed softly straightening her
twisted skirt wait till i see sade again 
she said ordering his men to fire when
he knew i was in here-hey she de-
manded whys it getting so hot in here 

  dorothy pointed toward the instrument
panel see that little clock she said
oddly observant for one of her few years
thats a stratometer my dads shown em
to me on the big passenger lines it says
were falling mighty fast its getting hot
in here because were falling into the sun

  seconds thundered by as norman
twirled the rheostat knobs in the counter-
active fighting to bring the delicate focus
of its power into play against the dread
suction that was dragging them down the
thermo-glass was jet black now against the
solid heat outside with apparently a know-
ing hand dorothy set the air conditioning
unit up to maximum as drops of moisture
formed on the ceiling and dampened the
pilot room like hot dew the thermo-glass
began to bulge slightly at its invisible seams
first in thin ridges around the ceiling jut-
ting out more and more as the mad heat
increased protection against the extremes
of temperature in space it was constructed
to follow these lines of expansion but
for how long
	planet

  keren screamed razor-edged above the
electric tension in the room give me a
parasuit she cried get me out of
here

  normans fingers played the rheostats
like a piano suddenly an electric eye
blinked red as the counteractive fell into
focus on the true gravity force sector of
the sun as he leaped to the controls his
eye caught a glimpse of the stratometers
small death-white face they were sixty
seconds from cremation   

  slowly with nerve-tight slowness he
turned the brake wheel a fraction of an
inch as the hand of the clock moved on
the room was dim the panel lights casting
weird shadows along the black ridges in
the seams of the thermo-glass the ridges
jutted inward over an inch now spaced
two feet apart like braces or rafters around
the room

  suddenly keren threw herself upon
norman locked her arms around his neck
dragging his sweaty hands from the wheel
stop us she whimpered hoarsely stop
us handsome i dont want to die

ii

norman tried to fling her away from
him but the fear-crazed woman
clutched his hair as he took the wheel again
and he was almost dragged from his seat
as he turned the wheel another notch the
wheel blistered his fingers but he turned
it with will-screaming slowness ignoring
kerens clawing hands the pointer on
the stratometer climbed up the dial in
short inexorable jerks tick-tick-tick-tick
tolling their funeral march at a thousand
fiery miles per second    per second   

  in the nightmare of those moments nor-
man saw dorothys reflection in the fog-
smeared glass tugging at the frantic bru-
nette trying to pull her away from him
he saw her hand rise a wrench in it
she brought it down on the venusians
dark head as the clock swept to its nerve-
breaking jump and he spun the wheel with
all his strength

  it was a timeless instant his hand lay
limp on the wheel his eyes on dorothys
dim figure in the foggy glass she stood
there like a bad camera shot of a little
girl dressed up in her papas overalls
then slowly he realized that what he

stories

thought was the reflection of one of her
blue eyes was instead a small luminous
globe suspended in the bright nothingness
of sunlight ahead he rubbed his sweat-
burning eyes

  the blackness of the glass was fading
quickly the seam bulges sinking back with
the contraction without the slightest
tremor the counteractive had stopped their
plunge into the sun and the reverse rock-
ets had taken over they were headed
out again the blue globe grew swiftly
as they approached source of a thou-
sand tales of terror vulcan sped toward
them out of the distance

  in a few moments washed air cooled
the pilot room as the air conditioning unit
purred full speed its soft whistle the
brighter light and normans instruments
were the only evidence that they swam
effortlessly in a wild current that swept
into the gates of the solar hell

  if we had enough insulation norman
said we could go into the very flames
of the sun like we almost did anyhow
johnnys counteractive had given the uni-
verse new eyes-to seek an elixir to save
his life

  keren moaned

  dorothy held a glass of water to kerens
scarlet lips theres a mirror in the gal-
ley she told her go freshen up before
we land keren looked like a wilted
orchid and norman smiled finding it diffi-
cult to hate anyone after the ordeal they
had just survived

  kerens eyes raised to him with an un-
expected softness as she stood up im
sorry i acted like an idiot she said coolly
you saved my life and you wont regret
it she shook her sleek hair and turned
to the galley get out of my way brat
she snapped at dorothy and left the pilot
room

  norman grinned at dorothy you
wield a wicked wrench he said im glad
youre on my side

  the fifteen year old fugitive from a high
school journalism class grinned back wrin-
kling her freckled nose you wield a
wicked heart attack she said miss
vauns on your side now if not on mine

  he turned back to the controls they
were but a few minutes from the unex-
plored planet there was nothing he could
do now but take the girls along with him
the citadel of death



a junior miss and a venusian beauty queen
landing on an unknown world

  as they approached vulcan filled their
window a great smooth curve its blue
color lightening to green norman
switched off the counteractive and cut in
the landing rockets

  when kerens exotic perfume entered
the room again the land below was a map
of verdant plains rolling mountains and
glassy seas quickly it swelled to jungle
and flashing water and with a champagne
tingle in his blood norman dropped
toward an open well of meadow in the
trees

  his excitement however was tinged
with sadness johnny should be here now
they had dropped upon a score of un-
known worlds together now he landed
without his partner in a last-hope venture
to save that partners life

  the green vegetation was a colorful con-
trast against the bright yellow of dead
grass they would have to be careful
about fire norman knew hed seen that
thick grass on other sun-tropical worlds
it burned fast as gunpowder

  this close to the sun vulcan probably
had a constant wind the gravity seemed
approximately the same as earths he
plugged in the spectroscope to test the air
and as he glanced out the window at the
intake valve a slow chill trickled down his
back

  it wasnt only the wind moving the
grass outside the grass was growing

  dorothy and keren came to the window
as they watched the grass beside the hull
rose two inches

   its horrible dorothy whispered then
look she shrilled pointing

norman shook his head as if recov-
ering from a blow the words of the
mercurian ambassador ringing in his ears
vulcan is a planet without a human foot-
print    all science knew of this sup-
posedly untrod planet was suddenly a lie
there beside the ship was the unmistak-
able imprint of a human foot

  as norman looked up he saw a man
step out of the jungle and walk toward
them across the grass a jet gun bounced
on the strangers hip he wore high-top
boots a checkered hunting shirt and his
black-mustached face was heavily tanned

norman tore himself from his bewilder-
ment and turned on the outside speaker
who are you how did you get here

  same way you did the receiver
brought the fellows voice inside think
youre the only one with a counteractive

  to normans verified knowledge john-
nys counteractive was the only one listed
under inter-planetary patents he turned
on keren what do you know about
this  but she held her carmine lips tight
staring out the window

  the air must be all right he said
lets go he took his jet gun from the
compartment in the control panel and
strapped the holster close to his right hand
hot sunlight burnished the room as he
threw the panel switch opening the space
port

  he walked to the door the stranger
waited below hairy hands on his hips i
hope youve got an earthian cigarette
theyre scarce around here

  norman dropped the folding steps and
dorothy curiosity bright in her kitten-
blue eyes walked out into the windy sun-
light as norman started out the port
clanged shut in his face hurtling him back
into the middle of the room rockets
hummed as the ship leaped ten feet in the
air

  keren stood before the panel with her
hand on the rise lever norman sprang
across the room and jerked her aside as
the ship sailed out of the clearing and
plowed through the tree tops ive had
enough of your tricks lady he said
through clenched teeth

  no handsome keren cried youve
got to get us away from here before he
could right the ship she took him from
behind and pinned his arms to his sides

  you fool norman yelled twisting her
hands from him were going to crash
but the woman fought like a panther black
eyes blazing controls gone wild the ship
rolled over on its side and bumped heavily
down into the shadowed mire and ground
to a halt

  you crazy witch norman got to his
feet eying the sloping floor and the smoke
curling up from the leaves under the ship
the rockets had set the woods on fire
his port rise-rockets dangled a twisted
mass of tubes whyd you do this he
demanded facing her with itching fists


who was that fellow back there talk
he ordered before i slap your painted
face off

  her eyes were like a half-tamed cats
im not talking handsome

  norman looked into her black eyes and
ice formed in his heart so that was one
of sades men back there

  the outside speaker was still on and
in the silence came the crackle of flame
as the wind fanned the jungle fire into a
rage of orange tongues around the ship
the thermo glass instantly turned black
and its faithfully expanding seams began
pushing inward against the heat

  into the room came the hissing of a
giant snake the glass was suddenly
drenched with a misty green liquid

  antipyrol

  the fire went out as norman jumped to
the window and a silvery bulk floated down
into the jungle beside them

  it was a space cruiser a late model
twin burnished coils encircled its silvery
hull-counteractive coils norman knew
that beginning now was an ordeal that
could end only in death for himself or
whoever manned that ship it was johnnys
ship inside it could not be a friend

  through the filter glass lighted with
the fire gone he could see out but they
couldnt see in a port opened in the
cruisers glittering side steps fell to the
jungle floor and three men stepped out
norman was not surprised two of them
wore the fiery red uniform of the mercur-
ian patrol and normans eyes narrowed
when he saw their companion fat clad in
a silk shirt with his electric arm swinging
jerkily down the steps came the mercurian
ambassador gorig sade

  he and his patrolmen strode through the
muddy ashes with their guns drawn nor-
mans fingers itched for the triggers of
his starboard guns with one burst-
but the guns were empty cursing the
venusian woman he reached for his pis-
tol hed shoot it out point blank from
the door then as his hand moved toward
the panel switch to open the door he barely
felt the needle enter his back he saw
keren jump away with the hypodermic
needle in her hand

  if she had been a man norman would
have shot her on the spot instead he just
looked at her with all the hate in his soul

feeling now the stinging sensation in his
back knowing that something was already
seeping into his veins-to knock him out
paralyze him kill him-just when he had
a chance at sade just when he had a
chance to solve the mystery of johnnys
death sentence and perhaps find something
here to save him

  the crash must have shook em up
pretty bad said a voice outside well
have to cut the door open

  oddly as norman stared at the hypo-
dermic syringe in kerens hand he remem-
bered a trick hed once pulled on jupiter
a last ditch trick

hi hand jumped to a lever on the
panel and jerked it down he heard
an oath mingled with the hiss of antipyrol
as his full extinguishers spurted their jets
into the jungle for fifty yards around the
ship when he looked out he saw sade
and the two red-uniformed patrolmen stag-
gering about blindly in the green rain with
their hands covering their eyes

  theyll be blind as bats for half an
hour norman laughed cutting off the
spray he jerked a coil of rope from the
panel compartment i dont know what
you stuck me with he told keren but if
i go out you are going to be tied up till
i come to in a moment he had her
wrists securely tied behind her keren
remained silent staring at him with black-
cat eyes half closed

  throwing the door switch he stepped
to the port and found the three men stand-
ing in the ashes between the ships digging
at their swollen eyes get out he or-
dered the sullen venusian and she walked
down the steps ahead of him

  as he went out a streak of flame hissed
over the womans head and splattered on
the metal hull beside his shoulder

  he jumped backward into the cabin
behind the protecting wall peering out
carefully he saw a gun barrel glinting in
the cruisers door he smiled sade
he yelled loud enough for the blinded mer-
curian on the ground to hear im giving
you five seconds to tell whoevers in that
cruiser to come out then im shooting
you in the legs-then your good arm-then
your yellow belly

  the fat man groped about wildly help-
less and confused

           n
the citadel of death	

  one norman counted two   
three    four-

  come out swart sade shouted
hell kill me

  throw down your gun and come out
with your hands in the air norman or-
dered and to his surprise the dark-mus-
tached man of his first acquaintance ap-
peared in the door with his hands upraised
as a pistol plopped into the mud who
elses in there norman was taking no
chances

  nobody mr norman thats all of
em with excitement in her voice dor-
othy appeared behind the dark-faced swart
and norman felt a warmth of relief that
she was safe they picked us up right
after you left she said

  come here and hold this gun honey
norman said miss vaun sabotaged our
ship but weve captured a whole herd of
pigs and were going to have a barbecue
dorothy ran across the mud to him keep
this gun pointed at the fellow with the
mustache if he tries anything while im
tying his hands pull the trigger

  in a moment swart was firmly bound
and sitting on the cruisers steps sade
and the patrolmen stood rubbing their
blind eyes and cursing you slimy hog
norman said jerking sade around as he
kept an eye on the patrolmen if i didnt
want you to do a lot of talking first id
tie this rope around your neck instead of
your hands it was the first time norman
had ever tied up an artificial hand but he
only pulled the rope the tighter then
he sat the unholy group down on the steps
of the ship and surveyed them with a wide
grin

  all right he said whos talking first
before i start skinning each one of you
with a pen knife

  theres a notebook in the cruiser mr
norman dorothy said i heard the
fat one talking about it theyve found
something here and the notebook tells all
about it

  so its all written down for me nor-
man laughed watch em dorothy if
they get fidgety call me he entered the
snug well-remembered cabin kerens
hypo must have been pretty weak he still
felt nothing

  he frowned puzzled to see a narrow

-planet stories-fall

tank built around the cushioned wall push-
ing aside the space units-life preservers-
hanging on their customary hooks he
rapped the tank with his knuckles it was
heavily insulated a liquid of some sort
sloshing inside shaking his head he went
on into the pilot room where his eyes im-
mediately fell on a small black notebook
lying on the control panel he picked it
up eagerly

  complete life cycle accelerated he
read on with an eerie thrill then abruptly
universal scientific language one year
equals approximately twenty minutes   
remembering the quick growing grass he
read on with amazement then abruptly
the page became a cross-word puzzle of
chemical symbols-it would take time to
figure them out-

  i dont want to stay out there mr nor-
man a voice interrupted him it was
dorothy standing in the door theyre
saying such bad words

norman grinned point your gun
at em to hush he said she
grinned back wrinkling her freckled nose
and went outside again as he returned to
his perusal of the symbols

  they were a description of the elements
in something in a very unusual combina-
tion then slowly his eyes raised from
the notebook again something deep in the
shadows of his mind was trying to speak
-not about the symbols-about something
else something he had done something
he had seen anyhow norman had been
in enough bad spots to pay attention when
that ghostly feeling sounded its alarm

  closing the notebook he stepped across
the pilot room and walked into the cabin
into a pistols point blank explosion

  the burst of flame seared normans left
side in the same second as his hand
came up to grab the gun he realized the
impossibility of getting it in time swart
was too close his hand dropped to his
blistered side swart had him between
death and surrender

  youre lucky swarts mustache wig-
gled as hespoke get outside

  dazed at the unbelievably swift change
of events norman obeyed and as his foot
hit the first step he knew what had called
him from the notebook

  dorothy-was no longer dorothy   
	planet

she had been changed when she en-
tered the ship a moment ago but he
hadnt realized it staring at her full lips
her higher cheek bones her snub nose that
had straightened into a smooth profile-
he forgot the sudden switch of gun au-
thority until swart jabbed him in the back

  he went down the steps his eyes on what
had been the fifteen year old fugitive from
a high school journalism class just out
of pig-tails and giggles-dorothy gray
was suddenly a woman her freckles were
weirdly absent now her blond hair was
longer her arms were more full-her legs
-her- her white coveralls had shrunk
on what was now a slim lithe figure but
it was really dorothy-the same pert face
the same kitten-like eyes wide with an
astonishment as great as his own

  sades laughter broke normans blank
stare next time you tie up a man with
an artificial arm make sure it isnt electric
its easy to cause a short circuit when
youre soaked with fire extinguisher fluid
and when they short circuit they burn
through rope very easily

  but norman barely heard him barely
saw swart untying the patrolmen whose
swollen eyes were beginning to see again
he was remembering complete life cycle
accelerated one year equals approximately
twenty minutes he offered no resistance
as swart jerked the notebook from his
hand as the grass grew so had dorothy
-so had johnny to the horrible near-com-
pletion of his life cycle but why wasnt
sade keren the others affected why
not himself 

  lets get in the ship keren broke into
his thoughts theres no sense wasting
the best years of this girls life out here
with an unholy smile she walked up the
steps into the cruiser

  get in the ship norman sade said
smiling like a puddle of oil youve got
a lot more to see before we waste the best
years of your life

  inside the cruiser dorothy sank into a
pillowed chair and jerked a small pocket
mirror before her blue eyes she seemed
unable to decide whether to laugh or cry
sade keren and the patrolmen left for
the pilot room leaving swart on guard
immediately the green foliage fell away
from the windows as the ship climbed out
of the jungle

stories

  there were tears in dorothys eyes but
her newly red-bloomed lips were tight
there was horror in this tiling that had hap-
pened years of her life whisked away-she
must be eighteen now and she had the
radiant loveliness of clear sunshine

  but normans thoughts dwelt little on
the heart-quickening results of her sudden
change he pondered the change itself
again he calculated the time she had been
exposed to whatever grim atmosphere en-
veloped vulcan-she couldnt have been
out there more than a few minutes and
in those few minutes she had raced through
two long years

  but why wasnt i affected

  swart sat across the cabin with his pistol
in his lap hungrily nursing a cigarette he
had bummed from keren you were in
the ship he squinted his amusement
through a smoke ring she was on the
ground he grinned eyeing dorothy
shows up better on her too

  so that was it-something in the dank
soil but what about the others he
asked swart who only shook his head
the bossll tell you all you need to know
and norman knew there were many ques-
tions yet unanswered johnny hadnt been
one to fall into a trap laid by nature alone
there was something going on here more
than he knew yet and something told him
that he was on the right track-that in
vulcans strange power that dealt both
beauty and decay there was power here that
might spye johnny   

  finally dorothy decided to laugh i
dont know what happened she said her
voice no longer a childs but there seems
nothing to do about it-except to start run-
ning around with an older crowd when i
get back home

  if we get back home norman thought
mirthlessly if he knew sade he and
dorothy were both in the same boat a boat
that would not be long afloat im sorry
dorothy he said its my fault youre
here	

  wrong she shook her blonde head i
wanted to come with you he looked
away sensing for the first time that now
somehow they were on a diffeint basis
dorothy was no longer a child and her
girlish hero worship was apparently re-
placed by something more mature
the citadel of death	

  he felt the cruiser nose down they
were landing again

  norman reached up and yanked a space
suit from its wall hook threw it to dorothy
put this on over your coveralls as he
jerked another suit down for himself he
caught a glimpse of a jungle-walled clear-
ing with a peculiar shaped building at the
end of a small landing field

  as they slid to a quick stop the port
opened and sade and his little group ap-
peared again the fat mercurian laughed
as he saw norman and dorothy buckling
on the stiff garments he made no move
to stop them keren tells me youre very
interested in our little world he said
that tank along the wall there holds what
youre looking for but first we must show
you around

  encircled by the four patrolmen nor-
man and dorothy were hustled out of the
ship and across the landing field the odd
light-house-like building stood at the end
of the field a large windowless structure
with a conical tower on top they were
led to the building in silence ushered into
a huge room and the door closed behind
them venusian mahogany paneled the
tapestry covered walls and heavy carved
furniture was scattered about the rooms
creamy white floor sade opened a heavy
door at the side and motioned his prisoner-
guests in

  i havent time to talk now he said
heres something to entertain you until
i return he flicked a button outside the
door then closed the door leaving them
alone in the small room

norman glanced at dorothy then
turned to examine the place as he
took off his helmet the room was small
dark paneled and windowless like the one
outside a furry hak-skin rug covered
the black floor he started to speak but a
panel at the end of the room suddenly
glowed with the transparent clearness of
a window a television screen-what was
sade up to

  then norman sucked in his breath
through his teeth as dorothy clutched his
arm not the withered creature of the
hospital but the tousle-headed guy hed
grown up with-johnnys image appeared
on the screen

  johnny stood in what at first appeared

to be a clearing in the jungle but as he
kicked at some invisible obstacle norman
realized a wall of glass separated him from
the surrounding field outside the scene
was sparkling clear as if they were watch-
ing through a window johnnys futile ef-
forts to scale the smooth wall his path
around the enclosure proved it to be cir-
cular about eight fefet in diameter nor-
man ground his teeth so johnny had
been sades prisoner

  johnny took off one of his metal-soled
shoes and started hammering the fine glass
as if something whipped him into a frantic
effort to escape dorothy silent beside him
norman watched the black-haired boy rub
his eyes wearily as he pounded with the
shoe how had sade gotten this picture
what was his purpose in showing it now
the glass of johnnys prison must have
been superbly invisible but soft for slowly
he ground a shallow niche at the base of the
wall a foothold

  norman felt like yelling a cheer but he
whispered an oath s he watched johnny
grind out a higher foothold trying to
carve a niche higher still his fingers stained
the glass red quickly the glass was drip-
ping with blood look at his hands
dorothy whispered in johnnys efforts to
cling to the wall the ground glass was eat-
ing away the tips of his fingers

  and norman shuddered to see the gray
change creeping over johnnys face be-
fore his eyes johnnys dark hair became
streaked with gray and his ashen face be-
came furrowed with wrinkles horror-
ridden years swiftly heaped upon him

  dorothy covered her face with her hands
but norman couldnt tear his eyes from
the luminous screen the film had been
cut to speed it up johnny had hacked five
slits in the glass now his fingers and
thumbs were ragged stumps as he hung
on the splintered glass ten feet up the
blood-smeared wall and in his terrible
fascination norman saw that johnnys
hands healed almost as fast as they were
tom as the dry flesh of age withered his
face as he sacrificed his hands in a mad
struggle to escape the invisible terror in
vulcans sunlight

  norman slammed his fists against the
locked door sade you scum of the
universe but there was no answer as
his eyes were drawn back to the screen to
	planet

see johnnys fingerless paws grasp the rim
of his prison a wrinkled animal-like
thing eyes yellowed and wild he drew up
his gnarled legs and fell over the glass wall
into the gravel on the other side half
crawling half running he disappeared
quickly into the trees

  as though a prolonged roar of sound
had suddenly ceased the panel darkened
leaving only dorothys muffled sobs

  but in normans brain was a numb hate
that froze his reason he didnt hear the
door open behind him

  interesting wasnt it it was sades
voice but in a moment an even more
interesting experiment will take place in
my laboratory

  norman turned slowly swart and the
two patrolmen stood with the fat man at
the door norman took one quick step
forward his right hand shot out his
fingers sank like spikes into the flabby skin
of sades throat another split second
and normans fingers would have met be-
hind the mercurians windpipe and ripped
it out but in that split second the patrolmen
were on him then he was on the floor
fighting silently in the blackness of his
fury a heavy boot caught him behind the
left ear and the blackness engulfed him
completely

ill

battered and bruised he found
himself on his feet when he came to
sade stood in the door his good hand fin-
gering the blue welts on his throat his
shirt was in shreds exposing the white
blob of flesh that was his body and the
helpless sausage-end stump that was his
right arm

  if i could get my hands on you-
norman whispered

  you wont again sade said hoarsely
youre in my hands now and within
the hour i shall have two of them with
them i shall keep you alive forever while
you die a thousand deaths i hold the key
to life and death on vulcan    he
whirled again and left followed by his
henchmen and the door locked again be-
hind them

 the silky zhak-sdn rug was worn
with normans pacing when he heard the
key click in the lock again the door
opened to keren vaun ghostly beautiful

stories

against the soft light outside her starry
loveliness meant nothing to norman he
sprang to the door and covered her scarlet
lips with one hand closed the door quickly
tell me how to get to sade he demand-
ed or ill wring your neck right here i
keren remained rigid until he loosened
his grasp then shut up she whis-
pered i came to help you escape she
didnt look at dorothy i came to help
you on one condition that you take me
with you-alone

  norman hesitated three heart beats
lets go he said he heard dorothy
gasp behind him but he didnt even look
back as keren opened the door finger to
her lips and led him out

  locking the door behind her she led him
down a dim white-floored corridor nor-
man walked carefully the baggy suit rus-
tling as he moved keren halted before a
door at the side of the passage glancing
up and down the vacant hall she opened
the door quickly and went in norman
followed

  the room was bare with another closed
door on the other side you dont need
that space suit keren ordered take
it off norman peeled the suit off obedi-
ently it was no time for questions
when i jabbed you with that hypo before
sade found us it immunized you its a
vaccination sade discovered were all pro-
tected here

  as norman marveled at this strange wo-
man understanding now that fact of his
own salvation from the powers of vulcan
she motioned toward the door opposite the
one through which they had entered the
room sades-john gordons cruiser is
outside where we left it about a hundred
yards from his door its unguarded but
theres a guard in the tower hell shoot
when he sees you so you must get to the
ship quickly the cruisers guns are loaded
if you make it take off and blast this
building ill run for the woods kerens
heavy-lashed eyes met his when they
are dead vulcan will be ours

  norman smiled what if i dont come
back what if i pull out and radio earth
for help

  keren returned his smile her eyes like a
moonless night if you dont come back
ill kill the earth girl inside she threw
back her head hair swirling at her pale
the citadel of death



throat like the flow of black oil now
kiss me-and go

  it was a choice karens life or dorothys
if he got the ship and keren ran for the
woods his guns would have to find her
before they turned on the house then he
could bargain with sade by radio ill
owe you a thousand kisses he said opened
the door and darted out into the sunlight
then it was raining red heat as liquid fire
spurted around his pounding legs

  a bare twenty yards ahead the cruiser
waited glinting silver in the sun his
pants leg caught fire and he could feel its
blistering heat fanned by the wind as he
streaked across the gravel

  then he saw it too late a sheen of
crimson in the air streaks of red painted
on nothing johnnys blood flame from
the guns behind him sizzled on the invisible
glass as norman unable to check the piston
power of his legs crashed into the invisible
wall of what had been johnnys prison
his forehead hit the glass with a hollow
ring clutching the wall with both hands
he slid down to the gravel and into dark-
ness for his second failure that afternoon

  roughly they dragged him back to the
house but he wasnt out through the
searing pain in his head he had fought back
to consciousness as the patrolmen touched
him his mind limped through the pain
trying to figure out what to do now as they
dragged him into the big front room and
dropped him on the floor

  imbeciles careless fools

  the voice opened normans eyes ban-
ished the throbbing in his head as he strug-
gled to his feet but the two patrolmen
locked his arms behind him

  how did he get out the fat man
glared from norman to the patrolmen
swart stood beside him

  there were only two keys to that room
swart suggested

  sades florid face paled then his button
eyes flickered with the cold cruelty of a
wild animal find keren he said softly
bring her to my laboratory

  ricks eyes showed helpless fury as his
arms tightened in the patrolmens grasp
keren had nothing to do with it he said
i picked the lock

  sade reached out and slapped his face
repeatedly with his open palm hands
clamped behind him norman took it barely

feeling the stinging blows their impact
light under the impact of what he saw

  yes its real sade halted his slap-
ping and laughing like a fiend rolled up
his sleeves he held his hands up close
before normans eyes norman shud-
dered staring at sades right hand
slightly smaller ghastly white but firm
where the stump of sades right arm had
been was now flesh blood coursed through
the bulging veins a pale hand extended
pudgy fingers

sade howled with laughter as norman
drew back from the thing as from a
snake its real sade shouted glee-
fully flesh and blood i have two
hands now exultantly he held his
clenched fists before normans white face
in these hands i shall hold the pulse of
the universe to let it throb or halt at my
will i shall be neither king nor dictator-
i shall be a god the power of life and
death in the universe is mine

  lifting his gaze from the hands norman
met the fat mans eyes coldly howd you
do this sade 

  sades laughter dwindled to a greasy
smile after seeing what the power of
vulcan did to your friend perhaps it is
fitting that you should see this power in
reverse he nodded at the patrolmen
bring him along

  in an arm-lock on both sides norman
was dragged down the same corridor where
he had followed keren in his futile at-
tempt- to escape they halted at a door
at its far end sade opened the door
and norman was shoved in

  the place was white-walled and bare
like a hospital room but without the usual
furniture on a four-legged platform in
the center of the room lay a large porcelain
cylinder like a chamber used for sterilizing
surgical instruments but the surface of the
cylinder was smooth without gadgets only
a heavily bolted cap at one end sade
patted the cylinder as a sculptor might ad-
mire the work of his chisel this holds
what john gordon sought and what you
seek now to save his life he smirked
this container holds fluid from vulcans
fountains of youth

  standing before the cylinder normans
minds eye searched the situation for some
chance of escape here was what he had
	planet

come so far to obtain and he was powerless
to take it but perhaps it wasnt time
there was much he needed to know

  vulcans power is a radiation sade
said but not from the sun its a liquid
under the ground like earthian oil-a
radioactive element such as science has only
found traces of in the cosmic rays more
powerful than radium it exudes an exciter
to growth-a living force

  howd you discover it without being
affected by it norman asked

  your friend gordon was the guinea
pig the mercurian said norman kept
still after we took him and his cruiser
when he entered the protection zone we
came here immediately working in space
suits until my technicians on mercury dis-
covered an immunization we brought vul-
cans strange liquid in like an oil gusher
the effect of the pure liquid is instantane-
ous  its effects on the surface of the ground
outside are greatly diluted while we built
this house round the well we watched vul-
cans milder effects on your friend in the
glass cage

  normans jaw paled but he kept his
head how did johnny get off the planet
after he escaped 

  fool sade laughed he didnt escape
we could stay and watch him every minute
-thats why we left the automatic camera
to record his reactions he did contrive
to get out of the cage but when wre found
him in the jungle we simply took him off
the planet and dropped him in space in a
life boat where hed be picked up sade
laughed again did you think i didnt
know he built two ships with counterac-
tives john gordons return was merely
a message to you-to come here in that
other ship now wre have the only counter-
actives in existence vulcan is an utterly
impregnable fortress no army in the uni-
verse can interrupt my plans

  norman realized that everything sade
said was true no power could approach
vulcan without a counteractive what
are your plans sade

  the fat man held up his new right arm
his small eyes glowing my technicians
obtained for me the hand-bud of an unborn
child it was embedded in the stump of
my right arm he stared at his hand
stretched its white fingers his thick lips
smiling with but a brief exposure of

stories

my arm to a spray of vulcans liquid in
full strength i grew the hand of a thirty-
year-old man he banged the cylinder
with his fist what would happen if i
sprayed this life-death fluid in a city street
it can be placed in a shell and fired from
a gun i have here a force that can cause
the most horrible of wounds-quick decay
it can utterly destroy or immediately heal
how i use this power depends upon how
quickly the governments of the universe
submit to my wishes in a new stellar order

  but norman had a question stronger
than his hopelessness at what hed just
heard could this liquid help john gor-
don now

  instead of replying sade smiled he
stepped over to one of the rooms blank
walls and pressed a small button a wide
panel slid back revealing several tiers of
wire cages containing monkeys rabbits
and white rats sade scooped a plump slick
rat out of its cage and and closed the panel
again walking back to the cylinder he
slapped the helpless creatures head against
his wrist and stunned it then drawing
a flat shelf from the cylinders platform
he dropped the unconscious rat on it and
threw the heavy bolts on the cylinders cap

inside the thick-walled container nor-
man discovered were neatly coiled
tubes hanging on pegs sade grabbed one
of the small hoses pulled it out and
squeezed a button on the little nozzle a
fine blood-red spray hissed from the nozzle
and he directed the red mist upon the limp
body of the white rat the damp liquid
had barely touched the rats fur when in-
stantly its small face wrinkled its fur
grew coarse and thin and it assumed the
appearance of a very old animal

  still smiling sade glanced at normans
troubled gaze then shut off the hose stuck
it back in the cylinder and drew out an-
other the spray that dampened the rat
this time was light pink the rats coarse
coat thickened its sides swelled before
normans eyes and youth was born anew
in the little animals very brain as it leaped
to its feet and scurried around the shelf
with all the energy of fresh strength

  its like many poisons sade said
full strength its effect is death greatly
diluted-with mere water-its miracles
make it an elixir supreme  
the citadel of death	

  the door opened to keren followed by
dorothy and swart kerens poise little
hinted shed plotted sades death less than
an hour ago dorothy had removed her
space suit her eyes were red from crying
keren took a cigarette from her loose
blouse you sent for me sade

  the mercurians eyes were like a rattle-
snakes as he held out his two hands for
her to see i have these now he said
softly soon i shall have every world at
my command will you marry me

  the dark-haired woman lit her cigarette
calmly her hand steady yes she an-
swered simply

  sade laughed you say yes now be-
cause your life is at stake-because you
tried to aid the earthman but for that
you wont lose your life keren you will
lose something you value more than your
life keren you will lose-your beauty
get a rope swart

  keren flicked her cigarette into sades
face quick as a whip her hand entered
the throat of her blouse norman saw
the glint of naked metal flash in an arc
toward sades chest dorothy gasped

  the silver dagger sank into sades chest
just over his heart the fat man staggered
back but before he could fall swart acted
as quick as a ferret clipped kerens chin
and as she crumpled silently to the floor
he caught the gasping mercurian and eased
him down

  from sades chest blood spurted higher
than the daggers hilt as swart yanked one
of the hoses from the cylinder and directed
its crimson spray on sades wound
slowly swart drew out the daggers sticky
blade in the spray when the dagger was
out of sades chest there was no visible
sign of a wound sade opened his eyes
and looked up at them

  what shall i do with her swart said
sade got to his feet he stood there
panting a moment the rope he said
swart pushed a wall button extracted a
length of cord from a panel compartment
and returned tie her to the cylinder
sade hissed and tie the nozzle of the hose
in her hair

  in a moment the unconscious keren was
hanging by her backward-bent arms from
the cylinder the cord was tight from
her wrists around the cylinder and under
to her slim ankles in her hair was fixed

  the slowly oozing hose a rivulet of red
trickled down her smooth cheek

  what about these two swart said
motioning toward norman and dorothy

  while we go to repair the new counter-
active ship which mr norman so kindly
brought us sade said we can leave him
and his girl in the glass cage

  as they were marched across the field
norman remembered johnnys face on the
hospital pillow-tragic old now in the
green beauty of this time-thundering world
this same fate reached for them as it was
caressing kerens cheek in the white-walled
room in the tower norman put his arm
around dorothys shoulder

  she drew away you deserted me for
keren once worry about her now not
me

  swart grinned you can argue that out
while you grow old together he said
the patrolman who had come out with
them picked up a metal ladder beside the
invisible wall and leaned it against the rim
of the glass then smiling he walked
back and grabbed the collar of dorothys
coveralls we sealed up the chinks to
keep em from pulling the same trick gor-
don did but hadnt we better strip em to
make sure

  normans fists tightened but he felt the
barrel of swarts pistol dig into his side
then on a quick thought he drew a half-
empty pack of cigarettes from his pocket
leave her alone swart we havent any-
thing to escape with take these cigarettes
for our clothes

  the dark mans hand snatched them
greedily i dont know why i dont take
both but he stepped away from the
ladder and waved his pistol at them all
right get in there in ten seconds im
shooting

norman followed dorothy up the
rungs of the ladder climbed around
her and-as swart raised his gun menac-
ingly-hung on the rim of the glass and
dropped the twenty feet to the gravel in-
side their prison dorothy climbed over
and dropped into his waiting arms

as the patrolman took the ladder down
sade and the other red-uniformed gorilla
left the house and walked toward them
across the field they came up and halted
before the glass staring in at them and
planet stories



laughing dorothy stood beside norman
and he took her hand tightly

  when we leave well start to work he
whispered weve got to get you out
of here quick

  why only me 

  he told her about kerens hypodermic
work but first youve got to believe
me he said i didnt desert you when
i left with keren it was our only chance
to escape i was coming back for you
youve got to believe me he turned and
took her shoulders in his hands looking
into her blue eyes-

  slie bit her lips staring at him then
i dont want to believe anything else
norman squeezed her shoulders then
glanced up to see sade and his men walk-
ing toward the cruiser leaving the house
deserted except for keren chained to a
doom of unspeakable horror inside the
cruiser leaped from the field and floated
past them over the jungle eying the
high rim of the glass wall norman waited
until the ship disappeared over the horizon
then backed against the glass quickly and
held out his hand

  quick he told dorothy stand on
my shoulders and try jumping

  dorothy placed one small foot into his
hand and swung up to his shoulders nor-
man raised to his tiptoes-every inch
counted jump high

  her fingertips missed the rim of the
glass two full feet and clawing the slick
surface she slid back down into normans
arms try again weve got to get you
out of here

  again and again she placed her foot in
normans hand swung up leaped high-
and fell back again her forehead bruised
from bumping the glass her fingernails
broken

  youll never make it norman said
wearily weve got to think of some-
thing else  hammering his fist into his
palm he started pacing the wall suddenly
he dropped to his knees and started clawing
the gravel but he hadnt dug six inches
when he scraped against concrete several
different holes proved the ring of glass
rested on what had been a refueling plat-
form sade would have thought of that
he started pacing the wall again running
his hand around the smooth glass there
had to be a way out the glass had been

  the pilot-room shell of a ship its tapering
nose sliced off he thought of trying to
rock it back and forth to turn it over
but the glass weighed tons

  he turned and stared at dorothy help-
lessly she had scratched her finger in
one of her falls proving again that only
her body had grown she immediately stuck
her finger in her mouth upon the discovery
of the scratch normans brain seethed
he couldnt let this girl die here

  now he realized he faced the same
problem that had been johnnys and he
knew what withering shadow would claim
dorothys lips if he failed vulcan was a
hell of priceless fleeing moments each
heartbeat a drum sounding a sickening
doom of decay each tick of his watch
was the footfall of death one step closer
the invisible terror that hovered over vul-
can was beyond the grasp of imagination-
but it was real as real as kerens pale
face under that trickle of red horror as
real as dorothys fresh loveliness which
would soon be eaten away-unless he could
get her away from here

  neither he nor dorothy had any metal
with which he might attempt johnnys mad
feat standing there looking about the
enclosure normans heart beat quicker with
each second as each second took its unseen
toll upon the girl who was his responsi-
bility looking at her golden hair glinting
in the sunlight norman suddenly realized
she was more than a responsibility   
quickly he turned away

iv

the glass was thick perfectly clear
only its glimmer in the sun said they
were imprisoned beyond the field the
ever dying and growing jungle undulated
like a green sea just outside the glass
the ladder lay on the gravel where the
patrolman had dropped it-within arms
reach and it might as well have been light
years away

  look dorothy cried the scratch
on my fingers already healed she held
up her finger and there was no mark on it
vulcans power was working building a
life then to tear it down each soul-wring-
ing second created beauty clear blue-eyed
honey-haired beauty-to transform it as
swiftly into ugliness   
the citadel of death	

  it was the first time in normans event-
ful life that he had ever stared defeat in
the face he had met death before and
he had been in some pretty tight spots but
always there had been some way out not
here there was no possible way to climb
a twenty-foot wall of perpendicular oil-
slick glass

  im afraid ive failed you dorothy
he said in his mind now was only the
thought of something he must not do he
couldnt allow her to go through the horror
he had seen on johnnys gray face after
two hours when he saw the first gray
hair-he looked down at his hands
they were his only weapons against a
longer torture could he kill dorothy with
his own hands   

 well dorothy broke in on his
thoughts sade wins and when we go
the whole universe is next her voice
was a full octave lower than norman had
first heard it when she appeared at his
galley door

  norman walked over and stood before
her whatever happens he said i
want you to know this-that ive fallen in
love with you youre the bravest woman
ive ever known and the most beautiful
that combination usually doesnt go to-
gether

  she looked up at him with very blue and
serious eyes ive been in love with you
for a long time she said ever since i
first saw your picture in the paper thats
why i came with you

  her words were cut off by normans
lips then quickly he left her and walked
back to the glass staring out at the wind-
whipped jungle why wait why go
through this torture any longer get it
over with now

  gods of the universe forgive me he
whispered and turned to take her throat
in his hands

  light flashed across his face it was
dorothys mirror she held it smoothing
her sun-burnished hair a thought burst
into his consciousness like a butterfly from
a cocoon

  he jumped over and snatched the mirror
from her hand ripped his watch from his
wrist and flipped off the crystal with his
thumbnail letting the watch drop to the
ground

  whatre you doing 

  he didnt bother to answer his pulse
was liquid fire as he held the watch crystal
close to the glass wall with one hand and
focused the rays of the sun into it with
the mirror a thin curl of smoke rose
from the jungle across the field then
where the smoke had been an orange flame
licked up from the dry grass he dropped
the mirror and the watch crystal and
grabbed dorothy close to him in the cen-
ter of their prison holding her tightly

 why why

  youll see

lashed by the wind the fire spread
like a flood a blast of smoke engulfed
the glass obscuring their view with its
swirling whiteness then bits of flaming
ashes dotted the smoke as the flames found
new fuel in the rotted trees standing
there holding dorothy in his arms nor-
man saw the glass around them slowly
darken quickly as the wind brought the
increasing heat upon them the glass turned
black and all he could see was the wild
smoke rolling across the hole at the top
of their stifling cage he felt dorothy
coughing heat swam in the blackness
about them

  then almost as suddenly as it had begun
the wind swept the smoke away and nor-
man tore himself away from dorothy and
sprang to the glass wall without waiting
till the glass lightened he ran his hand
across its blistering surface when the
thermal quality of the glass permitted the
passage of light and the sight of the smol-
dering forest across the field norman was
half way up the slick side climbing like
a ladder the bulging ridges that encircled
the glass at its invisible seams

  as dorothy stared at him unbelieving
he vaulted over the rim and jolted with
stinging feet to the hot gravel outside the
metal ladder was like a live coal in his
hands but he barely felt it as he threw it
against the wall and ran up it like a
squirrel sitting on the cooling rim he
drew the ladder up after him and dropped
it inside for dorothy

  soon they were streaking across the
steaming gravel toward the house doro-
thys hair streaming in the smoky wind

  norman burst into the big front room
with dorothy behind him their running
feet were loud in the silent house as they
	planet

sped down the corridor norman dreading
what he would find tied to the cylinder
where they had left keren you dont
want to see this he said halting at the
closed door try these other doors and
find a gun sade may be back any
moment 

  dorothy obediently turned away as he
went in and the sight that met his eyes was
to figure in many a future nightmare half
way between the door and the cylinder
keren lay on the floor more like some hide-
ous reptile than a human being staring up
at him her eyes two black holes hate alive
in them the only life in what was left of
her face

  norman stepped over and picked her up
his fingers recoiling from the touch of
leathern skin and bone her luxurious
hair had vanished leaving a skull cracked
skin tight across her cheek bones the
rope that had held her to the cylinder had
slipped from her shrunken wrists and how
she had crawled this far norman couldnt
tell

  he carried her to the cylinder opened
the heavy cap and drew out the small hose
that sade had used to restore to youth the
white rat quickly he sprayed the pink
liquid upon her face and body-a treatment
that was to rewrite all of medical science
her cheeks swelled again to the form of a
living face and like a trick of superimposed
motion picture work before his eyes
kerens skeletal structure became covered
again with firm rounded flesh and on her
head wispy black threads appeared and ex-
tended again into a silken sable mass

  to save the spark of life that remained
with johnny norman knew he had to get
this material back to earth now which
meant a finish fight for a space ship are
you strong enough now weve got to
ambush sade

  it was an effort for keren to reorganize
her forgotten coordinations which enabled
her to speak her lips moved soundlessly
as he carried her to the door and down
the passage he explained quickly how
he and dorothy had escaped

  there are guns in the tower she
managed to whisper as they entered the
front room

  dorothy stood at the door with two jet
rifles peering out at the still deserted field
i found these in their bedroom she said

stories

handing norman one of the guns is she

all right i thought-

  norman told her what he had done to
revive keren but heres what we do he
said lowering keren to a sofa sade
will see the empty cage and know theres
something wrong when he comes in to
land he will probably attack the house
weve got to get back in the cage keren
can vaccinate you he nodded to dorothy
allaying her hesitation when they land
ill jump out and take care of as many as
i can keren can get the rest from the
tower

  theres a glass cutter in the store
room keren said nodding her approval
of the plan her cheeks were white as
paper but she got up and walked unsteadily
from the room

  the liquid brought her back from the
grave norman whispered to dorothy
watching keren walk up the hall

keren returned immediately and
gave norman the glass-cutter which
was an instrument shaped like a small rivet-
ing hammer one promise she asked
sades mine ill be in the tower youve
got to save him for me

  keren took her hypodermic from her
pocket and at normans smile dorothy
permitted the needle to enter her arm all
right lets go

  with the cutter in one hand and the
rifle in the other norman left the house
again with dorothy running beside him

  at the glass cage again it was short
work to cut a narrow door at the base of
the smooth wall with an eye on the hori-
zon norman quickly covered the cutter
with gravel then motioned dorothy into
the invisible enclosure that had been their
prison and so nearly their mausoleum
well play dead he explained stretching
out on the gravel with the two rifles hidden
under him dorothy lay down beside him
when they leave the ship and come over
here ill jump out you stay inside in
case they get a chance to shoot back
suddenly the air hummed with the flow
of rockets here they are but the
sound told norman that his job was doubled
in danger there were two ships now
the other his own theyd repaired it

  rockets idling they hovered over the
field and slowly settled sades group was
the cttadel of death	

now split in two parties-he couldnt sur-
prise them both   

  dont move norman whispered feel-
ing dorothys soft hair against his cheek
his fingers tightened on the guns under
his body his pulse was loud in his ears
if they suspected something but it was
too late for worry now he heard foot-
steps on the gravel as the sound of the
rockets sputtered and died away

the next second was a lifetime
then suddenly he was on his feet he
whirled ducked out through the hole in
the glass the guns in his hands were
spitting their red streams before his eyes
found the men before him and he played
the guns like two garden hoses spraying
death the two patrolmen fell charred
and black but the two groups had ruined
his ambush swart sprang aside behind
the glass wall as the flame streaked past
him norman saw sade standing the door
of the ship staring at the wild scene the
door was slammed shut as normans guns
splattered the hull with fire then the
fight was between him and swart alone

  on the opposite sides of the ring of
glass dorothy standing there horrified
between them it was one of the strangest
situations in normans experience the
glass was impervious to jet fire dorothy
was perfectly safe but as norman moved
around the wall to get a shot at swart the
dark little man also moved keeping the
arc of glass between them it couldnt
continue a sudden sheet of flame rushed
past one side of the glass sade firing
from the ship swart was not slow to
take advantage of the opportunity quickly
he slid around the wall to corner norman
against sades fire

  norman stood waiting rifles poised to
blast swarts gun barrel as it nosed past
the curve of glass but swart was no fool
he was playing for time norman heard
the throbbing as sade started his rockets
sade was moving the ship to trap him
between their guns

  norman started to jump back through
the hole in the glass but that would be
suicide while swart guarded the door
sade could pick them off from above in
the ship then an idea whispered in nor-
mans mind if he could lure swart from
die protection of the glass into kerens

sights in the the tower-if he could trust
keren-but there was nothing else to do
he ducked into the enclosure beside
dorothy

  swart laughed norman could hear it
inside the glass quickly swart stepped to
the edge of the hole his pistol covering
their exit smiling at them through the
wall you aint very bright norman
it was the last breath that ever passed his
lips for a long thin line of flame suddenly
stretched from the tower to the small of
his back swart dropped without a sound
surprise on his dead face

  but sades ship was already in the air

  hell come and strafe us norman
shouted to dorothy above the roar of the
rockets he took her hand dragged her
out of the cage past swarts body they
had to get to the cruiser their only hope
was a fight with sade in the air but the
sound of sades rockets stopped norman
in his tracks as he started to dash for the
cruiser sades ship was skimming the
field twenty feet off the ground his rockets
sputtering like a gasoline engine with a
broken piston

  the ship was headed directly toward
the house apparently unable to rise then
norman saw what had happened kerens
rifle had hit the rise rocket tube the
heavily repaired solder work had burned
through unable to gain altitude the ship
hurtled into the house like a freight plane
gone wild the plastic walls ripped like
tinfoil as the ships heavy nose plowed
into the building just below the tower

  there was no explosion the impact
killed the rockets dust plumed up like
a geyser disappeared swiftly in the wind
leaving the ship hanging there tail out
stuck in the building like an arrow

  norman and dorothy were at the door
before the debris stopped falling the
front room was choked with dust andbits
of torn plastic rained from the ceiling as
they ran down the shadowy corridor the
door leading to the tower stairs hung on
its hinges admitting a beam of sunlight
from the demolished upper story they
ran up the broken stairs swaying precari-
ously the cracked hull of the ship lay
in the debris of what remained of the
tower the wall had been sheared off
level with the floor on one side and sway-
ing out from the foundation below a misty
	planet

rainbow sparkled its colors in the sunlight
hissing softly as the red fluid escaped from
a pipe hidden in the wreckage sades
well around which the house was built had
split in the crash

  leaving dorothy at the top of the stairs
norman climbed over the chunks of plas-
tic into the tower room then he realized
his foolhardiness too late a chill tin-
gled the back of his neck as he saw the
ships port hanging open

  he heard dorothys warning cry behind
him as he turned around slowly

  sades grimy bulk stood beside a chunk
of plastic at the edge of the littered floor
the sunlight glistened on the pistol in his
hand as it squirted a stream of red flame
upon the barrel of normans rifle the
gun dropped from normans blistered fin-
gers

  you thought you could escape what
vulcan and i can do sade said none
can escape us for vulcan and i control
the universe from now on he pointed
his pistol to the floor at normans feet and
pulled the trigger norman stepped back
as the flame licked up around his shoes
keep walking until you fall into that
rainbow down there

  wait sade norman stepped back
again as the line of fire followed him
theres no time for this that pipes
going to burst wide open any moment
he shifted from one foot to another the
soles of his shoes burning

  jump sade said quietly he raised
the gun higher

norman retreated another step two
feet lay between him and the edge
of the sheared wall the end of the floor
and then the misty lethal colors hissing
ten feet below

  dorothy scrambled over the plastic
wreckage and threw herself at sade but
the flat of his palm met her face and
hurled her aside the line of fire moved
to normans toes again and he stepped
back his last step like a cobra wavering
before its prey the flame swept back and
forth across the floor inches from nor-
mans toes scorching the floor under his
feet he glanced down at the crimson mist
leaping like a fountain under the splinters
of plastic jutting out over it then he

stories

realized that fate had given him his chance

-for a price

  he had come to vulcan to find some-
thing to save johnnys life in the tank
in the cruiser out on the field was the fluid
that could do that on the broken wall
below him just over the fountain of death
a piece of the wreckage jutted outward
two feet-he could leap to that swing
clear of the mist and reach the ship and
be free he could save johnny-by leav-
ing dorothy behind

  there could be no compromise he had
no doubt that sade would kill her the
instant he realized the trick

  norman glanced back into sades
triumphant smile suddenly he returned
the smile and laughed out loud whend
you take your last vaccination sade he
laughed did you know your hair had
turned white

  sade held his smile as steady as his gun
im not leaving you and look for a mir-
ror he said no tricks will save you
this time those shots are good for 
hours

  not with all this raw stuff in the air
norman laughed look how your hands
have withered

  what matter sade said my foun-
tain of youth can restore me again but
his smile loosened and quick as light his
glance dropped to his hands normans
knees straightened like steel springs the
length of flame seared his hip as he sprang
then his fist piled into sades heavy jaw

  the gun flew out and down into the
mist sade hit the floor rolling and strug-
gled to his feet as norman was on him
like a hurricane he crossed jabs into his
face with both fists then stepped back and
swung a long arc that crushed the big
mans nose sade stumbled backward
screamed arms flailing the air wildly and
fell backward off the edge of the floor

  norman stepped over and looked down
deep in the eery rainbow mist that swirled
around him sade scrambled to his feet
and looked around frantically confused
with the colors his hair turned snow
white his round cheeks tightened across
the bones of his face and his big belly
vanished in his baggy clothes he held
his face and hands up before his face and
forgot norman to stare at his skeleton-
like fingers then his hands still raised
the citadel of death



before his eyes he sank to the ground as
his legs collapsed the shoes fell off his
bony feet as he lay there writhing

  norman shook his head rubbed his eyes
sade wasnt writhing it was the wind
rustling his clothes

  norman found dorothys sunlit head
pressed against his shoulder as she cried
like a baby he touched her hair gently
then turned to the wreckage of the tower

  a moments search in the debris dis-
closed kerens broken form he lifted
her dead weight in his arms and with dor-
othy behind him went quickly down the
stairs in the front room he laid keren
on the sofa and risking one moment more
jerked a tapestry from the wall and gently
covered her body then they ran out of
the house and across the field to the cruiser

  as he helped dorothy through the port
he heard a cyclone roar from the house
he shoved dorothy in jumped in after
her and slammed the door through the
glass they watched the house fly to pieces
like a bursting bomb as a giant flower of
red spouted high over the field then
where the house had been stood a waver-
ing red column feet thick towering above
the green jungle it sprayed down upon
the cruiser like a scarlet rain

  they stared at the vivid scene until the
red film covered the cabin windows then
norman thumped the tank around the cabin
wall heard its dull fullness and walked
into the pilot room and sat down at the
controls theres plenty in the tank for
johnny he said and theres plenty on
vulcan for the universe

  what shall we name it  dorothy said

  as they soared away from the planet
and their increasing speed washed the red

film from the glass norman looked at
the dwindling green globe that was vulcan

and lived again swiftly all that had hap-
pened there and strangely now that it
was over one phrase whispered in his mind
ill owe you a thousand kisses   

  lets name it kerine  he said we
owe her more than we can ever repay

the word kerine was being
shouted in every street and across
every backyard fence in the universe two
days later and it was a tense moment out-
side a closed white door in a hospital in
new york city although the surgery
was on the fifteenth floor norman and
dorothy could hear the clamor in the street
below as thousands halted traffic for blocks
around and the policemen stood by with
folded arms smiling downstairs the
lobby was packed with photographers and
reporters waiting

  as the white door opened norman and
dorothy jumped to their feet norman
could hear his heart thumping above the
noise from the street as he looked down
at the sheet-covered stretcher the nurses
rolled out the door as the stretcher rolled
into the hall the face appeared and deep
within his pounding heart norman yelled
his joy johnnys face was pale and thin
as if recently recovered from a long ill-
ness but it was johnnys face his barber-
shy black hair tousled on his forehead

  hello chum johnny said the doc
told me all about it then he glanced at
dorothy so thats her

  shes got exclusive rights to the story
norman grinned

  i cant wait to get back in a full dress
suit johnny said for the wedding

	for yourself for your family

and closed the intake valve of his helmet
count five seconds and he unhooked the
exhausted tank of oxygen count ten more
and it was spinning away end over end

over plutos frozen surface and a new
tank was already in place he slipped the
pressure valve and inhaled deeply of the
new air

  hed come ten miles by the phosphores-
cent figures on the nightstone markers be-
side the trail fifteen more miles to go

  his cold black eyes stared absently at
the east where the pseudo-life of the great
plutonian crystals rolled in a shifting
tinkling sea he noted the water-avid
crystals and noted the three crablike

	planet

crawlers that munched a solitary clump of
metallic grass you dont walk talk and
breathe after a tri-planet lawman has de-
clared you dead unless you note everything
around you and react to what may be dan-
gerous

  but he was looking beyond the familiar
plutonian drear to the eastern horizon
where faint lights gleamed in the dark
that was port avalon that was where
steve nolan was bound

  woller was in avalon the alan wol-
ler who had made him an outlaw roaming
the star trails from pluto to the satellites
never daring to return to the inner worlds
where tri-planet kept order

  there was a slow pulse mounting in
nolans throat as he walked on savagely
kicking a crab-shelled crawler from his
path hed seen the newssheet months
old in a rickety old port on one of the
satellites-io ganymede-when he was
down to forty credits and a friendly bar-
tender it hadnt been much of an item
the kind a country editor throws into his
finance column when he unexpectedly loses
an ad and has to fill space

    the new shipping company which
  expects to do much for improving com-
  mercial relations with the outer planets
  is headed by alan woller formerly
  with the interplanetary telenews com-
  pany woller is remembered as the
  prosecutions star witness in the trial of
  steve nolan the junta agent indicted
  for treason three years ago nolan sen-
  tenced to life imprisonment in luna
  cave was killed while attempting to
  escape

    the new company is capitalized at
  over a billion dollars and has already
  taken options on bases in   

  the drink had drained out of steve
nolan when he saw that and the bar-
tender had been too friendly for his own
good hed been a soft touch for five hun-
dred credits

  that had been rocket fare to pluto for
nolan

he felt the drumming with the soles
of his feet a hard grinding sensa-
tion against his metal boots he jumped
off the trail quickly and whirled to watch
for the approaching skid

stories

  it was moving slowly chugging along
wi a single jet

  clogged feeders nolan thought as he
felt the uneven vibrations if he doesnt
watch out hell have a backblast

  the skid faltered past him no faster
than he could run he looked away from
the incandescent flare of the one tail jet
then that stopped too tall as a man a
dozen feet long the skid lay waiting on
the trail

  waiting for steve nolan

  anything was better than walking no-
lan walked up to the skid not fast and
kicked solidly at the entrance it slid open
with a creaking noise and he was in the
tank sealing the outer door behind him

  the inner door didnt open a female
voice from a speaker said who are you 

  steve waited till he saw the pressure and
temperature gauges shoot up to normal
then swung open his faceplate matthews
is the name he lied easily out of three
long years of practice i thought you
were waiting for me say the word and
ill get out again if i was wrong

  oh no the girls voice hesitated a
second what are you doing out here

  ttm on my way to avalon out of
aylette a skid bus took me across the
ice plains then i caught a lift on a pros-
pectors skid he turned off ten miles
back and i decided to walk the rest of the
way

  do you know anything about skids
mine isnt working very well ill pay you
if you can-

  im not a mechanic nolan said
wearily

  oh then you cant fix it

  i didnt say that you cant pay me for
it ill take a lift to avalon though

  a lift but i dont know you from
adam

  nolan sighed lady i dont know you
either believe me all i want is a ride
itll take me four hours to walk to avalon

i cant spare the time if i can help it
he waited a second no answer he
shrugged and finished his speech ill
make you a proposition let me in and
ill fix your jets well be in avalon in
twenty minutes ill get out and well never
see each other again dont let me in and
ill tear these ignition wires right out of the
lock then well both hitchhike
highwayman

  the girls voice came with controlled
anger you win she said come in
there was a soft click and the inner door
yielded under nolans hand he stepped
in

  no hard feelings he said mildly i
really wanted the ride one thing you
might remember in the future though-
there are no ignition wires in an air lock

she was pretty she was small she
was blue-eyed and brunette but she
didnt say a word to him she kept to her
seat at the controls watching him lift the
top off the distributing chamber prod
around in the gummy mess inside for a
second then replace it and nod

  you can start it up now lady he said
he glanced over her shoulder through the
plastic panel to where avalons lights
were glowing where woller was and
the quicker he said the better

  the girl looked at him curiously but
said nothing she turned and fingered the
controls the song of power that came
out of the skids jets brought a quick
slight smile to her lips nolan caught a
glimpse of her eyes reflected back at him
from the plastic panel appreciative eyes

  he averted his look would there be
another time when he could meet the gaze
of a decent girl and answer it

  when woilers dead his subconscious
answered him until then youre not a
man nolan youre a weapon

  the skid was climbing hugging the side
of one of the vast foothills to annihilation
range itself a hundred-foot chasm on one
side and the cliff on the other nolan
watched the girls hands for a sharp sec-
ond then relaxed she knew what she
was doing unerringly the skid split the
center of the trail following its many
turns as though on a track but-

  a sudden high sound escaped her lips
her foot trod hard on the back-jet pedal
the skid slewed crazily its side crunching
against the cliff as it halted

  what the- snarled nolan hand leap-
ing to the concealed pyro he wore under
his shirt then he saw

  ahead of them was an immense rounded
bulk dome-shaped black as the frozen
night a crawler    but what a crawler i
its horny shell was half again the height

-planet stories-fall

of the void	

of a man filling the trail from cliff to
chasm brink there was no passing that
beast no wonder there had been no traf-
fic from avalon

  mutely the girl turned to nolan pie
grinned sourly then clambered into the
heat suit hed just put off

  he eyed the girl for a second im go-
ing to have to trust you i have to get to
avalon so i have to get this misbegotten
monstrosity out of my way and i have
to leave the skid to do it that gives you
a fair clear chance

  the girl shook her head ill take you
to avalon i owe you that much but-
but how-

  watch nolan said curtly and climbed
into the tank before he closed the door
a thought struck him

  he poked his head out at her if any-
thing should go wrong he said and i
find myself scattered all over that valley
down there youd better stay put keep
the crawler away with the brake jet and
wait for someone to come along youre
not the skidster to back this crate all the
way down the trail with just a brake jet
then he slammed the inner door sealed
his helmet pushed his way out

  the crawler was even bigger than hed
thought standing within ten feet of it he
felt tiny and weak a toy before this mas-
sive brute like ancient earth dinosaurs
the crawlers kept growing as long as they
lived tiny as the palm of a mans hand
foot-high creatures like those nolan had
kicked out of his way an hour before or
monstrosities like the one before him-all
three types existed side by side only sel-
dom did they grow as great as this in-
vulnerable though they were they perished
of starvation when their bulk grew too
much for their thousands of tiny legs to
carry

  out of the ebon hulk of the thing came
poking a minute head goggle-eyed with a
luminous halo of green tendrils surround-
ing it it blinked weakly at nolan he
waited patiently if the thing was con-
vinced he was harmless

  it was recovering from the shock of
the skids arrival it began to prepare for
motion again the head poked out to-
ward the skid on a long scrawny neck
examined it minutely the big carapace
shivered and rose slightly off the ground
	planet

as the multitude of tiny legs took up the
task of carrying it forward

  nolan stood motionless the creature
moved ponderously toward him ignoring
him in the dull mind of the creature an
object as tiny as a man was nothing even
the skid was merely another sort of boul-
der against which it could lean send it
hurtling over to destruction out of its
way

  it moved forward till the hard horn al-
most touched him then nolan leaped

  this was the moment of decision he
circled the long neck with one lashing arm
clamped on it all the pressure he could
bring to bear it was the one sensitive
spot the creature had-and protected nor-
mally by armor battleship-thick

  nolan strained the muscles of his arm
cursing the cushion of air inside his suit
that made a pillow for the beast the
slippery flesh coiled and writhed in his
grip the beast exhaled a great whistling
screech of agony and the snakelike neck
curved around the popeyed head darted
in at him tiny mouth distended to show
raw red flesh inside it battered inef-
fectually against the heavy plastic face-
plate of his suit

  the crawler vented its whistling sigh
again and staggered drunkenly away
away from the remorseless pressure on its
sore spot away from the agonizing weight
of him its tiny legs carried it rocking
sidewise

  then abruptly they tried to halt it gave
sharp warning to the tiny brain it was
too late

  the scrambling legs flailed for a foot-
hold and found vacuum nolan gave a
final heave felt the thing slide away from
him leaped back just in time he him-
self was teetering on the brink of the
chasm as the crawler tiny head darting
frantically soundlessly around slid over
and disappeared

  he didnt look down the clattering
and crashing vibrations from below told
what happened he turned shook himself
and headed for the skid

  the girl was waiting for him nolan
was mildly surprised she looked at him
curiously as he entered

  a dirty job she offered tentatively

  he shrugged yes he said lets
get moving

stories

  she turned without a word all the
way back to avalon her back was a silent
reproach friendship it said had been
offered-and rebuffed

  nolan had his private thoughts and
dwelt in them except for the muffled blast
of the rockets there was no sound in the
skid until theyd jetted into the great cargo
lock in avalons crystal dome and the
handlers had come to slide the skid into
a parking space

  then as they got out she smiled sud-
denly

  she said i guess i misjudged you mr
matthews im sorry i was discourteous
but a girl cant be too careful let me
take you to dinner for an apology

  nolan paused and stared at her soberly
then no thanks he said i meant it
when i said i wasnt interested in you i
have things on my mind already he
ignored her outstretched hand turned to
leave then stopped oh yes he said
thanks for the ride

  he walked cumbrously over to a storage
cubicle without looking back he stripped
off his heat suit and checked it with a
stout man in pluto-city green

  it was time to plan his next move there
was a pilots hangout he remembered a
saloon called the golden ray he took a
worn notebook from his shirt pocket
thumbed it to the forgotten address and
held the page up for the checking attendant
to see

  how do i get there

  the mans eyes widened a fraction as
he took the address in he shrugged imper-
ceptibly any slidewalk going north
he said get off at the hub and youll be
within a couple blocks of it

nolan nodded and headed for a mov-
ing sidewalk the notebook went
back into the pocket of his open-necked
black shirt and the hand that put it there
paused a second to touch reassuringly the
weight of a slim-barreled pyro that swung
beneath his armpit out of sight it was
nice to know it was there even though he
didnt need it-yet

  he paused in a robot restaurant to eat
saloons like the golden ray dont sell
much food-particularly to those who
have tasted it once it was getting on to-
ward night
highwayman

  the slidewalks were fast and the first
man he stopped at the hub told him all he
needed to know to find the saloon once
he got within a block of it it all began to
come back it had been years since hed
been there but the place hadnt changed

  a blast of sound struck him as he clawed
his way through thick tobacco smoke and
sweet martian hop-incense fumes to the
bar he nodded his head and the short
motion yanked a fat bartender to him

  the mans slitted eyes peeped surpris-
edly through the surrounding tallow

  gunner he whispered amiable but
hoarse thought you were somewhere
around jupe whatll it be

  itll be nothing right now nolan said
i thought petersen might be here i
want to see him

  oh sure the bartender said hes
dealin red-dog at one o the tables in the
back

  nolan was called gunner by those
who knew him by his alias- hed never
taken the trouble to think up a first name
for matthews he nodded and stepped
away

  it wasnt hard to find petersen when
you knew his habits the wrinkled little
man always sat in the noisiest spot he could
find this time it was a table right behind
the four-piece orchestra pride of the pro-
prietors heart

  nolan stood silently for a moment be-
hind the little mans chair to watch the
play he marveled at the ease with which
petersens gnarled fingers handled the fly-
ing pasteboards as usual petersens pile
of chips was low and the set of his back
was discouraged

  nolan grinned it was part of peter-
sens stock-in-trade to look like the tail end
of a losing streak the sucker trade stays
away from a winning gambler but they
flocked to petersen-and his pockets were
always clinking

  petersens gamblers sixth sense was
functioning he twitched his shoulders
uncomfortably then turned around glar-
ing up say he began who the hell
are- oh gunner i

  nolan nodded hey there peter he
said

  petersen grinned and blinked he looked
wi regret at his top card then at nolan
no he asked wistfully

of the void	

  nolan shook his head no

  the little man shrugged and flipped his
cards away okay he said cheerfully
shoveling his chips into his clanking pock-
ets lead on gunner

  nolan led on to a more secluded comer
where the clamor of the alleged orchestra
was less deafening he sent a waiter off
for a bottle of sealed terrestrial scotch
then turned to petersen

  wheres woller he asked

  petersen scowled listen steve he
begged stay out of trouble wollers big
here

  dont call me steve nolan said
mildly two living men knew that nolan
and matthews were the same petersen
was one of them-nolan himself the other
i manage my own affairs i want to see
woller

okay petersen groaned hes at the
elena the big hotel near south lock
nolan nodded good enough he
said ill take care of my business widi
him right away

  the greasy-aproned waiter came back
with the scotch nolan inspected the seal
critically then broke it and poured two
generous slugs how he said whatve
you been doing with yourself pete
petersen swallowed his scotch grim-
aced non-committally following the pros-
pectors he said making money and
losing it its been a long time since you
were here

  nolan ignored the implied question
pretty long he agreed i wasnt figur-
ing on coming but i heard woller was
here

  petersen nodded his head sadly youre
aching for trouble he observed wol-
lers no man to buck up against hes got
money behind him

  whose money

  i dunno some martian syndicate
they say hes come a long way since he
was your boss at telenews

  not so long i couldnt follow him
petersen cocked an eyebrow then
poured another round you followed
him into a bad spot he said slowly this
whole town is be-jittered hes doing
about what he likes and nobody says boo
why

  petersen frowned  cause theyre
scared it looks scared of the junta
	planet

talk is there are junta men around i
wouldnt have to remind you i guess of
what woller can say about you if he sees
you

  nolan nodded he wont see me-in
time for it to do him any good

  petersen shivered youre building up
trouble he repeated wollers pretty
near running this place

   a louse  nolan quoted  enthroned
in luxury will still a loathsome insect
be thats woller

  petersens wizened little troll-face gaped
at him lice bite he said succinctly

  nolan said soberly live ones do
after tonight woller may not be able to
bite anybody dead lice have no friends

ii

steve nolan was deceptively slen-
der in his open-necked black military
shirt and trim khaki slacks in the half-
hearted illumination thrown by avalons
old gasglow lights he looked almost
boyish

  but he didnt look like the pale youth
hed been three years before the good-
natured roundness of his face had con-
tracted to show the hard bone underneath
there was the ghost of a scar close to
an eye and the seared mark of pyro burn
where neck joined his right shoulder the
long fingers that once had twirled the
toggles of a field newscasters walky-talky
now were better acquainted with the
groves of a pyro butt

  for the last time he said youre
better off home in bed i think there
may be trouble

  petersen looked sour good thinking
he said i have a hunch that way too
im going to stick around

  nolan shrugged he eyed the hotel
elena towering almost up to the crystal
dome directly across the street from him
its your neck he said you can catch
me when i fly out he glanced quickly
at a wrist-chrono a quarter after
four he said if im not out in half
an hour dont wait up i may be de-
tained

  before petersen could answer he was
crossing the street entering the hotel
the elena was large and the night clerk
couldnt be expected to know every guest

stories

he glanced up as nolan entered then
went back to nodding over his magazine
nolan walked to the grav-well and stepped
in

  nolan let the curiously soothing grav-
currents flow over him carrying him up
till hed ascended twelve floors that was
where woller was by the best informa-
tion petersen had been able to give him
he reached out a hand and swung himself
out of the flow into a silent corridor

  not quite silent nolan listened and
smiled there was a party somewhere
overhead a vise-box blared briefly in one
of the rooms on this corridor as a sleep-
less guest hunted music from the grav-
well came the low humming of the gen-
erators

  that was fine if it were necessary to
make any noise it might be confused with
the vise-box or the singing from overhead

  wollers door was locked of course
nolan bent over the keyhole for a second
there was a tinny springy click and the
door drifted open under the slow pressure
of his hand

  the room was large and empty a
library perhaps as well as he could
judge by the intermittent blood-tinted
light that filtered in from an advertising
stereolume across the street nolan flipped
his cigarette lighter out held it aloft and
pressed the button in the dim glow it
shed he saw twin doors after a mo-
ments hesitation he chose one opened it
gently slipped through into a bedroom

  a night light glowed softly on the wall
revealing nothing nolan sniffed the air
curiously then wrinkled his nose per-
fume woller had added a new vice to
his character nolan grimaced contemptu-
ously then moved toward the indistinct
figure on the bed his right hand dipped
inside his shirt came away with the slim
pyro protruding from his fist

  woller he said wake up youve
got company

there was a rustle from the bed
a gasp a metallic click nolan
jumped back cursing he flung an arm
over his head as the overhead lumes burst
into blinding light but hed caught a
quick stunning glimpse of what was on
the bed and quicker than starflight his
pyro jutted toward the lumes flared
highwayman

wickedly all lights died as the blast
shorted the wires

  it had been a girl in the bed blinking
up sleepily mouth a taut line of surprise
the girl-the one from the skid the one
hed encountered in annihilation range
she had no more of a look at him than
he at her and she had been sleep-dazed
staring up at the light perhaps she hadnt
recognized him-

  hold still he hissed-there is no per-
sonality to a whisper wheres alan
woller

  who are you the girls voice came
a trifle unsteady good-she hadnt recog-
nized him

  nolan laughed voicelessly im the
man with the gun he replied i ask
the questions wheres woller

  none of your business the girl said
there was a note of confidence in her
voice and suddenly nolan felt a furtive
movement from the bed was there an
alarm-a bell to summon servants

  hold it he whispered sharply one
wrong move and ill kill you i mean
business-and i want an answer

  the girls voice was even now i
wont give one

  nolans brows drew down over his eyes
what was this girl to woller whatever
the connection was by rights he should
take no chances the girl was a danger to
him-and the life of no woman on wol-
lers string should be permitted to stand
between him and the chance for vengeance
on the man who had framed him

  ill give you ten seconds he whis-
pered harshly

  but already he was stepping silently
backward concealed in the abyss-black
gloom of the chamber he reached noise-
lessly behind him for the knob of the door
he was being a fool and he knew it
but he had seen honesty in her eyes back
on the skid and even the yearning for
revenge couldnt make him blot that out
with pyro-fiame

  he opened the door slid out closed it
softly behind him the girl said nothing
perhaps had not known he had gone
nolan cast a quick longing glance at the
other door but there was no time in
seconds the girl would discover she was
alone there would be an alarm surely
a dim thread of light showed him the

of the void	

door to the hall catlike he crossed to
it then halted petrified men were com-
ing down the hall several of them by the
voices he caught a snatch of a rasping
complaint old man ivoilers tin soldiers
thats us who the hell does he-

  nolan swore lividly under his breath
the end of the trail had come

  but he stepped back a pace and stood
there pyro up-tilted and ready he
would have a split-seconds advantage if
only there were no more than two or
three of them-

and then the sound was drowned
out a sharp moaning screech came
from outside a harsh metallic wail that
climbed for the frigid heavens above
louder than the screaming trumpets of
ragnarok

  the alarm sirens there was a break in
the crystal dome that held the life of
avalon

  meteorite accident or simple fatigue-
the dome had cracked air and heat
would vanish death would tenant the
city

  there was a sudden sharp babble from
the men outside then the pounding of
footsteps halting as they dove into the
grav-shaft nolans chance but he froze
in his tracks then whirled he ran to
the door behind him and wrenched it
open

  get a heat suit he bawled to the
girl on the bed domes cracked
youve got maybe twenty minutes-less
if its a bad break

  his voice was a bellow-there was no
time for whispers no time and per-
haps no need if the dome had gone
avalon might be a city of corpses heat
suits or none before help could arrive
with fresh oxygen tanks from far-away
aylette disguise would hardly matter
then

  but he wasted no time in thought he
was out the door down the hall and drop-
ping into the cushioning grav-web of the
descending shaft in seconds guests were
waking in their rooms the corridors
were filling with shouting men and women
the shriek of emergency trucks filtered
in from the street and the hoarse bellow
of the alarm sirens multiplied the havoc
done to the peace of the night
	planet

  if he could get to a ship-

  but the slidewalks would be jammed
with panicky humans all with the same
thought a heat suit was his only chance
and the nearest ones he knew of were at
south lock at the base of the dome itself

  he swung himself out of the shaft
raced across the lobby which was already
beginning to fill with people intent on
escape he was out the door with the
van of them racing across a still empty
street toward south lock

  a slim pale figure darted across in
front of him he moved to dodge past
then slowed momentarily as he saw who
it was

  steve only one man knew that name
-petersen

 pete what are you waiting for
come on-get a suit

  petersen sighed touched nolans shoul-
der to halt him theres no hurry pal
he said mildly

 no hurry the dome alarm-
petersen shook his head forget it
he said i turned the alarm in myself

toward what passed for morning in
avalon the confusion died down
the emergency cars were off the streets
the sirens had long since stopped wailing
and the last irate citizen had retired for
what remained of a nights sleep

  petersen came back from the window
of his shabby little one-room apartment
and reported on progress to nolan

  all quiet he said sure you wont
change your mind and lie down for a
while youll be needing sleep pretty
soon

  nolan swallowed the rest of his coffee
stubbed out a cigarette and shook his head
no time he said he glanced at his
chrono i figure on leaving in twenty
minutes youre sure wollers going to
be on that ship

  petersen grinned pretty sure he
said i have my ways

  you looked good on the deal last
night nolan said you and your
hammy ideas i would have got out with-
out all that

  petersen was serious not alive no
when i saw those apes coming down the
street i was pretty sure something was
up so i got on a phone-i got a friend

stories

works for wollers company and he reads
the boss mail-and thats what he told
me woller has to get back to the inner
planets in a hurry hes sent a bunch of
his company guards to pick up some stuff
at his apartment the only thing i could
think of was to turn in the alarm and
hope youd get out in the confusion
youre a smart boy but you aint dead-
eye dick friend you couldnt of fought
it out with five of wollers finest

  nolan inclined his head maybe youre
right you say something big seems to
be up 

  what else he gets a red-hot sealed
teleflash from aylette sealed mind you
-my friend cant listen in he cancels
the orders of the only ship his new com-
pany has in avalon-cancels all the cargo
contracts-and takes off in it in the middle
of the night for aylette hell be back
here this morning they say to pick up
those papers then theyre off again deep
space this time the clearance says
mars

  nolan nodded his face was impassive
but a slight crinkling of the lines around
his lean nose showed thought what was
woller up to

  it was curiously difficult to concentrate
on woller absently he found himself
saying and you dont know who the girl
was 

  my information dont go that far
petersen admitted he has a daughter
some place but she aint supposed to be
here now but whats your guess about
this she

  my guess is youre right nolan
agreed reluctantly there was something
about soft blue eyes and silk-fine black
hair that did not fit in the same picture
with woller	n

  peterson was looking at him shrewdly
with a dim light of understanding glow-
ing in his eyes and a hint of pity as
nolan looked at him petersen looked
away began fumbling inside his waist-
band

  whatre you doing nolan asked
curiously

  youll need money said petersen
he finished unbuckling and dragged out
an oiled-silk money belt without open-
ing it he tossed it to nolan here
youll have to bid high to get passage
higbw ayman

on wollers ship thisll help

  nolan nodded thanks he said
look i-

  petersen waved a hand airily forget
it as long as theres enough radium on
pluto for prospectors to find ill have
plenty money

  sure said nolan but the thanks
still goes he closed his eyes for a
second rubbed them then he blinked
rapidly took out his pyro and checked it
full clip save the one shell hed used on
the light last night twenty-three shots
he defdy slipped another cartridge in to
make the full two dozen then replaced the
gun in its shoulder holster

  youre going to get into trouble with
that thing petersen prophesied

  nolan shrugged ive got a name to
live up to a gunner has to have a gun
-and i kind of think im going to need
this one he glanced at the chrono
again and stood up stretching

  well good-by he said casually i
owe you a bunch of favors you wont
have to remind me

 course not petersen agreed
wouldnt do much good but ill sort
of mention it to your heirs

at the operations lock of the
avalon spaceport nolan opened the
money belt petersen had given him for
the first time he peered inside and
whistled

  the cards had been with petersen all
right the little man had carried a young
fortune around with him he tucked the
belt in a pocket with a mental resolve to
pay it back some day if he lived long
enough and went into the observation
room

  through the crystal dome he could see
the ship the only one on the field it
was a beauty-brand-new and glistening
by the look of her she was the latest
type pure gravity drive the rocket jets
used only for landing it had a name
limned phosphorescent on a dark panel
in the glittering hull dragonfly

  he turned and walked over to the port
clearance officer i have to get to mars
he said i hear this ships bound there
who do i see about booking passage
the port official scratched his bony head
its an unscheduled run he said and

of the void	

i dunno if theyre taking any passengers
but over there- he waved a hand-is
the second mate he might help you
thanks nolan walked over eyeing
the pallid short-bodied venusian indi-
cated the man was staring glumly out
of the observation panel

  you the second on the ship out there
nolan asked

  the man turned slowly and looked him
up and down yeah he said finally
what about it

  nolan allowed his eyes to narrow con-
spiratorially i hear youre bound for
mars he said lowering his voice any
chance of taking a passenger

  no

  nolan tapped a pocket listen he
said it isnt just that i want a ride i
have to get to mars ill pay

  the venusian laughed sharply and
nolan thought not for the first time how
superior environment is to heredity the
venusians like most of the systems intel-
ligent life were descended from earthmen
all right but the adjective that described
them best was fishy

  the second said pay you havent
got enough money to get you into the lock
of that ship

  oh i dont know nolan said easily
he took the money belt out of his pocket
flashed the contents for a second i meant
it he said i have to get to mars
name your price-ive got it

  the venusians eyes widened nolan
saw from the corner of his eye a skid
rocketing across the field it halted by the
dragonfly and the ships lock opened
two bulky heat-suited figures hurried out
of the skid into the ship

  what do you say nolan persisted
accelerated by the sight of the figures
one of them would be wollers thug with
the apparently vital papers that would
be the big one-the smaller might be a
clerk from his office

  okay the mate capitulated tell
you what itll cost you ten thousand
credits if its worth that to you all
right

  nolan shrugged wryly its worth my
neck he grinned confidentially

  the venusian grinned moistly back
payable in advance he specified now
	planet

give it to me and ill go out and arrange
the deal with the captain

  keeping a percentage of course nolan
thought but he only nodded and silently
counted out the money the venusian
grabbed it without checking the count he
said okay ill be back in a minute
and left

  nolan watched him struggle into his
suit and clamber across the frigid soil
of the field the lock opened for him
then closed again nolan sensed a sudden
uneasiness he almost jumped when the
port officer came up behind him and said
wouldnt take you huh

  nolan turned sure he said he
had to go arrange it with the captain
ill go out with him when he comes back
for his clearance papers

  clearance papers the official barked
good lord man theyve had those for
hours that man isnt coming back

ill

nolan swearing incandescently
flung his heat-suit voucher at the
officer grabbed the first suit in the rack
and was in the main lock waiting for the
inner door to close before he put it on
he had already sealed the suit and stepped
out on the field when he noticed what the
excited hammering of the port official on
the lock door should have told him

  the suit had only a single oxygen tank
in its clip-and the gauge showed
empty

  he hesitated only a moment his eye
caught a glimpse of the dragonfly etched
sharply against the black horizon by the
fields blazing floodlights its smooth lines
were suddenly blurred and indistinct the
grav-web was building up around it in a
moment it would be gone

  damn yelled nolan to the sole detri-
ment of his own eardrums already the
slight amount of air in his suit was nearly
used up but as soon as the web reached
full focus the dragonfly would blast off
and woller would be beyond reach for a
long time

  nolan swore fervently then sealed his
writhing lips to save air he set off in
a slow heavy trot for the shimmering
spaceship he was breathing pure carbon
dioxide and staggering nicely by the time

stormes

he pushed his way through the thickening
resistance of the grav-web to the massive
outer door of the lock

  his bulging eyes caught the lever that
opened the lock guarded by a scoop-
shaped streamshield he yanked it
blindly saw the heavy panel roll aside
stumbled in

  some member of the crew must have
been watching-someone with compassion
unexpected enough in a ship of wollers
the lock door clanged shut behind him and
clean air hissed in nolan tore frantically
at his faceplate and gulped deeply dizzy-
ingly

  the metal flooring shuddered he felt
an intolerable weight drag at his water-
weak body as the ship took off he hadnt
made it by much at that a couple of
seconds more and he would have been
left

  boy nolan gasped somebody sure
doesnt want me along on this ride

  the inner door was sliding open nolan
stepped out into a well lit corridor almost
colliding with the flabby bulk of the
venusian

  the mate glared at him darkly the hand
on his waist poised suggestively above the
butt of a pyro

  before he could speak nolan said
mildly youre a thieving louse but
im on the ship and i wont hold it against
you only-dont try that again

  the mate flushed the captain didnt
want to take you he mumbled i was
going to send your dough back soons we
touched ground

  sure nolan agreed having my
full name and address the way you do itd
be easy well skip it wheres my
cabin 

  you wouldnt call it exactly hospitable
the way the mate stalled as long as he
could obviously trying to cudgel his feeble
venusian brain into some plan for getting
rid of the unwanted passenger but nolan
finally got his cabin

it was the smallest and worst on the
ship of course but the ship was a
beauty nolan smiled in real appreciation
when he saw the room the furniture was
glow-tinted plastic the bed was covered
with earth silk

  beat it he told the mate and watched
highwayman

the door close behind him then he sat
down to chart a course

  woller might recognize him

  that was the first danger true nolan
had been reported dead and woller knew
nothing to the contrary it was only a
miracle that nolan wasnt dead in fact
only the incredible chance of his being
picked up in midspace where he floated
helplessly one shoulder brutally pyro-
scarred and half the air gone from his
suit had saved him then

  that had been one miracle for even
the ranging avid patrol boats hadnt been
able to find him after his mad leap from a
lock of the ship that was carrying him
to the moon

  but that miracle had occurred and
the second miracle was that the pleasure
craft that saved him was piloted by a
man who lived outside the law but had an
iron-clad code of honesty-who wouldnt
turn nolan in for the bounty money on
fugitives pete petersens scrawny shoul-
ders bore no wings but hed seemed like
an angel to nolan that desolate day when
hed seen the flare of nolans desperate
signal rocket and swung round in a wide
arc to pick him up eventually to take him
to the lawless safety of the belt

  to everyone but petersen steve nolan
was dead and the little shots of gray
now running through nolans dark hair
the scar that crossed one tanned cheek
gave him a new personality he looked
slender and dangerous as a lunging rapier
and every bit as cold

  but woller would have good cause to
remember nolan woller had sat there
in the courtroom back on earth hed
sat there the whple dragging week of the
trial with nolans eyes on him every
minute he looked directly at nolan even
while he was in the chair telling the lies
that linked nolan with the junta-the
secret revolutionary group of outer-
planet malcontents that sought to over-
throw tri-planet laws peace and order

  nolans lips contorted savagely as he
recalled that a traitor i his sole crime
had been that he knew too much about
woller his boss

  woller had been clever about it the
law itself had removed nolan a menace
to his lawless schemes when nolan on
his own initiative had talked and bribed

of the void	

his way into seeing a confessed and con-
demned saboteur of the junta for an inter-
view hed found to his sick astonishment
that the man was one he had seen in
wollers own office not two months be-
fore

  hed been childishly simple about it had
confronted woller and demanded an ex-
planation woller had put on his friend-
liest face and promised one-later   

  and then woller had turned the dogs
loose

  within an hour nolan was in jail for
the bribery of the prison officials the
next morning came the incredible indict-
ment-- sabotage for the junta

  nolan grimaced recalled the careful
hideous network of lies and forgeries the
distorted evidence the perjuries but he
had been one man and woller represented
vast power

  then abruptly there was a knock on
the door jolted out of his thoughts
nolan started then called just a
minute

  this was the moment-and he had no
plan his pyro slid out into his hand
he broke it stared at the twenty-four
potent heat charges they would be plan
enough for him if he got a clear shot
at woller but if he should be disarmed 
if woller should suspect

  a moment later the pyro hidden be-
neath his shirt again he opened the door

it was the venusian second as before

  captain wants to see you he growled
come on

  the dragonfly was a single-deck craft
the captains cabin located topside of the
deck and amidships nolan looked around
curiously despite his internal tension as
he followed the venusian along the plas-
tic keel panel underfoot showed an infinity
of stars there was one large and bright
outstanding among the lesser stars nolan
recognized it-the sun parent star to the
farflung planet theyd just left now
it was dim and feeble but by the time
they got within sight of the inner worlds
it would be a ravenous thing reaching
out to destroy them with lethal radiations

  out of curiosity he asked when are
you going to opaque

  huh the venusian looked startled
for a second then his blubber-drowned
	planet stories

little eyes became shrewd oh about
orbit saturn i guess

nolan suppressed a sudden frown
he asked carefully say how do
you do it on these new-type ships anyhow
all the ones ive been on you had to have
the panels filter-shuttered before they lifted
gravs

  paint the mate said curtly okay
here we are

  he stood aside pointed to a door with
a glowing golden star embossed on it
nolan nodded and entered but his
thoughts were racing

  paint the panels it would take the
whole crew and theyd never get it off
if they opaqued with paint the ship would
be blind for weeks the filter shutters-
great strips of polarized colloid-were the
only solution to the problem of keeping
out the worst of the suns dread radia-
tions but admitting enough light to guide
the ship but they had to be put on
externally before the ship took off
mars this ship ports transparent as
they were would never dare approach
the suns blinding energies closer than
jupiter

  no wonder they didnt want me nolan
thought grimly theyre not going within
a hundred million miles of mars

  the thought froze in nolans mind as
he entered the captains cabin first he
saw the captain a tall demon-black
martio-terrestrial standing before his
own desk then his eyes flicked past
toward the florid-faced man who sat be-
hind the desk fumbling with a cigarette
lighter 

  and then for the first time in three
years he was face to face with alan
woller

  nolan might have showed a flicker of
emotion in his face heaven knows the
blast of iron hatred that surged up
through his body was powerful enough
but woller was lighting a cigarette the
second that it took him to finish it and
look up was time enough for nolan to
freeze

  vincennes is my name the captain
was saying whats yours

  matthews im sorry to have forced
my way onto your ship but i had to get
to mars

  woller looked up then and a sudden
trace of consternation flashed into his
eyes it died away but a doubt remained

  he stared intently at nolan then said
why

  nolan smiled easily a lot of reasons
-all of them personal who are you
woller stood up i own this ship he
said coldly i didnt ask you aboard
now that youre here youll answer my
question or get off

  the time for a showdown had arrived
well nolan thought it had to come some
time he was strangely relaxed

  he shrugged youve got a point
there he admitted well-

  he frowned and raised his hand as
though to scratch his head changed the
motion in mid-air and with the speed
of a hopped-up narcophene smoker the
thin-snouted pyro was in his fist slowly
traversing a lethal arc that covered both
men

  his voice was taut as he spoke its
your ship woller but im taking it over
woller-alan woller-look at me do
you know who i am

  woller stared deep into the icy eyes
confronting him the doubt flared again
in his own his jaw dropped slack his
brows lifted and he whispered nolan
nolan didnt bother to nod he said
grimly your hands-hold them where
they are you too vincennes ive
come a long way for this and i dont
mind killing you taught me that woller
a mans life is nothing mine was noth-
ing to you when it endangered the dirty
little treacheries you were working

  the life seemed to have gone out of
woller and left only a hulking pallid
carcass propped up by the internal pres-
sure of its own fear there was murky
horror crawling in his eyes

steve nolan looked at him and his
thin lips curled into a snarling grin
but those were only his lips strangely
there was no triumph in his heart none
of the fierce pleasure hed dreamed of all
those dreary years there was only dull
disgust and the hint of a long-dead hope
for rest again rest and the common
things of life on the earth which was
forbidden to him

  woller could die before him now and
highwayman

he would be avenged but woller alive
could say the words that would wipe out
the banishment would return him to the
green star that was home woller could
be made to confess-

  i ought to blast you now lie said in
a soft chill tone that was like a whip
to woller jerking him upright i ought
to and i will if i must but you can
live if you want to

  woller was licking his lips his face a
mask only his panic-stricken eyes alive

  you can live nolan repeated a
full statement about the junta frame in
writing write it out and thumbprint it
and well telestat it to the nearest tpl
station then you can have the lifeboat
woller and as much of a stare as tpl
gives you are you willing to pay that
much for your life woller

  wollers lips were stiff but he forced
the words through go to hell

  nolan nodded and the deadly weariness
settled down over him again i see your
point of course he said slowly tri-
planet doesnt come out here much and a
man is reasonably safe from them but
you woller - powers your life blood
and a man on the run cant have much
power i know

  his finger curled on the trigger of the
pyro and woller staring avidly des-
perately whitened at the mouth his lips
moved as though about to form words-
nolans trigger-sharp senses caught a
hint of movement behind him fool he
thought desperately the doorf he tried
to hurl his body aside out of the way
of the door that opened behind him but
he couldnt do that and keep the pyro
leveled on the two men at the desk he
saw woller exultant hatred leaping into
his purpled face plunging for a drawer of
the desk saw the door opening and some-
one stepping through then just as he
was leveling the gun on woller again
he saw the flashing swing of the other
man in the room forgotten vincennes
-with a heavy nightstone paperweight
held bludgeon-like in his hand leaping in
at himl he had no chance even to try
to turn the weight was coming down
on the side of his head ah he could do
was try to roll with it

  but the momentum was immense and
the heavy weight struck him down to

of the void	

the floor drove him headlong into uncon-
sciousness   

somebody was kicking him nolan
groaned once then compressed his lips
as he remembered where he was

  he opened his eyes and rolled over
the blubbery venusian second was stand-
ing over him face sullen but eyes glinting
with perverse pleasure he raised his
heavy spacemans boot again-

  hold it said woller from the desk
they were still in the cabin

  woller got up came over looking down
at nolan his bearing was confident
again he exuded an aura of brutal power

  you should have killed me nolan he
said you only get the one chance you
see

  nolan silently pushed himself erect
his ribs were agonized where the second
had booted them and a blinding throb in
the skull reminded him of the captains
blow he was conscious that his armpit
holster hung light the pyro was gone

  vincennes had left only woller and
the venusian second were in the cabin
with him my only doubt woller was
saying is whether to blast you now or
save you for a little later when ill have
more time

  sure said nolan tonelessly if you
want my vote its for now get it over
with

  woller nodded that would be much
pleasanter for you i think ill save you
he nodded slowly then to the mate
take him below

  back down the corridor the mocking
stars still bright through the crystal un-
derfoot back and down till they came
to the grav room where the pulsing
whining generators spun their web of anti-
gravitational power

  we dont have a brig the mate apol-
ogized but i think this will hold you
in

  eyes warily on nolan he circled him
and opened a round metal door it was
an unused storeroom bare except for rows
of vacant metal shelves

  in you go said the venusian and
nolan complied the door slammed be-
hind him and was bolted

   there was a whine in the air he noticed
the singing of the grav-generators it
	planet

was not unpleasant  at least not un-
bearable he corrected himself but how
it persisted it was constant as the keen-
ing of a jammed frequency-modulator
high as the wail of a banshee

  he let his aching body slip to the floor
lay there without even trying to think
he raised his head for a searching second
but there was nothing to see bare
walls bare shelves

  he was helpless his chance might come
when the second let him out till then
he would sleep

  when had he slept last save for the
few minutes of unconsciousness it was
easily thirty hours he pillowed his head
on his arm   

  he moved his head uncomfortably bur-
rowed his ear deeper into his biceps that
damned keening he shifted restlessly
stopped his exposed ear with his other
hand that movement racked the beaten
ribs but the shrilling soft and remorseless
kept on it was enough to drive a man
mad  it was-

  he sat bolt upright eyes flaring angrily
that was what woller had planned

  it was torture-subtie undramatic sim-
ple but pure horrid torture

  nolans face was gray with strain it
was incredible that a sound a noise could
become a threat hed heard the same
sound a million times before though never
at such close range or from such titanic
generators but now-

  he began trying to fill his mind with
other things but there was no room for
thought in a brain that was brimming with
naked sound snatches of school-days
poetry long columns of multiplication
tables- they jumbled in his brain the
lines ran together and muddled were
drowned out by the wail of the generators
he gave up and sat there forcing himself
to be still while the sound hovered in
the atmosphere all around him his jaw
muscles taut enough to bite through steel
a great pulse pounding in his temples   

  flesh could stand only so much after
a while-he didnt know when-he was
mercifully unconscious

a volcano erupted under him and
awoke his whole body was a mass
of flame now head throbbing like the
jets of a twenty-ton freight skid chest

stories

and ribs as sore as though they were
flayed a sickening weight held him
crushed against the metal floor

  the roaring from without was the sound
of the rockets loud enough to drown out
the whine that had nearly killed him the
ship was landing and at once there was
a gentle jar then a dizzying vertigo as the
grav-web was cut off abruptly the rock-
ets died down and were silent

  everything was silent the change was
fantastic a dream nolan lying there
thought the silence was the finest thing
he had ever heard

  it didnt last there were footsteps
outside and the venusian second mate
entered on your feet he said curtly
the boss is ready for you

  nolan stood up cautiously his feet
were shaky but he could use them he
stepped over the rounded sill and followed
the venusians directions there were
men in the corridor some of them in heat
suits nolan wondered where they were
neptune was on the other side of the sun
-could they be as far in as uranus how
long had he been unconscious

  get moving repeated the second and
nolan moved

  the blessed stillness he was grinning
to himself as he walked along the corridor
listening for the lethal whine that wasnt
there any more when they got to where
woller space-suited and bloated was di-
recting a crew of men in the moving of
a bulky object woller noted the grin
he was not pleased

  enjoying yourself nolan he asked
unsmiling that will have to stop

  a grin stayed on nolans face but it
was not the same one it was a savage
threat woller looked at it and looked
hastily away

  stand him over in the corner he said
to the venusian second ill attend to
him right away business first

  the second jerked a thumb at the cor-
ner formed by the airlock door and the
wall of the corridor nolan looked in the
direction indicated and a sudden tic in
his brows showed a thought that had come
to him the red signal light winked out
as he watched the inner door had closed

  he stared through the transparency at
what was beyond darkness was all he
could see-darkness and the light-dotted
highwayman

outline of buildings in the distance just
beyond the lock was something that looked
like a skid with mens figures around it
his forehead puckered and his eyes re-
turned to the signal light now dark-

  the venusian second watched nolan
limp slowly over to the indicated posi-
tion his eyes narrowed hey whats
the matter he asked surlily

  nolan shook his head something in
my shoe he said he halted and bal-
anced himself on one foot poking into the
offending footgear a button i guess
he said as drew out concealed something
that he knew quite well was not a button

  he breathed a silent prayer and it was
answered the venusian grunted and
turned away nolan walked quickly over
to the wall by the lock light turned and
stood surveying the scene without interest
his hands apparently were linked idly be-
hind him-but behind his back they were
moving swiftly dexterously a clink of
glass sounded and nolan winced as a
sharp sliver cut his thumb then he stood
motionless waiting

  the men were shock-wrapping a long
casket-like object to judge by the care
they were using the contents were deli-
cate and the handling would be rough
nolan noted absently explosives per-
haps

  the last loop of elastic webbing went
around it and the venusian second pulled
it taut all right he grunted take
it away

  lock bawled woller as the men
picked up the bundle that was nolans
signal

  as slowly as he could manage he stepped
idly away from the lock away from the
signal light hugging the wall

  a deckhand not troubling to look at
the warning light across the corridor-
nolan mentally thanked his gods-touched
the release that opened the lock door
and-

  ravenous flame lashed out from the
wall

iv

nolan was in motion before the in-
candescent gases had died the
half-dozen men who had been in the cor-
ridor were either down on the floor or

of the void	

blindly reeling about even without a
proton-reflector behind it to focus its fierce
energies a pyro charge exploded on un-
armored men can do a lot of damage

  nolan blessed the hunch that had
warned of trouble the remembrance of
an old spacers trick that had led him
to hide a pyro charge in his shoe back
there in the stateroom still it had been
luck pure and simple that gave him the
chance to open the signal light socket
take out the lume and put the pyro pellet
between the contacts when hed got out
of range and the automatic warning as
the lock opened had touched it off-

  catastrophe hed known when to close
his eyes where to stand for safety the
others hadnt and so the others were
blind

  he grabbed a pyro from a writhing
wretch on the floor-there was horror in
him as he saw the seared face that had
once been that of the venusian second
he picked a heat suit out of the cubby
and was into it and in the lock before the
blinded men who had escaped the full
flare could recover themselves

  the lock doors took an eternity to work
but at last he was out in the cold black
open a hasty glance at the landscape
told him nothing uranus or pluto-it
had to be one of them that was all

  a man was just coming out of the skid
perhaps twenty feet away nolan clicked
on his radio waited for the inevitable
question-but it didnt come the mans
transparent faceplate merely turned incuri-
ously to nolan for a second then bent to
examination of the fastenings of the skids
lock nolan turned calmly and strode
off along the side of the ship when
he rounded the stern he broke into a run
heading straight out across charred earth
to a chajn of hummocks that promised
shelter

  how long would pursuit be delayed
late or soon it would come nolan
realized that he had no plan but he had
life and freedom

  he topped the first of the hummocks
scrambled down into the trough behind it
he was relatively safe there as he cau-
tiously elevated his head to examine the
ship and what lay behind it

  already-it had been scant minutes
since the carnage in the lock corridor-the
	planet

search for him had begun he saw a
perfectly round spot of brilliance fall on
the side of the ship then dance away
through the ice-clear plutonian night he
could make out the figure of a man with
a hand light scanning the belly of the ship
looking to see if nolan had hidden him-
self there they would quickly learn
the answer to that-and know what he
had done

  beyond the ship were a few dim lights
distorted by a crystal dome it was an-
other city-or not quite a city but a domed
settlement out here in the wilderness

  without warning a sun blossomed on
the side of the ship nolan stood frozen
for a split second then dropped cursing
theyd seen him somehow had turned
the ships powerful landing beam on him
but how

  a soundless bolt of lightning that
splashed against a higher hill behind him
drove speculation out of his mind nolan
frowned the ship was armed-he hadnt
known that installation of pyros in inter-
planetary craft was the most forbidden
thing of the starways but there was no
time for wonder

  as another blast sheared off the crest
of a hill nolan keeping low scuttled
away behind the shelter of the hummocks
his only safety was in flight armor
he had none the frozen gases that com-
prised the hummocks would never stop
the dread thrust of a properly-aimed pyro

  he fled a hundred yards then waited
silence he risked a quick look saw noth-
ing retired behind the shelter of the hill
to consider theyd suspended fire-did
they think him dead did they know he
had escaped

  or was there a hidden danger in this
it might be a ruse they could be wait-
ing for him to move to show himself   

  nolan shivered and absently turned up
the heat control of his suit he felt sud-
denly hopeless one man against-what
his thoughts unbidden reverted to the
girl he had left in avalon and to the
sordid fear that she might be what she
seemed nolans cheek muscles drew
tight and his face hardened woller
partly protected by his heat suit undoubt-
edly had lived through the instant inferno
when the pyro charge went off that

stories

was one more thing against him-the girl
nolan sighed

  and a faint reverberation on the soles
of his feet brought him stark upright
staring frantically over the sheltering
mound of ice a skid was racing down
on him

  before he could move its light flared
out spotted him

  and a tiny voice within his helmet said
dont move nolan you cant get away
now youll die if you try next time
you play hide-and-seek with me nolan-
dont leave your helmet radio on i

if woller had burned with rage be-
fore now he was frozen hp was a
blind man there before nolan his eyes
swathed in thick white bandages but the
hulking earthman with the pyro who stood
by his side and lean black captain vin-
cennes at the controls were eyes enough
for him

  but i wish i could see you myself
woller said softly his fingers drumming
idly against the wide fabric arm of his
cushioned passengers chair the ships
surgeon says it may be weeks before i see
again if i could afford to keep you
alive that long- he sighed regretfully
no i cant afford it he concluded
there are more important things though
nothing- his voice shook but kept its
chill calm - that would give me more
pleasure than to see you die

  we could save him woller vincen-
nes said pickle him in a sleep-box
like-

  be still vincennes wollers voice
was sharp ill ask for advice when i
want it

  a sleep-box-nolan remembered sud-
denly what they were small coffins large
enough for a man equipped with an
atomic-powered generator that kept the
occupant in a sort of half-death not
breathing or able to move but capable
of existing almost indefinitely without
food

  nolan wondered absently what they
were doing with sleep-boxes then gave it
up it didnt matter he cursed the
carelessness that had led him to leave the
radio on in his suit it had been simple
for the dragonflys radio-man to tune in
highwayman

on its carrier wave get a radio fix on
his position

  the skid swerved abruptly in a sloppy
turn and the surly earth man at the con-
trols halted it and looked around okay
he grunted here we are

  woller nodded take me out he
ordered nolan too

  nolan peered out the window absorbed
in self-recrimination he hadnt paid at-
tention to their trip he was surprised
to find gleaming metal all around the skid
they were in a heat lock-they had come
to the domed settlement

  the martian vincennes went first as
soon as the pressure gauge showed he was
safely outside the earthman gestured to
nolan he wedged himself wearily into
the air chamber closed the door he was
ready for a break when the outer portal
opened    but there was no break not
with vincennes and his ready pyro there

  woller stumbling and cursing followed
and the earthman vincennes opened the
main lock and they went into the dome

  there were two great ships inside dimly
lighted by a string of pale lumes overhead
nolan looked at the mass of them at the
rodlike projections clustered around the
nose and knew them for what they were
warships

  scaffolding was still around them they
were not yet ready for launching not
ready for whatever mission of treason
woller had planned them for but by the
look of them the day was close and
nolan was-awaiting execution

  one look at wollers iron countenance
under the tape showed that vincennes
hand tight-knuckled around the butt of his
gun was ample confirmation

  but the moment had not yet come
woller said are they waiting

  vincennes glance sped to a lighted door
at the far side of the hangar looks
that way he said shall i attend to
nolan first hes tricky-

  woller laughed softly hes used up
all his tricks well take him with us
alive he might come in handy hes
been out of sight for three years now
im just a bit curious where hes been
perhaps its somewhere we should know
about

  he groped for vincennes arm found

of the void	

it lets go he said we cant keep
the chief waiting

nolan was first through the door
he was in a small room where four
or five ordinary-looking people were sit-
ing around at ease one was in uniform
the others the perfect example of quite
successful businessmen

  is he here yet whispered woller
the martian looked around the room be-
fore he answered

  not yet cafferty-lieutenant brie-
searle-vremczyk thats all

  the dumpling - shaped soldier in the
gray-green of plutos militia stared at
woller what the devils the matter
with your face he spluttered

  woller answered before vincennes
could i had an accident brie he
snapped keep your fat nose out of it

  the dumpling turned purple but he
said nothing and nolan realized wollers
importance in this gathering this gather-
ing of-what

  nolan looked around quickly and the
answer raced to his brain an officer of
plutos defense forces-two or three well-
dressed men apparently wealthy with
something about them that shrieked
politico-and woller once overlord of
the systems greatest news-dissemination
agency still a man of vast influence it
looked like the back room of a political
convention-or the gathering of a cabal

  the junta

  it had to be the junta

  what they were saying began to make
sense a tall man in dove gray was
speaking

  were not satisfied candidly he was
saying woller youve had more money
than our resources can afford every-
thing youve asked for you got and what
have you to show for it three ships-
not one of them fit to fly

  woller laughed contemptuously can-
didly cafferty he mimicked i dont
care how you feel my moneys gone
right along with yours warships cost
money

  so do thousand-acre martian estates
shot the little lieutenant how much of
your money is in these ships-and how
much of ours is in your pockets

  woller turned his blind eyes toward the

stories

lieutenant and stood motionless for a sec-
ond then softly once again brie-
keep your fat face shut you are not in-
dispensable

  the pudgy soldier glared and opened
his mouth to speak-but an interruption
halted the quarrel the door opened with-
out warning and another man entered

  what he looked like nolan could not
guess he wore a heat suit with the hel-
met down the polar-plastic faceplate
was set for one-way vision even his
voice was muffled and distorted as he
spoke

  are we all here he asked the
others seemed to note nothing odd about
his incognito-did he always disguise him-
self nolan wondered wheres
orlando

  brie answered he was on mars on
the other side of the sun hes on his
way

  the mirror-faced helmet bobbed as its
owner nodded then it turned toward
nolan whats this he asked ad-
vancing

  vincennes gestured with the pyro his
name is nolan he said he tried to get
rough with mr woller hes dangerous

  dangerous the blurred voice was
angry then why is he here we have
enough danger as it is give me that
pyro

  this was it nolan knew and he tensed
his body for the leap he had to attempt
though he knew it was useless the man
in the heat suit reached for vincennes
pyro in the moment while the gun was
passing from hand to hand there might
be a chance   

  there were shouts from outside and
the sound of running feet the man in
the heat suit whirled bolt that door
he shouted bolt it now

  brie dazed for a second sprang to
obey then he turned his plump pale
face damp with sudden sweat what is
this chief he asked are we-is there
trouble 

  chief thought nolan so this hooded
stranger was the leader of the conspiracy
masked disguised like the bandit chief of
a flamboyant operetta

  the chief was laughing lots of
trouble he answered the dull shouting
from outside continued rising to a cres-

cendo as whoever was without pounded
against the door and found it locked
then abruptly it subsided the huge tele-
screen on the desk buzzed sharply the
solid little man seated beside it auto-
matically clicked the switch that turned
it on

  turn it off bellowed the man in the
heat suit but it was already working
the prismatic flare on the screen showed
no vision impulses were coming in showed
that whoever was calling was using a
sound transmitter only - a portable set
like those in a heat suit a voice said
sharply

  attention junta the man who claims
to be the chief is a masquerader kill
him this is the chief speaking now

v

doubt sprang into the eyes of every
man present it lasted only a second
-for the masqueraders action proved the
charge against him

  he grappled the pyro from dazed vin-
cennes sprang back fired a warning blast
that smashed the telescreen

  dont move anybody he ordered
nolan-take their guns

  nolan threw questions to the winds
sped to obey he found a business-like
little heat pencil in the inner pockets of
the chunky man a pearl-handled burlesque
of the service pyro in the gaudy gemmed
holster lieutenant brie dangled from his
belt nothing else-and his search was
thorough

  all set he reported

  good enough searle-are there heat
suits in this room

  the chunky man looked stricken he
nodded in that locker he said dizzily
pointing to the wall

  get them out nolan give one to
every man and put one on yourself those
outside will take their chances

  nolan raced to comply the stillness
outside the door was menacing while he
was dragging the suits out throwing them
at the men while they were putting them
on the man called searle was staring at
the masquerader with dawning compre-
hension

  what are you going to do he whis-
pered are you-
highwayman

  the man in the heat suit laughed
sharply get your suit on he said
you know what im going to do all
set  every man was garbed helmets
down ten seconds to seal them one
two three-

  he counted slowly and nolan watched
him with fascination at five the gaunt-
leted left hand came up to the butt of the
pyro worked the tiny chambering lever
half a dozen times nolan gasped in spite
of himself there were seven lethal pyro
charges in the chamber of that gun-
enough to blast down a mountain

  the count was finished through
nolans helmet radio automatically turned
on the mans calm voice ordered all
right nolan open the door and let
them in 

  nolan moved as his hand was on the
lock just as it turned and the door swung
loosely inward-

  blam the impostor swung and fired the
massive charge in his pyro at the thin wall
that kept air and life in the dome

  they were running over icy ground at
most there was a minute or so of advan-
tage-less if the men theyd left in the
room had other weapons concealed some-
where and still nolan didnt know who
his savior was

  all right now he panted over the
helmet phone give who are you

  the answer was a chuckle mixed with
gasping as the smaller man strove to match
his speed tell you later he panted

  hold it nolan broke in suddenly
recalling the oversight that had been so
disastrous before dont tell me show
me-and turn off your radio theyve
got tracers

there was a snort of sudden compre-
hension from the phone then silence
nolan looked to see the figure spurt into
the lead gesture ahead they were round-
ing the dome the bulk of the dragonfly
appeared with a big cargo skid drawn up
beside it the gesticulating arm of the
other man pointed directly at it

  nolan glanced around there was no
one following-yet

  the men hadnt had weapons then-
and those who had been outside would not
be pursuing anybody he tried to thrust

-planet stories-fall

of the void	

from his mind the recollection of what
had happened when the sucking rush of
escaping air had thrown wide open the
door he had unlocked and the tug of naked
vacuum gripped the men behind it a
dozen of them there had been hulking
brutes from the flight sheds of a systems
blowsiest ports and one man in a heat
suit faceplate mirrored like that of the
man nolan ran beside it is not pleasant
to see a strong man try to shriek in agony
and fail because the air has bubbled from
his lungs

  the outer door of the skid was open
and the impostor trotted in when nolan
was beside him he leaned on the lock
control ever so slowly the outer door
closed slowly the inner opened

  they burst into a chamber where a man
was just rising from a telescreen face
contorted with consternation and hate
hand bringing up a pyro from a drawer in
the chart table

  the pseudo-chiefs gun spoke first and
the head and shoulders of the other dis-
appeared in a burst of flame and sicken-
ing smoke there was no time for
delicacy ruthlessly shoving the seared
corpse away the stranger dove for the
controls touched the jet keys

  the ungainly skid shuddered then drove
forward the stranger opened all jets
to the limits of their power creaking
and groaning the skid responded the
dial of the speed indicator showed mount-
ing acceleration far beyond what the ship
was designed for

  nolan clinging with one arm to a floor-
bolted chair threw back his helmet and
yelled im ready any time whats
the story who the devil are you

  the impostor waved a hand impatiently
his muffled voice came take a look in
there there may be more aboard

  nolan grimaced and nodded he picked
his way over the jolting floor blaster out
to the threshold his groping hand en-
countered the lume switch flooded the
cargo hatch with light it was almost
empty a few crates the long casket-
like object he had seen in the ship noth-
ing behind which a man could hide

  nolan turned to see the masquerader
unzipping the folds of his heat suit with
one hand while he guided the careening
skid with the other he brought out a
	planet

tiny black box opened it to show a key
and a lever he thumbed the lever open
braced the box between his knees began
tapping the key rhythmically a curious
shrill staccato came from the box dee
dideedeedit didideedit deedeedit deedeedee
didee didididit-

  after a second he stopped waited then
faintly an answer came back from the box
deedeedee dideedidit-

  and silence satisfied the man closed
the box slowed the skid to a point where
its guidance no longer required complete
attention they had reached the ring of
ice hummocks that surrounded wollers
dome the skid bounded over the first
rise zoomed through that trough and the
next then the man kicked the rudder jets
it spun along the trough to where the
hummocks were highest then he cut the
jets

  he turned to nolan threw back his
helmet

  my god gasped nolan pete

petersen grinned you called it
boy he admitted dont i get around
though 

  nolan closed his eyes and tightened his
grip on the back of his chair the story
he said quick

  peterson shrugged how can i tell it
quick its long   maybe if i tell you
one thing you can fill in the details
whats the one thing

  i work for tpl

 tpl-tri-planet law that ex-
plained-

  nolan exhaled slowly i begin to see
he said i always did think you knew
too much for a guy that made his living
at cards

  petersen laughed my biggest trouble
he said wryly i cant win at cards
whatever i do its been quite a draw-
back to my career you can see how peo-
ple would get suspicious of a professional
gambler who always loses i had to keep
on the move

  nolans brain was beginning to work
again but listen he said how come
you didnt turn me in when you picked me
up-right after i escaped if you worked
for the law-

  petersens face grew serious boy
he said you gave us a lot of trouble

stories

you and your escapes we werent plan-
ning to keep you in jail steve any fool
could see you were being framed-fixed
court semi-pro witnesses but tpl
couldnt step in out in the open we
didnt know enough for a showdown so
you were going to be summoned to mars
for further questioning when we found
out all you knew you were to be taken
care of some way or other given a new
identity kept undercover until we were
ready to move

  and i jumped the gun

  petersen nodded i was in the neigh-
borhood heading for earth the tpl
man on the ship called earth base they
called me the ship had you spotted but
they decided not to pick you up base
figured that if you thought you were being
hunted youd keep yourself under cover
and we wouldnt have to bother and if
i picked you up i could pump you myself
nolan grinned how did you do
fine you talked more than a ven-
triloquist with a two-tongued dummy   
then you turn up on pluto just when
things are getting hot

  after three years of hiding in third-
grade ratholes for fear of the law there
was no bitterness in nolans voice just
a calm statement of an unpleasant fact
petersens voice was level too but his
eyes were alert as he watched nolan
that couldnt be helped steve you
know what was at stake

  abruptly the grin returned the whole
damned system thats all nolan said a
little proudly well  go ahead with
your story

  petersen shrugged he looked a little
relieved as he spoke you know most of
it oh-one part you dont know wol-
lers daughter-her names ailse-knew
about what he was doing she just found
out about it we had a maid working in
her home in aylette-she didnt generally
stay with woller they didnt get along
nolans brows lifted oh 

  yep ailse was worried silly she
even talked to the maid-not much just
enough that we could figure out what was
happening it seemed she was going to
confront woller with what she knew try
to talk him out of treason

  a real good idea nolan remarked
knowing woller-
highwayman

  thats how we knew where this base
was she told the maid oh you do know
where you are dont you on pluto
the wildest section there is north of an-
nihilation range

  how about this cockeyed disguise of
yours who is this chief you were sup-
posed to be 

petersen frowned dont know
exactly he admitted there are three
men it could be-theyre all connected with
the junta were pretty sure theyre all
on saturn and we got word that they were
rendezvousing here we knew the boss
kept his identity hidden by wearing this
get-up so i was detailed to cut in
nolan nodded then his thoughts re-
verting he said wheres the-wheres
ailse now

  petersen looked unhappy uh-i dont
know after you left we sent for her just
to see what she knew that might help the
maid went after her-and couldnt find
her shed gone out of town wasnt ex-
pected back for some time we couldnt
wait all the leaders of the junta meeting
here-it was too big a chance

  nolan said well what are we doing
about it theyre all there and theyre
warned and were out here parked on
the edge of nowhere waiting for them to
get up a scout party and grab us

  petersen turned to look out the window
in the direction of the dome he scanned
the skies carefully then pursed his lips

  well no steve he said pointing
take a look

  arrowing lines of fire were swooping
down from far into the blackness three
trails of white flame showed where three
ships were plummeting to the surface no-
lan turned to petersen with a startled
question in his eyes

  watch petersen advised thisll be
worth seeing

  down and down they drove faster than
meteor ever fell a mile above the ground
the jets behind died and yellow flame burst
ahead of them flaring quickly to white
they slowed poised and then in perfect
unison spun off to one side they came
around in a great circle and dived at the
ground again and repeated the operation
over and over

  and abruptly nolan saw what was hap-

of the yoid	

pening he was witnessing the systematic
annihilation of the domed settlement im-
mense bursts of fire from ship-sized pyros
were blazing into the ground the hum-
mocks prevented a clear view but nolan
could see from the reflected glare on the
mountainsides behind that the destruction
was frightful

  i called them petersen said softly
you saw me call them that black box
-its a telesonde

  nolan didnt turn fascinated by the
sight whats a telesonde he asked
absently

  a radio that carries neither voice nor
vision only one note short or long de-
pending on how long the key is held down
your great-great-grandfather knew about
it it was the first method of wireless
communication now its so completely
forgotten that when tpl researchers dug
it up it was adopted as the most secret
method of communication available
nolan nodded his head the ships
came around again and down this time
the forward jets were delayed when they
flared out they persisted while the ships
dropped gently out of sight they were
landing

  the destruction of the dome was com-
plete

  nolan turned away quite a sight he
said slowly they deserved to die of
course   

  steve

  nolans eyes narrowed suddenly he
looked at petersen yes

petersen for once seemed almost
at a loss for words he licked his lips
before he spoke steve-there are one
or two other things did you know that
ailse wasnt wollers daughter by blood 
nolan looked at him unbelievingly
not his daughter

  petersen shook his head woller mar-
ried a widow a wealthy one with a
daughter they didnt get along too well
the woman died some people thought
it might be suicide

  the quick joy flooded up in nolan
petersen saw it and his face grew somber
thats one of the things steve he said
the other one- hell this is hard to
say

  nolan stood up and the joy was gone


planet

stories

from his face damn you pete he said
emotionlessly dont break things gently
to me

  petersen shrugged ailse wasnt any-
where we could find her-and we know a
lot of places to look in the ship left to
come here she was at wollers home till
just before then woller sent men to
bring something from his apartment to the
ship i thought it was papers at the time
-but it could have been a girl so-where
does that leave ailse

  where nolan stood rocklike as the
thought trickled through the automatic
barrier his mind had set up where did it
leave ailse

  a charred fragment of what had once
been beauty a castoff target for tpls
searching pyros

  ill say it again steve you know
what was at stake if the junta had time-
well we didnt know what kind of wea-
pons they had there that was one reason
why i was sent ahead in that crazy dis-
guise if i had had time to scout around
it might have been possible to do things
less bloodily i didnt have time we
couldnt take chances

  there was no anger in nolan no room
for it ge sat there waiting for petersen
to start the jets and send them back to the
dome he knew how he would scour the
ashes hoping against hope and he knew
what he would find

  it would have been better he thought
almost to have died under wollers pyro
or the tpl ships if hed stayed behind

-if woller had put him in the sleep-box
as vincennes had suggested and he had
shared obliteration with her   

  the sleep-box the casket

it took petersen a full second to re-
cover from his surprise when the fro-
zen face of nolan suddenly glowed with
hope when he leaped up and dashed into
the cargo hatch it took him minutes to
follow him minutes spent in making the
difficult decision of whether or not he
should prevent a man from taking his own
life

  the decision was wasted he found be-
hind the scattered boxes of pyro shells
wedged into a corner of the hold nolan
knelt beside a long narrow casket fiber
shock-wrapping was scattered about no-
lans fumbling fingers were working the
latch of the casket lifting the lid   

  the shout that left his lips was deafen-
ing in the small hold petersen looked
closer tiptoed up-

  and all the way back to the waiting
ships of the tpl petersen was grinning
to himself though hishands guided the
ship skillfully as ever though his gaze was
outward at the flowing terrain beneath he
saw but one thing

  the tableau as he had approached the
casket and seen nolan face indescribably
tender shutting off the sleep currents
reaching for the ampoule of stimulant that
would revive the unconscious dark-haired
girl within

  you get four bucks for every three you pay

how can you lose
so here it is fall again and the newest issue of planet
stories in your hands we think youll like the cream weve
skimmed from the science-fiction milk bottle this time and
were pretty darned certain that your imaginations will be fat
and happy by the time everything is assimilated

following are some of the better letters received by this de-
partment in the past weeks have some fun with them get
mad be amused or just read but-when you are finished get
out the old typewriter and knock out one of your own for the
vizigraph for this is the one place in the world where even
bald-headed people can let down their hair

  however weve got a new rule some of youse guys are a
bit hoggish-so beginning with this issue the maximum limit of
any letter is two double-spaced typewritten pages pen and
pencil are not barred but legibility is necessary and double
spacing for proper editing is mandatory typewritten mis-
sives will have precedence over all others for they can be
edited and set into type more easily

  we have some original illustrations kicking around the office
and if the next crop of letters are exceptionally good we might
declare a bonus to those who have letters in the winter issue
one warning though books go to press so close together your
letters must almost of a necessity be sent to us within a day or
so after you read any issue help us and well help you

  as to the winners of the originals who should drop a card
indicating their choices from the spring issue they are

  -a e kinkade -dick hetschel -virginia l shawl

  well be looking forward to your letters so dont think this
department is for the other men and women-this is yours so
tell us what you like or dislike or just plain want well try
to fulfill your desires

first attempt

                                    san angelo texas

dear editor 

  although ive been a reader of science fiction and fantasy for
nearly fourteen years this is my first attempt at a fan letter to
any of them everyone seems to give their reasons for reading
planet so i might as well bore you with mine i believe in the
time ive been reading this type of magazine i have read at least
three times every one of them to appear on the market so nat-
urally when i first saw good old planet i bought a copy to see
what it was like as youve been told numerous times before
your first issues were not so hot and the only reason at first
that i continued to purchase it was due entirely to the vizigraph
now it is as much for the stories as the viz that i get every
copy i can

  enough preliminaries have been indulged in for me to come to
the meat of the matter mainly to what you owe this great
honor its this guy e f buchanon on a couple of points i
believe he is right referring to his bit concerning the artists


	planet

which as i know nothing about art other than i
either like or dislike i wont take up much time
with but to say that none of them vizi fans
know nothing about art is i believe a grave error
after all there are some people who have studied
art but do not make a living at it and others who
make a hobby of art and to me it doesnt seem
at all illogical for some of them to read fiction
or even to write fan letters now to the second
point on which i agree slightly that is his
paragraph on hack but then not everyone can
write stories still active criticism has a ten-
dency no matter how its delivered to increase
an authors efforts to increase the quality of his
stories to an extent that the word hack shall
not be applied to any work of his

  now for his panning the fans after all isnt
that what the viz and similar departments in
other mags are for to procure the readers
opinion of the material he has to read and if
they get a kick out of ribbing each other and hav-
ing a little innocent fun let them it does no
harm and i for one enjoy reading them e f b
must have had a disagreeable experience with
fans to have such a sour and near-sighted opinion
of them also from the sound of his letter he
must have come off second best maybe thats why
he no longer edits that magazine he seems so
proud of

  this ish of ps was really superb lets have
more stories like leigh bracketts jewel of bas
for some strange reason i have a liking for this
type of novel i always enjoy bond enough
said two shorts and the gods laughed by
fredric brown and the avenger by stuart
fleming make a photo finish for third they were
both well written and interesting right up to the
last paragraph i wont attempt to rate the illus-
trations as i said before they dont affect me
outside of like or dislike for those who do value
them however give no  to bill watson he
has lots of sound ideas better expressed than the
majority no  goes to guy trucano jr but
why the lone loco no  to joe kennedy for
a swell try you didnt do so badly either ed
show that to e f- b

ye editor

  feeling in a journalistic mood this fine day i
pen another letter for you to read to be fair
with you i must tell you right off that i think
seventy per cent of your stories are terrible

  but now dont go getting me wrong funda-
mentally you have a fine magazine although you
are spoiling it with all the putrid trash you are
putting into it

  take the spring issue for example there is
a sample of what i mean the only story that is
worth the paper it is printed on is nelson s
bonds novel wanderers of the wolf moon and
even that could have been better miss bracketts
novel was a disappointment to say the least and
the shorts well suffice to say that they were
unfortunately horrible therefore i shall say no
more about them

  the cover it was the sloppiest looking thing
ive ever seen on any magazine please give us
something that resembles a good picture

stories

  on the other hand bonds story somewhat
redeemed the issue but only to a slight degree
therefore i shall change the verdict from poor
to fair for that reason only

  that the winter issue was very good would
be a gross overstatement not that it was too
bad a fair cover usual fair stories nothing
exceptional

  ah but the fall number that i must con-
cede was very good with these successful stories

  	thralls of the endless night

  	prey of the space falcon

  	phantom out of time

  and the cover well that was something after
my own heart

  now i want you to understand the fact is
i would like to see planet stories up in the
world of science-fiction so i have deigned to
give a few suggestions behold i

  	how about a backcover illustration on every
issue for instance you could have artists give
their versions of people of other worlds or even
illustrate one of the other stories in the magazine

  	use some good authors not these amateurs
as you have been doing by good authors i mean
bond brackett binder repp ayre williams
rocklynne and kummer of course many ama-
teurs do turn out good stories too but lets not
have too many

  	print a special big issue of perhaps  pages
or more every once in a while what if it costs
a few cents more no paper ed

  	go bi-monthly ditto ed

  	use lynch paul morey ingels and leyden-
frost frequently maybe a little of bok

  	how about a two part serial by bond or
williams

  	lets have more inside illustrations we
want to see what were reading about looks like
on paper

  	on the contents page give the name of the
artist who painted the story and tell what story it
is portraying

  	use some character like the space falcon
as gene hunter suggested to build up a series

  	make the pictures and stories correspond
with the stories on the newsstand for instance
our eye is caught by the picture of the beautiful
heroine struggling in the grasp of some terrible
monster while the big brave handsome hero
comes battling to the rescue so we buy the
magazine mainly to see what happens then
what do we do we hunt through the book and
come out sadly disillusioned because we found
nothing that even hinted anything of the dashing
cover

  	have more love interest in your stories
thats what makes them more enjoyable i dont
mean the silly mushy kind but the decent read-
able type

  	keep some of the far-fetched junk out all
that complicated stuff that doesnt make an iota
of sense isnt worth reading

  i hope that after all this work you will at
least make use of some of my criticisms and put
them to some purpose

  in closing i must again repeat that there is
certainly room for improvement to console you
i will add that there is still some hope and if i
see even a little improvement i may continue to
read your periodical

sincerely yours

dear editor

  not since loyal m sanford a gremlin out of
the dim and distant past wrote you his thoroughly
nauseating yes thats the only word i can see fit
to use note has a letter within the pages of le
viz aroused any real amount of anger within me
or that was the case until i glanced into the
works of one e f buchanon as you can see the
first slur against his humble personage is the
usage of lower case letters they sir are far
and away too big to represent his character as
viewed through the offspring of his mental efforts
that letter in the spring issue

  in a way i shall feel hurt if this letter does
not see print in the past it was i and i alone
all modesty aside who took up the crusade
against the bitter caustic creature that was san-
ford twas i who openly denounced him yes
through my efforts sanford was put in his place

  a bunch of childish school age brats whose
training and mental processes certainly do not
warrant the assured air of knowledge which they
try to flaunt-   -quite buchanon assuming
that a good deal of you readers are under fourteen
or fifteen by a bit of a margin i am not one of
them-assuming that they are buchanon what is
wrong with that

  their essential stupidity is reflected in their
very words- now look buchanon-that is a
bit too far ive read many a letter by many a
fan-and there have been a good deal of them
that i have personally known to have come from
the pens of youngsters i definitely feel that
their selection of words their formation of sen-
tences-was extremely superior to your crude
petty mouthings

  they gain a certain amount of notoriety by
having their letters printed   -here creature
i think i have found the real angle behind your
letter in your tottering dotage you just had
to get a letter printed

  in their opinionated assishness   -stoop-
ing to such word formations buchanon is only
proof that you have tried to attract attention by
your foolish sensationalism creature you have
failed we of fandom are as you apparently are
not rational beings we see through your cheap
tricks of phoney sincerity we know that you are
nothing but a    ah well if my thoughts had
gone in where those dots are this letter would
have been slashed to nothingness

  smug conceit of those writers-and then we
skip a few lines-egotistical little fools-that
i suppose was the smashing climax to your let-
ter you poor misguided fool pardon ed-
i do hope you arc not deleting this too much
we are ed

  in conclusion let me say half in jest half in
seriousness if i were one to form a purge list
in a country where purging was a popular activ-
ity and you sir were a citizen of that nation
you would head the list

  wilbur ive never said a thing like this before
-but well-i sorta want you to print this letter
i wont feel right if it remains unseen by the
fans for i must know what they think

sincerely

dear editor

  first my thanks for giving me the opportunity
at a rebuttal by mailing me copies of the letters
received by you in regard to my first letter as
to the letters-and their writers

  what a nice little hornets nest i stirred rather
refreshing to see the children bless them rise to
the defense of their little droolings

  however they seem to be more concerned with
their little wounded egos than with the state-
ments i made milt lesser in particular seems
to be the child whose vanity is the most bruised

  tell the infant who is not quite fourteen or
fifteen that he displays no super intelligence in
his missive rather he is the perfect example of
the egotistical prattlings i mentioned some time
back

  modestly he admits that he cornered and
thrashed one sanford all alone and unaided his
attitude reflecting the beliefs of all readers of your
magazine quite a crusade by the way lester
what grade are you in in school 

  so conceding that lesser is a knight ready to
pluck the gauntlet and flap it in the dragons face
he still has proved nothing but his oerweening
ego placing himself as he did as representative
of his fellow fanatics

  and my statement of stupidity still goes as
written despite master lessers remarks he
again is the perfect example of what i mean
tsk tsk-nothing was said about english usage
or the lack of it dig a bit deeper sonny

notoriety please glass house people etc

  so master lesser is not an opinionated ass
well could be but i reflect wiv viewpoint while
this boy is the mirror that reflects the opinions
of all the others he says

  smug conceit perish the thought    and
of course i am a fool-but i dealt in facts while
this boy deals in personalities

  as to master lessers purge list the child
is not only egocentric but a menace to all the
things that the men of the united nations are
fighting for it is talk such as that which brought
about this war and talk such as that will bring
on another

  and supporting my contention so the little
dear begs to have hisjetter published good clean
fun eh letter all full of facts and figures eh i
no egotism displayed  ha

  i still think that your vizifanners are with
notable exceptions a bunch of moronic self-
praising egotistical little brats they do not
know the difference between plots and situations
they have a smaller conception of art they act
as self-appointed judges and critics of works
which they cannot do themselves-yet which they
can tear down with the criticisms of masters of
the writing and artistic fields their science
knowledge has been culled from pseudo-scientific
magazines and they could not begin to explain
the workings of a cyclotron much less any of the
other fields of science

  finally because i am tired of this tempest in
a teapot i desire to say but one thing if you
must gnaw at my throat then do it on the basis
of the things i stated do not be the children you
claim not to be and pound your chests because
your sweet feelings have been hurt you are nice
immature brats go back to your toys and
algebra i

sincerely

dear editor

i have been reading science fiction since i was
six i am now sixteen

today i was reading the vizigraph and i came
across a letter from a certain mr buchanon he
panned us adolescents unmercifully i dont
think he was quite fair in his criticism he under-
rated our intelligence and overrated his own

we do not write to this mag to inflate our egos
as he called it but to give sincere criticism

but dont misunderstand me there are plenty
of people who write into your mag who do not
grasp or appreciate science and i do not neces-
sarily mean adolescents

what i take exception to is the fact that he
implies that adolescents do not understand science
and would not understand it if it were crammed
down their throats that is not true

most of the young readers of science fiction
belong to some sort of scientific club or at least
are interested in science

if your mr buchanon can give opinions then
suppose you let us give ours

sincerely

dear editor

i have never written to planet stories in the
past but will try to remedy the situation in the
future

i am writing on the winter issue  you
may quote me suh we shall ed

first on the list is the vizigraph this is one
tiling that is getting to be more interesting than
the fiction mainly because some of the letter are
more fantastic  i really do enjoy reading it
though so keep it up

second is the stories in first place is cast-
aways of eros i liked this story better than the
novels though i prefer novels mainly for the
fact that it was a different type than the average
run of science fiction it is more on the order of
what can happen in the future give us more of
this kind please

second place in the fiction is the star guards-
man it was well told with plenty of action and
dialogue the rest follow in their places

no  crypt-city of the deathless one

no  conspiracy on callisto

no  destination-death

no  blackout

giffords ringer family is pretty good i re-
member when his first letter telling you of his
creation appeared in ps

the artwork is- - ----aw 

i havent any gripes just keep the good work
up and you dont have to worry whether or not
your readers are satisfied a lot of those gripes
that you do hear are mostly just a way some
readers get their two cents worth in

i have no suggestions now you can unquote

dear ed

  after reading the spring issue of the vizi-
graph i decided i could hold my own against any
of your full grown men i am only a  year old
female but i have more sense of good stories and
pics than any of your feeble minded zwilnik
dgxgmfpct the happy genius the fizical
rek or any other queer minded jerks

  now on to my opinion of the cover it is shot
it is out of proportions and does not look like
any of the stories i read in the book perhaps it
belongs to some future issue or some past issue
which possibly i missed where is the past artist
rozen he was solid no matter what any one
says

  now a list of the stories as i would rate them

  	wanderers of the wolf moon took first place
by a long shot yes it is really good i became
so interested in it that i stayed up until  one
morning just so i could finish it i was just a
little disappointed in the ending as i wanted
gregg to get crystal but i guess tina will do
for him

  	the avenger what a luscious beginning and
ending those stories with the gore are the ones
that usually interest me mostly how about more
of these reet stories by fleming

  	the jewel of bas rather interesting could
have been better did not make much sense kind
of fuddled up brackett has done far better

  	and the gods laughed took fourth because
it was a little different than most of the p s
stories i like this brown guy also the artist
clyne more of him and less of ingels would have
helped this edition ever so much

  the rest just came and i wont rate them be-
cause i consider them just stories not worth the
everlasting comments they will probably get

  i still like doolin better than any of your
artists he has something that some of these art-
ists will never get a neat style that can never
be touched it is jivie

  where is kuttner i was shocked to see an-
other issue of p s without kuttner this little
baby is really hep and that is good how about
more than just one joke by this guy guy clif-
ford the joke in this issue is praiseworthy
why not have him illustrate a couple of stories
some time just to add a slight comedy touch
say ed no letter should be this long but i just
had so many comments to make i had to use this
much room

  so long till next time

dear editor

  okay awright so you win unintentionally
you and your blasted magazine have been chal-
lenging me to write you a letter ever since its
infamous first ish and youve beaten me i you
are the victor and i the vanquished  wot
doesnt that strike a respondent chord no oh
well i at least have tasted of the bitter wine of
humiliation and i shall brood over my weak-
willedness for many weeks to come but you have
goaded me to the breaking point when you pop
up after such a long string of successful issues
with this spring offering when i first saw the
cover nestled snugly in with dime detective
gory mysteries and bloody bushwa i was startled
to say the least a new mag i thought not
suspecting for a moment it was my old friend
planet and after gazing over my shoulder to
make sure no one was watching me plucked it
gingerly from the rack winced as i caught the
eye of some prudent customer and laid twenty
cents on the counter with a scream that caused
the whole store to stare the sickening truth was
vividly brought home to me this fugitive from
minskys i thought how in ematkhtila did
she find her way to ps and ye gods the
bems the bems oh ishtar could this be
a science fiction mag dazedly i searched for
the name and sure enough as big as pie g i
ingels on the bottom as though he were proud
of the painting hah i g i is right these
ps babes you continually sport always seem to
be able to rip and tear their clothing everywhere
but the right places all joking and ackerpun-
ning aside it was by far your worse cover includ-
ing drake and thats really getting bad i my
ghu cant you have just one cover without a
rocket ship skirt handsome hero bems and
terrific dilemma  thats one thing that makes an
otherwise pretty fair mag appear so ultimately
cheap appearing that makes one actually ashamed
to buy it you claim to cater to us fans and ill
admit youre the friendliest pub on the market
but such goings on will never increase your circu-
lation with real fans take it from me

  stories

  the jewel of bas brackett has not once rung
the bell with me and perhaps i am doing her a
great misjustice but always have i been preju-
diced as to the female of the species and always
will i be thus but far be it from me-a small
minority if even that-to ask the editor to purge
ps free of such dyed-in-the-wool hack artists

  the monster maker ray it seems has
crashed every mag in the biz yep the boy de-
serves respect also he turns out a good tale 

  and the gods laughed not as much power
as brown usually carries yet made immediately
entertaining by the only good pic in the issue 

  bond just what the name implies bond
what i mean is bond is bond clear enuf 

  it would be wuth the twenty cents to read vizi
alone but a few letters griped me somewhat this
ish namely buchanons oh of course and
watsons mr buchanon proves conclusively
that he not the fans is the adolescent one of
the dictionarys definitions is youth and one can
be youthful in mind and in body mr b occupying
the former category if he had only taken a
minutes time to find out a few things before

embarking upon his supposedly adultly-critical
letter he would have been mighty surprised one
thing of the many he is obviously so confused
upon is the average age of the fan which is
around twenty of course we will find followers
eleven and twelve but also of fifty and sixty and
all both intelligent and perhaps more so since
they or rather we have the foresight lacking in
mr bs psychological make-up then our blus-
tering critic if you will pardon my candor states
that we know nothing about science

  well unnotables by willy ley henry bott
and ray cummings are stfans and doubtless they
could outtalk him walk over him and make quite
a bumpkin out of mr b there are others but
i am not one to haggle sure the falcon was
partly science and bonds chaos was adventure
but mr adult apparently gives no one credit for
any sense whatever something that will do him no
little harm in future years that is if he will
have any after the fans tear him apart how-
ever im no criterion of the fans so will let the
matter drop to be more ably handled by tucker
or sj or warner if hes still alive before
leaving mr buchanon id like to warn him afore-
hand about receiving any square boxes for xmas
that make an odd ticking sound not that he
deserves it but im naturally a peaceful soul
shut up lucifer

  next on the docket is bills epistle ive al-
ways been rather fond of b w but i must say he
is being unduly cruel to v r heiner who is far
more patriarchal than he mayhap he personally
dislikes vaughn but thats no way to settle a
petty or major for that matter argument
attempting to deface him publicly of course his
endeavor will only cause weathered fans to ignore
his next three or four letters but thats his biz
yes this is to defend vaughn because i think his
correspondence both personal and otherwise is
intelligent and should be treated as such sorry
bill but that was downright injustice how do
you think you would feel if such a thing were
written falsely about you eh 

  on the whole ps retains its only-average
standard in fiction and art and its superior depart-
ment section so cheer up we all cant be perfect

a dashing good day to you

  taking up my literary cudgel once again i
wade into battle warring against these smug self-

every now and then if buchanon will reread his

quite a few words to apply to himself read your

needed my friend are they to impress us with
your knowledge

  in the first place i admit i write just to get
my name in print and to tear down your ideas
in the second place if you are so perfect why
dont you do us one better and show us what our

way to prove your superiority and improve our

dear mr peacock

  i feel signally honored by miss bracketts in-
direct reference to my last letter in planet
however if she gaped at my reactions to her
novel i no less gaped at her interpretation of my
appraisal to give a zvord socio-political conno-
tations is more imaginative than science-fiction
personally i fail to find any radical or nazi tags
to such perfectly good english words as fumi-
gating and liquidation one of which was writ-
ten by me and the other by mr elosegui of los
angeles however the pages of planet stories
are hardly a medium for a discussion on political
philosophy

  there are two schools of readers and fans for
planet as there are for the majority of science
fiction magazines one school is devoted to the
ray gun slam bang adventure with strange
beasts and villains in space the other school
wants credibility the approach to scientific logic
psychological characterizations and good writing
but it seems that the powers that be at planet
beginning with mr peacock favor the blood and
thunder school as witness mr peacocks own
prey of the space falcon which although well
written and readable was out and out formula
i can enjoy this type of story but not when it
degenerates into a farrago of incidents masquerad-
ing under the title of a story if i have hurt
miss bracketts sensibilities a gentleman always
apologizes to a lady futile as apologies are but
i hope it has the desired effect our feelings
are hurt too yell apologize to us sir ed

  the winter issue of planet has recently
reached my hands at this late date the name
henry kuttner was a delightful surprise i
opened the magazine and sat back for an interlude
of enchantment well    lest i be accused of
being impossible of satisfying i will simply leave
crypt city of the deathless one to the devotees
of blood and thunder complete with invulner-
able men cannibal plants and plagues et al a
plague upon it

  to me and there is no kindness in art the
present volume of planet would have been less
enjoyable were it not for the short novel i found
way in the back of the book prefaced by a not
too good illustration i refer to the star guards-
man by albert de pina this seems to be the
first time that this author has appeared in planet
by himself and he comes up to my expectations
of him after reading star of panadur and alca-
traz of the stanvays although by no stretch of
the imagination could he be said to use a lot of
action and strife he has done something else he
has in the star guardsman really accomplished
a psychological novel which is something far too
rare in science fiction the author has the gift
of drawing his characters with such precision
that they walk right out of the pages of planet
stories his vivid descriptions are so fresh and
original that they match his grasp of narrative
now that i have read two of his stories in col-
laboration and this novel of his own i can say
that as a fiction writer of other world stories
he is unquestionably good from now on i
wont be too fussy what else you put in our mag

  i find that i began this letter with a rather acid
diatribe so may i finish with the suggestion that
the majority of fans who hitherto have been pre-
occupied with winning pics pay a little more

stories

attention to the problem of which way planet is
to go and less to their own selfish motives
every magazine and planet is no exception is
launched at first with a policy predicated upon
what the editors believe will most appeal to the
readers and so will more quickly boost the circu-
lation thereby increasing the advertising but
time passes and a magazine like everything else
begins to evolve old readers drop by the way-
side new ones become part of the reading group
new fans are added and the policy must per-
force begin to change in accordance with the
readers  desires else the magazine gets into a
rut time and again many fans and readers have
begged for more science and less plain adventure
translated into other worlds-less hacky blood
and thunder yet the editorial guidance has
not heeded the general outcry perhaps the pres-
sure has not been sufficient to effect the change
although the star guardsman seems to be a
feeler to gauge the readers and fans reaction
just as mr william conovers suggestion for off-
trail stories has been left up to the fans come
now fellers give stop trying to write clever
letters and devote at least one to give mr pea-
cock a final and incontrovertible idea of what you
really want as for me i want more science and
more psychological characterizations more fine
writing and credible adventure and no hacky
westerns with a science fiction varnish

  in view of miss bracketts reply to my last
letter may i add a final paragraph in order to
clear the atmosphere of any misconceptions about
so-called totalitarian ideas i have done and will
continue to do everything that i can to help the
war effort my family are all also busily engaged
in doing what they can at present one brother
is serving as an ensign in the navy another
brother after two years of active service which
included the harrowing experience of the two tor-
pedoings was given a medical discharge after
convalescence in two hospitals others in the
family serve regularly by selling bonds doing
red cross work and civilian defense i have
myself visited camps and posts of the various
branches of the service in many parts of the
country helping to bring entertainment to the
service men i am happy and proud to do so
deeming it a privilege to help with the furthering
of this gigantic war effort that in the words of
the great emancipator this government of the
people by the people and for the people may not
perish from the earth

  may i close with the suggestions that the
readers of planet take their copies to the nearest
service mens center when they have finished
reading them the boys enjoy them always

  a final word to you our vizi-ed the next
time i write i am going to be all sweetness and
light so help me no high horses and no acid
comments to plague your patience

sincerely

wilms herbert

dear sweetness and light

  one of the curious facts about youse guys is
that you class all fantasy mags by the same name
planet never has claimed to be science fiction
it is adventure laid in the future primarily and
the emphasis is upon people and their reactions
we think people are more important anyway
and so we publish stories with that idea in mind

science-fiction in wartime

  what is a science-fiction fan just someone
who has a taste for odd reading material no
the true s-f fan has vision daring vision he
believes that what will be is better than what
has been he sees the world as a place bursting
with raw materials and the people who will
work with them and will transform this world
into a better place wherein to live he has
faith in humanitys bright destiny

  we fans have read of ultra-solar battles in
our imaginations we have colonized the planets
we have thrown off the handcuffs of time and
space and have roamed in a wider world where
all good things can be accomplished by the appli-
cation of mans creativeness to the materials at
hand were that kind of people we believe
that a better world can and will be made

  dictators are no news to us we have met
them in every guise the lesser ones have tried
only to seize the struggling earth-colonies on
some minor satellite somewhere    and the
boldest of them have tried to wrest control of
earth herself and all her commerce with her
far-flung colonies throughout the explored uni-
verse but they have all worked according to
one pattern they have as their aim the good of
the few at the expense of the good of all
even reading of them has aroused our ire be-
cause we recognize that their aims are counter
to all we believe in for we do believe that the
principles of democracy are just and right and
that it is right and just for a few of us to sacri-
fice some comforts so that all our fellow -
humans may have the so-called economic neces-
sities and a chance to dream of better things
and we are right

  miracles do not happen only in science fic-
tion they are happening all around us all of
the time man has become a space-eater   
and a time-eater once in our history san
francisco was four long weary months distant
from new york now it is an overnight hop in
a huge air-liner we have collapsed time by
our inventiveness which is only the application
of creative imagination to the materials at hand

  once upon a time what happened in the in-
terior of china was of little interest to us in
america and that interest was largely academic
it took months of even years for news of such
events to reach us how different it is today 
through the miracle of radio we follow the ex-
ploits of our own flying tigers with greater
concern than we do the actions of the people in
the house next to our own time and space
have shrunk weve conquered them

  and what is the result of this shrinking of
time and space how does it affect our daily
lives and what is our proper relationship in
this new world where china is only a fraction
of a second distant by radio and only a handful
of hours distant by plane these miracles these
children of our own human creativeness are
forcing us to the realization that the world is
a small place after all and what is more to the

point they are showing us that all of humanity

is one family not just one big happy family
as yet but that too will come it zvill have to
come the world has become so small that man-
kind cannot live happily unless he is at peace
with his neighbor even though that neighbor is
half-a-world away isnt that the ultimate ideal
of democracy  a whole world self-governed
where the good of all is our ultimate measuring-
rod

  we science-fiction fans believe that such a
world can be brought into being its not a
new idea with us weve read about it thought
about it and we believe that it can become liv-
ing truth and we dont want to be left out
we want to help bring it into being theres
the matter of how

  some of us work on farms some in offices
some of us keep the homes which are so dear to
us and where freedom is a fact in our daily
lives more of us work in factories where the
materials of this war for democracy are being
made still more of us are in the fighting forces
army navy marines wacs waves
spars etc but wherever we are weve got
to defend our own precious ideal of a world-wide
democracy    we have got to fight 

  there is one way we can all fight together
this is a very costly war it has cost billions of
dollars already and it will cost billions more
and it is up to us to produce those billions
weve got to dig down and dig em up i if we
do not there wont be any more dream of a
world united in liberty and justice    there
wont wont be any world worth living in and
the only free people will be the dead that
must not happen and it is up to us as science-
fiction fans we have a dream we believe in
that dream and we are going to do our damned-
est to make it come true

  it may take some sacrifices  it should
for anything worth living for i worth sacrificing
for weve done our bit    but we must do
more we must do everything possible and some
things which are impossible most of us have
been fans too long to believe that the word
impossible is anything more than a label which
means something we havent yet got around to
doing but were going to get around to it now i

 were going to buy more stamps and
more bonds were going to work harder
and longer and more efficiently because we
realize that every job is part of the big job on
our hands we s-f fans are fortunate because
this whole frightful business doesnt take us by
surprise weve read about it and thought
about it and we know that nothing less than an
all out effort will possibly bring our world-
dream out into the daylight of reality

  so lets go s-f fans lets show the world
that we know what it is all about    weve got
a dream to concretize and were going to do itl
were going to work harder fight harder and
buy more stamps and bonds and were going to
make that dream come alive right here and now

dear editor

  in general this last issue of planet stories
was good

  the cover was-as seems to be customary-very
inaccurate ingels isnt a bad artist but he doesnt
begin to compare with rozen just notice the dif-
ference between this cover and the cover for the
fall  issue the themes were almost identi-
cal but look at the difference in execution its
too bad that rozen has been ill his work is
really excellent

  i am not going to rate the stories numerically
i dont think its quite fair to do that instead
ill just comment on them

  the jewel of bas by leigh brockett was up
to her usual standard-that is high the writing
was exquisite but i have one complaint to make
the story was too short the idea of the tenth
planet and the sunballs was barely mentioned
and it sounded very interesting the androids
plan for conquest was menacing enough but it
seemed only lightly sketched in the character of
bas himself merited i think a much longer de-
scription ingels illustration was excellent as to
background but poor as to figures the people
were not clear at all

  stuart flemings the avenger was well-writ-
ten but i dont care much for horror stories es-
pecially if they go into detail with a different
sort of plot i would enjoy his stories greatly
ingels picture although accurate gave away
part of the plot werent any other scenes in the
story worthy of illustration

 the monster maker by ray bradbury was
really interesting perhaps the author might
write a sequel his characters were three-dimen-
sional-and human doolins drawing-he uses
shadow rather heavily doesnt he-neither made
nor marred the story

  robert abernathys saboteur of space was
beautifully written but i couldnt help feeling
that the story had been cut-ruthlessly-because
the plot especially near the end was far from
clear mr abernathys characterization is excel-
lent elias illustration was finely done-the facial
expresssions are specially good-why isnt elias
called on to illustrate more often incidentally-
referring to the story again-was the year  a
misprint or was it intentional if it was the lat-
ter i think an explanation is called for after
all this is 

  basil wells quests end was a good story but
isnt the title a misnomer i dont see any reason
why more of the orthan horde couldnt come
just to make sure and the fact that the orthans
didnt know how to lie and consequently didnt
recognize thigs lie seemed pulled out of a hat-
like a rabbit-to give a happy ending

  wanderers of the wolf-moon by nelson s
bond-i dont like the title much-was interest-
ing but-please restrain the caption-writer from
giving away the end of a story  to tell the truth
bond made his characters live-i actually found
myself disliking crystal andrews ingels-you
used him a lot this issue-drew the people fairly
well but the picture was inaccurate-again per-
haps you should adopt j franklin chidseys sug-
gestion to have the writers build their stories
around the pictures since the artists seem unable
to read please excuse my bitterness this subject
happens to be one of my pet peeves

stories

  and the gods laughed by frcdric brown al-
most frightened me-it sounded so plausible the
idea of an entity of some sort taking over a human
being isnt new but browns method of present-
ing it was-to say the least-original i liked the
story and i think ronald clynes drawing was
the best in the issue-why couldnt he do a cover
sometime

  i like the vizigraph-i think its the best let-
ter column in any science fiction magazine

  these are my choices for the best letters

  first e t buchanon i think the criticism
was a little severe but basically logical

  second alan mannion i agree with most of his
ideas but kattners crypt-city of the deathless
one reallv wasnt that bad it wasnt too good but
it didnt rattle and i wasnt at all inspired to
give it a bronx cheer

  third thomas r daniel not a bad letter and
the idea of presentation was original-and stuck to
the point

  this is the first letter i have ever written to a
science fiction magazine and i suppose it sounds
amateurish well i am an amateur anyhow

dear editor

  lets start with the cover it stinks the
colors are too lurid and flashy ceap looking
i liked those bee-yoo-ti-ful red and white striped
nightgowns at the right of the cover also that
type of lettering doesnt appeal to me

  the interior art was so-so i rate them in this
order ingels for bond warning if you use
him again keep him on the inside elias for
abernathy this illustrate is quite ok doolin
for wells clyne for brown ingels for fleming
ingels for brackett doolin for bradbury this
last is strictly from funny papers i cant
remember who said that giffords cartoon is
in a class by itself

  	wanderers of the wolf-moon by nelson s
bond good suspenseful adventure

  	quests end by basil wells a swell sequel
to quest of thig

  	the monster makers by ray bradbury
humorous in a way

  	the jewel of bas by leigh brackett if
you ask me i know you wouldnt but heres my
opinion anyway this one wandered so far off
trail it stayed off this off-trail idea is good
anyway lets see some more

  	saboteur of space by robert abernathy

  	the avenger by stewart fleming

  	and the gods laughed by fredric brown
oh no  it couldnt be the author of the star
mouse doing this-this-auugh  this was the
only fly in an otherwise perfect ointment

  le viz rolls smoothly up-hill with hair and
fingernail parings littering the trail my votes
are cast for  the original snace falcon  bill
watson  harrington the fizikal rek mainly
because of the belly laffs his missive conjured
in view of his comments i look forward to
heiners reply in the summer ish wheres oli-
ver  i never get enough of his interesting enter-
taining letters his autobiog was swell but it
isnt enough how about it chad

dear editor peacock

  having launched the spring issue of planet
with an experiment and the vizigraph thereof
with a blast from mr buchanon you should re-
ceive most interesting correspondence from your
readers

  having been born with a machiavellian sense
of malice i am enjoying in anticipation the effects
of the buchanon whirlwind in the serried ranks
of perennial fans as well as your discomfiture
when your experiment is vivisected by the sf
confraternity whose dislike of pure fantasy is
notorious however you have shown an almost
god-like disregard for the wishes of your readers
in the past so let us hope that the same sublime
indifference serves you as a cloak now in any
event you have managed to enliven what was be-

coming a dull routine and for that at least you

deserve praise

  the present issue of planet is remarkable i
havent the faintest idea whether or not you edited
it with your tongue in your cheek-or whether in
a moment of ennui you decided for once to issue
a number that corresponded to your ideal the
result however is admirable the short stories
were so excellent that they took away the honors
from the novels and the non-fan letters so
well-written that a show-girl wrote what was
tantamount to a classic bond despite his peren-
nial crash-marooned-in-an-alien-planet theme
forbore to use hack and the off-trail novel
written by miss brackett is reminiscent of c l
moore and therefore of excellence the cover
was so crude that it reminded one of those shows

that are so l----theyre marvellous and in

conclusion to finally overturn all norms and prec-
edents mr mannion wrote a letter in absolute
seriousness that in print became such sheer satire
its delicious  only one thing was missing a
story by that staff sergeant de pina who is so
often mentioned in the vizigraph and whose work
you so seldom print since he conforms to no
known rules of science-fiction that i know of
the overturning of the apple-cart would have
been complete incidentally is he still writing
or fighting or what had one of his stories
appeared in this utterly unorthodox issue it would
have been the final touch to have made it memor-
able for me

  if i may i would nominate for the hall of
fame as a real classic and the best in this issue
the short-story and the gods laughed superb
craftsmanship and originality easily gives it top
honors

  the monster maker takes second place nel-
son bonds wanderers of the wolf moon third
and the jewel of bos fourth length does not
determine merit in my mind by any means i
appreciate the fact that a novel demands greater
work than a short story but the short story form
in itself demands the highest degree of craftsman-
ship and often is more difficult to achieve than a
novel which in its leisurely pace and scope can
embody a greater extension of situation and
theme mind you i thoroughly enjoyed bonds
watulerers but no story in this issue left me with
such a sense of admiration and complete gratifica-
tion as did and the gods laughed

  with very best wishes i am

sincerely

dear georgia

  we resent the crack in your second paragraph
and were we as indifferent as you claim your
letter would have hit the waste basket along with
other critical letters for which we do not care

  books are strange things they cannot conform
to the whims of a few they must be edited for
the whole there will always be disagreements
upon what makes a book good and being human
we try to please the majority

  we believe weve been bending over backward
to be fair and well take no cracks to the contrary
in a personal way however this is your depart-
ment so you may write what you wish have at
it georgia

dear editor

  in the spring a young mans fancy turns to
planet stories-but not if the cover is like the
one for spring  once again the guy the
gal and the goons and such a smeared job that
they all resemble goons of one kind or another
especially the girl do you honestly think she
would attract any new readers  that too-heavily
made up face that expression that-shall we
exaggerate and call it hair arrraagh 

  artwork giffords cartooning ability continues
to amaze ronald clyne does a neat job and
your new import-ingels-has an odd and inter-
esting style that will be quite refreshing if you
dont use him too much

  blatt-column a lot of fans will quarrel with
me for this but e f buchanon takes first place
theres a great deal of truth in his letter we
the little egotists sitting in our remote fastnesses
and trying to dictate the policies of a magazine
without having had any experience in so doing-
theres a lot of truth in that idea as i shall dem-
onstrate in a moment by attempting as usual to
criticize the stories but on the other hand mr
buchanon please remember that every man has a
right to his own opinion and nobodys judgment
is perfect they panned milton all to hell in his
day-look at him now ditto keats gibbon poe
emerson etc etc etc judge not that ye be
not judged

  other awards go to mannion and watson
whose remarks on science in fiction etc should
clear the air a trifle

  and now to the fiction planets recent up-
swing from the mire of last may is still under
way it would seem just keep it up and youll
be up where you used to be

  a lot of fans are going to quarrel with me for
this selection but-number one goes to bonds
wanderers of the wolf-moon all right so it
isnt colnrful it isnt stf it isnt vast it isnt sev-
eral things--but it is a very well characterized
leisurely written human yarn bringing to mind
barries satire the admirable crichton in which
a party of british aristocracy is shipwrecked on
an island and the butler takes command it is
very smoothly done-its very smoothness disguises
its worth and will probably cause a lot of fans to
underrate it some tales build up to an explosive
climax that makes you sink back with a relieved
feeling this on the contrary made me think
aw heck it would have to end when it did
taint every story my dear watson that can
produce that result however i would advise a
little rest from the castaway theme mr bond
we dont want to run the idea into the ground

  the jewel of bas is a typical brackettale-one
of the better brackettalcs thats one of the
things youd been missing in ps recently-the
weird fantastic settings which were once
planets trademark the slackening up of the
raw action and the increased use of color have
had much to do with the mags renaissance bas
the sun-balls the machine et al were very well
done-yet the merely human beings were very
real and down-to-earth

  the avenger was a well-knit little yarn with a
real punch-but cursed with one of my pet stf
peeves a blurb that gave away the plot like
calls to like-did you have to tell us that much

stories

mr peacock more of fleming in the mag

please

  and the gods laughed well mr brown
you did a nice job here although the intelligent-
parasite lode is about worked out still the tale
is good however

  saboteur of space abernathy has an exciting
plot here but theres just something missing some-
where we want to see this author turn out a
good adventurous time-travel tale

  quests end please mr peacock youve been
in the game long enough to know how flat most
sequels fall quest of thig was no world-beater
anyway and this opus practically finished it no
more of thig and the orthans please basil
wells has done good stuff though let him do one
of your off-trail yarns sometime two years
ago they were his specialty

  last and least-the monster maker it hurts
to see ray bradbury-indisputably the most im-
portant author developed in the year -turn-
ing out such hack filler as this lets just be
kind and forget tmm shall we hes done some
remarkable short stories this past year and one
blotch on his record wont spoil it just see that
it doesnt happen again

  keep the mag climbing boys and remember-
we still want at least one cover sometime without
the guy gal and goons one space scene
wouldnt hurt you at all

dear editor

  did nelson s bond ever complete his science-
fiction omnibus which he mentioned in the fea-
ture flash in the fall  issue

  is it still possible to get a copy of planet with
bonds ballad of blaster bill yes ed

  im just recovering from my fourth and most
serious illness in three months and this is the first
chance ive had to read my planets thats how
busy ive been 

  at least half of the stories are very good the
balance quite interesting with the exception of
queen of the blue world which is the most con-
fused jumble i have ever read in  years vassals
of the master-world is the best story you have
ever published up to and including the spring
 issue im now ready for the summer
issue then the rest

  the rest of the dopes who clutter up the vizi-
graph with what they consider letters should be
incarcerated in this bug house

  the letters in the vizigraph deal too much with
illustrations and not enough with stories other-
wise the vizigraph is tops

  i miss the planets on planets covers regard-
less of what others think

  andersons cover for the winter  planet
is super but ingels cover for the spring 
issue looks too much like cheap jungle-wild west
stuff

  each issue of planet stories is a pleasant sur-
prise  keep it up i have every issue except no 
and no

improved trash

               west olive st
long beach long island n y
dear mr peacock

  as you may remember i sent you a letter
some time ago it was not published i on
bended knees thank you for that awright
folks take it easy i havent gone crazy--yet
it was a disagreeable nauseating and idiotic
piece of trash this time i shall try to improve
my style

  it is a chief hobby of mine to collect stf mags
so after borrowing a pound of tobacco and a
bloodhound from sherlock holmes i wished to
obtain a few back issues of ps so i gave the
pup a hefty smell of the winter  issue he
fainted and i dont blame him it left me with
such a sickening feeling as i have never had
before after i had revived him he headed directly
toward a little book shop on times square oh
yes i was in nyc at the time i went in tied
fido up and immediately asked an elderly sales-
man for the location of back issues of planet
stories holding his nose he pointed with a de-
plorable look in his eyes to a shelf from which
was emanating a thick screen of greenish smoke
borrowing a gas mask from a soldier i made my
way to the shelf i found two issues which hereto-
fore were not in my possession they featured
respectively black friar of the flame and war
gods of the void as yet i have not had time to
read them so you may expect a report on them
any day

  by now the gas was starting to come through
the mask so i gave the man  and rushed out
after mailing fido back to sherlock holmes
c o d i jumped on the long island railroad
what happened after that is history i sat
down and wrote you a letter applause

  now to get on to things in general around
ps

  i notice that although other magazines are
using finlay to a great extent your book lacks
masterpieces by v f how come wilbur
dont tell me hes rationed 

  the stories with of course a few exceptions
are mostly in the department labeled hack or
stories by is-a-hack asimov yuk yuk the
illustrations in your book rate singularly high
with me though the covers go as usual in
the waste basket take the winter cover for
instance it depicts i believe crypt-city of the
deathless one except for bright colors which
i adore it is lousy

  castaways of eros is a very good story it
opens up in my opinion an almost brand new
field in stf blackout had a theme which should
have been written into a novel or a novelet not a
short-short crypt-city etc was quite good
complaint izzat stf nice ending tho now to
that paradise of putrefiers the vizigraph the
v is the best readers department from here to
pluto true some of the writers like old
faithful milt lesser do get corny sometimes
wuzzat why do i call him old faithful
why you silly child i call him that because he
spouts hot air at regular intervals joke name-
ly -month intervals between issues of ps
speaking of hot air my quarterly ration is
almost finished so i must sign off

dear sir

  i will begin this-my first letter-with an
apology i confess that i sat down to write this
epistle with my pet gripes foremost in my mind
which is an unfair approach  the trutli is i buy
ycur excellent magazine regularly because i like
the type of stories you specialize in and find the
contents of your rag uniformly good

  i am the original imagination guy-and i work
nights on a wartime drillpress job-which gives
my brain plenty of time for idle exercise-so-i
hereby offer to think up plots for any or all of
your writers-absolutely free of charge and with-
out any wish for personal publicity of any kind
incidentally i have a couple of lulus stored in
my cerebellum which are fantastic but not scien-
tifiction  in case any one is interested

                sample no 
dr whosis is  years old a dilapidated prod-
uct of sciences nearest approach to solution of
the secret of eternal life lie is still the original
model-after biochemists prolonged his natural
span the brilliant surgeons stepped in and kept
grafting on new parts as fast as the old ones wore
out-hes had several sets of hearts and glands
and is getting mighty tired of the process-al-
though far from tired of life

  so he decides he has to hit on a process to
transfer the brain to another body and spends
the next thirty years perfecting an intelligent
robot to do the operations only a robot can
think move fast enough and in enough directions
at once to do this unimaginably complicated oper-
ation so he makes robot and goes to the moron
colony on some asteroid to get him a nice fresh
young body the morons have a way of getting
excited and bashing in each others heads so
he gets young again he also has it figgered so
as not to wake up until he is all well again the
robot feeds and exercises him in his sleep

  he goes back to terra and gets filthy rich fix-
ing up the scientific big shots he figgers should
not be lost to the world but word gets out and
he has to get into his flying laboratory it has a
brain of its own and astrogates repairs itself etc
without attention except for occasional confer-
ences with the boss and flies out to the uttermost
corners of space for a bit of rest and to keep from
getting torn to bits by the mob that wants to re-
main young

                  end of story
so you see i really mean what i say-and of
course any writer that subscribes to my unique
service neednt use my plots unless he she or it-
brr wishes to do so and neednt follow the plot
unless they want to so you see the whole business
is just too good to be true i

  some of the vizipanners have hinted that nelse
bond could use something new-who knows-my
next cerebral tempest might actually be new
stuff

dear mr w s peacock

no false hopes please bud i havent repossessed
the revered remington its still in durance vile

  notice the change of address im now a
georgia cracker of two months standing com-
plete with a georgia pecan a georgia peach
figure it out for yourself w s and a budding
southern accent

  w s i bet im the only jerk in georgia whos
received seven induction notices in two years it

coupled with the shortage of wacs and the fact
that the local boy scouts have replaced the traffic
signals locally my theory on the foregoing-the
lights are being equipped with a new type ray-
purpose to pick off any stray republicans who
wander down this way may get me in service

  thats a luscious hunk of stuff on the current
cover ws so help me robert e lee it re-

ahead of flash gordon the current crop of illus-

much the boys still arent in my class right

  you write and pat my back ill reciprocate
ws old pal i devised a new rating system of
from one to six stars but the notes are on back

cant remember whether its one of six thats
good anyway that brash outspoken individual in
the last issue scared me

  john campbell in another magazine states few
artists are really interested in science fiction
maybe thats true in ny but there are other
cities why restrict your field there are many
excellent pros scattered over the country many
probably interested in science fiction

  your fictions not restricted to the vicinity of

youve nothing to lose believe me

dear editor

  congratulations  your spring  ish was
magnificent the jewel of bas and wanderers
of the wolf moon were of course best but the
shorts were all good to my mind your mag is
the best on the market now it is truly a science-
fiction magazine lets keep it that way as for
the cover i personally prefer a good spaceship or
time machine rather than some half nude girl and
monsters and a hero to rescue her please let us
have some variety at least

  what has happened to hasse and de pina i
never will forget alcatras of the stanvays it
will always remain a classic incidentally the
best story i have ever read i have mags hack
to  was binders vassals of the master
world i would like very much to see more such
stories in your magazine by him

  i have hoarded five copies of moon pool by
merritt all in excellent condition and would like
to know if any of your readers are interested in
them

yours for an even better mag

dear editor

  ive just finished the jezvel of bas and consider
it a superb piece of fantasy for my dough
leigh brackett can write circles around the vast
majority of our modern s-f authors her char-
acters actually seem to live and breathe since
the tale was set off separately from the others
i have no kicks coming but when the fantasy
and the science-fiction are mixed up together in a
hopeless jumble i hit the roof
in the viz kennedy really deserves all three
originals but being a generous soul ill award
first to raym for his wonderfully wacky bit of
phantasy phiction excellent way to take revenge
upon an editor who turns down yer stories
please general washington dont leave us in
suspense continue it in the next edition of le
vizi second place i bestow upon harrington
tasty piece of yoomer third to lesser after
much pondering dont kid yerselves fellers-
the genial genius has one of the finest styles of
any letter hack around

  before going any farther allow me to heap
praise upon ron clyne for the best pic of the
issue doolin is worse than ever may i suggest
that you get boris dolgov to do some ills for
planet hes the most underrated fantasy
artist around-i rate him next to finlay altho
dolgovs style is a lot like bok he is superior to
hannes in many ways much as i admire boks
skill and imagination ill have to admit that he
is often inclined to make his figures bunchy and
out of proportion at any rate take a look at
dolgov   

  now for the main topic an incredibly narrow-
minded gentleman by the name of e f buchanon
mr b is inclined to believe fans are not essential
in the least i disagree for the following reasons
no  the fan field has produced many of our
top-flight authors artists and editors

  no  fans have sponsored hundreds of
worthwhile projects for the general advancement
of science-fiction exaggerating for effect huh
ed

  no  they write countless letters to the edi-
tors full of helpful suggestions which-beyond
any doubt-are an invaluable aid to those editors
in picking material for publication

  no  fans buy and back all the fantasy pulps
no  you have to have a sincere
and important interest in s-f to
write it well
oh sure stf mags could sell without the
fans to buy em but the quality of the material
would be much lower indeed buchanon says it
doesnt matter if the mags are  hack
hmm-m-m that statement is so thick-headed
that it doesnt even require me to contradict it

  agreed most fans are youthful the younger
we are the easier it is for us to appreciate good
fantasy are fans conceited good night
no s-f is our hobby were in it for the fun
it gives us

  about entertainment in stfiction personally
i think that a well-written intelligent story gives
infinitely more pleasure than a hunk of fast-
action hack a top-notch tale will be remembered
for years inside of  hours the name of the
hack will be forgotten so lets have less hack-
and less buchanons

sincerely
