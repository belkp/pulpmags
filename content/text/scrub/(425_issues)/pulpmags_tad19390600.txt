 if you had
  days to

 suppose the doctors told you that you had only ten
 days more to live what would you give to have
 another ten years of gloriously healthy life any-
 thing in the world you would say but unfortunately
 it would then be too late now while you still have
 many more years t live is the time to fortify yourself
 against later troubles

  are you getting paunchy around the waistline-worried
 about constipation heartburn short-wind nervousness
 continued tiredness or are you too thin underweight
 anaemic-always getting hacking coughs and colds fre-
 quent headaches then here are some interesting facts
 it will pay you to read

constipation is only one of the
worlds plagues

   one of the most common aliments today is constipation-so
 common that many people do not realize the serious results of it

 just think what would happen if the bewers of any city were
 clogged and did not drain out daily disease and death would
 break out everywhere that is exactly what begins to happen
 in your system when you are chronically constipated yet to end
 constipation is not very difficult providing you have no organic
 ailment

   but constipation-common as it is-is only one of the worlds
 plagues another is just the result of pure carelessness-many
 of us simply let our general physical condition go to seed

 we take our bodies for granted first we may begin to
 notice that we are getting a little heavy around the waist we
 do nothing about it suddenly we are amazed to find that we
 have a real pot-belly to our dismay we find we are pat

 and no wonder    because all of our processes are slowing
 up due to lack of attention and healthful stimulation just care-
 lessness we get-nervous jumpy flabby sluggish short-
 winded pepless we begin to look old feel old yet are not
 old in years even our hair gets lifeless caked with dandruff

 it starts to fall out and-another shock--does not come
 back in

you have made a new man
of me

    i lmve helped over many thousands of men of all ages and in all parts of the
 world win out over conditions like these men write me saying you have
 made a mew man of me

    my records show for example that x hare helped relioro of constipation nine
 out of ten of roy clients my method of body building tones up your entire
 system-actually overhauling your body i give exercise and life to those
 numerous little-used muscles in your body that begin to shrivel up and atrophy

 i do not believe in any weights springs or other old-fashioned dangerous
 methods my system of dynamic tension is natural and effective and may
 easily be applied right in the privacy of your own home

jim thorne fights ruthless spies as he speeds on a
mission of peril and mystery in war-torn china

chapter i
the trailing rickshaw

jim thorne became aware of
the rickshaw behind him in a
sudden intuitive flash as is the
way of a man whose life depends on
quick observation

  he had skirted the international
settlement to this part of the bund
with an uneasy growing sense of
being followed he paused to light a
cigarette in the shadow of a godown
and looked back there was a pas-
senger in the rickshaw behind and
the coolie pulling it seemed to stall

a complete action novelet




thrilling adventures

for time thornes eyes flared mo-
mentarily with a banked flame

  he walked on why should anyone
follow him certainly no one bound
on plunder was rash enough to way-
lay him here on the busy bund
why should they he knew of no
reason he was not important and he
was not rich he was merely an ob-
scure free-lance dealer in semi-pre-
cious jade antiques

 he had no enemies he knew of
and his business had dwindled to the
vanishing point as the conflict be-
tween the chinese and the japanese
dragged on

 he wondered how long he could
make a living if business conditions
in china continued to slump as they
had in the past few months he was
fed up with shanghai he thought
wistfully that if he had a small stake
he would return to the states-and
occidental sanity

  the rickshaw behind him idled
along well if anyone was following
him with felonious intent or made

one suspicious move he would put
the fear of god into whoever it was

  it was a sunny august day with
no dust blowing and the air over
shanghais bund had a tang and a
sparkle to it a singsong girl with a
white enameled face and a scarlet
mouth mincing along to a discreet
rendezvous eyed him with a direct
look and smiled an invitation to him
out of eyes as bright and hard as
onyx thorne grinned and walked
on stabbing a discouraging glance at
a group of whining beggars

  a professional letter writer bowed
and called an invitation complacent
fat chinese merchants passed him
riding in rickshaws he watched the
human motley with interest a shaven
lama an aged chinese houseboy
leading a young white child by the
hand a jittery english remittance
man a khaki-clad legation shimbo
a ravaged-looking russian with a
scowling monolithic face they were
all as unreal as figures in some fan-
tastic pageant

all right thome-stick em up hofher had him covered
flame of the peacock



 then suddenly he was aware of
commotion and excited voices behind
him he could see a growing huddle
of chinese backs in silk and coolie
cloth they were clustered around
the rickshaw he had imagined was
following him the voices arose
above the usual clacking and cluck-
ing

  then he saw a slim feminine figure
pulled from the rickshaw and heard
a shrill lyric protest more natives
materialized around something he
couldnt see

  thorne vent back at a run his cu-
riosity sharpened he shoved the
crowd aside and paused a big mon-
gol in european dress was tugging
at a small chinese woman she was
dressed in western clothes and was
trying vainly to break away from the

grip of the big mongol holding her

  her face was a pure oval the cheek-
bones a little high her black lus-
trous eyes beneath the exquisitely
arched brows were dilated and angry
but not afraid her small face was
thick with paint the lips a vivid line
of orange her clothes gave the im-
pression of wealth with glints of
gold and buttons of jade

  a queenly little figure and lovely
concluded jim thorne even by
western standards-vivid alluring
bizarrely beautiful she was east of
the east embodying its allurement
and witchery

 to his astonishment she whirled
to him except for the occasionally
slurred rs and an accent that gave
it distinction her english was per-
fect


thrilling adventures

 this-coolie pulled me from my
rickshaw mr thorne he is a thief
-a liar help me please

  for a second thorne was startled
she knew his name and he was sure
he had never seen her before in his
life he stared at the alluring face
meeting her eyes something flashed
in their startled depths a glow that
tugged at him strangely with a sud-
den intimacy born on the moment
he shoved the native crowd aside
towering over them like a giant

 the mongol still clutching the
girl yammered excitedly to the crowd
that he was of the police that the
girl was under arrest and he kept
trying to pull her away with him
when he saw thorne start forward
his furious triangular face contorted
and a knife appeared from his sleeve

 thorne swung from the hip he
felt the mongols jaw and teeth col-
lapse and the man went down upset-
ting the rickshaw and some of the
interested spectators jim thorne
grabbed the girls arm and literally
carried her through the crowd charg-
ing the line like a football player
men and women fell over one an-
other to make way before this tank-
like advance

  a tall white-turbaned traffic sikh
in uniform was coming at a run to
investigate thorne pulled the chi-
nese girl up legation street into the
lobby of the hotel du nord and
through the crowd there to the bar
they went through the bar at a run
and into mimosa street there too
fast for pursuit and unobserved
thorne pushed the girl into a small
cafe

 there was a young french sous-
officer sitting in a booth with a
golden-skinned eurasian girl other-
wise the place was deserted the
dinner hour had not as yet started

  jim thorne motioned the girl into
a booth and sat down opposite her
it was not paint on her face he de-
cided then but a natural clear pallor
gave that effect she had a small

well chiseled nose and a short upper
lip the girl was very pretty

  a waiter came shuffling over

  you get one drink first thorne
said to the chinese girl then well
have a bit of explanation whatll it
be

  old-fashioned she said to the
waiter i need it

  two supplemented thorne and
dont chisel on the whiskey

  the waiter left thorne turned to
the girl

  you were following me werent
you

  she nodded i was

  you knew my name he stated
whats it all about

the drinks came she drank hers
quickly smiled her almond-
shaped eyes surveying the cafe sharply

  you have a cigarette perhaps
she asked

  he nodded produced it lighted it
for her she inhaled gratefully the
enigmatic light flared again in her
obsidian eyes

  a habit i picked up at vassar
mr thorne she explained yes i
followed you i was on the point of
calling on you-with a chit-when i
saw you leave your hotel so i fol-
lowed seeking a chance to approach
where no one could see

  why he asked sharply
because she said it was not to
be known that i talked to you this
is the situation certain people know
you to be honest and fearless we
have need for such a man-an ameri-
can-who can do us a service he
will be very well paid-but there will
be danger you see i was watched-
i was stopped if you hadnt been
there i might have been knifed yes
even on the bund and that coolie
would have escaped in the crowd
oh like that eh said jim
sounds interesting lets have it
all

  you know the old manchu kwan
chow fang
flame of the peacock



  very well hes one of my best
friends here

  you know a man named markham
in san francisco

  yes i used to sell him a lot of
jade when business was good

  the venerable kwan chow fang
she went on has sent you a small
package a jade box i have it here
you are to deliver it to mr mark-
ham in san francisco he will pay
you twenty-five thousand dollars
american for safe delivery

  thornes smoky eyes blazed for a
moment lets have it he said
tersely and consider it safely de-
livered

she handed him a small paper-
wrapped package he slipped it
into an inside pocket the girl looked
around fearfully at the empty cafe
leaned over the table and talked earn-
estly for a few minutes thorne
nodded now and then

i get it he said finally leave
the rest to me whats your name
tso-yin she told him smiling
okay tso-yin he nodded again
i wont fail you-or the old kwan
i guess he knew that

  mr thorne she said i must
repeat to you-there will be danger
those who know you seem to think
it will not matter that is one reason
you were selected but i caution you
to be careful and on watch always
dont worry about me he reiter-
ated ill take care of myself and
the package too

  i will pass the word to our people
she said that you have undertaken
the mission they will watch over you
as much as possible trouble is com-
ing here fast as you know

  ill catch the first ship out he
paused and asked curiously tell
me-if this contact with me was dan-
gerous to the messenger why was a
girl sent

  before his direct scrutiny a deli-
cate warmth spread in her cheeks
her little figure drew back

  it was thought that less suspicion
would be created if a girl acted she
murmured and added tensely
watch fritz hoffler he works
under the protection of his embassy
and we can do nothing about him
he nodded i see ill watch him
if i see him can i escort you some-
where-see you safe

  no-please you leave me here
be careful jim thorne

  right thorne said tersely

  his gray eyes flared briefly scent-
ing adventure he bowed paid his
bill then swung out into the seem-
ingly deserted street

  thorne sensed trouble when he ar-
rived at his little hotel which sat on
the northern edge of the interna-
tional settlement firecrackers were
spluttering in the street always a pre-
lude to something in china and
china was in chaos he knew tense
to the point of explosion with the
excitement of impending events that
bothered him little but what caused
the slight frown on his lean face
deeply bronzed by years of asiatic
sun was the european who stood
across the street-a tall heavily-set
man with straw-colored hair

  he stood idly in front of a nearby
apothecary shop he looked like a
pre-war german baron with cold
milky-blue eyes and a mouth like a
wolf trap his pipe-clayed shoes his
white topi were faultless he wore
a suit of nankeen silk and carried a
swagger stick a big coolie stood
near him

  some instinct keener than reason
tolled a curious warning of danger
deep in thornes subconsciousness
he knew the man as fritz hoffler a
familiar figure around shanghai he
had heard that hoffler was a gem
trader and exporter others said he
was a spy another version was that
he was a japanese intelligence agent
no one was sure hoffler was a mys-
tery jim thorne looked him over
briefly keenly and did not like what
he saw


thrilling adventures

  in his room he tied the little
bundle under his left arm he touched
the  automatic in his shoulder hol-
ster and a bleak grin flitted across
his tight face his mission was sup-
posed to be a secret yet something
whispered to him that hoffler knew
of it

  a soft knock at the door made him
whirl with the feline ease of a jungle
cat thorne weighed close to two
hundred pounds but it was all tight
bone and muscle and he moved with
the flashing ease of co-ordinated steel
springs his curious one-sided smile
came to his thin lips he unlocked
the door and flung it wide stepping
back to one side

  a small chinese in civilian dress
wearing glasses smiled at him
thornes right hand paused at his
coat lapel arrested the little chi-
nese smiled again noting the signifi-
cant gesture

  mr thorne he asked in excel-
lent english thorne nodded with-
out invitation the chinese stepped
into the room closed the door and
locked it i came to warn you that
powerful interests have learned of
your mission unfortunately he said

  so said thorne well i can
take care of myself

  the chinese nodded mr thorne
is respected in china he acknowl-
edged otherwise this mission would
not have come to you much depends
on your fulfilling it his bland gaze
measured the inscrutable tall man in
front of him i am sam ying he
volunteered of general changs in-
telligence care to look over my
papers

  he extended a flat leather wallet
thorne took it and glanced through
it it established the little mans
identity he handed the wallet back

  seems to be conclusive he said
and just what is my mission mr
ying

  ying smiled his speech however
was sober

  the jewel that the old kwan

chow fang sent you to deliver in
san francisco to mr markham
means that china will have more
money to pay for defense we need
it urgently for there is grave trouble
mr thorne a new campaign will
start soon it may interest you to
know that what you carry was once
the property of the dowager em-
press tsze an the last of the man-
chus of the pure era it was known
as the flame of the peacock be-
cause of its color

  thorne stared this coincided with
what tso-yin had told him

  you say he began that others
know of this

  ying nodded they will try to
stop you we will guard you as best
we can but we cant follow you
everywhere

  why cant these people be ar-
rested

  ying shook his head china can
afford no further complications with
other nations - supposedly friendly
nations we have trouble enough
now if we arrested foreign nationals
now without positive proof there
would be trouble with powerful euro-
pean nations looking for an excuse
to further pick the bones of china
china as a nation cannot act openly
in this matter no state of war exists
you see its up to you and watch
fritz hoffler

  i see thorne said thoughtfully
sam ying bowed three times and
left his smile courtly

        chapter ii
        the blow falls

left alone jim
grimly decided that
he was going to earn
the money this ven-
ture would bring
him he needed it
badly he was not
bound by any diplo-
matic red tape that would restrict his
actions as far as he was concerned
flame of the peacock



it was a business deal with himself
acting as a trusted selling agent he
was determined to complete his com-
mission and it would be too bad for
anyone who tried to stop him

 he was not interested in chinese
or japanese diplomacy or the touchy
game of international politics he
was tired of the orient and needed
the money this mission would bring
him to set him up in business back
in the states his reputation he
guessed as a dangerous man to med-
dle with was known to those who
had selected him for this job they
knew he would not be lightly turned
aside that he would meet force with
force

 then another knock sounded on
his door

  who is it he called

  a chinese voice said in sing-song
come message illustrious maste
much hurry-fy tee

  thorne grinned savagely and flung
open the door but he was not quite
ready for the immediate fury that al-
most overwhelmed him it was the
big coolie he had noticed near hoffler
-and the native had a knife broad
and long the typical weapon of the
sampan iokie of the yangtze

  jim thorne caught the mans knife
hand in time and stepped back half a
pace he drove a roundhouse right
into the coolies solar plexus the
big native seemed to pause in midair
then he collapsed like an empty bag
and sagged to the floor he twitched
slightly then gasped and lay still

  thorne had once floored the heavy-
weight champ of the asiatic squad-
ron twice in one round before his
hitch in the navy was over the
sailors in the fleet had called jim
thornes fists sudden death

  the little hotel was strangely still
with a deep silence

 thornes eyes were on the silent
coolie the fellow was out for some
time to come and there had been
no time lost in attempting his life
a tight smile tugged at his lips

  he saluted the coolie ironically
packed his few belongings in his
grip and went downstairs there was
no sense in taking useless chances
he had best go to the american con-
cession in the international settle-
ment and stay there until he could
catch a ship out of shanghai

 he paid for his room and entered
the little cafe he ordered almond
cakes and miyaki spiced mellon
and some tea as he waited he
avatched the busy street chinese
groups stood around and talked earn-
estly

hoffler cool imperturbable
came in with another white man
they sat down at a nearby table and
ordered tea thorne measured them
both with a sharp curiosity hoffler
looked like a calm dangerous man
suddenly hoffler arose and smiling
disarmingly at thorne walked over
to the americans table

  hello thorne he said amiably
his eyes went to thornes bag on the
floor looks like trouble brewing
here eh leaving shanghai

  thornes face froze he did not be-
lieve in or even like diplomacy

  hoffler he said tersely lets not
fence i dont like it i dont like
you i know who you are and i have
an idea why youre here if you want
to keep yourself in one piece keep
away from me if you dont-ill
take you apart

 hofflers eyes narrowed and grew
glassy as skim ice he compressed
his lips and shrugged

 all right thorne he agreed
suavely if thats the way you want
it thats the way well play it ill
see you later

  not if im looking thorne told
him coldly i wont stand for any
prying into my affairs from you or
anyone else remember that if you
try it-it will be your own fault if
something unhealthy happens to you
dont say i didnt warn you
hoffler smiled with a grim hatred


thrilling adventures

 americans never do have any
tact he remarked cuttingly

 he turned and went back to his
seat he said something quietly to
the other man then they both left
the cafe leaving their tea un-
tasted   

 gllm thorne could never re-
member exactly how he entered
the international settlement there
had been a fearful explosion and he
had staggered out of the wrecked
dining room dazed an air bomb
shanghai was suddenly being shelled

 he walked without conscious ef-
fort as in a dream the shock of the
explosion had jarred him loose from
his customary control and he fought
the anesthesia of it as a sick man
fights an engulfing sleep

 soon he was dimly conscious of a
stream of chinese-men women and
children a solid train that flowed in
the streets carrying their pitifully
meager belongings dimly he knew
what had happened for it had been
expected the japanese had launched
another offensive intended to cow the
chinese populace

 then he remembered he felt sud-
denly of his side yes the package
was still tied under his arm relief
flooded him

  he had the jade box and the green
tsze an diamond safe enough but
how long could he keep it with war
breaking in shanghai

  the roar overhead increased vast
detonations shattered the air he
felt for his automatic it was safe in
its spring holster he went on

 he had no conception of time or
place and he could not shake the fog
out of his brain bubbling well
road the center of shanghais night-
time gaiety was littered with dead
and dying bombs fell from the sky
buildings shattered and people were
blown to quivering bits

 he saw chinese merchants closing
their doors and pasting lucky fu
paper triangles over them a gash in

his scalp was drooling blood down his
cheek he wiped it away and it
stopped bleeding big guns boomed
from the whangpoo he had to get
to the international settlement-he
had to fires were breaking out
everywhere

  he fought his way through a mob
to get to the hastily erected barbed-
wire fence that surrounded the set-
tlement uniformed shimbos helped
him through since he was a white
man men clustered around him the
wound in his scalp had stopped bleed-
ing but it throbbed fiercely he tried
to talk but nausea clogged his tongue

  he had only enough consciousness
left to see a girl taking him by the
arm her head was like a dim flame
he could not see her clearly

  this mans hurt he heard her
say as from a great distance

  whirling blackness rolled over
him and he pitched forward and
fell

 jim thorne seemed to swim up
from waves of darkness his sight
blurred then focused on a white ceil-
ing that swam with dancing black
spots he seemed to be in a bed and
a girl sat by his side she had red
hair and green eyes bright as jewel
jade her poppy mouth smiled

  better she asked

  thorne was still dazed he stared
at her until the girl flushed then
the pounding din outside claimed
him

  i think so he said what hap-
pened to me

  you passed out she told him
you had a bad scalp wound the
doctor dressed it last night

  last night how long have i been
here

  you slept all night the doctor
gave you something to make you
sleep and said youd be all right in
the morning are you feeling any
better 

  im afraid ill live thorne
grinned weakly

  memory returned he pressed his
flame of the peacock



arm against his side the reassuring
pressure of the little package caused
him to sink back satisfied

 where am i he asked and
are those big guns

 youre in our house the red-
haired girl told him slowly i had you
brought here when you dropped un-
conscious yes those are the japa-
nese big guns destroying shanghai
theyve been shelling the town con-
stantly she shuddered its in
ruins thousands have been killed

 who are you asked jim di-
rectly

 im ginger barret this is our
home my fathers john barret of
the international oil company

 thorne nodded he knew who john
barret was

 his head was throbbing fiercely
but he had to get up and send a cable
he had an important and difficult
mission to see through the dull
thunder outside never seemed to stop

 ive got to send a cable to the
states he told ginger barret i
have to catch the first ship out of
here

  the cable office is closed she
said somewhat grimly you dont
seem to realize that shanghai is a
shambles all night people have been
killed by airplane bombs and shells
from the warships the streets out-
side the settlement are running
blood she shivered all the le-
gation troops are at the barbed-wire
trying to keep out terror-ridden mobs
that are trying to break in here for
safety

  ive got to get out he persisted
stubbornly ive got to make ar-
rangements to sail for san fran-
cisco

  there are no ships leaving she
informed him my dad cabled from
manila for me to come there but i
cant dad and i are fed up with the
orient were going home for good

  he looked out of the window try-
ing to digest all this war beyond
the confines of the international set-

tlement he could see the flare of
huge fires streaking the morning sky
he heard the heavy crash of ships
batteries and the abrupt chattering
of machine-guns these were punc-
tuated occasionally by the hollow
roar of airplane bombs war the
crashing savage voice of hatred
who took off my coat he asked
i did

 he stared at her wondering what
she had thought of the package under
his arm apparently it had not been
touched his pistol and holster lay
upon a chair his eyes narrowed if
anyone uninitiated in the handling
of the jade box he carried attempted
to open it it would mean instant
death

he looked at ginger barret
again and liked her she was very
lovely she seemed to know what he
had been thinking about

 no one touched-what you have
tied under your arm she volun-
teered i imagined it was important
so i covered it up while the doctor
was patching up your scalp

  it is important he said very
much so my whole futures in that
package thanks for taking me in
miss barret

  thats quite all right youre wel-
come to stay here if you like quar-
ters are pretty scarce in the settle-
ment today

 no i wont bother you further
ill go on my way

 ten minutes later dressed jim
thorne was on the street he could
not believe his eyes death gibbered
everywhere legation soldiers were
busy at the barbed-wire thrusting
back the crazed hordes that sought
sanctuary within even as he stood
there a heavy bullet took a man in
front of him through the chest and
splashed through the man wilted
with a queer astonished gurgle

 thorne glanced up sharply and
saw hoffler down the street in-
stantly the man was gone again in


thrilling adventures

the scurrying crowd thorne checked
his impulse to follow it would be
useless in this mad horde with bul-
lets singing everywhere and no one
knowing if they were strays from the
fighting outside the settlement-or
purposely directed

  he left the settlement and went to
the non corns club but the rooms
were deserted at the consuls office
that official dizzy-eyed with worry
promised him and ginger barret a
berth on the evacuation steamer and
then thorne found out that accomo-
dations in the settlement were at a
premium and none to be had he had
to have a private room so he turned
back again to the barret home forc-
ing his way through horror-ridden
streets that were as unreal as a night-
mare

 ginger barrets chinese amah met
him at the door she was shrewd-
eyed wrinkled as parchment she
bowed him in and ginger came to-
ward him her eyes were frightened
and her lips trembled slightly she
tried to smile

  its horrible out there she said
ghastly

  dont look he advised if your
invitation still holds good id be grate-
ful if youd let me stay here until the
ship sails

 please she begged id feel
lots safer with a man in the house
there was a big blond man asking
for you after you left

  for me he asked sharply

 yes i told him you had left i
didnt like his looks

  he was watching her face his eyes
grim hoffler the girl returned his
scrutiny and smiled bravely even as
she winced before a suddenly accel-
erated burst of vicious gunfire in the
distance something curiously stir-
ring swept over jim thorne-some
kind of recognition that this was the
girl he knew suddenly that this
was the one girl he had always sub-
consciously been looking for

 ill stay he murmured dont

leave this house if you dont mind
ill use that bedroom in back for a
few minutes

 she nodded of course she
agreed

door of the back bed-
room and pulled off
his coat and shirt
his massive chest
was encircled by a
silken band and un-
der his armpit a
small chamois leath-
er bag was tied he
detached the bag and from it drew a
small jade box it was elaborately
carved and inlaid with amber ideo-
graphs and an engraved amber but-
ton protruded from the front

  thornes eyes narrowed contempla-
tively he had been warned that on
no account was he to press this but-
ton for a small fixed needle would
enter his thumb and kill him almost
instantly however he had been en-
trusted with the secret of opening
the box

  he gently pressed the sides it
sprang open on a crumpled nest of
rich chinese silk lay a green-tinged
diamond about an inch square the
green tint was slightly malignant
and it seemed to shoot spears of vari-
colored flame as it gathered the light
and reflected it about sixty or sev-
enty carats in weight it was not one
of the worlds great diamonds but it
was rich in legend and as the chinese
girl had told thorne it had once
graced the throat of the dowager
queen empress tsze an

  an american dealer had agreed to
pay two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars for it and jim thorne had
been selected as agent go-between
this money was to be used for the
defense of china a curious end for
a royal jewel of the imperialistic
pure dynasty
flame of the peacock



  staring fascinated at the big gem
thorne was suddenly conscious of
eyes watching him he tensed but
he made no move slowly he closed
the jade box and laid it on a chair
his automatic lay on the bed he
made no move to get it

  overhead whistled shell after shell
screaming across the international
settlement carrying messages of
death to chapei suddenly thorne
whirled and his hand streaked to the
automatic a twist and he was fac-
ing the one window at his back

  he saw a furious triangular mon-
gol face at the window obsidian eyes
that flashed from the jade box to his
face and remained in fixed surprise
for a moment then the automatic in
thornes hand crashed - to be
drowned by a providential burst of
gunfire from a nearby street

vacuous astonishment froze on
the mongol face at the window a
black hole sprang between the eyes
the head wavered and slid from the
sill as a marionette slides from view
jim thorne sprang to the window
the man was dead before he hit the
ground

  thornes lips were tensed and thin
not a mongol after all he thought
as he looked down but a thuggee
from the south one of those terror-
ists who killed silently there was a
thin silken weighted cord in the
dead mans hand that told the story

  thorne heard the red-headed girls
footsteps clicking hurriedly toward
the door

  are you all right she called
okay he answered coming out
in a few minutes

  oh i thought i heard a shot
lots of them he called theres
a little private war going on near the
jesfield bridge i guess be right
out miss barret

  this time he pulled the shade
down and took off his shoes with
his pocket-knife he worked furiously
for a few minutes then with the

jade box in his pocket he left the
bedroom

  i believe he said to the girl casu-
ally that a stray bullet hit a man
near the back of the house ill get
him out of the way

  gingers eyes watched him in si-
lence she shuddered and nodded
please do she said at length

  he did he dumped the dead thug
over the back fence of the isolated
barret home and then dragged him
to the alley corner a misdirected
bomb from a cruising plane had just
dropped and shattered part of a
building there and the people on the
street were scattering in terror
flames began to lick at the debris
thorne dumped the thug and ran
back to the barret home screened by
shrubs and trees

  ginger barret was standing at the
back door as he came in he slammed
the door shut and stood looking down
at her

  what was it she asked

  bomb he told her on the cor-
ner better stay indoors

  she walked back to the living room
of the bungalow thorne glanced
around him a graceful ming vase
stood on the mantel over the stone
fireplace a grin flitted over jim
thornes bronzed face he took the
little jade box out of his pocket

  this he told her is the reason
for some of the strange things youre
wondering about im supposed to get
it out of china-to san francisco-
and there are some people deter-
mined to stop me

  what is it she asked curiously
a talisman it looks like carved
jade with topaz engraving

  amber he told her it isnt very
valuable in itself but it contains a
valuable gem im going to hide it
here -he pointed to the ming vase
- until its time for us to board the
steamer for manila im beginning to
believe that it might be dangerous
for me to carry it around do you
mind

thrilling adventures

  of course not may i see it
you may he said nodding but
be careful how you handle it its a
deadly thing despite its beauty

  she drew her hand away instantly
oh she exclaimed i wouldnt
touch it for the world

  please say nothing of this to any-
one else he requested ill pick it
up before we board ship

  he placed the jade box in the bot-
tom of the vase and whirled as the
girl exclaimed they stared at each
other as there came a yelping high-
pitched cry from in back of the bun-
galow a throaty curse sounded from
a male throat

  thorne was out of the room like a
flash leaving ginger with a little
gurgle of astonishment on her lips
he was just in time to see the old
amah flung roughly to one side like
a doll as a big man went through the
door into the back yard hoffler he
recognized the tall man in a flash

  he made a flying tackle and closed
with the blond european both
crashed to the earth and thorne
caught the sharp glint of steel

  a knife his fingers closed on a
big wrist that had the toughness of
steel he bent it back to avoid the
peril of the knife his left fist thun-
dered home a short jolt to hofflers
ribs eliciting a startled grunt

  hoffler writhed like a python to
break the hold on his right wrist
wriggled free of thornes weight
cursed fervidly thornes hold did
no break he swarmed all over the
blond man until hoffler twisted sud-
denly to one side and darted his left
hand into his shirt

 something was thrown into jim
thornes face-something powdery
it struck his chin with a soft tap
and a cloud of pain engulfed him
his eyes burned with an agony that
grew intense his nostrils were stung
as by a flame and his lips seemed to
be afire

  he rolled to one side from the ex-
cruciating pain but did not release

his hold on that wrist the sudden
fear of blindness leaped into his
mind for the substance seemed to
threaten the destruction of his eye-
balls he bent back the wrist of his
antagonist in a concentrated fury
hoffler uttered a sharp cry and the
knife left his nerveless fingers he
brought up his knee into thornes
groin and twisted free

jim thorne came to his feet like
a cat jerking out his gun at last
but his burning eyes were blurred
with tears all he could see was a
dark running shape he cut loose at
it but without results

  pepper he realized what it was
then it had struck his chin his eyes
-squarely-his mouth a vast relief
flooded him when he tasted it and
knew what the powdery stuff was he
had feared it was some insidious ori-
ental poison but this would soon
wear off it had not been pleasant
for an active man to contemplate
even for a moment the possibility of
being without sight for the rest of
his life

  the struggle had been furious but
short eyes still streaming he turned
to the house he could see ginger
through the watery blur-but he
could see he wiped his eyes with a
handkerchief blinked and felt the
fires in them abating

  hoffler was a slippery treacherous
enemy one whom it would pay to
watch closely a white man who pre-
ferred a knife to a gun you had to
watch that sort

  a little cry broke from ginger and
her eyes were startled

  he-he-tried to kill you she
chattered aghast

  that was the general idea said
thorne grinning weakly

 oh whispered the girl in a
shocked voice i didnt realize that
-that-

  that the little jade box meant
things of this sort he added
quietly maybe i ought to take it-
i

flame of the peacock



and myself-out of here and not sub-
ject you to possible-

  im not afraid she said meeting
his eyes in a level exchange

  he stared into her jade-green eyes
with a look of wonder on his face and
a question pounded in his brain
lovely as a flower he thought but
there was steel in her too

  he did not answer her at once he
went back into the living room and
she followed for an instant his
sharp eyes swept to the ming vase
focused the pupils retracting then
a deep and secret mirth lay far back
in their frosty depths

  the chinese amah had picked her-
self up she came to the door di-
sheveled and frightened her eyes
went to thorne then to the girl

  what happened jim asked her
sharply

  my make prayer she choked ex-
citedly got plenty fine joss-he
kill japanese soldier-man maybe
then i look see-

what did you see snapped jim
see one piece man in hall quiet-
like listen to missy and marster talk
i make cry-he lun- she paused

  i see thorne said grimly you
say he was standing in the hall lis-
tening to us

  the amah nodded her eyes still
frightened

  where was he standing asked
thorne

  by kitchen door

  then said thorne he couldnt
see us

  the aged chinese woman shook
her head negatively muttered some-
thing and left rearranging her
clothes

  please ginger barret begged
dont leave me here alone until were
ready to go aboard ship

  okay thorne promised im
staying maybe thats best-now
how could that man have entered
this house so silently  ginger asked
i didnt hear a thing do you sup-
pose he heard what you said

  thorne shrugged i dont know
any of the answers just now miss
barret but i have a hunch im going
to find out

an abrupt lull in the firing of
the big guns outside brought an
aching silence the august day was
hot and the confused murmur of many
voices came to them the streets of
the international settlement were
crowded with refugees and residents
watching six bombing planes that
droned overhead

  lock all doors thorne told gin-
ger barret and dont leave this
house until i get back ill be back
as soon as possible but i must make
absolutely certain that you and i
have reservations on the next ship
out

  the chinese amah came in again
sobbing tearlessly ranging herself
near her young mistress as if for
protection thornes eyes flashed
momentarily to the ming vase and
gingers eyes followed she gave him
a barely perceptible nod as he turned
and left the house he knew with-
out knowing why that this girl could
be trusted she might be frightened
but there was hard steel in her
makeup

  he found a bicycle on the front
porch and mounted it every street
in the international settlement was
a seething bedlam of excitement and
was massed with moving refugees
white-turbaned sikh policemen tried
in vain to keep order the crowds
surged with a blind panic for the
lull did not last long and within
minutes the firing had started again

  thorne went through the barricade
of barbed-wire and sand-bags and
pushed his way along the dead lay
everywhere and wounded groaned
from doorways at pootung a chi-
nese anti-aircraft battery began to
sprout black blobs in the sky and on
the horizon lightninglike flashes told
of the heavy guns on the japanese
battleships anchored at sea off woo-


thrilling adventures

sung all spouting death at luckless
shanghai

  then in a back street for the first
time he noticed the vultures they
sat on a pile of debris and upended
stones black fat scavengers loath-
some and ominous by morning they
would be so weighted with the hot
flesh of men that they would be un-
able to fly he picked up a stone and
threw it at them and they lumbered
reluctantly into silent heavy flight

       chapter iv
       hoffler strikes

jim thorne
fought his way to
the consul generals
office and found it in
a feverish uproar
but he made certain
of the necessary ar-
rangements to leave
ent jefferson which
was to carry the first lot of american
refugees to manila

 he returned to the barret home
through a deserted back area trying
to make better time he entered a
narrow street hushed in the awful
tranquility of death a bomb had
fallen here gutting several houses
and the street the inhabitants lay
in the mute grotesqueness of sudden
and violent death

  the barret house was silent some
sixth sense warned thorne to ap-
proach with caution he did skirt-
ing the house and climbing in through
a kitchen window that faced the back
yard

  the chinese amah lay on the floor
to one side her head a bloody pulp
her pain-glazed eyes opened and
surveyed him

  missy she gasped in a whisper
take her-chop-chop i make pray
to velly good joss-

 who thorne demanded hoarse-
ly who where

 her eyes wavered in agony the
thin patina of death was on her yel-

low features she shuddered and lay
still jim thorne arose the amah
was dead the barret bungalow was
still and hushed

 up with your hands suddenly
snarled a voice behind thorne and
he whirled to face hoffler

 a big automatic was pointed at
thornes stomach viciousness was
written all over hofflers fleshy face
in the little glinting pig eyes in the
mouth screwed tight with an intense
satisfaction of cold-blooded triumph
jim thorne raised his hands his
arctic eyes unwinkingly probing into
hofflers he said nothing for it was
not his way

 got you cold thome gloated
hoffler i figured youd come back
this is as far as youll ever go again
came after the girl didnt you
well well-such chivalry still im
glad you came thorne very glad
his easy victory seemed to have
worked hoffler into a frenzy of vi-
cious triumph he threatened thorne
with various kinds of weird revolt-
ing deaths his thick finger lacing
around the trigger of the automatic
he seemed loath to terminate this
moment of triumph over a hated
enemy and savored each morsel of
conquest of savage satisfaction in
taunting jim thorne before he pulled
the trigger

 americans he sneered a na-
tion of weak-kneed gangsters come
to think of it why should i drop you
here it might be a good idea to
show ludwig and the girl what hap-
pens to interfering americans might
change the girls mind about a few
things eh i eat bad little ameri-
cans thorne

  so said thorne not afraid of
indigestion

 hardly

  dont you want to trade the girls
safety for a chance at the tsze an
diamond

  hoffler grinned ill get that any-
way i know its hidden somewhere
in the living room
flame of the peacock



  youll never find out where un-
less i tell you

  oh i think so its in that room
might save time however to have
the girl tell me where it is

  she wont tell you because she
cant she doesnt know and sooner
or later someone will show up here
this is the american concession
hoffler and american marines are
somewhere around

hoffler sneered in contempt
i wont be here long enough for
them or anybody else to interfere
he gloated and theres so much
shooting going on no one will pay
any attention to a little in here eh
shell tell me or ill take the room
apart i know its there

  she cant tell you you fool i
told you she doesnt know

  hofflers short laugh was sarcastic
youre not fooling me thorne
youre underestimating my powers
of-ah-shall we call it persuasion
hoffler im telling you the girl
cant tell you not that she would
even if she did know

  no taunted hoffler any girl
will tell anything when i get
through with them

  jim thornes teeth clicked shut
tightly his muscles tensed and ached
with the desire for physical contact
with this rat who knew no decency

  i can about imagine he clipped
tightly if you touch that girl if
you subject her to the slightest in-
dignity-

  yes what will you do about it
mr yankee doodle hofflers mouth
grew cruel what do you think im
going to do with you i think one
guess will be enough eh in this
madness the sound of a few more
shots- he shrugged turn around
and walk to that door id like to
show my friend ludwig what i do
with tough americans the girl will
be interested im sure once she sees
shell talk

  thorne turned and walked his

hands still held high hoffler walked
behind gun poised

  no tricks he snarled in warn-
ing no funny work ill blow your
liver out if you try anything

  but before the words were out al-
ready thorne had acted with the
speed of light taking his one slim
chance he leaped straight up into
the air and his hands fastened on the
transom his body swung up like an
acrobats on a trapeze he heard a
startled grunt behind him and hof-
flers gun blasted below then jim
thornes feet flashed back with the
speed and force of a battering-ram
and caught hoffler in the middle be-
fore he could shoot again or snap out
of his bewilderment he uttered a
coughing grunt and went down in a
heap his automatic slithering along
the floor

  thorne dropped and slid for the
gun then dropped to a crouch in a
corner with the automatic clutched
in his fist hoffler was out cold but
he had said that he wanted to show
ludwig what he did with tough
americans that meant that ludwig
was in the house and from what
hoffler had said ginger was here
too

  he waited eyes on the door that led
to the dining room of the bungalow
then from somewhere inside he
heard furtive footsteps his finger
tightened on the trigger

  hoffler a voice called presently
where are you i heard you shoot
where are you

  thorne growled something inar-
ticulate deep in his chest to make it
sound like the guttural voice of the
man he had knocked out

  the door swung open suddenly and
ludwig entered-the same heavy-set
man thorne had seen with hoffler
before he stood gun drawn peer-
ing suspiciously then his eyes wid-
ened and a yelp of fright came to his
lips as he made out hofflers prone
figure

  he whirled upon thorne lnstinc-


thrilling adventures

tively sensing that the american
was in the dark corner his gun
roared and a bullet bored in the wall
behind thornes head with a crush-
ing spat

  the gun in thornes hand bucked
and roared and ludwig jerked as
though he had been spun about by
some invisible hand he swayed
dropped his gun and crashed forward
on his face the bullet had torn open
his neck and shattered his spine he
was dead before he hit the floor

  jim thorne arose he tied the un-
conscious hoffler up with his hand-
kerchief and a tablecloth that was
handy he picked up the dead lud-
wigs gun and put it into his pocket
then he swiftly explored the house
there was no sign of ginger and he
began to wonder what hoffler had
meant when he had hinted that the
girl was here then he recalled that
though this was a bungalow that
the place had a cellar

  in a small room in the cellar he
finally found her tied to a chair
the place evidently had been a trunk
or storage room it had one small
window which was boarded up and
was illuminated by a small globe
which burned in a wall bracket

  thornes blood boiled sending
gleams of ominous flame into his
gray eyes the girl was securely
bound to the chair her clothing was
in disarray ripped from her showing
that she had put up a fierce struggle
her mouth was expertly bound but
her eyes flew to meet his round with
terror and humiliation she moaned
softly

  the binding cords had cut into the
delicate softness of her smooth skin
marks on her bare arms and face
showed she had not submitted with-
out giving a good account of herself
however futile she struggled and
twisted moaning with pain her face
streaked with tears

  okay ginger thorne said en-
couragingly dont be frightened ill
get you out of here in a jiffy

  her startled eyes recalled to him
his own appearance clothes awry
hair disheveled he had no idea then
that it was his eyes and the fixed
crooked smile that disturbed the girl
more than any other evidence of vio-
lence in his appearance-those cold
ruthless light-gray eyes like glass
that stared at her and what she saw
in their depths at the moment was
not pretty to look at though it was
not meant for her

  he shifted the automatic to his
left hand found his pocket knife and
began hacking the cords from the
girl he was totally unprepared for
the harsh voice that sounded from
the doorway

  all right thorne hands up-and
back away

hoffler again thorne cursed
fervently he thought he had put
the man out of his way but hoffler
had recovered consciousness and
somehow had managed to free him-
self and here he was his mouth
twisted with an animal rage he had
another gun in his fist a small auto-
matic again thorne cursed this
time at his own stupidity in not
searching the crafty hofflers pockets

  ginger seemed frozen with fright
she was almost freed but her mouth
still was bound she sat rigid star-
ing her eyes enormous filled with
horror

  thorne stood with his hands up
his strange eyes on the big hoffler
the mans features were contorted
with a frenzied hate that was scarcely
human and he was drooling at the
corners of his mouth with the insane
lust to kill

  drop that gun he spat hoarsely
bending forward

  jim thorne dropped the gun no
sense in doing anything else hoffler
had the drop on him true he might
shoot and kill hoffler but he would
be killed in return and that would
leave ginger here alone tied in a
house that already held two dead in
flame of the peacock



his pocket was the dead ludwigs
gun an ace in the hole

  get over in that corner snarled
hoffler advancing his gun pointed
back away from that gun damn
you

 what corner thorne asked
coolly not moving an inch his icy
eyes bored into hofflers glassy un-
wavering

  that corner snapped hoffler

  without thinking he pointed his
gun to one side and that was what
thorne was tensed and waiting for

  he leaped with the lunge of a
striking cobra just as hofflers gun
wavered the scant inch hoffler
switched the gun back and fired but
not before thornes left hand had
smashed forward catching hofflers
wrist and flinging the gun up the
bullet hit the ceiling bringing down
a shower of plaster

thorne drove forward heaving
a fist that caught hoeffler full in
the face it was a blow to fell an ox
the big man staggered back mouth-
ing foul curses-but he did not drop
his gun he closed with thorne in
a fury of bull strength his gun
cracked again-and instantly dark-
ness utter and complete enshrouded
them hofflers bullet had accidently
smashed the wall light

  thorne sent home another right
that connected with an audible thud
then dropped to the floor his alert
eyes had marked the spot where his
other gun had fallen and he wanted
that too his fingers groping swiftly
found it

  a streak of saffron flame stabbed
above him and to one side but he did
not return hofflers fire it was too
much in line with where ginger had
been sitting when he had last seen
her he could not see an inch in
front of him now but neither could
hoffler of course a tense silence
smothered the room after the shot
broken only by the muffled sobbing
of the girl

  jim thorne crouched and waited
the silence became eerie this must
be brought to a head quickly but he
couldnt shoot it out here endanger-
ing the life of the helpless bound
girl still he made no move no sign
he was waiting for hoffler to give
away his location by some movement

  he could hear ginger trying to
complete freeing herself could hear
her movements and her frantic
breath hoffler must be crouched
close to the floor he decided

  a slight rasp came from one side
jim shut his teeth tightly this was
what he had been waiting for hof-
flers nerves were none too good and
the waiting in the dark was driving
him to action-either to get away or
to bring the struggle to a conclusion
thorne reached out abruptly toward
the sound-and touched the sleeve of
hofflers coat

  instantly there was a shot from
hofflers gun a despairing moan from
the girl across the room thornes
heart contracted had she been hit
he fastened savagely on hofflers
gun wrist and heaved himself at the
big unseen body he whirled with a
sudden ferocious strength taking
hofflers arm with him hoffler
screamed with pain

 the arm went limp and the gun
thudded to the floor his left hand
groped furiously for thornes throat
thorne brought his gun down with a
smashing impact on hofflers skull
the man gasped shuddered convul-
sively and went limp he was com-
pletely out

 are you hit ginger barked
thorne are you hurt

  n-no her voice was weak trem-
bling but the bullet went past my
head

  a miss is as good as a mile
called thorne glad you got the gag
off

  he arose and felt his way over to-
ward the sound of the girls voice
hastily he finished unfastening her
feet from the rungs of the chair


thrilling adventures

then he picked up the chair and
smashed out the boarding of the one
small window a shaft of late sun-
light poured into the dismal room
hoffler lay silent his scalp bleeding
the girl stood hunched shivering
her horrified eyes riveted to the
bloody figure on the floor

 what happened here jim
thorne asked her

  they forced their way in and
asked for you she said and i told
them you were out this one wanted
to know where the jade box was and
i said i didnt know he told me not
to lie that he knew it was somewhere
in the house i wouldnt tell so-
she paused

  go on thorne said tersely

  i-dont remember much of what
happened after that i know i got
raging angry when one of them hit
my old amah and-

  i know thorne said gently he
could not tell her now that her chi-
nese servant was dead

  some american marines went
past she went on and i started to
scream but this - this big brute
struck me he threatened to kill me
if i made any noise or attracted any
attention to the house i still
wouldnt tell them anything so they
brought me down here and this man
said hed shoot me if i made the
least noise

  thorne nodded she went on

  i guess they thought i might
-she flushed hotly- that i might
have the jade box concealed on my
person she paused a moment they
almost tore the clothes off me search-
ing me and - and- again she
paused painfully embarrassed

  jim thornes eyes glinted frostily
i see you cant stay here ginger
have you any friends where you
could spend the night until we go
aboard

  yes theres dr hendersons
house he lives a few blocks down
a friend of dads and mine

thing she cried what will happen
to this man here

  hoffler thornes crooked smile
was fixed nothing hes out for the
time being im leaving him right
here come on-lets get out ill
come back later and pack in the
meanwhile i want to make sure
youre in safe hands its almost dark
and this will be a bad night in the
history of shanghai

chapter v

sam ying reappears

it was dark when
hoffler opened his
eyes he sat up
cursing then mem-
ory came back to
him the house was
silent that fool
american and the
girl were gone he
groped his way upstairs then he
risked a flash of a small electric
torch he carried

  not a living soul was in the house
there was only the dead amah-and
ludwig that was a shock to hoffler

  he made his way to the empty liv-
ing room wondering if thorne had
taken the jade box with him cer-
tainly the girl had not worn it on
her person perhaps thorne had it
after all still they might have left
without it no harm in having a
look

  he had no gun but there was a
long knife in the back of his waist-
band one needed a weapon in
shanghai just now with all hell
loose outside the firing was still go-
ing on out there

  his eyes roved the room and for
flame of the peacock



some reason fell on the blue ming
vase something clicked in his mind
he thrust his hand into it the neck
was too small for his big forearm
so he ruthlessly smashed the deli-
cate priceless vase on the fireplace
and there before him lay the pre-
cious jade box with the inlaid amber
ideographs

  he gloated fiercely thorne had
been frightened away without it
the fool was so much concerned with
the girls safety that he had forgot-
ten the priceless diamond

perhaps it was a board that
creaked perhaps it was the sixth
sense of the hunted that warned him
for he crouched suddenly listening
on impulse he reached up and put
the jade box within the metal cup
of the hanging chandelier then he
clicked out his flashlight

  he was reaching for his knife
when the lights flashed on all at
once and he saw a small chinese
standing in the doorway he was
dressed in european clothes and
wore glasses the chinese had a big
luger in his haid and it was pointed
at hofflers chest

  behind the first chinese were
three others similarly dressed all
armed hofflers glance flashed to the
windows that opened on the front
porch no chance he could see that
there were others out there

  keep your hands raised warned
the chinese in the doorway in eng-
lish if you move i shoot

  hofflers inherent insolence re-
turned he was in the international
settlement neutral ground and his
embassy would back any play he
made there was arrogance in his
sneer

  whats the idea he snarled
youre a fool sam ying you
know that if anything happens to
me my embassy will act at once
im supposed to check in every night
and if i dont-

  sam ying smiled thinly things

have changed hoffler he said be-
fore when there was no state of
war we hesitated now since there
is open fighting we act china comes
first-now

 what of it demanded hoffler
what have i to do with the state
of war or china

  i think youll find out

  i dont know what youre talking
about snapped hoffler

  too bad said the imperturbable
sam ying other chinese agents
have watched you and mr thorne
here in shanghai as much as possi-
ble unfortunately we lost you both
in the confusion very pretty young
lady named tso-yin thought we
might find you here she is very
clever extremely necessary you do
not interfere with mr thorne

 he snapped a clicking command
to the other three men not moving
a facial muscle with flashing speed
hoffler was searched and bound he
snarled like a trapped leopard
threatening disaster through his em-
bassy but sam ying paid little heed
his black eyes roved the room and
took in the shattered pieces of the
ming vase a thin smile twitched at
his lips and his shrewd eyes slitted

 you look for the green stone i
see he observed mr thorne is a
bit too smart for you cant find
green diamond eh

  there was murder in hofflers eyes
but also a shrewd glint under the
hooded lids that escaped the keen
sam ying

  if you dont release me hofflers
voice rose in sharp demand if any
harm happens to me ying my em-
bassy will raise the roof off china
and you know it were in the set-
tlement remember and this is neu-
tral territory

  hardly interposed ying sarcas-
tically listen

  the sharp crack of rifles and the
dull roar of big guns muttered out-
side somewhere in the immediate
distance there was the metallic


thrilling adventures

clanking of tanks rumbling to ac-
tion

  untie me roared hoffler ill
yell murder there are american
marines policing these streets-

  my men are all around the house
interrupted ying calmly no dan-
ger of interference hoffler

  hofflers mounting terrific rage or
his gradually growing apprehension
proved his undoing his face was
ugly with congested blood with con-
tempt

  if i dont check in at my em-
bassy tonight safe and sound you
know what will happen he roared
and ill stop thorne and that damn
girl from leaving shanghai you
know what the japs will do when i
talk

  yings face froze into a yellow
mask the jet black eyes glinted
like polished shoe buttons

  very well mr hoffler he said
coolly you will check in at your
embassy tonight-but you will not
talk and you will not interfere
with mr thorne

  he barked another command to his
three silent companions hofflers
face went pallid for he understood
chinese horror drenched his fea-
tures with sweat a mad fear glazed
his eyes

 no he shrieked no you
couldnt do that you cant do that
to me my embassy-

 at a nod from ying one of the
silent chinese struck hoffler down
with his pistol butt he went to the
floor unconscious the two others
took a hand a runnel of blood
flowed from hofflers mouth he
stirred but another expert tap on
the head from the same pistol sent
him back into the black depths of
unconsciousness

 five minutes later sam ying
nodded to his confederates his
glance swept the room his lips
smiled when he looked again at the
shattered vase he knew what hoffler
had been looking for but his clothes

and his person had revealed that he
had not found it yings smile broad-
ened he had great faith in jim
thorne

  at a sharp command the others
withdrew sam ying snapped off the
lights and went to the porch out
of the shadows came a tiny doll-like
chinese girl

  thorne she asked swiftly

 ying bowed he is not here
heaven-born and the fat pig has not
found what he sought nor will he
talk thorne to all appearances is
gone-and safe hoffler remains-
silent

  she nodded with the swift compre-
hension of a mind given to intrigue
the pallid pretty face and the black
eyes turned to blazing chapei

  no harm she murmured in man-
darin must befall jim thorne

  sam ying saw that the painted lips
smiled tremulously that the lucent
eyes were blurred

  yes heaven-born he murmured

 without another word the girl
stepped down from the porch and was
lost in the shadowy street in an-
other minute the chinese secret serv-
ice men had vanished and the barret
house lay in silence and darkness

  inside hoffler lay grievously
wounded and overhead in the chan-
delier  reposed the little jade box
where hoffler had thrust it sam ying
for all his sharp eyes had failed to
see it and knew nothing of it   

it was an hour before hoffler
stirred he groaned with a tortur-
ing pain and as memory flashed over
him terror gurgled in his thick throat
-and found a horrible confirmation
he had boasted that he would talk
and sam ying had ordered his tongue
cut out

  sheer madness swept him for many
minutes when he realized what had
happened to him he was weak from
loss of blood and his mouth was a
mashed pulp he lay groaning with
stupefied horror for many minutes
flame of the peacock



unable to muster his muscles or his
nerves

  finally when his first terror had
dimmed before the awful irrevocable
certainty he sat huddled venomous
as some huge snake wounded to the
death but still dangerous plotting
vengeances of such stark horror as
rarely entered human imagination

  he would never be able to speak

him strength the green diamond
it was worth a kings ransom he
would have plenty of money to prose-
cute his vengeance

  heat flooded his veins again a red
glow began to dance dimly in the win-
dows hongkew and chapei were in
flames good he wished that all
china would burn for his own pain
was now intolerable avarice how-

indo-china land of secret
mysteries and strange cus-
toms is the exotic setting
for perilous intrigue

again but he was still alive he
would live for vengeance and he
would have it if it took him all his
life he was a strong man and he
would survive this terrible wound

  the green diamond it was still in
the chandelier ying had missed that
painfully groggily he arose loss of
blood and nausea made him sway craz-
ily but he managed to get the jade
box

  greed and hatred a growing fan-
tastic plan of vengeance-all gave

ever drugged it somewhat excite-
ment dulled its edges

  he turned the jade box over in his
big fingers his sunken eyes were
aflare with a madmans fires this was
the box that held the priceless green
diamond of tsze an-the flame of
the peacock-worth a fortune

  he glanced around the silent room
should he open it here or take it with
him to his own quarters tense ex-
citement swept him the faint red
light that filtered in through the win-


thrilling adventures

dow was enough he saw the amber
button and jammed his thumb down
on it

  the button gave inwardly but a
needlelike pain lanced through him
he dropped the fanged thing in sur-
prise then unable to find it again
he staggered recklessly to the wall
found the light switch and pressed it
luckily the electric current in the
settlement had not yet failed he saw
the jade box

  he picked it up and pressed the
amber button on the edge this time
that was when he saw that there was
a fixed thin needle that came through
the buttons engraved center when it
moved inward-and a hoarse gurgle
welled to his bloody lips he had
lived in china a long time

  he knew the guile of the oriental
mind

  poison he had been poisoned
sheer terror made his voice rise to a
shriek then it dropped to a groan
his throat felt constricted and his
eyes bulged he felt the hot blood
surge through him in a mad riot he
dropped the jade box and it flew open
when it struck he saw then that it
was empty the green diamond was
gone thorne had outwitted him he
staggered to the door

  he was a strong man and so it took
him longer to die he fought the
poison vaguely horrified his lips
slowly retreating from his gums in
the sweeping agony he went down
to the floor and his heels drummed in
a mad spasm on the carpet as he was
caught in an uncontrollable convul-
sion

  froth and blood drooled from his
purpling lips and he retched once or
twice finally he lay still a horrible
grimacing dead man trapped by the
cunning of an ancient craftsman who
had devised this swift death for those
who sought to plunder the sacred
gem of his empress

  and from the hallway the dead
amahs glassy eyes seemed to con-
template the big hoffler with a grim

malice and a mysterious amuse-
ment   

  so several hours later jim thorne
found hoffler swollen and con-
torted his sightless eyes still mir-
roring the fright and the agony of
his death thornes keen eyes read
the story of the pulpy mouth hof-
fler might even have survived that-
but it was thornes trap that had
signed the big spys death warrant

  thorne stood a moment and looked
then he picked up the jade box and
put it into his pocket since he had
first seen the thuggee at the back
window at this house the green dia-
mond had been in the heel of his shoe
but he wanted the jade box as a me-
mento

  ginger was safe at the physicians
home and was to stay there until sail-
ing time tomorrow he had seen no
sign of the guards that sam ying had
said would watch him perhaps he
thought he had lost them somewhere
in the fantastic confusion that had
overtaken the international settle-
ment and all shanghai

  mindful of gingers directions he
went about packing all her personal
effects and clothes as well as her fa-
thers for ginger would not again
enter the house where the dead amah
lay he had borrowed the physicians
car and when he had finished packing
he piled everything into it on his
way back he stopped and informed
the civil authorities that there were
three dead people in the barret
house   

i

over four hundred americans
men women and children went
twelve miles down the whangpoo the
next day under constant fire the
president jefferson was anchored
some eight miles to sea and looked
like a speck on the horizon the fight-
ing had reached a new intensity and
shells whipped through the air most
of the time

there was not room enough on
board the relief ship for all the ref-
flame of the peacock



ugees so jim thorne was glad to
draw a cot on the deck while ginger
was to share a cabin with several other
women

  as the ship put out to sea bound
for manila thorne stood at the rail
looking at the distant shore he heard
the dim thunder of the guns saw the
cloud of black smoke that was the
funeral pall of the paris of the
orient it was his last glimpse of
china he knew for he was through
with wandering

  suddenly he was aware of ginger
barret at his elbow also staring at the
distant shore she was marvelously
lovely standing there and the sud-
den stirring of his blood told him that
this was no passing fancy curiously
it flashed over him that his father too
had married a girl whom he had met
in a distant land-his mother he
grinned kismet

  well good-by to shanghai gin-

ger said dad cables that hes never
going back were going to settle in
san francisco im glad of it

  thats where im bound said
thorne im going into business
there which all means that ill be
able to see you look at me ginger
she turned to look at him and some-
thing electric curious passed between
them they both understood jim
thorne knew with firm conviction
that here was the one girl he could
ever love-the girl he wanted for his
wife

  ginger he whispered i got you
into an awful jam and i didnt mean
to but im hoping youll let me
spend the balance of my life looking
after you to make up for it

  there was no affectation in her
manner as she looked at him with
steady eyes only honesty-and love

  i was hoping she said softly
that you would say that

     eering beneath the low-
hanging screen of leaves his
body prone on the ground
phillip leigh studied the ship his
lookout had reported to him that
she was a pirate he had no doubt
and that she belonged to one jean
descartes known as scarface he
was fast coming to believe

   many of the ships crew had already
 landed on the beach and were dis-
 porting themselves on the sand not
 fifty yards from phillip leigh a
 dozen men were setting up an awn-


pirates

pay-day



ing boats piled high with casks
drew in to the beach where a score
of rogues frolicking like schoolboys
lifted casks to their shoulders and
started off for the jungle

  leigh turned his head to the right
where lay thorpe his second mate
and oneil a seaman watching with
grim faces

  theyre here for water he whis-
pered

it was then he saw the boat in
the bow facing the stern sat a
tall figure splendid in black velvet
and plumed hat side by side on the
center thwart sat two women while
behind them crouched a huge half-
naked figure chocolate in color phil-
lip leigh knew the latter for a cima-
roon one of that strange fierce race
born of indians and escaped slaves

  some of the pirates ran out into
the water to draw the boat up on the
sand the man in the bow sprang
ashore and turned to assist the
women but they arose skirts lifted
preparing to step into the water like
a flash the cimaroon was before
them stooping quickly he lifted one
of the ladies on either arm and car-
ried them to the beach the man in
black velvet laughed and turned
about

  leighs left hand clenched into a
fist while the knuckles of his right
whitened about the barrel of his
musket there was no mistaking
that countenance of the black-velvet-
clad man once strikingly handsome
it was marred by a scar running
across forehead and cheek giving the
left eyelid a sinister droop and the
face a permanent leer it was scar-
face

  bitterness welled into leighs
throat three years ago in 
when news had reached him of the
death of his father and brother at
the hands of scarface he had given
up his plantation in virginia to re-
turn to the sea out of plymouth a
year later in the swan with a hand-

picked crew every one of whom had
a score against the pirate he had
spent two fruitless years scouring
the ocean for the buccaneer

 and now when a fight with two
pirates had left him battered and
crippled half his crew dead his ship
careened for repairs on the other
side of the island scarface stumbled
upon him true leigh had built a
fort on the beach with the guns of
the swan studding its log-and-stone
walls but only thirty men with
sound skins under the command of
brundage his first officer awaited
his return

  thorpes steady whispered curses
aroused phillip leigh

  quiet he whispered

 -saved himself a couple women
thorpe finished

  leigh thought of thorpes sister
taken by scarface on her way to the
carolinas compared with thorpe
his own call for revenge was slight

 you wont help them by getting
us discovered he whispered to
thorpe

  as scarface and his prisoners ap-
proached phillip saw that the women
were very young hardly more than
girls blue-black hair glinted in the
sun he caught the flash of great
dark eyes

  nothing like getting your feet on
land to put new life in you scar-
face said as he stepped under the
awning the hated voice was clear
in leighs ears and i like life in
my women

  the pirate sat on cushions brought
from the boat

  sit down he ordered

  seizing the taller girls arm he
jerked her to the cushions beside
him she whirled away her reply
was too low for phillip leighs ears
but her face was eloquent of loath-
ing

 o-ho the fire returns already
for that ill collect a kiss

 leigh saw the girls body bent
roughly against scarface she struck


thrilling adventures

at his head at the same time the
second girl flung herself upon the
man sobbing striking at cheek and
neck

 let me knock im off capn
thorpe was begging just one shot
leighs heart thudded jarringly
his breath whistled in his nostrils
his eyes were narrow slits however
he reached out a restraining hand
wait not just yet

  scarface had flung the second girl
from him and now he lowered the
fist he had raised to strike the one
he held in his arms

  no he said ill save a little of
that beauty for my men and when
theyre through with you miguel
there can have you hey miguel
how you like to be sweetheart to the
ladies you served

 leigh glanced at the cimaroon
with new interest evidently he had
been the girls servant but was a
pirate now he touched thorpes arm

  a shot from ambush isnt my idea
of an end for scarface he said
and wed have the whole crew on
our necks besides if he does what
i think he will when his water-party
returns we may have a chance to help
those girls

 just so we get im some time
thorpe grated

time seemed to drag the pirates
scattered over the sand played or
lolled in the sun under the awning
scarface amused himself by letting
handfuls of sand trickle through his
fingers while he talked to the girls
the prisoners however were stonily
silent

 phillip leighs muscles began to
cramp and twinge from holding one
position but he was afraid to move
for fear of discovery little sounds
from the men beside him told him
that they too were suffering he
envied the cimaroon his ability to
stand for what seemed hours motion-
less arms folded across his chest
then he heard the sounds he had

been waiting for-voices in the jun-
gle men crashing through the under-
brush from the green foliage a
score of men erupted it was the
water-party empty-handed

  captain captain descartes a
ship a ship over there

  the pirate crew flocked up form-
ing a knot around the excited men
a babble arose scarface stood under
the awning and shouted for quiet

  a ship he said merchantman
some of the brotherhood

  one of the water-party laughed
know who it is we went as far
as the beach and looked her over its
the swan

 there was dead silence then
scarfaces low ejaculation

 the swan phillip leigh by
god

  an theyre careened capn high
an dry theyve got a fort on the
beach but not a man in sight
scarface chuckled then he threw
back his head and roared

  the swan dye hear that boys
phillip leigh theres pickings for
you hes got the treasure of at least
three honest rogues in his hold and
hes careened over there

  the buccaneers responded with a
roar scarface held up his hand

  well surprise them he said
damn their fort get your muskets
look alive now

  leighs eyes glittered thats just
what i hoped for he whispered
now if brundage just lets them
come out on the beach

  the pirates filed into the jungle
leaving three of their number to
look after the girls miguel was
ordered to join the raiding party

  leigh waited until the three pi-
rates holding fast to their prisoners
turned at last from watching the
others vanish into the jungle

  all right he whispered we
cant shoot rush em

  but even as the three men mus-
kets in one hand and drawn blades
in the other drew themselves to a
pirates pay-day



crouch there was a flurry of action
on the beach involuntarily they
checked the taller girl had flashed
a hand to the bosom of her dress
a sliver of steel glittered in her fist
the pirate holding her let out a
startled oath which changed to a
yell as she struck blood spurted
from his shoulder he sprang away

  rush em phillip leigh cried
leading the dash across the sand

  the tall girl had whirled now to
the ruffian holding the other girl
but he had seen her coming he
flung his charge from him and caught
the darting knife hand the stiletto
fell to the sand a savage blow
knocked the tall girl sprawling

  then the wounded pirate looked
up to find phillip leigh and his men
almost upon him

  hey look out

  he snatched a pistol from his belt
and fired pointblank at leigh but
leigh had thrown himself to hands
and knees when he came up he ran
the man neatly through

  spinning around he saw a second
pirate go down beneath the combined
attack of thorpe and oniel the
third pirate cursing luridly was try-
ing to hold the smaller girl before
him as a shield she fought him off
then leighs blade licked out and
the pirate was down writhing

  phillip leigh glanced about him
looked down at the three dead pi-
rates the fire of battle still flooded
his veins his rapier quivered in his
grip but it was all over he turned
to the girls

  we are from the ship across the
island he said theyll have heard
that pistol shot theres no time to
lose here

  the girls were staring then as
a musket cracked aboard the ship
the taller girl stooped quickly and
retrieved her stiletto

the ship yes yes come maria
as more muskets cracked leigh
herded his charges across the sand
once in the jungle he turned sharply

to his left leading through the under-
brush until lack of breath forced a
halt he listened there was no
sound except their own breathing

 that damned cimaroon will track
us down thorpe panted

  were away for the time being at
least leigh said to the girls he
said i am phillip leigh master of
the swan

  in cardenas we hear of you the
taller girl answered her english was
heavily accented her voice low mu-
sical i am carlotta mendez daugh-
ter of don fernando my sister
maria

they pushed on part way across
the island the deep thunder of
cannon rumbled on their ears more
faintly they heard the popping of
muskets but in a short time the can-
nonading died only the reports of
muskets reaching them it was a slow
dropping fire however and leigh
knew that the pirates had been re-
pulsed

 the sun was halfway across the
western sky when phillip leigh and
his party at last stepped from the
shelter of low sand dunes and made
a dash for the fort yells arose in
the jungle muskets cracked but the
distance was much too great for dam-
age to be done

  brundage leighs first officer met
him as he scrambled over the wall into
the enclosure

  thank god youre back he said
gripping leighs hand

  leigh made him known to the girls
and then led them to a corner of the
fort the safest place he could find
where he told them to stay they re-
fused

 you have been wounded maria
said give us water and bandages

  leigh looked at the girls admira-
tion in his eyes their dresses were
ripped and torn perspiration dewed
their foreheads there was grime on
their faces and hands but through-
out all that had happened they had


thrilling adventures

made no outcry spoken no word of
complaint

  he saw that they had water and
bandages and then with brundage
moved to a gun emplacement

  how are we fixed to hold out he
asked at once

  brundages face was serious food
and water in plenty he said but
we used more powder than we thought
in that last sea-fight

  i thought as much what about
the men

  theyre taking it all right weve
been in tight spots before

eigh turned to the beach dead
pirates lay there but the man he
hated most was not among them
scarface was still free trapped here
on the beach only thirty of his crew
unwounded it began to look as if
scarface would be free long after
phillip leigh had ceased to bother
him

  late in the afternoon carlotta and
maria joined leigh and brundage at
a gun emplacement leigh learned
that the girls had been on their way
to an aunt in france when scarface
had taken their ship

  we are grateful to you carlotta
finished if only for a few more hours
before we must use my stiletto she
touched her dress

  it wont come to that senorita
leigh assured her we came out
here to put an end to scarface and
put an end to him we shall

  but how senor phillippe your
powder it is low your men so many
wounded she looked at the set of
his jaw at his eyes as he squinted at
the jungle ah when you look so i
think you will do it

  leighs face softened as he glanced
at her he turned to his mate

  brundage he said its only a
question of time until he sails his
ship around the island and bombards
the fort but i think hell wait until
his water casks are full before he does
that while hes waiting well take

a few men slip across the island and
steal his ship we can get off here
under cover of her guns

  brundage continued to stare at the
beach finally he nodded

  that he said is all that is left
the short twilight of the tropics
gave way abruptly to full night in
spite of the starlight the beach lay
a dim blanket between dark sea and
black forest leigh with thorpe and
thirteen others slipped over the wall
and stole quietly down to the water-
line

  a half-mile to the north leigh
found dunes behind which his men
could safely rise from their crouch
he led into the jungle an hour in
the pitch blackness where serrated
leaves scraped his skin and roots
clutched at his feet and he called a
halt in a little clearing

  it was here at the rear of the line
that leigh discovered the girls they
had dressed themselves in mans at-
tire of shirt and breeches rapiers
hung in baldrics they carried mus-
kets in their hands

  you he exclaimed what are
you doing here

  you need sound bodies carlotta
replied wounded men can fight in
a fort we fire muskets we fence and
we row

  it was impossible to send them
back cursing softly leigh plunged
into the blackness again

  at the edge of the jungle he looked
past the gaunt skeleton of the awning
to where waves lapped the sterns of
half a dozen boats beyond a black
silhouette lay the pirate ship

  boats drawn up and no guard he
said in a low voice they must think
they have us properly trapped well
our best bet is to pose as part of the
crew returning you thorpe take
seven men and go up the anchor
chains at the bow ill lead the rest
over the waist he turned to the
girls stay out of sight behind the
men

  the men loosened cutlasses saw to
pirates pay-day



the priming of muskets and then
boldly followed leigh out of the jun-
gle they had traversed two-thirds of
the distance to the boats when a shout
broke the silence the boats seemed
to boil spewing dark forms

  stunned leigh halted his scalp
crawled there was a gone feeling in
the pit of his stomach

  fire he yelled fire

  his voice broke the paralysis that
had gripped his men a ragged vol-
ley cracked some of the pirates fell
bursts of orange flame answered and
then the two forces locked in a shout-
ing stamping mob

  phillip leigh knew at once that his
little band was hopelessly outnum-
bered but he had no time to think of
that steel grated on his rapier mus-
kets clubbed at him out of the corner
of his eye he saw carlotta and maria
back to back then something struck
him from behind he was on hands
and knees the last he remembered
seeing was a booted foot spurning the
sand   

hen phillip leigh came back
to consciousness he felt the
hard planking of a deck under him
water dripped and ran from his face
and hair his head ached struggling
he managed to sit up only to catch a
second bucket of bitter seawater full
in the face laughter arose

  the moon had risen and he saw
that he was on the pirate ship about
him sitting or lying on the deck was
what was left of his little band to
one side held firmly stood carlotta
and maria

  then he looked up to see scarface
leering down at him the moonlight
revealing clearly the scar from which
he took his name

  well said the pirate i am not
flattered by your opinion of me
thought you could take my ship be-
hind my back did you he chuckled
no i am not flattered but i am
grateful for the return of the two
little pigeons to their coop

  then as leigh remained silent
scarface lifted one booted foot
planted it firmly in the prisoners face
and shoved leighs head struck the
deck and agony shot through him he
lay still

  drag that scum to the forecastle
scarface roared tie em up to the
bunks and tie these wenches in my
cabin

  leigh was yanked to his feet he
felt sick nauseated a leaden weight
rode his shoulders bent his head he
had failed

  but not yet his arms had not been
bound the rough grip of his handlers
was none too firm and then the man
on leighs right shifted his hold
with a sudden wrench of his body
he tore his right arm free a slashing
blow to the neck felled the second
pirate like a flash leigh sprang
over the bulwark in a curving dive

  the water glittered for an instant
beneath him and then he struck ad
was under swimming with all his
strength when his lungs would stand
no more he rose gasping for air to
continue

  there was a shout of discovery
muskets banged and pistols spat the
balls chirked into the water around
him he heard scarface bellow for a
boat then he was under again

  to reach the shore with a boat
pursuing he knew would be impos-
sible strangely enough now that he
was free the pirate ship offered his
only refuge deliberately he rose to
the surface

 the moonlight revealed him at
once more muskets cracked dimly
he heard men scrambling into a boat
suddenly as if he had been hit he
threw up his hands and sank

  immediately he struck out under
water this time directly for the ship
and when he rose the dark hull loomed
close above him a few noiseless
strokes and he reached up one hand
found enough purchase with his nails
on the rough wood to hold him and
there he clung


thrilling adventures

 a boat pulled away from the ship
and was rowed back and forth in the
water but leigh could see that the
search was half-hearted

  must ha got im a voice called

  all right the barracuda will fin-
ish him we havent all night

 that was scarface the boat drew
in to the ship and leigh clung silently
under the bulging hull he heard
scarface telling off a score of men to
work the ship and man the guns
then men scrambled down clattering
into the waiting boats leigh let him-
self sink while the rest of the crew
got away for the shore

  quietly then he swam toward the
ships stern he sought for a rope a
forgotten jacobs-ladder anything
that might let him regain the deck
unseen there was nothing

 anchor chains clanked blocks
creaked and rattled there were
shouted orders and the sound of run-
ning feet the ship heeled slightly
in the water began to move

  leigh swam faster with increasing
panic he was almost run down by
the slowly swinging hull and still
no means of gaining the deck offered
itself he reached the stern and then
as the vessel swung he caught at the
rudder-post and scrambled to a pre-
carious position beside it where the
overhang of the stern cabins hid him
from sight

at daylight soaking wet
cramped his body numb phillip
leigh stared with bloodshot eyes at
the shore gliding slowly astern they
had rounded the island in the night
and were beating up toward the fort

  it was voices drifting down from
the cabins above that finally drove
the fog from his brain carlotta and
maria he looked up but the over-
hanging stern blocked his vision

 almost immediately there were
sounds of activity on deck the an-
chors let go with a rattle and roar
the ship lost weigh voices clamored
on the beach they were at the fort

  leigh heard scarface bellow a com-
mand and the guns of the ship thun-
dered every move was agony but
somehow clutching the rudderpost
he managed to stand upright

 thunder on the beach now the
ship quivered as she was hulled an
answering roar from the decks above
and the bombardment was on a sin-
gle gun spoke above leigh then his
fingers caught at the sill of a cabin
window he dangled in mid-air

  blood roared in his ears fire shot
along his arms he kicked and strug-
gled seeking for a toe-hold his foot
caught held and with a heave and
shrug he tumbled into the cabin
phillip capn phillip

  it was thorpes voice dim in his
ears lights still flickered before his
eyes he lay still panting waiting
until he could see through the dim-
ness then he made out the form of
his second bound tightly to the leg
of a massive table there was blood
on thorpes wrists from his struggles
with the ropes but his haggard face
shone with an incredulous joy

 damme thorpe cried where
have you been

 hanging on the rudder-post
leigh answered he hauled himself
to his feet and limped to the wall on
which hung a naked rapier wait till
i get you loose

  the edge of the rapier sawed at
thorpes bonds and in a moment they
fell to the floor thorpe scrambled to
his feet and seized leigh

  i knew you were up to somethin
when you went over-side

  leigh shook his head were to-
gether again thats all i know
his voice was thick with fatigue
he turned to the table and rummaged
through the drawers finally drawing
out a case in which lay two pistols

  thought thered be something like
this around take them

  he held the pistols out to thorpe
who looked to their loading and prim-
ing and then thrust the weapons into
his belt
pirates pay-day



 cutlass is more my speed he
growled

  where are the girls leigh asked
  in the next cabin to this one
  all right lets go

  leigh led the way through the stern
window again clutching the carved
woodwork they made a precarious
way to the adjoining windows and a
moment later stepped into a dim
cabin

  capitaine phillippe leigh senor
thorpe

  the girls amazed voices were al-

dling of an after gun leigh counted
four dead pirates

  but even as he counted a ball from
the fort plowed into the bulwarks
just under the muzzle of one of the
guns the heavy piece whirled back-
ward crushing one of the pirates and
flying splinters cut down two more
that reduced the odds brundage
was making good use of what powder
he had left leigh closed the door

  how many of our men were left
he asked

  eight i think not counting our-

 in the next issue

most drowned in the thunder of the
guns leigh saw that both girls were
bound as thorpe had been to the legs
of a table it was the work of a mo-
ment to cut them free

  with a glad cry thorpe sprang to
a stand and picked up a long cutlass
the girls half sobbing in spanish
caught at their rescuers clung to
them leigh pushed carlotta aside

  youll be all right now he said

  all the time we knew you would
come carlotta told him

  whats the orders capn thorpe
asked he brandished the cutlass

 leigh crossed to the door and
opened it a crack smoke billowed
across the deck where the pirates
yelled and toiled at their guns over-
head feet stamped where scarface
personally superintended the han-

selves theyre tied in the forecastle
we could slip up there without being
seen and free them

  leigh shook his head

  scarface is on the poop and the
breeze is keeping the smoke cleared
hed spot us before we got halfway
for a moment he looked into thorpes
eyes theres a surer way but-
he left the statement unfinished and
stared at his second mate

 thorpes eyes narrowed his jaw
set

  lets have it

  all right theres a swivel-gun on
the poop and the chances are ten to
one that its crammed with bullets
you and i can gain the poop and
knock off scarfaces gun crew then
you turn the swivel-gun on the pi-
rates in the waist theyre all at the
thrilling adventures

starboard batteries wait until you
have a knot of them and take half a
dozen wheo you fire ill take care
of scarface as soon as you fire step
to the head of the companion and hold
it

  he turned to the girls when you
hear the swivel-gun go off you two
run forward keeping on the port side
and behind the deck-houses cut
the men free and tell them to arm
themselves with anything they can
find cutlasses belaying-pins-any-
thing

  he looked back at thorpe he knew
what was passing through his seconds
mind there were two ladders to the
poop what was to prevent the pirates
in the waist from swarming up one
while thorpe held the other their
act would provide a better chance to
free the crew but it meant death for
leigh and thorpe beyond any doubt

  theres more here than you and
me leigh said the senoritas the
crew once the ship is taken brun-
dage can take care of the rest

  ill need a match thorpe an-
swered simply

  use a pistol

capitaine capitaine phillippe
carlotta caught at his arm you are
so grim dont-dont get hurt
phillip leigh patted her shoulder
you know what you are to do
you have your knife yet

  carlotta reached into the bosom of
her shirt and drew out the blade

  leigh nodded then you just do
your part and well be all right

  as he led through the door he
heard carlotta calling

  phillippe dont hurt miguel 

thunder on the deck the sting
of burned powder in his nostrils
phillip leigh did not feel the quiver-
ing planks beneath his feet he
seemed disembodied floating he
caught a glimpse of the toiling gun
crews saw miguels shoulders heave
and gleam then he was at the ladder

to the poop his rapier flashed as he
laid hold of the railing strangely as
he mounted he thought of a scaffold

  his eyes came level with the poop-
deck above it scarface with two
gunners moved about a smoking can-
non then scarface turned

  at sight of phillip leigh the pi-
rates jaw sagged with a wild oath
he jerked a pistol from his belt and
fired the ball whistling past leighs
head

  a pistol cracked and one of the
gunners clutched at his breast and
fell the other startled into action
whipped out his cutlass and rushed to
the attack with scarface following
him

  sight of the man he was seeking
brought leigh completely to his
senses again a hot flood welled up
inside him he felt his tired muscles
quiver with sudden desire

  a cutlass gleamed he parried the
blow returned a short thrust that
pierced the pirates throat then scar-
face was upon him

  leigh sprang to one side came on
guard the rapiers grated and whined
dimly he heard thorpes yell and
then the swivel-gun boomed there
was screaming in the waist but leigh
could not spare an instant from scar-
face

  around and around the two men
stamped leigh fencing as he never
had before scarface fighting desper-
ately for a quick victory it was the
mans very desperation that kept him
from his end for leigh discovered
that his tired arms were not equal to
the task before him he was on the
defensive sweat stung his forehead
as he tried to keep his elbow close to
his flank his blade circling

  voices yelled in the waist over
scarfaces shoulder leigh caught a
glimpse of thorpe at the head of the
ladder his cutlass flashing he
writhed away from a quick thrust

  suddenly he disengaged and sprang
back in amazement there at the port
pirates pay-day



ladder huge shoulders glistening a
chocolate-colored giant swung a heavy
cutlass miguel was holding the port
companion

  scarfaces blade leaped in leigh
twisted and steel grated on his ribs
he felt sick the blade stabbed again
cut his thigh he staggered back for
a moment he managed to hold the pi-
rate off then he felt his blade
twisted whipped to the right and then
to the left it was coming he saw
it in scarfaces leering countenance
in the poise of his body the pirate
straightened

  leigh half parried steel pierced
his shoulder he was down with the
pirate poised for a death thrust

  scarface

  still poised the pirate checked and
leigh rolled free

  there swaying on his feet running
blood from a dozen wounds stood
thorpe a pistol in his right hand
dirt and blood distorted his face but
through it his teeth gleamed in a
white grin

  through the belly thorpe said
the pistol cracked

  scarface screamed and dropped his
rapier he clutched his middle in
agony grimly thorpe watched as the
pirate bent lower and lower finally
crashing to the deck then very
quietly he too sagged and fell

  even as he lay on the deck the ship
seemed to be wheeling about phillip
leigh he tried to get up but his

arms collapsed dimly he heard cheer-
ing but whether from buccaneers or
seamen he could not tell he thought
he saw carlottas head at the top of
the ladder to the poop and then a
gray cloud enveloped him

 when he regained consciousness
he was lying on a couch in one of the
cabins carlotta sat beside him her
cool hand on his forehead

  phillippe she whispered phil-
lippe

 at the low sound brundage moved
into leighs vision

  thorpe phillip asked

 with miguel in the next cabin
carlotta told him maria is with
them miguel was no pirate phil-
lippe he pretend so he can be with
us

  phillip looked up at brundage in-
quiringly

 we got off brundage told him
with every living soul ive laid a
course for barbados

  the pirates

  still on the island we used our
last cupful of powder on them brun-
dages face turned sober the swan
is gone phillip i turned our guns
on her and blew out her stern so they
couldnt use her

  phillip leighs eyes closed for an
instant and when he opened them
only carlotta was there a faint smile
touched his lips he raised his good
hand to hers and then let his eyes
shut once more

the one-masted seventy-ton

roadstead of the zuider-zee
outside the spanish-controlled dutch
city of amsterdam with a rattle and
a splash her anchor went over cleaved
the dark water and bit into the silt
that would hold her at rest for the
night

   the moon was not yet risen and in
 the darkness the chantey of her sail-
 ors rose softly as her sails came down
 softly because sailors-even english
 sailors-hesitated to sing out loud and
 bold when close to a land enslaved
 and bloodied by an alien tyrants rule

  the month was december the year

upon the people of the maritime
provinces




thrilling adventures

  the nancys captain and her first
mate stood at the brigs taffrail and
stared out across the zuider-zee to-
ward the scattered lights in the houses
of the city such light made by
whale oil in lamps the people of hol-
land still had but the light of free-
dom had gone from their hearts it
was of this that the first mate tim-
othy waynesmith was thinking while
captain miller thought merely of how
long it would take him to clear his
cargo take on another and set sail
for england and home

timothy waynesmiths

chest heaved as he took in air and
then expelled it in a kind of sigh

  lad the stocky captain said
glancing sideward and upward at his
chief officer ye breathe as though ye
would take in all the air there is and
leave not a whiff for others

  no captain waynesmith said
quietly i breathe so deep because
this is not english air but dutch and
a man must take on ten times the
quantity of it to get a free english-
mans lungful

  aye lad these are cruel times for
the dutch under spanish rule but tis
no business of ours

 isnt it captain timothy
waynesmiths blue eyes flashed

  why no tis no skin off a brit-
ishers back

  tis skin off every britishers back
when the whips of the inquisition
scourge the skin from the backs of
dutch men women and children
waynesmith flashed

  hush lad dont talk so loud
voices carry far across the water
let them carry to king philip in
spain then ill not hold my tongue
aboard an english ship no skin off
a britishers back tis skin off my
back i dont feel free when a people
we think good enough to trade with
are in bondage to an alien king
tim trades one thing fighting
another peoples battles is another
its our battle too waynesmith

had lowered his voice but it was not
less intense for that reason his
strong hands gripped the rail and his
powerful muscles rippled beneath his
shirt cant folk understand that
philips conquest of holland would
make the spanish empire the most
powerful on earth and that then
philip would be in a position to go on
and conquer us-england what
would become of our liberties as eng-
glishmen then no the dutch people
arent fighting for themselves alone
theyre fighting for us too for our
liberties and englishmen would see
that blast them if they could see any
farther than their fog-bound noses

  this is no ordinary war captain
this is a life and death struggle and
we englishmen ought to be in it or
at least help the dutch with volun-
teers money and weapons the dutch
are fighting for their religion for
their homes their wives and families
the spanish armies of king philip
give no quarter and show no mercy
it makes no difference whether a town
surrenders or is taken the spaniards
put its people to the sword-men
women and children alike

  king philip and his inquisition
are determined to crush out the life of
these provinces to stamp out the re-
ligion of the country and to leave not
a single man woman or child alive
who refuses to bow the knee before
them well the dutch are equally
determined to give their lives to the
cause of religious liberty could there
be a better cause isnt every human
being entitled to worship in his own
way according to the dictates of his
own conscience is it right to hate
and persecute those whose race and
religion are different from ours tell
me that captain miller

  the captain was long in answering
he took a clay pipe out of his pocket
loaded it with tobacco-that strange
weed which sir walter raleigh had
but recently brought over to england
from the indians in the american
wilderness-and applying struck flint
fight for freedom



to tinder lighted it when it was
drawing well he withdrew it from his
mouth and said

 lad tis a long speech ye have
made and a powerful one the ques-
tions ye ask i have no ready answer
to yet if i mistake not ye have been
leading up to something underneath
all your questions i seem to hear an-
other unspoken ye seek leave to go
ashore do ye not

  the tall young seaman was startled
and his bronzed face flushed beneath
its weatherbeat

  youre a sharp man captain he
said i do

  and dont ye know lad that alva
the spanish governor has issued an
edict forbidding shore leaves to the
crews of foreign vessels the reason
bein as ye well know that english
sailors who feel as you do have been
joinin the armies of the prince of
orange to fight against spanish
rule-

 and for dutch freedom and re-
ligious tolerance the first mate fin-
ished for him yes i know that but
im not crew sir im a ships officer
the edict doesnt apply to me

  no it doesnt the captain granted
spanish law aint your law but cap-
tains law is will ye admit that

  i will

 and if i ordered ye to remain
aboard ye would remain would ye
not

  you havent so ordered yet sir i
couldnt rightly know the answer to
that question until you did

  the captains mouth opened to issue
a command then closed the command
still unspoken he looked at his first
mate undecidedly

 tim lad he asked in a quiet
voice were ye minded to volunteer
i cant right say sir tim wayne-
smith replied in a voice equally low
my intention in going ashore was to
look up a dutchman mynheer van
pieter by name who was a good
friend of my late father and to give
him a watch which my father wished

him to have as to whether i had
other and deeper intentions perhaps
i did and perhaps i didnt i cant
say

captain millers anxiety did
not diminish at this response

  mister waynesmith he said sob-
erly i seek not to abuse a cap-
tains authority i would hesitate to
say to any officer of mine whose feet
hungered for the touch of mother
earth no ye may not go ashore
but ye worry me sore lad-mister
waynesmith ye have a quick lip and
a hot temper whats on your lung is
on your tongue to make matters
worse yeve a youthful heart on fire
with a peoples wrongs added to
which yeve notions of your own as
to what englishmen should do about
it

  in short lad-mister waynesmith
-if i let ye go ashore id take no
mans wager that ye would not get
into trouble with the spanish per-
haps get into jail and mayhap even
end with your neck in the gallows
rope and lad ye are but a humble
seaman like myself your trouble
would scarcely cause a ripple in the
court of our good queen elizabeth
but-the captains voice quickened-
i wont say no to ye i wont say yes
and i wont say no ye may do as
your own conscience dictates

  their hands met thanks cap-
tain waynesmith said in a low voice
thats what the dutch people are
fighting for-so that all men may do
work worship as their consciences
dictate

  the bosun will row you ashore
captain miller said quietly

  five minutes later the stocky cap-
tain leaning on the rail gazed across
the waters at the dark patch receding
shoreward the plashing of the oars
came to his ears

  there goes the best mate i ever
had he muttered

  he tapped out the ashes of his pipe
and the burnt tobacco of america fell

into the dark smooth waters of the

  fare ye well mister waynesmith
the captain of the nancy murmured

chapter ii

what peace

like most sailors
timothy waynesmith
was accustomed to
making his first stop
when ashore at the
handiest tavern there
washing the seasalt
from his throat with a
beaker of beer or three
fingers of stronger waters tonight
he sought something in addition-in-
formation-the which could not be
more certainly obtained than at a
sailors inn

  accordingly his long legs with
their rolling gait carried him up the
quay and to the door of a tavern whose
lamp-lighted sign swinging in the
night breeze identified it somewhat
ominously as the whales mouth
like jonah of old tim entered

  it was the bar that gave the tavern
its name shaped to resemble the jaws
of the sea leviathan with the ivory-
white teeth of a right whale jutting
from an overhanging beam the
drinker at such a bar might well fancy
that hehad come face to face with the
spouting monster himself

  to waynesmith however who had
been on a three years whaling voyage
when only sixteen this replica of a
whales jaws was tame indeed thrust-
ing head and shoulders into the
mouth he rapped with his stout
gnarled stick upon the bar-a stick
he always carried when ashore a
more effective weapon than it looked
because it was lead-weighted in its
knobbed head

  the barkeep seemed to appear from
within the innards of the whale
through a little black door out of
which he had to come crouchingly be-
fore rising to his full height a sober

dutch face looked into waynesmitha
own

  what would ye english sailor
who rap with such impatience upon
my whales lower jaw cannot a man
have peaceful sup with his family
waynesmith leaned further for-
ward can any dutchman have peace-
ful sup with his family these days
he asked quietly

  fear leaped into the eyes of the
tavern keeper he looked past wayne-
smith at the others in the room the
fact that the english sailor had re-
plied in dutch was no matter of
surprise to him many of them had
command of the language what
frightened him was this englishmans
implied criticism of king philips
rule it had become an offense in
holland even to listen to such talk
much less make it waynesmith how-
ever had sufficiently remembered
captain millers warning to keep his
voice low

  what would ye sailor a look
of friendliness but also of warning
passed from the dutchman to timo-
thy waynesmith

  i seek the road to the village of
vordwyck where resides one myn-
heer van pieter i have come ashore
to pay him a visit he having been
friend to my father

  at mention of the name the inn-
keepers face lost even more of its
ruddy color he swallowed hard his
adams apple jumping then in a
voice still lower than before he said
the road to vordwyck is but two
miles you would have to travel much
farther than that to find mynheer
van pieter

  why has he moved then

  the dutchmans replying voice was
now a whisper he has been moved
-moved into a shallow grave after
being hanged by the minions of the
blood council the road to heaven
is long englishman if you wish to
live until your hair now russet turns
gray you will not see mynheer van
pieter very soon
fight for freedom



  timothy waynesmiths lips were
tight-compressed but his eyes were
hot

 how-how did this come about
what crime did he commit

  have i not said that you would
have to seek him in heaven the
crime englishman of being dutch
which was the crime too of his wife
and daughter

  they-they too

  the dutchman nodded spoke a sin-
gle word but soundlessly wayne-
smith saw only his lips move

  dead  

a voice suddenly cut in behind
them

 speak up dutchman you know
that whispered conversations are not
allowed

 timothy waynesmith might have
had a hot temper but he could also
upon occasion exercise an iron control
over his nerves accordingly he did
not immediately whirl upon the
speaker who had spoken dutch with
a thick german accent he was able
therefore to see the color drain com-
pletely out of the tavern keepers face
the tavern keepers lips moved but
again no sound came it was as though
fear had paralyzed his vocal chords
but the tall seaman reading the lips
knew that the dutchmans involuntary
response had been

  now    see what you have done
for answer timothy waynesmith
dropped one eyelid in a slow reas-
suring wink

  but the other eye glowed with hot
lights slowly the nancys first mate
turned

  he immediately picked out his man
-a man still seated at a table a little
off to one side dressed in the uniform
of a spanish officer with a long sword
dangling on the floor from a loosened
belt the mans ruff slightly open at
the throat revealed a portion of the
cuirass of chain-mail encasing his
chest

  the man was not spanish he was

german-waynesmith could tell at a
glance and he made a shrewd guess
at the officers identity-carl von aert
in command of the german mercen-
aries fighting under king philips
colors honorary member of king
philips blood council as well

  hired butcher of women and chil-
dren the seaman thought no whis-
pered conversations eh soon youll
be telling the dutch not to talk at all
and then to stop breathing well
they might rather than breathe the
foul air of bondage all amsterdam
may be under your thumb butcher
but i know at least one man who will
shout when you command him to
whisper

  sir he said aloud fixing wide
unblinking eyes upon the officer my
conversation with this gentleman is
private i am familiar with many
strange laws of many strange lands
but i have yet to come across a law as
strange as the one which seeks to
regulate the loudness and softness
with which people may converse to-
gether so-

 timothy waynesmiths chest
heaved the hot temper against which
captain miller had warned him
seemed to gather with tidal force in
his breast all at once

  so- he said be good enough to
keep your butchers nose out of my
business he ended with a thunder-
ous shout his heavy stick coming
down upon the floor with a punctu-
ating crash

  for several seconds there was dead
silence in the room a silence accom-
panied by aghas looks open mouths
dry lips gullets jumping as men swal-
lowed hard the dutch patrons of the
tavern-lighter-men sailors rousta-
bouts-hardly dared look at one an-
other scarcely believed they had
heard aright the terrible von aert
defied to his teeth good round dutch
words laid on like the slaps of a heavy
hand across his cruel mouth

  and the uniformed mercenaries-
some from germany across the rhine


thrilling adventures

others from italy beyond the alps-
were not less aghast yet they did
not move waiting for von aert to give
the command the presence of these
foreign soldiers in the armies of king
philip was proof that this was not a
war of one people against another
people not a war of the spanish
people against the dutch people but
a conscienceless war of a tyrant king
a bloody governor a cruel counsellor
and a brutal body of inquisitors
against a country struggling for inde-
pendence and religious freedom

  in the momentary silence when
everybody in the room seemed frozen
into positions like so many statues
there was time for thoughts to course
swiftly through timothy wayne-
smiths heated brain

  ive done it now his mind flashed
yon butcher there has but to draw
one of his pistols and put a bullet in
my roiling guts to bring his insulted
nose back into joint again even so
the thing will not be entirely without
profit dutchmen have heard a free
man speak the lesson will not be
wasted on them some effect it will
have-the story will spread aye tis
not a total loss if it makes dutchmen
resist their oppressors

  curse me though im forever let-
ting my heart run away with my head
the thing to do is not to die for free-
dom but to live and fight for it
and how are you going to do that
timothy my boy with that butchers
bullet in you but hist not so fast
youre not dead yet yon butcher
there if he draws his pistol-ill do
my best to give him back a split skull
for his murder-meant bullet

  his swift hot thoughts during
which his eyes were none the less on
the alert were interrupted by the cold
dry voice of von aert there was a
murderous light in the blood coun-
sellors small green eyes one corner
of his mouth twitched outward sign
of the hate that rocked inside of him
and suddenly even before those thin
cruel lips issued their command tim

waynesmith saw why he had not been
shot down at once von aert held
such a death to be too merciful

accordingly waynesmith was
not surprised when von aert
said quietly

  arrest him

  instantly before the soldiers had
time to move waynesmith rapped
out

  not so fast mister whoever-you-
are if im guilty of an offense
against hollands laws ill submit to
arrest and trial be good enough to
inform me then upon what grounds
you are ordering the arrest of an eng-
lish citizen

  you are not in england now said
von aert wetting his thin lips as
though in anticipation of sights and
sounds to be seen and heard later in
some subterranean torture chamber
nor do i see any need of accounting
for my actions to a common sailor
who is ashore in defiance of an ordi-
nance forbidding foreign seaman to
set foot on dutch land

  and you snapped waynesmith
with a swift glance at the dutchmen
in the room as though asking them to
pay particular attention to his next
words are you dutch or a foreigner
if the latter what are you doing on
dutch soil

  the question so logically phrased
seemed to bring all the germans gall
and bile to his face nevertheless he
kept control of himself still antici-
pating as waynesmith well knew his
revenge to come

  von aert tapped his sword i am
here by virtue of this he bit out
through twitching lips

  truth forced from the lips of
wickedness the tall seaman shot out
like a flash the sword and nothing
but the sword the dutch people do
not want you

  to himself timothy waynesmith
thought grimly might as well be
hung for a sheep as for a lamb noth-
ing that i could say could make the
fight for freedom



butchers intentions toward me any
worse

  the thought took but the fraction
of an instant and did not noticeably
halt his speech

  i am here as an officer of a ship
which runs in the anglo-dutch trade
he said the difference between you
and me is that the dutch people want
me and hate you want our mutual
commerce and hate your blood-drink-
ing sword and i remind you that as
a ships officer your blackguardly
ordinances dont apply to me

  von aert was a patient man he
could wait

  very well he said almost lazily
you will be arrested for disturbing
the peace unsettling the minds of the
people and making seditious utter-
ances

  peace said waynesmith softly
what peace

  arrest him von aert said again
he is growing tiresome

  peace timothy waynesmith re-
peated drawing back a step what
peace

  and with the words he struck

chapter iii

the call of alkmaar

it was as though
a whirlwind had
roared suddenly in
the whales mouth

  up to the very
last second von
aerts mercenaries
accustomed to the
peaceful submission
of amsterdam citizens had expected
this englishman to yield at the most
they had looked for merely defensive
resistance from him certainly they
had not expected him to take the
offensive and that one seconds lee-
way gave tim waynesmith the ad-
vantages of surprise momentum and
attack that can be so decisive in
determining the outcome of at least
the initial stage of a battle

 he was far outnumbered there
were six of von aerts hirelings von
aert himself made seven wayne-
smith had no weapon save his oaken
stick - they had pistols halberds
dirks one had a cross-bow von aert
had his sword but he was faster than
they not weighted down with a steel
breast-plate and he had one added
advantage that was mighty though in-
tangible they were hireling fighters
but he was a fighting freeman

  he took that one backward step-
the step that had deceived them into
thinking him defensive but which was
really intended to give his body clear-
ance and spring-and with a shout of
exultation sprang forward

  the stick whirled about his head
the two soldiers who had been de-
tailed to the immediate business of
arresting him jerked the pistols out
of their belts the stick made savage
sound cutting the air as lightning
cuts the sky to make thunder follow
tim waynesmith brought it down
not upon the steel headpiece that
would have repelled the blow but
against the muscular neck its lead-
weighted knob crashingly hooking be-
neath the ear and jaw

 the soldier tumbled down into
paralysis and death the single blow
having smashed and torn apart the
bodys great third nerve but the
stick did not stop moving it swooped
and smoked with an underhand mo-
tion along the floor oak met bone
as waynesmith sent the head of his
weapon crashing against the second
soldiers ankle

  encountering the bone and break-
ing it nevertheless the stick in-
credibly kept moving completing its
savage upward arc-testimony of the
tremendous strength with which the
blow had been delivered for the sol-
diers broken foot went up in an
involuntary half-kick the next in-
stant he crashed on his back to the
floor

 stand away from harm dutch-
men waynesmith roared out of his


thrilling adventures

heaving chest this brawl is my guilt
   not yours

  the warning was not needed the
patrons had already sought refuge be-
hind tables and chairs but strangely
enough not one of them had sought
the accessible safety that lay outside
the taverns door dutch eyes watched
missed nothing dutch hearts burned

  there was a flash of flame the
second soldier still on his back had
discharged his pistol the ball tore
through waynesmiths sheepskin-
lined short jacket of scottish wool
beneath his arm socket a moving
target his heart had flashed out of
line between the aim and the trigger-
pull

  simultaneously a voice sounded
high-pitched in desperation

  take him alive fools i want him
alive

  it was von aert in a panic lest his
slower but more terrible vengeance be
taken from him von aert had stood
up at last behind his table his belt
was hooked now his sword was out
gleaming nakedly in the light from
the oil lamps he watched as though
he were a commander on a hilltop
overlooking the operations of his
army battling in the valley below but
his eyes were not cool as a generals
might be they were hot with hate

 waynesmith heard von aerts
words even in the midst of thrusting
the stick stiff-armed into the belly
of a soldier plunging at him with hal-
berd extended

  youll never take me alive or dead
butcher he shouted and the dutch-
men hearing him marveled to detect
in the words a kind of tremendous
laughter

  the knob of the stick unerringly
found the yielding flesh below the
breast-plate the breath went out of
the halberdier as his eyeballs shot up
in agony and his face went white he
doubled up forward his spear
weapon dropped from his hands be-
hind the stricken soldier waynesmith
saw an upraised battle-axe

  he let fall his precious stick what
he had to do now could not be accom-
plished with it he jerked his man
backward with him his powerful
hands tightening on the mans waist
he lifted the inert body some two feet
off the floor then with a tremendous
heave sent it crashing into the man
with the mace

  there was the sound of a skull
splitting the horrible spurt and spat-
ter of blood human head had met
axe head and one soldier had unwit-
tingly slain the other

  kill him kill him von aert was
now crying

  forgotten was his hot dream of tor-
ture this englishman was a samson
who would kill them all in the attempt
to take him alive

 through timothy waynesmiths
throbbing brain flashed the knowledge
that the advantage given him by von
aerts original desire was no longer
his three soldiers still remained in
combat and now they could use their
pistols two were slow to react to
von aerts altered order one was not

  waynesmith swooped recovered his
stick but a stick was no weapon
against pistols that could be fired
from a distance though that distance
be measured only in feet the bullet
in that leveled pistol was likely to
find home in an english seamans head
or heart

but something happened the shot
was never fired the foot-soldier
tripped and went sprawling wayne-
smith did not see what had caused him
to do so-did not see a dutchman from
his hiding place thrust out his cudgel
between the soldiers legs and trip
him

 but von aert had seen with a
curse he came around from his table
shelter still ten feet away from timo-
thy waynesmith with svift strides
the german crossed the room passing
behind the two remaining soldiers he
leaned over a table his sword struck
down it emerged dripping and the
fight for freedom



british seaman knew then what had
saved him the dutchmans cudgel
rolled out from under the table mute
testimony of what had happened

  but there had been no time to pre-
vent von aerts murder of wayne-
smiths saviour the broken-ankled
halberdier had drawn his second pis-
tol the tall seaman lunged brought
his stick around the pistol went
flying kept company by the bone-
splinters of a shattered wrist

 from waynesmiths overcharged
chest words roared out as he scooped
up the dead dutchmans cudgel and
flung it into the face of the cross-
bowman

  curse you he shouted do you
think i want to break mens bones
why dont you go back to your homes
where you belong and fight your
oppressors there instead of helping
your own oppressors to slaughter an
innocent people who want nothing but
independence and the right to wor-
ship god in their own way curse
you von aert why dont you use
your sword against my stick id not
stop at breaking your bones all of
them

inflamed the german started
forward waynesmith advanced to
meet him suddenly he stopped

  von aert stopped too there was
the sound of the tramp of feet with-
out the light of hope leaped into
von aerts face waynesmith read
the meaning of that look aright fresh
soldiers attracted by the sound of the
fight were coming and von aert saw
the possibilities of his originally
planned vengeance returning the
englishman knew that the time for
retreat had come he could not fight
an army

  out of the tail of his eye he saw
that the little black half-door out of
which the tavern keeper had first
emerged was partly open he re-
called that the tavern keeper had
closed it behind him so he concluded
correctly that the tavern keeper must

have opened it for his benefit-opened
it furtively with his boot heel per-
haps

  a troop of halberdiers appeared in
the doorway

  waynesmith whirled shouting

  im in this war from now on von
aert and he hurled himself into
the jaws of the whale

 over the bar he vaulted once
there crouched he paused for a single
breathless instant to perform a
strange act of kindness

  for your own good and safety inn-
keeper he whispered pantingly and
with the words gave the dutchman a
sharp rap with his stick upon his pate
-a stunning blow but not a fracturing
one now von aert wont hang you
hell be thinking you tried to stop
me

  the next instant he was through the
little door running low across the
floor of a lighted kitchen a woman
and two children crouched fearsomely
in a corner-the inn-keepers family

  bless ye the sudden visitation
whispered to them ill have supper
with ye another time

  he was out the side door and in an
alley a second later he broke into
a run he had to get oat of the city
fast get into open country for all
amsterdam would be on the watch for
him it didnt occur to him to make
a dash for the water get back to his
ship he was in the war now and he
knew that captain miller would not
be surprised if he did not return the
captain had prophesied truly-timo-
thy waynesmith had volunteered

  he broke from the alley and ran
full-tilt into an armored figure hel-
meted with the visor pulled down
the figure recoiled swung a battle-
axe the impact had caused wayne-
smith to drop his stick that was
fortunate he caught the half of the
axe with both his hands as it swooped
letting his hands come down in the
blows continuing arc to avoid break-
ing his finger bones the flat of the
axe hit the ground rebounded with


thrilling adventures

spent force and he wrested it from
the hands of the armored man

  no sound came from waynesmiths
lips if the other gave tongue with
curses the visored helmet muffled
them the silent and terrible drama
lasted but a second the axe went up
came down in a swift arc of doom
it bit through neck-guard gorget-
split the links of the chain-mail
cuirass and stopped with its sharply
tempered toledo steel imprisoned be-
tween severed ribs waynesmith let
man and axe fall together retrieved
his stick and sped on

  the next two hours were nightmar-
ish it took him that length of time
to get out of the city although with-
out pursuit and the necessity of hid-
ing he could have accomplished it in
half the time

  he did not know that the armored
man he had killed was francesco
llanos von aerts most important
spy who knew many languages and
had many disguises and who had
donned this last disguise in order to
obtain information about the dissatis-
faction among the mercenaries over
arrears in pay

  llanoss last disguise had not pro-
tected him against his own battle-axe
in the hands of an english seaman
thus merely incidentally while on
the run tim waynesmith had struck
a further blow for freedom

  but even that knowledge would
have been powerless to allay his
fatigue or satisfy his hunger his
aching muscles cried out for rest his
powerful body needed food to replace
the energy he had burned up

  he was like a tired stag hunted by
hounds he had hidden in alleys in
rain barrels-not empty barrels but
ones full of water for his pursuers
would have looked into the empty
ones so he had held his breath until
the danger had passed and emerged
dripping and shivering in the night
air to get warm again in flight the
clothes drying on his back while
growing wet with sweat beneath

  now he ran low across a flat field
which had yielded wheat in summer
the dark shapes of two structures
loomed-a windmill and a farmhouse
waynesmith hesitated he had to
have food but could he chance con-
tact with other human beings yet

it was six of one and a half dozen of
the other he went pantingly up to
the door raised his stick to knock-
the door opened a low dutch
voice said come in-quickly

marveling waynesmith
obeyed the entrance hall was
in darkness he felt a friendly hand
on his arm it guided him to a room
in which a single candle burned in
the room were a woman and a boy of
sixteen on a table a plate of cold
meat was set a pitcher of hot milk
was beside it

   eat the dutch farmer said softly
afterward i will take you down the
cellar where you can sleep without
fear i would offer you our own bed
but you will be safer from detection
below should the soldiers come this
way again you can remain there all
day tomorrow for i presume you pre-
fer to travel by night

  waynesmiths eyes were wide he
gulped

  i-i dont understand his voice
cracked you-you seem to know
who i am

  my boy hans there the farmer
said was out looking for our cow
which has the wanderlust sometimes
he saw you running the fields then
he was stopped by a detachment of
soldiers they asked whether he had
seen such a person he said yes and
pointed in the opposite direction
when he returned he told me of it
then i saw you pass by the window

i	knew it must be you so i let you
in but eat friend eat-the milk will
grow cold

  but-but i still dont understand
waynesmith murmured you speak
as though you know me

  i do not know your name the
fight for freedom



farmer replied with a smile but i
know you are the englishman who
defied von aert in the whales mouth
and single-handed slew or disabled
seven of our alien oppressors the
news traveled ahead of you friend
by tomorrow it will have reached
utrecht and by the end of the week
it will be all over holland you will
need no money in your journey
friend

 timothy waynesmith-tim for
short the seaman said with a bow
toward the farmers wife

  his legs were trembling and he sank
into a chair but still he did not eat
listening intently to what the farmer
was saying

  you will need no money tim we
dutch will feed and shelter you
wherever you go where by the way
do you want to go

  i seek the army of the prince of
orange

  the farmers face grew grave the
prince and his forces are at present
in the besieged city of alkmaar in the
north the reports from there are not
good

  how bad are they waynesmith
asked

  bad enough for me to warn you
that you may be on your way to join
a losing cause if alkmaar falls it
will probably mean that the battle of
all holland for independence and free
worship is lost

  and if alkmaar does not fall

  if alkmaar does not fall the
farmer said slowly its successful re-
sistance against the forces of king
philip will awaken every dutch citi-
zen to the fact that victory and free-
dom are possible it will inspire
other cities to resist and revolt-even
amsterdam which is most under the
blood councils thumb

  peter the farmers wife broke in
leave off talking and let our guest
eat

  i go to alkmaar waynesmith
muttered

  yes said the farmers wife in a

soothing voice but first you must
eat then sleep then hide for a day
then you can go to alkmaar son-
she turned toward her young hans
and her eyes held a yearning light--
gaze upon this man grave his name
and face on your memory and if the
time ever comes when you can work
and worship in freedom in a land free
from invaders you will know that you
owe it in part to him

 young hans gazed upon timothy
waynesmith as he ate and timothy
waynesmith as he ate thought over
and over again i go to alkmaar i
go to alkmaar  

chapter iv

through foe and friend

timothy wayne-
smith in the hunted
days and nights that
followed moved ever
northward traveling
in darkness hiding
and resting by day-
light the dutch
farmer peter van
der tey had spoken true words the
news of the british seamans exploit
in the whales mouth traveled ahead
of him guaranteed him secret wel-
come food and shelter in farmers cot-
tage millers mill burghers manse
also ahead of him traveled the proc-
lamation of governor alva offering a
reward for his betrayal and arrest

  but the lips of all dutchmen were
sealed as to his whereabouts still
more important his exploit had awak-
ened in the hearts of the people
the will to resist their oppressors
farmers took their fowling-pieces out
of hiding and cleaned them sharpened
their scythes to a keener edge their
cattle-butchering knives to a more
deadly keenness the seeds of revolt
were sprouting secretly preparing to
bear fruit

  yet all depended on what happened
to alkmaar if alkmaar fell the seeds


thrilling adventures

would rot in disheartened ground the
will to resist would degenerate into
the wretched acceptance of defeat
and the dutch republic guarantee-
ing freedom to all races and creeds
protestant catholic jew - all-
would never be born

 when tim waynesmith fled am-
sterdam the siege of alkmaar had
already been going on for a month
governor alva had written to king
philip

  if i take alkmaar i am resolved not to
leave a single creature alive the knife
shall be put to every throat   

  the citizens of alkmaar and the
soldiers of the prince of orange now
woefully reduced in numbers did not
have to read that letter to know what
would be their fate if alkmaar fell
they resisted

  time and again the attempt was
made by the besiegers under the im-
mediate command of don frederick
to take the city by storm attack
after attack was launched against the
frisian gate and upon the red battle-
ments on the opposite side

  yet never even in haarlem which
had recently fallen had the attack of
king philips minions and mercen-
aries been received by more dauntless
breasts every living man of alkmaar
was on the walls the storming
parties were assailed by cannon that
were worn out that burst apart but
always there were fresh batteries of
cannoneers to risk manning pieces of
artillery that were even older

  musketry and pistol fire rang out
with the true aim of true dutch hearts
beating for freedom but there were
not enough muskets and pistols to go
around boiling water pitch and oil
molten lead and unslaked lime took
their places

  hundreds of tarred and burning
hoops were flung by the dutch and
skillfully quoited about the necks of
alvas soldiers who struggled to ex-
tricate themselves from these fiery
collars and as fast as any of the

  invaders planted foot upon the breach
they were confronted face to face
with sword and dagger wielded by
the burghers who hurled them head-
long into the moat below

  burghers farmers docksters fisher-
men were withstanding the disci-
plined armies of king philip

  but food within the city was run-
ning low the population was on half
rations-and then the winter freeze-
up came the moat froze ice formed
outward from the river banks and
finally lay in a solid sheet the forces
of king philip withdrew to the center
of the river encamped there and set-
tled down to wait

  they could not take the city by
storm they would starve it

  it was at this stage in the siege that
carl von aert arrived to take over the
command of don frederick

five days later another man ar-
rived not openly like von aert-
secretly stealthily he was a tall man
with a sailors gait his cheeks for-
merly sunburnt by days aloft on a
ships masthead were now blackened
with frost-bite and slightly sunken
his eyes held a burning light

 for two days this man made no
attempt to enter the city no lookout
on the battlements saw him no senti-
nel of king philips army caught a
glimpse of him yet he saw them and
for two days circling the city like a
wolf seeking a lair he studied it its
defenses in the attempt to decide on
a place of entry

  on the night of the second day he
ate the last of the food put up for him
by a dutchwoman in the village of
egmond aan zee then he made for
the moat a stick swung at his side
now and again he dropped to the ice
and his eyes invisible because the
night was fortunately moonless gazed
burningly across at some outpost sen-
tinel patrolling the moat but at a
safe distance from it lest one of the
besieged send a vat of boiling liquid
down upon him
fight for freedom



  this last fact gave the man with the
stick his chance there was a far-
flung line of such sentinels but they
were far enough apart each from the
other for a man sufficiently quick and
noiseless to dart between two of them
on the instant when they stood with
their backs turned to each other at the
ends of their patrol points and far-
thest apart from each other

  there being no moon the man with
the stick cast no shadow a blotch of
blackness his body given momentum
by a crouching run slid in prone posi-
tion to the moats edge he dropped
down into it

but his task was only half done
the other more dangerous half
consisted in the perils from the be-
sieged themselves if he were sighted
they would take him not for friend
but for foe that was why he had
studied the city so carefully and had
selected the red tower on the opposite
side for his place of entry

  from his belt he uncoiled a long
strong rope fashioned a noose then
whirling it about his head he sent it
aloft it snaked up and settled quietly
down around the towers stone corner
post without waste of time except
to thrust his stick into his belt the
man began his climb he could
scarcely believe that he had not yet
been detected but he knew the reason
for it alva had given up the attempt
to storm this tower as hopeless the
dutch knew it and accordingly had
relaxed their guard

  clambering like a monkey he was
midway to the towers top when his
heart clapped with a great thump
against his ribs and momentarily para-
lyzed his tongue a dark shape-the
upper half of a mans body-leaned
out above him he felt eyes looking
down at him he saw the shape of
something long and slender a sword

  then a voice came addressing not
him but another the man was lean-
ing out

  give rne your sword-ill cut away

  the rope the cursed mercenary will
break his bones on the ice

  the man on the rope found tongue
in the desperate hope that what had
happened throughout his long trek to
alkmaar would hold good equally in
the city itself-the racing of his name
ahead of him

  i am friend not foe he panted up
you break timothy waynesmiths
bones if you break mine

  the ensuing second seemed to
stretch away into eternity the
chance was remote that anyone could
have got into alkmaar after the first
week of the siege then waynesmith
felt a tug upon the rope for a
moment he could not believe it he
was being hauled up not being dashed
to pieces on the ice below but actu-
ally being helped to scale the tower

  a minute later he was within the
city

  there were four men on the re-
doubt only one was a soldier al-
though all had muskets the other
three were plain dutch citizens their
faces and figures flickeringly illum-
ined by the light from the torch one
of them carried

  the soldier with the sword was
trembling

mynheer waynesmit h he
breathed my god what did i almost
do this sword almost cut the rope
they were grasping his hand now
exclaiming and all talking at once

  how did news of me reach alk-
maar waynesmith asked curiously
when they finally let him speak

  one man managed to enter the city
a week ago

  tell me who and where he is so
that i may give him my thanks i owe
my life to him

  you will have to give your thanks
in heaven he was one israel ben
ezra descendant of a sephardic fam-
ily driven out of spain by ferdinand
in  living until recently in the
village of egmond he had a sick
married daughter in this city he
decided to use this as a pretext for


thrilling adventures

asking permission of the spaniards to
admit him although what he really
wanted was to tell the whole city
about you knowing well that the
people needed heartening of that
kind but when in his trustfulness
he petitioned alva alva gave him
over to his brutal mercenaries

  they beat him unmercifully and
threw him into the moat to drown
but like joshua of old there was
warrior blood in the old hebrew he
swam unseen beneath the frisian gate
and gasped out the tale of timothy
waynesmith before he died fortu-
nately you spoke your name when you
hung on that rope it would not have
been enough for you to say you were
friend not foe we are too familiar
with the blood councils treachery

  how goes it with the city tim
asked

 not good we hunger we are
not starving yet but small rations
keep our hunger perpetually alive by
tomorrow our meat will be completely
gone all animals-dogs cats-have
been slaughtered and devoured the
people are eating rats and mice when
they can catch them the outlook is
black starvation surrender-

  when all holland is getting ready
to throw off the oppressors yoke
waynesmith cut the speaker off pas-
sionately is no time to speak of
surrender take me to the prince of
orange

  two of the citizens had already left
the tower the soldier now led the
way for timothy waynesmith and
as they moved along cobbled crooked
streets the city seemed to begin to
murmur and vibrate as on the brit-
ish seamans journey to alkmaar now
when he was within the city the news
of his coming ghosted swiftly ahead
of him the streets began to fill with
women and children with citizen sol-
diers taking a hasty absence from
their posts the voices of the popu-
lace arose

  quiet waynesmith kept repeat-
ing as he walked along quiet the

work to be done must be done in
silence but take hope only it is
dangerous to risk a suspicion reaching
the outside that something unusual is
afoot within

  and the populace took up the com-
mand repeated quiet and the ex-
citement died down on the surface
but remained at a fever-pitch beneath
and timothy waynesmith was led
into the headquarters of the prince of
orange

chapter v

the stick of freedom

william of orange
sometimes called
william the silent
had seen his armies
defeated his plans for
dutch liberation over-
thrown his country-
men massacred by the
thousands his co-re-
ligionists burnt hanged and tortured
and the promises of help made to him
by elizabeth of england and charles
of france unfulfilled yet never had
he reached such a low point of despair
as in these dark days of the siege of
alkmaar

  as a result the visit of this intrepid
englishman about whom he had heard
so much was like a ray of light in a
very dark world but he was a hard-
headed man he knew how little men
could accomplish singly and how
close he was to defeat he welcomed
the coming of this englishman merely
for the opportunity of thanking him
for what he had done in the name of
the dutch people the prince of
orange did not believe in fooling
either himself or others

  well englishman he said in a
strong voice surprising waynesmith
by rising democratically to greet him
have you come to die with us

  no sire-to live waynesmith an-
swered simply

  brave words the prince said his
hands now gripping the tall seamans
fight for freedom



arms good to hear but beyond
realization i fear why did you not
stick to your ship timothy wayne-
smith-the wonderful freedom of the
open sea why did you come to die
with a defeated prince

  i repeat sire the englishman an-
swered i didnt come to die and
the prince is not defeated

  his voice quickened his frost-
blackened cheeks were shot with the
blood of his inner excitement

  sire he said you have been be-
sieged you could not know what was
happening outside your walls all
holland is awakening i have looked
into mens eyes i have heard them
speak they are ready to fight they
will fight with what weapons they
have and when those are gone they
have the will to fight on with their
bare hands all that they require to
keep that will intact to keep hope
alive in their breasts is that alkmaar
not be taken

  then they ask for the moon the
prince broke in there is no defense
against starvation

  sire waynesmith said respect-
fully forgive a sailor offering advice
to a soldier i am not expert in mili-
tary matters but sometimes a fresh
mind is able to see things which an
old campaigner misses i have scouted
the citys environs i believe i have
seen a way out

  and that way is not to defend but
to attack i william of orange said
sharply yes i know and to what
end defeat in battle by virtue of
superior numbers and superior arms
and a more merciless slaughter of the
civilian population than would other-
wise happen for with alva the
greater the resistance the more brutal
the punishment after defeat

  i was sure that the idea was not
new to you waynesmith said but
there is one element in my plan which
is absent from yours

  and what is that

  victory-not defeat

 how

  have you ever thought of opening
the sluices the dykes-flooding the
country extending out from the rear
battlements a portion of the enemy
forces are encamped there it would
reduce alvas forces by at least that
many

 but the people-my people-their
homes i could not do such a thing
without their consent

  i have already obtained their con-
sent timothy waynesmith said
quietly

the prince sat down for a min-
ute he said nothing he reached
out suddenly for waynesmiths stick
took it he nodded his head several
times he gave the seaman back the
stick he began to shake his head

  it is not enough he finally said
i know it waynesmith answered
there would still be alvas much
greater force on the frozen river
they cannot be conquered by ordi-
nary means

 you have in mind then some
extraordinary means

  yes prince

 for ten minutes the englishman
talked rapidly listening two spots
of color appeared in the princes
cheeks he drew a piece of parchment
from the writing table thrust a stylus
into waynesmiths hand and wayne-
smith understanding what was
wanted understanding too why wil-
liam was sometimes called the silent
began to sketch a rough map on the
parchment

  when he was done the prince called
out broecken a soldier appeared

  let all officers and citizen com-
manders report to me at once

  the soldier hurried off to carry out
the order the prince looked at
waynesmith again but more gently
this time he took the stick from him

  when this is over he murmured
if we are still alive which i doubt
we must give this stick a name per-
haps the best name for it    would
be    freedom  


thrilling adventures

in the largest of the tents of the
spanish encampment on the frozen
river one man sat and another man
paced the seated man was alva op-
pressor of holland the pacer was
carl von aert

  the aged alva bearing upon his
face the indelible lines of dissipation
and cruelty was running over a list of
names inscribed on parchment they
were the names of the most prominent
dutch citizens of alkmaar headed by
the burgomaster and they were all
marked for death on the gallows of
all other able-bodied citizens from
the age of fifteen up half were to be
put to the sword and half were to
be impressed as seamen into king
philips navy

  von aert his face a thunder-cloud
shot through with an apoplectic flush
paced like a timber wolf caged a
heavy-piled rug covering the ice-floor
of the tent absorbed the thud of his
heavy boots his restless walk had a
kind of rocking motion to it and as
his body rocked so his overmastering
hate rocked inside of him

  at the moment he was not thinking
of the wholesale massacre to come
when the city would surrender as it
must in spite of the subterranean
opening of the dykes and the flooding
of the countryside back of the city
that had taken place the day before
with consequent annihilation of an
entire spanish division no von aert
was thinking bitterly that he might
personally put to the sword every
living man in alkmaar and still be
unsatisfied for the one man-the
one man in all the world-the man
with the stick-

  alva glanced up eyed his fellow
blood councillor appraisingly

  still thinking about that english-
man von aert he asked quietly

  von aert stopped short the purple
flush upon his face deepened he
made no answer

  he will be found von aert he
will not get out of holland every
port is being watched and when he

is found i will make you a gift of
him so be patient von aert put
your mind upon more immediate busi-
ness the dutch can tighten their
belts so far and no farther by tomor-
row the city will be ours your work
will soon be done there and you will
have time to hunt down the man with
the stick

  alva went back to the names on the
parchment and von aert resumed his
pacing what would these two men
have thought had they known that
timothy waynesmith was within the
citys walls what would they have
thought had they known that all hol-
land was seething with preparations
for revolt awaiting only definite news
of the fate of alkmaar  what would
they have thought had they known
that timothy waynesmith had insti-
gated the opening of the dykes what
would they have thought-

  but the next instant they had no
time to think a clarion sound cut
the icy air without the tent trumpet
notes blown by a spanish bugler
pierced the ears of the two men the
call urgent eloquent with panic was
to arms

  to arms to arms against what
against whom who could be attack-
ing them the dutch impossible

 the two men grabbed up their
swords and sped out of the tent an
astounding sight greeted their eyes
on the part of their own forces con-
fusion and from the gates of alk-
maar-

  well might king philips soldiers
and the german and italian mercen-
aries know an eternal moment of
panicked paralysis two drawbridges
of alkmaar were down had come
down with a crash and their sur-
faces were not wood but ice and
over them poured the military pha-
langes of the prince of oranges
remnants of an army over them
with a few great leaps across the
frozen ground and then out upon the
river the ice

  but what was thrice astounding was
fight for freedom



the speed with which the princes
soldiers moved they did not run
yet they seemed to fly as each
phalanx of musket-armed soldiers
debouched on the river itself the
phalanx split to right and left the
members of each wing ghosting up
and down river in a flanking maneu-
ver  but the fourth phalanx moved
straight out in a frontal attack split-
ting apart only enough for the artil-
lery men immediately behind to bring
up and settle the cannon

  the artillery men maneuvered their
cannon as easily as they and the in-
fantry maneuvered themselves for
the cannon were mounted on scowlike
sledges

  and the soldiers themselves the
citizens behind them fighters all were
mounted-on skates

  that had been the idea which tim-
othy waynesmith had poured into the
princes ears so passionately dutch
boys learned to skate almost before
they could walk every hollander
skated the spaniards did not be-
sides they had no skates and an
army on skates would have a mobility
a speed of locomotion undreamed of
in warfare up to that time

  the frozen river was there it would
be the battlefield and the superiority
of alvas forces both in numbers and
weapons could be counterbalanced by
the two dutch elements of surpre
and speed

  the prince had listened had
doubted but had at last consented
now he was seeing the idea bear
fruit the first two phalanges had
already come around the spaniards
rear and were unleashing a hail of
musketry almost before alvas men
erupting from their small tents or
scattering away from the small fires
by which they kept themselves warm
had time to reach their own weapons

  but alva led a disciplined army
taken by surprise it did not break
officers ran slipped sprawled upon
the ice but even as they sprawled
they bellowed orders musketeers

here and there formed into lines
crouched on the ice fired in orderly
volleys and cannon heavier than
any the dutch had appeared on the
opposite shore manned by their
watchers

  but why if those spanish artillery
men were encamped on ground had
alva chosen to camp his forces on the
river itself he had done so because
it was open and because previously
encamped in the woods dutch sharp-
shooters from the surrounding coun-
tryside had made a practice of sniping
and picking off his officers those
dutchmen were never caught and in
fact never seen and alva could
never be sure that he would not be
next hence the bivouac on the river
itself

timothy waynesmith at

the head of the citizen-soldiers
saw those cannon

  thirty men he bellowed follow
me we must spike those guns

  the thirty men with the english-
man at their head came skating dowfi
upon a crouched line of musket-armed
mercenaries the mercenaries held
their ground discharged a volley
three of the skaters went down but
the mercenaries had no time to reload
with axes broadswords and clubbed
muskets waynesmiths dutchmen cut
them down broke through and sped
over the ice to the opposite shore

 the enemy cannon had been
brought down clear to the edge of the
ice waynesmith reached them first
amid the crack-crack of pistol and
ball his stick was thrust through his
belt both his hands were free to
manipulate a huge broadaxe to the
cannoneers seeing him in that instant
he was a fearsome figure

 the broadaxe swung it came with
a mighty crash against the wheel of
the cannon carriage smashed it with
one stroke so that the cannon settled
over on one side similar crashes
came from each side of him inter-
spersed with the crack of skulls as


thrilling adventures

well as wood it was over with start-
ling suddenness the remaining can-
noneers fled into the woods

  waynesmith immediately reassem-
bled his forces and sped out on the
river again he caught a glimpse of
the citys battlements cfowded with
women and children the women had
known the danger of lowering the
drawbridges but had consented to it
better a thousand times to die after
an attempt at victory than to lose their
men by the road of starvation fol-
lowed by surrender

a figure appeared at timothy
waynesmiths side

  it goes well a voice said they
are breaking is it time yet to send
off the couriers

  it was the prince of orange pant-
ing his eyes alight reloading his two
pistols as he sped at the british sea-
mans side

  well know in a few minutes
waynesmith panted their retreat
is cut off but we cant hold them for-
ever sooner or later we must let
what is left of them flee but we
dont want that to happen too soon
hoi a

  the last word exploded from his
chest with the pent-up force of a
breaking dyke the next instant he
had left the princes side he had
seen von aert

  but von aert had seen him too
von aert stood in a hollow square of
his mercenaries sword drawn rising
tall amid musket smoke the cold sun-
light glinting on the naked steel

  after him dutchmen the prince
cried frantically he cannot conquer
them all he seeks but one man de-
stroy the others for him o rash
englishman could you not wait

 stick out waynesmith broke
through the hollow square two mer-
cenaries writhed on the ice broken-
boned and the dutchmen sped up
to engage the others

  then surrounded by a battle within
a battle ears ringing with the clash

of weapons and the gasips and groans
of the combatants a man with a sword
fought a man with a stick

  von aerts eyes alive with hate
were alive with impending triumph
too here at close fighting his an-
tagonists skates were no advantage
might even be a disadvantage and
a stick was no match for a sword-a
sword wielded moreover by a master
fencer

  but timothy waynesmith did not
wield that stick as any of von aerts
duel victims had ever wielded their
swords none of the accepted modes
of duelling were executed by that
stick none of the parries feints
thrusts lunges and as it is some-
times more perilous for a master
fencer to duel with a novice than with
an expert so fear began to come to
von aert-fear and desperation

  timothy waynesmiths frost-black-
ened cheeks flamed fire his great
chest expanded into speech

  die damned butcher he cried
your sword drinks no more blood

  with the words he was wide open
for von aerts deadly thrust but his
stick whirled with incredible rapidity
in front of him wood rang suddenly
against steel von aerts sword shot
up and tim waynesmith stopped
the stick short at the top of its smok-
ing circle reversed its course and
felled von aert with it as an ox is
felled the german crashed upon the
ice and his sword shot fifty feet away
from him but he no longer had need
of it he was dead

  straightening waynesmith shot his
gaze up and down the river a hand
grasped his arm he whirled

  its time he said to the prince of
orange release the couriers tell
them to spread the news that alkmaar
is dutch that alvas armies are flee-
ing and that the people must now
complete the task by driving the in-
vaders into the sea

  it was then that he first became
aware of a great and spine-thrilling
noise it came from the city and was
fight for freedom



made by the throats of the crowds on
its battlements it was a paean of vic-
tory it was a song of gladness over
the fact that now there was food for
the invaders had left behind provi-
sions as well as arms

  all these were gathered up and
taken into the city it took several
hours and was finished by torchlight
for the sun had set then couriers be-
gan to come in from the surrounding
country the armies of king philip
in retreat were being met by revolt-
ing villagers and farmers the dutch
people were at last fully launched on
their fight for independence which
would not end until they had obtained
it

  that night in alkmaars public
square lit by flambeaux and torches
the prince of orange faced a tall sea-
man with frost-blackened cheeks the
towns scribe stood nearby inscribing
on parchment what was being said

  tim waynesmiths voice was un-
steady he looked at his stick which
the prince held all about him crowd-
ing the square the people strained to
catch what he was saying

  i thank you and the dutch people

for letting me fight you will set
yourselves free you cannot be stopped
now and i-all men-will be freer
because you are free

  yes timothy waynesmith but
we will be freer because of you the
struggle for freedom is long and hard
but it will be won the right of all
men to worship god in their own ways
-holland will offer that right to all--
the people of all races and creeds
catholics protestants jews-all men
and now after taking your stick i
give it back to you with my sword
the stick was without a name now it
has a name it is freedom take it
and take my sword

  waynesmith took them buckled
belt and sword around him then he
quietly handed the stick back

  it would please me if you kept the
stick he said only-and he smiled
-if i ever need it again id like to
know i can have it

  you can have anything you ask for
timothy waynesmith

  the stick is enough sire

  yes-the prince nodded- free-
dom is all that a man needs with it
he can obtain everything else

how an american blacksmith set sail to conquer the
arctic and to bring back news of the
ill-fated sir john franklin expedition

especially written for thrilling adventures

by charles s strong

explorer traveler and historian-author of washingtons first railroad
twentieth century lapland etc

mind he was far away-in the far
northland the frozen arctic he was
living doughty deeds his heart was
with the men who had gone explor-
ing there-sir john franklin who
had sailed in his famous polar ship
erebus and captain richard crozier
with his own dauntless crew in the
good ship terror

  for word had just come that the
intrepid explorers and their men
were lost somewhere in the frozen
wastes in common with a nation
the blacksmith shuddered over their
fate expeditions it was said were
being formed to search for them
men of strength of courage of dar-
ing would be needed men who-

brawny arm and brought it down

the second in a new
series of thrilling

sparks flew from the black-
smith forge on charles fran-

scure mid-west village sweat poured
from his sturdy body as heat swept
out in shimmering waves from his
blazing fire but the blacksmiths
mind was not on the heat nor the

world of their last resting place

faced difficult odds

  that decision was one that made
the name of charles francis hall
buckeye state blacksmith one that
is outstanding in the annals of ex-
ploration with little more than his
own high courage and determination
he was to face odds that had stopped
many a man better equipped-and win
through obstacles were many some-
times heart-breaking but he over-
came them

  his first attempt to go to the aid
of the men in the heartless clutch of
the relentless ice-lands was made
when he tried to become a member of
the famous grinnell expedition hop-
ing to accompany dr kane and lieu-
tenant de haven-but he was re-
fused

  he tried it again when mcclintock
set out with the fox in  again
he was left behind

  there seemed nothing for it but to
go himself but he had no boat   

sir john franldin

what of it very well he would
get one he did and called it the
rescue but it had no chance of doing
any rescuing of either franklin and
his crew or anyone else in the arctic
for it was wrecked when a storm

sailed away-and never came back

  as other explorers had done since
hudsons time sir john franklin set
out on the same search

  with almost forty years of explor-
ation and adventure behind him-ad-
venture which had taken him from
tasmania and the south seas to the
cold wind-swept ice cap of the polar
regions-sir john franklin sailed
from england in may of  high
hope for success was in his heart
and in the hearts of his hand-picked
crew-but it did not last long

  two months later his ice-shrouded
erebus and the accompanying terror
under captain croziers command

explorers camp at baffin island northwest territory

struck him on september   in
cyrus field bay

  there were other ways of conquer-
ing the arctic though he tried
them all-trudging over ice and snow
and arctic tundra moving ever
northward by dog sled or by leaky
small boat-and finally by wearisome
years spent with the eskimos he was
sure he knew the secret of the van-
ished sir john franklin expedition

a record of achievement
and he was right for it was finally
from the eskimos that hall was able
to learn what had happened to the
explorers and at last give to the

world the record of their deeds as he
read them there in the white and
frozen land that encircles the arctic
pole

  the blacksmith who had no money
no friends in washington in power-
ful place who had been refused when
he had offered his all-his courage
and healthy body-had won when
gold poured out freely and science
and men equipped with all possible
aids had failed

  the story of the continued search
for the northwest passage is epic
henry hudson was the first to search
for it in the early s from the
atlantic to the pacific but whether
he found it or not is a secret of the
centuries romantic tales though
and legends are in abundance con-
cerning that search on which he

were last seen at the mouth of lan-
caster sound in baffin bay captain
dannet master of the whaler prince
of wales reported that he had seen
the two vessels moored to icebergs
waiting for the ice to open so that
they could proceed on their course
their intention was to sail into baffin
bay then through lancaster sound
to barrow strait at cape walker
they were to turn south and west for
behring strait this route would
have taken them through melville
sound and parry sound

         searching parties
when months went by with no
further word from either sir john
franklins ship and the accompany-
ing vessel of captain crozier fears
were felt for the safety of the more
the northwest passage



than one hundred men plans for
searching parties were made quickly
by both england and the united
states several rescue expeditions
eventually set out but americans
were chiefly interested in one that was
commanded by lieutenant de haven
of the united states navy two
staunch vessels advance and rescue
had been equipped for the de haven
expedition the funds having been
furnished by henry grinnell a new
york merchant and public-spirited
citizen they sailed from new york
harbor on may th 

most of the searchers for the lost
franklin both english and ameri-

west of cape riley at the entrance
to wellington channel he found an
embankment for a house with car-
penters and armorers workshops
but he also found a mute and poign-
ant commentary - three graves of
men who had sailed on the erebus
and terror

  the simple markers bore the date of
the winter -

     the northwest passage
the american expedition arrived
two days later and joined in the
search among the members of lieu-
tenant de havens party was dr e
k kane surgeon for the rescue

musk-oxen at cape spaibo devon island

can headed for the spot where the
erebus and the terror had last been
sighted by the whaler prince of
wales the first of the rescue expe-
ditions to find any trace of the miss-
ing explorers was captain ommany
of the british navy commanding the
ship assistance at cape riley far
up in lancaster sound on the morn-
ing of august   captain om-
many and his crew spotted a camp
site

  close investigation showed it to be
merely the stone flooring of a tent
a scattering of birds bones and a
forlorn heap of empty meat cans

  shortly after lieutenant osborne
who had left england in the ship
intrepid accompanying captain om-
many discovered the winter quarters
of the missing expedition three miles

party he was the first member of
the various expeditions-ten of them
based at beechey island during a
single week in august -who
began to collate the information being
gathered

 he discovered markings at the
camp-site that seemed to be traces of
heavy-laden sledges and judged that
they had gone north from cape riley
he decided that sir john franklin
must have gone through wellington
channel to the polar basin one of
the two american boats the advance
sailed as far as possible in this direc-
tion hoping to learn more but pack
ice finally halted the vessel

  however dr kanes theory in re-
gard to the wellington channel
route made such an impression in
england that an expedition of five


thrilling adventures

vessels left the british isles in april
 under the command of sir ed-
ward belcher dr kane himself
waited until the spring of  when
the same henry grinnell of new
york who had backed the previous
venture and george peabody of lon-
don outfitted an expedition and
placed kane in command

  it was on this trip to the polar
regions that the northwest passage
sought for so many hundreds of
years was actually found two ves-
sels passed through it at almost the
same time one coming east from
behring sea and the other going
west from baffin bay

  the investigator under the com-
mand of captain mcclure made the
trip through from the west and the
plover under command of captain
kellet sailed through from the east
for this exploit one that was of
world interest although no relics of
the franklin expedition were found
captain mcclure was knighted by
queen victoria

  the final british expedition more
or less laid the groundwork for the
far-reaching and romantically inter-
esting explorations of the american
blacksmith charles francis hall

lady franklins hopes

  after such repeated efforts to find
the lost explorers in the silent north
-and failures-further attempts be-
gan to seem futile but there was one
person that refused to give up-the
ever-loyal wife of sir john franklin
with only the faintest hope-if that
-of finding any of the members of
the expedition alive lady franklin
made a last effort to locate her hus-
band she fitted out the steam-yacht
fox at aberdeen scotland on july
st  and placed it under the
command of her devoted friend cap-
tain mcclintock

  starting out for beechey island
and the last known camp-site of sir
john and his men the fox was
caught in the pack ice off melville
bay and finally drifted to the vicin-
ity of disco

  the boat and its men drifted for ten
months covering eleven hundred and
ninety-four miles

  the fox was refitted at disco and
captain mcclintock made an attempt
to regain his lost ground he had
picked up a tombstone at goodhavn
greenland this had been prepared
in new york at the direction of lady
franklin and had been sent to the
greenland port by a relief ship sent
to locate the american dr kane
there still was hope in her courage-
ous ladyships heart but if that
should fail her she wanted to mark
the site where her husband had per-
ished in his efforts to advance the
cause of humanity

  in  captain mcclintock man-
aged to reach beechey island and
erected the monument in a suitable
and conspicuous spot to him there
was only one answer sir john and
his men were dead and a monument
to their bravery at this spot was al-
together fitting

  then following a route that took
him through prince regent inlet to
bellot strait and franklin channel
he finally brought the fox to king
william land here on the very
spot that had been charted by dr
kane as the likely main camp of the
lost expedition captain mcclintock
managed to find remains of the miss-
ing men

  at erebus bay named after frank-
lins boat he found a life-boat in
which lay two skeletons-all that was
left of two men identified as having
been two of the missing explorers

  mcclintocks lieutenant hobson
had found at victory point at the
same time the record of the death of
the gallant sir john but what be-
came of the rest of the crew who had
sailed with him to a frozen death re-
mained a mystery until hall the
blacksmith now glorying in the re-
sounding title of captain hall went
into action

captain hall takes a hand

  hall who later reached a pinnacle
of fame that made him the com-
mander of the ill-fated polaris ex-
pedition sent out by the united
states navy was born in rochester
new hampshire but was taken with
his family to ohio when he was still
a youngster before he devoted his
the northwest passage



life to exploration and rescue parties
young hall tried his hand at many
things including seal-making and
journalism but it was as a black-
smith that he shone best and this
work undoubtedly built up the body
that stood him in good stead against
the arctic winters even in this
trade however he chafed at the re-
straint

  he sought to accompany de haven
but permission was refused this
only made him more determined
true he had no money but he had
enthusiastic friends with their aid
he finally managed to get together
enough money to buy a small boat
he meant to take it into the arctic
and make his search alone or with
the possible assistance of the eski-
mos

  doom of the expedition ship

  with his small expedition ship
as he called the sailing craft he
boarded one of the arctic supply
ships at new london on may th
 fifteen years after sir john
franklin had set out halls aim was
to proceed north and west in search
of living members of the franklin
expedition

  his sailing craft was destined to an
early doom however being wrecked
in a storm in cyrus field bay on
september th 

  the wreck of his ship might have
discouraged a less virile and deter-
mined man than captain hall but in-
stead it spurred him on he set out
to succeed and he would he man-
aged to round up a dog sledge a
team and a leaky boat and with
these remained in the arctic for two
and one half years

ask the eskimos

  from what he had gathered from
the natives at frobisher bay he had
become convinced that the eskimos
knew the secret of the vanished sir
john franklin expedition and that
the only way to break the silence of
these people was by living with them
and gaining their confidence these
ideas were so deeply rooted in his
mind that he planned a better-
equipped return to the arctic and so

that he would know more of what he
was about he decided to live with
the natives for five years

  when he did return to civiliza-
tion he brought with him two na-
tives named ebierbing and tookoo-
lito

  he renamed them joe and hannah
which came easier to him and they
proved invaluable to him later on as
guide and interpreter

  immediately captain hall an-
nounced that he intended to make a
new exploration trip to the polar re-
gions and many of his old friends
came to his aid again he added to
their contributions by lecturing dur-
ing the winter of -

  on august st  charles
francis hall was back in the arctic
circle beginning his five years with
the eskimos he was put ashore at
depot island in repulse bay with his
two eskimos from the bark monti-
cello captain richard w chappel
commanding

  his hunch that the eskimos knew
more than they had told proved to be
correct he gained much information
that had been withheld from the of-
ficers and men of other searching
parties for upward of fifteen years

thrilling adventures

besides his actual exploration and
research work he also supplied the
men of the crew of the monticello
with fresh meat in the shape of musk-
oxen bear and deer

  the fascinating story of halls five
years with the eskimos would fill a
heavy tome but what he learned
from his eskimo friends and what he
was able to accomplish as a result of
that information is of vital historic
interest for one thing he learned
that one of franklins boats with
five men aboard actually made the
first trip through the northwest
passage for some reason these five
survivors had abandoned the boat in
perfect order and it had been found
frozen in the ice by the eskimos in
the spring of  near oreilly
island

 halls search was wide and thor-
ough he found the skeletons of
franklins men scattered over king
william land and he learned one
important reason why they had not
survived the natives had refused to
assist the lost explorers with food
and shelter instead they considered
their coming only as an excellent op-
portunity to plunder them

cannibalism

  captain hall was the recipient of
hair-raising confidences of how when
the franklin men were too weak to de-
fend themselves the eskimos turned
their half wild dogs on them and
permitted the wolflike animals to de-
vour the white men rumors of can-
nibalism among the english sailors
too were confirmed by halls re- 
searches

  he believed that the original rec-
ords of the erebus and terror were
still in existence at cape victory or
victory point but was unable to
reach the point himself because of a
tribal war between the natives of the
region he did however collect more
than one hundred and fifty relics of
the franklin expedition from the
natives including personal belong-
ings of officers and men and fittings
from the ships

  in  captain hall uncovered the
interesting fact that captain crozier
of the terror with lyon parry and

another sailor had survived the
others after the expedition had been
almost completely wiped out by cold
and starvation the evidence indi-
cated that crozier had been alive un-
til the fall of  or while hall was
actually searching for him-nearly
twenty years after the expedition
under command of sir john had left
england

battling with indians

  franklins party had fought a bat-
tle with a tribe of indians near the
estuary of the great fish river the
american explorer learned and after
this captain crozier and two of his
men had made an attempt to cross
the northwest territory hoping to
gain either fort churchill or york
factory at either of these well-
known hudson bay company posts
they would have found men to aid
them they had been traveling in
skin or rubber boats but their at-
tempt was a failure

  in  captain hall had addi-
tional information indicating that
captain crozier and one other man
had survived until  and he heard
of other sailors in king william
land but these rumors finally pe-
tered out and at last hall was forced
to the conclusion that no men of the
franklin expedition were still alive
not until then did he give up his
search and trek south to the limit of
the pack-ice boarding the bark an-
sel gibbs there he returned to new
bedford mass

a century of effort

  sir john franklins expedition
and the stories of the various search-
ing parties english and american
will always be among the thrilling
adventures on this continent to this
day government expeditions still
rummage about on beechey island in
hope that they will finally gather the
complete story of the climax to the
centuries-long effort to locate the
northwest passage

and to this day the thrill of expe-
ditions and rescue parties persists
there can be no better proof of that
than the excited interest that was

the fatal knife etc

francois renault sat at

his ease on the thin-roofed ver-
anda and sipped appreciatively
at his gin

  of a certainty he smiled at the
linen-suited straight-backed men who
even in the heat stood about stiffly
and unrelaxed i would say your
scientific expedition has a most wor-
thy purpose you wish to lease the
cove from me and the land adjoin-
ing in order to further your study
of marine life you wish to erect sci-
entific laboratories he paused to
take another sip and the rental
the tall blond man who was the
leader nodded wordlessly from a
thick wallet he withdrew a sheaf of
bills and counted out five thousand
dollars in english pounds renault
took the money with a smile placed
it in a hip pocket with a slight shrug
and the contract

 the blond man spoke brusquely
the signing of papers is not neces-
sary monsieur renault you are
dealing with gentlemen

 renault made a deprecating ges-
ture but of course how indis-

tom payne

creet of me even to mention it you
will join me in a drink-gentlemen

  he rang a little dinner bell and
sam his papuan boy padded from
inside the house with a tray of
glasses limes and another bottle of
gin   

  the little island of francois re-
nault nearer to australia than the
philippines and nearer to heaven than
either nestled serenely in the broad
bosom of the south pacific a verita-
ble paradise of lush vegetation coral
beaches and calm magnificent tropic
nights the island did a steady de-
pendable business in copra cocoanut
oil and mangoes all of which pro-
vided renault with a medium but
comfortable income kept the natives
happy and assured the infrequent
visitor of a warm and friendly wel-

thrilling adventures

 not tom payne however payne
had arrived the night before drip-
ping wet and unheralded no one
paid him any particular attention the
next morning when refreshed from a
nights sleep under the brilliant stars
he went inshore his strong easy
strides oddly set off by sun-dried
white shirt and trousers he bummed a
meal of taro poi and cocoanut milk
from a native hut beachcombers
were nothing new on renaults island
and this husky clean-featured white
man had a most reassuring smile

  payne in his own way made quite
a day of it he walked up and down
the clean sandy beach for hours toss-
ing shells into limpid lagoons and
skipping smooth flat rocks over the
waters surface he took off his shirt
and pillowed it under his head let-
ting the hot sun bake more copper
into his smooth brown back later
in the afternoon he went for a swim
and a bunch of native boys dived in
after him and they played tag in
the warm blue waters until payne
laughingly ducked one of the young-
sters and made for the shore shak-
ing the sea out of his wet hair

twilight came with its sym-
phony of reds yellows and deep
purples and swiftly the island and the
sea were swept with the soft blanket
of night night and tom payne was
no longer the laughing-eyed beach-
comber quietly now like a silent
wraith payne made his way to the
extreme end of the island his eyes
cool but his features hard

  as he approached the sheltered lit-
tle cove which francois renault had
leased that very morning he drew up
short and his eyes narrowed for
a scientific expedition this outfit was
certainly going to work as though
they had a hurricane by the tail
gasoline flares strewn about the shore
and for a hundred yards inland
lighted the labors of some fifty men

  out in the cove a steady proces-
sion of small dories went to anj from

a compact squat little steamer riding
heavily at anchor in the coves gentle
wash payne drew nearer to the
headland strained his eyes in the
darkening night a dory scraped
shore was immediately drawn up by
a half-dozen brawny arms swiftly
and efficiently bags of cement were
transferred to waiting wheelbarrows
which took them fifty yards inshore
to deposit them before heavy canvas
tents on the shore already were
piles of lumber bundles of iron rods
and off to one side packing cases
which might have held anything from
construction tools to canned foods

  payne whistled softly under his
breath the boys are certainly going
at it great guns he muttered hm-m
-this is just the first few loads they
must have enough stuff in that ship
to build a fort look how low she
rides in the water

  lips compressing he slipped off his
clothes and made for the black water
his black bathing trunks sagged a
little around the waist hed left
them behind a clump of bushes when
hed gone swimming that afternoon
not very sensible he knew to let
the natives see the bulgy little pocket
around the waistband which contained
the water-proof packet of matches-
and the compact stick of dynamite

  easily he swam toward the ship
drew up beside the anchor chain
breathing deeply he had made a
wide circuit of the ship and come in
from the starboard side to escape the
dories the little boats were still
going and coming in a steady stream
and evidently intended to keep it up
until the late hours

  face grim body tensely alert payne
used a hanging rope to haul himself
aboard there were no sentries about
obviously every man available had
been put to work steathily payne
hid behind a pile of packing cases on
the deck watching his opportunity
when a couple of men working in
the hold came up for a breath of air
and a smoke payne saw his chance
a matter of cash



and darted down the forward hatch
his bare feet padding soundlessly

  suddenly there was a sound behind
him payne whirled eyes narrowed
in the hot cargo-laden hold his
eyes had already taken in swiftly the
bags of cement the cases of machin-
ery the engineering equipment now
he saw the burly brute-browed sea-
man emerging from the connecting
door which led probably to the en-
gine room

  startled the man stared at the
trunk-clad swimmer with wide blank
eyes then sudden comprehension
tightening his harsh heavy features
he opened his mouth to bellow a
warning and sprang forward in a lum-
bering rush the heavy wrench in his
hand raised like a club

  the shout died aborning in his
throat like a human catapult payne
had launched himself across the hold
his eyes blazing his right fist drawn
back like a leashed mallet in the
twinkling of an eye bone-hard knuc-
kles smashed out buried themselves
in the yielding cartilage of the thick
fleshy throat the burly man fell
back choking and spitting blood then
brought the wrench down on paynes
left shoulder

  eyes hard payne drew back his
fist and shot it home to the burly
fellows midriff the engine room
man said whoof as his stomach col-
lapsed and he crumpled to the board
flooring in agony retching violently
blowing on his knuckles payne
reached down grabbed hold of the
wrench and let the brute have it

  breathing a little more easily in
relief tom payne hurried into the
engine room and over to a corner
he could hear the waves outside lap-
ping softly against the steel plating
not a safe cracksman payne went to
work then with an efficiency which
any bank mob would have applauded
he opened the little pocket in his
trunks attached a short fuse to the
heavily charged stick of dynamite
and wedged the explosive into a

crevice then he lighted the fuse
with a safety match and almost in
the same motion was running toward
the opposite end of the engine room
from which he had entered

 he made his way back on deck
heart beating wildly with strain and
excitement and dived with a soft
splash into the mothering sea he
was just breaking water yards from
the ship when he heard what he
thought was a cry of alarm the
engine room man then must have
been discovered ten seconds later
there came a muffled explosion payne
could hear it through the water

  the overladen steamer seemed to
rise just a trifle in the gentle swell
then it settled back slowly rocking
a bit from side to side payne could
see the crew escaping as he swam
in a great circle around the cove
and when he reached shore panting
but with shining eyes the ship had
already settled to the main deck in
the water a stranded sodden squat
shadow in a background of throbbing
darkness and yellow starlight   

francois renault sat on his

thin-roofed porch next morning
sipping his gin with the leisure that
had been rudely interrupted but ten
minutes before by the leader of the
expedition and a half-dozen of his
men white-faced haggard and bit-
terly angry now they were gone
renault sighed a little tiredly

  a young man in white shirt and
trousers a little blood stain on the
left shoulder came around the cor-
ner of the porch then nodded easily
to the frenchman and seated himself
on the veranda he poured himself
a drink and downed it in a gulp he
smiled and fixed himself another

  your friends left but a few mo-
ments ago renault observed quietly
but his eyes were smiling

 they kept me waiting payne
grinned boy does this drink hit
the spot

 shangll fry him in his own
grease chuckled the lanky puncher
come on lets tell him whats
cornin

 they batted eagerly through the
batwing doors to seek out their burly
ramrod who was somewhere in the
smoke-choked clamorous saloon it
was filled with a dot men slaking
roundup dust from their parched
throats elbowing through the noisy
crowd the two punchers shoved up to
shang ringo lazing indolently against
the bar a glass of red-eye poised in
his malletlike fist

  jess randles ridin this way boss
all spread out to six-gun lengths
across the britches an lookin for

 yeah added the other hes
freighted down to the hocks for a
gunsmoke frolic and sittin tight in

 shang ringo mountainous a dot
range boss stiffened his beady eyes
danced with battle lights he tossed
down his drink and a surly grin split
his thick lips as he straightened his
hulking body to full height his big
fists began clenching and unclenching
as he turned to the barkeep

 gimme my guns corkscrew he
commanded gruffly

  the twisted old bronc snapper who
now dispensed liquor because an out-
law hammerhead had tramped his
spine shook his head

  not unless yuh go outside shang
the floors of the bottoms up aint
ever been stained by nothin but
knuckle blood and they aint gonna
be long as im roddin it step out on
the walk an ill hand yuh back yore
cutters

 before ringo could give voice to
the curse choking him the swing doors
batted open eyes in the room focused
on the young nester framed there bel-
ligerently

  jess randle had to stoop slightly
to keep his cone-peaked jb hat from
brushing the top jamb of the door he
was lean and willowy with the angu-
lar frame of a man born in the saddle
hard work and harder riding gave him
the temper of steel a lonely exist-
ence on his little rocking r spread
had stamped his ruggedly handsome
face with an impassiveness that was
unreadable his amber-flecked gray
eyes were like mirrors that reflected
the bitter turmoil of his soul the
toil of a nester fighting a lone fight in
an antagonistic country had made him
look more mature than he really was
his fine lips were creased into thin
lines now white about the corners

  before he could step into the bar-
room corkscrew was relieving him
of his guns with one swift jerk but
when randles eyes lit on shangs gun-
less thighs he made no protest
slowly he stepped toward the a dot
ramrod

indolently shang faced him
his elbows akimbo his lips
formed a cast-iron grin and deep
scorn puckered his eyelids

  im short ten head ringo the
young nester said resonantly
through my scope i saw em bein
hazed into yore shippin cars from
bald knob lessn an hour ago thats
ten yuh owe me-or a hundred apiece
for prime beef

 a guffaw swelled from ringos
throat

a few scurvied culls that strayed got
caught in our roundup where was

  a rush of blood to his temples made
jess randles hair tingle at the roots
ringos arrogance galled him it had
been a bold deliberate steal and he
knew it hot resentment simmered
within him

wagon he gritted he wouldnt have
seen them ten head yuh think yuhre
big enough in this valley to call it a
mistake ringo but i call it plain
ordinary rustlin

all color fled from ringos swart
face

  why yuh sin-pimpled son- he
swore luridly if a feller rustled
everything you owned he wouldnt
tally enough to buy his way into the
pore house as for rustlin -his
voice dropped wickedly-thats some-
thin you should know plenty about
randle ive checked up on yuh-
down wyomin way before yuh
squatted on a dot grazin land yore
name wasnt randle a-tall it was-
easy ringo randle cut in softly
dont make me kill yuh for blattin
off yore mouth promiscuous

  ringos barrel chest swelled kill
me he snarled you aint got the
red mcvey bunch at yore back now
you was one of em randle yuhre
jess mcvey brother o that no good
renegade red mcvey

  yuhre a liar ringo randle
snapped hotly i never rode with
red mcvey in my life sweet cover-
up yuhre tryin sos yuh can get my
land and water the a dot needs
yuhre jess mcvey or im a chink
cook sneered ringo since virge
addison got interested in you and
yore doins old kim had me smell yuh
down he gave me my orders im re-
layin em to you renegade-get goin
an dont come back

  jess randle could sense the tighten-
ing of the circle of a dot punchers
about him this was showdown one
against the most powerful outfit in
big timber valley if he allowed this
accusation to whip him he would have
to ride on and wherever he went it
vould be the same the name of his
notorious gunslick brother would
catch up with him renegade - get
going those three words would
devil him to the grave

  six months of hard labor all his

money and a certain degree of for-
getfulness were in that little spread
hunkering on the toes of smoky
buttes three years and six months
yet to go before the government would
give him clear title to the land a life-
time to go facing down the stigma
red mcvey had attached to him
the reputation of his owlhoot brother
haunted him

  until now he had succeeded in
burying his identity in the big tim-
ber and he had come to love his
place the country-and one of its peo-
ple there was a lift to its glorious
dawns when the sun painted the sheep
blue mountains with pastel shades
easy comfort to the velvety nights
when he could sit on his small corral
fence smoke and commune with the
glittering stars listen to the low mur-
mur of big dry creek as it cut lazy
scallops through his land

  and virge addison supple capable
lovely daughter of the a dot owner
her powerful parents had spoiled her
a bit yet she was the true princess of
a cattle king beneath her proud
haughty exterior beat a heart of gold
that needed the touch of tragedy to
give her a better understanding of life
in the raw all men knelt to her
beauty all but jess randle the nester
of smoky buttes perhaps that was
why she was so interested-and some-
times came to see him against her
fathers wishes but he loved her his
indifference was only a mask to cover
his shyness

  now the skeleton in his closet rat-
tled again the curse had caught up
with him once more struggling val-
iantly as he was he needed the good
wishes of the country instead of its
distrust and enmity

  two things combined to bring about
what he faced now-virge addison
and the long drought the a dot could
use his water kim addison didnt
want him seeing virge he could fight
down his yearning to see the girl per-
haps make a concession of his water
but face this accusation-


thrilling adventures

  his tone was flat and convincing
when he spoke

  im goin nowhere ringo nothin
can be gained by runnin its taken
me from cheyenne clear to the rio
bravo an back to find that out a man
cant get away from himself-or a
reputation i like it here and aim to
stay im also collectin on ten head
o rockinr beef jest what yuh got
in mind to do about it

  in the charged silence he read the
hate in shang ringos somber eyes
and he realized that jealousy was the
foundation of it all shangs swart
face reflected all his inner emotions
an inner fire burned to white heat at
the mention of virges name ringo
was out to disgrace randle and elim-
inate a rival

  the ramrods huge fists clenched
into balls

  what im gonna do is learn yuh
that renegades aint wanted in big
timber he ground out i got it fig-
gered yuhre here spyin for yore rot-
ten brother and he struck

  like a steel spring suddenly uncoil-
ing jess randle whipped up his right
fist and beat him to the punch it
cracked solidly against ringos rock-
like jaw staggered him back against
the bar

 a howl went up from the a dot
waddies a strange admixture of sur-
prise and threat shang ringo was the
best bunkhouse scrapper in montana
and here he was pinned groggily
against the bar by the gaunt nesters
first blow they surged forward claw-
ing for a chance at the insolent brother
of red mcvey

  ringos enraged bellow drove them
back

  ill take his taw fore this knuckle-
down game is over he shouted im
skinnin this sidewinder alive an
shovin his rattles down his throat

  a dot voices lifted to bedlam
taunts and insults were hurled at the
lone nester but randle shut their
frenzied clamor from his ears and
steeled himself to the avalanche of

blows ringo would throw at him he
was fighting for more than life now
struggling for the right to hold up his
head in big timber valley-fighting
to protect his self-respect for virge
addison

  he knew he faced a ruthless force
that of gossip and reputation he
must live them both down his fresh
start all hinged on the power in his
fists upon the necessity of winning to
let men know he defended his rights
to make men afraid to consider him
the brother of an outlaw to win was
to go on to lose-

  he bellied to shang ringos savage
rush

chapter ii
renegades not wanted

s cold and calculating
as a robot jess randle
lashed at ringos burly
figure he scarcely felt
the pistonlike blows drill-
ing his body and face
his only urge was to dust
away the leering counte-
nance before him with his knuckles

 he saw stolid determination in
ringos face then it turned beet-red
as he became more cautious of this
willowy youngster who kept at him
relentlessly as blood spurted ringos
crimson mask showed fatigue which
made his veins stick out

  randle felt a cold joy in battling
his thrashing arms were making the
a dot ramrod eat his words slug-
ging feinting jabbing shifting he
alternated his one-twos-first to the
body then to the head the ring of
excited faces was but a pale and vague
background

  then ringo seemed to get his sec-
ond wind his sneer came again to his
lips he bore down like fresh pres-
sure applied to a juggernaut furi-
ously he swarmed at the nester
pounding pushing pummeling des-
perate now to knock this half-smiling
youngster fmm his feet
renegade payoff



  they tangled in a clinch like two
great bulls locked in deatjlj embrace
they grunted to the strain the only
noise now was the squeak of boots on
the sawdust floor

  the air gushed sobbingly from ran-
dles lungs he fought down the urge
to try to twist free from this awful
hug he knew such an effort would
spell defeat success lay in hugging
harder and sapping the strength from
his powerful opponent

  throwing full leverage of his steel-
like muscles into that embrace he
could feel the grip of the ramrod
slacken he gulped fresh air into his
tortured lungs and clinched harder

  slowly ringo bent back gasps of
astonishment tore from the throats of
the onlookers the saloon was packed
now with townspeople who had heard
the din

  a savage snarl of satisfaction bared
randles teeth he was tasting the
cup of victory and finding the nectar
sweet he was crushing the arrogance
from this surly ranch foreman ringo
was whimpering like a child his back
bending like a bow

  suddenly the overbalanced weight
started them toward the floor randle
caught the devilish gleam in the cow-
mans eyes then he felt hlorrible pains
shoot from his groin making his head
whirl dizzily blackness blanketed his
eyes and sickness swept him he felt
the jar as he lit atop ringo and the
ramrod rolled free shang ringo had
kneed him like a rattler striking in the
dark

  groveling on the floor he tried to
rise he had to get up and continue
with his battle but his nerve-numbed
body would not respond he twitched
to the solid thud of boots into his
sides	 

  his body was one hell of misery
strength had drained from him like
wheat pouring from a split sack
courage that had flamed so brightly
within him guttered weakly he no
longer had control of himself he was
conscious only of awful pains as he

sank into a bottomless pit of oblivion
his last conscious thought was that he
had lost-lost another battle to arro-
gant and powerful enemies it meant
riding on losing all his dreams virge
addison his homestead his cup of
bitterness was full when merciful
oblivion took it from him   

just as shang ringo aimed a vi-
cious kick at the unconscious
young nesters lolling head marshal
clem cottles burst into the center of
the arena his gun cleared leather
cracking the cowman sharply behind
the ear the ramrod collapsed like a
punctured balloon

  the marshal glared at the belliger-
ent crowd

  these fellers are under arrest for
disturbin the peace he cracked out
theres only one way to fight in
lodge pole town-thats fight with
me a dot punchers-gig yore ponies
for home tell old kim addison i got
his salty ramrod on ice until his fines
paid the rest of yuh can drink or go
home makes no matter to me

  thats red mcveys brother yuhre
jailin marshal stated someone

  callously the lawman turned the
prone nester over his hand stroked
his chin thoughtfully

  i dont care iffn hes butch cas-
siday he announced he aint com-
mitted no crime but fightin in lodge
pole until he breaks a bigger law
than that-hes in for disturbin the
peace

  the crowd broke up if they knew
their marshal the young nester had a
long stretch facing him in the town
jail the puncher who had spotted
randle riding into town jabbed iris
partner in the ribs as they moved out-
side damn if that nester wasnt
givin shang a whuppin until the boss
knee caught im in the belly he whis-
pered hoarsely he done it a-purpose
-i could see that shang would a-kilt
im if cottles hadnt showed up

  yuhre right muttered the other
randle doled out one large helpin


thrilling adventures

o hell fore he caved he had one o
his cow critters outa shangs hide and
was fixin to get his good name back
when it happened them two wont
have much room now for nothin but
hate powderll be burnt-shore as
yuhre born

a chilled body brought jess
randle to his senses he peered
through the slits of his swollen eyes
and made out the iron bars hemming
him in abruptly he sat up the move-
ment made him sick and dizzy a
rasping voice came from the dark cor-
ner of the cell

 easy pard there aint much
wrong with yuh but broke ribs a
busted nose mouses under yore eyes
two teeth missin one ear bloomin
like cauliflower an yore belly pushed
clean to yore backbone once them
things mend yuhll be good as new
in the gloom the young nester could
make out the slope-shouldered oldster
on the cot across from him a bristly
walrus mustache drooped from under
his long and predatory nose below it
were thin but kindly lips an enor-
mous cud of fine-cut bulged his leath-
ery cheek he was typical of the
range men who grow old in the saddle
drift from spread to spread during
roundup to pick up small change to
see them through the winters the
word drifter wa deep-stamped on
his faded levis and patched plaid shirt

  then im practically healthy
randle croaked painfully

  thats all i could find wrong
murmured the oldster and when
placid parker looks for somethin he
finds it

  twoll take yore one randall said
huskily with all the humor he could
muster under the circumstances you
wasnt searchin for this jail

  well now gulped placid softly
mebbe i was its one way o findin
what im after

  why dont yuh look under yore
cot murmured randle it might be
there

  he sank back through sheer weak-
ness bitterly he thought he knew
why he was in jail after that foul
punch shang ringo had hauled him
to the marshal for investigation well
clem cottles would find out what
other bounty hunters had exactly
nothing but it would take time to
send to wyoming for particulars

  he must get out of here if he
didnt he would lose the rocking r
the inspector for the government
homesteaders was due in thre weeks
more improvement on his spread must
be shown or the grant would be taken
from him he was grimly resolved to
hold it now-to live down the name
that had followed him over long and
far trails he must get loose to put up
the fence or a dot cattle would de-
stroy his watering holes that would
mean ruin completely and god alone
knew what was happening to his stock
and winter hay

  groaning with the exertion he sat
up again nausea swept him but he
fought it down and rose unsteadily to
his feet

  placid parkers voice came warn-
ingly

  easy son or yuhll have one of
them ribs shovin through a lung if
that happens yuhll never face a
judge

 what for a judge demanded
randle

  from the looks o that hombre in
the next pew yuhll face murder
charges the oldster said blandly

  the young nester peered through
the bars into the gloom of the next
cell shang ringo lay full length on
the little cot his face a bloody pulp
an ugly lump behind his torn ear

  randle gasped with incredulity i
didnt do that hell last i remember
he kicked me in-

  the brisket put in placid mar-
shal cottles told me all about it cussed
plenty because he wasnt in on it
yuhre both up for disturbin the
peace

  a gusty sigh shook the nester if
renegade payoff



thats all ill pay my fine an get out

   taint that easy stated parker
glumly lodge pole runs one o them
phony juzgados marshal gets paid ac-
cordin to the amount he takes from
the men he arrests the longer he can
keep yuh the more board he can make
yuh pay somethin tells me yuh aint

 parker chuckled thats right

these calabooses that makes the mar-
shal earn his livin thisaway the town
dont pay him nothin he gets his
from chargin them that break the law
five dollars a day for beddin in his
jail hell he built this stone jug his-
self yuhll only get one meal too
thats why cottles is so fussy about
yuh fightin without him there to pole-
ax yuh all i did to rate me this jug-
gin was to get some likker down the
wrong pipe and cough too loud i
been here ten days gawd knows when
ill get out

  wearily randle sat down his lips
drew into bitter lines he had his
total wealth in his pockets fifty dol-
lars with which he had meant to pur-
chase the much needed wire for fence
if cottles kept him here for ten
days-

  yet it didnt matter much he was
a beaten man the secret he was try-
ing to bury had risen to taunt him
again eyes would stare at him now
fingers point him out as the brother of
red mcvey he was an outcast in
this great western empire he had
grown to love

  he conjured up the scorn in virge
addisons eyes when she found this
all out those eyes would reproach
him and piling on top of all this he
was a nester-despised by the big
ranchers of the valley

 thus he ached through the night
and until the sun was well up the
first sign of animation from the mar-
shals office came with the grumbling

of a sleepy voice answering the sharp
knock on the jail door

  randle and placid parker heard a
feminine voice lifted

  ive come to get them out mar-
shal virges voice came to them

  randle dropped back onto his cot
he didnt want her to do anything for
him he wanted to work out his own
salvation already the thought of
flight was building in his mind some-
where somehow he would find a place
where the name of mcvey was not
known

  the marshal and the girl came into
the corridor of the jail shang ringo
was at the door of his cell now blink-
ing his aching eyes sheepishly virge
faced him arms akimbo

  i should let you rot here she said
hotly when father took sick i gave
you orders not to fight with the men
or get the a dot into trouble youve
made a poor mess of both im getting
you out-but youre fired i wont tol-
erate anyone going against orders

  grumbling cottles opened the door
ringo stepped into the aisle swung to
the nester

  you his voice shook furiously
meddlin with you and exposin yuh
for what yuh are has got my job but
ill square it with yuh if its the last
thing i do no damn renegade can
make a fool uh me and he stamped
noisily out

hen cottles opened the nest-
ers door placid parker tried
to squirm out

  no yuh dont growled the law-
man shoving him roughly back yuh
stay till yuh pay

  but i aint got money pleaded
placid

  then ill find work for yuh clean-
in out stables snapped the lawman

  virge came toward randle he did
not look up at her he could feel the
tautness of her lithe body

  renegade she murmured softly

  he looked at her now his eyes wip-
try and bleak thats what they all

say he muttered yuh shouldnt be-
lieve different

  if you told me different- she be-
gan

  he shook his head the names
mcvey jess mcvey think what
yuh vant-yuh always have

  something seemed to go out of her
and her shoulders slumped

  then theres only one piece of ad-
vice i can give you she said her
voice trembling renegade-get out
your kind arent wanted in big tim-
ber

  hurt stabbed randle cruelly yuh
should leave me here he charged
harshly behind these walls

  im only doing this to teach shang
a lesson she countered quaveringly

  then she spun away her shoulders
shaking as tight sobs escaped her

cottles gazed after her curiously
shook his head

  cmon mcvey he said get to
hell out or ill charge yuh for another
days board

  dazedly randle strode from the
cell

  good luck pardrier placid called
after him

  in the front office the young nester
paused in the doorway from there he
could see the towering pinnacles of
smoky buttes and the serrated out-
lines of the farthermost peaks the
buttes meant home that jagged hori-
zon meant a new land and escape-
temporarily-from the burden ringos
charges had placed upon him slcwly
he pulled from his pocket the roll of
bills he had intended for the fence

  parkers fine he clipped tersely
turn him loose i aint needin this

         chapter iii
         longrider guns

  randle slogging
up the street to where
his horse had been left
was conscious of the
lodge pole townspeople
pointing him out heads
 turned and whispers were
 passed lips screwed
scornfnlly it was plainly-renegade
move on

   jess randle was-jess mcvey out-
 law renegade even the youngsters
 made fun of him threw sticks and
 stones at him he was truly an out-
 cast in lodge pole-everywhere it
 hurt deeply

   he drew freer breath when he loped
 clear of the town but he found no
 ease for his mental torture dejectedly
 he rode shoulders slumped head
 bowed-prey to body pains and the
  bleeding hurts of his soul

   the helpless tremulous way virge
 had told him to ride from the valley
 struck an odd note in his bitter
 thoughts angry she would have or-
 dered him out in no uncertain terms
 but there had been sadness in her
 voice and she had burst into tears at
 leaving him was it just pity for him

   he could find no other reason for
 her outburst of weeping he could
 not even imagine that it might have
 been her grief over finding out that
 the man she loved had been hiding
 under a false name cloaking his true
 identity and-the owlhoot brand

   he could only figure that she was
 ashamed of knowing him that she
 was angry with herself for becoming
 even remotely interested in him-red
 mcveys brother sent here to spy out
 the land for the notorious red button
 gang

   when he reached the talus of the
 sheep blues a great longing swept
 over him behind the up-rearing
 buttrs was home-the first he had
 known since his mother had passed
 on to the valhalla of frontier women
renegade payoff



and he and red had been left alone to
battle out their differences

  the hardships he had endured build-
ing that home of his paraded before
his mind he saw himself again com-
ing into this fecund valley to stake a
homestead claim the care he had
exercised in selecting his thirty breed-
ers the hoarding of his money to buy
more the stacking of winter feed
the short visits of virge it was all
gone now

  it was like being buried alive to
turn his back on the one bit of happi-
ness he had known a ravenous desire
to have more of that happiness shook
him rocked him until he was wheel-
ing his horse unconsciously back to-
ward the buttes and to him came a
grim resolve to hang on to fight this
stigma to gain peace for his seared
soul

  but as he roared around the buttes
and into his ranch yard a savage cry
ripped from his throat placid parker
sat among the ashes of his cabin in
the feed lot his winter stacks were
black rings against the brown earth
the rocking r had been torched to
the ground

  ignoring the drifter randle got
from his horse like an automaton
peered about everything he owned
was gone house feed cattle shang
ringo had made good his vengeance
vows randle cursed himself for not
coming directly here from the jail
but it was too late now

  shangs tracks would still be warm
though he wouldnt have much of a
start the lust to track down this
a dot cruelster and face him through
gunsmoke became a living raging
flame within jess randle he turned
to his horse

  no use goin nowhere placid
stated cryptically yore home is
here

  as if seeing the oldster for the first
time randle swung to him

  was he corrected bitterly my
homes where its always been-on the
trail but this time im not runnin

to dodge the handle of a renegade
im out to be one full stamped an
double cinched ive got a man to
kill

  placid stood up kicked the dust
shore now he scoffed killin wont
do no good and buckin the gamed
only find yuh a grave in some law-
dogs boothill look around fore yuh
go off half-cocked younker

  i dont savvy yuh randle bit out
yuhre blamin all this on one man
by yore talk said parker evenly
take a good look at the tracks there
was ten in the wipeout bunch and
does this tell yuh anything

  he pointed to a red button fastened
to a stick stuck in the ground

  with a curse jess randle hunkered
down by that telltale sign he had seen
it many times before had run from it
all his life it was the marker of red
mcvey master outlaw the arrogant
longrider whose vanity made him
leave marks of his cunning and de-
struction at the scenes of his crimes
red mcvey had shifted activities to
montana-big timber valley

slowly randle straightened his
eyes were bleak blue as chips of
glacial ice frost dripped from his
voice as he muttered 

  red mcvey and his nine hellions
the signs plain for a moment he
looked narrowly at parker and ida
killed shang ringo for this mebbe he
had a hand in it now instead of one
man to grease my guns for-ive got-
eleven

  the oldster saw deadliness in the
youngsters eyes many times before
during the chores to which he devoted
his life he had seen these same killer
lights come into the eyes of men it
was not pretty to see

  alone yuh aint got a chance he
cautioned sagely you paid my way
outa that jail and thereby got yore-
self a hand placid parker pays his
honest debt with interest ill work
out them wages any way yuh see fit
randle shook his head no when


thrilling adventures

i paid yore fine i never expected yuh
to be beholdin to me yuhre free to
ride wherever yuh like ive got
chores to do alone mebbe you dont
understand his voice grew vehe-
ment ive run from hell to break-
fast tryin to escape the name of mc-
vey and its rep always its caught up
with me yuhre the only man i ever
told this to but red mcvey is my
half-brother on my stepfathers side
the son of him and my mother she
always begged me to look out for red
but it was too much of a job we
fought when i tried to make him go
straight but he was born crooked-
like his father a tinhorn who killed
my mother i killed him for it and
red well-ive taken the blame for a
lot of his work i did a year at hard
labor in yuma on his account he
framed me and hung a job on me hes
followed me up and down the country
lookin for a chance to devil me he
knows i gunned his dad for good rea-
sons but he hates me like poison

  i didnt expect him to find me here
and he wouldnt have if shang ringo
hadnt checked me up an it got
around i was exonerated for killin
my stepdad ace mcvey and never
did another unlawful act in my life
but now im goin to from now on
any dirt thats thrown at my namell
be thrown by me his voice rose with
passion as he went on and my real
name is randle-my fathers name
mcvey adopted me tried to teach me
the tricks of his trade-black-leggin
with iced decks he-he-

  the lids came down over placids
pale eyes to cover what emotions
showed there sympathy for this bur-
dened youngster seethed within him
and out of it was born the understand-
ing of the range-bred

  i reckon i know how yuh feel son
he murmured softly placatingly and
when yuh bought me outa that cala-
boose yuh bought a gun hand both of
us together might pull the stingers
outa this mcvey bunch never had a
chance in hell for you-or me-to win

alone but yuh need rest yore ribs
need mendin an yore stummick can
stand some chow it looks flattern a
puncher caught in a stampede
grateful lights worked their way
through the hardness of young ran-
dles eyes but he shook his head
somberly

  i cant drag you into this placid
this is my personal chore

  parker grinned indifferently im
stickin like fleas on a leppyhe stated
flatly an mebbe when the smoke
clears away yuhll find yuh aint so
far outside the law as yuhre thinkin
were ridin the river from here on
out

  there was a distinct significance in
the oldsters words that passed over
randles troubled head warmth
flooded him for the loyal oldster and
his hand darted out they gripped
firmly

  yore name shouldnt be placid
randle told him it shoulda been
flypaper

  jest one of the many i use parker
remarked cryptically

three days of imbibing placid
parkers herb concoctions brought
new strength into jess randles body
the young nester helped erect a crude
little leanto for shelter he mended
quickly and on the fourth morning he
rose and snapped his muscles in
stretch placid grinned without a
word the youngsters hands darted to
his guns drew and fired the make-
shift kettle hanging over the fire
rolled clangingly to the ground

  whee-yeew gasped placid i
seen a jigger shoot like that onct
called hisself wild bill hickok he
was a huckleberry with cutters at
thirty yards

  randle grinned i can peel the
down off a duck pyrootin through a
tully bog with this pair of lead squir-
ters he said laughing i used to
start the home fires in the mornin
without gettin out of bed

  yuhll be tellin me next said
renegade payoff



placid dryly that yuh put the gun in
gunny

  randle ignored the harmless jibe
im ready to ride he announced
flatly

  placid nodded he had watched the
years pile upon this young nester in
the past four days and he had seen
the slow winding up of hate within
him like the coiling of a clock spring
that would never run down until its
task was finished

  placid parker was a good judge of
men he knew jess randle meant to
take the gunsmoke trail and keep it
until he or red mcvey was dead it
was peace going to war the law-abid-
ing yielding to the call of the owl-
hoot

  there were things the oldster
wanted to tell jess randle he wanted
to tell him of himself of his masquer-
ade but he couldnt he was too close
to a solution he had been after for
months to risk defeat now he had to
talk little walk light the men he fol-
lowed were cunning he had to play
his quiet game or lose the pot and
he wasnt going to lose

  ahorse once more randle surveyed
the remains of his shattered dreams

  i could of made it go here he said
passionately they wouldnt let me

  she aint a gonner yet placated
parker the harder the slap the bet-
ter it feels when it quits hurtin
thats why i always like to get the
bellyache feels so good when she
quits thisll be a real spread in four
years andyoull be roddin it

  randle shook his head morosely
jest another monument to my fail-
ure he said and then they were
wheeling to the drum of madly racing
hoofs

  they had not gone far when virge
addison swept around the buttes
burning the trail a cry burst from her
lips at sight of them a cry that car-
ried no warmth just greeting under
duress she whirled up her eyes were
red-rimmed from crying her lips tight
with anger

  dads gone she cried out in
agony here and she thrust a
piece of paper at randle

  the young nester searched her face
for sign of friendliness there was
none she was all feminine fury and
scorn and grief her direct stare was
condemning he flinched at the stab of
her eyes absently he unfolded the
paper and let the scrawled note leap
at him puzzled he read the contents

a dot

  yore roundups almost in and there aint
enough prime beef left for us to take so
were takin the biggest steer on the place
kim addison we figger his tough old car-
cass is worth five thousand to you send

the old mans sickness croaked him which

muy pronto

   this shore beats rustling cow critters all

  and at the bottom was a crudely
drawn button done in red crayon-the
sign of red mcvey

  mcvey the name tore from ran-
dles throat

  your brother said virge scorn-
fully i wish id left you rot in jail
tears welled unbidden to her dark
eyes

  a flood of anger engulfed jess ran-
dle quit actin up he commanded
hotly tell me what happened quick
miss addison

the sharpness of his tone brought
a rush of crimson to her face

you cant snarl at me like that
jess randle she stormed i wont-

  he grabbed her roughly by the
shoulders shook her till her teeth rat-
tled

  no time for kid stuff virge he
shouted tell me all yuh know that

s prompt action sobered
virge instantly her
shoulders slumped

  the boys are all out
at roundup she said her
voice trembling shang
came back and tried to
talk me into giving him
his old job again i would have if he
hadnt got fresh and tried to paw me
i struck him and he left swearing to
hurt me some way i took a ride out
to see how the work was coming
when i returned dad was gone that
note was pinned to the door thats
all i know

  thats enough gritted randle
shangs mixed up in this i had a
hunch he wasnt tellin the truth about
sendin to wyomin for my record
he was in touch with my brother-
thats what hed already told red i
was here thats how i came to get
torched out red wouldnt miss a
chance to devil me he hates me an
i hate him shangs responsible for
all this figgerin to make me run
well he didnt succeed damn his-
he ended with a snap of his lean jaws

  virges lips curled pretty talk
she charged made to protect your-
self and your brother you brought
mcvey here you plotted this kid-
naping of my father heres the
money she tossed the package onto
the ground shang might be wild
but he isnt a renegade-like you
now go release my father

  randle leaped from his horse
scooped up the money and thrust it
back into the crook of her arm

  go on home he clipped bitterly
ill get kim back

  she looked at him queerly if you
think you can crawl out of this-
she began lamely

  shut up he gritted ruthlessly
though he knew he never wanted to
see her go but their paths were sep-
arated forever now

  gently he slapped the flank of her
pony sent it loping back toward the
a dot he looked after her longing
in his eyes pulse hammering he
jerked his eyes away from her and
lifted his reins swung to his horse
and reseated his guns

  loves one thing muttered placid
grimly but facin that gang alone is
somethin else

  but like love randle said hotly
itll be a pleasure you read the note
one man was to come it said they
can see anybody else from their hide-
out i go alone

  then he was hitting a high lope for
the sheep blues and totem pole peak
parkers shout was unintelligible he
didnt see the oldster take off in a
wide circle to follow

  nor did he want to look back again
toward those blackened ruins it hurt
too deeply he had seen that home for
the last time and now his back
turned upon it he gulped in the pun-
gent air determined that if he lived
through the chore facing him at
totem pole peak he would ride on
never to return to the big timber

  he was sealing his fate in this one
great struggle that virge might at
least think kindly of him in memory
the one thing he yearned to do before
leaving was to prove to her alone that
he was not the renegade she thought
him if dying would do that he was
willing first he must erase the
stigma attached to him by red mc-
vey he had done his best with red
for his mothers sake now the right
thing was to stop the ruthless rene-
gade and his hellions for once and for
all to wipe away their preyings upon
society he knew their mother would
rather see red dead than allowed to
continue his crimes but he found it
hard to face his blood kin through
gunsmoke

  jess randle knew that a man must
have the legality of a law badge to
justify the killing of even a renegade
this meant the owlhoot trail for him
-dim trails swift rides shadowy
renegade payoff



coverts the cries of bounty hunters
well it had happened before would
happen again he was but one of many
men using the moon for a sun through
circumstances

  as randle wound up the scabrous
slants of the sheep blues he was
aware of a definite chill in the air a
storm was brewing over the jagged
peaks thunderheads were shoving
their frayed cones into the ominous
sky already totem pole peak was
capped with dense rain clouds light-
ning forked there thunder pealed out
crashingly

  randle pulled his bandanna tighter
about his throat his lips grew firmer
muscles tighter as he neared totem
pole the tall pinnacle sawtoothed
into the clouds somewhere up there
were red mcvey and his red but-
tons

  at the base of the peak he dis-
mounted blew on his chilled hands to
warm them every faculty must be on
the alert now every muscle limber
and ready the odds confronting him
were almost overwhelming but this
was showdown he didnt care how
many men he faced so long as one of
them was red mcvey tle was like a
man going to death knew it and he
was unafraid he was glad the world
held little for him now

  he stiffened but did not turn as the
sound of a scraping boot came from
behind him he waited for the voice
he knew would come cracked at him
over gun barrels the faint smell of
a cigarette floated to him from behind
the boulder just to his right rear
then the voice

  you the a dot jigger with the
cash the renegade behind the rock
demanded

  only then did jess randle turn
slowly thumbs hooked in his belts
the man stood beside the boulder his
swart brutal face lined with threat
one of reds ten red buttons his
spade chin was thrust out belligerently
his horny fists clutched two guns un-
waveringly

  im yore huckleberry randle said
easily wheres kim addison

  greed was in the outlaws eyes he
jerked his head up the slants but his
eyes and guns never left randle

  after you he cracked out gruffly

  with cold tides tingling his spine
jess randle stepped in the direction
indicated as he brushed close to the
man he whirled with catlike agility
his right gun leaped from leather shot
up and arced down its barrel cracked
sickeningly on the outlaws skull his
face was suffused with surprise then
pain as he fell unconscious it was a
beautiful exhibition of timing perfect
coordination between randles mind
and muscles executed with as least
sound as possible a shot would have
warned red mcvey

  he ducked up the trail palming his
left gun he must get to kim addison
before the alarm was spread they
would kill him at the first sign of
trouble the narrow path turned
sharply into an arroyo then a sharp
voice set him back on his heels he
whirled to see a man standing beside
a clump of laurel

  what the hell yuh runnin fer
waco the man called why-hey

jess triggered as the mans guns
came up echoes rolled flatly over
the hills blood curtained the out-
laws face as he crumpled and rolled
down the slope his jaws clamped
tight now randle went on this was
it every right feeling he had ever
possessed was dead within him in its
place was a lust to slay and keep on
killing until this whole gang was
wiped out or he was dead he was a
machine of destruction honing to col-
lect in full for all the hurts and bur-
dens heaped upon his shoulders by
this band of renegades and their dia-
bolical he-coon

  as he surged on the arroyo opened
out in front of him in tight against
the slant hugged a tiny leanto a yell
broke from his lips as two men jumped
from within it and also spraddled old


thrilling adventures

kim addison who lay trussed against
the side of the hovel flame and lead
streaked out at him and then his guns
were bucking in his hands the two
renegades pitched and swayed writh-
ing down before even surprise could
register on their lustful murderous
faces

  the swiftness of the nesters attack
was working for him but he had
reached the end of that lethal slugs
tore at him from renegade coverts as
the red buttons posted about the
arroyo cut loose one smashed burn-
ingly through the calf of hds leg he
went down to one knee but kept trig-
gering savagery forced him erect
and like a man geared to run the
gauntlet of hell he charged toward
old kim in a desperate effort to pro-
tect him as he reached the silver-
haired range baron he recognized
reds voice above the crescending
clamor

  its jess his brother yelled
get the white-livered son and he
threw up his guns

  but before red mcvey could shoot
the flat dry clap of shots from an-
other quarter claimed his attention
all eyes focused up the arroyo leap-
ing his horse shooting came placid
parker his voice lifted in shrieking
crescendo

  come get em boys the rats are
in a trap 

  posse screamed a renegade and
headed for a rocky covert

  the rest took flight in a frenzied
scramble randles guns roared at
their backs quick questions flooding
his mind how had parker got here
who were the men with him

  but he didnt stop to look as he
bent down over kirn addison the
storm broke over the sheep blues
stinging rain slanted down and blue
lightning etched the ominous tum-
bling skies with silver lances of bright
flame

  who the hell are you blustered
the rancher as randle fingered the
knots of his bonds

  what difference does it make
randle said coldly yuhre goin

home

  this was the first time he had ever
met old kim face to face but there
was profound gratitude in the old-
sters eyes as he searched the hard
young visage before him then parker
leaped beside them produced a bar-
low that cut the a dot owners thongs

  wheres the posse randle de-
manded looking about

  placid chuckled im it he
croaked hell that trick i jest
pulled is old but always new spe-
cially when yuhre dealin with men
dodgin the law theyre all alike
when it comes to facin lawdog gun-

  theyll be cornin back gritted

  like a burnt calf with the piggin
strings pulled the rancher said with
a weak grin

yells and renegade lead slam-
ming away they ran through the
rain jess randle had marveled at
the speed of the two oldsters running
with him but he knew that lead prod-
ding a mans tailbone makes even the
clumsy travel fast the cries of the
red buttons came to them through
thunder and gunsounds he thanked
nature for the storm which was par-
tially covering their retreat

  with death dogging their heels
they made it through renegade lead to
where randle had left his horse ad-
dison gave out at that point his ill-
ness dug the grit from his old body
and fatigue had its way he slumped
to the muddy ground in a pitiful sod-
den huddle

  go on he said huskily my old
hide aint worth the hole yuhd put
it in come back later and pat me
with a spade

he had slipped around
them and stood beside a
boulder just down trail
his tall angular frame
was crouched and he was ready to
fire murder was in his smoky blue
eyes in his snarl

 the starch flowed from randle as
he looked at the man he hated he
had been on the verge of triumph
only to have it snatched from his
grasp by this ruthless renegade
brother bitterness shook him to the
soul at every turn his half-brother
had whipped him hounded him and
now he was gloating red mcvey
was at last going to end that misery
for all time jess randle knew his
last breath would be drawn here but
his courage did not desert him

 put down yore guns red he said
slowly ill give you yore needins
the renegade chuckled mirthlessly
that last time was plenty jess he
drawled you always was my betters

the storm unleashed its fury like
the pent up drums of doom rain beat

down in mocking rhythm the killer
lights in reds eyes deepened

 a choking cry from kim addison
stayed red mcveys triggers the a
dot owners hand was pointing shak-
ily down into the valley below all
eyes followed its direction the
lightning-stabbed vista tore gasps
from every mans throat

 in the narrow causeway between
totem pole peak and bear claw
point where the valley toed the moun-
tains was a lone rider there was
no mistaking her-virge addison
riding through the storm she was
coming with the money to liberate her
father the wind was sweeping down
from the hills and away from her
she couldnt have heard the ominous
sounds behind her but running shoul-
der to shoulder was a dark mass of
living destruction stampede

  randle saw it all at a glance the
storm had got in its dread work at
the big timber roundup and the
punchers had been unable to hold the
last of the a dot cattle in a solid
mass of clashing horns several thou-
sand head of maddened steers were
bearing down upon the unsuspecting
girl

 good gawd sobbed old addison
and buried his face in his hands

 theyll tromp her into the mud
shore cried placid

 jess randle spun to his brother
shoot an be damned to yuh he
shouted im goin after her

 a strange look leaped into reds
bloodshot eyes as randle vaulted
into his saddle then jess randle
was roaring dovn the trail his back
crawled as he expected each instant
to feel the snag of lead through him
but instead he heard the clatter of
hoofs behind him he screwed around
in his kak red mcvey and shang
ringo were riding like centaurs down
the tricky slants

 but grimly he detached himself
from all thoughts of them all he
could see was virge addison the girl
he loved riding along ignorant of the


thrilling adventures

fact that death was bearing down
upon her the almost steady roll of
thunder blotted out the pound of the
death-dealing hoofs if she would
only look back

  but virge addison was intent upon
only one thing-totem pole peak
her shoulders were hunched against
the storm head drawn down and
randle saw that the chances of saving
her were slight but he could at least
die with her in his arms

  he drove his horse over low rocks
and brush slipping sliding in the
muck racing on to certain destruc-
tion and then suddenly-out of the
maelstrom of his thoughts-came the
realization that red was not chasing
him red and shang were bent on
the same mission that drove him reck-
lessly toward doom brothers were
siding each other in this grim race
with death outlawry had been dis-
carded and manhood-his mothers
heritage to him-had shown through
the hard veneer of red mcvey

  understanding shook him as he
twisted his head for a glimpse of red
the renegades lips were creased into
tight lines-a smile that only death
could stamp on a mans lips and
there was a strange light in his eyes
red mcvey didnt look the killer
now something fine was in his face

  ringos teeth were bared in a bellig-
erent snarl typical of the rough and
tumble artist who did all things with
a curse on his lips he too was rid-
ing as he had never ridden before
and randle knew-men will kill men
but men will die willingly to preserve
the life of a good woman real men
these two

  it was a paradox to randle-red
mcvey and shang ringo siding him
it was a thousand to one chance that
they would die yet each had one
goal-virge addison randle could
see shangs motive he too igved the
girl but reds reason puzzled him

  a quarter of a mile still separated
them from virge three hundred
yards behind her raced the stamped-

ing cattle straight for her blind
panic urging them on randles heart
seemed to have lodged in his throat
he couldnt make it in time

  he groaned as he saw virge sud-
denly become aware of her predica-
ment madly she drove her spurs
deep her pony took fright reared
then like a coiled spring it bolted
throwing her in a pitiful huddle on
the ground

  sobbing in his anguish jess randle
prayed in his horses ears he saw
there was only one way to pick her
up that was to quit his horse and
there wouldnt be a chance to win out
then he was aware of red racing be-
side him and that they were squarely
in the path of the stampeding jugger-
naut

  ride on through jess red
yelled we cant turn the trick

  yellow after all randle thought
scornfully he raced on determinedly
leaped down beside the girl she was
unconscious

as he bent down red and shang
went past him cradling virge
in his arms he gauged the distance be-
tween them and the writhing mass of
horns and hoofs he groaned it
would be all over in a minute not
fifty yards separated them useless
to attempt to escape it would only
prolong their death beneath those
grinding hoofs thank god virge
would never know what struck her

  the thunder of that living hell was
roaring above the storm he could
see the lolling red tongues of the
stampede leaders lightning cast a
blue glow from their long clashing
horns their eyes were distended in
panic

  only the range-bred can know the
awfulness of a stampede the terrible
flight of storm-maddened cattle the
picture of virges cruelly pounded
body sickened randle he sank down
with her cradled in his arms his eyes
closed against the avalanche that
shook the ground under him
renegade payoff



  suddenly he was aware of a new
note injected into the hideous sounds
-the shouts of men the crack of
pistols his eyes flew open what he
saw sent surprise and admiration
coursing through him wildly a
strangled shout tore from his own
throat

  red mcvey and shang ringo were
battling the leaders of the stampede
in a reckless effort to turn the brown
tide fascinated randle watched the
brave play like knights astride fear-
less charges the two were knifing into
the foremost of the herd driving their
horses shoulder against shoulder
shooting killing shouting

  that could not last no man or

live he did not see that awful tide
pouring past him in two streams but
twenty feet away lay the barrier that
had saved his and virges lives-
grotesque forms huddled at the under
edge of a tangled mangled mass he
sav that through a stinging mist that
burned his eyes like molten lead

 he stood up waving his arms
shouting his legs straddling virge
until the twin streams roared past he
kept the maddened brutes from break-
ing out of line and trampling them
then he was running toward the piti-
ful huddles that had once been his
enemies tears streaked his face all
the hatred and bitterness of his soul
was gone now the sacrifice of red

horse could buck that stampede for
long and survive but there was a
vague chance that the cattle could be
turned slightly enough to chouse
them past the prayer in randles
heart was wild and earnest

  then the front line of the herd
erupted in horseflesh men and squeal-
ing animals in a welter of hoofs and
bodies red and shang went down
over the dam made by the two cattle
piled up in a wall that split the rest

  jess randle was crying now un-
ashamed red    there were ties
between them that he had never sus-
pected and red had given his life
that he and the girl he loved might

and shang had been great supreme
he couldnt hate them now

 he fell to his knees beside his
brother

 red why-why he cried

  the bundle of mangled flesh twisted
heaved and randle lifted reds bat-
tered head to his lap reds eyes flut-
tered open managed to focus rain
pelted his face washed away the
blood left it pallid as death itself
but he smiled

  we made it he choked and blood
bubbled to his lips yuhre a man
jess better bigger finern me or
shang all these years i been honin
to trim yore horns but when i lined


thrilling adventures

on yore back as yuh forked up to go
after miss addison i knowed i
couldnt do it his voice broke and
came again in gasps dont ever run
again kid were square this is my
payoff for all the hate and trouble
ive caused you so long-pard-
and he died a set little smile on his
battered lips

 red mcvey renegade man in-
stead of finding a shallow grave such
as marked many a longriders trail he
found peace and the knowledge that
he died doing one honorable thing
jess randles stout frame shook with
sobs

  then he crouched at shangs side
the flame of life guttered faintly
within the a dots ex-ramrod he
mumbled through a bloody foam un-
conscious that anyone was near

  dyin    goin like a man anyhow
   she never did love me shoulda
knowed that well shes fixed  
and his inane talk was stilled by
death

ick at the sight of the carnage
weak from the loss of blood jess
randle sank into unconsciousness  

  the cold rain beating on randles
face brought him to he opened his
eyes and gazed into the faces of placid
parker old kim addison and several
a dot punchers who had been follow-
ing the stampeding herd

 virge-how is she he asked
hoarsely

  jarred up a bit son addison an-
swered but mighty all right

  placids chuckle drew randles eyes
to him

  blockin that stampede was a sight
fittin to see he said glowing never
in hell was there three braver men
jess i reckon yuh can go back to
homesteadin now and have folks look
up instead of down at yuh

 what had happened in these stir-
ring hours came poignantly to randle
he shook his head youre for genin
i gunned three men parker the lawll
make me answer for that

  yuhre a dang fool said placid
parker if yore ears was drier yuhda
heard me deputizin yuh when yuh
took off up the totem pole trail i
hollered after yuh but yuh paid no
more heedn a ceegar store injun
hell yuh was a lawdlog all the time

vey he put me in yore cell sos i
could lcinda quiz yuh he reached
inside his shirt and heres the fifty
pesos back yuh paid my way out
with

  randle stared at him incredulously
kim addison chuckled

  jess grat dawson lawdog of the
pinkerton agency is handin yuh
fifty dollars take it placid parker
is jest one of the many names he uses
when hes trailin longloopers its his
way of doin business

  then virge swooped down on ran-
dle before he could open his mouth

son said the lawman eyes twinkling
that he could go back to homestead-
in

  virges cheeks took on new color as
she said shyly

  well i-im ready any time he

  and jess randles arms found her
a warm tremor replaced the chill that
had gripped him

  ive only got fifty dollars as a
starter he murmured weakly

  fifty dollars and a woman thats
willing to help you jess she
breathed softly

  old kim nudged placid and nodded
to his punchers all turned away but
couldnt resist the temptation of
glancing over their shoulders what
they saw brought knowing smiles
jess randles burdens were gone and
the warmth of love was his

houssa
command
houssa command



those who whisper words of evil into
the ears of the noble chiefs of the
ochori the ochori have begun the
dance-of-many-days that means
many spears and-much trouble

  a mocking light came into hartlys
blue eyes of course you understand
that i mean trouble for them not for
us here

  one or two of the men in the line
barely nodded they understood just
what their commanding officer meant
jungle drums-the primitive telegraph
of the congo-would carry word back
to the ochori that the officer in charge
of the troops of the commissioner
knew what was going on and was dis-
pleased

  that is all said hartly dis-
missed 

ade hartly lieutenant of
the st royal hertford regi-
ment now commanding officer of the
th regiment of houssas turned and
strolled back to his quarters

  he halted as he saw the white man
who was lounging in the hammock on
the mosquito-netted porch hartlys
first impression was that a very large
and grimy hog dressed in dirty khaki
shirt and shorts had moved in on him

  the porcine-like individual re-
garded hartly with eyes that were
very bright and cold and then man-
aged to sit upright his fat legs hang-
ing over the side of the hammock the
effect was very much like a pig rising
out of a wallow

  hot the man said in a voice
that was surprisingly soft beastly
weather

  quite said hartly hadnt the
slightest idea i had a visitor im
hartly

  of the houssas said the big man
sorry i couldnt quite hear your ad-
dress to the men looked impressive
from here he smiled revealing sur-
prisingly white and even teeth broc-
ton is my name carl brocton

  hartly eyed the holstered luger
automatic hanging from broctons

belt it was not what might be con-
sidered a reassuring addition to the
big mans attire there had been
rumors of a white man stirring up the
natives brocton looked capable of
brewing a nasty broth of trouble if he
put his mind to it

  cooler inside said hartly will
you have a drink

 thanks brocton followed him
into the bungalow managed to get
some of the ochori to bring me down
river this morning in a canoe
ochori hartly frowned as he
produced bottle and glasses sur-
prising theyd bring you they havent
been very friendly toward the whites
in this district of late

  i had no trouble brocton watched
as hartly pijured the liquor into his
glass thats fine thanks he sank
into a chair and it creaked beneath his
weight heard the drums off in the
hills when i was coming down the
river-wondered if there might be
something going on

  nothing yet said hartly but its
always wise to be ready

  brocton nodded and sniffed at his
glass suddenly he amazed hartly by
raising a dissuading hand

  what the devils the matter de-
manded hartly lowering his glass un-
tasted

  a very distinct odor of burnt al-
monds said brocton as coolly as
though he were complimenting the
aroma of an aged brandy potassium
cyanide he shook his big head
looks like someone doesnt like you
hartly

  hartly got slowly to his feet his
blue eyes were fixed intently on the
grimy face of the big man very de-
liberately he reached out opened a
drawer of a desk and pulled out an
automatic he dropped the gun into
his pocket

  hardly a native poison he said
if you-

 now now brocton spoke like a
father soothing a child you forget
that i wouldnt let you drink it
loo

thrilling adventures

   hartly nodded his eyes were still
 watching brocton the big man puz-
 zled him brocton had certainly done
 him a good turn yet-

   wonder if i might wash up a bit
 said brocton

   certainly hartly smiled hope
 you dont mind my saying so but it
 would do no harm he nodded toward
 the hall second door on your left
 a bit primitive but plenty of soap
 and water

   thanks carl broctons lumber-
 ing bulk disappeared into the hall

   hartly stepped out onto the porch
 his orderly leaped up from where he
 had been dozing in the shade of a
 palm hartly spoke swiftly and softly
 the native nodded

   it shall be done bwana he said
 and hurried away

   wade hartly turned suddenly hear-
 ing voices his eyes narrowed as he
 saw the procession that had entered
 the compound-a tall thin white man
 followed by a group of native porters

  was approaching

   this appears to be vistors day
 muttered hartly he smiled but the
 blue eyes were hard

   all at once he heard broctons step
 behind him felt the hard barrel of an
 automatic pressing against his spine

   i have been here for the past two
 days brocton said quickly in his ear
 you know me quite well one good
 turn deserves another you under-
 stand

   just as you wish said hartly
 quietly but id put the gun away it
 might be dangerous for you

  why demanded brocton

   take a look to your left

   the big man glanced to his left a
 native sat in an open window of the
 bungalow covering brocton with a
 rifle hartlys orderly had obeyed his
 orders

 good said brocton calmly plac-
 ing his automatic back into his holster
 and stepping beside hartly hoped
 you werent quite that much of a fool
 hartly glanced at the big man broc-

 ton was so scrubbed and shining that
 he looked like the prize-winning hog
 at a county fair

  the third white man had crossed
the compound with his natives behind
him hartly saw that they were not
ochori but from one of the other
river tribes the man was dark-haired
with hard eyes and a lean wolf-like
look

  lieutenant hartly he asked with
a swift glance at the commanding offi-
cer of the houssas and an equally
swift glance at brocton i am perry
lorain

  wanted by the police of three con-
tinents said brocton softly but not
so low that perry lorain did not hear
him

  hartly looked at the sun in half
an hour it would be night and with it
would come danger not that he felt
he was exactly at a pink tea at the mo-
ment both brocton and lorain
looked dangerous-damn dangerous
just what either of them had to do
with the uprising of the ochori he did
not know as yet

in a moments silence he dimly
heard the distant throbbing of the
drums back in the hills his spine
prickled he sensed trouble in the
sound his houssas knew it as well as
he did he noticed that they had
quietly moved into strategic positions
so that they were ready for any un-
expected moves upon the part of
perry lorain and the twenty natives
he had brought with him

  mind telling me why you are
here hartly looked at lorain

  of course not said the dark-
haired man i am very anxious to
see the commissioner if you will tell
him i have arrived

  front boy said brocton softly
and ironically

  sorry hartly ignored the big
man but mr slade is not here at
present he has gone back to england
on leave he looked steadily at
lorain im acting commissioner if
houssa command



there is anything that i can do for
you

  you know this man well lorain
nodded toward carl brocton

  yes rather said hartly hes
been here for the past two days
brocton smiled and looked very
pleased with the world in general

  then of course it would be foolish
for me to suspect him said lorain
with a shrug of his shoulders

  suspect him of what demanded
hartly

  of stealing my money belt contain-
ing five thousand dollars said lorain
it was taken last night while i
camped farther up the river

  my dear man exclaimed brocton
in shocked surprise you mean to
say that you camped along the river
without leaving any of your men on
guard

  two of my men were on guard
said lorain this morning i found
them both dead-murdered

  come in the house gentlemen
said hartly perhaps we had better
talk this thing over

  brocton and lorain followed him
into the bungalow hartly produced
three clean glasses and calmly poured
drinks from the bottle of poisoned
liquor brocton sat watching his big
face expressionless no movement no
word of protest came from him

  not for me thank you said lorain
quickly i never drink

  that chap we were talking about
hartly said brocton he might have
come on ahead arranged matters to
his satisfaction and then turned up
again later

  right hartly nodded playing
along with brocton it had grown dark
and he held a match to the wick of a
lamp the faces of the three men
loomed in the yellow glow

bad form for only two of us to
drink dont you think so brocton
absolutely said the big man
please dont let me stop you pro-
tested lorain you make me feel
guilty -

  do we said brocton staring at
him thoughtfully

suddenly from the blackness
came a scream of mortal agony
succeeded by the high-pitched babble
of native voices feet padded on the
steps of the porch a houssa soldier
loomed in the doorway

 they come bwana he cried
ochori-trouble pretty quick

 how many demanded hartly
calmly

  he didnt hear the answer guns
roared in the night and shrill native
yells rose above the sound brocton
sighed and got to his feet he drew
out his luger automatic and looked
at it

  guess thisll be of some use he
said

  hartly frowned and drew his own
gun how many of the ochori he
again demanded of the houssa

  many of them as many as-

  again the answer was cut off a
long spear came hurtling through a
window the native dropped heart-
pierced

  put out the lamp snapped lorain
a gun leaped into his hand he aimed
carefully at something outside the
window and fired youre nearest
hartly if you dont mind his casual
manner of speech was in strange con-
trast to the danger of the situation

  right hartly blew out the lamp
plunging the room of the bungalow
into darkness afraid were in for
quite a bit of a show

  if the natives all up and down the
river could be stirred up enough to
revolt against all the white men in the
congo said lorains voice out of the
darkness that would mean trouble
enough to keep a lot of soldiers busy
troops would have to be sent out from
the mother country and with the
european situation what it is that
wouldnt be so good would it

  right hartly fired ashe saw dark
forms moving toward the bungalow
two of them dropped hit by his first


thrilling adventures

and seconds shots it would be to the
interest of a powerful nation to hire a
man to deliberately stir up trouble
along the river

  it was a strangely nonchalant con-
versation that was thus carried on
amid gunfire

  if the ochori got away with it
that would be a temptation to the
other tribes to follow suit said broc-
ton chiming in from his place at a
window on the other side of the room
but if they didnt even get away with
this- his voice faded and he fired
again out of the window

hartly edged toward the door
then dropped down and crawled
across the porch the darkness hid
him he had decided that his place
was with his men brocton and lorain
could take care of themselves they
had shown that quite clearly

  like a moving shadow hartly went
down the steps the figure of a half-
naked native came hurtling toward
him hartly twisted to one side
raised the automatic in his right hand
there was the dull thud of steel
against bone and the ochori dropped

  hartly moved on worming his way
through a patch of brush toward the
barracks the sound of firing was loud
about him gun-flame licked at the
night figures moved about no
longer did the ochori yell they were
concentrating their attack on the bun-
galow and the barracks

  two natives loomed in front of
hartly so close that he clearly saw
them raise their spears for the death
thrust his automatic roared twice-
and then there was no longer anyone
blocking his path he went on run-
ning swiftly and reached a door of
the barracks

 let me in my children he
shouted it is your commanding offi-
cer

  a wooden bar was lifted and the
door opened hartly stepped inside
the door was slammed shut behind
him

  he sensed the feeling of relief that
swept over the houssas they were
all right now their commanding offi-
cer was with them he would know
what to do next hartly hoped that he
could live up to their expectations

  ten of you come with me he or-
dered crisply full marching equip-
ment and remember we must get away
from here without being seen

 worried muttering sounds came
from some of the rest of the men as
he heard it hartly sensed what was
in their minds

  drive the fear out of your hearts
said hartly in the native tongue do
not all of you know me well enough
to be sure that i will never desert
you it is because i have a big plan to
rid us of the attacking ochori that i
order ten men to come with me now
you must believe that it will be soon
that we will return i go to bring up
reinforcements - great reinforce-
ments

  we hear and believe bwana said
native voices out of the darkness as
you say it shall be

  that is as i wish it said hartly
with the coming of the morning sun
there will be a great fear in the hearts
of the ochori who have dared to at-
tack the barracks of the houssas this
night they will return to their vil-
lages like little children who are
frightened by the darkness-and there
will be peace in the land

  in the small hours before the dawn
ten men under the command of hartly
of the houssas made their way stealth-
ily out of the barracks they escaped
unseen beneath the barrage of rifle
fire laid down for them

  later as the first rays of morning
sunlight broke through the clouds
notiki one of the lesser chiefs of the
ochori watched from a brush-tangled
rise that overlooked a pass two miles
from the barracks of the houssas and
not far from the river

  notiki stood tall and straight a
giant native who wore no more than a
loin cloth and the ornaments befitting
houssa command



a man of his rank over him stole a
glow that was not caused by the warm
sunlight that broke through the clouds
bringing -with it the heat of another
day that glow was caused by exulta-
tion

  for was notiki not sure that the
warriors among his people had routed
the white lord and the houssas at the
barracks soon there would be no law
in the land save that of the ochori
and the other tribes

  and then notiki heard it from the
direction of the river it came the
clear notes of a bugle to the chief it
was as though the sound foretold the
end of the world he stood tensely
eyes fixed on the opening against the
jungle growth that was the lower end
of the pass

 a squad of houssas appeared
marching smartly in formation of
fours with a white officer stepping
briskly in the lead across the en-
trance of the pass they went and dis-
appeared behind them came a second
squad then another and another

  notiki stood there counting them
and as he counted he grew sick at
heart never had he realized that
there were so many of the houssas
for half an hour they continued pass-
ing fully five hundred of them he
counted and he realized that the white
officer who had gone on ahead was
marching them toward the barracks

  a great fear for the safety of his
own people swept over notiki he
must warn them of their danger-get
them away from the barracks before
that huge mass of reinforcements ar-
rived

  like a frightened deer he sped
through the forest and the brush run-
ning with fear licking at his heels he
reached the woods just beyond the
barracks and found that the ochori
were marshaling their forces for a
final attack a number of them had
died for the houssas in the barracks
and the two white men in the bunga-
low had battled valiantly all through
the long night

  hurriedly notiki told them what he
had seen and as his own people lis-
tened they too grew afraid like shad-
ows they drifted away to disappear
into the jungle and soon the post was
deserted

  theyve gone said brocton star-
ing out of a window with tired eyes
what the devil drove them away
i dont know lorain watched the
big man not for an instant during the
long night had these two dared en-
tirely to trust each other it might be
a trick of some sort wonder what be-
came of hartly

 probably commanding his men
from inside the barracks said broc-
ton the old fighting spirit like
hell the big man snorted deri-
sively

  from the east there came the sound
of a bugle the notes clear and sweet in
the silence of the warm morning
across the compound came a squad of
eight men and a native sergeant and
a bugler wade hartly of the houssas
marched smartly in the lead

  like hell did you say perry
lorain smiled mockingly at carl broc-
ton looks like you were right about
the old fighting spirit only eleven
men-and in some way they managed
to terrorize the ochori to such an ex-
tent that they all ran without even at-
tempting to fight

  yes said brocton somberly but
how

hartly halted and voiced a com-
mand the bugler raised his horn
to his lips and blew assembly out
of the barracks trotted the rest of tht
regiment of houssas falling swiftly
into line and standing at attention

  there will be no more trouble in
the river country o my children said
hartly no longer will the chiefs of
the ochori dare to lift their heads
when it is known among the other
people of the land that they have run

smiled a tired smile and they will
know there is still lav in the land
dismissed

  chattering delightedly the native
soldiers broke ranks eagerly ques-
tioning the ten men who had been
with hartly

  hartly walked toward the bungalow
the blue eyes in the lean tanned face
were hard and his right hand rested
on the butt of the automatic that hung
in a holster at his hip

brocton and lorain stepped out
onto the porch making an elab-
orate show of replacing their guns in
their holsters

  nicely done said brocton but
i still dont quite understand it what
happened hartly

  the ochori are a primitive peo-
ple said hartly as he dropped into
a chair they believe what they see
i was sure that they would have some
one watching the pass near the river-
there was always danger of a few more
soldiers coming to our aid from that
direction

  there was someone on watch
asked lorain as hartly paused

  yes i had one of my men scout
around before dawn to be sure after
that it was quite simple i merely
marched a squad of men past the open-
ing at the lower end of the pass then
had them sneak back out of sight and
march by again a bit monotonous
but from the distance it must have
looked like quite an impressive army
quite a trick brocton laughed
anyway you certainly stopped any
further idea of revolt among the na-
tives

  i hope so hartly abruptly drew
his gun and covered the big man
must be quite a disappointment to
you brocton

  what the devil do you mean
snarled carl brocton his eyes danger-
ous

  yesterday evening you said you
hoped that i was not quite a fool
hartly smiled im not really

  far from it said lorain quietly
always much smarter than i was at
school and all that his gun also cov-
ered the big man often usd to tell
you so didnt i wade

  yes but i never believed it hartly
smiled at brocton stirring up the
natives the way you have been doing
has been clever brocton but after all
stealing that money belt from lorain
was rather foolish it was a side issue
and conspirators like you should avoid
side issues i suppose the temptation
was too much for you but i presume
the temptation was purposely put in
your way right perry

  quite said lorain the money
is marked of course and sending a
man up as a thief is so much better
so much less chance of international
complications stealing five thousand
dollars and murdering two natives
he shook his head bad brocton
probably get you life in jail at the
least

  nice of you to make yourself at
home here like you did yesterday
said hartly watching the big man
you were watched from the moment
you arrived of course my orderly a
very unobtrusive sort of chap saw
you put the poison in the liquor bot-
tle of course

  but i warned you protested broc-
ton i didnt let you drink it

  i know hartly nodded solemnly
you planned it that way my life in
danger and you stepping in at the
right moment you knew that lorain
was headed this way and wanted me
to be on your side when he arrived if
you could convince me he was the
white man who had been stirring up
the trouble among the natives all the
better for you i must say the hints
you dropped were well done

  you might have believed him if id
been a stranger said lorain but
that business about my being wanted
by the police of three continents was
a bit thick

  maybe not said hartly with a
grin you quite look the part perry
houssa

command



 you chaps in intelligence certainly
 do enter into the spirit of the thing
 damn you carl brocton like a
 wild boar snatched at the gun in his
 holster you will never take me in
 alive

   he fired the bullet plowing into a
 pillar of the porch just a foot to the
 left of hartlys head from a window
 of a bungalow a rifle roared brocton
 fell like a tree a bullet in his head

   too bad said hartley staring
 down at the dead man that orderly
 of mine is so impulsive when he
 thinks im in danger

   perhaps its just as well said
 lorain gazing at the corpse what
 nationality would you say he was
 hartly

   mongrel i think with the worst of
 all of them in him said hartly he
 got to his feet ill have this taken
 care of right away he motioned to
 the native orderly and said a few
 words come on inside lets have
 breakfast he smiled at the intelli-
 gence man nice to have someone to
 talk to while slade is away

   they went inside the house without
 a second look at the corpse men had
 to be hard in this river country it was
 the only way lorain knew that and
 there was not the slightest doubt of it
 in the mind of hartly of the houssas

prequently thrilling adven-
 tures publishes yarns of the tropics
in which the setting may describe peril and
treachery in africa south america the
pearl islands of the south seas yet bear-
ing out the adage that truth is stranger
than fiction did you globe trotters know
that in distant undiscovered fastnesses in
the worlds tropical regions animal and hu-
man colonies exist which defy the greatest
flights of our imaginations

  every once in a while some expedition
from a faraway land comes home to report
amazing discoveries traces of past and
present civilizations of whose existence we
were not even aware even though the
great explorations of the past find no coun-
terpart in the adventures of today it may
well be that when this troubled world
finally settles down again private societies
and governments will resume their interest
in bringing to light the deep mysterious
unknown lands of this earth

the lost world

 a great many of you globe trotters
must remember the old silent motion pic-
ture the lost world based on the late
sir arthur conan doyles imaginative
thrilling novel of that title the locale was
in south america on a great plateau in-
habited by prehistoric monsters huge in-
credible animals such as the brontosaurus
and the dread tyrannosaurus rex literally
king of them all as the word rex
latin for king implies

  the tyrannosaurus rex was an interest-
ing reptile something you would not like
to meet walking down the hall at night
in fact the hall would have to be very
large and the flooring quite solid for mr
t rex was a gentleman known to be  feet
in length and quite terrifying he was also
 feet in height and the greatest meat-
eater of all time with vicious teeth six
inches long and an inch wide

  the brontosaurus on the other hand
was herbivorous - an eater of vegetable
matter but no kangaroo friends even
though he didnt eat meat this gigantic
lizard was unarmored but it had four legs
with elephantine limbs and feet long
giraffelike neck and a very small head and
brain when brother bronto really wanted

to grow he could attain a full length of
 feet

 and when these two animals - tyran-
nosaurus and brontosaurus meat-eater and
vegetarian-met in battle it was something
to see and chill the heart in the lost
world the brontosaurus got the worst of
the argument and was knocked off a preci-
pice taking half the cliff with him

  another terrifying creature was the pte-
rodactyl-a huge wing-fingered bat lizard
with a reptiles jaw and body and massive
leathery wings to which fingerlike claws
were attached this little bird measured at
least  feet in length had a wingspread
of at least twice that much and was never
kept in a cage and fed lettuce

the zahl expedition

  all of these monstrosities came to mind
the other day when we read the report of
the zahl expedition to the british guiana-
venezuela section of south america dr
paul a zahl research associate of the
haskins laboratory in union college at
schenectady n y-home of the famous
general electric research laboratories-
made his most important find in the dis-
covery of a truly lost village of aboriginal
indians

  these indians had built their village in
a huge gorge nearly half a mile above sea
level and yet more than a mile below the
top of mount roraima british guiana and
venezuela this was the approximate
locale for the lost world and incred-
ibly enough here dr zahl found an au-
thentic animal which may very well be the
survivor of the prehistoric age which
conan doyle depicted

 this creature was an ant some two
inches in length the largest presumably
on earth at any rate we never want to
come across any while out in the woods
this little beggar is called dinoponera
grandis and he doesnt like to play marbles
in fact dr zahl captured some  of
these ants and had the misfortune to be
bitten by just one of them one was
enough he got stung on the leg and the
limb became partially paralyzed for almost
two hours

  the indians however were the most in-
teresting discoveries these simple un-


the globe trotter



spoiled folk according to dr zahl lead a
virtually untroubled existence with happy
and harmonious relations the keyword
among all which recalls to mind the
poetic races of the south seas before the
white man came but it is hardly likely
that anyone will want to civilize these
people living under the summit of majestic
mount roraima

            giant waterfalls
dr zahl also discovered two great
waterfalls each surpassing the drop of
niagara falls by ten times the first one is
at the lip of a previously uncharted gorge
from which the uitshi river plunges be-
tween  and  feet further down
the zahl party found the second falls with
its roar so thunderous and awesome that
the indians in the village had never dared
to discover the reason for so much noise

  there are then still distant mysterious
lands to explore still great discoveries to
be found still great achievements to be
made in the never-charted realm of explo-
ration to dr peter a zahl congratula-
tions for proving to us once again that ex-
ploration is still one of mans greatest ad-
ventures

        bigger than chicago
well thats something we didnt know
-that shanghai china is a larger city than
our own chicago we asked s gordon
gurwit to write something about himself
and his experiences and the author of this
months hangup novelet flame of
the peacock lost no time in reply-
ing take the floor gordon

dear globe trotter

  shanghai the locale of flame of the peacock is-
believe it or not-a larger city than chicago with
more population and far more cosmopolitan and
sophisticated most americans wont believe this
but it happens to be true the iearl of the
orient has for years been the spy center of the
eabt and it has been said that anything could
happen in shanghai

  due-according to my family-to a misspent
youth i first saw this town long ago before the
fighting of  had damaged any part of it
frankly i was amazed skyscrapers taxis boule-
vards hotels-i hadnt expected this in ancient
china x had a letter of introduction to a staff
member of one of the news-gathering agencies
where i was supposed to try for a job as reporter
bo i called a taxi and went there first

  a job was necessary if i was to stay in shanghai
since there wasnt too much money in the frayed
wallet i carried and i certainly did want to stay
there well i was lucky-i got a temporary job
because another reporter was under the weather
and i was to fill his place until he got back

  i found a boarding house in the international
settlement and set out freshly fed to explore this
fascinating city my duties were to cover the in-
coming liners and the custom house which is on
the bund-and the bund is the riverside boule-
vard that runs along the whangpoo branch of the
yangtze river the bund alone can furnish mate-
rial for a dozen stories some day well write them
maybe

  but it was in the teeming streets of chapei and
pootung and hongkew-neighborhood in shang-
hai-that i found my greatest interest after the
days work was turned in and the urge for explo-
ration and adventure could be indulged even
those days the japanese concession near chapei

continued from page 

was policed by ronins-japanese muscle men-
and they had a nasty way with foreigners who
came poking around so i didnt get far there
but in adjoining chapei i met an old chinaman
who ran a tea house he spoke fair english and
was one of the oltschool chinese

  he first told me about the legends of the last
empress fabulous jewels and how they had been
scattered all over when the manchu dynasty col-
lapsed a member of his family had come upon
one of them and with it came instructions to
deliver it to a certain man in shanghai during
the night the jewel was stolen

  what happened i asked

  oh he died said the old chinaman with
honor

  with honor i asked by this time i had
bumped into the fatalistic code of the chinese
which  confess is a bit beyond western compre-
hension

  he explained how his relative had swallowed
gold leaf which closed his throat the man had
sat down calmly and died he had failed in an
important mission and that was the only way out
for him so he took it what happened to the
jewel no one knew i prided myself on being a
pretty shrewd reporter having chased news elu-
sive and otherwise in many cities and for a
moment i had an idea that id take up the search
for the missing jewel

  but if you stroll through chinese sections and
hear the many tongues spoken anything from
mandarin and cantonese to shambo and shensi
you begin to understand that without a knowledge
of half a dozen chinese dialects youd be lost i
gave that up

  naturally another focal point for a young fel-
low on the loose was the night life-the night clubs
and cafs on avenue edouard vii on thibet
road the bund another young man and i-
he was also a boarder at the same place where i
stayed-used to take in the night spots together
he was an old resident of shanghai and worked
on the north china press and he seemed to know
everybody in town

  we sat watching a floor show one night when
he pointed out a very attractive young woman
who sat at another table

  a white russian he said refugee from the
bolsheviks they say she used to be a countess
now they say shes a spy

  i stared first of course i thought of mata
hari the girl didnt look like a spy to me

  who does she spy for i asked

  my companion smiled and shrugged they say
for china you know japan grabbed off shantung
from germany at the beginning of the world
war china didnt like it and boycotted japanese
goods then japan agreed to sell the territory to
china and china bought it back now china and
japan and germany are all fishing under cover
for control dots goes on in shanghai under
cover

  the chorus came out and they were very pretty
girls even by western standards my friend
chuckled

  ever seen anything prettier in the states he
demanded

  only the ziegfeld peaches i confessed for the
specially chosen chinese chorines were unusually
good looking

  we sat and smoked and talked and i watched
the spy to see if she would do anything out
of the ordinary but she didnt she was joined
later by a fine-looking man in evening clothes
and they sat smiling and talking

  that egg volunteered my friend is a steam-
ship official his hair and mustache will give you
his nationality id give a back tooth to know
what theyre talking about they say hes guite
thick with the germans here your guess is as
good as mine

dooks like the makings for a front page yarn

i ventured

yeah he agreed only youll never get it

  a month later the beautiful young woman was
found with her throat slit from ear to ear in her
house in the french concession so maybe there
was a story brewing between these two i never
knew

  for another month i rambled through the native
quarters and went home when the clock on the
chamber of commerce building showed one and
two in the morning and one day when i got to
the globe trotter



the boarding house the chinese houseboy told me
that one-piece man was waiting for me

  it was the reporter whose job i had he was
recovered fully and wanted to meet me and find
out if i intended to stay since he had a wife i
told him id quit and let him have his job back

  two days later i left shanghai bound for hong
kong and macao i had always wanted to see
those two towns and a restless wanderlust drove
me on anyone with a nose for news could even
then sense the antagonism between the chinese
and the japanese so in - when the first
open breaks came between them i was not sur-
prised i had anticipated that fighting by writing
a dozen stories about it

  every now and then i mull over my notebook
for story material and come across old notes made
in shanghai at these times this great modern
city rises up again in my mind twentieth century
and yet oriental and bizarre-and still the spy
capital of the east in one of these retrospective
moments the idea for flame of the peacock was

thrilling adventures

        continued from page 
from jack cales  grand ave phoenix
arizona jack feels the old wanderlust
creeping up on him and before we know
it hell be off again he writes us

  i am twenty-one years old was born in texas
and have spent the greater part of my life in the
country along the mexican border have worked
my way from georgia to arizona and i am using
this experience as a backlog to work my way
around the world my greatest ambition

  in the next year or so im going to try to work
my way to central or south america perhaps
some of you globe trotters can lend me a helping
hand on this id greatly appreciate any advice
youd like to give me i can read write and of
course speak spanish and that should certainly
be a help

  no doubt about it jack spanish is a
great language to work with and many
people think our future as a nation lies to
the south in the latin american republics
good luck on your trip when you shove
off

 no letter-parade would be complete
without hearing from a sea-going globe
trotter lets look in on the adventures
of frank zumba  quentin road
brooklyn n y

  during twenty months on the sea ive had
plenty of experiences which have taken me to the
cape verde islands trinidad bermuda south
america and to some thirteen ports along the
southern and eastern coasts of africa

  on my way to capetown south africa from
new york the weather was terrible oh boy that
was something when the ship rolled the deck
hit the sea and when she pitched the propeller
rose clear of the water it took us thirty days to
make capetown as if that werent bad enough i
was laid up with malaria in beira east africa

  i could even go back a bit and tell you about
our trip to mombasa east africa in april 
when we arrived on a rainy day and left twenty
days later-the rain still coming down in sheets

  on my last trip we ran into the worst weather
of all that hurricane which swept the eastern
coast of this couptrv in september  and raised
such cain in new england we were headed for
new york from trinidad and the waves that that
blow threw up on deck were something to see

  stormy weather eh frank we hope
that sunny skies and brisk winds attend
your next sailoring and mention not that
new england hurricane our old ialopy
broke its heart on those ravaged massa-
chusetts highways and it cost us fifty
bucks for repairs

  thanks for your letters globe trotters
and lets see some more of em pronto

        liberty at the crossroads

  nowadays when freedom and dictator-
ship seem to be constantly at each others
throats its heartening to come across such
great yarns as jackson coles dramatic
novelet fight for freedom which
is in this issue about his story mr cole
has this to say

dear globe trotter

  the fight for freedom of the dutch people
against their spanish oppressors in the th and
th centuries finds a counterpart today in spain
and china and need i add in czecho-slovakia
which even as i write this has fallen asunder de-
serted by her allies and bereft of her original
frontiers of defense

  history it would seem moves in cycles there
la a period of tyranny sometimes extending a gen-

eration or more which in the end is succeeded by
a popular revolt against oppression economic and
political and the denial of such elementary human
rights as religion freedom of speech press and
assembly

  in fight for freedom i have delved into
history in an attempt to recreate the atmosphere
and tension of the late th century when the
spaniards under king philip the second and his
minion the duke of alva governor of the nether-
lands strove ruthlessly to put down rebellion and
were successfully defeated at alkmaar by sturdy
determined burghers who had never known the
benefits of military discipline and tactics

  which need i say points an interesting parallel
for today

with good wishes

  new york city

  well mr cole our answer to that is the
old standby history repeats itself
maybe thats why historical novels and
stories are so popular today people like
to read in the past to get some idea of
what can happen all over again

information please

  our friend ed earl repp author of this
months exciting western novelet
renegade payoff has his eye on a
little trip across the pacific and is anxious
to get a few tips from you globe trotters
who know your way around how about
it fellers

dear globe trotter

  i havent much to say about renegade pay-
off but i would like to palaver with some of you
globe trotters whove been down around the phil-
ippines

  im scheming to take a little pasear down that
way within the next year or so and dont want to
bother with the main ports where all you see
is what the chamber of commerce points out to
the tourist i prefer to hit into the less-known
section of the islands where a feller stands a
chance of losing his head and getting some first-
hand yarns for spinning in thrilling adven-
tures

  its been my pet idea for a long time-and its
hard to say what will happen to it when my boss
and severest critic gets wise-to take a tramp
steamer to manila there buy or charter a good 
to -foot ketch and sail clear around the islands
touching at the most out-of-the-way ports they
have

  no doubt many of you old globe trotters have
been down around that part of the world and can
give a lubber like me in search of adventure some
idea where a copious dish of the same can be
found there fool am i maybe i am but i think
i can take it i know what slugs sound like when
they come whistlin at you and i dont think id
more than flinch if some igorote took a swipe at
me with a bolo of lcris

  you never have to worry about the bullets that
miss you or the bolos that fail to connect with
your hackles its the ones you dont hear that
count well ill be most grateful to any of you
fellers wholl drop me a line telling me not to
miss this place or that and when i get there you
can bet well take em in or lose our heads trying
how about it

best wishes

a money-making opportunity

             for men of character

              exclusive franchise for

   an invention expected to replace
   a multi-million-dollar industry

costly work formerly
sent out by business men
now done by themselves
at a fraction of the expense

         this is a call for men everywhere to handle
         exclusive agency for one of the most
         unique business inventions of the day

fort years ago the horse and buggy business was supreme-today
almost extinct twenty years ago the phonograph industry ran into
many millions-today practically a relic only a comparatively few
foresighted men saw the fortunes ahead in the automobile and the
radio yet irresistible waves of public buying swept these men to
fortune and sent the buggy and tne phonograph into the discard so
are great successcs made by men able to detect the shift in public favor
from one industry to another

now another change is taking place an old established industry-an integral
and important part of the nations structure-in which millions of dollars change hands
every year-is in thousands of cases being replaced by a truly astonishing simple inven-
tion which does the work better-more reliably-and at a cost often as low
as  of what is ordinarily paid it has not required very long for men
who nave taken over the rights to this valuable invention to do a remarkable business
and show earnings which in these times arc almost unheard of for the average man

earnings

one man in california earned over  per month for three
months-elose to  in  days time another writes
from delaware-since i have been operating just a little
less than a month of actual selling and not the full day at
that because i have been getting organized and had to spend
at least half the day in the office counting what i have sold
outright and on trial i have made just a little in excess of one
thousand dollars profit for one month a connecticut man
writes he has made - in a single days time texas man
nets over  in less than a weeks time space does not per-
mit mentioning here more than these few random cases how-
ever they are sufficient to indicate that the worthwhile future
in this business is coupled with immediate earnings for the
right kind of man one man with us has already made over
a thousand sales on which his earnings ran from  to 
per sale and more a great deal of this business was repeat
business yet he had never done anything like this before
coming with us that is the kind of opportunity this business
offers the fact that this business has attracted to it such
business men as former bankers executives of businesses-
men who demand only the highest type of opportunity and
income-gives a fairly good picture of tne kind of business this
is our door is open however to the young man looking for
the right field inwhich to make his start and develophis future

not ogadget-

not a knick-knack-

    but a valuable proved device which
    has been sold successfully by busi
    ness novices as well as seasoned
    veterans

make no mistake-this is no novelty-no flimsy creation
which the inventor hopes to put on the market you
probably have seen nothing like it yet-perhaps never
dreamed of the existence of such a device-yet it has already
been used by corporations of outstanding prominence-by
dealers of great corporations-by their branches-by doc-
tors newspapers publishers-schools-hospitals etc etc
and by thousands of small business men you dont have to
convince a man that he should use an electric bulb to light
his office instead of a gas lamp nor do you have to sell
the same business man the idea that some day he may need
something like this invention the need is already there-
the money is usually being spent right at that very
moment -and the desirability of saving the greatest
part of this expense is obvious immediately

some of the savings
you can show

you walk into an office and put down before your prospect
a letter from a sales organization showing that they did
work in their own office for  which formerly could have
cost them over  a building supply corporation pays
our man  whereas the bill could have been for 
an automobile dealer pays our representative  whereas
the expense could have been over  a department
store has expense of  possible cost if done outside
the business being well over  and so on we could
not possibly list all cases here these are just a few of
the many actual cases which we place in your hands to
work with practically every line of business and every
scction of the country is represented by these field reports
which hammer across dazzling convincing money-saving
opportunities which hardly any business man can fail to
understand

          profits typical of
     the young growing industry

going into this business is not like selling something
offered in every grocery drug or department store for
instance when you take a  order  can be your
share on  worth of business your share can be
 the very least you get as your part of every
dollars worth of business you do is  cents-on ten
dollars worth  on a hundred dollars worth 
-in other words two thirds of every order you get is
yours not only on the first order-but on repeat orders
-and you have the opportunity of earning an even larger
percentage

this business has
nothing to do with
house to house canvassing

nor do you have to know anything about high-pressure
selling selling is unnecessary in the ordinary sense of
the word instead of hammering away at the customer
and trying to forcc a sale you make a dignified
business-like call leave the installation-whatever size
the customer says he will accept-at our risk let the
customer sell himself after the device is in and working
this docs away with the need for pressure on the cus-
tomer-it eliminates the handicap of trying to get the
money before the customer has really convinced himself
 you simply toll what you offer showing proof of
success in that customers particular line of business
then leave the invention without a dollar down it
starts working at once in a few short days the installa-
tion should actually produce enough cash money to pay
for the deal with profits above the investment coming in
at the same time you then call back collect your money
nothing is so convincing v our offer to let results speak
for themselves without risk to the customer while others
fail to get even a hearing our men are making sales
running into the hundreds they have received the atten-
tion of the largest firms in the country and sold to the
smallest businesses by the thousands

no money need be risked

in trying this business out you can measure the possi-
bilities and not be out a dollar if you art looking for a
business that is not ovtrcrowdtd-a business that is just
coming into its own-on the upgrade instead of the
downgrade-a business that offers the buyer relief from
a burdensome but unavoidable expense-a business that
has a prospect practically in every office store or factory
into which you can set foot-regardless of size-that is j
ntctssity but docs not have any price cutting to contend
with as other necessities do-that because you control
the sales in exclusive territory is your own business-
that pays more on some individual sales than many men makr
in a week and sometimes in a months time-if such a business
looks as if it is worth investigating get in touch with us
at once for the rights in your territory-dont delay-
because the chances are that if you do wait someone else
will have written to us in the meantime-and if ir turns
out that you were the better man-wed both be sorry
