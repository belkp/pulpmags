the deaf gan

hear

 distinctly evexy sound-even whisp-
 ers do not escape them when they are
 properly assisted deafuess is due
 to the ear drums from some cause be- a j 
 coming defective i offer you the same
 hope of hearing as you have of seeiug
 from the oculist who supplies glasses to
 help your eyesight-for i apply the same
 common sense principle in my method of
 restoring hearing the weakened or
 impaired parts must be reinforced by
 suitable devices to supply what is lacking
 and necessary to hear among the  people who
 have been restored to perfect hearing there has been
 every condition of deafness or defective hearing no
 matter what the cause or how long standing the case
 the testimonials sent me show marvelous results

 common sense ear drums

    have restored to me my own hearing-thats how i
    happened to discover the secret of their sttccess in
    my own desperate endeavors to be relieved of my
    deafness after physicians had repeatedly failed

    common sense ear drums are made of a soft
    sensitized material comfortable and safe to wear
    they are out of sight when worn and easily ad-
    justed by the wearer

    it is certainly worth your while to investigate
    before you send any money just drop me a line i
    want to send you free of charge my book on deafuess
    and plenty of evidence to prove to you that i am
    entirely worthy of your confidence why not write

   the styleplus
declaration of independence

one year ago when wc decided to utilize the facilities of this the first and
largest mens clothing manufactory in this country for the purpose of pro-
ducing a finer line of mens clothing than the world had ever seen sold for
a medium price we determined-

that woa neither consider
     nor be bound by any previous
     standard of clothing value

that raatter what quality of
     fabric had been deemed good
     enough for suits and over-
     coats of medium price only
     fabrics of pure wool or of
     wool and silk should ever be
     made up into styleplus suits
     and overcoats

that even though medium-priced
      clothing may be made en-
      tirely by labor-saving ma-
      chinery every styleplus coat
      should be hand tailored

that no matter what the precedent
       all styleplus fabrics includ-
       ing the canvas haircloth
       and tape that are used to
       make styleplus garments re-
       tain their fitting qualities
       and shape should be thor-
       oughly shrunk

that no matter what the custom
      among those who have in the
      past manufactured medium-
      priced garments each style-
      plus garment should be de-
      signed and cut by master
      workmen worthy to work on

       the finest garments that any
       amountof money can produce

that no mater hw much profit
      the average manufacturer has
      demanded in the past we
      would so adjust our profits
      that each styleplus garment
      could be retailed for 

      that same price the world
      over

that without regard to custom as
      regards the responsibility of
      the maker we would uncon-
      ditionally guarantee each
      styleplus suit and each
      styleplus overcoat so that
      the dealer from whom you
      buy a styleplus garment will
      freely and immediately ex-
      change it for a new one
      should it fail to give abso-
      lutely satisfactory wear

that matter what price men
     had been forced to pay for
     durable stylish clothing we
     would enable each purchaser
     of a styleplus suit or over-
     coat to be suitably clothed
     for any time or place and
     we would enable him to
     save from  to  on each
     purchase

this was our declaration of independence we have adhered to
it and by so doing have upset all known valuc-staudards of mens clothing

         if you are conscientious you have no right to buy a suit
         or overcoat until you have examined styleplus clothes

down the worlds
    steepest grade

       by frederick a talbot

                    author of the railway conquest of the world

ninety-nine persons out of a
hundred would say that < >brian
the erecting engineer was irish
and i hose ninety-nine would lie wrong
notwithstanding the apparent hibernian
flavor of the patronymic and the uncon-
ventional method of spelling a well-
known name

  but obrian eertainlv has the humor

of those from the emerald isle and one
enjoys this to the utmost when he under-
takes to turn raconteur

   brian was the erecting engineer of
the leipzig aerial ropeway bleicheri
and conipahv when they undertook to
climb to the top of the inland plateau of
german east africa to establish a line
to bring down the vast wealth of cedar

where the german east africa railway begins a drop ok  feet in five and

one-half miles

 rr	i


railroad maxs magazine

growing in those latitudes for the lead
pencils and furniture manufacturers

  germany like other countries is suf-
fering from a dearth of this wood anu
it has hit several of her industries hard
the colony  the eastern seaboard of
the african continent was lying unfor-
gotten almost when somebody came
back from the interior with stories of
great cedar groves

  timber cruisers went out for a prom-
inent berlin house and the wanderers
statements were confirmed then the
home house got busy they would get
that timber down to the coast

drops  feet in  - miles

  it was a case of being easier said than
done there was a matter of  feet
difference in altitude between the groves
and the shipping point below and thi
difference in level had to be overcome in
less than live and a half miles

  the worst jump was one of  feet
from the paganis plains to lsambara
among the clouds over rocky cliffs
which seemed as if they had been
trimmed with a giants chisel and the
chips left lying around

  the surveyors reconnoitered the coun-
try and returned with a doleful story
a surface line was quite out of the
question unless the nmcessioiinaircs were
prepared to spend more money than they
would ever earn

  but a line through the air why
that would fill the situation perfectly

  engineer obrians house took up t ie
matter this firm had thrown a thin
cable over one of tbe worst stretches of
the andes had met the coal-shipping
situation in spitzbergen found a means
of getting the ore down to the coast in
new caledonia and had fixed up a
transport system near pekin all via the
air so they saw no tangible reason why
the same system should not be feasible
in africa

  expense was a governing factor but
rleicliert and company undertook that
this desideratum would be studied to the
utmost degree

  the surveyors had a lively time plot-
ting that line the first preliminary
showed that they were going to be up
against it all the way the forest was
as dense as tropical jungle only can be

and tbe surveyors were warned to keep
a sharp lookout for lions and other
denizens of the forest who roamed as
thickly as black bears in the rockies

  they hustled up a few natives to act
as guides chore boys and assistants
coils of rope were carried to let down
the men with the transit to plot from
difficult ledges and to hold them on
footings where an eagle would have had
a mighty stiff struggle to perch

  survey after survey was run but the
sum of one and all showed that the enter-
prise would bristle with some ticklish
problems that there would have to be
some terrifying gradients and stiff leaps
through the air from crag to crag

  a single swing of  feet seemed
inevitable but when the location line
was run the surveyors found that this
leap could be split into three stages by
seizing two ledges on the mountain to
erect angle stations

 the work was commenced it was
found rough going through rugged
primevalism with thirty-feet lengths of
steel slung  the shoulders of the
coolies and carried for miles by a cir-
cuitous route to where the towers were
to be erected

  the blacks concluded that union in
this case meant safety they have a
dread of man-eaters born of terrible
experience so when they got warning
that a lion was on the prowl they
promptly dropped their loads and
swarmed the nearest trees to wait until
the danger had passed or had been
scared away by a white man who did not
miss the opportunity to indulge in a big-
game hunting interlude

when the lions came

  then the coolies would come to earth
again displaying their ivory white teeth
in broad grins of pleasure and gratitude
to their white preservers hoist up the
chunk of metal and walk on again with
slowly measured steps

  the african native may be a poor
engineer but he is smart in detecting
the presence of a lion and after a few
scares the europeans came to the con-
clusion that they might copy black art-
fulness in the bush

  this was particularly the case when
the teams of oxen were out pulling the
down the worlds steepest crade



heavy loads each train would be ac-
companied by its black drivers when
suddenly all would be scared at the
glimpse of a man-eater and the teams
being left to their fate

  losses from this cause became ex-

ceedingly awkward so the engineers
went rummaging for tame monkeys buy-
ing and bartering them from the negroes
the ape is the danger signal of the
forest with a particular aversion for
lions lions in africa unlike the
majority of their ilk are exceedingly
bold and do not hesitate to attack in
broad daylight

  our apes were chained to the tops of

trees around the working camps and
boxes were nailed to the branches to
house them they were fed regularly
and plentifully and the engineers had
every cause to bless these vigilant sen-
tinels

  ihc monkey is naturally very curious
and these tame brutes spent their time
 jeering into the jungle on every side
with sharp eyes

  directly the tan coat of a man-eater
was spotted or his presence sniffed the
monkeys gave vent to the most jjicrcing
shrieks as if suffering untold torture
but the graders did not worry it was
simply the signal for down tools

after tub steep grade has hkkn madk the ckdar-lg i rain sweeps throlgu the

station at eighty miles an inn k

and shin the nearest tree as the king
of beasts was prowling around in search
of a meal

  the hostility of nature was empha-
sized in another manner the engineers
had selected a small ledge on a cone-
shaped peak for ail angle station when
the builders arrived there they found the
rock soft and crumbly it was s me
what difficult to blast away as there
were so many missed shots and blow-
outs but by persistence they cleared a
highly satisfactory platform where tit
angle station could be erected

grade is  per cent

  the foundations of tile building were
about to be commenced when the con 
gave signs of shifting and several thou-
sand tons of debris slipped onto the
leveled ledge the engineers getting
clear in the nick of time

  with infinite labor the rubbish was
cleared away and then came another
slip this was similarly sent rattling
down the mountain slopes and then a
retaining wall was built so as to lean
against tbe side of the peak the space

behind was filled with concrete rammed
well home

  this kept the sliding mountain slopes
within bounds and the angle station was
completed

  the section between the first and sec-
tion angle stations is particularly inter-
esting inasmuch as it is the steepest
piece of transportation line in the world
the gradient being per cent

  the swing through the air has been
subdivided by means of an intermediate
tower too feel in height run upwards
from a friendly notch in the rock so
that the line droops in two festoons each
about yyo feet in length

  when one is traveling over this line
to the interior -and it is the only means
whereby the plateau may be gained-
one has to perform an acrobatic feat
unless care is shown the friendly timber
log on which one is sitting rears up and
tips you head downward the point
is to see that you have your balance so
set that when the log strikes the grade
you are almost in an upright position

  this sensation is varied by making a
clean dive through the air in a single
span exceeding  feet if anything
down the worlds steepest grade



ever goes wrong with the passenger-
carrying facilities in the center of this
span the traveler will make a straight
dive of oo feet to the valley below

  the tropical rains gave the engineers
endless anxiety six supports had been
decided as being necessary to support
the line at one place and a computation
for the removal of  cubic feet of
earth was considered ample

  the tirst downpour showed the engi-
neers the error of their ways because
the whole lot was blotted out bv a fall
of earth the builders thereupon de-
cided to make a bigger excavation and
before they had finished   cubic
feet or three times as much as contem-
plated originally were cleared away

  at different points stretchers are pro-
vided to keep the ropes taut these ten-
sion stations comprise steel towers fitted
with sheaves over which the ropes pass
to be attached to a ponderous weight
built up of concrete blocks placed in a
steel cradle

  these weights being permitted to rise
and fall within the tower serve to keep
the ropes at an even tension at the
angle stations where a sharp deviation
to one side has tn be made the load is

pushed over from one traveling rope to
the other by manual labor

  the cars handle logs up to c feet in
length and  pounds in weight ihey
are strapped to two carriages connected
by the traction rope fitted with the
bleichert  automat  coupling whereby
a tight grip on the rope may be cal-
culated when an increase in the grip
power is desired as on the steepest grade
thereare detents right and left of the
hanger pin against which the hanger stay
leans during the climb

white ants destroyed i imber

  directly the grade is overcome and an
easier stretch of line is entered the grip
is automatically released a little to ac-
commodate the appliance to the changed
conditions one great advantage of this
arrangement is that the traction rope is
preserved against wear and tear

  cut timber is carried on flat-bottom
suspended carriers which by the way
are employed also for carrying passen-
gers who have to display no little dex-
terity when riding up and down the 
per cent grade

the engineers had some lively time

at the edge of the piateaij where the railway starts on its eighty-six per cent grade


railroad maxs magazine

angle station ii built os a lklnk cut in tilk mountainside over jcxhl feet from the iiakf

in transporting the heavier parts of the
plant and constructional material
everything had to lie wrought in metal
or masonry as the ravages of the white
ants meant a short life wherever timber
was used this hit the builders severely
struggling over the rough broken coun-
try against heavy gradients with such
weighty and bulky articles as cement
water and steel was slow costly and
difficult

  the greatest difficulty in the direction
was in connection with a locomobile re-
quired for the loading station a special
clearing had to be marie through the
jungle to permit its passage it demand-
ed the combined efforts of a hundred
natives and a staff of europeans seven
months to gel the engine from the junc-
tion between the aerial railway and the
surface adhesion system to the top of the
plateau several thousand dollars were
expended on this bit of work alone

how the great speed is checked

  before the natives could advance with
any requisitions special trails had to be
blazed so that the porters with their
cumbersome loads on their shoulders
could move with comparative rapidity

  then the engineers had to scour the
country for labor bringing in negroes
from distant points for the reason that
the masai could not be persuaded or
tempted to work

  under these adverse conditions trans-
port and labor expenses rose to an ab-
normal level excelling the cost of the
material several times over

  when everything was ready for tin-
ropes engineer obrian turned to his
staff early one morning and remarked
 ill inspect the supports once more to
day and then well put on the ropes
lie started off on his donkey accom-
panied by two natives they were jog-
ging quietly along the isanibara plateau
the engineer with his eagle eye fixed 
the cleavage through the trees down
which the steel towers were spaced

  they had just passed the sixth support
when his steed gave a startled neigh and
a plunge catching the rider unawares
the result was that engineer obrian
executed an unrehearsed somersault in
the air and tobogganed face downward
along the ground

  the negroes with a yell plunged into
the bush with the donkey at their heels
while instruments and tools were scat-
tered on the ground wondering at the
down the worlds steepest grade

a do --le car carrying two locis forty-six feet long an u weighing a ton

cause of the disturbance and desiring to
have a look round mr obrian shinned
up the sixth tower he was just run-
ning his eyes over the trees when up
popped the scared face of one attendant
on tower  followed by that of the
second native  tower 

  the three clung to their perches for
several hours enjoying an african sun-
bath ifexperiencing other discomforts
including attacks from mosquitoes until
they concluded that descent might be
made advantageously and safely what
was the reason for the disturbance the
donkey had sniffed the trail of a lion
which had passed several hours before

  as may be supposed the descending
loads coming down the steepest grades
are liable to attain terrific speed so they
must be held in check as the upward
going is comparatively light the drive
is calculated on the maximum of the
ascending load and all the excess power
developed by the descending weight is
absorbed by a brake regulator

  a  horse-power electric motor is
quite adequate to supply all the power
required while the braking effort is taken
up by a sheave about six and a half feet
in diameter the brakes being able to
neutralize about too horse-power

  the brake is hydraitlically operated
and absolutely automatic in its action
there being a high-level reservoir con-
taining about fifty-live cubic feet of
water above the loading station to keep
the brake-box regularly supplied with
water also a low-level concrete reservoir
for water in the dry season this being
connected with the high-level feed-tank
by pumping

  although the railway is designed
essentially for handling lumber any one
penetrating the interior and willing to
experience a weird and unusual sensa-
tion may straddle a log or mount one of
the platforms and be whisked up or
down

  it requires no little nerve to keep a
level head on the heavy banks sliding
down the  per cent grade astride a log
when there is a dip in the sag of the rope
makes one clutch tightly it knocks the
breath out of the tenderfoot but as mr
brian says  you soon get accustomed
to parachuting and blondin stunts

  when the vice-governor of the prov-
ince decided to make a journey of in-
spection to the plateau he traveled with
his suite by the usambara aerial line
the platform passenger car was placed
at the disposal of the official but the


railroad maxs magazine

gentlemen accompanying him had to
make themselves as comfortable as they
could astride a tree trunk

  several ladies have made the trip a
friend of mine tried it balancing himself
around a cedar log as he slipped down
the  per cent grade he felt as he ex-
pressed it as if the soles of his feet
were shooting through his head

  although the line is only about five and
a half miles in length it took three years
to build and by the time the erecting
engineer had reported  o k on the
official tests and was satisfied that the
spiders thread would stand up to its
work over  had been spent

  does it pay well that is a question
for the owners but the fact that it
brought down  cubic feet of cedar
within the first six months tends to
prove that it has solved the transporta-
tion of lumber over a most difficult and
mountainous stretch of country at ail
events it ranks as one of the most re-
markable aerials railways ever built

  the length of the cedar-log line is five
and a half miles from the loading station
on the usambara plateau at an altitude
of  feet to the junction with the
trunk adhesion railroad at mkumbara
station on the laganis plains

  the drive and brake regulator is lo-
cated at the upper terminal the char-
acter of the work demanded a special
drive and controller

  	f only a few loads on the way to the
valley happen to be on the rising section
and other loads are on the descending
line a very considerable capacity must
be absorbed by braking during the
trial runs actual differences in capacity
of plus and minus twenty-live horse-

power were registered to maintain
control over the line an electric motor
of fifty horse-power was installed
capable of developing a high number
of revolutions and working bv means
of belting  the driving-shafi of the
ropeway

  apart from the conical driving-wheel
a timber-lined band and a sheave of some
seventy-eight inches diameter are fitted
 this shaft when stopping the line
these brakes-able to neutralize one hun-
dred horse-power - are tightened al-
though during work they are disengaged
as the regulation of the traveling speed
is effected by the brake-regulator inde-
pendently of human care and attention

  the regulator is hydraulic it is
driven by a belt from the countershaft
and consists chiefly of a rotary pump and
a balanced throttle slide the former
sucks the water from a reservoir in the
foundation-box of the apparatus and
forces it through the passages of the gov-
erning valve into the box

  the valve is actuated by a centrifugal
belt-driven regulator so soon as the
revolutions of the countershaft com-
mence to increase owing to reduced
strain  the line the throttle-slide
closes correspondingly and checks the
motion of the pump the pump then
acting on the shaft as a strong brake
the brake-box is kept regularly supplied
with water from an elevated reservoir
of fifty-five cubic feet capacity

if you will answer these questions plain-

this country will thank you

  well to give the briefest possible def-

inition the interstate commerce com-
mission is the supreme court of the
railroads or to be still more simple it
is the umpire of the big railroad ball-
game

  interstate commerce - that is com-
merce between states-found itself in a
tangled-up mess and it was necessary to
have one body of men acting as a court
to keep things running smoothly

  the interstate commerce commission

was appointed for this purpose since
it has been in existence it has been loudly
praised and severely chastised by both
public and railroads it has proved itself
both popular and unpopular but being
the highest tribunal for the settlement of

all disputes between the railroads and
the people it ranks in importance next
to the supreme court of the united
states

  commerce is the life-blood of a na-
tion and any interference with its circu-
lation means industrial apathy to
maintain a steady circulation so that all
parts of this country may continue in
mercantile health is part of the work of
the interstate commerce commission

  the demand for federal regulation of
interstate commerce is almost as old as
the country itself when the war of
independence ended the separist te i-
dencies and local jealousies that existi-d
in the case of tie majority of the s tes
led to the passage of many vexat ou
state laws framed for the purp se of
hindering if not blocking the cornier-
cinl progress of rival states

  finally the situation became so irk-
mme that in x the annapolis con-
vention was called by the virginia legis-
lature for the purp e of  considering
the trade of the united states and to de-
vise a uniform regulation of t-ranspjrta-
tioti rates that should conserve their

common interests and permanent bene-
fit

shall of the federal supreme cmrt
rfter bewailing the setback lo trade th t

eral conviction that commerce be ween

congress

modern phrase
official sense in
passed in 
 speaks of

it was first used in an
connection with an act
yet the constitution of
 commerce among that
stales  as meaning  commerce that
concerns more states than one

  more recently the courts have inter-
preted the word  commerce  to denote
not merely a mutual selling and buying
of traffic but as a term of the largest
import that includes trade in all its forms
-not only navigation transportation
and communication but also the instru-
ments and agents employed such as
express companies and telegraphic
messages

  in extreme cases commerce is even
made to include lottery tickets any
man matter or act that prevents the free
and unrestricted flow of commerce be-

tween individuals business organi-
zations corporations or states
is now subject to the scrutiny and
punitive powers of the interstate
commerce commission which is
expected to keep commercial chan-
nels clear and punish those who
try to clog them

   the tirst enactment of the inter-
state commerce act took place in
february  it was the crys-
tallization of nearly a century of
agitation and discussion the
act applied to common carriers
freight carried wholly by railroads
and partly by railroads and water
was the basis of this enactment it
forbade unjust discrimination and
undue and unreasonable rate pref-
erences  made it unlawful to
charge more for a shorter than for
a longer haul over the same line
going in the same direction the
shorter being included in the
longer although a carrier could
be freed from this provision under
certain conditions it would not
permit a pooling or division of
earnings

  during the eighteen years that
followed the passage of the act it
has done some good but not as
much as was expected discrimi-
nation against smaller shippers
and some lines of commerce con-
tinued so did secret rebating

  the anti-pooling clause prevent-
ed open but not secret agreements
between carriers the long and short
haul provision was the cause of untold
judicial wrangling and was made the
basis of a variety of court interpreta-
tions

  to a very great extent the effective-
ness of the commissioners was destroyed
by judicial decisions antagonistic to its
rulings and at the same time it had no
power to fix rates for the future

  these unsatisfactory conditions con-
tinued until in  when president
roosevelt in his message to congress
made the amendments of the interstate
commerce act the chief issue at the ses-
sions of -

  his suggestions were fought tooth and
nail by the representatives of the car-
riers after the most remarkable series
of senatorial debates heard in washing-
why theres an i c c



ton for many years a number of
amendments became law in july



  the act was strengthened in
many ways the number of com-
missioners was increased from five
to seven the salary of a com-
missioner was increased to iooro
a year

  facilities were provided for
taking evidence a clause was
introduced compelling carriers to
change rates within thirty days
after a ruling bv the commission

  furthermore the commission
was empowered to establish joint
rates and to order switches to be
built pipe lines express ard
sleeping-car companies and all
freight service and facilities were
placed under its jurisdiction it
was authorized to examine the
books of railroad companies at all
times and to mai-ce the conents of
those books public it was em-
powered to establish reasonabe
maximum rates to take effect with-
in thrly days and to continue for
two years unless ret aside by te
courts in the interval

right to lix freight rat -s other
acts were passed strenghening the
hands of the con-mission to-day it is
a tower of strength ve led with the au-
thority to inquire into a order change-
in all railroad conditions

   ne of the facors that contributes to
the power of the- commission is its el s-
ticity i commot with certain special
tribunals of the british empire it has
been shown that when such tribunal
have the authority to determine price
and rates-pro ideel that they are noi
subject to frequent changes of member-
ship-they tend to evolve from their ex-
periences a set of principles that are in
harmony with existing economic rela-
tions and tendencies that are certain to
change with the times

  in its present form the commission
fills a place in the commercial economy
of the nation the value of which can

hardly be computed the fact that a
number of its dccisio s have been over-
ruled by the courts i ro proof that it
lacks efficiency or knowle dge of the com-
mercial needs of the public

  the truth seems to be that iis deci-
sions appear to be the outcome of what
it holds arc  social and economic con-
siderations rather than a strict compli-
ance with the technicalities of the law
i other words it would seem thit it
puts the rights of the public a little ii
ad ance of the hair-splitting of the courts

  the procedure of the commission is
simple i f an individual or a corporation
deems that a carrier or a business rival
is or is attempting to violate any part
of the interstate commerce act a for-
mal complaint is made to the commis-
sion after an investigation to learn if


railroad mans magazine

the charge is warranted it cites the ac-
cused to appear the proceedings as-
sume the methods of a civil suit at a bar
of justice

  nine-tenths of the cases deal with
transportation and the brain-paralyzing
questions that arise are simply stagger-
ing a chinese puzzle is like reading the
first lesson in a reader in comparison

  the commission bases its rate-making
on  value of services instead of  cost
of service - rightfully so it would
seem concluding that  value of serv-
ice  may be defined as the  ability af-

forded the shipper to reach a market
and make his commodity an article of

commerce

in a more definite sense it means
reaching a market so as to make a profit

  these statements seem to imply that
 value of service  is measured by the
difference in the market value of the
commodity at the point of shipment and
the place of unloading but theory and
experience have taught the commission
that this difference is determined by the
railroad rate hence the persistent
watch that it keeps on such rates

  the hundreds of curious problems
which the commission is asked to solve
may best be illustrated by an example

  a complaint was instituted by the chi-
cago board of trade the defendants
being a number of railroads in the mid-

without conflict that the live hog and its
products are in direct competition with
each other the products being much
more valuable and transported at more
expense to the carriers

therefore the railroads were officially

state president of the national asso-
ciation of railway commissions

die- west charged with giving lower rates
on packing-house products from sioux
citv iowa and other western packing
centers to chicago than they gave to live
hogs when shipped to that city

  the carriers defended their practises
on a number of grounds none of which
were held by the commission to warrant
the discrimination it decided that  as
articles of commerce the evidence shows

notified that  the rates charged for live
hogs should not he greater than the rates
charged for packing-house products
the following will show the complex-
ity of some of the cases

  the shippers association of north-
west iowa complained that the illinois
central railroad company ct a charged
excessive rates  corn wheat and other
grain from sioux city and other points


railroad mans -magazine

to chicago and points  the east bank
of the mississippi river

  a certain firm asked that the lehigh
valley railroad be compelled to give the
same classifications and rates to anthra-
cite coal as were given to bituminous

  a standard oil subsidiary company
asked that the western new york and
pennsylvania railroad be ordered to
charge only on the basis of the weight
of the oil carried in barrels what it
charged for oil only if carried in tanks
and not to charge barrel shipments on
the gross weight

  to prevent railroad ties being classi-
fied as  manufactured wooden commod-
ities while a specially low rate was
charged for lumber was another puzzle

  sometimes the commission has to fall
back on mathematics for a solution
in a recent case in which the relative
rates for cabbages and potatoes was the
point at issue the commission stated 

    as the weight nf i barrel f cabbages
  is three-fourths that of a barrel of po-
  tocs and as its price in value is only
  one-half two-fourths of that of the po-
  tatoes it would seem that there is a dif-
  ference if one-fourth in favor of the
  cabbages our conclusion therefore is
  that the rate on cabbage from charleston
  to points north should lie one-fourth less
  than the rate on potatoes

slaughter of

after the completion of the santa
le the slaughter of the buffalo be-
came a most profitable industry and
the annihilation of the king of the plains
was shameful many can doubtless recall a
small lake where syracuse now stands
known in those days as the buffalo water-
ing place this locality proved to be the
harvest ground for the cruel killer and we
are not exaggerating in stating that the
pedestrian could travel five or six miles
without placing his foot on mother earth
but instead treading the distance on the
bodies of the slaughtered bison

  the lninters usually worked in threes as
they could do greater execution ami the
first hours work in the morning would be
devoted to killing usually from thirty to
forty would be their harvest and this wotdd
be a sufficient number for the clays work
the average hunter would be disappointed
if his days labor did not bring him in from
ten to twelve dollars

  the principal value of the buffalo lay in
his hide for that of a bull the captor re-

  <	>ccasionally the current value of a
commodity is accepted as a standard for
rates for example in discussing the
rate on hay the commission stated

    w hen the market price of a commodity
  yields but a scant return for labor and ex-
  pense of production the cost of trans-
  portation needs to be as moderate as may
  be consistent with justice to the carrier

  the commission has upheld the prac-
tise of certain railroads of putting immi-
grants into a special class and giving
them lower rates than were accorded to
first or second-class passengers and the
refusal of the roads to sell tickets to
other persons at the same rates as were
given to immigrants even though these
persons were willing to ride in the immi-
grant cars

ceived an average of two dollars and for a

cents a pair and the hair was a small item
later the bones were purchased by eastern
fertilizing companies rut think of the
millions of pounds of juicy buffalo steaks
and roasts that went to waste and how they
would be relished and appreciated in these
days

  the buffalo has disappeared and the cruel
hunter we hope has been forced to seek a
more humane calling for a livelihood al-
most forty years have elapsed and time
therefore has wrought many changes the
wild and desolate plains of kansas and east-

  curly hair of a hue that signaled no meek
  spirit it was red

     jest a little in the snapping-turtle

goes off whispered anse he wagged
his bald head knowingly  he aint
liked by everybody this new super
now if lie was like mr ballington-

   i grant you ballington serrill seems
to be a square sort of chap said the
disgruntled engineer  but lies only his
uncles assistant i know he did not ap-
prove of giving parsons my run and my
engine

   id hold on tom jest tli same

  the old mans speech halted his
jaws came together with a snap his
sudden silence held drifts puzzled at-
tention

  the telegraph instrument inside the
little office was rattling frantically and
drift saw that the boss was reading the
message as it came from the wire it
was plain from the expression on pren-
dergasts face that it was a message of
moment

  tire breadth of the busy yard of the
logan city terminal lay before them
chains of box cars flats dumps and
cattle-cars littered the various tracks

  a fussy little switch-engine was kick-
ing cars about in a most unmannerly
way driving them here there and every-
where and coughing derisively as the
cars scurried over the switches and
bumped with clatter and shriek into
each other

  an excursion train had just come in
from the west and still lay at the station
which was visible from the yard-office

  a mogul-a frcight-hauler-had been
relieved a few minutes before and was
waiting an opportunity to be shifted
across the yard to the roundhouse where
its fires might be drawn but the turn-
table was occupied at the moment by
no  a big new passenger-hauler
prepared to take the white crow flier
 into the east as soon as she should
be brought in from big boulder

  it was down grade into the yard from
the west and a thread of smoke above
the wooded mountainside and the faint
whistle of the flier had already warned
the yard of her approach

  the east-bound track was cleared save
for the excursion train then at the sta-
tion platform the red board was hung
out against any inbound train on that
track but the excursion train was to pull
out and a clear track given the white
crow when she was due

  it had been upon the tip of tom
drifts tongue when he first saw the
flutter of smoke above the tree tops to
say that the flier was ahead of schedule
but old anse knocked the idea out of
the engineers head

  whats the matter demanded
drift as the yardmaster got to his feet

  the sounder was still rattling there
came the sharper nearer shriek of the
white crows whistle

  gid larrabee long-legged and freck-
led bounded out of the office waving a
bit of flimsy and so excited that he could
only stutter

  never mind that cried anse
 run and have the whistle blown for
the wrecking crew

   what is it demanded drift again
seizing the old mans arm

   just what i warned serrill would
happen if he didnt have the repair gang
look more carefully after their work
to my knowledge that air-brake has
been reported five times-

   on 

   yep its give out again they
wired from julep hear her coinin
down the grade yellin like a banshee
for the hand-brakes and them shacks
cant hold such a heavy train

   shell run into this block

  by thunder tom shell run into
wuss that that gasped the old man

  drift wheeled and looked down the
yard

   the excursion  he whispered
 they cant pull her out in time

   well throw the express onto that
siding exclaimed prendergast and
started across the yard full pelt

  but the young engineer whose brain
and legs were more active overtook the
yard boss and caught him by the arm

   that string of cars is loaded youll
do a power of damage and perhaps de-
rail the express drift shouted in
prendergasts ear  listen to me
switch the mogul onto the east track-
tll meet the flier with her as she comes
down itll make mince meat of the
freight-hauler but it will stop the white
crow perhaps without serious damage
 itll make mince meat of you you
young fool  roared prendergast

  but drift was already across the in-
tervening tracks and had leaped upon
the mogul her crew had left her
drift of the white crow



steaming there unattended while waiting
for a chance to get lier into the round-
house-in itself an infraction of the
roads rules which they would later have
to explain

  foolish as he believed drifts act to
be prendergast obeyed the engineers
command he flung over the switch and
the mogul starting slowly slid onto the
main track

  the shrieking flier at that moment
dashed into view she had gathered the
momentum of twenty miles of down
grade before her air gave out and as
prendergast had prophesied the hand-
brakes retarded her speed but slightly

  at the station the train starter had
been warned from the despatchers office
but the heavy passenger train could not
be moved in time to escape a terrible
rear-end collision

  everybody saw the situation in the
same way-saving one man it was kis-
met with all but tom drift

  he alone believed there was a chance
to save both trains he opened wide
the throttle of the mogul and on her last
few pounds of steam the huge freight
hauler rolled up the yard to meet the ap-
proaching runaway

  big as no  was the mogul was
heavier by many tons she would be no
slight buffer for the on-rushing train

  yet when the flier struck the sacri-
ficed locomotive it seemed as if the
wreck must be strewn all over the logan
city yard

  prendergast his bald head shining in
the sun his shirt-sleeves fluttering tried
to overtake the mogul yelling as lie
ran

   jump tom jump you fool its
sure death youre courting 

  and tom drift knew that quite as
well as the old roundhouse boss the
tender of the freight engine would re-
ceive the full weight of the fliers charge
and must crumple up like cardboard

  drift had method in his apparent
madness however he measured the
rapidly decreasing distance between the
on-rushing flier and his engine with
clear vision his nerves were unshaken
as the monster bore so swiftly down
upon him

  he knew that behind him the track
was clear to the station-and the excur-
sion train onlv now clumsily getting

under way prendergast had shut the
switch after the mogul crossed over

  sixty-seven came plunging down the
hill with her long string of pullmans
and vestibule coaches behind her the
expected smash would be a terrific one

  suddenly drift reversed the freight
engine and with the grade in her favor
she began to slide back into the yard
again with a hand that never trembled
drift regulated her speed so that within
a few yards he worked the mogul up
to a pace but little under that of the
runaway

  fire was spurting from the brake-
shoes on either side of the heavy train
as it thundered down into the yard but
to halt it before the station was reached
was beyond the powers of the engineer
of number  or of the crew

  nearer and nearer she came drift
knowing the track ahead to be clear sel-
dom glanced in that direction his
gaze was fixed upon the monster hur-
tling down upon him

  suddenly the pilot of the flier bunted
the moguls tender the shock was ter-
rific and drift was almost thrown out
of the window but he clung like a leech
to the seat and instantly threw over the
bar again with all her weight the
freight hauler bucked back against the
runaway

  fortunately neither engine was de-
railed  but for some hundreds of yards
the mogul was pushed on by the weight
of the flier the latter not being retarded
in the least

  it was like two bulls with locked
horns the heavier pushing the other
about the paddock

  the tender of the freight engine rose
in the air its fore truck leaving the rails
entirely breaking the coupling and
thrusting the drawhead of the tender into
the cab

  bits of splintering metal flew about
drift but he stuck to his post-indeed
he could not jump for the front of the
tender had crowded into the cab

  in a cloud o escaping steam and
deafened by the shrieking brakes and
grinding ironwork the flier pushed the
obstructing locomotive down the yard

  had the engineer of the train stuck
to his bench with the pluck that signaled
tom drifts act the stopping of the flier
might have been accomplished sooner

  but lie jumped and his fireman in
following his example went to the
hospital

  the excursion train was now under
way-and not a moment too soon the
runaway came to a grinding halt the
half-wrecked freight hauler before it
just where the rear of the excursion train
had stood

  tom drift climbed through the broken
window of the wrecked mogul as a num-
ber of excited officials arrived from the
offices

  foremost was james e serrill the
division superintendent he was a man
tolerant of neither mistakes nor acci-
dents  and when he recognized the young
engineer crawling from the wreck of the
mogul his passion blazed forth

  is that your engine drift he
demanded

  drift explained-or tried to but ser-
rill interrupted

   i saw you i saw you run that
engipe in the way of the flier you
caused this wreck deliberately you
scoundrel do you realize that mogul
is worth twenty thousand dollars  

   it was the only way i saw of halting
the flier mr serrill said drift quietly

  dont talk to me ejaculated the
angry superintendent  it was done
with intention to injure the division i
know your reason and ill give you a
greater reason for wishing to injure me
and the big boulder branch

  youre discharged drift you can
go up to ballington and get your time
the big boulder can get along without
you in the future and if  have any in-
fluence with the northwestern and
pacific system youll never sit in a loco-
motive cab again

  drifts wrath had been steadily rising
he advanced now on the superintendent
with clenched hands

   youve got a right to discharge me
mr serrill-for any cause or no cause
at all i grant you that but if you try
to blacklist me tll see what the brother-
hood has to say about it youre going
a step too far-

  anse prendergast seized his arm and
dragged him aside all the idlers and
roundhouse men were pouring across
the tracks and the blowing of the round-
house whistle by gid larrabee would
quickly bring the wrecking crew

  parsons engineer of the flier who
had jumped came limping up and ser-
rill turned on him so the roundhouse
boss led the wrathful drift away

   dont make it worse by kicking he
advised  let the old man dress
parsons down a bit-it will relieve him
and by thunder parsons deserves
it think of an eagle-eye in as respon-
sible position as he was jumping-and
when the danger was practically past 
 i alius reckoned there was a chunk
of valler in jim parsons as big as one o
these vere grape-fruit hes alius been
huntin soft-snaps since he struck this
division - something showy and easy
he reckoned the white crow was his
meat

  drift was gloomily silent but pren-
dergast went on cheerfully

   i recollect such fellers as him in the
army they couldnt stand the marchin
in the infantry an so they got exchanged
into the cavalry and they couldnt stand
the joltin in the cavalry and so they
exchanged from that to the artillery
and there they couldnt stand the noise
and either got a red-tape snap at wash-
ington or exchanged over into canada
and peddled fancy soap till the war was
over i reckon parsons will peddle soap
for a while and the old man chuckled

   well he isnt any worse off than i
am growled tom drift  hes got
the sack for losing his air on a defective
brake-which was the fault of some-
body else and i got the sack for saving
the train from a bad smash-up there
doesnt seem to be much justice in either
decision

chapter ii
fate takes a hand

a flat on which was guyed a big
derrick was run alongside the
tangle of scrap iron that once had been
a freight engine and in half an hour the
track was cleared

  tom drift had watched the proceed-
ings from the doorway of prendergasts
shack and now he turned to shake the
old mans hand before leaving the yard

   well its settled for me at last
anse he said sadly  milly and i will
have to give up our little home and cast
about for a new one serrill will queer
drift of the white crow



me all over the n and p-thats sure
wed better go east

   dont you jump too quick tom
advised the boss  hey theres the
old man crossing the yard now try
him again

   what ask him to reinstate me
after what he just said if he opened
up on me again id knock him down

   tom said the old man earnestly
 you aint a very pacific cus if you
ever want to keep a job under a man like
jim serrill you want to be circumspect
ye dont palaver enough tom-ter keqj
yer job

   i couldnt keep it if i did returned
drift smiling grimly at the foremans
story  and its not in me to get down
and lick the boots of any man anse

  he squared his shoulders and turned
from the weather-beaten office of the
vardmaster taking the cinder-path to
the station

  ballington serrill the assistant super-
intendent was not the counterpart of his
uncle-in looks at least but drift did
not know him well both the serrills
were comparatively newcomers to the
big boulder division

  ballington was college bred and in the
eyes of men like tom drift who was
a thoroughly practical railroad man
seemed rather callow but the directors
of the n and p had the same degree of
confidence in the younger serrill that
they had in james e

  it was ballingtons way to be friendly
with the employees of the division and
even in the short time he had been among
them he had learned a good deal about
the big boulder men as individuals

   hows this drift  he asked when
the engineer asked for a bill of his time
to take to the cashier  are you leav-
ing us 

   i cant live on half rations and
should make a change anyway said
tom drift sharply  but mr serrill
has saved me that trouble im dis-
charged

  ballington had heard rumors of the
row over the wrecked mogui he tapped
the edge of his desk with his pencil
thought fullv

   will you wait until i have a chance
to speak with the superintendent
drift he asked

  but drift had no use for either serrill

now-he was sore at heart and plainly
showed it

   im through   he growled  just
give me my time ive served the big
boulder-in the shops and on the iron-
for ten years but theres other roads
i reckon that will pay as good wages

  ballingtons lips were closed he let
the young engineer go and soon drift
was out on the street with his pay-
envelope in his pocket and a sore heart

  for tom drift had been  born and
brought up  on the division and the
wrench of parting from the road and
his old associates would be a hard one

  he had sat behind his father in the
cab of one of the first locomotives ever
driven through the big boulder basin
and-later when the n and p had
absorbed the independent road-had
helped build the straighter line up the
stiff grade of the circular mountain wall
and over the pioco saddle

  he had served three years in the shops
-from the age of sixteen to nineteen-
and was a good mechanic as well as an
ar engineer when the road was
straightened and the white crow put on
the schedule it was understood young
as he was that tom drift and no 
were to pull the flier from big boulder
to logan city

  the change in the right-of-way was
as straight as a crows flight over the
saddle and through the valley known
as big boulder basin from the wooded
heights behind logan city the fast ex-
press looked like a white streak flashing
through the valley

  therefore the nickname  white
crow which had become attached to
train no  over the big boulder divi-
sion of the northwestern and pacific
railroad

  when james e serrill came into com-
mand at logan city however tom
drift soon found old man trouble
camping on his trail

  with slight excuse the new superin-
tendent had shifted drift from the 
and given him an inferior engine and an
inferior run in six months the best
eagle-eye on the division had been rele-
gated to a position little better than that
of a  sub

  the bitterness of all this welled up in
tom drifts soul as he left the railway
offices behind him


railroad mans magazine

  up on the mountainside close to hal-
lett crossing stood two cottages side
by side one drifts father had built
and the young engineer and his sister
milly occupied it now

  the cottage long ago had been the
home of the longstreets but since
those early days mr longstreet had
made a mint of money out of a mine
had moved down into the city proper
had built a handsome home for his fam-
ily and dying left his wife and daughter
wealthy

  but sara longstreet and tom drift
had remained the best of friends through
all these changes tom had never
 presumed for he well knew mrs
longstreets ambitions for her daughter

  but sara herself after she had re-
turned from boarding-sch jol where she
was sent to be  finished had shown
plainly that she considered the drifts
milly and tom quite good enough to be
her friends still

  the superintendent of the division
was looked upon favorably by mrs
longstreet as a suitor for sara notwith-
standing the disparity in the ages of the
girl and serrill

  serrill had been very attentive to the
young woman until she had asked tom
drift a few questions pointblank about
the super then sara disregarding her
mothers wishes had turned her back
upon him

  result tom drift found himself out
of a job

  he paced the street which bounded
the railroad yard and shops gloomily
enough scarcely seeing the men he met
and to whom he nodded the shops were
closing for the day and many of his old
associates hailed him for drift was
popular

  suddenly at a corner of the street his
attention was turned to a crowd of
laughing and hooting boys he glanced
to the roadway and with a startled and
pained expression recognized the object
of their raillery

  a stalwart man-a man of almost
gigantic physique-marched down the
roadway paying slight attention to those
who jeered him he swung his power-
ful arms like flails his gray beard swept
the breast of his coat his eyes burned
with an insane light

   hi-yi its old jake monteith

shouted one boy to another  hes as
crazy as a loon

  hush hush exclaimed drift put-
ting the youth aside with one hand and
pushing before him into the crowd
 hes been one of the best engineers the
road ever had and working for the
big boulder is what made him as he is-
dont you know that dont anger him
boys

  but the big man paid no more atten-
tion to the throng about him than his
own old locomotive would have paid to
the buzzing of so many flies he still
swung his arms as he marched solemnly
on and now he cried in a sonorous voice

   i am from heaven and once blind
i now can see as  did in the bright days
of my youth let me spread the glad
tidings 

  attracted by the crowd two policemen
came up and seized the old man every-
body in logan city knew him he had
been one of the early locomotive engi-
neers-like drifts father-when big
boulder was in its infancy

  peering out of his cab window year
after year had finally injured jake mon-
teiths sight and - well there was no
pension in his day for the man who so
frequently stands between the traveling
public and peril

  he had been turned off by serrill with
no more warning than would have been
given the last wiper taken on at the
roundhouse monteiths invalid wife
had recently died and he had saved a
little money

  loss of work and failing sight had
turned the old mans brain-and per-
haps some additional trouble had much
to do with his present condition it was
well known that james e serrill had
other occasion for disliking old jake
monteith and that monteith had not lost
his job entirely because of defective
vision

  the policemen knew the old man
but at times he was dangerous and they
dared take no risks having no hand-
cuffs with them they borrowed a rope
and bound the insane mans arms to his
sides

  he did not struggle until they had him
tightly triced and endeavored to urge
him toward the police station he
looked at them with a calm and confi-
dent smile
drift of the white crow



   see   he cried aloud  ropes will
not hold me behold-a miracle and
putting forth the enormous strength
engendered by his condition he actually
snapped his bonds

  the crowd fell back with exclama-
tions of wonder and fear

  the madman bounded to the other side
of the road but stopped suddenly in his
flight

  coming down the street and walking
briskly swinging his heavy cane ap-
peared james e serrill

  the madman halted him with up-
raised arms and a torrent of curses
poured from his lips his face blazed
with passion his lips were foam-flecked
in this spasm of demoniacal rage

  there was not a doubt of the super-
intendents peril he sprang away
to escape the madmans attack and
monteith followed him

  the policemen having been joined
by two more hurried to secure their
prisoner but as monteith flung himself
at serrills throat serrill side-stepped
and brought the heavy knob of the cane
on the madmans crown

  the blow felled the old man the blood
running in a stream upon the pavement
and the police held and tied him again

  some of the bystanders gathered about
the super to congratulate him on his
escape but serrill quickly got away
from them he passed tom drift with-
out a glance the engineer saw that the
railroad official was greatly moved by his
encounter with the madman

  at the first corner drift being right
on his heels the superintendent of the
big boulder division was again halted
on the walk a woman with a shawl
over her head which half shrouded her
features stood in his path

   where is he drift heard her cry
 if any harm comes to my father i
know it will be through you jim serrill
have you seen him

  drift halted too he recognized
maria monteith old jacobs daughter
the engineer shrank from telling her
himself what had befallen the half-blind
old man who had escaped her guar-
dianship

  serrill was not abashed however

   yes he said  i call tell you
theyre taking him to the police station
and if i have any influence with the

courts he shall be sent to the insane hos-
pital-where he should have gone long
ago he attacked me and i knocked
him down 

  he said it cruelly and with the evi-
dent satisfaction of giving her pain the
girl uttered a stifled cry and then stepped
close to the superintendent saying some-
thing in so low a tone that drift did
not hear

  serrill uttered an oath and half raised
his cane as if to strike her-and per-
haps he would have done so had not
somebody intervened

  they stood close to the door of the
boiler-room the passage between the
shops was empty but out of the boiler-
room door there stepped a begrimed
man in the dress of a fireman one
stride brought him between the girl and
the railroad superintendent

  he was a heavy featured chap with
rather dull eyes and coarse black hair
which hung low upon his smutty fore-
head he was below the middle height
but possessed long arms and a lusty body
drift knew him to be budd phelps a
fireman in the shops

   super he said speaking as though
he had not noted the officials action and
without as much as looking at maria
monteith  i got to show you something
t was just cleanin up for the night and
im glad you come along

  serrill recovered himself

   all right budd all right he said
and turning his back on the girl
followed the fireman inside

  drift went on toward the railroad
yard the girl stood undecided before
the fire-room door and the young engi-
neer seeing her face more plainly was
fairly startled by her expression pier
gaze followed the departing superin-
tendent- it was a blinding glance of
hatred

   james e serrill has an enemy
there thought drift  and shes got
good reason for hating him if all tales
are true

  the young engineer caught the rear
of the dog-house behind the evening
freight just then steaming out of the
yard and dropped off at hallett
crossing the cottage over which
milly presided as a brisk little housewife
was at hand

  he sat in the kitchen after supper


railroad mans magazine

listening to his sisters chatter as she
washed the dishes and tidied up the
already speckless room trying in his
own mind to put the fact of his dis-
charge and the change that must come
to them thereby into the gentlest
phrases

  there came a sudden rap  the door
milly ran in response

   why its anse  she cried  come
in mr prendergast how came you
way up here  

   no no miss milly said the old
man leaning against the door-frame as
sheepish as a boy  i cant stop i
come after your brother miss

  oh dear its more night runs i
know i do wish the super would give
you regular hours again tom

  drift picked up his cap and went to
the door wonderingly old anse was
saying

    reckon hell have a regular run
after this miss milly hes called to
take out the night express liell come
back  the white crow to-morrow-
where he belongs

   oh goody  cried the girl clapping
her hands

 whats this mean anse de-
manded drift disturbed

  but anse waited until the door was
closed he said

   its all right son i come up myself
with orders for ye ive had smith get
out a hand-car for us to go down on
youll be in time

  to take out the express theres
plenty of time besides-i dont know
as ifl do it anse

   you come down with me anyway
said the old man earnestly

   what for

   they want to see you

   but serrill discharged me-

   now son dont act the baby dont
be a fool i told him you could be de-
pended on

 told who

   ballington serrill

   huh  wheres the super 

  anse turned on him put a hand on
either shoulder and leaning forward
looked searchingly into tom drifts eyes
they were now within the radiance of
the crossing lamps

   the super is dead tom he was
murdered not two hours ago below

there at the shops ballington serrill is
in charge of the division now

chapter iii

       the finger of suspicion

vfans mind is a strange machine

       a fact put into it sometimes comes
out strangely distorted by memory

  somewhere in the course of omniv-
orous reading tom drift had come
across a similar situation

  a quarrel between employer and em-
ployee  bitterness and rancor on both
sides then the death of the employer and
the finger of suspicion-

   where was he murdered   he
asked in a voice which surprised him-
self it was so unshaken and natural

  inwardly he was trembling on the
surface there was nothing to excite
prendergasts comment

   in the fire-room of the shops said
prendergast in reply

  how was it done

   they dunno yet tom taint over
two hours ago that he was seen alive
 right after the arrest of jake
monteith  

   did you know about that  

   i was there

   wal and the old man turned from
him hastily as the agent at crossing sta-
tion pumped the hand-car alongside of
them  dont tell anybody that
eh queried drift

   better know nothin thats my
motto in law its ginerly the witness
that gets it in the neck wuss nor the
culprit

   what do you mean   demanded
drift looking anse in the eye

  he feared to see there an accusation
and his first thought was to boldly con-
front it-to stare it down the old man
evidently understood him

   look here tom drift he growled
 youve got a soft heart dont let it
extend to ver head nobodys accusin
you of havin anything to do with the
supers taking off you was home
warnt you  

   how should i know  queried drift
as he stepped upon the hand-car

prendergast followed him and they
let the car rumble down the grade

by and by the young engineer asked
drift of the white crow



  tell me how it happened

   thats what captain stranahan is
trving to find out

   oh 

   hell ask you some questions its
likely he did me theyre examining
everybody who spoke to the old man
this afternoon or who saw him it
seems a plumb mysterious thing

   the watchman found him stretched
out there in the boiler-room of the shops
there warnt a soul near and he was
dead all right

   how was he killed  asked drift

   thats what theyd like to find out
havent found anything but a bruise or
two which he might have got when he
fell it wasnt long after the shops shut
down that it happened hed been dead
some time when they found him and it
warnt moren eight oclock

   maybe theyll never learn who did
it breathed the young man more to
himself than to anse

   huh dont you believe that de-
clared the old fellow murder will
always out-like sap in a pine knot in
this case it looks like an easy one
surely somebody seen the murderer
whoever he was theyll nab him quick
enough but itll be a long day before
the big boulder gets a boss thatll keep
the repair expense account down like
james e serrill did

   it was that desire on his part that
caused the accident to the white crow
this afternoon grunted drift

   well let that fly stick on the wall
the mans dead said old anse  and
you take my advice tom drift don t
appear to know too much about him or
his end capn stranahan didnt larn
much from me you bet 

  prendergasts words buzzed in drifts
ears when he left the hand-car and
crossed the yard to the station some-
body must have seen the murderer

  before the young engineers mental
vision rose the figure of budd phelps as
lie invited the super into the boiler-room
during the altercation between serrill
and the daughter of jake monteith to
show him something

  budd had long been a neighbor of the
monteiths he was seemingly a stupid
fellow but he had worshiped maria
monteith long before that unhappy girl
took the step which had embittered her

own life and perhaps wrecked her
fathers mind

  after she had returned home to care
for her father budd had treated her
just the same as before and his dumb
devotion was pathetic

  the fireman must have known the
influence james e serrill had had upon
the unfortunate maria and drift had
seen the fireman and the super disappear
together into the boiler-room

  but he retained control of his features
and followed old anse up-stairs to the
division offices ballington serrill his
young face stern and white sat talking
with the chief of logan citys police
force

   i got him for you mr serrill old
anse said if youll excuse me-

   all right prendergast-all right
said young serrill shortly  im obliged
to you you can go then to drift
 i wanted to see you mr drift and
captain stranahan may have some ques-
tions to ask you youve heard of this
terrible happening

   ive heard that the superintendent is
dead-yes sir

   my poor uncle was killed i believe
by some enemy-although the doctors
as yet cannot state what actually caused
his death now captain stranahan 
ballingtons manner was nervous he
eyed drift aslant but the young engi-
neer was on guard

   i merely wish to ask mr drift
when and where he last saw james ser-
rill said the police officer slowly

   er-well first of all said balling-
ton hastily  let me learn if mr drift
is in the mood to take out the night
express this is important you
understand drift that you will be re-
instated and will have your old run-
the one parsons has been having do
you accept  

   certainly said drift promptly
mr drift was discharged then
asked stranahan

  he seemed not to look at the engineer
but the latters expression of counte-
nance did not change

   a mistake declared ballington
with the same haste  i tried to get him
to reconsider it this afternoon i am
glad to welcome him back on the big
boulder division and he spoke with
much emphasis


raturoad mans magazine

  stranahan nodded and said nothing
the new superintendent seemed to be
the only nervous persons in the room
he continued

   your old fireman has gone to the
hospital drift i shall have to give you
a new man on  he applied for a
change from the shops a month ago and
this seems a good chance for him here
he is now

  drift glanced quickly toward the door
somehow the appearance of budd
phelps did not startle him the fire-
man slouched forward in his dull way

  ive sent for you phelps young
serrill said  to give you a run with mr
drift youll go out on the express to-
night

   thank you sir

   and captain stranahan he waived
his hand lightly toward the police officer
 would like to talk with you too
ballington was recovering from his
confusion this was evidently a strained
situation for him too

  drift had taken a chair he believed
that he and phelps had been summoned
to the office for a purpose he steeled
himself to show neither surprise nor
fear whatever should happen

  as for budd phelps he looked upon
stranahan with a bovine gaze and said
nothing

   you saw the unfortunate mr serrill
just before his death i understand
asked the policeman

   i reckon so sir

   where was this  

   in the boiler-room lie was talking
to me t was showing him how we
needed a new compressed air-cock the
super was close about repairs sir and
his gaze flickered for a moment  bal-
lington  we couldnt get nothing new
through the foreman

  how did he seem asked strana-
han his gaze anywhere but  budd

   who-the super  

   yes

 i guess i hit him at a bad time he
damned me-and the cock i left him
looking at it just then gid larrabee
called me for it was after six oclock
the police officer nodded

  t went with gid to meehans
saloon

   you left mr serrill in the boiler-
room  

   thats what  said sir

   did you see anybody else around the
place 

  phelpss eye flickered for an instant
in drifts direction but he said without
the least hesitation

   not a soul sir-not a soul but gid
 all right phelps you can go said
stranahan dismissing him

   you can go over to the roundhouse
phelps and look over  no  will
be in the shops for a day or two yet
the fireman withdrew ballington
looked again at captain stranahan

   now for you mr drift said the
policeman taking the signal  you did
not see the superintendent later than
phelps i suppose  

   no sir

 you may be called upon to say some-
thing at the inquest perhaps id bet-
ter not ask you too many questions now
 i do not see- said drift begin-
ning hastily and then stopped

  you do not see what mr drift
said stranahan briskly

   i do not see what connection i can
be supposed to have with the matter

    dont suppose that you have said
the policeman with an expression of
great frankness  but you were seen
near the superintendent just after that
little fracas on the street when he
knocked that crazy man down every-
body remotely connected with the inci-
dent is being questioned

   w hat was done with poor mon-
teith asked ballington serrill quickly

   he raved so that we immediately
sent for the hospital ambulance and they
took him away said the chief of police
then he turned again to drift

   you see mr drift there may have
been no murder after all mr serrills
death may have been caused by apoplexy
there are  marks on the body-that
is  marks to show that he was at-
tacked

  when drift was outside he reviewed
the scene in the superintendents office
with frowning brow he knew that
there were suspicions in the minds
of ballington serrill and captain
stranahan

  were those suspicions aimed at him 
were they aimed at phelps

  he and budd had been brought into
the office together for a purpose
drift of the white crow



  how much did stranahan and the new
superintendent know of the truth and
how much did they suspect

   they are groping for a motive for
the crime-and a crime has been
committed despite stranahans final
comment thought drift  that talk
of apoplexy and the like is all bosh

   there must be other witnesses who
have connected phelps or me with the
murder old prendergast acted funny

   but  believe i can prove an alibi
the crew of the freight will remember
that i went up with them to the crossing
serrill must have been killed after that-
hold on perhaps not or perhaps
they can never establish the exact time
of his death

  he stood still in the darkness and
thought a chill of apprehension seized
him he could not shake off its grip

   perhaps the super was already dead
when i boarded the freight he may
have been struck down immediately after
he and phelps stepped into the boiler-
room

  the thought was forced upon him it
brought to the surface again that which
he had been trying to stifle

  james e serrill had knocked down
take monteith had threatened his daugh-
ter-whom the dead man had already
injured and therefore hated-and budd
phelps had stepped between the angry
man and his victim as drift passed by

  phelps himself had admitted that he
was alone with the superintendent in the
boiler-room gid larrabee had called
him from outside

  the only possible witness of what
occurred between the fireman anti the
man now so strangely dead was maria
monteith drift wondered if strana-
han had questioned the mad engineers
daughter 

  these facts pointed to one result-
and to one man serrill had injured
maria monteith phelps loved the girl-
even after she had been cast off by the
superintendent

  drift believed budd phelps guilty of
the murder

  it was an awful thing drift felt
the sweat standing on his brow and limbs
and he shook as though with an ague

  suppose he was called as a witness
suppose suspicion was already fastened
on poor budd and an attempt would be

made to prove through his testimony
that the fireman was the murderer

  hounded by these two fears-first
that he might himself be suspected of
the murder second that his evidence
might be needed to entangle phelps-
drift proceeded down the yard

  there were many flaring lights and
much running to and fro at the round-
house when he drew nearer he found
that the  had been derailed on her way
to the repair shop and the men getting
out ior-which he was to drive

  fortunately all the wrecking crew had
not gone and the great crane on its flat
car was particularly hand the boss of
the gang wished to use this huge machine
in getting the derailed locomotive back
 the track

  haste was imperative for the western-
bound night express - the train drift
expected to pull out with iot-would
soon steam into the station

  drift put aside the thoughts which
had been troubling him and went to the
aid of the wreckers he mounted to the
top of the boiler of the damaged loco-
motive and secured the sling that had
been carried under the machine

  this sling must be hooked by the arm
of the crane which could lift a hundred
tons as easily as drift could raise a ten-
pound dumb-bell

  in the noise of escaping steam from
several locomotives drift did not hear
the starting of the donkey that controlled
the crane and his back was toward the
swinging arm in a half-stooping pos-
ture clinging to the chains he first heard
the frightened shouts of those on the
ground who saw his peril

  drift straightened up-still uncon-
scious of trouble-and glanced over his
shoulder the huge arm of the crane
was almost upon him if he was struck
by that mass of steel he would be
crushed like a shell

  he could not climb down he must
jump thought is quicker than the
lightnings flash

  on the ground beside the derailed
locomotive was a tangle of rails and iron
work and it was twenty feet below him
to leap seemed certain injury-perhaps
death

  and in that flash of hesitation a voice
rose above the horrified shouts of the
workmen

 jump jump tom drift jump
for your life 

  drift saw a man bound across the
intervening tracks and plant himself
just beneath him holding up his arms to
catch the engineer then the engineer
leaped feeling the breath of the swing-
ing crane-arm on his cheek as lie did so

  he crashed into the arms of the man
below and they went to the ground to-
gether it was a mercy the under man
was not badly injured but he was first
on his feet and helped tom drift to rise

   that was a near call sir he said
and the breathless engineer looked won-
deringly into the countenance of budd
phelps

  it was the first thought drift had as

he arose

   i cant testify against this man hes
saved my life i must keep my mouth
shut

  he gave phelps his hand involun-
tarily

   thats all right mr drift youd
ha done as much for me said the fire-
man simply

  there seemed nothing more to say
the work of getting the derailed loco-
motive back on the track was continued
so toi could be pulled out

  meanwhile drift had given the ma-
chine he was to run a searching
inspection notwithstanding the fact
that budd phelps had never been a
tallow-pot the machine had been per-
fectly groomed and oiled drift could
find  fault

  the train from the east came into
the logan city terminal on time and
they backed  down to the station
and she was coupled on the  was
not like his own old  and drift did
not know what he could do with her-
or with the train she was to pull

  what his engine could do or what
budd phelps could do as stoker did not
hold first place in tom drifts thoughts
however and he wondered what was up-
permost in the mind of his fireman

  the starting gong sounded and drift
opened the throttle gently the tail of
cars moved easily glancing back along
the platform the engineer saw balling-
ton serrill watching their departure the
sudden death of the super had dropped
a heavy mantle of responsibility on the
young man

  there was not a flicker of expression
on serrills face as he saw drift at the
window of the cab but drift as he
drew in his head was sure that the new
superintendents mind was fixed on him

  the engineers own gaze sought the
stooping figure of the dwarflike budd
who had now dropped the bell-cord and
was breaking coal in the gangway

  was it a fact that he was riding in this
locomotive-cab with the murderer of
janies e serrill

chapter iv
 that fellows sister

r allington serrill had his
uncle to thank for his rapid
advancement in the employ of the
northwestern and pacific that fact
had really been the only tie save that
of blood between the dead superintend-
ent of the big boulder division and his
efficient assistant

  ballington knew and disapproved of
the private life of james e unlike tom
drift he would likely have dodged the
issue if sara longstreet had come to
him with questions regarding the rumor
of janies e serrills entanglement with
the daughter of poor blind jake m-
teith

  but then ballington had not known
miss longstreet all her life as drift had

  therefore the younger serrill was
well aware of the basis of the trouble
between his uncle and the engineer and
knowing there had been this bitter quar-
rel ballington was the more troubled
by the story of captain stranahan that
drift and the dead man had  quarreled
over a woman

   guess we wont say who the woman
is shes pretty well up in society the
policeman said

   i dont think it wise to mention her
name-no said ballington shortly

  but youre jumping at conclusions
youve got no proof

   ive got no proof that mr serrill
was murdered-yet said stranahan

  but ive got my suspicions he had
enough enemies god knows there is
another set of clues pointing to quite a
different party and about another
woman

  ballington serrill flushed   know
drift of the white crow



that my uncle was mixed up with some
mountain girl-

   married her sir-married her no
doubt of it he must have been drunk
at the time though twas no more than
he should have done she was decent
enough till he got her away from home
she lived in a house he hired over in my
district for a while you see he fell in
with her when he first came up here to
boss the straightening of the big boul-
der everybody knows about it

   what has that to do with the death
of my uncle  queried ballington

 nothing but theres a fellow-
and then he told his suspicions re-
garding budd phelps result the con-
fronting of the engineer and fireman as
previously shown

  but nothing came of it at least strana-
han would not admit he had made
anything by the examination of drift
and budd phelps as for ballington
serrill he felt ashamed of his part in
the affair

  he went down to see the night express
start with drift at the throttle of 
half tempted to say something to the
young engineer but there was phelps
within hearing and the acting super-
intendent merely stood and watched the
express pull out

  as the last car rolled by and he
turned back toward the street he ob-
served a womans figure hurrying
through the already scattering crowd

   miss longstreet  ejaculated bal-
lington confronting this lady

  so i just missed him she ex-
claimed breathless

 she gave him her hand and her
hurried excited manner assured serrill
that she was here unattended

  she was a tall gracefully formed girl
quite as old as serrill himself and he
was still under twenty-five she had an
air of assurance and a freedom of
manner which he had never exactly un-
derstood the breeziness of this west-
ern girl which no seminary polish could
hide did not appeal to him

  who did you look for lie asked
slowly  surely you were not going on
that train  

  although her face was in smiles he
saw something beside mere welcome in
her full dark eyes they looked
troubled

  her sweeping gown she had caught up
with one hand but it was mostly cov-
ered by the long silk garment she wore
over it

   i am on my way to the scotts
affair she said  but i was desirous
of speaking with mr drift milly
telephoned me that he was taking out
the express to-night

   the express has gone miss long-
street said ballington gravely

   so i am too late  however she
could not continue that forced lightness
of speech  he-he really is on that
train mr serrill she asked in some
anxiety

   mr drift certainly is in the cab of
ior pulling the night express to big
boulder declared the acting superin-
tendent in some wonder

   one hears so many garbled stories-
rumor flies so fast in this town she
sighed but the relief in her face was
plain enough

   you have heard of this terrible
tragedy miss longstreet  he ventured

 your uncle yes she looked
earnestly at him  is-is it true  it
has come to my ears that mr serrill
was-was murdered

  we fear so admitted ballington
 but the coroner has not learned how it
was done

   but there is no doubt that he was
killed   she cried

   i say we fear so said ballington
doggedly

   but my mothers maid came to us
with the name of the man they think
did it

   then she knows what nobody else
knows declared the acting superintend-
ent with some surprise

   i-i feared he bad been arrested
of course it could not be true you
know whom i mean mr serrill

  he could not deny it  you are
thinking of mr drift 

   yes tom drift i know that he
and your uncle quarreled my fooli-li
mother told your uncle that tom had
undermined him with me it did tom
harm

   i know nothing about that miss
longstreet said ballington stiffly

  her frankness seemed crude to him
he could not understand a young lady
speaking so plainly


railroad mans magazine

  if anybody is wicked enough to be-
lieve tom drift capable of committing
a crime-such a crime said the girl
earnestly  i want you to know that all
 have--all the fortune i own-is at his
disposal for defense i will go bail for
him to any amount-if bail is obtainable
and his sister milly would go mad if
anything happened to tom

  ah his sister - yes murmured
ballington serrill

   you have met milly mr serrill
she was visiting me once when you
callled you remember what a dear girl
she is

  ballington had a vivid remembrance
of tom drifts sister a fluffy-haired
sweet and childlike figure low toned and
gentle much different from the aggres-
sive miss longstreet

   think how milly will suffer if this
story about tom is circulated i got
her on the phone the moment mother
told me the story she knows nothing
about it yet

   it is an idle tale i believe said
ballington huskily it is true that
drift and my uncle did not get on well-
in fact drift was discharged this after-
noon

   oh 

   but i have reinstated him and he has
been given his old run again-the night
express to big boulder and the white
crow return

   oh thank you  cried sara her
face lighting up  that act tells me
better than words what you think of
such a preposterous accusation but you
know mother she is very very unfair
at times and she never liked tom

   i would net worry about it miss
longstreet he said trying to speak
cheerfully

   thank you i must run back to the
carriage now mother will be quite
horrified by my stay as it is

  she disappeared serrill walked
moodily out of the station

  if anything happened to drift that
young lady would suffer keenly he
thought  but how about the fellows
sister such a pretty little thing 

  he said it tenderly a vision of
drifts sister rose before his eye  no
she would suffer the most if drift got
into trouble over this thing poor
milly

  he went  as lie intended to the
undertakers rooms to which the body
of james e serrill had been removed
the physicians had just finished with
their autopsy and their report threw
little upon the mystery of the mans
death

  apoplexy was impossible james e
serrill had died of no known disease

  although there were only superficial
bruises-notably on the  back and
shoulders-the doctors declared that
death had been brought about by sonic
violent blow which had ruptured his
heart

  the blow had been delivered on the
front of the victims body yet the flesh
there was not bruised-only reddened
his clothing had not been disarranged
nothing had been removed from his
pockets

  it was as though some giant fist had
smote him and left him lying there in
the boiler-room of the shops nothing
else but that he was dead and had died
instantly was really known

  dazed by the seemingly deepened
mystery ballington serrill went to cap-
tain stranahan again late as the hour
was

  the police had searched the scene of
the tragedy minutely the fireman
before leaving had cleaned up and made
everything orderly for the night not
a tool was out of place the fires had
been drawn and the ashes wheeled out
everything-even to the fire-hose and
the air-pipes coiled in their frames 
the walls-was as it should be

  the night watchman coming in had
found the body of the unfortunate super
lying against the north wall as though
it had been flung there by the force of
the blow which had killed him

 murder had been committed by
whom or how stranahan and his assist-
ants were not prepared to suggest

   but well get the fellow-soon de-
clared the confident chief of police

   i sincerely hope so ballington
remarked as he started for his hotel

  but did he mean it he thought of
the little girl up on the mountainside at
allett crossing what would become
of her if tom drift was proven guilty

   a gruesome thought  muttered
ballington serrill  w hy he rather than
budd phelps
drift of the white crow



  his mind was with the two men in
the cab of  shrieking across the pioco
range and down into the valley beyond
the mountain wall into big boulder the
terminus of their run

  if either of them is guilty i hope
he does not come back was the final
thought of the acting superintendent

chapter v
in the canon

npom drift on this night that the
superintendent of the big boulder
division had been so mysteriously struck
down was hampered by a lack of knowl-
edge of his engine as well as a doubt re-
garding the capabilities of his stoker

  but like the practical fellow he was
he began studying both before passing
logan city yard

  the  charged the grade pluckily
the string of cars was a long one but
the big mountain creeper steamed easily

  as for budd phelps he went about
his business with some appearance of
knowing his duties plainly this was not
his first experience in the gangway

  lp and up the train climbed past the
darkened stations which now and then
were set down on the wooded mountain-
side the grade was not steep all the
way there were plateaus on which were
settlements of some size

  they crossed the steel trestle over the
big boulder with thunderous roar be-
low the tumbling waters flashed white

  across the basin ahead far far in the
distance the engineer could see the glow
of the electric lights on the clouds above
big boulder city

  down the western skirt of the saddle
the train shot and dashed along the
floor of the basin where the noisy river
spread out into a series of placid lakes
on either side of the right-of-way

  for miles the rails were laid on
trestles this route was the more direct
it had been built since the northwestern
and pacific system had taken over the
big boulder division

  the waters of the lakes lapped the
trestles but the underpinning seemed to
be secure the train passed over the
water for several miles-and in time of
storm drift had known the waves to
wash completely across the tracks

  just now however the young engineer
had little thought for anything but the
time he was making and the humors of
no  he knew how to coax along
old  and get the best there was out of
her but he brought the express into big
boulder that morning ten minutes late

  during the long trip from logan city
the fireman had scarcely spoken but that
seemed to be only his usual manner if
he were guilty of the murder of james e
serrill he appeared serene

   if lies guilty nows his time to get
away thought drift

  he wondered if lie would have to put
in a call for another fireman for the re-
turn trip meanwhile he went to a
house he had previously patronized and
went to bed he could be pretty sure of
four hours  the hay in big boulder
each forenoon

  when he was called to take out the
white crow he went down to the round-
house where the freshly groomed 
stood budd phelps was there

  is he a fool or is he innocent
doubted tom drift  if he goes back to
logan theyll jug him sure 

  he could not speak to phelps about
the murder however had he done so
drift feared that he would have shown
by his manner whom he suspected

  the flier came in from the west 
time and the engine that had pulled her
rolled panting down to the roundhouse
like a spent racehorse her eagle-eye
leaned out of the cab window and shout-
ed to drift

   hi tom i hear youve got back
your old run good luck to you boy
shes on the notch here see how much
you can lose getting her over the saddle
but drift was determined not to lose
time if he could help he had studied
no  coming over and a daylight
run and clear track would make the trip
east much less difficult

  the white crow was made up of a
baggage and express-coach a day-coach
and smoker three pullmans and an ob-
servation-car it was a light train and
although after crossing the basin the
rails climbed several steep grades in get-
ting over the saddle  the eastern side
of the range it was an easy slide down
into logan city

  this run between big boulder and the
eastern terminal of the division was one


railroad mans magazine

of the fastest on the whole n and p
system and this same white crow flier
went from end to end of the n and p

  plie  needed no coaxing across the
flats of the basin and over the bright
waters of the chain of lakes into which
the roaring big boulder emptied but as
the big locomotive bucked the first grade
budd phelps began to get busy

   shes a hog for diamonds budd
said tom drift

  the dwarflike stoker lent to the task

 they struck mad horse canon
wherein the rails followed the river for
some miles without crossing it and
drift had held her to the time the
canon as far as the road followed it was
as straight as an arrow but before the
rails crossed the boiling river by trestle
and entered the break in its eastern wall
the right-of-way curved around the west
side of that basin in the hills known as
the big squaws cooking pot

  elsewhere the canon was narrow with
towering walls

  through the narrow channel the river
roared its spray dashing at times across
the rails and to-day the flood was
particularly high there had been heavy
rains in the hills for several days and
now black clouds overhung the peaks
and even the saddle

  as tom drift leaned from his cab he
saw the lightning playing in the drab-
edged clouds above the peaks like trout
jumping in a mountain lake the
heavens seemed to have settled down
upon the heights the clouds heavy with
rain threatening to engulf the whole
range

   it will be tough in this canon before
night muttered drift

  scarcely had his lips formed the mut-
tered words when a puff of smoke or
steam seemed to fill the head of the
canon beyond the cooking pot toward
which the train was hurrying and a
sound as of a mighty wind beat down
the clash and rattle of the machinery

  the cloud rolled down upon them
with terrific swiftness budd looking
from the other side of the gangway ut-
tered a shrill yell

  a cloudburst see that drift

  the engineer could not fail to see the
threatening wall of water which higher
than the stack of the  was charging

                       to be

 down the canon and he understood the
 peril quite as quickly as the fireman

   there had been a cloudburst in the
 range

   thousands of tons of water had
 poured down gullies and courses drain-
 ing the bald crowns of the mountains
 and these estuaries emptying into the
 bed of the big boulder had suddenly
 swelled that stream to enormous propor-
 tions

   what had at first seemed to be smoke
 was - within the few seconds - trans-
 formed into a white wall of water the
 crest of which curled like a tidal wave
 high above the usual level of the big
 boulder

    it swept the canon from wall to wall
 bearing down upon the flying train so
 swiftly that it was plain to both the
 eagle-eye and the fireman that to reverse
 the locomotive and try to escape by run-
 ning back out of the canon would be a
 useless proceeding

   drift glanced at budd phelps the
 firemans face was white his eyes glit-
 tered but he seized his shovel with an
 unshaken demeanor

   the engineer pointed ahead the roar
 of the approaching avalanche of water
 drowned all speech budd nodded

   instantly drift let her out to the
 last notch while budd began feeding the
 furnace like mad

   both men in the cab saw that retreat
 was useless they caught at the single
 straw of hope that came within their
 reach

    if the flier could reach the circular
 pocket in the canon the squaws cook-
 ing pot before the flood caught her in
 the narrow part of the canon the water
 might be so spread out and reduced in
 depth that the cars would remain on the
 rails while the flood swept past

   the cooking pot was not far ahead
 but the rushing water had almost
 reached this basin

   so imminent a catastrophe would have
 shaken the bravest soul fom drift felt
 the responsibility of the train and its
 passengers in his heart and on his mind

   death bore down upon him-death in
 a most terrible form but he charged
 the wall of water with his hand gripping
 the throttle -a hand that showed no
 tremor

how cooney made the border

         by edward t glynn

            it was a lucky shot all right thought the
            bandit as he took shanks mare for the open

hen do i ly dagger
 glanced up and recog-
 nized in the tall lean
 uncouth stranger who
 had just stepped into
 view around the corner
 of the cabin cooney the outlaw - the
 very man whom her husband sheriff jim
 daggert was just then searching for out
  among the foothills-she dropped her
 hands gasped a little frightened cry and
 started up from the low wooden bench

     as she did a glint of steel flashed sud-
  denly from cooneys hip and a shot
  buzzed downward and pretty close to her
  head a moment later as she straight-

ened ui speechless and trembling
cooney bolstering his  stepped for-
ward smiling

   jumpin jehosaphat maam but yuh
almost queered the best shot i ever
made he said in an easy drawl  yuh-
huh maam he continued smilingly
that shot come so near taking off the
wrong head my bones are rattlin yet
there he was the varmint all coiled up
ready to strike when up yuh jumps right
plumb in the way  thought youd get
it first-right where be got it hisself-
squar in the gullet

  the newcomer gave a little indicative
nod and dolly turning slowly compre-


railroad maxs magazine

liended the situation in one quick horri-
fied glance

  just behind her its chubby hands
dabbing at its half-opened eyes was a
baby thrashing about just a foot or
so beyond was the headless body of a
rattlesnake near by was a cluster of
rocks from which the snake presumably
had ventured

  with a little cry dolly ran to the child
snatched it up and pressed il against her
bosom mumbling motherly words in
self-reproach

  the outlaw still smiling crossed over
buried the toe of a heavy boot under the
snakes belly and kicked it back among
the rocks when lie faced about he
grinned placidly into dollys wondering
but grateful countenance

   thats all right maam he drawled
knowingly  yuli neednt bother nriu
to thank me-none at all first place
its mebbe i aint worth it second
place yuh wouldnt do it nohow case
yuh knew my name bein so just sup-
pose yuh get us a feed and well call it a
bet that little shot maam i made on
an empty stomach

  as he paused his leering grin still
fastened insolently on her face dolly
conscious of something else besides hu-
mor in his words shifted the child in her
arms hesitated a moment and then
walked toward the cabin

   all right she said simply  come
inside

  the outlaw awaiting no further invi-
tation followed dolly leading they en-
tered a big low-ceiled room that occu-
pied most of the ground floor of the
cabin

  once inside the outlaw seated himself
at a table built against a wall near a
window slouching forward on his el-
bows his revolver within easy reach he
at once opened up a conversation dolly
deigning just the briefest of replies
placed the child in a crib and busied her-
self with the meal

  as she did so the outlaw watching
her through his slitlike eyes continued
his flippant remarks seemingly indiffer-
ent to the fact that most of them passed
unanswered once served however lie
lapsed into silence greedily devouring
the food placed before him

  every now and then he looked up to
scrutinize the trail or cast a curious

glance about the room the smile never
left his lips neither was it really good
to see < >nce or twice he ceased gorging
himself long enough to grin at the child
of dollys presence he appeared utterh
oblivious yet instinctivclv he was con-
scious of every move she made

  seated across the room she wrestled
with her thoughts as she coverth
watched him eat her face a stud of
swiftly changing expressions

  n the one hand prompted bv a
feeling of gratitude for his act in saving
her child from possible death she was
tempted to assist him-murderer though
she knew he was-in his race for the
mexican border for which place she
knew he was headed primarily for his
 health

  on the other hand however prompted
by thoughts of the si reward whicn
she knew was being offered for his ap-
prehension dead or alive she was just
as strongly tempted to hold him captive
until the return of her husband

  in a silence that rapidly became op-
pressive she pondered and her decision
was hastened by the recollection of a
promise which her husband the sheriff
liad made only that morning when start-
ing for the hills

   dolly dear  - the promise came
back to her word for word--  if i get
that cuss to-day you and me and the
kid gets that little ranch youve often
dreamed about ill chuck this job o
mine higher than a kite so high itll
never come down ill do that dolly
sos you wont need to worry  more
if lies out there girl im going to get
him dolly im a going to get that re-
ward for you and the babe

  yes she decided it was best-best for
all concerned-that she make this man a
captive after all she reasoned his act
in saving her child from possible death
notwithstanding he deserved but little if
any consideration

  was he not a murderer a thief an
acknowledged menace to society were
not his crimes which included some of
the blackest in the state unforgivable in
the eyes of law and man alike 

  moreover if allowed to go was it not
likely that lie would continue to the pos-
sible loss and sorrow of others under
the circumstances why then even out of
gratitude should she lei him go
how cooney made the border



  as one who weighs a final decision
dolly leaned forward in her chair and
watched the outlaw for some moments
as she did she gripped the -caliber re-
volver which unobserved she had
slipped into the capacious pocket of her
apron while preparing the meal a sem-
blance of a smile curled her bps as cov-
ertly she scrutinized her
gluttonous guest

  that her nerve was
equal to the task she had
in mind she did not doubt

dolly was born of cou-
rageous stock and reared
in a country where cour-
age was contagio  s

once she had the drop 
the outlaw an advantage
which she smilingly ob-
served would be easy to
obtain he would readily
capitulate

  her personal knowl-
edge of  bad  men as-
sured her that she was
right if he didnt sur-
render a possibility
which of course still re-
mained - dollys smile
changed to one of grim
resolution as mind made
up she moved to arise

  at that moment how-
ever the outlaw turning
unexpectedly startled her
back into her chair as
she caught her breath
wondering if lie had di-
vined her object he leered
at her as he spoke
holding out an empty cup

dolly breathed again in
evident relief

  hope yuh wont think
im a hog maam he
drawled  but could yuh draw us off
another mug of tea thisthirst o mine
sure makes me feel shamed of myself
--especially when im round where the
liquors scarce

  he allowed his grin to penetrate the
woman another brief instant then as
she hesitatingly rose he swept it toward
the child he winked ponderously as
the baby gripping the side of its crib
giggled in childish amusement at him

  yuh little rascal yuh he chided

good-naturedly so thats what yuh
think o me eii after what  did for yuh
-givin me the hoss-laugh

  at this remark dolly then reaching
for the outlaws cup suddenly experi-
enced a new emotion

  something about the scene that she
beheld just then-the hardened criminal

udn t even know the cuss was there i

shaking a ringer in playful reproof at the
cooing child-struck her as pitiful

   i a flash it occurred to her that after
all in plotting the outlaws capture she
was guilty of gross ingratitude in this
sudden reconsideration her heart filled
with motherly compassion all thoughts
of the badness in the man fleeing from
her mind

  with a little shudder of self-reproach
she pictured herself surrendering to the
law for a money reward-which she re-

stan p hack back to the wall i sie okdekel
how cooney made the border



luctantly admitted was her basic motive
-this man who without any considera-
tion for his own safety had protected
her child

  then as the full meaning of her con-
templated act dawned upon her - the
realization that his capture eventually
might mean his life - her face suddenly
lighted with new sympathy

  in another moment she turned away
from the scene which abruptly had
wrought a change in her mind walked
to the stove and filled the cup return-
ing she placed it beside the outlaws
plate

  a commiserating smile on her lips
she stood silently watching the renegade
who seemingly oblivious to all else was
still catering to the childs amusement
after a moment as though loath to in-
terrupt she spoke her voice softened by
a new note of solicitation

   is there anything more youd like
she asked  had enough - all you
want  

  the outlaw slowly turned in his chair
his eyes swept the scene of devastation
 the table before him lie met dollys
querulous eyes with a comical grin

   plenty maam he answered briefly
plenty just wanted this-he raised
the cup of tea- to slosh down thats
all

   aint room enough there lie pat-
ted his paunch with a knife  for a case
of indigestion besides i got to mooch
it right along

  lender his leering gaze dolly felt a
blush of resentment come suddenly to
her cheeks it quickly faded however
when the outlaw turning back toward
the table resumed his silent contempla-
tion of the trail

  for a moment dolly was absorbed in
meditation a new idea in mind she
then started across the room half-way
she paused turning toward the outlaw
again

   if you can wait she said question-
inglv  ill do you up some sandwiches
perhaps youll need them-if youre go-
ing far she added a bit grimly

   all right maam if yuh would
the outlaw spoke without turning
 fix em up with lots of mustard too
if yuh will he added  dont know
but what they would be handy come to
think of it case anything does happen

sos i cant stop off some place to-night
for supper

  at something in the outlaws sarcasm
dolly gave a little start if something
happened if something happened as
the words flashed back across her mind
her heart grew numb of a sudden her
thoughts went out to the hills to the
man among them to the husband the
father the sheriff trailing down this
selfsame outlaw-for her and the babe

  in a swiftly moving mental panorama
she pictured a scene that chilled her
blood-a scene that left her momentarily
dazed in the sudden realization that
should it prove an actuality she would
have to stand the blame it was a scene
wherein she saw the two men meet-the
outlaw and the sheriff-saw them blend
their fire and saw the sheriff fall

  w ith a new resolution in mind dolly
placed on a shelf a knife with which she
had just started to cut some bread
slipped her hand into the pocket of her
apron and slowly turned about

  a exclamation of mingled surprise
and alarm escaped her lips at the tableau
she beheld

  the outlaw partly standing was lean-
ing across the table his face against the
window except for the nervous twitch-
ing of the fingers closed about the handle
of his  his poise was ominously tense

  i the silence of the room dolly heard
muttered oaths oozing through his lips
her heart seemed to stop beating lest
he catch her cry with one quick com-
prehensive glance through the open door
she looked again at the outlaw smiled
grimly and drew her revolver

  as she stood with the weapon leveled
toward his head she cast another hasty
glance out  the trail down which part-
ly concealed in a cloud of dust galloped
a troop of horsemen

  	ne the sheriff was fully fifty yards
ahead of the others

  then glancing back at the outlaw
now straightening up the smile gone
from his lips she cleared her throat

  the command which she uttered rang
out like a pistol-shot in the stillness of
the room

   drop that gun  hands up  quick 
youre covered 

  with a startled oath the outlaw
wheeled around lashing the woman with
a look of mingled surprise and rage i
railroad maxs magazine

the one brief moment that he stood ir-
resolute his gaze lighting significantly
on the now sleeping child dolly her
heart pierced by a new and sudden fear
cocked the weapon

  prompted both by the warning click
and the resolute gleam in the womans
eyes the outlaw then let his  clatter
to the table and raised his hands

  as he did the corners of hi mouth
twisted into a malignant smile

   well maam i low youve caught
me foul all right all right couldnt
caught me better if id come here all tied
up like a birthday gift he paused a
moment then added in bitter self-de-
nunciation   shows what an ass  was
to waste my last shot like  did

  at this remark dollys expression sud-
denly changed through eyes closely
squinted she swiftly searched his face

   you-did-that she asked slowly

  a sneer replaced the outlaws smile

   well maam if i didnt yuh dont
suppose id be standing here like this
like a statue of liberty do yuh he
growled

  dolly her brain working rapidly
glanced quickly from the outlaw to the
trail then back to the outlaw again
the horsemen were now within two hun-
dred yards of the cabin their nearness
seemed to hurry her decision

   stand back-back to the wall  she
ordered suddenly moving toward the
table

  the outlaw obeyed fully surmising
her purpose

   if yuh think im a liar he said
 theres the old pea-shooter itself

  ignoring the remark dolly her pistol
still trained on the outlaw quickly
snatched his gun glanced hastily at the
empty chambers and then dropped the
weapon in the pocket of her apron with
another hasty glance outside she cried

  quick-into that closet quick be-
fore they come perhaps im a fool-
but ill give you a show  

  cooney blinking in wonderment ha-
stened to obey

  as the closet door shut softly behind
him dolly lowered her revolver smiled
reflectively and walked across the room
she appeared in the doorway of the
cabin just as the first of the horsemen
prepared to dismount

  she caught his eyes and signed him
back into the saddle

   jim youve missed your man by half
an hour she said calmly  get a wig-
gle on and youll catch him over there
in the hills to the east-unarmed

  at the wondering look in the sheriffs
face dolly stepped outside produced the
outlaws revolver and laughingly told a
story that alternately moved the sheriff
and his posse to smiles and oaths at
its conclusion the sheriff pulling his
horse around issued an order and the
posse galloped away

  a few minutes later when dolly re-
volver in hand again faced the outlaw
she spoke with a trace of mockery in her
tones

   you neednt thank me for this mr
cooney she said meeting his gaze with
a quiet smile  just thank yourself for
having done at least one good turn-one
for which im now doing you another

  she waited a moment then added in
tones of sudden finality  now then i
guess thats all i dont believe youd
better wait even for those sandwiches

 think youd better go right now in-
stead make west - the posses riding
east-and youll get away now-just
-mooch 

  an hour later as he made his way
to safety in the western hills cooney
was moved to merriment

   what makes me laugh he chuckled
half aloud  is that i didnt mean to get
that reptile at all didnt even know the
cuss was there  see the woman jump
sposed she had a gun and just let fly
offhand it was a lucky shot all right

why the  of the central of georgia railway is a  free steamer
the delight of the firemans heart

ic and weight of
have so greatly in-
igners and buildrs
denied the privilege
resorting to added
ncreased efficiency
imit in height and
width has been readied and even increased
length can scarcely be further possible

  this condition is prominent on the santa
fe baltimore and ohio delaware and
hudson and other reads where the enor-
mous mallets are in evidence a casual
view of the situation now clearly indicates
that the future development of the machine
must be within itself and not through the
addition of wheels and inches

better steaming qualities

  it was known of course to the far-see-
ing locomotive designers of ten years ago
that the limit in size must be reached some
day although few of them believed that
the day was close at hand nevertheless
more than one mechanical engineer and
superintendent of motive power went
quietly to work in anticipation of what the
future might bring forth

  the necessity for securing better or at
least more dependable steaming qualities
was quickly recognized but until a com-
paratively recent date such efforts were
confined to experiments with different
front-end arrangements stacks of varying
diameter and possibly every patented ex-
haust-pipe in the country was given a
trial

  considerable good materialized from
this research work and certain standards
became established where practically many
important details were at random and at
variance even between two connecting roads

  prominent among the successful at-
tempts to add what may be called additional
constitutional strength to tbe engines was
the development and large adoption of the
superheater owing to a peculiar property
it is possible to add to the heat of steam
after it has separated from the water from
which it was generated

  i f this superheated steam is thrown in
contact with a cooling surface such as the
cylinder the additional degrees of heat or
the superheat must first be dissipated be-

on seme roa

fore the usual condensation takes place
thus obtaining greater efficiency than can
be obtained from a given volume of satu-
rated steam c f the same pressure

  for a long time after the first super-
heaters were applied nothing like general
interest could be claimed for them but at
the present time there now seems to be a
general determination to superheat bv
wholesale as there was to compound some
years ago

  the next prominent feature in the line
t f development was the revival and now
very general use cf the brick arch in the
lire box which has for the end in view to
teay the unconsunied gases from reach-
ing the flues and escaping unburned until
i v would have ail opportunity to ignite
a marked gain in fuel economy results from
the installation of this device when prop-
erly applied and they have been greatly
improved over the original design

  in the  the new baldwin built
f r the central of georgia railway which

l	as been making a wonderful record for
fuel economy and general efficiency are
embodied other progressive ideas which
 doubt will prove as significant in results
as the appliances above mentioned

  the distinctive novelty embodied in this
engine is a plan to secure greater fire-box
volume and deflection of gases which per-
sonal experience of the motive power man-
agement of that road had convinced were
most important factors although hereto-
fore they had largely bsen lost sigh of

running with original flues

  a rather lengthy study of the whole mat-
ter resulted finally in a special design of
fire-box embodying the combustion cham-
ber brick wall with air inlets and means
for sparking the combustion chamber

  to check the theories in actual practise
an engine was changed by cutting off the
entire back-head and building another with
a fire-box the length of the brick wall plus
that of the combustion chamber longer than
it ordinarily would have been the com-
bustion chamber was formed by building
a brick wall  a cross-hearing when com-
pleted the engine was placed in service
this was over three years ago

the hues applied at that time have never
value

 iven any trouble from leaking
i r stopping up and although
twice in the shop for tire turn-
ing the engine is still running
with the original flues having
made over eighty thousand miles
on the same division sister en-
r ines as well as engines of equal
power in the same service fail
to make an average of over
twenty-six thousand to thirty-
three thousand miles before the
flues require safe-ending and
r setting

  another remarkable feature of
the entire remarkable perform-
ance is the fact that the flues
show no indication of plugging
up even though soft coal is
burned

  the foreman boilermaker of
th- terminal out of which the
engine runs makes the positive
statement that his locomotive
has never been reported to have
a hue blown out

  the engine is attracting much
attention at the present time as
a c utiuuation of this success
may result in the establishment
of new standards for fire-box
design which will rank equally
with the superheater and im-
proved brick arch in the promo-
tion of increased efficiency

  from the standpoint of the en-
gineer and fireman those actu-
ally charged with getting the
big locomotive over the road the
new design leaves nothing to be
desired the delight of the fire-
mans heart is a  free steamer
and this the  certainly is be-
cause the total absence of flic
and fire-box leaks coupled with
practical immunity from front-
end troubles insures that this
enviable condition will always
be present

  phe bugbear of the engineer
all over is the answering of que-
ries regarding engine failures
the majoritv el which result
from leaky flues or plugged net-
ting with the accompanying
loss of time but in this case the
 has failed to get a place on
the delay sheet since being placed
in service thus establishing an-
other record the greatest care
has been used in keeping the va-
rious records and there is 
question in regard to the accu-
racy of the statements

no  ok the central uk georgia railway built by thk baldwin locomotive works kylmlled with a kire-box area by which she

is expected to make a record in fuel economy
rons on skates is steered by a wheel and has no drivers

lumber hog just skates along

milks from the railroads the lumber-
jack with ax and saw fells the trees
that the mills convert into logs

  these trees must be transported to rail-
roads before they can he put lo any ii-- in
the summer if the forests are not too far
in the northland rivers and streams are
used to float millions of logs to points where
they can he shipped without great incon-
venience or delay but when winter grips
the waters then other means of moving
the lumber must be found

  one of the most expeditious means is a
curious locomotive that runs on metal treads
and runners resembling skates

  tlie locomotive is constructed very much
on the order of the usual logging-engine

	has no drivers

  the treads are constructed to undulate
and adapt themselves to the irregularities
of the surface of the ground the weight
of the locomotive creates the necessary ad-
hesion anil the treads moving slowly ahead
force the locomotive along on the skatelike
devices in front the engine is guided by

a steering-gear quite like that of the auto-
mobile and while the engineer is driving
the  helmsman as he is called occupies
the seat in front of the boiler-head and di-
rects its course it must seem strange in-
deed for these railroaders of the logging-
camps to operate their trackless roads with-
out board light or order

  a device of a very similar nature was
constructed for the british army a few years
ago after the boer war when england
suddenly realized how unprepared she had
been for war the anxiety to have the mili-
tary fully prepared for a subsequent strug-
gle was widespread throughout the empire

  english soldiers had suffered much owing
to the mountainous nature of the transvaal
much difficulty was experienced in hauling
artillery over the steep ascents to pre-
vent if possible a recurrence of this troub-
le an automobile intended to climb heavy
grades and move cannon was built this
grade-climbing auto was propelled by the
same sort of metal undulating treads that
are used on the skating engine

time between new  ork and chicago
must be considered in making up a time-
table and that an impatient public must
be educated to the difference between
twenty-two hours from new york to
chicago and twenty-four hours from
chicago to new york

  from the very earliest beginnings of
civilization the one measure of time
common to all people and to all nations
has been the day and later the year

  <	>ur whole fabric of civilization is
woven about the fact that the earth turns
over once in a certain time which we
have arbitrarily divided into twentv-four
divisions called hours but the time
which served our forefathers no longer
serves us-nor could serve us if we tried
to use it

  the beginning of our time measure-
ment is noon-that instant in time when
-

railroad mans magazine

at any place the sun is directly and ex-
actly overhead

  it is the time shown by the sun dial
which gave the earliest measurement of
time intervals less than the day

  the  day  which our forefathers di-
vided into twenty-four hours is supposed
to be the interval between noon and
noon as the sun can never be directly
overhead  more than one meridian at
a time it is obvious that noon occurs at
different times on all different meridians

  but with trains and watches and tele-

  scopes and real time determination
chaos came from this simple beginning
not only was  noon  later in one place
than another but the days were not all
the same length

  sometimes they were short and some-
times they were long a few minutes

  of course if such days were divided
into twenty-four hours sometimes the
hours and minutes would be longer than
at other times

   try the stars said an astronomer

  but the time between the passing or
 transits  of the same star
over the meridian of any
place is different by four min-
utes in the day from the suns
transit over the same place-
a difference that amounts to
one whole day in a year

   the reason is not difficult to
explain we go around the sun
as well as around our own
axis but we measure star
transits always from an object
infinitely distant

  there is a point in the
heavens called the vernal
equinox it is where the
equator crosses the elliptic
when that point passes across
our meridian we call it as-
tronomical or sidereal noon

   but as this sidereal  noon 
occurs at all hours of the day
and night it would not be very
satisfactory for daily use we
could not use it for trains and
meals and business

imagine a sun

the standard clock op the united states it is kept
in an air-tight case in an underground vault
at washington and is electrically wound
every thirty seconds

  now if we cannot keep
time by the sun because owing
to our motion around it actual
sun days are irregular in
length and the accurate si-
dereal day measured between
transits of the same star will
not do because it brings noon
or the starting point at all
sorts of impossible hours at
different times of the year
what are we to do

  it was quite a puzzle until
some one thought of a make-
believe sun very simple-like
the columbus egg trick

  we imagine a fictitious sun
now time is made



tweny six inch refractor used at the united states naval observatory washington
it brings the true time from the stars to the earth

or  mean  sun as it is callcd which has
the same apparent yearly motion as our
real sun but which has an even and well-
regulated movement giving us days and
nights which are all tlie same length and
hours and minutes which never vary

  you can see how easy this was to ac-
complish when all we had to do was to
imagine it

  the difference between  mean solar
time  or the time of the fictitious sun
and apparent solar time or the time
by the actual sun is never greater than
fifteen minutes so that we really are
living by the sun and not by a figment of
the imagination

  but those fifteen minutes would cause
the greatest kind of confusion if they
were not taken care of and obliterated
from our time measurements for in-
stance no watch which could be made
would run correctly if we did not have

our well-regulated fictitious sun by which
to run it

  this fictitious sun served us very well
until rapid transportation came into be-
ing it did not make much difference to
the man who traveled by stage-coach
from st louis to washington district
of columbia if on arriving at washing-
ton he had to set his watch ahead an
hour and a half

  it made  difference that every town
and hamlet had a different time from its
neighbors-the difference was small and
time was not of much value anyway
when it came down to minutes

  rut when trains began to run across
the country at high speed the time sys-
tem even with the fictitious sun became
unendurable

  even the practise of carrying the time
of large and important cities into the
smaller towns and hamlets within their


railroad mans magazine

sphere of influence resulted  confu-
sion

  thus should albany take its time
from rochester or from boston or
should it insist on a time of its own
should a railway train have to run three
schedules in a day or one schedule

  in a very short time with rival rail-
way systems each running on its own
time confusion became worse confound-
ed a city would have mean time rail-
way time solar time or local time and
perhaps a rival railway or two operating
on the local time of some other city

  t wenty-four standard time meridians

  when you said you were going away
at twelve oclock it might mean eleven
by your friends watch and twelve-
twenty-five by the clock on the city hall

  some sort of order had to be brought
out of the confusion and so in 
an international conference was called in
washington where the present standard
time-system was adopted

  in this system there are twenty-four
standard time meridians extending
around the globe each exactly one hour
different in time from the next one

  each meridian therefore is the center
of a time zone the inhabitants of that
time zone soon came to use zone time
instead of local time the maximum dif-
ference of which is half an hour and in-
stead of having many different times on
which trains are run we have only
standard time with certain definite places
at which to set our watches

  as every railroad man knows there
are in the united states four of these
zones eastern central mountain and
pacific in each as we travel west the
time is exactly one hour earlier than it
is in the zone immediately east

  it probably will be a great surprise to
the man who prides himself on his watch
and its accuracy to be told that no
watch clock or mechanism for the
measurement of time which has ever
been made really keeps true time

  no watch that is made be the care
taken in its manufacture ever so accu-
rate no clock no matter how construct-
ed or what elaborate precaution is taken
to prevent its fluctuating in its move-
ment will keep true time with the stars
or with the sun fictitious or real

  so the first thing to do in determining
actual time is to determine the  error
of the clock for though no clock made
will beat in absolute unison with the
earth in its accurate and never varving
speed or revolution about its axis fine
clocks and watches do keep time with
themselves to a very remarkable degree
of accuracy

  if we know the variation they make
with the earth we can easily know the
true time

  the standard clock of the united
states-as fine a clock possibly as can
be made-is in an underground vault at
the united states naval observatory at
washington district of columbia

  it is kept at a constant temperature
it is in a glass case from which the air
is exhausted below the point of least
possible atmospheric pressure so that 
changes in the barometer may affect its
running

  it is wound every thirty seconds
electrically it is run by a very small
weight because heavy weights and long
intervals between windings have been
found to cause errors in a clock s run-

ning

  this clock is the acme of simplicity in
its mechanism it was built absolutely
regardless of expense and yet - it
doesnt keep time with the earth and the

stars

  a constant comparison goes  at the
naval observatory to determine the
 rate  of the clocks  error and from
that rate to determine the true time

not easy to find exact time

  this comparison is accomplished by
continual observations of both sun and
stars through an instrument called a
meridional circle it is essentially a
telescope so mounted that its axis points
to the true east and west which can
therefore swing only in a north and
south line

  many years of observation and much
carefully gathered corrected and check-
ed tt data has enabled astronomers to
know to the fraction of a second just
when any one of certain stars termed
 fundamental stars will cross the
meridian at any given place

  if now the actual clock time at which
the certain fundamental star does cross
il time is made



that certain meridian he noted the dif-
ference between the clock time and the
previously ascertained time will be the
error of the clock

the actual determination of time is
net as simple as it sounds accurate

time is either right or it is not right
there must he no loopholes for errors

  no sick potentate receives more care
than the time-determining meridian-cir-
cle instrument which is coddled and
looked after with most tender care

it is protected from dust and jar and
heat and motion the men who use it

are never satisfied that it is correctly
mounted though it rests on huge stone
piers and its machine work is the finest
mamifactti red

its position is constantly being read
til rough no less than four microscopes

on a silver scale so finely divided that the
human eye cannot see the divisions

  every now and then the whole instru-
ment is reversed and its true north and
south positions assured by looking into
collimators which possess artificial
stars  and by looking at basins of mer-
ctirv or artificial horizons  mathe-

railroad mans magazine

matical wakes  are held over its inno-
cent corpse all the time

  the result is that all the mechanical
pressure and temperature errors are al-
lowed for the instrument is absolutely
accurate so far as human ingenuity can
make it and where it fails its failure is
known and can be eliminated in calcu-
lations

  iui still the troubles of the time de-
terminers are not over for there re-
mains the personal equation to be taken
into account - the  rate  or  error  of
the human machine

always a fraction wrong

  just as no clock can be made which
keeps perfect time with the earth so no
human being has ever been found who
could observe the transit of a star across
the cross hairs in the eve-piece of a tele-
scope and record his observation at the
same time he sees them

  he lliinks he presses the telegraph-key
at the instant the star touches the cross
hair but he doesnt lie presses the key
a fraction of a second too late more
rarely too soon

  there are several hairs in the eye-
pieces across which the  fundamental 
star is made to transit for every such
crossing the observer touches his tele-
graph-key which is connected to a
recording clock or chronograph

  while he is always a fraction of a
second wrong in his signals he usually
lias a constant  rate  or  error like
a clock if he is in the habit of touching
his telegraph-key  of a second after
the star really transits across the cross
hairs in the telescope he will usually
have the same error on all days and for
all the transits in other words for a
practised observer the personal equation
error is fairly constant

  as observations for time determina-
tion are made at washington every day
the sun shines and many observations
are made every clear night   funda-
mental star--  for the same purpose and
as many observers make these observa-
tions and the mean or average of a great
number arc constantly being used to de-
termine the error of the clock it can be
imagined that we know the actual true
time for the meridian of washington
within a verv tinv fraction of a second

  the transit instrument or meridian-
circle telescope as used at the naval ob-
servatory is thus the means of bringing
star time or true time to the earth but
it is not by any means the only instru-
ment so used

  the great equatorial instrument the
twenty-six-inch glass telescope which
made history in astronomy when the
moons of mars were discovered through
it plays an important part in securing the
data regarding  fundamental stars

  indeed all the great equatorial tele-
scopes the world over play their part in
this work-the lick the yerkes the ob-
servatory at greenwich - the tirst and
most important time meridian in the
world-and those at pulkowa and pots-
dam all are used from time to time in
measuring the angles between stars de-
termining their positions and conse-
quently their times of transit

  these huge pieces of mechanism
weighing a hundred pounds where the
transit weighs one generate internal
strains by the suspension of so heavy a
mass from a central support these
strains are entirely too great to permit
the instrument to be used for transit
work with any degree of accuracy

  but if not accurate in measuring
angles between star and earth they have
quite a remarkable and deadly accuracy
when it comes to measuring the angle
between star and star for then the strain
and stress are the same for both meas-
urements

  these huge instruments of which the
naval observatory has two - one a
twelve-inch the other the enormous
twenty-six-inch refractor play an im-
portant part in time determination al-
though a secondary one

fast as the earth turns east  their
utter exactitude depends much of the
accuracy of fundamental star determina-
tion on which in turn depends in some
measure the accuracy of the determina-
tion of the difference between twelve
oclock by the clock and twelve oclock
by the stars

one of the reasons why these instru-
how time is made



meats are so carefully made and so
elaborately fitted with an elevating floor
that moves the observer up and down so
that he may be comfortable instead of
perching on a ladder to  see  with
electric lights and electric motors to
move it and dozens of screws handles
small telescopes microscopes eye-pieces
and fast and slow motions until the
great telescope is almost as complicated
and far more exact in construction than
a locomotive-one of the reasons for all
this elaboration is this same fundamental
star determination on which depends in
no small measure the even and accurate
running of the  time of day

what happens at noon

  but to have the true time from a cal-
culation and a clock sealed up in a seldom
or never visited vault underground in
washington is one thing getting that
time to the man in the engine cab-get-
ting it to the men in all the engine cabs
all over the united states and to the
despatcher and the business men and the
city clocks and the clock in the bank and
the kitchen clock and the small boys first
watch and seeing well to it that they all
get the same time-that is a very im-
portant undertaking

  up-stairs in the time-service rooms of
the observatory are several more accu-
rately made clocks they are electrical-
ly connected with the clock in the vault
so that even if they run fast or slow the
electric current continually sets them
right with the standard clock

  two of these clocks-two so that if
one breaks down there will still be one
in service - are electrically connected
with the main wires of the western
union and postal telegraph lines

  just previous to noon eastern time
all the usual telegraph business is shunt-
ed to one side and the lines left clear for
the time signals

  at five minutes of twelve eastern
time five minutes of eleven central
time five minutes of ten mountain time
and five minutes of nine pacific time
the sounders in all these main-line tele-
graph-offices commence to beat seconds
 tick - tick - tick - tick as the two
clocks in the time-service rooms make
the connections

  at five seconds of the minute the

sounders are silent and the first  tick 
after the silence is the first second of the
new minute at ten seconds of actual
noon eastern time the sounders stop
beating and are silent for those ten
seconds then on the exact second of
noon they all chatter hard-a long roll

  noon has arrived the  mean sun 
is directly over the meridian of wash-
ington

  the clocks in all the telegraph-offices
electrically connected get their time
from these signals jewelers have clocks
electrically connected with the telegraph
companies clocks so have many hotels
so have stations and train-sheds and
despatchers offices

  the man in the cab sets his watch by
one of these clocks the man in the
street sets his watch by the jewelers
clock the tiny point of light we call a
star passing across a wire under the
eyes of a trained observer has regulated
at exactly what time the engineer of the
express will pull out

  and so when the engineer says he is
seven minutes late and has to make it
up between longport and springhaven
and his fireman bets him a cigar he is
ten seconds wrong they both look at the
first electrically connected clock to find
out whichever loses the cigar does so
with perhaps an anathema for his
watch but with perfect faith that the
 right time  is the time of the clock

the best timekeeper

  the anathema is an injustice if the
standard clock will not keep time in a
vault protected from temperature and
pressure fluctuations and without any in-
terference from jars or vibrations it is
not to be wondered at that the railroad
mans watch no matter how well made
will occasionally vary from the path of
rectitude and true star time

  the only thing which never varies
from true star time is the earth itself

  but the earth does not keep absolute
time because of a strange thing called
 procession of the equinoxes by which
our seasons are slowly slowly changing
and in the faint proper motions of the
stars there is a very slight variation be-
tween mathematical absolute time and
sidereal or star time which amounts to
one day in twenty-six thousand years

the old man of the desert

by roy otoole

               after two years at cactus siding jack
               lowden entertains a picturesque stranger

he telegraph-operator at cac-
tus siding sat in the eco-
nomical shadow cast by the
dobe shack which served as
a station and soaked up the
humid heat from the sur-
rounding sands all about him as far
as the eye could reach waving billows of
white intermingled with the occasional
green of the cactus greeted his vision
until the monotonous landscape was lost
in the misty heat waves rising from the
desert

  high up toward the cerulean blue a
vulture circled lazily but the hum of in-
sect life which rules when vegetation
adorns the wilds was absent the stern
palpable silence of the desert reigned
supreme and so it had been for days
and weeks and months

  jack lowden had been the lone in-
habitant of cactus siding for nearly two
years with the exception of a short va-
cation taken the summer previous and
the solitude of the desert had not failed
to leave its mark upon him

  train-crews stopping infrequently for
water or orders at the siding remarked
his growing indisposition to exchange
even passing pleasantries his speech
was halting and bis manner almost for-
bidding

   hes forgettin how to talk said
conductor johnson one day  hell be
gettin dotty pretty soon if he dont ask
for a change of venue they cant any
of them buck the desert very long and
get away with it

  as it happened a few days later
johnsons train was obliged to wait at
the siding for the west-bound passenger



and the conductor dropped off at the
station and greeted the operator cheer-
fully 

  hello jack he said bout time
for your summer vacation aint it 

   not this year wearily replied that
somber-looking individual  im going
to fight it out here until october then ill
have enough in the bank-roll to buy that
cottage back in ohio that ive been tell-
ing you about itll be me for gods
country and the green fields after that
 so myrtle is still waiting for you
is she jack 

   if she wasnt this hole wouldnt
hold me a minute her letters and my
dreams of that vine-covered home of the
future are all thats kept me in my right
mind out here and at that i think i feel
myself slipping sometimes

   when you begin to lose your grip on
things its time to go boy said the
conductor warningly  ive seen em stay
too long out here

   ill stick until october said jack
waving his hand listlessly as the con-
ductor climbed aboard the caboose and
signaled to proceed

  after reporting the trains jack in-
differently set about preparing a lunch
from his store of canned goods cans
were in evidence everywhere canned
corned beef canned sardines condensed
milk-everything in cans and the thou-
sands of empty cans scattered about and
partly visible in the sand of the desert
gave an illuminating idea of the per-
petual bill of fare at cactus siding

  jack lowden however in his desper-
ate loneliness had hit upon a scheme to
enliven the miserable and irregular meal-
the old man of the desert



hours and rob them to some extent of
their monotony

  chairs and tin dishes were placed on
the rickety table to accommodate two
and jack after sitting down at the
banquet board religiously served the
plate in front of the empty chair before
helping himself

   have some chicken myrtle dear
he said tenderly as he served the corned
beef  and a taste of this brook trout
as he selected a couple of fat sardines
and placed them beside the corned beef
-and so he continued throughout the
meal

  it was a harmless little deceit he was
practising on himself when he imagined
that myrtle was partaking of his un-
lovely bill of fare

   foolish he muttered  but it helps
some

  then he wrote and told her all about
her place at the table

  he received a loving tear-stained
letter in reply

   you dear lonesome boy she wrote
 my heart aches for you in that awful
place why cant you come back at once
even if we do have to wait a while longer
for our home i am so unhappy think-
ing of you out there on that miserable
desert that my heart is almost broken

  the temptation to fly from the nause-
ating monotony and discomforts of cac-
tus siding to the green fields of ohio
and the waiting arms of his boyhoods
sweetheart was strong but he shut his
teeth firmly and put the alluring desire
from his thoughts

   itd be like throwing up the sponge
before the fight was over he said  id
be a rank quitter to drop out now

  so he continued to hang on counting
the days and accumulating a bank-roll
in hopeful anticipation hearing fre-
quently and cheerfully from myrtle but
nevertheless paying unconsciously the
toll of the desert and solitude

  the despatcher at vigo was enjoying
the fragrance of an excellent havana
and gazing idly at his almost empty
train-sheet

   sure tis quiet along the pike to-
night he confided to the chief  noth-
ing on the division but a couple of drags
ill get mine pretty easy for one shift if
it never happens again

  the chief grinned amiably

   pretty soft for you fellows out here
nothing to do but smoke good cigars
and sign pay-checks lie said  hows
that fellow lowden getting along at
cactus  will he want a vacation this
summer lo go back east and see his
girl

   dont think so replied the de-
spatcher  ill ask him

  reaching to the key he languidly re-
peated the office-call for cactus a num-
ber of times but got  reply later he
tried again and was more successful

   whats the excitement down there
to-night he asked jocularly as cactus
answered  you dont seem to have
time to answer the wire must be a po-
litical meeting or circus in town 

   nothing like that replied lowden
 im entertaining a visitor

   cactus always was quite a social
center replied the despatcher who is
the distinguished party some bo who
fell off the freight  

   he hasnt presented his card yet so
i dont know he called this evening
while  was taking my constitutional i
found him sitting here in the dark when
i came back but lies not a bo hes a
prospector and has located a rich placer
diggins somewhere near here hes
camping at the spring

   spring ejaculated the despatcher
 theres  spring nearer cactus than
alkali basin and thats forty miles north
as the crow flies hes not camping
there and visiting at cactus

  the metallic sounder was silent for a
moment and then lowden replied

   he says its about three miles south
just over the big sand ridge hes go-
ing to show it to me to-morrow he
needs a partner and i think ill sign up
with him

   bully for you replied the de-
spatcher  i suppose youll go back east
to see myrtle in a special train this trip
eh  

   cant tell answered lowden
 the old man says theres oceans of free
gold out there if thats right a special
wont be any too good for me ill tell
you all about it to-morrow night

   i wish you would replied the de-
spatcher  and i f you need any more
partners in the firm let me know im
ready to quit railroading at a moments
notice


railroad mans magazine

  all right answered lowden - and
the subject was dropped for the night as
far as the wire was concerned

  as the desert is -known to contain
many rich placer deposits the news of
lowdens visitor at cactus spread rapid-
ly about vigo speculation was aroused
as to the probable area of the deposit
interest in the matter grew hourly and
early next morning lowden was eager-
ly interrogated on the wire for informa-
tion not only by the despatchers office
at vigo but by the other telegraphers
on the line his replies to all however
were extremely disappointing

    the old man pulled his freight while
i was asleep he told them  and i
havent been able to figure out which
way he went i turned the bunk-room
over to him last night and this morning
it was empty and the bunk didnt look
like anybody had slept in it i guess he
didnt turn in at all just drifted after i
went to sleep

  that evening however interest was
again awakened when lowden called the
despatcher on the wire and informed
him that his visitor of the night before
had returned

   found him here in the dark sames
i did last night said lowden but he
brought a sack of gold with him this
trip its the real yellow all right

   youre a lucky boy jack assured
the despatcher  whered he go last
night 

   back to camp i suppose i didnt
ask him hes not strong on conversa-
tion and as im only the junior partner
in the firm im not asking too many
questions he looks like hed rile easy
handle him with gloves by all
means jack advised the despatcher
 jolly him along but dont let him get
away from you again like he did last
night

   looks like he thinks im trying to
get away from him replied the op-
erator  hes sitting across the table
and hasnt said a word nor taken his
eyes off me for thirty minutes and im
beginning to get nervous hes got a
snaky pair of lamps

   dont let a little thing like that wor-
ry you said the despatcher  youre
just a trifle excited over that sack of
gold dust id feel nervous too if i
were in your shoes but it wouldnt be

about his lamps itd be from wonder-
ing how many double eagles i was go-
ing to get out of the sand

   youre right answered lowden
 i havent any kick coming because hes
sizing me up but i do wish hed look at
something else for a change he must
have my mug pretty well photographed
on his memory by this time

  the trains moving over the division de-
manded the despatchers attention at this
point and it was some hours later before
lie found time to inquire further into the
situation at cactus again he was ob-
liged to call that station some little time
before he received any response

   whatd you wake me up for  com-
plained lowden  i was pounding my
ear something scandalous

   hope your visitor is sleeping com-
fortably too said the despatcher  it
was because i was worried about him
that i called you is he camping with
you to-night

   sure replied lowden  hes in
the bunk-room thats why im sleeping
on the table

   nothing like hospitality jack sure
he aint walking in his sleep again to-
night 

   ill just look and see

   well ill be darned came over the
wire a moment later  if the old goat
hasnt flew the coop again gold dust and
all the sack was laying on the chair
when i went to sleep aint he the
limit  

  he certainly is agreed the de-
spatcher  but youre not much better
youll let that gold mine get away from
you if you dont stay awake until you
find out where it is

  if he shows up again there wont be
any more naps for me until i trail him
to the spring declared lowden  ive
written myrtle all about that gold mine
and i must find it now

  the next day conductor johnson was
obliged to make another stop at the si-
ding having heard of jacks prospector
friend through the rumors about  igo
he dropped off at the office to get some
first-hand information

  hear youre a mine-owner now
jack he began by way of introduction

  lack smiled glumly  i am and i
aint bill he said i got a kind of a
vanishing partner and its pretty hard to
the old man of the desert



tell where im at dont know whether
lies suspicious of me or what but he
dont stick around long enough for me
to get that mine located

  jack looked about uneasily as if he
expected his vanishing partner to arise
out of the sand of the desert

   ive heard a good deal about the
matter in vigo said johnson  and the
old mans story dont hold much water
with me theres no spring nearer here
than alkali basin unless its broke loose
in the last couple of years its my own
private opinion that the old man is ex-
pecting to get his free gold off no 
to-night theres a rumor on the pike
that shell carry a whole car-load of it
from the frisco mint i got your friend
sized for a hold-up man

  by thunder you may be right
johnson exclaimed the operator
 thatd explain his mysterious actions
though i dont see how hed get away
with it its sixty miles to the moun-
tains and thats some walk  the
desert

   you dont know what lies got be-
hind the sand ridge there may be half
a dozen of em over there with horses
guns and all the rest of it if he shows
up to-night give him the glad hand but
tell the despatcher to have  prepared
for a hold-up at cactus

   sure ill do that replied the op-
erator  it wont do any harm though
i hope it dont turn out that way id
hate to give up my dreams of that gold-
mine

   it dont look reasonable to me said
johnson  that if he did have a rich
prospect out there hed be in much of a
hurry to call in a partner and give him
half sounds pretty fishy

   guess youre right about that
agreed the operator  hes either nutty
or else that free-gold story is a stall
ill watch him pretty close if he shows
up to-night

  having implanted the hold-up idea
firmly in lowdens mind johnson
climbed aboard the caboose and the long
string of alkali-covered box cars re-
sumed their dusty journey

  that evening the despatcher at vigo
busily engaged in putting out train-or-
ders disentangling complications arising
from hot-boxes and other unexpected
delays to nearly every train on the divi-

sion snorted profanely when cactus
broke in on the wire and feverishly took
the circuit

  whats broke loose down there
he asked angrily  cant you let me get
the - red ball  out of the hole before you
chip in  

   stop  at rawley continued the
metallic voice from cactus in the same
feverish manner  theres a hold-up
man here he made me set the signal
red and then chased me into the bunk-
room he didnt know i had an instru-
ment in here

   how many of them are there  
asked the despatcher

   one is all ive seen so far but hes
got guns enough to do the job all by him-
self hes a regular walking arsenal
there may be others outside

   its too late to stop  at rawley
they left there ten minutes ago is there
any obstruction on the track  

   dont know say continued low-
den  hes listening right at the door
think lies heard me pounding this key
hes opening the door and coming in-
the wire remained open a few sec-
onds then came a string of unintelli-
gible dots-then silence

   looks like lies done for lowden
said the chief who had been standing by
 order out a special and give them right
over  to tinhorn well load it up
with rangers if lowdens been mur-
dered well make it hot for whoever did
the job

  the call-boy was hurried out to find a
crew for the special while the round-
house was ordered to have an engine on
the main line inside of thirty minutes

  two coaches were switched to the
depot platform and as the rumor of the
hold-up circulated about town the grim
stern-faced armed rangers of the desert
brigade made their appearance and took
their places inside the waiting coaches

  o the siding below the depot a box
car stood at the stock pen saddled
horses were loaded rapidly into it with
such supplies as were needed for a desert
campaign

  in a remarkably short space of time
the special hurried out into the dreary
waste on its mission of vengeance

  in the mean time no  approached
cactus the engineer seeing the red
signal out grunted dismally


railroad mans magazine

   too bad lie couldnt put his orders
out at a regular stop instead of holding
us up at the jumping-off place of the
whole system

  the conductor hurried to the tele-
graph-office to learn the cause of the un-
expected delay to his train as he en-
tered a curious spectacle confronted
him jack lowden stood in the doorway
of the bunk-room his hands high above
his head and his gaze riveted intently on
the empty chair at the telegraph-table

   look out  he screamed as the con-
ductor entered  look out dont you
see lies going to shoot 

  slowly his upraised hands clasped his
temple and he dropped in a senseless
heap

  the conductor thoroughly alarmed
despatched the brakeman through the
coaches in search of medical assistance
when the shack returned a few moments
later fortunately with one of the com-
panys physicians lowden sat propped
against the wall talking wildly of hold-
ups free gold and myrtle

  how longs lie been out here
asked the physician

   couple of years that i know of
replied the conductor explaining the
tableau he saw when he came into the
office

   humph no wonder lies been seeing
things if lies been here that long carry
him into the pullman tersely ordered
the physician  ill get his transporta-
tion to el paso from tinhorn

  a partly written letter to myrtle which
lay  the telegraph-table furnished the
physical with all the confirmation lie
needed for his statement that lowden
had been seeing things it read

  my recent acquaintance who lias been
  coming and going so mysteriously the last

  couple of evenings is i fear not a pros-
  pector at all hut will more likely prove
  to lie a hold-up man with designs upon
   to-night

    see said the physician turning to
the conductor  lies been having an
imaginary visitor out here  the old
man of the desert  they usually call him
simply a hallucination produced by the
desire for human companionship

  some weary months later jack became
convalescent lounging upon the veran-
da of the el paso hospital was now his
daily pastime reside him usually sat a
sweet-faced old lady-his mother-and a
blooming girl of nineteen

  jack dear the girl said when i
read that rambling letter from you tell-
ing about the old man comingto visit
you i knew that something was wrong
for even away back in ohio we have
heard of the  old man of the desert and
your mother and i were almost on the
point of coming out here when she re-
ceived the message that you were danger-
ously ill oh jack suppose you had
followed him out on the desert to search
for gold 

  she shuddered at the awful possibility
if what they say is true replied
jack  thats where he generally leads
his victims-somewhere out in the sands
to die of heat and thirst but that hold-
up idea of johnsons kept me on the job
and no doubt saved my life id heard
lots of tales about the old fellow before
he came to see me but never suspected
his identity

  i remember everything distinctly
his general appearance weapons and all
up to the time i called the despatcher
and told him of the hold-up i thought
was coming off strange what realistic
hallucinations one gets on the desert

long journeys made by plovers

bird migration lias always been and is
yet a thing of much mystery let the
man who has never felt the thrill of
this mystery take his atlas and turn to a map
of the western hemisphere let him locate
the arctic islands north of north america
say seventy-five degrees n l and with his
pencil draw from there a line down along
the coast of labrador across to newfound-
land and down to nova scotia then across
the atlantic to the lesser antilles in the
west indies from there to brazil and across

to argentina and finally halt his pencil in
patagonia he will have traced then what
is said to be the southward migration of the
american plover but let him continue the
course across to the pacific northward up
the coast then across central america and
up the mississippi valley through central
canada and back to the northern islands
he will then have mapped what naturalists
have given as the yearly itinerary of some
of these wonderful birds-a journey of some
fifteen thousand miles-outing
the tropic boomer

      though attractive at long range the facts gathered
      by one who has been there prove that railroad-
      ing in latin countries had better be let alone

by n j paterson

-ailroad men particularly
dfmjf engineers and machinists
ejmi at some time in their
careers become a prey to
s i wanderlust those of the
clan who may read this will
appreciate this truth with the majority
it arises through the spirit of romance
with others the impulse is mercenary no
consideration being given to what is
ahead but with all none can dispute that
the desire is dominant to follow their
respective callings in some land other
than their own

  some years ago it was general to-
day it is a daily remark to overhear in
any railroad terminal provided local
affairs fail to suit  oh ill jack the job
up and go to mexico

  many did go too and not a few much
further

travelers hide the truth

  not only mexico but cuba south
america and even china and japan has
each a full quota of disgruntled railroad
employees from the united states nine
of every ten would part witli five years
of their lives to be home again after
only five months service in the promised
land

  now that the world has grown smaller
it is certainly astonishing that such ig-
norance should prevail in regard to ex-
isting conditions in railroad work as is
found in those countries it is all the
more remarkable that the pilgrim does
not seek more definite information be-
fore  going out it is a comparatively

easy job to get out but a mighty hard
one to get back-as many of the tropical
boomers will sorrowfully attest

  a possible explanation lies in the fact
that very little that is practical has been
written along these interesting lines and
because those who have gained practical
experience through adventure are averse
to telling the truth on their inevitable
return

  they dont care to advertise how badly
they were fooled

  for instance in the spring of  the
railroads of mexico were paying five and
six dollars a day for roundhouse ma-
chinists

  those who took the journey unless
well-informed  the currency of mexi-
co were not aware of the fact that those
dollars meant mexican  dobies when
they reached silao on the central or
some other point they received five dol-
lars as promised but at the rate of ex-
change then prevailing this sum amount-
ed to about  gold

 as none of the men probably had been
getting less than three dollars a day in
this country it did not take them long to
realize that the change was not a finan-
cial benefit

roam for experience

  there was no difference in the work
either and there is none to-day a loco-
motive engine calls for the same daily
attention whether running on the penn-
sylvania the transsiberian or on the
united railways of the argentine re-

public and this feature is even more
conspicuous in mexico on account of the
exceedingly long divisions

  a majority of the boomer machinists
in mexico entertain the hope that they
will some time get back to their own
country with this vision in view they
try to save a little money but there is
not much incentive toward this laudable
effort in view of the omnipresent fact
that two dollars of mexican savings
must be surrendered at the frontier for
one dollar american

  nevertheless the  land of nianana
has been and probably will remain as the
mecca for the boomer machinist this
may remain as a relic of the so-called
good old days say twenty years ago
when it was customary for the newly
graduated apprentice to roam for  ex-
perience

  of course he could have acquired
valuable experience much nearer home
but he wouldnt be thought much of on
his return unless he brought documents
to prove that he had been employed by
the national the international or the
central-preferably on all three

romance that quickly pales

  it is furthermost from my purpose to
 knock  or say anything derogatory
about the railroads of the tropics they
are well-equipped and operate under
conditions peculiar to themselves these
conditions are very peculiar however
and why american railroad men want to
mix up with them furnished the inspira-
tion of this article

  frequently the question is asked
around shops and railroad terminals by
machinists and engineers out of work
 would it be safe to go lo mexico on
the chance of getting a job 

  the proper answer is  yes unless
the applicant has been guilty beyond for-
giveness of some offense against dis-
cipline

  practical and competent men are in
demand at all times this applies in
mexico as well as here so there is little
doubt about getting a job it has been
my personal experience that if either an
engineer or a machinist would present
himself to the proper employing official
and talk intelligently along those re-
spective lines for about ten minutes he

would be taken on without further cre-
dentials

  eliminating the charm of adventure
however which quickly pales when you
have no companion to share it with you
there is little inducement to go to the
tropics  bile not considering railroad
officials there is little doubt that quite a
few of the rank and lile have sought
foreign service owing to grievous trouble
at home

  they work abroad because they are
obliged to earn their own living

  one of the most discouraging remarks
i ever heard was made in my presence
by james e gordon a director of the
american society in mexico

   it only exists he said  to help you
fellows get home and to give you hos-
pital attention when down with the
fever

lose time through festivals

  while the pay is adequate to support
a man in comfort provided he works
steadily and in time to even provide
a competence should he decide to remain
in mexico indefinitely there is still as
in the case of a machinist much to
operate against drawing a  full month

  a potent factor is the pretext seized
upon at any time by the native help
about the shops to take a day off op-
portunity often presents itself because
there are nearly one hundred religious
festivals in a year

  the observance of many of these is
so general that the shops are practically
tied up and as little would be gained
through retaining the comparatively few
american machinists they are obliged to
lose their time until the natives see fit
to return

  on the contrary living expenses are
reasonable a man can live comforta-
bly in mexico city for  per month
silver and as low as  in the country
but the prices charged for clothing
especially shoes and overalls are ruin-
ous five dollars is the lowest for a suit
of overalls

  at the outlying points where the va-
rious railroads maintain restaurants for
the accommodation of the traveling pub-
lic employees are allowed to eat three
standard meals for one mexican dollar
a day approximately fifty cents in
the tropic boomer



united states money the food is boun-
tifully supplied

  in the large cities a man must hustle
for a restaurant within his means or
make some arrangement with a private
family to secure board with meals

tools very costly

  another item of expense in all tropical
countries is the high cost of machinists
tools although the only tools one can
purchase are those manufactured in the
united states

  the old saying  a good mechanic
can work without tools cannot be lit-
erally accepted because many opera-
tions to-day especially machine-shop
work are much more complicated than
in former years and special tools are
absolutely necessary to speedily and
properly perform certain work

  we all remember that the kit of the
old time boomer-if he had a kit-con-
sisted of a two-foot rule a pair of inside
and outside calipers a hook scriber and
a center punch these invaluable im-
plements of the trade will not suffice to-
day when one is traveling in foreign
countries

  mexican helpers are generally unprin-
cipled it is not uncommon when a ma-
chinist leaves his hammer on the floor
while he walks around to the other side
of the engine  which he is working to
find it missing on his return

few natives are mechanics

  native help does not receive excep-
tionally high pay some of the most
capable get no more than  a day
so they probably feel that they must sup-
plement their wages in some way if
the rightful owner ever recovers his
property it will be found in a pawn-shop

  a visit to one of the pawn-shops with
which the tropical cities abound will dis-
close invariably a weird assortment of
hammers wrenches calipers try
squares straight edges and many of the
higher-priced tools such as combination
squares -erniers surface and depth
gages etc the original owners of which
foolishly imagined that they would be
able to take into the tropics and bring
them out again if they were obliged
to replace any of these in order to do

their work just about three times as
much had to be paid for them in the
tropics as in the united states and
canada

  both the mexican central and the
national for a long time have been ex-
perimenting with native labor although
it is a notorious fact that the average
native simply detests a skilled trade
there is scarcely one in a thousand with
an aptitude for mechanics

  this move on the part of the railroads
arose from a realization of the fact that
because of similar conditions they could
not depend on american help staying
with them after a sufficient  stake  had
been accumulated and that the only
salvation in securing a permanent force
was to begin the gradual education of
the mexican

small chance to climb

  accordingly they start a boy on a
lathe planer or shaper and there he
stays all his life not designated as a
machinist but simply as a  lathe hand
 planer hand or whatever it may be

  they do not possess the versatility to
become  all-round hands although in
time many learn how to work acceptably
as drill pressmen grinders and bolt-
cutters

  no american machinists are ever em-
ployed on such work they are needed
for the finer details in the erecting gang
the roundhouse setting valves hanging
guides and laying out work the reason
that it would be safe to go to mexico
expecting to find a vacancy among these
men is because practically all of them
want to leave at the first opportunity i
fully believe that within a few years all
work in mexican railroad shops except-
ing the supervision will be handled by
natives

  it is well to state these facts plainly
as they are based on personal observa-
tion while working in various capacities
in that country my only purpose is to
correct the erroneous impression among
the railroad men of this country who
have not been employed as yet off their
own road

  there are instances on record where
american machinists have secured regu-
lar work in the tropics married and
settled down to stay but they are very

rare when the long rainy season comes
bringing into full prominence the damp-
ness and the unsanitary condition of the
dwelling-houses the stoutest heart will
sigh for the comforts which can only be
found further north

  rheumatism fever and the plague of
various insects all add their quota in in-
tensifying the discomfort of the situa-
tion and the desire to make a  getaway

long runs for men

  on the road of course it is different
because the most apt native on earth
could scarcely ever learn to run an
engine and keep out of trouble there
are instances where the dubious experi-
ment of setting them up as switch-en-
gineers has been tried this has worked
after a fashion but popular feeling is
against it

  practically all of the engineers and
conductors are americans while the ma-
jority of the firemen and brakemen are
natives

  the engineers get their positions by
applying to the master mechanic of the
division on which they desire work if
found acceptable they are placed on the
extra board to await their turn for a reg-
ular train naturally the passenger runs
are very few and being held by the
veterans in the service it would be a
long time before a new man could get
such a run a fair living however may
be made in the freight end while on the
extra list

  the runs are so very long that not
many trips are necessary in a month to
keep a man going for instance on the
central of mexico some years ago the
division for freight as well as passenger
was from silao to mexico city going
south  miles and return to silao a
total of  miles

  as one way over the division now re-
quires  hours and  minutes for a pas-
senger train it can be imagined readily
how many more hours would be put in
on a freight

  going north the division extended
from silao to calera  miles and re-
turn and it was required that an engi-
neer should be competent to run over
each division as might be necessary

  the unique condition thus developed
that a man must learn over five hundred

miles of main line there is no parallel
in this country and probably not in the
world for such a stretch of territory in
one mans head this is somewhat com-
pensated for however because much of
it is straight away and plain sailing and
the time not particularly fast

  one point should be made prominent
in connection with all tropical railroad-
ing an engineer should never accept a
position without first writing to the
master mechanic in order to learn the
opportunities that exist and to secure all
possible information on the conditions
governing the work

  after the deal is closed he should
make a brief study of the legal aspect of
his calling so far as it relates to placing
responsibility for wrecks and for in-
juries to fellow employees

  some of these laws are rather pe-
culiar especially in mexico and often
result in an extremely embarrassing
predicament for the unfortunate who
transgresses them

  the mexican legislators have never
accepted the fact that an engine while
running is not always able to stop  a
three-cent piece at an instants notice
they believe that there is  excuse for
even excusable accidents

  a story is told of one road which
boasted that  one in its employ was
ever arrested or imprisoned as those who
might be charged with the accident
promptly disposed of the corpse the
usual procedure was to cremate the
body exceptional opportunity being
presented by the fire-box

   although the exaggerated yarns freely
circulated in this country that the mexi-
can authorities demand the life of an
engineer who runs over a native are only
travelers tales the fact remains that the
consequences are very unpleasant

long imprisonment for accident

  they have for an inevitable sequel a
long term of imprisonment before the
case is called to trial mexican justice
moves slowly and mexican jails are
neither cleanly nor desirable places in
which to reside indefinitely

   to illustrate how easy it is to get in
trouble with the law the following in-
cident might be cited

  the wreck train was called out about
the tropic boomer



seven oclock one night to go from silao
to guaje about forty miles to replace a
string of cars which were off the iron

  the train crew and the mexican fire-
man were provided forthwith and the
caller was despatched for engineer rior-
dan who happened to be  first out  on
the extra board riordan was the only
available man in town

   when the caller returned to the round-
house he bore the  o k of the engi-
neer  his book but it soon became
noticed that the engineer was a surpri-
singly long time showing up in view of
the importance of the call finally
toward eight oclock the despatcher be-
gan burning up the wires with forceful
inquiries as to why the wrecker hadnt
started

  as there was no one qualified to take
the train the only logical procedure was
to send a search-party after the tardy
one but he wasnt at home or in any of
his haunts after a prolonged inquiry
he was located in the lock-up it be-
came necessary to awaken the mayor
who had retired early that evening and
some say to cross his palm in order to
secure the order for the engineers re-
lease

  riordan had left his boardtng-place
promptly after signing the call-book but
in hurrying across the plaza toward the
roundhouse he raised a policemans lan-
tern which was resting in the center of
the square the better to observe his
watch

   to touch this sacred lantern is equiva-
lent in the eyes of the law to an assault
on the officer himself the officer
usually reposes on a bench some little
distance from his light which is left in
a prominent place to indicate that lie is
in the vicinity if wanted riordan was
green however and the wreck train left
some two hours late

jailed for passing a shrine

  another curious illustration of the
working of the law occurred some years
ago on the mexican or  queens own
railway which was first to connect the
capital with the eastern seaport of vera
cruz

   when this road was laid out the senti-
ment against railroads was quite strong
because of the danger supposed to be

associated with them even the more
intelligent mexicans could not be in-
duced to abandon the idea that boarding
a train as a passenger invited death
there was a local life-insurance concern
in puebla which stipulated the forfeiture
of a policy if the holder rode not only
on the mexican but on any other rail-
way

  a few wrecks complicated the situ-
ation and therefore those natives com-
pelled to become passengers through
unavoidable circumstances resolved to
travel through the instrumentality of di-
vine grace they erected along the line
every two miles a stone shrine it was
agreed by the railroad company that the
train should stop at any one of these
shrines designated to the conductor in
order that the passengers might alight
and offer up prayers allowing them to
reach the next shrine alive

  engineer mcelroy who is now em-
ployed somewhere in the pittsburgh dis-
trict was unaware of any such regula-
tions one morning he passed the sacred
monolith at schedule speed he spent
many months in jail in consequence be-
fore the authorities became convinced
that no sacrilege was intended

pay suspended during sickness

  all modern appliances for-safeguard-
ing trains are in evidence but there are
some tortuous divisions to run over
that portion of the mexican railway
known as the  mountain division be-
tween orizaba and esperanza has prob-
ably no parallel on earth for physical
obstacles overcome by a broad-gage line

  on this stretch of forty miles may be
encountered grades of four per cent and
curves of less than  feet radius in
the vicinity of malt rata it is possible to
view the line of road  seven different
terraces and the same natives who sell
the passengers their wares  the top of
the mountain will meet the train five or
six times more by scrambling down the
slopes while it is making a long detour

  phis road was built by english capital
english methods prevail to a large ex-
tent and the wages paid to both shop-
men and engineers are correspondingly
lower than those of the other mexican
lines it is the most difficult road in
that country for the american boomer

  although mexico is the principal field
for railroad men seeking employment in
strange lands many of the south amer-
ican roads have received their share 
attention one of these in particular is
the guayquil and quito of ecuador
not very long ago it advertised for en-
gineers offering  sucres about 
per month in gold with transportation
out and after one years service free re-
turn transportation home

  my personal observation leads me to
offer this advice regarding the g  q
in two words  stay home

  while it is possible to make the prom-
ised  there is a reverse to the shield
that is the way the money goes meals
are  to  per month a room at the
home terminal  to  per month a
room at the other end  per night
hospital service when sick or injured 
a day during which period pay is sus-
pended

   also noticed that the railroad men
recruited in the united states received
their passage to guayquil but in nearly
every instance the  return free fare 
was evaded and it cost the luckless pil-
grim  gold to again see his home

  on the mountain division of this rail-
road the grade is so stiff that  feet
elevation is gained in  miles over
curves as high as  degrees the limit
of train far a -ton engine with  x
 inch cylinders is only four -

capacity cars the road finally attains
the modest elevation of  feet
above sea-level

  the railways of cuba which once
numbered in their ranks seventy per cent
american engineers have now scarcely
ten per cent it has been found that the
british engineers are much better stay-
ers and the work is naturally falling to
them whenever outside help becomes
necessary furthermore their employ-
ment is gradually establishing a scale of
pay based  that of the roads of great
britain

  all things considered cuba is the
least desirable place for a man seeking
foreign railroad employment

  not only my own experience but that
of many others will substantiate the fact
that there is nothing to be gained and
everything to be lost by a railroad man
leaving this country any idea that
your financial condition will be bettered
is absolutely an error any expectation
of possible promotion may as well be
abandoned before starting

  a moments reflection should convince
any one that the most essential qualifi-
cation toward this end would be a
mastery of the spanish language the
preponderance of native labor employed
dictates that it shall be the tongue of the
road without it with the possible ex-
ception of the engineer all foreigners
are badly handicapped

james watt the celebrated improver
of the steam engine entertained a very
low opinion of the mechanical ability
of scotsmen but be was prejudiced with-
out just cause the impression was spread
that highlanders had  skill as artisans
although in truth their smiths were the
best sword makers in the british isles

mitted a crime that caused the sheriff of
invernesshire to cause his arrest and in-
tended hanging the sword maker when
cluny mcphcrson heard of the outrage he
went to the sheriff and offered to let him
hang two weavers in place of the one smith

by

moore

 jy unk   ex-
  claimed pete

         he propped
his feet on top of a
crate of chickens tilted his chair back
and blew a cloud of smoke at the roof

  flapdoodle - and i can prove it
spose you was walkin along through
the woods never thinkin there was any-
thing more dangerous around than a
squirrel or rabbit and a mountain lion
dropped out of a tree do you guess he
wouldt hurt you just because you
wasnt feelin afraid

   that aint the point argued the
baggageman leaning forward and re-
moving his pipe from his lips  a fel-
ler would be afraid by the time the lion
got onto him

   you see if he didnt know the beast
was there he couldnt tell whether he
was going to be afraid or not but -
with much emphasis and sufficient pause
to lend weight to the conjunction- if
he knew the lion was in the tree and then
wasnt afraid why he could walk right
along about his own business and-

   and the lion would land on him just
the same interrupted pete

   it would not i say-

   and i say it would unless the feller

looked it squarely in the eye of
course then he wouldnt be bothered
nobody neednt worry about bein hurt
in that case toby the hypnotic power
of the human eye will quell any wild
beast and make it cat out of your
hand but its all rot to say a moun-
tain lion wouldnt maul a man up if he
got a chance whether the man was
afraid of him or not how d the lion
know spose hed stop to ask ques-
tions eh  

  toby snorted

   you make me tired the lions in-
stinct would tell him of course and he
wouldnt touch the feller-wouldnt pay
no attention to him at all

  you got that about the hypnotic
power of the human eye  out of a book
you never had brains enough to think
it up by yourself i know what im
talkin about  do

   good thing you do its a cinch no
one else would observed pete with gen-
tle irony  now look here toby it
stands to reason youre wrong dont
you know an animal-trainer doesnt dare
turn his back while lies in a cage he
has to keep his eyes on the beasts all the
time-has to cow them just by the power
of his gaze




railroad mans magazine

  dont that show im right cried
toby triumphantly  he dassent turn
his back because hes afraid if he
wasnt he could do anything he liked
but just because hes scared theyll jump
him if he aint watchin em every min-
ute he keeps lookin at em

   i guess ive proved my case pete

   proved nothin contradicted pete
snapping his fingers  it just shows
how much you know about it why do
you think-but no you dont or you
wouldnt talk like a fool id just like
to see what youd do if you was turned
loose with that beast over there ill bet
a hat you wouldnt turn your back you
jackass

  he pointed in the direction of the
heavily slatted crate within which
crouched a long tawny shape with half-
closed eyes and restless uneasy move-
ments

  the crate and its contents had come
all the way from chicago under con-
signment to the bronx zoo on the last
hundred or so miles of the long journey
pete and toby respectively messenger
and baggageman  the combination
baggage-and-express car had fallen into
a dispute over the big cat-a dispute
which waxed more and more acrimoni-
ous as each man stubbornly expounded
and defended his own theory refusing
to admit that the others contention con-
tained a single particle of reason

  toby was almost speechless with rage
he found enough breath to air a few of
his own opinions and in conclusion
delicately hinted that animals with long
fur-bearing ears were his particular
specialty he even repeated his con-
viction that in a personal encounter with
one he would be victorious with one
hand tied behind him

  having discarded his coat he faced
the messenger who lost no time in
taking up an appropriate attitude in
another instant the car would have been
the scene of a lively mix-up but just
then the train came to a halt at a wav-
station and the voice of the conductor
was heard outside shouting lustily for
toby and pete

  darting malignant glances at each
other they went through to the rear to
obey the summons for the next few
minutes they were obliged to forget their
differences or at least postpone them

while they attended to their several du-
ties

  then the station-agent engaged both
in conversation it was not until the
train was gathering speed beyond the
station that they returned to the car
toby laboring under the weight of a
large suit-case which pete had refused
to touch as it was checked through on a
ticket and not consigned to the tender
mercies of the express company

  toby carried his burden well forward
and slammed it down with a resounding
thud before turning about

   now then he said belligerently
 im walkin through the pasture where
the jackass is 

  the other needed no second chal-
lenge with a whoop of anger he sprang
forward his fists clenched his eyes bla-
zing toby squared off and waited for
him circling slowly and warily around
in the confined space

   ill fix you for that  pete promised
wrathfully  before im through with
you ill push your misfit mug through
the back of your neck call me a jack-
ass will you  you- holy moses
look at that

  not ten feet away between the two
men and the door crouched the moun-
tain lion its long tail waving snakily
its yellow eyes glittering blood was
dripping from its jaws to the sides of
which adhered a few feathers-one of
the chickens had been overtaken by pre-
mature fate

  with a yell toby abandoned his con-
templated chastisement of pete and
leaped for the top of the now empty
crate he landed with a crash and hasti-
ly drew up his feet pete sprang nim-
bly in the air clutched one of the iron
bars which were fitted horizontally from
wall to wall of the car close to the roof
and bracing his feet against another bar
hung on for dear life

  the lion looked from one to the other
with an expression of grieved surprise
took a few steps forward and stopped
hesitatingly evidently uncertain which
was the more deserving of its immediate
attention

  apparently deciding in favor of the
tall express-messenger the beast padded
silently along with uplifted nose sniffing
the air inquiringly pete performed an
agile gymnastic feat scrambling awk-
whos afraid	

wardly along the bars something like a
man trying to climb up a ladder on the
wrong side the lion followed under-
neath

 take him away toby take him
away  pete yelled twisting his head
frantically from side to side in an effort
to see what the lion was doing

  look him in the eye suggested
toby maliciously he felt that he could
afford to be facetious as he was in a safe
place  the hypnotic power of the hu-
man eye will quell any wild beast look
him straight in the eye 

 how in blazes can i demanded
pete fiercely  i aint got eyes in the
back of my head where is he any-
way  i cant see him at all  

 help hes after me shrieked
toby loudly

  attracted by the sound of another
voice the lion turned and was sniffing
the edges of the crate on which the
trembling baggageman had taken refuge

  well you aint afraid of him get
down and throw him out the window
counseled pete  why dont you do
something besides jump up and down
and yell the brute wont hurt you if
you aint afraid of him get down and
grab him while you got a good chance 
 look him in the eye look him in
the eye vociferated toby help
help hes coinin up here after me
oh look him in the eye 

  from his aerial perch pete could see
the agitated figure shrinking against the
wall as the lion its inspection of the
lower slats finished slowly reared on its
hind legs and thrust a blood-stained muz-
zle over the top of the crate

   murder get a gun and shoot him
yelled toby making a vain attempt to
climb up the side of the car  why
dont you shoot him

   wheres the gun   demanded pete
 i cant shoot him without something
to shoot with can i what did you do
with the gun 

   its over on top of the safe oh
oh   the lion had slipped back on all
fours again and was poised for a spring
its hungry eyes gazing at the plump mor-
sel on the crate just out of reach

  pete began a hazardous journey along
the bars in the direction of the safe but
at his first movement the lion suddenly
turned bounded half the length of the

 i aint got eyes in the back of mv head  

car and with a loud snarl stood directly
under the gymnast who paralyzed with
fright hung suspended by hands and
feet craning his neck to observe the
menacing beast beneath

   why dont you get down off that
monkey perch and look him in the eye 
toby had somewhat recovered his com-
posure now that the lions embarrassing
attention was directed elsewhere  the
power of the human eye-

  hang the human eye catch him
you said you wasnt afraid grab his
tail before lie jumps hes got me 
but he hadnt once more he had
padded swiftly back to the crate pete
heartened by the respite made desperate
efforts to hurry along the roof toward
the revolver which lay at the forward
end of the car on top of the express
companys safe


railroad mans magazine

 his anguished cries temporarily
hushed toby squeezed into as small and
inconspicuous a compass as possible and
watched his companion with bated
breath

  reaching a vantage-point directly over
the safe pete cautiously reached down
and secured possession of the revolver
then traveling backward hand over
hand he braced his feet firmly between
the bars took a tight grip with his left
hand and twisting his body half around
pointed his weapon at the yellow peril
which sat on its haunches in the middle
of the car

  there was a flash a puff of white
smoke a deafening report and a roar of
pain from the top of the crate two
more reports sounded in quick succes-
sion when the smoke cleared away the
enemy was observed still sitting calmly
on the floor while toby his eyes pop-
ping from his head was hopping up and
down on one foot and holding the other
with both hands

   dont you shoot that gun again  he
bawled as pete prepared for further

target practise  what do you think
youre aimin at eh  i aint the lion  
 did you get hurt  inquired pete
anxiously  i dont see how the bullet
come to go so high   aimed low

    aw you couldnt hit a barn unless
you went inside and shut the doors 
snapped toby bitterly

   he put his other foot down and gin-
gerly rested his weight upon his toes
which still stung where one of the bul-
lets had carried away a ortion of the
sole of his shoe

   gimme the gun you aint to be
trusted with firearms-not when im
around i got a wife and three chil-
dren to support and i aint takin no
chances

   i done the best i could apolo-
gized pete  it aint the easiest thing
in the world to shoot straight when
youre bangin from the ceiling upside
down like a fly ill just try again
 not much you wont throw
that gun over here the brutes quiet
now and i can hit him easy

  the revolver hurtled through the
air and landed on top of the crate
rising the lion capered blithely over
toward its late prison toby in a
panic seized the weapon almost before
it had touched the boards at his feet and
blazed away at the approaching yellow
eyes

    hit him easy can you  jeered pete
 point the cud of the gun at him-not
the butt 

   bang bang  the car was filled
with smoke

   ouch  screeched pete clutching
frantically at his trousers im shot
im shot

  his feet slipped from between the
bars and he swung to a vertical position
with a jerk that nearly wrenched his arm
free from its socket he made a wild but
ineffectual effort to regain his position
but the lion rushed forward and his
arms seemed to partake of the paralysis
of his mind

  the next instant he was lying on his
back on the floor bawling lustily for
assistance

   good-by pete good-by  toby
dropped the now empty revolver and
leaned mournfully forward to sec the
last of the victim the crate over-
balanced trembled swayed and plunged

   help 

   murder 

    gr-r-r-r-r-r 

  pandemonium broke loose in the car
around the floor rolled a rapidly rota-
ting mass of yelling men and snarling
mountain lion now and then an arm or
leg emerged for an instant only to be
immediately drawn back again into the
chaotic maelstrom the crate of chick-
ens was smashed to fragments and the
disnlal squawking of the terrified fowls
added to the hideous din

  in the midst of the hubbub the side
door was slid back and the astonished
face of a station-agent peered in at the
combat raging  the car floor

  the newcomer gave but one look
then a large white hen noting the open
doorway and seeing a way of escape
launched herself with outspread wings
and deadly accuracy full in his face the
feathered catapult was followed by an-
other and another the horrified agent
leaping from the top of the raised bag-
gage platform upon which he had been
standing tore down the track

  from every car window a head
emerged only to be hastily withdrawn
as word was passed along inside the
coaches that in the baggage-car a tight to
the death was being carried on between
a man-eating lion which had broken out
of the iron cage designed to hold him
during his transportation to the menage-
rie at bronx park and started to make
a meal of the express-messenger

  another story had it that the ferocious
and bloodthirsty animal had sprung out
of a tree in the woods climbed through
the window of the locomotive and fallen
tooth and claw upon the engineer whom
the fireman had tried to defend with
the shovel

  armed with a highly gilded ax se-
lected from the accident equipment and
followed by several brakemen similarly
protected the conductor hurried to the
scene of the fray inside the car the
spinning whirl of man and beast had
abated no whit while the noise had if
possible increased

   kill him somebody  came tobys
now feeble voice from the center of
activity kill him

  the rescuing party hesitated - not
      rr

from lack of valor or a desire to grant
the request but because an attempt to
cut short the career of that writhing
yellow body was reasonably certain to re-
sult in the performance of a similar office
for one of the human arms or legs
thrashing about in the air

  a crowd of awestricken passengers
had gathered-at a safe distance-offer-
ing advice and suggestions innumerable
but the battle waged on with no hope
that it would come to an end until the
fierce beast of the jungle either tired
out his victims and despatched them or
stayed in one position long enough to
enable some one to hit him

  suddenly a piercing scream rose high
above the clamor a girl rushed through
the crowd scrambled upon the baggage
platform and sprang into the car

 oh baby baby she wailed
wringing her hands  what are they
doing to you  

  from the swirling twisting cyclone on
the floor at her feet a tawny head
reared itself then appeared a neck fol-
lowed by a long slim body and a waving
tail as the lion with a mighty heave
shook itself free and sprang toward the
girl

  a gasp of horror went up from the
onlookers the conductor raised his ax

on her knees wreathing her arms about
the neck of the ferocious brute she put
her face close to the gaping jaws and-
kissed the black nose

  oh baby dear she cried with a

they do to you did the nasty men try
to hurt my little pet the hateful

dejected mien now and then lifting a
pair of pathetic eyes to the solicitous
face bent above him

   its a shame so it is poor dear
little baby the girl cuddled poor
dear little babys massive head under her
arm and turned indignantly to face the
stupefied conductor

  what does this mean she cried
 i demand an explanation who are
these men -pointing an accusing fore-
finger at toby and pete- and by what
right do they maltreat my pet

  thats a fine tidy pet beggin your
pardon miss he broke open his cage
and made a dead set at pete and me i
just got my foot out of the way before
lie grabbed it but he tore off part of
the sole with his teeth and pete-
why i thought he was a goner sure
the beast chased him all around the
car and he got him down and i tried to
save him and he-

   you are not telling the truth 
broke in the girl  baby wouldnt hurt
a fly you must have been teasing her
or she thought you wanted to play w hy
shes been a pet ever since she was a
week old even if she wanted to hurt
you she couldnt shes so old all her
teeth are gone but one or two perhaps
she was hungry and got out of the cage
to get something to eat  dont suppose
you were decent enough to feed her -
with contemptuous scorn  and then
you fired that thing at her and struck
her-and i think you both ought to he
ashamed of yourselves im going to
make a complaint against both of you
the idea-to hurt a poor helpless
animal 

    please miss-we didnt know she
was tame began pete

   you surely didnt think she was dan-
gerous asked the girl

   h no miss toby hastened to as-
sure her  but we thought he - er - she
might be a valuable animal you see and

when she got out we thought we ought
to try to put him back and she wouldnt
go-and thats how it was

   beg pardon miss suggested the
conductor respectfully  but well have
to be moving on were late now ill
see that the animal is taken care of all
right

   i will not leave her declared the
girl firmly  i shall stay right here with
her and see that no one abuses her any
more

  the incensed young woman was fin-
ally prevailed on to return to her seat in
the passenger coach a tired mountain
lion was again nailed up in its crate
and the train proceeded on its way

  pete sat on the extreme edge of a
chair wincing at every lurch of the car
and smoked his pipe in sullen silence
toby preferred to stand he said it was
more comfortable

  it was some time before either spoke
-apparently the desire for conversation
was lacking then toby pausing be-
fore the dozing animal in the crate
looked down at the floor and spoke in
measured tones

   the hypnotic power of the human
eye-

    cut it ordered pete briefly

  -can quell-

   any wild beast finished pete with
sudden inspiration  this one wasnt
wild and so-he leered at toby-
 the eve-power theory aint had a fair
test but so long as you wasnt afraid
it didnt matter anyway

            shattered dreams of earnest inventors who
            found after years of striving that their
            strange patents would not benefit railroading

 b v win t h r o p r  eliio t t

r a great many years the
united states patent office
required inventors to sub-
mit a working model of
their device with
their application
for a patent or one which
made its workings sufficiently
plain if a working model was
impossible

  with the growth of the
patent office this practise
speedily became cumbersome

models multiplied storage
became a problem and final-
ly the practise was aban-
doned save in exceptional
cases but one hundred and
sixty thousand models had al-
ready been stored cata-
logued and arranged at this
time moreover in certain
lines of unusual importance
models of foreign inven-
tions were included that the
 stale of the art as the
patent expert calls it might
be seen at a glance

  thus in the locomotive
cases the curious visitor
could see not only the be-
ginnings of american prac-
tise but compare these
models with stephensons
 racket the  p u ffi n g
billy of hadley and the
first model of richard i revi-
thick

  but congress in an eco-

nomical mood decided that paying rent
for a huge model hall was a useless ex-
pense the models had long since been
crowded from the patent office itself

richard c gill for forty-two years custodian ok the
models sent to the patent office at washington d c
ey aspiring inventors mr gill was born at middle-
bur ct virginia eight y-th ree years ago

and so ii was ordered that this unique
and wonderful collection of relics of
american inventions should he stored
away in boxes and preserved for pos-
terity in the caverns of the subcellars of
some new government buildings

  the curious visitor may no longer
compare the  rocket  with the  puff-
ing billy nor the ross winans locomo-
tive with the double combination freight

serve the care with which the ofien
dainty and sometimes wonderfully prac-
tical models were made nor stand in
rapt attention before a glass cage an i
muse on the oddness of the engineering
ideas of many an inventor now gone to
his reward 

  no more can be induce kilnrd c
giil custodian of the models whose pa-
tient care arranged and classified them
-nd whose knowledge of each one of ti
hundred and sixty thousand is as the
knowledge of a librarian of his books int 
opening cases for him that be may sec
finger and even photograph a rare
model

  not that mr gill b less obliging now
than then but now it takes days to gel
models from their present plight and
physical labor to shift cases and unpack
them also many of the delicate models

would not stand transportation very
well and the jarring and breakage inci-
dent to loading and unloading hea v
wooden cases full of delicate mechanism
has wrought ruin among many of them
therefore the accompanying photo-
graphs which the writer made himself
before the models were stored have the
unusual interest of being unique

  it is odd what contrasts time can
effect and what strange bedfellows in-
vention like politics may bring together
there was stephenson whose  rocket 
won an english prize of two thousand
five hundred dollars in open competition
with the locomotives of two other firms

  the  novelty  of john braithewait
and the  sanspareil  of timothy hack-
worth it had two eight-inch cylinders
with a stroke of y inches driving
wheels of the enormous size of  feet
sj inches weighed with its tender be-
tween  and s tons and could pull a
gross weight of  tons at the unheard
of speed of  miles an hour

  the indifferent will see in this only a
curious attempt to make a tractor differ-
ent from others but those who know
anything of the engineers history will
recognize the adaptation of a high-pres-
sure mine-pump to traction work

   ii was in  that trevithick built his
first high-pressure steam-engine and
two years later in s the first steam-
engine which ever pulled itself along
traveled over a road in cornwall in
 the locomotive illustrated ran over
a tramway in w ales hauling twenty tons
of iron the fire-box was in front so
that the engine had to be stopped in order
to  stoke up it had a safety valve
and the exhaust-pipe of the single up-
right cylinder led to the smoke-stack so
that its power might aid in the draft of
the fire

  all the beauties of the invention of

i	hn l whetstone of cincinnati who in
iii took out patent no  de-
signed for slow-moving freight and
more especially as a substitute of the
canal mule are not visible in the pic-
ture while the absence of any con-
necting-rods and their elimination by nu-
merous gear-wheels is a feature of the
engine its main claim to fame rests on
the fact that it is propelled not by trac-

  but if a photographers convenience
has made strange companions of ideas
both far distant in time and the place of
their birth consider the uniqueness of
bringing together in the pages of a maga-
zine devoted to the modern railway and
all its wonders two pictures of such
unique devices as those of a nicolls
patented in  and of cathcott pat-
ented in 

  both of these locomotives were de-
signed with the same end in view to
gain pulling power on grades at the ex-
pense of speed and to gain speed on the
levels at the expense of power

  they are really mult urn in parr a en-
gines-combination freight and express
motors-designed to save a poverty-
stricken railway company the ex-
pense of more than one engine when
two kinds of work were to be done

  the first seems to modern eyes
somewhat the more practical it is
nothing more than two engines run
from one boiler-one engine having
small driving-wheels for grades the
other larger driving-wheels for
express service

  in his patent mr nicolls set
forth the matter very plainly in-
deed albeit his reasoning takes
 cognizance of the matter of
leverage in considering the
diameter of his wheels and the

stroke of his piston but merely of the
speed of revolution he said

as heretofore constructed the locomo-
  tive steam-engine for railroads presents
  many very serious defects when ascend-
  ing grades it requires more power than
  when descending them or running on
  levels and yet from the nature
  of the general construction of
  locomotives as the resistance
  increases its power decreases
  and therefore instead of hav-
  ing an increase of power when
  ascending grades it actually has
  less from the fact that the in-
  creased resistance reduces the
  motion of the wheels and con-
  sequently that of the pistons
  and the power of the engine
  being due to the pressure of the
  steam ami the motion and area
  ot the pistons which latter represent the
  volumes of steam consumed in a given
  time it follows that the slower the pistons
  move the less power the engine will give
  out

   what are known as  large driving-
 wheels  possess advantages over small
 wheels which are admitted and known to
 engineers-such for instance as afford-
 ing the means of rapid motion without
 the necessity of gearing up as it is
 termed but when ascending grades their
 number of revolutions is greatly reduced
 which in turn greatly reduces the effective
 power of the steam and therefore renders
 the engine incapable of ascending grades
 with such a train as it is capable of draw-
 ing on levels

    the object of my invention is to remedy
  these evils and adapt the engine to the
  drawing of trains up the usual grades of
  railroads with the full effective power of
  the steam generated  and the nature of my
  invention by which i attain this important
  end consists in employing in addition to
  the usual large driving-wheels a set of
  small drivers operated by an additional
  pair of engines by this arrangement
  when the engine reaches moderate grades
  the steam can be shifted from the en-
  gines of the large drivers to those of
  the small drivers

with small and large drivers so it could be
operated independently for freight
and passenger service

no  in  so very odd indeed
is tliis conception that it is rather diffi-
cult to describe it without a full set of
working drawings and many complicated
letters figures and diagrams

  although the picture shows no cylin-
ders there are two-one under the boiler
and one under the tender the tender
bv the way is an integral part of the
locomotive and is not simplv coupled
to it

hackworth to
oppose stephen-
sons rocket
in an open com-
petition for a
prize of two
thousand five
hundred dollars

of

  the difference in the diameter of the
two sets will enable the pistons that
operate the small drivers to work off all
 he steam generated in the boiler and to
i-xert the required force to draw the train
up the grade although with a reduced
speed and when ascending grades of
greater inclination both sets of engines
and drivers may he brought into requisi-
tion and thus the locomotive adapted to
all tin- circumstances of the road and ren-
dered effective in carrying trains over the
whole length of the road without waste of
power

 mr cathcotts invention gets at the
 same result in another wav lie had two

sets of drivers-a large pair and a small
pair-both connected to the same cylin-
ders with the same connecting-rod he
employed a variation of the jack-screw
to raise from the track that pair which
he did not wish to use letting the other
pair take the weight of the engine

  thus when he wished to start a
heavily laden train or go up a steep
grade what could be simpler than to
jack ti the large drivers and let down
the small ones the large drivers would
then revolve idly in the air and as may
easilv be seen the distance the drivers
need he raised is very small

  similarly when speed was an object
- say when the train was ten minutes
late or the track level and the wind be-
hind-it would be but a matter of a few
minutes to screw up the small drivers
and let them do the idle revolving while
the large drivers carried the whole for-
ward at twenty miles an hour

  but the prize for the oddest of odd
locomotive patents which ever wiggled
through the patent office must be given
to e k johnson who took out patent

brake-beam sort of construction and con-
necting-rods are connected with huge
spur gears which interlock thus keeping
the pistons always in the same relation
to each other

  from these gear-wheels other con-
necting-rods work the drivers of which
there are eight-four under the forward
truck and four under the tender

  now the remarkable part of the in-
vention is this when it is desired to
reverse this engine the position of the
drivers with reference to each other is
altered by means of a worm and seg-
ment motion not shown in the model be-
cause operated underneath

  the wheels are mounted loose on the
trucks proper with roller bearings so
that when the engine is stationary the
worm and segment may drag the wheels
forward in the trucks sufficiently to
bring the connecting-rods to the top if
they are at the bottom or to the bottom
if they are  top

  thus if the position of the engine
when it stops is such that a push on the
piston will propel the engine forward


railroad mans magazine

and it is desired to go backward the
worm and segment is manipulated and
the position of the wheels and connect-
ing-rod altered without moving the pis-
tons so that the same push on the piston
would operate the engine backward

  in the early days of steam as applied
to railways there was less consideration
given to operating expense and to the
comfort of passengers than there is to-
day those early engineers had the
world before them where to choose and
chose almost anything they desired-at
least on paper and with patents hence
the beautiful ross winarts model of a
street-car locomotive made in  in
which a short-coupled effect is obtained
by having the connecting-rod w rk a
crank and gear the other end of which
system works the drivers

  the long stroke and great radius of
crank is thus obtained in half the dis-
tance ordinarily required note the

careful wood covering of the boiler and
the cylinder and the neat brass railing
which surrounds the platform where the
combined driver and fireman was sup-
posed to hold forth for this was for
city use and of course must be neater
and more attractive than the iron horses
of the country rails

  a tribute must be paid this model
maker for this is a practical working
model and most beautifully made even
now many a year after its construction
it works smoothly and evenly to the
touch-more so alas than the full-sized
engine ever did for even as the flower
of which the poet sang so sweetlv full
many a patent is born to die unseen un-
known and untried of the two hun-
dred thousand and more in the patent

	ftice which never got any further than
models and an inventors dream of
wealth this and many like it in the rail-
way division are by  means the least

horse-power and electricity

while most electrical apparatus is
rated in terms of electrical units
it is customary to express the ca-
pacity of electric motors in terms of the
horse-power and this unit consequently lias
great importance ami interest for electrical
engineers it is not generally realized that
the term horse-power as it lias usually been
defined does not represent a definite am tint
of power since the value of the unit varies
from place to place

  the horse-power is usually defined as
representing the performance of 
foot-pounds of work per minute and a
foot-pound is defined as the work done in
raising a mass of one pound a vertical dis-
tance of one foot this makes the horse-
power depend upon the gravitational force
acting upon a mass of one pound and it is
well known that the gravitational force va-
ries with the latitude and with the altitude
above the earths surface while this vari
ation only amounts to a fraction of one
per cent it is nevertheless quite an ap-
preciable value and it would seem highly
desirable that this important unit should be
so defined that its value is quite definite and
everywhere the same

  the standards committee of the ameri-
can institute of klectrical engineers has

a opted the value of g watts as repre-
senting a horse-power as the electrical
units have been legally defined and repre-
sent more definite values than the mechani-
cal unit here involved it seems very de-
sirable to define the horse-power in terms
of electrical units and thus give it a more
definite value than it has had in the past
the value of the horse-power has never
been fixed by statute in this country and
if the necessity for the legal determination
of its value should arise it is probable that
the common definiti stated above would
be the one recognized

  a legal enactment of a new and exact
definition is therefore highly desirable since
an agreement for use or even a general
adoption by all electrical engineers would
not give a new definition any legal force
or effect

  it would be highly desirable if all power
whether electrical mechanical or thermal
in its nature were expressed in terms of
watts or kilowatts but since it can hardly
be expected that men in all walks of life
will be willing to abandon the more gene-
rally used unit of horse-power for the elec-
trical unit it seems highly important to de-
fine the former in terms of the more pre-
cise value of the latter-electrical review

indifference is a broken rail on the main line of effort

before daybreak to take the  a ten-
wheeled compound out  a circus extra
he went to his boarding-house to get his
overalls and dinner-pail before going to the
roundhouse

  after coupling up jim looked back and
noticed that the head car was an unusually
large one with an opening in the forward
end covered with canvas

  they had run about eight miles when
the injector-check broke and jim told the
fireman to go back and see how much water
there was in the tank

   not a drop exclaimed the fireman in
astonishment when he returned to the deck

   we had a full tank at the roundhouse
said jim

   yes the tank was full because the
roundhouse flunky ran water over the sides
and got his feet wet answered the fire-
man

   well well have to cut off and run for
water that is all there is to that replie 
jim  le shut off and applied the air com-
ing to a stop the fireman got down and cut
her oft and they started for the nearest
water-tank

  they were soon back  their train-and
 their way after running about fifteen
miles the injector broke the second time

  go back and look at the water again
said jim to the fireman

   shes dry again said the fireman on
scrambling over the coal

   well ill be hanged if  can understand
this i looked the tank over before we left
and there wasnt a sign of a leak said jim
with a perplexed look

the fireman hail twice told  not a drop
they cut oft and ran to lennox for the

the day was just breaking after the brake-

day

   there is a hose  the tank and water
is shooting out of it like a water-spoilt
exclaimed the drenched fireman a few min-
utes later coming into the cab

   spirits shouted the trainmaster get-
ting down from the firemans seat-box just
in time to get a dose of water from the
back of the tank

the dismal desert landscape he had
plenty of material for meditation for to
achieve ugliness had been the ambition
of his degenerate life and in that at
least he had not failed

  the chicago stock-yards had known
and cleansed themselves of him the
freight-vards had feared him and clark
street had conceded him  tough his
meditations took him back-far back
into those old days when his reputation
as an  ugly guy  was just emerging
from the hoodlum state of youth to the
deeper criminality of manhood

  mis thorough ugliness unstrained by
pity or regard untinged even in the
most casual affairs by any light of com-
mon courtesy made him a thing to be
feared and hated even where ugliness
was a weapon of survival yet snarler
was judicious in his reputation building
those whose ugliness he feared might
match his own in a show-down were
never invited to a show-down

  on this principle lie had chosen a wife
-a little woman who had married him
because she had feared to refuse him
and whom he had married because of the
delicious pleasure that fear gave him

  but its the boy jim with whom this
story is chiefly concerned the snarler
had built up fond hopes of being mighty
proud of jim for at an early age jim
showed himself an apt pupil in the les-
sons of ugliness which his fond parent
constantly instilled indeed if the snarler
could but have understood it there was
something back of the boys ugliness in-
finitely more to be dreaded than the slvil-
low viciousness of his own the subtle
quality called character - whether good
or bad-perhaps was in the making

  but the snarler did not understand it
he saw the youngsters formidable
strength and utter lack of feeling as he
shouldered his way surlily through the
rough life of the chicago slums and
encouraged and applauded and then
came the shock

  	hie day the time in the estimation of
the snarler being ripe for more definite
instruction in the training of his off-
spring lie had broached unto jim the
pulling of a pretty bit of villainy which
was to nourish his own empty exchequer
and start the young man upon his nat-
ural career

  the boy listened until the man was

through his eyes  the ground and his
accustomed scowl knitting his brow
then he looked up

  thats thieving aint it lie in-
quired

  the snarler was a little taken aback
for a moment to qualify things had
never occurred to him

   sure mike he said uneasily

   then count me out growled jim
and started to walk away

  whats the matter sneered his
father i thought you called yourself
a tough guy

  the boy turned  that aint being
tough he said  thats being crooked
and he walked away

  so the kid refused his career and the
snarler after hiding his disgust in three
days of oblivion resumed his with the
careful cowardice of the petty sneak-
thief

  but at length there came a time when
tempted by a seemingly easy opportunity
into larger operation cowardice over-
reached care and the trail became too
hot for the snarlers peace of mind and
so with simple cunning he had pulled the
trick that saved him and sent his son to
jail

  certainly it was upon ugliness that the
snarler meditated as lie plugged doggedly
alongside the railroad track night drew
in and in the distance he saw against the
dark sky the panting glare of an engines
exhaust

  ten minutes later he had swung him-
self thankfully into an open box car he
struck a match to find his bearings and
found himself staring into the barrel of
a big revolver too dazed to do anything
but hold the match and glare fixedly at
the peering face in front of him

  the other came to his relief with a
short laugh  thats all right bo said
lie   thought maybe you was a shack
an ill put a shacks light out before ill
hit the ties and starve in this desert im
a tough guy i am

   i dont blame you agreed the
snarler  t was kicked off myself yes-
terday after id lost my gun if i
hadnt lost it-im a tough guy myself
lie finished significantly

  overhead there was the sound of
heavy shoes they listened then there
was the flicker of a light with easy
strength a brakeman had swung himself
ihe ugly

into the car his lantern slung by a string
around his neck

   hit the gravel he growled as he
held the light on them

    heat it snapped the tramp pushing
his big gun into the foreground

  but it was kelly on whom the brake-
mans eyes rested and he lowered his
lantern quickly

    beat it dye hear again ordered
the gunman

  suddenly the brakeman dropped to one
knee like a flash his hand was in and
out of his overalls pocket the gun-
mans bullet went high and passed
through the open door but the trainmans
shot took the other between the eyes and
he lurched forward-dead

circle	

   ith hardly a look at him the brake-
man turned his gun upon the snarler

  turn around an put your hands be-
hind your back he ordered unlooping
the rope from his lantern

  the snarler laughed a trifle uneasily
and sheepishly

  whats the matter jim said he
 dont you know your old dad you
sure are an ugly guy

 and jim put his face close to his
fathers  you bet i know you an
you bet im an ugly guy you trained
me in ugliness an im learning every
day your names scratched  this gun
an theres a sheriff at the next stop its
an ugly circle an youve drew it your-
self turn around

a wizard of wrecks

           h w belknap chief inspector of safety appliances
           scientifically investigates railroad disasters to help
           the government eliminate the causes of accidents

by richardson davenport

cience began when man
 learned that to prevent the re-
 currence of any series of
 phenomena - disease explo-
 sion anything-he had to go
 back of the apparent facts
 and search for the cause

  the government believes that a scien-
tific study of wrecks and their causes
will result in great direct benefit to the
railroads and to the public at large

  hence that division of the interstate
commerce commission which concerns
itself with the enforcement of the safety-
appliance law the hours-of-labor law
and the air-brake law and also interests
itself in wrecks of all kinds

  the chief inspector of safety-appli-
ances is mr h y belknap if you
walk into his rooms in a down-town busi-
ness building in the city of washington
you are more likely than not to be met
with the information that  mr belknap
is awav investigating a wreck for he not
only has charge of twenty-nine other in-
spectors but he himself investigates
wrecks wherever possible more espe-
cially lie devotes his personal attention
to those catastrophes which are made the
subject of investigations by state rail-
road commissions and so accurate are
his methods and so far-reaching his re-
sults that he has brought about a spirit
of cooperation between his department
and state commissions

  if you find mr belknap at home
you will see a full-faced hearty-man-
nered man who looks you straight in the
eve has a handshake that means some-

thing and who has  railroad man 
written large all over him

  oh we are all railroad men in this
work he says  a man must have at
least eight years practical railroad ex-
perience behind him before we will con-
sider his application for the position of
inspector on my staff i have former
superintendents trainmasters air-brake
instructors road foremen of engines
despatchers-why i spent fifteen years
on a railroad before i was appointed an
inspector and when i did get the appoint-
ment  walked off a train and into
office

    my people are all railroad people
when your mothers people have been
railroad men and your fathers people
were railroad men you grow up in a
railroad atmosphere  started as a teleg-
rapher but the forty a month didnt
look so gocd when i found brakemen
getting fifty-five and sixty and con-
ductors more and i wasnt long getting
over the wheels myself

   this is a practical department and
while theory has an important place we
believe that every man on the work must
have practical first-hand knowledge of
railroad work

  it was ill  that the safetv-appliance
law was passed the five years given
railroads to comply was extended to
seven years-and then a seven months
extension was given so that it was not
until ii that safetv-appliance inspec-
tion became a necessity mr belknap
came  duty in  when he was one
of twelve inspectors as he became chief
a wizard of wrecks	

inspector in july of  he added eight
years as an inspector to his fifteen years
practical experience before he took
charge of the work

the whole countrv is divided into lif-

man for more than sixteen hours con-
tinuously these are also under mr
belknaps command

perhaps the most important work that
air belknap does is that of accident in-

 w belknap whose official title is chief inspector of safety
appliances and whose duty is to investigate every wreck
and make a detailed report to the interstate
commerce commission

ihotifgaplt by harris ewing washington p c

teen districts in each of which are two
inspectors lo see that the provisions of
the safety-appliance and the air-braks
laws are carried out in addition there
are six inspectors to keep track of the
enforcement of the hours-of-service law
which prohibits the employment of any

vestigation which is made possible by the
law of that name enacted in 

   the most vital part of this act is its
 third section which is quoted in full

   the interstate commerce commission
   shall have authority to investigate all col-
   lisions derailments or other accidents re-


railroad mans magazine

  stilling in serious injury to person or to
  the property of a railroad occurring on
  the line of any common carrier engaged in
  interstate or foreign commerce by railroad
  the commission or any impartial investi-
  gator thereunto authorized by said com-
  mission shall have authority to investi-
  gate such collisions derailments or other
  accidents aforesaid and all the attending
  facts conditions and circumstances and
  for that purpose may subpoena witnesses
  administer oaths take testimony and re-
  quire the production of books papers
  orders memoranda exhibits and other
  evidence and shall be provided by said
  carriers with all reasonable facilities
  provided that when such accident is in-
  vestigated by a commission of the state
  in which it occurred the interstate com-
  merce commission shall if convenient
  make any investigation it may have previ-
  ously determined upon at the same time
  as and in connection with the state com-
  mission investigation said commission
  shall when it deems it to tbe public in-
  terest make reports of such investigations
  staling the cause of accident together with
  such recommendations as it deems proper
  such reports shall be made public in such
  manner as the commission deems proper

  some of these reports are very elab-
orate for instance there is the report
of the investigation of an accident on the
creat northern which is illustrated with
twenty-six photographs showing the
steel-rail investigations of the engineer-
physicist of the bureau of standards it
is only slightly less elaborate than the
report of an investigation of an accident
on the lehigh valley illustrated with
twenty-nine really remarkable pictures
both of steel rails rail-tests and the acci-
dent itself sometimes these reports de-
velop facts which have a wide public ap-
peal for instance the report of the in-
vestigation of an accident on the chi-
cago milwaukee and st paul shows both
in text and pictures the enormous per-
centage of safety in favor of steel cars

must find the real cause

  in addition to the special reports
issued there are the accident bulletins
which cover the investigations for periods
of three months at a time giving in brief
the result of all wreck investigations of
mr belknap and his inspectors

  all these publications can be obtained
for a nominal fee ten cents usually
from the superintendent of documents at
the government printing-office and a cer-
tain proportion of the edition is reserve

for free distribution to those interested in
the work

  the power of the inspectors at a
wreck is exactly as is stated in the law
they cannot order a railroad to do any-
thing or leave anything undone they
cannot discover a cause of a wreck and
issue instructions that this cause must
be removed in the future they can only
observe take testimony and have expert
investigation and advice when necessary
to find out the absolute reason for any
accident

  the  reason  does not stop with find-
ing out that a train was ditched because
a rail was broken if it was a broken
rail why was it broken how long had
it been in service who made it and
when and how what was its formula
could a fault have been detected in the
rail with proper inspection what par-
ticular form of rail disease caused the
break was it pipe  was it frac-
tured by high-wheel pressure was it
improperly laid 

make steel tell its story

  all such questions regarding struc-
tural conditions in the steel rail are
turned over to the bureau of standards
where the steel rail itself is made to tell
its own story to men who know steel and
rails as you who read know the faces
and the minds of your friends in in-
vestigations outside of the domain of
mere railroad experience the inspector
gives way to the chemist to the metallur-
gist to the testing engine and the analy-
sis so that in the end the real cause is
determined

  if the reader wonders how this work
can be effective with  power over rail-
ways to compel them to make the neces-
sary changes in equipment or operation
which will prevent accidents let him con-
sider the following case it is chosen
because the railway  which the wreck-
occurred is a small obscure one and
would not ordinarily get the same pub-
licity as would attend a similar accident
 any of the large systems in this case
the wreck was not caused by lack of
equipment a broken rail failure of sig-
nals or running a red light but by the
failure or rather absence of any method
in operation of the road

the wreck in question was on the
a wizard of wrecks



ligonier valley railway july  of this
year it resulted in the death of nineteen
people with twenty-eight others injured

  the investigation developed the fact
that this little railroad was not run ac-
cording to standard rules the report
showed that the railroad was a single-
track line extending from latrobe penn-
sylvania to ligonier a distance of ten
and a half miles the branch  which
the accident occurred known as the mill
creek branch is also a single-track line
extending from ligonier to wilpen a
distance of three and a half miles with
several spur-tracks leading to coal-mines
and coke-ovens

kept no record of orders

  its passenger-service consists of two
round-trips each week-day starting at
ligonier the freight-service is the
hauling of empty cars to the mines and
coke-ovens the necessary switching and
returning the loaded cars to ligonier

  the passenger-trains  this branch
are not numbered there is no block-
signal system of any kind train-move-
ments are governed by orders given by
the despatcher to the conductor either
verbally or by telephone who gives them
to the engineer and the other members
of his crew there is no record of train-
orders  train-register is maintained
and the road has  printed rules govern-
ing train-operation

  the accident was a misunderstanding
or a failure to obey verbal orders one
train was to meet another at a certain
point the other train was not held
they met-with a combination - car
carrying passengers in front of the pas-
senger-locomotive-and the result was a
holocaust mr belknap in closing his
report found

    this accident was caused either by the
  failure of the despatcher to deliver or of
  the conductor of the passenger-train to
  understand or obey the order requiring
  the latter to hold his train at ligonier
  until the freight-train arrived the weight
  of evidence as given by the employees
  seems to be with the despatcher and the
  conclusion is therefore reached that the
  conductor is responsible for this collision
  either by his failure to understand or by
  his failure to obey the order delivered to
  him by the despatcher the whole matter
  however is a question of veracity between
  the conductor on the one hand and the

     fr

  despatcher and other employees on the
  other hand since there is   written
  record of the order involved

    as previously stated the combination-
  car was being handled ahead of the en-
  gine this is an extremely dangerous
  manner of carrying passengers there
  was ample opportunity of turning this
  train at ligonier so that this car could
  have been handled behind the engine in-
  stead of in front of it had this been
  done and there seems to have been no
  excuse whatever for its not having been
  done there would undoubtedly have been
  a material reduction in the loss of life
  attending this accident

    the method of train-operation on this
  road is extremely faulty and until some
  adequate rules governing train-operation
  are adopted and enforced accidents of
  this character are liable to occur

  while neither mr belknap nor his in-
spectors nor his department have power
to enforce the obviously needed reforms
they have authority under the law to
make public their findings

  the publication of this report the fact
that a passenger-carrying railroad was
operating in defiance of modern train-
practise in a way which is more like the
beginnings of transportation than the year
 could not help but arouse such a
storm of public protest and feeling as to
result immediately in a correction of the
abuses it cost nineteen lives but even
with that cost without the government
investigation and the resultant publicity
the evils might have continued

    railroads assist at investigations

 a feature of mr belknaps work
which makes a wide popular appeal is
the cooperation between the railways and
the department in an endeavor to find the
truth

 the railway is as anxious to know
what causes its accidents as is the public
or the department wrecks are not
profitable to railways and because the
law wisely states that the result of the
investigation cannot be admitted as evi-
dence in any suit or action for damages
the railway knows that it is not hurting
itself by getting at the whole truth

  if a railway has  piped rails  laid in
ignorance it wants to know why if a
rail was cut to lit a new frog and the
cutting developed a split web it wants
to know why the rail was retained if
a railway is running trains too fast for


railroad mans magazine

the size and kind of rails it lias bought
so that the wheel-pressure and the cold
rolling of the steel are bound to cause
broken rails in time it wants to know
why if its signal-system is not working
or failed to work or could not work or
is defective it wants to get at the reasons
and the inspectors want to help

  in the file-cases in mr belknaps office
are the most complete data and docu-
ments imaginable regarding wrecks
their causes and results and whenever
any good end will be served the whole re-
port often including dozens of most
illuminating photographs is published
for the benefit of all other railroads and
for the moral effect of the molding of
public opinion  the railroad most inti-
mately concerned

   we try to get on the spot right
away said mr belknap  there is 
investigation like one made on the spot
and at the time and that is what we try
to do i go personally to every wreck

of importance that i can and between us
all and the cooperation the state com-
missions and the railroads themselves
give us we are collecting such data as
we hope will in time show us all what
must be done to stop accidents-or the
greater part of them-and make railroad
travel the safest of all transportation

  that of course is a development of
the future mr belknap and his in-
spectors are gathering the data finding
the causes laying the foundation

  you have only to have a look at mr
belknap and five minutes conversation
with him to feel that when he leaves the
remains of a wreck with the belief that
he knows all about its cause he docs
know about it no theorist governs
other theorists in this work but a prac-
tical experienced railway man directing
other practical experienced railway men
finding out the reason for those catas-
trophes which are of utmost concern to
railways railway men and public alike

remarkable records of firemen

 we have some data which i believe
       is fundamental on the subject of

         firemen said c d young en-
gineer of tests of the pennsylvania railroad
at the recent master mechanics convention
 it has been worked up with that in view
and i believe it would be interesting to the
association to know what has been done by
firemen proving at least what can be done
and then from those figures perhaps we
might be able to judge what an average
man might be expected to do

   last summer and fall some capacity
tests were run between ft wayne and val-
paraiso a distance of  miles the idea
being to determine just how many cars
could be hauled on a given schedule speed
everything was in good shape for the ex-
perimental work the road foreman

recommended a man who has broken all
records in handling fuel on a locomotive
he had fired for three hours at speeds
greater than sixty miles an hour an aver-
age of  pounds of coal per hour not
only did he do that but he would go back
and do it again his work was done with
a no  shovel had he been given a larger
shovel i believe he could have exceeded
those figures we have had men  our
locomotive test plant fire as high as 
pounds of coal per hour

   now these are maximum figures i be-
lieve you will agree with me that we should
not expect much more we know time
and again men who are firing  pounds
of coal per hour for a six or eight-hour run
 the road anil they are doing all we can
reasonably expect for a single fireman

engines were saw-mills

when the old  h n jose  was in
her prime nearly all the maine cen-
tral locomotives burned wood at
every station you would sec enormous
woodsheds open  the side piled full of
wood to saw this enormous quantity of
wood that the oll wood-lnirners used to
eat they had regular sawing machines so
arranged that they could shift the gear and
propel themselves from station to station
the crews lived in a house-car the fore-

man acted as conductor and usually the
wife of one of the crew went with them as
cook how queer they would look travel-
ing over the rails of a modern road haul-

daring death on the
great lakes

    when the turbulent inland seas had taken their toll of
    railroad heroes j b ashley an obscure engineer in-
    vented a steel boat that defies the most forbidding ice floe

by hugh c weir

nd what became of the
  other thirty-seven i
  asked i realized in-
  stinctively however
   that his silence was elo-
  quent answer

  for a moment johnson stared out
over the gray-white ice-field of the
frozen detroit

   they went to the bottom with the
cars  he said  luck saved two of us
when we had all said our last prayer 
-i happened to be one 

  he drew out an age-colored brier
scooped it through a rubber pouch and
shaded a match over its bowl a spiral
of blue smoke curled into the winter air
his eyes were still fixed grimly on the
ice

  i dont know what pictures the pipe
smoke suggested to him but for my
part the dock-scene had vanished and in
its place i saw the storm-lashed waters
of lake michigan beneath dark scudding
clouds a great boat rolling under a death-
blow of the elements thirty runaway
freight-cars crashing over her slippery
deck and her crew exhausted by the
losing battle preparing for another and
more desperate fight for life as the ves-
sel took her last plunge

  let me tell you of the foundering of
the pere marquette no xs as johnson
told me on the detroit dock it was not
only a great marine disaster it was also
a great railroad disaster the story will
show you that the struggles and hazards

 of the american railroad man are not
 confined to the land railroading on the
 water does this sound impossible

   the steel car-ferry pere marquette
 no  departed on her last voyage
 across the ice-churned waters of lake
 michigan in the late fall of  loaded
 with thirty coal-cars

   on the great lakes the railroad man
 does not reach his terminal because the
 road-bed stops and a hundred or two
 hundred miles of water stretch before
 him he swings his train out onto the
 deck of a waiting steel ferry-boat
 anchors his cars on a floating track and
 in from ten to -twenty hours runs his
 train onto the other shore to continue on
 its way

   the pere marquette disaster occurred
 in the days before the ice-ferries in the
 closing week of lake navigation when the
  little ice devils  of superior were giv-
 ing the crews of the belated freighters
 all-night battles the  soo  was
 choking up for its five-months blockade
 and the advance guard of the winter
 storms was leaving a trail of marine dis-
 aster from duluth to buffalo

doubly so to a boat with a freight-train
on board a string of runaway coal-
cars is a grim proposition on land with
a clear track ahead but in a november
gale in the middle of lake michigan-
well you may think you have been
through some nerve-racking moments
when your train has broken in two on
a mountain grade and you have crowded
on ever ounce of steam to escape from
the plunging cars behind you and are
not quite sure whether the agent at the
station ahead will have sense enough to
set the switch right for you or not

cars plunging over the deck

  if however you should be transported
to a great lakes ferry in the teeth of a
sixty-mile gale - the wind sometimes
blows eight- miles on our inland seas-
with a leak in the bottom and the pump-
gangs working like demons and the
water freezing into six-inch ice on the
rails and then should hear the alarm that
half a dozen of the freight-cars on board
had broken loose and were crashing
through the side and carrying the boats
last hope with them it is quite probable
that you would consider your previous
estimate of excitement bromidically
tame

  such was the situation that confronted
the crew of pere marquette no 
after battling for six hours with a gale
whistling down from the michigan pine
woods captain kilty saw his last hope
fade every pump on board had been
working for three hours and every
available man was stationed on the car-
deck to watch the fastenings of the
chain-anchored gondolas but there are
winds and waves before which chain-
links cannot hold

  a regiment of howling demons seemed
to be suddenly unloosed from the storm-
mist the boat reeled farther and
farther before a wall of white-crested
water towering triumphantly over her
the men huddled about the freight-cars
flung themselves toward the chains and
then even above the wail of the wind
came the crunching of wheels torn from
their fastenings a human shriek of
agony and two forty-ton cars were
plunging over the shadowy deck

  three men were crushed into lifeless
heaps before the second of the runaway

gondolas dashed into the water the
nightmare of the unequal battle for the
life of no  had only begun two
after compartments of the vessel had
been flooded from the leaks and it was
evident that the weight of the remaining
cars was rapidly sinking the boat the
only hope lay in deliberately casting off
the fastenings of the other gondolas
and rolling them over the fan-tailed
stern

  with the deck rocking at an incredible
angle and the waves sweeping its entire
length at intervals of three minutes the
odds against the crew can be appreciated
but captain kiltys call for volunteers
met with instant response the chains
of the first car were cautiously loosened
and the huge gondola pushed down the
track to the stern

  the forward wheels cleared the edge
but the body descended with a crash to
the deck and hung suspended even the
next wall of waves failed to move it
as the water receded the men threw
themselves with the fury of desperation
into the task of dislodging the cars pon-
derous bulk muscles strained over
crowbars with a strength which never
could have been exerted under normal
circumstances but it was a fight for
life with a final reluctant sway the
car toppled to the sterns edge-hung
again for a heart-straining second-and
then disappeared into the foaming
waters

hung over edge into water

  the danger was passed but only for
the moment with each of the remain-
ing cars the ordeal was repeated it was
comparatively easy to force the front
wheels to the edge but the weight of the
car was such that it was invariably sus-
pended midway the energy of the
crew seemed tireless from one nerve-
tearing tussle they turned without a mur-
mur to the next before half of the
track of plunging cars had been cleared
however it was apparent that the vessel
was doomed the majority of the pas-
sengers were placed in the life-boats

  captain kilty turned abruptly as the
last boat was ready

   johnson he ordered  you and
murphy take the oars 

  therailroad men of the car-fernes
daring death on the great lakes



are also sailors in a rudimentary way
johnson hesitated it seemed almost
like desertion the captain repeated his
order more curtly there was nothing
to do but obey that was how johnson
escaped

  twenty minutes later the death-quiver
shot through no  her stern dropped
down under the seething waves and she
sank to her place in the graveyard of
the great lakes it is a significant fact
that when she took her last plunge all
but two of the gondolas on her car-deck
had been pushed into the water it is
such slender margins that hold the issues
of life and death for the car-ferry men
of the lakes

  another stirring lake tragedy was that
of the marquette bessemer ferry no 
in december of  in the early part
of the month with one of the furious
gales of lake erie threatening she left
conneaut ohio for her seventy-mile
trip to port stanley ontario three
days of lashing storm followed - three
days with no word from the ferry and
its thirty-two coal-cars

railroaders frozen at the oars

  her sister ship bessemer no  after
sixty hours of battling with the waves
brought her cargo into port in safety-
and at once started on the trail of the
missing craft a cordon of other vessels
were patrolling the lake from conneaut
to buffalo the car-ferry was not the
only boat overdue

  a dozen others were missing as a grim
aftermath of the storm

  gradually hope for the ferrv was
abandoned but the disappointed search-
ers still clung to the forlorn chance that
the crew had escaped in the life-boats

  on december  the pennsylvania
state fisheries tug commodore perry
churned her way out of erie harbor 
a final quest suddenly off against the
gray horizon a bobbing grean speck was
sighted through the glasses slowly it
developed into the outlines of a yawl
above its water-line appeared the name
of the missing car-ferry

  as the commodore perry approached
the forms of nine men were distinguished
sitting grimlv erect several with their
hands still gripping the motionless oars
a hoarse voice shot across the water to-

ward them through the speaking-trumpet
of the commodore perry there was
 answer although they were within
easy speaking range it was apparent
that the occupants of the drifting yawl
were making absolutely  effort to in-
tercept the tug they retained the stolid-
ly erect positions in which they had first
been sighted

tried to call dead to life

 the commodore perry swerved her
course squarely before the bow of the
smaller boat still the nine men made
no sign the master of the tug raised
his speaking-tube impatiently

   hello down there you idiots cant
you see-

  the trumpet dropped from his hands
he was speaking to the dead

  the drifting yawl was a funeral-boat
her occupants were frozen solidly to the
craft in which they had made their last
despairing struggle for life 

  as the commodore perry bore into
erie harbor with her ghastly charge in
tow i was one of the horror-numbed
crowd pressed about the dock-front
the men from the foundered car-ferry
had not been disturbed as a matter of
fact it required hours to remove their
bodies from the grip of ice there was
nothing of the repellent shock however
which one might have expected in a view
of such a death-cargo the flush of
health still glowed  the faces of the
men several lay with their hands under
their heads staring up at the pitiless
winter sky

  there was only one detail suggesting
the last ghastly hours that they had
faced on the storm-driven lake in the
bow of the boat was a little heap of
clothing - overalls jumper overcoat
every one of the occupants of the craft
was completely attired

ashley proves a prediction

  the only explanation of the extra gar-
ments was that ten men had occupied the
boat and that one of the number crazed
by the exposure and suffering had flung
off his clothes and sought a suicides
death in the water

ever brought to shore the story of her

 last struggle is another of the mysteries
 -of the great lakes whether in the
 fury of the gale her freight-cars were
 torn from their anchors and battered her
 to destruction will never be known it
 is of course the logical explanation

   a struggling engineer-a railroad man
of the west with all of the virile enthu-
siasm of the west-once sent a frantic
message for financial aid to the astors
he was building the toledo and ann
arbor railroad and his optimism painted
glowing returns from the enterprise
the astors sent back a curt refusal the
bald effect of which was youre
crazy how are you going to run a
train across lake michigan-tunnel it or
bridge it  

   i am trying to do both  he
answered

  the engineer was j b ashley and
the railroad world to-day counts the to-
ledo and ann arbor line of his construc-
tion one of the greatest engineering suc-
cesses of the united states he carries
his trains across lake michigan on every
day in the year wonderful as it may
seem he has made good his prediction of
both tunneling and bridging in other
words he has constructed a three-hun-
dred-and-fifty-foot floating tunnel of
steel capable of holding a train of thirty-
two cars and making the sixty to one
hundred mile passage across lake michi-
gan through two feet of ice

    ice demons  the railroad men of the
 great lakes call ashleys steel car-fer-
 ries if you are sufficiently adventurous
 you can take passage on one of them any
 day in the winter with the lake frozen
 ahead of you and can count on an aver-
 age siced of eight miles an hour until
 you make the other shore

battle of steel and ice

  imagine a twin-screw steamer of
from three hundred to four hundred feet
in length five thousand tons of steel
plates have gone into the making of her
hull below her upper deck you will
search in vain for a sign of wood even
the flooring of her upper deck is of naked
steel between this impregnable steel
covering a veritable tunnel stretches a
double railroad-track on this track are
clamped thirty-two freight-cars loaded
to capacity

  on the upper deck you can see that
the ice extends  all sides in huge fiat
iloes perhaps these will grind together
with a sullen roar and you will see hard
white ice-ridges piled up to a height of
maybe twenty feet above the water you
shake your head dubiously for a boat
to attempt a passage across the frozen
lake seems absurd

  the captain however smiles confi-
dently the achievements of the car-
ferries are an old story to him

  out into the harbor the vessel churns
shaping an undaunted course into the
thick of the ice-packs and now you
can see more details of her curious con-
struction her hull throughout is made
of steel plates seven-eigluhs of an inch
thick at every assailable point in the
neighborhood of her water line these
plates are doubled and reenforced by
steel beams

forcing her way through floe

  even this protection is not sufficient
a three-foot layer of cement concrete
has been built about her stern and for a
distance along her keel the only open-
ings in the hull the deadlights eight
inches wide and made of glass one-inch
thick are covered with heavy iron cast-
ings her designer has builded with an
alert eye on the menace of the ice

  mans ingenuity however has not yet
been exhausted in her construction her
bows are wreathed in swirling steam
from long hoses of boiling water at-
tached to her boilers and the ice crust-
ing about her sides and already begin-
ning  to hold her down by the head is
melted into foaming rivulets

  fairly cleared of the ice-crust the
ferry begins to show her heels in the
most adverse conditions she lias dem-
onstrated a speed of eight miles an hour
and has even attained fourteen miles
when the lake in a measure has been
clear 

  suddenly a tense breath of excitement
thrills through the vessel it is as
though every member of the crew is
mentally bracing himself for a shock
and then it comes

  the white ice of the first encircling
windrow crashes against the bow the
blow is so great that the heavy hull
thrums like a guitar hurled to the floor
daring death on the great lakes



  her curiously sloping stern designed
for just such contact shoots upward
and then downward the ice-floe is
shattered as by a pile-driver and jagged
lumps swirl through the air in a shower
of line needlelike slivers the boats
twelve-foot propeller is churning the
open water the vessel grinds onward
with the doggedness of a football player
hurtling into an opposing line-and then
she comes to a quivering gasping pause
her momentum has been exhausted
into the solid field of ice she has forced
her way nearly two hundred feet

boats defy frigid tempests

  the ashley steel car-ferries are man-
made marvels of thrilling possibilities
fancy a -ton boat with a cargo of
 tons crunching her way through an
ice-field of one hundred miles and yet
car-ferry trips have been common dur-
ing the past two winters  lake michi-
gan where the crew never sighted really
open water

  if you journey farther northward to
the straits of mackinac you will be
dazed even more here the two veteran
ferries are the st ignace and the ste
marie the mackinac straits in their
winter tempests rival the polar seas
from lake huron on the south and east
and lake michigan on the west heavy
floes are hurled into the channel in a
grinding fury crashing together until
they sometimes rise thirty feet above the
surface and often extending down a
distance of one hundred and fifty feet
below the water-line

  the question of maintaining an all-
winter channel against these odds was
the problem that confronted ashley
many an engineer would have given up
in despair but ashley was daring he
conquered the ice first with his car-fer-
ries of white oak and steel-covered hulls
later substituting his more elaborate steel
types and so thorough was his success
that rear-admiral makaroff of the
russian navy copied his design almost
without change for use on the baltic sea
and lake baikal-two of the most ten-

aciously ice-bound bodies of water in the
world

  with a background like this it is easy
to imagine that the men of the ice car-
ferries live in an atmosphere of con-
stant hazard and adventure curiously
enough the ice-fields both increase and
lesson the dangers faced by the ferries
of the open lake

faced starvation in ice-fields

  in the winter of x pere mar-
quette no  was disabled by the im-
pact of heavy floes off green island it
was evident that without assistance her
condition was helpless the ice-breaker
algomah was despatched to her aid but
a sudden drop in the temperature in-
creased the number and force of the
surrounding floes to such an extent that
the rescuing boat also was disabled
from early in february to the middle of
april the two vessels were as completely
marooned in the ice as any arctic ex-
ploring craft in the polar seas the pro-
visions of the crews of course were
soon exhausted for the usual trip of the
lake ferries is so short that a pretentious
larder is not carried

  it was necessary to drive live cattle
from the shore over the ice-field and
butcher them at the ships the trip over
the frozen lake was one of extreme
hazard because of treacherous air-holes
and the constantly shifting action of the
imprisoned current but it offered the
only hope of food the ice which had
caused the disaster provided the means
of salvation

  the same expedient of cattle-driving
was adopted when the ice-field off mani-
towac michigan caught the ann arbor
ferries no  and no  in the same
winter in spite of the dubiousness of
their situations however the men con-
sidered themselves lucky when the
michigan a wooden boat was marooned
in the ice of  under similar circum-
stances her months imprisonment was
followed by utter destruction as the
ice-field broke the huge churning frag-
ments literally ground her to pieces

no -meeting all manner of miscellaneous and
unassorted humanity makes the freight clerk
an expert in judging bothersome boobs

n this sad or glad old world
everything depends entirely
on how your carbureter
is working anatomical
note the carbureter is lo-
cated in  the middle right-
hand section  and is often vulgarly called
the  liver beginning again in this
sad or glad old world there are groans or
smiles just as the mixture is thin or rich
foul or right gladness or gloom is the
pit-a-pat of the motor or the squeak of an
ill-adjusted machine and the carbureter
is the first thing to look into as the source
of all our moods

  the regular fee for an expert diag-
nosis of this kind is five dollars but as
the writer does not particularly need the
money and has no license the reader may
take his time to passing it over

  seeing seemly things and having
wholesome thoughts are matters largely
of physical well-being that is what i
tried to say in the first paragraph when
i injected the  inards  of a motor car
by way of illustration

  i wanted to introduce the idea the
basic thought the fundamental theory
that wherever a man has his work and
existence and with whatever drudge
there is upon him or monotony surround-
ing him hope and pleasure exist if he
radiates these qualities himself

  this bit of reflection was brought
about by a remark made to me by a

freight-house man that  nothing of in-
terest ever occurs about a freight-house
and wherein there was naught but a
deadly routine a continuous sameness of
faces figures and facts

  i took issue with my friend in this
way

  that while every man must apply him-
self closely to some detail to live the
real pleasures he gathers are in the little
happenings the inconsequential inci-
dents the mere trifles in the passing
panorama about him and not in the en-
tertainment and blessings that he hopes
for after a bit the ability to see and
hear and appreciate the smallest things
about us makes our lives worth living
provided always lhat the aforesaid car-
bureter is working well

  it is quite true that a railroad freight-
office by reason of its direct dealing with
the public through transfer and drayage
concerns and its prosaic figures and rigid
accounting hasnt many sensations to
offer

  nevertheless among the barrels and
boxes and bundles and bills of lading
and expense bills and way-bills there
runs in and out like the thread of a
fabric the little play of human emotions
worthy their place in railroad literature

  the public thinks of a railroad only
in terms of passenger-service but the

lends is gathered in through the dingy
unornamented structure behind a row of
trap cars it is known as the freight-
house

  but with all the solidity and grind and
limitations so far as the general public
is concerned things happen about a
freight-house that bring a smile and
spice the life of those who toil day by
day behind the counter

  i wish to insist on this broad principle
in dealing with people miscellaneous
and unassorted there are as many smiles
as frowns provided as stated in the
opening paragraph the carbureter is
working well and you mr freight-
house clerk in particular there is as
much material for your pleasure in deal-
ing with the public as there is for feeding
the perennial grouch that you may un-
fortunately have

  would this annoy or amuse you 

  a serious-faced man came into our
office one day in quest of information
he wanted the rates on apples in crates
barrels bulk
car - load a n d
less than car-
load to fifteen
or twenty popu-
lous centers in
various parts of
our great do-
main

  he was par-
ticular to learn
all about our
ref rigerator-
service and the
rules relating to
car detention

he did not talk-

on a few generalities and bow him-
self out with a  thank you but
made notes minutely of all the in-
formation we detailed for him

  the apple was a new business to
us as the local demand had always ab-
sorbed the quantity raised but herein
were sudden indications that we were to
become the apple-distributing point for
the whole ohio valley

  naturally we were interested in this
prospect of revenue increase and we
questioned him a bit we learned from
him that he owned a small farm that he
had tried sheep hogs grain and other
standard products with only indifferent

success all at once the apple proposi-
tion hit him and that brought him to us
he was planning to put out a forty-acre
orchard when we dug up the rates for
him bulk and otherwise to all the marts
of trade he had not so much as put out
a single sprout

  i never knew of a longer shot for
prospective business than that for an
apple-tree requires years to become a
productive bearer when a man comes
for the freight-rates and all shipping
conditions on stuff that he cannot handle
for years to come he has a remarkable
genius for foresight or is somewhat
visionary to say the least

  the point is that no one in our office
begrudged him the time or pains of ex-
tracting the information for him it
passed a chuckle around ever since
that episode all business we scent that
does not subsequently materialize is
designated as a  rainbow  prospect
that has a delusive sound like  rain-
bow but refers particularly to the one

particular apple mentioned by our hope-
ful patron in barrels crates and bulk
before he had his first twig

 an old unkempt gent took up a
freight-bill at the counter and the de-
livery clerk with a  lively there  air
shoved over the office end of the expense
bill with the usual command

 sign there

  the old man recoiled a bit
at the prospect of signing his v
name he attempted to beg fex
off claiming the usual excuse

that he hadnt his glasses and	---

 that he couldnt write very 

well anyway	----

   got to have it interposed
the clerk

   my full name 

   yes full name responded the clerk
the old man took the proffered pencil
unlimbered his arm and back muscles
lubricated the pencil point with his
tongue and went to the task like a sculp-
tor carving letters in stone

  the clerk fumed with impatience but
there was nothing to do but stand idly
by until the requirement was fully met
the signature ran its course looping the
loop and passing the grand stand three
times until it reached the place of begin-
ning which the clerk had indicated by a
pencil mark it was translated to read
 william henry harrison gillfou-
land archibald

  all took a look at the signature and
agreed that the clerk who unnecessarily
demanded it in full got what was coming
to him we knew the name was archi-
bald but we think the old man added the
minarets and porte-cocheres to put one
over on the waiting clerk for his rather
impatient  in full

  the matter of a patrons signature re-
calls another instance where a man ap-
peared at our freight-house door with a
bag of cabbage for shipment to a near-
by town the freight-house man accept-
ing the shipment made out a bill of
lading and presented it for the shippers
signature

  now the transaction of shipping a
bag of cabbage presents no serious as-
pects no matter what may happen to it
taking into full consideration especially
that it is full flat-head dutch variety
it cannot involve one into any difficulty
beyond easy extrication

  but when the shippers signature was
requested on the shipping order he
raised a protesting hand and said  no
sir i make it a rule never to sign any
papers without knowing exactly what 
am signing

   you haft to sign the shipping or-
der  bluntly insisted the freight-house
man  everybody has to do that what
ships anything

   what does it say   demanded the
patron

   why that you are the shipper-and
that it goes to john jones sheldon 
 what else 

   thats about all

   whats all that printing on the back
and on the front of it  

   thems conditions

  what conditions

  the freight-house man gave it up in
disgust he had never read the condi-
tions under which a transportation com-
pany undertakes to receive and transport
freight he knew there was a lot of iine-
tvpe paragraphs both  the face and
observations of a country station-agent



the back of the shipping order and a bill
of lading but he had never read them
and had never known any one who had

  wheres the head man here de-
manded the cabbage exporter when he
saw the freight-house man could explain
nothing

  the freight - house man cheerfully
passes the protesting patron into the
office and over to the chief clerk

  we freight-house laborers are par-
ticularly skilled in passing anything that
is knotty or obnoxious over and along
to some one else in the office

   i want to know what i am signing
explained the patron waving the un-
signed document with a sort of question-
mark hyperbola in the general direction
of the chief clerk

   that is only a printed form bland-
ly explained the chief clerk  all the
standard uniform bills of lading have
those printed conditions all shippers
sign shipping orders without question

  well heres one that dont ex-
claimed the man with the  old-guard 
finality

   very odd replied the chief clerk
 i never heard the provisions protested
before men who make dozens of ship-
ments daily sign without a word

   when i sign anything when i put
my name to any piece of paper i am
going to know every word that stands
above it or below it or on the underside
of it aint that business now

  the chief clerk acknowledged that it
looked fair enough

   all i ask is to know what i am
signing

  this led the chief clerk to suggest that
he take the document and go out where
the light was best and go over it word
for word sentence by sentence and
paragraph by paragraph until he had full
knowledge of every hidden corporate
conspiracy that might be contained
therein as affecting the life or interests
of a plain citizen seeking to ship one bag
of cabbages	

  finally the irascible shipper asked the
chief clerk for modifications he ob-
jected particularly to waiving responsi-
bility for particular time deliver
while cabbage is neither explosive under
confinement nor likely to deteriorate in
quality within a reasonable number of
days from the period of its soundness

yet the broad general principle of the
railroad being permitted to take its time
to move the shipment did not suit him
he asked to have that clause stricken
out

  the chief clerk had to advise him that
no one in the office was empowered to
take any liberties whatever with the
printed conditions that either his signa-
true must appear thereon subscribing to
everything indicated or he could reload
the cabbage and trail back home alotnr
the r f d

  he signed under verbal protest

  note the caprices of fate the bag
was properly marked properly billed
properly loaded-but it never arrived

  the tag may have become detached
but at any rate it went astray it may
have found a dark corner in some
strange freight-house or some in-be-
tween grocer may have checked over
with his produce  one bag of cabbage
and forgot to speak up

  for many months lamentations de-
nunciations and maledictions were
heaped upon the transportation organi-
zations by the shipper

  the chief clerk advised settlement by
claim but the indignation at having as-
sented with his written signature to the
conditions one of which was to waive
time limitations on delivery seemed to
him to remove all recourse so he sat on
his haunches and howled

  how many outrages are answered in
yelping protest fury and noise instead
of a calm attempt to rectify

  we learned that once upon a time the
man who shipped the cabbage who in-
sisted on reading all the conditions and
altering those that did not suit him be-
fore appending his name - that once
upon a time an itinerant salesman sold
him a new thing in the way of a hay
hoister for which he contracted in wri-
ting

  he turned out to be a district agent
for the hoister and received a car-load
of them for all of which he was duly
bound having so nominated it in the
bond over his personal signature care-
lessly given

  he resolved never to bequeath another
signature without a look that was the
reason he was at such pains to see what
our form of shipping order might do to
him his susninnns and extraordinary

effort to play safe together with the loss
of the cabbage actually cast a rift of
sunshine in the darkness of the freight-
house office

  w e have a suspicion that the freight-
house man who in disgust turned the
shipper over to the chief clerk could
offer further testimony as to the disap-

 wire-traced and rushed he appears
to have a childs faith in the hocus-pocus
of a tracer he asks for it automatical-
ly like returning thanks and  howdy
he shipped a car-load into an adjoining
state and he sent a note to  rush it
through and put a wire-tracer after it
it chanced that we got it out without

  the car got to destination ten days
ahead of the date for which it was or-
dered before the consignee was ready
for it it accumulated ten dollars worth
of car-service which the consignee
promptly charged up to the shipper

  this brought the shipper to us to get
his money back but we had misplaced
observations of a country station-agent



the combination to the safe down deep
in the undercurrent of office feeling
there was a secret joy that the  wire-
tracer  had gotten in its work so well
you will never convince this man that a
wire-tracer is a myth

  another valued person a certain lum-
ber dealer had the habit of refusing ma-
terial that came to him on various pre-
texts he was constantly causing us
additional work in the office and particu-
lar watchfulness in handling his business

  it was the lumbermans plan of sharp
practise to turn down a consignment on
account of quality then compromise with
the shipper and finally accept it at a re-
duced figure

  there came one day a car of white-
cedar shingles which he promptly re-
jected as of inferior quality the office
made full report of the facts and the
lumber dealer coolly awaited the usual
concession in price there were letters
and telegrams between shipper and con-
signee the shipper insisted the car was
the best quality the consignee claimed
otherwise

  the dickering for advantage went on
for several days and we held the loaded
car awaiting the outcome

  one day two men in the apparent garb
of agriculture drove in to submit a bill
of lumber for the lumberman to figure
 it was a big bill and the men found
in stock what they wanted and appeared
well satisfied both with quality and price

  the bill specified a number of thou-
sand white-cedar shingles the last ar-
ticle considered the man buying the
stock did not like the shingles in the lum-
bermans stock he wanted a particular
white-cedar shingle and he was so de-
termined on that specification that it
looked as if the lumberman might lose a
big bill by not having the shingles indi-
cated

   i have it exclaimed the lumberman
with a sudden inspiration  the rail-
road has just notified me that there is a
car of white cedar just in standing 
the siding this very minute

  they went down into the yard where
the car was stored and opened the door

   you cant beat em enthusiastically
urged the lumberman  here they are
the very thing you want extra star
a star

    dont want anything else palmed

off  me said the buyer  the archi-
tect told me to look out or i would get
no  or standards star a star is
what the bill calls for

  the lumberman made the strongest
claim for the shingles but the buyer
urged all the objections against them
that the lumberman had in refusing
them such as lack of full lengths feath-
ered edges shaky and narrow

  at length the lumberman convinced
the buyer that they were exceptionally
clear clean stock in every way up to the
grade demanded

  unsuspectingly the lumberman al-
lowed himself to be led into the freight-
office unexpectedly he was adroitly led
to reiterate in the hearing of the agent
what he had urged as to the superior
quality of the product

   then you had better receive this car
from the railroad said the alleged
farmer  i havent told yoii i intended
to buy a bill of lumber i was looking
over your stock and getting prices i
may as well let you know i represent the
firm that sold you this car of shingles
since you insist they are the best that
can be turned out i dont see that there
is anything else for you to do but take
them off the railroads hands

  he did because they had him cinched
on his own testimony and approval

  of course he tried to get the railroad
to concede the accumulated car-service
but it had to stick the whole trick was
so neatly turned on him that more than
a grin went round the office it was a
full-blown roar

  there is that universal propensity
among us rogues no matter how shady
the tricks we are wont to put over our-
selves to secretly exult when a brother
rogue is outwitted every rogue is glad
to see the other rogue get his so we
all snickered when our esteemed patron
took up his freight-bill with the car-
service bill up to the last minute attached
thereto

  now and then even the dead things
about the freight-house come in combi-
nations that startle and amuse

  an ambitious young physician rented
an office in our town and ordered a com-
plete outfit of chairs cabinets tables
cases etc the shipment came in and
was set out in a way-car on our team-
track the car contained a number of


railroad mans magazine

shipments for our station which our
check-clerk found to consist of

    the young doctors office outfit

    a consignment of fresh flowers for a
  flower man

    a shipment of burial caskets for an un-
  dertaking establishment

   some granite monuments for a tomb-
  stone dealer

    nothing else

  did any freight-house man ever open
a way-car  a neater combination the
doctor the flowers the casket the monu-
ment hard to beat that line of creden-
tials and recommendations for a young
physician just starting

  freight-house men and local freight-
crews often find pleasure in the mere
handling of freight for example load-
ing or unloading flour is uproarious sport

  the game is to form a line and the
sacks are pitched from one to another
commencing in the car and ending in the
freight-house or vice versa

  it is great play the game is to crowd
some weaker link faster than he can
handle the sacks so that he drops one
occasionally if he is adjusted for a
twenty-five-pound sack to unexpectedly
deliver to him one weighing fifty pounds
this knocks him off his underpinnings
twists his spine wallops his diaphragm
around the transverse colon and he
drops the sack

  the extent of the hilarity depends 
how many sacks he drops bursts and
musses up of course the company in
the end settles with the consignee for his
loss but what has that to do with real
live pastime

  why if two or more boxes barrels
or packages are shipped and one of them
is lost it invariably contains the high
quality stuff it is the most valuable of
them all the cheaper articles always
get through the package containing
the silver silk or the cut glass is the one
that evaporates if a patron  checks
short  one piece of the lot depend upon
it that piece contains the expensive ma-
terials of the whole invoice it does not
just happen that way it is the work of
the railroad jinx

  every railroad freight-house has a
shipper who brings a barrel of apples
in the fall a dressed hog in the winter
and a bag of seed corn in the spring
whereupon he calls attention to the great

business he is doing with the railroad
and puffs up as a prized and valued
patron

  more and more the cry of rush and
the demand for special movement assails
the ear of the freight-house man every-
where private families are purchasing at
department concerns and the inquiries
and complications of these new transac-
tions are unloaded on the freight-office

  the baby the boy the miss the father
the mother grandma and grandpa tele-
phone in turn from early morn to dewy
eve every time diere is a whistle of a
passing engine some member rings up
the freight-house to know if the box that
was shipped out of buffalo  day before
yesterday hasnt come in  

   day before yesterday  in buffalo
means to-day in ohio missouri or
south dakota distance and transfer
terminals are no object every one is
hurried and worried and with a vague
idea that the legerdemain of freight
transportation should carry a shipment
anywhere in two days

  a german unloaded a box into our
freight-house and wiped his brow

  hes deat said he solemnly to the
freight-house man

   dead  echoed the clerk

   yah  hes deat we send him to
iowa

   we cant handle a corpse in that
way exclaimed the freight-house man
aghast

   dot aint him exclaimed the ger-
man  haw haw  thats a goot
joke on you this is his clothes und
books und things we send to his boy
at marshalltown

   oh i see a box of effects

   you get him out by yesterday
huh  

   yes its gone to-morrow

   huh veil he get it to-day maybe
you put a tracer after him 

   better consult the clergy about that
 i hear if you put a tracer after him
it rush him through

  it takes more imagination than our
freight-house man possessed to under-
stand why a tracer should pursue a dead
mans belongings he dully reasoned it
out that as the son had gone through all
the years without the trappings in ques-
tion the matter of a few days in de-
livery was of  particular concern

  the german had the idea of a tracer
just because  everybodys doin it 

  we received one day a sewing-ma-
chine for susan blinker crated in rough
boards with the superstructure wrapped
in rag-carpet it wasnt a  factory to
buyer  machine but an old family
treasure that aunt was sending from
herkimer county when it arrived a

  well  

  you will have to file your claim

  cant you see that its broke aint
 that file enough 

  but you must make a bill against us
 pin your expense bill and the original
 bill-lading to it-

  you dont need anything susan
 broke in abruptly  its broke you

leg was broken the way-bill bore the
notation  found broken at buffalo
transfer ditto at columbus

  it had been crated by one inexperi-
enced and had play enough inside to
break its shins ribs or cranium in the
jerk and jar of box car transportation

  susan was notified she appeared at
our counter in person she gasped in
horror on finding that a leg of the ma-
chine was broken then she stiffened and
said sternly

   what are you going to do about it 
vve explained that she should accept
the machine with expense bill noted  leg
broken and then file with us a claim
for cost of a new casting together with
the expense of putting it on

  people cannot well understand the
general circumlocution of claim papers
and the delays incident thereto there
is a general impression that an agent can
produce the wherewithal on the spot and
liquidate without the trifling preliminary
of having the claim office investigate

   it will cost five dollars to get a new
casting snapped susan

   very likely we acquiesced in our
suavest manner

  its broke and
 you broke it
 pay for it right
 now snapped
 susan

know its broke you acknowledge its
broke and you broke it i want pay
for it right now  

  again we explained that it was im-
possible for us to pay on the spur of the
moment and again indicated to her the
best course for her to pursue

   then ill leave the machine on your
hands  hotly retorted susan

  there is a crude impression abroad
that when you leave it  on the railroads
bands  you have played the master
stroke hurled the king-bolt cast the die
nr whatever it is that indicates that you
have put across something vital

  susan swished out and an awkward
young man came in

   the sewing-machine said he ten-
tatively  how long will it take to get
the pay for it if she puts in a claim 

  we made a guess  thirty sixty or
ninety days

  me backed out and joined susan at the
buggy they had driven in together
after a conference he returned

   aint there any way it could be paid
sooner   he asked

  we assured him there was not

  he went out and argued with the
woman she shook her head then her
fist at the freight-office

  the young man once more returned
and stuck his head in the door

   she says shes goin to leave it on
your hands until you pay for it  he
called out and they drove away

  we trucked the crippled sewing-ma-
chine into the corner of the freight-house
consecrated to the infirm the homeless
and the derelict and made the usual
 damage and refused  reports

  at the end of a week susan reap-
peared to know if we now had enough
and were ready to hand over

  the same awkward young man was
with her he thought she should do as
we said and take the machine out and
settle afterward but to susans mind
the short cut to justice was to  leave it
on our hands  until we yelled enough

  at regular and repeated intervals the
woman appeared to learn the effect of
her drastic action in  leaving it on our
hands

  she thought the strain would soon tell
on us each time the awkward young
man was with her he appeared less
triumphant and more concerned each
time he argued with the woman and tried
to hit on some plan for getting the ma-
chine out but she was the most obdu-
rate claimant our office had ever en-
countered

  there was a deadlock it looked like
night sessions and into the summer
nothing could move the woman from
her purpose the machine was on our
hands

  the awkward young man was troub-
led he tried in every way but he could
not conciliate the factions encumbered
and oppressed as we were with the ma-
chine  on our hands we still insisted

on observing certain rules this strained
relationship and high tension went 
for two months when one day the wom-
an appeared in a rather jubilant and ex-
ultant mood and took the machine away

  we did not question her although we
were at a loss to know why she changed
her mind so suddenly and with such an
air of triumph in time it came out

  the awkward young man was to wed
the daughter of the woman the date
was fixed an old auntie forwarded a
sewing-machine so all the brides wed-
ding garments could be made at home

  then the railroad broke the machine
and preparations came to a halt pending
adjustment of damages the situation
resolved itself into- machine no sly-
ly made wedding garments  wedding

  the awkward young man got very
anxious and the prospective mother-in-
laws rigid idea of right threatened de-
lay she held steadfast on the matter
of principle and as our office could do
nothing further it began to look to the
young man as if possession of the fair
juliet would have to go over until after
harvest

  in desperation he told our freight-
house man of his dilemma

   i wouldnt have had this happen for
fifty dollars he gulped

  you wouldnt asked the freight-
house man sympathetically

   not for a hundred no not for the
best horse i got on the place 

   ill tell you old top said the
freight-liouse man with a flow of fellow
feeling  why dont you settle it and get
the wheels to turning 

   i cant she wont let me shes
the stubbornest woman-

  slip me five dollars said the freight-
house man  i can fix her bring her
in and ill settle with her she will never
know but that the railroad is paying it

  the awkward young man was de-
lighted with this simple plan he passed
over the five went directly for susan
blinker who returned with him and the
machine was taken off our hands

  at the appointed time - somewhere
between laying away the corn and plow-
ing for winter wheat - the awkward
young man married the girl  hile in
the silence of the country no wedding-

  the performance of the working model

dimensions and performances with some
of the late celebrated english locomotives

hibition at liverpool in october last for

the  purse anil many other interest-
ing experiments by the novelty and
rocket since that time as mr coopers
engine has been got up in a temporary
manner and for experiment only and has
been  the road but a few days it will
be  more than justice to make the com-
parison with some of the early experiments
of the english engines i have therefore
selected the experiment of the rocket in
october  the result of which the premi-
um of  was awarded to mr stephen-
son its builder for having produced the
most efficient locoinotive-engine etc

  the rocket is professedly an eight-
horse-power when working at a moderate
speed but when working at high veloci-
ties she is said to be more than eight
horse-power its furnace is two feet wide
by three feet high  the boiler is six feet
long and three feet in diameter

  the furnace is outside of the main
boiler and has an external casing between
which and the fireplace there is a space of
three inches filled with water and com-
municating with the boiler tin- heated
air from the furnacc is circulated through
the boiler by means of twenty-live pipes of
two inches internal diameter it has two
working cylinders of eight inches internal
diameter and fifteen inches in length each
or thereabouts the road-wheels to which
the motion is communicated are four feet
eight and a half inches in diameter

  mr coopers engine has hut one work-
ing cylinder of three and one-fourth inches
diameter and fourteen and a half inch
stroke of piston with a boiler proportion-
ally small or nearly so the wheels of
the engine to which the motion is com-
municated arc two and a half feet in
diameter making it necessary to gear
with wheel and pinion to get speed by
which means a considerable consumption
of power is experienced

  you will perceive by the foregoing that
the capacity or number of cubic inches
contained in the cylinder of mr coopers
engine is only about one-fourteenth part
of that contained in the two cylinders of
the rocket consequently it can only use
one-fourteenth the quantity of steam under
the same pressure when each engine is ma-
king the same number of strokes per min-
ute which is nearly the case when the two
engines arc going at equal speed  the
road

  the total weight moved in the experi-
ment above alluded to by the rocket in-
cluding her own weight was seventeen
tons  the level road at an average speed
of twelve and a half miles the hour there-
by exhibiting agreeably to vignoless late
table of the power of locomotive-engines
a little jess than a six-horse engine

  mr coopers engine has to-day moved
a gross weight of four and a half tons
from the depot to ellicotts mills and back
in the space of two hours and t- minutes
which as you are aware the disance be-
ing twenty-six miles gives an average
speed of twelve miles to the hour as the

engine returned with its load to the same
point whence it started the acclivities and
declivities of the road were of course
balanced and at least as much time and
power if not more were required to
traverse the whole distance as would have
been on a level road therefore mr
coopers engine exhibited an average
force during the time it was running f
 horse-power or nearly one and a half
which is more than three times as much
power as the rocket exhibited during the
experiment above described in proportion
to the cylindrical capacity of the respective
engines

  this no doubt originated in a consider-
able degree from the steam being used in
mr coopers engine at a higher pressure
than in the rocket we arc however not
able to come to any very correct conclu-
sion as to what extent this cause prevailed
mr coopers steam-gage not being ac-
curately weighed which prevents a more
minute comparison being made

  it may be said that subsequent practise
and experience with the rocket have en-
abled her constructor to produce more
favorable results which is  doubt the
case but we have every reason to expect
a similar effect with regard to mr
coopers engine judging from what we
have witnessed each exhibition of its
power being as yet an improvement upon
the one that preceded it

  it is however too small and too tempo-
rary in its construction to expect a great
deal from the friction of the parts the
heat lost in a small engine being much
greater in proportion to the power than in
a large one but to-days experiments
must i think establish beyond a doubt
the practicability of using locomotive
steam-power on the baltimore and ohio
railroad for the conveyance of passengers
and goods at such speed and with such
safety when compared with other
inodes as will be perfectly satisfactory
to all parties concerned and with such
economy as must be highly flattering to
the interests of the company

  it has been doubted by many whether
the unavoidable numerous short curves
and inclined planes  the line of your
road would not render the use of locomo-
tive power impracticable but the velocity
with which we have been propelled to-day
by steam-power round some of the shortest
curves-from fifteen to eighteen miles per
hour-without the slightest appearance of
danger and with very little if any in-
creased resistance as there was no ap-
preciable falling off in the rate of speed
and the slight diminution in speed in pass-
ing up the inclined planes some of which
were nearly twenty feet to the mile must
i think put an end to such doubts and at
once show the capability of the baltimore
and ohio railroad to do much more than
was at first anticipated or promised by its
projectors and supporters

  an interesting description of the first

written at the time by h b latrobe

road said

    for a brief season it was believed that
  this feature of the early american roads
  would prevent the use of loeomotive-en-
  gines the contrary was demonstrated by
  a gentleman still living in an active and

might be adapted to the curved roads
which he saw would be built in the united
states and he came to baltimore which
then possessed the only one on which he
could experiment to vindicate his belief

themselves from place to place and as the
speaker now recalls its appearance the
only wonder is that so apparently insig-
nificant a contrivance could ever have been
regarded as competent to the smallest
results

  but mr cooper was wiser than many of
the wisest around him his engine could
not have weighed a ton but he saw in it
a principle which the forty-ton engines of
to-day have but served to develop an 
demonstrate

  the boiler of m r coopers engine was
not as large as the kitchen boiler attached
to many a range in modern mansions it
was of about the same diameter but not
much more than half as high it stood
upright in the car and was filled above
the furnace which occupied the lower sec-
tion with vertical tabes

  the cylinder was but three and a half
inches in diameter and speed was sarted
up by gearing	

  no natural draft could have been suili-
cient to keep up steam in so small a boiler
and mr cooper used therefore a blow-
iug-apparatus driven by a drum attached
to one of the ear-wheels over which
passed a cord that in its turn worked a
pulley on the shaft of the blower

  among the first buildings erected at
mount clare was a large car-house in
which railroad tracks were laid at right
angles with the nad-track communicating
with the latter by a turntable a lilliputian
affair indeed compared with the revolving
platforms its successors now in use

  in ts cir-shop mr cooper had his
engine  lore scni was first raised
and it	s s toii it wcr within the

last week that te st-ler saw george
brown the treasurer of the company one
of our most estimable citizens his father
alexander brown phillip k thomas ani
one or two more watch mr cooper as
with his own hands he opened the throttle
admitted the steam into the cylinder and
saw the crank-substitute operate success-
fully with a clacking noise while the ma-
chine moved slowly forward with some of
the bystanders who had stepped upon it

  and this was the first locomotive for
railroad purposes ever built in america
and this was the first transportation of
persons by steam that had ever taken
place on this side of the atlantic on an
american-built locomotive

  mr coopers success was such as in in-
duce him to try a trip to ellicotts mills
on which occasion an open car the first
used upon the road already mentioned
having been attached to the engine and
filled with the directors and some friends
the speaker among the rest the first
journey by sieani in   erica on an ameri-
can locomotive was commenced the trip
was most interesting

  the curves were passed without diffi-
culty at a speed of fifteen miles an hour
the grades were ascended with compara-
tive ease the day was fine the company
in the highest spirits and some excited

gentlemen of the party pulled out memo-
randum-books and when at the highest
speed which was eighteen miles an hour
wrote their names and some connected
sentences to prove that even at that great
velocity it was possible to do so

  i he return trip from the mills a dis-
tance of thirteen miles was made in fifty-
seven minutes this was in the summer of
i  but the triumph of this tom thumb
engine was not altogether a drawback
the great stage proprietors of the day
were stockton and stokes and on that
occasion a gallant gray of great beauty
and power was driven by the u from towii
attached to another cr on the second
track-for the company had begun by ma-
king two tracks to the mills-and n-vt the
engine at the relay house on its way
back

  from this point it was determined to
have a race home and the start being
even away went horse and engine the
snort of the one and the puff of the other
keeping time and time

  at first the gray had the best of it for
his steam would be applied to the greitest
advantage oil the illsant while the engine
had to wait until te relation of the
wheels set the blowers t work the horse
was perhaps a quarter of a mile a ead
when the safety-valve of t e engine lifted
and the thin blue vapor issuing from it
showed an excess of seim

  the blower whistled the steam blew
off in vapory clouds the pace increased
the passengers shoute  t e engine gained
on the horse

  soon it lapped him the siik was placed
the race was neck au n k-n se and
nose then the engine passei the horse
and a great hurrah hailed lie victory

  but it was not repeated for just at this
time when the gray master was about
giving up the band which drove the pulley
and moved the blower slipped from the
drum the safety-valve ceased l s-ream
and the engine for want ofbreath began
to wheeze and pant

  in vain mr cooper who was his own
engineer and fireman lacerated his bauds
in attempting to replace the band upon the
wheel in vain he tried to urge the lire
with light wood the horse gained on the
machine and passed it and although the
band was presently replaced the steam
again did its best the horse was too far
ahead to be overtaken and came in the
winner of the race

  but the real victory was with mr
cooper notwithstanding he had held fast
to the faith that was in him and had dem-
onstrated its truth beyond peradventure

  in a patent case tried many years after-
ward the boiler of mr coopers engine
became important as a piece of evidence
it was hunted for and found among some
old rubbish at mount clare li was diffi-
cult to imagine that it had ever venerated
steam enough to drive a coffee-mill much
less to run an engine that could go as fast
as a horse
the romance of american railroads



the oldest locomotive in the world that is daily under steam it was built in j
and to-day is making regular trips at the collieries oh sir lindsay wood
hetton-le-hole durham county england

  in those days of railroad romance
when the crude early locomotives were
looked upon as mere freaks and impos-
sible of practical development steam
had one great rival to overcome and
that was  horse  power

  a horse was placed in a car and made
to walk on an endless apron or belt in
order to  make the wheels go round

  the machine worked indifferently
but on one occasion when drawing a
car filled with representatives of the
press it ran into a cow and the pas-
sengers having been tilted out and rolled
down an embankment were unanimous
in condemning the contrivance and so
the  horse  power car passed out of
existence

  next came the meteor a sailing
vehicle it was the invention of evan
thomas who was perhaps the first man
who advocated railroads in baltimore

  the meteor required a good gale to
drive it and would only run when the
wind was abaft or on the quarter mead
winds were fatal lo it and mr thomas
was afraid to trust a strong side wind
lest the meteor might upset

  therefore it seldom made its appear-
ance unless the wind was from the north

when it would be dragged out lo the
farther end of the old mount clair
embankment and be blown back

  the baltimore and  hio railroad be-
ing the tirst in operation in thiscountry
and almost the first in the world for the
transportation of passengers and mer-
chandise was visited by people from all
over the world among them was baron
krudener envoy from russia who by
invitation of mr thomas made an ex-
cursion in the sailing-car and  sailed 
it himself < >n his return from the trip
he declared he had never before traveled
so pleasantly

  mr thomas had a model of the sail-
ing-car constructed which he presented
to baron krudener with the compli-
ments of the company to be forwarded
to the emperor like the horse-car the
sailing-car was soon sent to the scrap-
heap it was an amusing toy only

  it was after the demonstration by
peter cooper that the baltimore and
susquehanna railroad company im-
ported the herald from england

  its greatest stunt was to run off the
track r ts unfitness with its large
wheels for use  our curved roads
was quickly apparent


railroad mans magazine

  despite its unpractical qualities the
 lerald was greatly admired for its
beauty thomas john its  driver
was also much in tbe public eye when
be came down from his  lofty  perch
to oil the engine the crowd surrounded
him

  peter cooper like his eminent con-
temporary george stephenson may b
looked upon justly as the pioneer of the
locomotive system in america un-
doubtedly he built the first locomotive
ever constructed here and although hi
little machine was not intended for prac-
tical purposes on a railroad yet it estab-
lished a fact then very much doubted
the ability of a locomotive to travel 
curves

  but the heraid was antedated in an-
other quarter mr cooper commenced
his career in life from the very foot of
the ladder ami by his indomitable per-
severance and industry rose step by step
until he reached the top llis life-story
is the history of a poor hoy without edu-
cation or influential friends who raised
himself to a position of wealth and
reputation

  mr cooper was born in the city of
new york february   his
maternal grandfather john campbell
was mayor of new york and deputy
quartermaster-general during the rev-
olutionary w ar in which his father also
served as a lieutenant

  mr coopers father was a hatter and
as soon as young peter was old enough
to pick fur from the rabbit skins used in
making hats lie was set to work

  he had  opportunities for educa-
tion and only attended school one or
two months in his life

    have never had any time to gt an
education he once almost pathetically
remarked  and all that i know i have
had to pick it  as  went along

  lie remained in the hat business with
his father until he hail mastered all its
branches during much of the time
after he had finished his labors for the
day he would work until late at night
with some carvers tools which his grand-
mother gave him in order to add to his
small wages

  the cooper institute in new york
city is the result of his recollections of
those early days of struggle and is in-
tended to help poor boys

   oung cooper afterward went into
the brewing business at which he re-
mained for two years lie then served
an apprenticeship at coach-making and
finally joined his brother in the cloth-
shearing business

  for some time they succeeded but
after the war of the business was
so injured by the introduction of foreign
cloths that peter cooper left it and be-
gan cabinet-making

  he gave this up after a while and
opened a groeery-store on the present
site of the cooper union new york
city where be carried on a small retail
trade he bought a woolen factory with
his savings

  lie was interested ii other ventures
but the largest part of his fortune was
made in the manufacture of glue and
by his iron-works

  in  he erected extensive iron-
works at canton near baltimore where
he built from his own designs the first
locomotive  this continent

  he carried on large wire and rolling
mills at trenton new jersey and was
the first man to roll wrought-iron beams
for fireproof buildings lie was inter-
ested in the progress of telegraphy and
was an officer in several leading tele-
graph associations

  while serving as an alderman mr
cooper conceived the idea of  cooper
union a fellow alderman who had
visited the ecoles dindustrie in paris
and been much impressed with their
utility and attractions described them to
mr cooper and suggested that a similar
school should be started in this country
the idea remained for many years in
mr coopers mind finally the ground
was broken and the educational monu-
ment to peter cooper begun

  the mere saving and donating of the
money for the purpose was but a frac-
tion of the work performed great diffi-
culties had to be overcome in designing
the building unique at the time but
very old-fashioned when compared with
the wonderful buildings of to-day

  mr cooper was determined that ii
should be fireproof consequently a sep-
arate foundry had to be erected to forge
the iron used in the construction  hen
this was done the estimated outlay fell
short twenty-five thousand dollars of the
actual cost
the romance of american railroads



  countless other obstacles hail to be
overcome and finally ilie institute was
completed at cost far in advance of its
estimated expense in fact it took all
mr coopers money to finish it and he
was a comparatively poor man when all
the bills were paid

  on the day the building was com-

pleted february i-j  mr cooper
reached his eightieth birthday

  the key to mr coopers life is to be
found in his own words i resolved
that  would repay every benefit which
i had received by conferring an equal
benefit on some of my fellow men

 the conditions required and the
premium offered by the baltimore and
hio railroad company for the best
locomotive of american manufacture
were as follows

raiikoaii company

                           january  

    the baltimore and ohio railroad com-
  pany being desirous of obtaining a supply

  facture adapted to their road the presi-
  dent and directors hereby gie public
  notice that they will pay the sum of four
  thousand dollars for the most approved
  engine which shall be delivered for trial
  upon the road on or before the st of
  june  and they will also pay three
  thousand live hundred dollars for the en-
  gine which shallbe adjudged the next best

and lie delivered as aforesaid subject to
ilie following conditions to wit

  first-the engine must burn coke or
coal and must consume its own smoke

  second-the engine when in operation
must not exceed three and one-half tons
weight and must on a level road be
capable of drawing day by day fifteen
tons inclusive of the weight of the

feet but if the connection be such as to
work with the adhesion of two wheels
only then those two wheels may have a
diameter not exceeding four feet and the

  fhineas daviss engine
better known as davis and gartner s en-
gine built at york pennsylvania was
the only one which came up to the re-
quirements of the company after a trial
and several modifications and changes
late in the summer of  this engine
was found capable of running between
baltimore and ellicotts mills thirteen
miles it hauled four loaded cars of the
gross weight of fourteen tons and made
the thirteen miles in about one hour

  this engine was mounted  wheels
thirty inches in diameter and its velocity
was effected by means of gearing with
a spur-wheel and pinion on one of the
axles of the  road wheels

  in the construction of the road from
baltimore to the point of rocks every-
thing suggested by science or experience
was tested therefore this road had the
honor of solving most of the problems
which presented themselves in this early

  i he charleston courier of december
 published the following letter from
columbia where tbe legislature was in
session at the time

 the committee to whom the charleston
memorial was referred is divided in
opinion on the propriety of an appropria-
tion for the survey of the country between

 charleston and hamburg some of the
 committee think that if the railroad is to
 be the work of a company who is to re-
 ceive all the profits the whole expense
 should be borne by the company and
 again that if a survey be effected by the
 state it would not be done so satisfactori-
 ly to the community as it probably would
 be ii managed by individuals immediately
 interested

the south carolina railroad was passed

recommending the kind of road to be
constructed and the best power to be
used

  having visited england to examine
the progress made in railroads and loco-
motives and having been requested
while in england by john r jervis
chief engineer of the delaware and hud-
son railroad to contract for the iron
for that road and procure for it three
first-class locomotives the charleston
railroad directors had confidence in his
skill and judgment

  in his report at this first meeting mr
allen used all the arguments at his com-
mand to recommend the construction of
the road for steam power he was so
successful that at the meeting on jan-
uary   when the report was
acted upon thomas bennett offered a
resolution to the effect that  the steam
alone should be used upon the road and
the selection of the locomotive would

render the application of animal power
a great abuse of the gifts of genius and
science

  at the same period that is prior to
the great locomotive trial in england
and when the baltimore and ohio rail-
road company were so strongly im-
pressed in favor of horse-power it be-
came necessary for horatio allen as
engineer of the south carolina railroad
company to decide for what power that
road should be built

  the road was one hundred and thirty-
six miles long from the character of
the country the plan of the road would
be naturally influenced by the kind of
power adopted stationary power was
out of the question but the opinion was
held by many of great intelligence that
horse-power should be tried

  in the report mr allen made on this
important question he submitted a com-
parative estimate of the results of
horse- power and locomotive power
that estimate was in favor of locomotive
power but he rested the decision on the
basis that what the performance of a
horse was and would be every one
knew but the man was not living who
would undertake to say what the locomo-
tive was yet to do

  in the recommendation of this report
in favor of locomotive power the board
of the south carolina railroad company

unanimously concurred and as this de-
cision was the first on any railway built

was awarded to c e detmole who in-

    a sail was set on a car on our railroad
  yesterday afternoon in the presence of a
  large concourse of spectators fifteen
  gentlemen got on board and flew off at
  the rate of twelve to fourteen miles an
  hour thirteen persons and three toils
  of iron were carried about ten miles an
  hour the preparations for sailing were
  very hastily got up and of course were
  not of the best kind but owing t this
  circumstance the experiment afforded high
  sport

   the wind blew very fresh from about

  northeast which as a sailor would say
  was abeam and would drive the car
  either way with equal speed when going
  at the rate of about twelve miles an hour
  and loaded with fifteen passengers the
  mast went by the board with t e sail and
  rigging attached carrying with them sev-
  eral of the crew the wreck was descrie i
  by several friendly shipmasters who kind-
  ly rendered assistance in rigging a jury-
  mast and the car was again soon put
  under way

   during the afternoon the wind changed
 so as to bring ii nearly ahead when going
 in one direction but this did not stop the
 sport as it ascertained that the car would
 sail within four points of the wind we
 understand it is intended l y some of our

the festiniog railroad a railroad not
much larger than that which a king
might have constructed to amuse the
children of the royal household has taken
its place among the most successful lines in
wales in operation for over seventy
years it is distinctly profitable and pays
satisfactory dividends the festiniog is
one of the toy railroads of the world for
it is equipped with mere miniatures of the
great rolling stock of our modern systems

  the festiniog railroad is the first of its
kind ever constructed it was built in 
to facilitate the transportation of slate from
the welsh quarries to portmadoc it was
operated by gravitation and horses the
long inclines would carry the cars to their
destination while horses would haul back
the empties

  in  after twenty-three years of serv-
ice for the quarries c e spooner an en-
gineer suggested that the steam-engine be
introduced and the railroad reconstructed
to carry passengers and freight the sug-
gestion was adopted and in that year its
period of business and finance began

  the festiniog railroad is thirteen and
one-half miles long its gage is 
inches from terminus to terminus it as-
cends or descends the inclines along which
the old gravitation equipment once rolled
on the journey northward the difference
in the altitude of the two terminals is 
feet which means a constant climb front
portmadoc the grades are various in
their severity the curves arc many and
sharp in many places a train of the usual
number of cars winds around two or three
curves within its own length

  its first locomotive was called the lit-
tle wonder and it has won its title for
after almost thirty-five years  the rails
it is still in efficient service it was built in
 its cylinders arc v inches in diame-
ter with a stroke of  inches the dri-
vers are  inches in diameter its height
is about that of the average man

  notwithstanding its size it can haul a
train of  passenger-cars  box-cars a
caboose and  or more empty slate-
trucks-a string measuring more than 

feet in length and weighing  tons it
makes the grades without difficulty and
 the more favorable stretches it can at-
tain a speed of  miles an hour

  the railroad possesses several features
of technical interest for being a one-track
road it is equipped with passing-sidings
spurs and the necessary telegraphic and
signal equipment to render the operation
of the road perfectly safe there is little
or no danger to passengers in fact it is not
known that a collision or derailment has
ever occurred

might bump their heads

  the engineer and fireman face what is
practically the only danger  the road-
the tunnels when the tunnels were built
little or  clearance was allowed above the
tops of the cars for the possibility of the
steam-engine and its crew was not then
considered when standing  the deck
the heads of the fireman and engineer ex-
tend above the entrances of the tunnels
and serious accidents might result if they
failed to lower their heads when running
into one of the passageways

  though the passenger-cars are small
they furnish comfortable accommodation
for fifty passengers

  i  over  tourists rode  the
festiniog

  the success of the festiniog encouraged
others to construct miniature narrow-gage
railroads in north wales the north
 ales narrow-gage railroad is being oper-
ated but the most famous of the worlds
 toy  railroads is the otavi line in south
africa it is the longest little railroad in
the world extending  miles from swap-
komund on the coast of german south-
west africa to tsumeb in the heart of the
wilderness its gage is two feet

  in  a party of construction engineers
sailed for africa with the first cargo of
material the question of securing labor
was a most distracting one strikes oc-
curred the europeans found much diffi-
culty in commingling with the natives but
eventually in  the road was finished

          c augustus jeffries born ninety years ago and still
          hale and hearty tells of the high spots of his
          interesting life as a pennsy engineer of the fifties

b y h  m   o  e 

ilnce the day  began rail-
roading in  theres been
 mighty changes in equipment
and methods but it seems to
me that the boys havent
changed a bit i spose this
is owing to the railroad business calling
for men who have sound brains and
bodies grit and get-there and a liking
for wheels and grease

   the consequence is that while the
lay-out of the railroads may be much
different from what they used to be the
make-up of the boys is about the same
all the way through

  the speaker was charles augustus
jeffries or as he prefers to be called
c augustus jeffries as he has a son
who bears his full name not only is
mr jeffries the oldest pensioner of the
pennsylvania railroad but according
to his statement which is confirmed by
the company the oldest american rail-
road engineer now living born  ctober
 he became a fireman  the state-
owned columbia and philadelphia rail-
road in  three years later he was
promoted to the post of engineer when
the pennsy acquired the columbia and
philadelphia it took over mr jeffries
lie continued as an engineer until 
when he was made signal-repairer i
 he was put  tlie pension list

  mr jeffries lives in the town of bis
birth lancaster pennsylvania in a
quiet homelike cozy residence the ven-
erable engineer and his sister keep
house miss jeffries is a pleasant-man-
nered lady who like her brother has

youth in her heart though the years
have silvered her hair

  the nonagenarian engineer is rather
small of stature has a finely shaped
head covered with a thick growth of
snow-white hair and it is easy to see
that in his younger days he must have
had bis full share of bodily strength he
stands as straight as a rake-handle and
aside from a slight deafness he is in full
possession of all his faculties

  in conversation he shows no signs of
his great age but keeps the talk-ball
rolling without cessation lie enjoys a
joke and readily gives a humorous turn
to a discussion when an opportunity
occurs

  when asked if he felt the weight of
bis ninety years mr jeffries replied by
giving a series of calisthenic stunts of a
more or less strenuous nature ending the
performance with a startling climax of
high kicking during which his toe-lip
was on a level with his nose

  hows that for a kid on ninety
be asked triumphantly and his eyes
twinkled with laughter  dont look as
if the grasshopper was a burden as the
good book says what no sir i
know im not a young chap any longer
but i sometimes feel as if i werent a
day over thirty

became fireman to belter himself

   what got me going as fireman 
well twas like this my father was a
mechanic in a local shop and ii was in-
tended that i was to follow his trade
oldest lin ing hogcer

ill

 did put in some years at it but like
most boys i wanted to see the world and
get better pay than  was earning

   the railroad seemed to offer both
so i jumped aboard the first tallow-pot
job that was offered me the pay
well it wasnt so much in those days

but it was better than being confined to
a shop

   firemen in those days were paid one
dollar and twenty-five cents a day and
engineers two dollars some years
later the state legislature passed a law
that the engineers should get two dollars
and fifty cents and we thought it quite
generous in those days there was no
brotherhood

   we earned all that came to us
looking back it seem to me that we took

our lives- in our hands every time we
started out on a run there were no
block signals no interlocking systems
we worked mostly by rule of thumb
and the keeping of the schedules depend-
ed on the weather and what happened at
the depots where we stopped

   n foggy days we crawled and on
foggy nights we just barely kept her
moving-no more fenced-in track so
far as the columbia and philadelphia
railroad was concerned was unknown
and cattle made the track a loafing-place
night and day especially when the
weather was thick id hate to say just
how many tons of beef  made in those
days

   and the engines we had ha ha
ha made right here in lancaster most

of em were although some came from
philadelphia the engine i first went
firing on might have weighed four tons
she had two drivers a truck of four
wheels and a tender in which we carried
wood and water

   coal was used as fuel on only a few
engines the engines were built without
cabs and when we came to a low bridge
we had to use a long iron rod that ended
in a hook to buckle up the smoke-stack
which worked on hinges there was a
good deal of such hooking on my run
and in foggy weather or on dark nights
we were continually bumping into
bridges that wed come to before we
knew where we were

    never got hit myself but when i
became an engineer two or three of my
firemen got pretty bad cracks on their
thought-domes in this way

   and those cabless machines were
cold in winter manys the time that 
reached the end of the run with my face
so purple with cold that  looked as if i
was wearing a mask frost-bitten
yes sir on many trips-and my eyelids
were so puffed  could hardly see

roasted and froze at same i ime

   worst of it was we were roasting
from the knees down while we were
freezing from the chest up there was
very little space between the fire-box and
the rear of the engine so we got all that
was coming to us from the heat as well
as the cold it seems that we used to get
harder winters than nowadays and  tell
you that the westward run through a
heavy snowfall with the wind in ones
face was no joke in those cabless en-
gines

  mr jeffries asked his sister to fetch a
daguerreotype of the first engine that he
ran it was a tiny machine with just
enough room for the driver to stand back
of the fire-box while in comparison the
tender was very large because of the
huge supply of wood that il had to carry
the photographer had put a graphic
touch on the negative by making it ap-
pear that the machine was  popping 
furiously

   built in lancaster and could make
her twenty-five or thirty miles per when
put to it said mr jeffries proudly
 no she hasnt any cab  know but

whether she froze us or put us in danger
of sunstroke she was a beauty just the
same the old engineer looked fondly
at the picture

   now ill show you the picture of the
real locomotive that  drove for - oh
more years than i can remember come
along

  me led the way into the sitting-room
on one of the walls of which was a large
picture of the john c breckenbridge
done in water-colors to one accus-
tomed to the huge engines of to-day it
looked spidery and dwarflike but to the
veteran engineer it was evident that it
was still the combination of speed and
strength as he knew it mr jeffries
sighed in prideful contentment as be
eyed the picture

his engine a rainbow of color

   there she is he said just as she
looked the day she came from the shops
and  was made her captain tother one
was all right but this put it all over the
little one she was a glittering beauty
when she got in the sunlight she fairly
twinkled her smoke-stack-dye note
the shape of it  like a megaphone
turned upside down it was polished
brass so were her forward and rear
steam-domes and her whistle bell and
sand-box

   see that perky eagle cocked on the
sand-box her boiler cylinders and
steam-chest were cased in polished brass
it took a mightly lot of elbow-grease to
keep her in trim but we didnt mind for
we took a pride in making  john  shine
like a star

  john c breckenbridge has a cab
you see went on mr jeffries after a
pause  also two trucks with four wheels
 each and four drivers yes the pilot
does seem a trifle skinny but it did the
work and we didnt spare any paint
the drivers as well as the truck-wheels
were bright red and green to match the -
tender which certainly was a handsome
thing

   steam i should say she could
shed make thirty-five without loosening
a nut and shed answer the levers like
a tender-mouthed horse weight 
should sav about ten tons

    most forgot to say that the tenders
of those times were all built on the same
oldest living hocger



plan there was a water-tank in the
center and the space around was packed
with wood or wood and coal as the case
might be we burned hard wood and
when we were really making a run the
fireman hadnt much time for whistling
wood in a fire-box dont last like anthra-
cite

   many of the cabless engines had
crank-axle drivers that were continually
breaking many times we had to stop in
a blinding snow-storm and make repairs
the boys of to-day have a lot to be
thankful for

   i never had much trouble in taking
hold of improvements as they came
along a short period of instruction
was sufficient i had more trouble get-
ting used to the air-brake than anything
else when you have been keeping com-
pany with hand-brakes for a good many
years its hard to give em up and flirt
with air

   passenger-coaches were quite com-
fortable in the early fifties for the
reason i think that all coaches were the
property of private companies who let
them to the railroads at so much a year
no railroads owned their coaches in
those days so far as i know among
the coach companies whose names i re-
call were the miller schofield and peo-
ples companies and the rivalry between
them brought much comfort to the
traveling public

old snow-fences still standing

   there were no independent baggage-
cars baggage was carried on a sort of
shelf below the passenger-car ever
seen a mammy possum with her babies
clinging to her while she tried to get
away from you then youll understand
why these baggage-cars were christened
 possum-bellies

   as traffic and the baggage business
increased cars were set aside for the
transportation of passengers belongings 
but until late in the fifties the possum-
belly was a common sight on eastern
roads

   no sir there were no dining-cars in
those days passengers either stocked
themselves up with grub or we stopped
the train near a handy hotel along the
line and waited until the meal was fin-
ished these stops made a pleasant
 r r

break in a long journey and didnt inter-
fere much with the schedule

   another thing that we didnt have in
the early days was the snow-plow when
the track had to be cleared we used to
couple together six or eight engines and
buck the drift sometimes we got
through and sometimes we didnt if
stalled we simply had to wait until the
weather did what we couldnt

   but we did rig up snow-fences and
i believe that we were the first line in
the east to do so at various points in
pennsylvania the fences are still stand-
ing which were erected when i was a
young man they are about as high as
your chin

   fifty-five years ago the average
speed of a passenger-train was about
twenty miles an hour on occasions i
boosted her up to thirty but not often
nowadays people kick if they cant be
shot along three times as fast its sure-
ly a rapid age were living in-a very
rapid age but do we get quite as much
fun out of life as we used to i doubt
it we are so busy speeding that we
havent time to enjoy anything but the
speed

lucky in wrecks

  was i in many wrecks during my
railroading naturally wrecks are a
part of the business but im proud to
say that no human life was ever lost in
all the smash-ups in which i figured

   luck maybe hut it was fortunate
luck consequently i sleep all the sounder
i ran into and  was run into but as
ive said nary a man woman or child
passed away in one of those smash-ups
what is more i never was hurt badly
myself

   the only time i was really bunged
up was when i was riding as a passen-
ger on that occasion i had ended my
days run at philadelphia and was re-
turning home on a passenger-car just
this side of paoli we struck a broken
rail and the car went down the embank-
ment

   such an accident confuses a man it
was a minute or so before i could make
out what had happened or where i was
then i discovered that i was as near
standing on my ear as i ever expect to
be and my toes were close to my head


railroad mans magazine

  mr jeffries laughed loud and long at
the remembrance of his predicament
and throwing himself back in his chair
he tried to give a graphic illustration of
the position in which he found himself

   dont do that charles you may
hurt yourself reproved miss jeffries

  the old man brought his feet from
above his head and with a broad smile
continued his story

   the car was upside down and so
were all of us who were inside just
then we heard some one outside cry
 fire  and the smell of smoke came to
us i kicked out a window and scram-
bled through our car was in flames
all right and a pretty lively time we had
rescuing the rest of my traveling com-
panions when the excitement was
over i discovered that i had hurt my
right instep badly so much so that i was
laid up for weeks

  i asked mr jeffries from what classes
or trades the railroads in the old days
secured their men

   if a man wanted to become a fire-
man or an engineer said mr jeffries
 he must have had some acquaintance
with machinery i inherited a liking for
wheels from my father which accounts
for my being a mechanic before i took
to railroading then too lancaster
was always a manufacturing town and
the boys here were more or less familiar

with machinery when the pennsylvania
railroad took over the other road there
was a rush of young men from this town
to the main offices of the company in
many cases their applications were suc-
cesssful

   a love of railroading is born in a
man theres my son charles noth-
ing would do but that he follow his
fathers example although he had
chances in other directions so to rail-
roading he went became a conductor on
the pennsy and kept on the job until a
coupling-engine impaired his usefulness
he too is on the pension list and lives
close by our company certainly does
look after its old men its good policy
a man takes care of a job if he knows
that when his working days are over
hell be looked after by his employers

   when i was a boy this country was
so wild that we used to hunt bear and
other animals now look at the land
and what brought about the change
the railroad

   when one thinks what the railroads
have done the world over it makes him
feel proud to be a railroad man

  when i started to catch my train for
new york the old engineer gripped my
hand keenly and said

   come and help me celebrate my
hundredth birthday

  i hope to have that privilege

electricity for freight handling

in the discussion of the use of electricity
on railways a new note is struck by
e m herr president of the westing-
house electric and manufacturing com-
pany he takes the advantages of elec-
tricity in passenger terminals as accepted
and puts the stress on the advantages of
electricity in collecting moving and dis-
tributing and delivering freight

   the statement has been made says mr
herr  that the cost of moving a ton of
freight from the point at which it originates
to the railway-car which is to carry it by rail
to the railway terminal of its destination
added to the additional cost of delivering
it from car to consignees store factory
or warehouse is as large as the entire
charge for rail transportation for a large
proportion of freight handled by rail which
lias to be delivered by dray or truck

  why then should not the railways them-
selves arrange to collect and deliver freight
especially package freight at terminals

  the question is pertinent the english
railways do this

   here again electricity can be of great
service in furnishing the power to drive the
telpherage for loading and unloading cars
and supply the motive power of a fleet of
auto trucks and drays so handled as to
cause the minimum delay of freight cars at
terminals and promptest delivery of pack-
age freight at the lowest cost further
says mr herr no business man is likely
to doubt that the work could be done by
the railways at less cost than by the shippers
and consignees except in unusual conditions

  as to the economy of electricity as mo-
tive power for trains mr herr thinks that
the concentration of electrical power plants
into enormous installations of centralized
plants so located as to distribute power
over large areas at minimum cost would
result in a saving of  tons of
coal by conservative estimate every year

cargoes for eleven ships

r

tth captain tuttle safely-
sequestered on board the
belle of the south im-
mune from feminine in-
terference we were ready
for business addicks
scattered the word that the h t p
company was in the open market for
fruit

  the surrounding country responded
with alacrity to a bountifulness that sur-
passed all expectations

  they made a clean-up by bullock-
carts and pack-donkeys a motley horde
brought the luscious green banan the
juicy unripe orange the fig the coconut
the date truly there was endless va-
riety yam papaw chilli-pepper and
tapioca brought they them - and great
was the stir and hubbub thereof

  brigands from a distance of four or
five miles swarthy stalwart swaggering
and black-browed dumped their offer-
ings to the right to the left-anywhere
but the right place-and joined in the
general bedlam of jabber and gesticula-
tion

  addicks mrs brown mrs smith
mrs robinson and i received and paid
for the fruit at the wharf warehouse
miss vandiver and aunt bev were
present but not of any particular use
both were scared silly

  i myself at times felt daunted when
fifteenor twenty shouting wild-eyed
pig-latins surrounded us apparently

began in the february railroad mani ma

 clamoring for our blood addicks how-
 ever sat imperturbable throughout the
 uproar

    ha-hadnt we better call the military
 or the policeos i asked during one
 particularly hair-raising demonstration
 as a snarling rioter in a red sash menaced
 me with both hands upraised and
 screamed some awful denunciation

     that fellow says liell take five pesos
 for his whole load addicks explained
 patiently  give him his credit slip

   all altercations and disagreements be-
 ing settled without the actual shedding
 of blood the mob dispersed and the dove
 of peace came forth from its barricaded
 cote whence it had taken refuge chir-
 ruping happily once more

   the h t p company-or the mi-
 nority stockholders in charge-then did
 a little lightning calculating took off a
 trial balance-sheet using new orleans
 market quotations of two days previous
 plus freight and switching charges re-
 ice at atlanta and richmond and notify
 promptly by wire-er yes-and found
 that they had cleared the snug figure of
  or some such sum

   everybody felicitated everybody and
 mrs brown dictated a long letter to
 captain tuttle instructing him to ap-
 prise all and various freight-steamers he
 might meet going or coming that the
 company was prepared to charter barter
 or purchase for cash to carry tropical
 products from hither to thence

   but let us get back to the brick-yard
 the railroad poked its nose five miles
 farther meanwhile and honks well-
 baked face fused by the heat had

welded itself permanently into a large
mahogany-colored smile he strongly in-
dorsed the fruit-shipping venture and
said that for amateurs we had made a
splendid beginning

  he went so far as to predict an im-
mediate commercial success of such ex-
travagant proportions that i found my-
self actually feeling sorry for the steel
and oil magnates with their compara-
tively picayune enterprises

  the belle of the south steamed away
with the stars and stripes at the bat and
captain edgebcrt tuttle on deck and
santa maria once more wrapped the
drapery of its couch about herself and
lay down to pleasant dreams

  at exactly three oclock and thirty-
three and one-third minutes post merid-
ian a shadow passed between me and
the sun it was a pigeon addicks
brought the message along presently

   los cocos quite lively wrote cush-
ing  citizens waking up saw two
men on the street within last hour
about to obtain important option on
rubber-tree tract details later

  time and tide keep moving hasten
fellow sluggards lest we get lost in the
shuffle skip a week-two weeks ah
thanks old scythe-bearer

  came a dulcet evening when but a
scant three or four miles intervened
twixt honks track-layers and los cocos
save that insignificant gap-a mere step
as it were-the task was finished

  forty-odd miles of steel highway
stretched like a gray ribbon of sun-baked
earth through jungle and field a strip of
alien soil a stones throw in width at
whose edges the quick-sprouting vegeta-
tion stopped nonplused a few crawl-
ing creepers ventured out but soon grew
discouraged

  the jungle respected honks edict
 thus far shall you come but no
farther 

  already along the line budding sta-
tions of grass and dobe huts were
springing into being overnight like
fungi prospects were good for a rous-
ing local passenger business when the
line should be formally opened for
traffic

  honk and i sat desultorily discussing
these things over our post-prandial pipes
as the logical sequence of a pipe is
smoke i presently marked in the north-

east a dense smudge of the same it
looked like the caribbean sea was on
lire i made some sort of an illuminated
remark to that effect

   ships quoth honk laconically
 must be a whole fleet maybe the
atlantic squadron is down here browsing
around

  if such was the case it soon became
evident that they were about to pay us
a visit a numerous covey of vessels
rose out of the deep and headed lickety-
cut for the bay of bonagua

  i counted twelve - lost count - re-
counted and made it fourteen honk
tried it and announced a total of seven-
teen schooners one sloop and a four-
masted tug-but i think he got excited

  by actual enumeration the armada
compromised ten in all flying half a
dozen different flags

  the belle of the south was among
them it turned out that she was lead-
ing the outfit captain tuttle had ran-
sacked the seas for fruiterers and his
drag-net had made a variegated haul

  a little of unnecessary red tape was
involved in getting down to plain busi-
ness with captain tuttle he first sent
esteban as envoy non-potentiary bearing
a note addressed to  any authorized
male representative of the h t p
company

 esteban couldnt read ritin so he
gave the note to me it stated that one
edgebert tuttle in command of the ship
belle of the south would be pleased lo
arrange for a meeting either on shore
or on board his ship for the transaction
of all matters of a business nature-the
discussion of future plans etc - and
that no women of whatsoever descrip-
tion were to be present

  we sent a reply couched in the formal
phraseology of courts-legal and liege-
expressing our abject contrition for be-
ing alive how overwhelmed we were at
the implied honor conferred upon us
and hoped he would feel free to suit his
own convenience in regard to the pro-
posed conference

  that made him sore he disembarked
in the middle of the night with his tin
box under his arm and insisted on ren-
dering his reports before morning

  an all-night session resulted honk
said however that it was in line with
everything else connected with the com-
honk and horace



pan he said the whole project was
irregular if not actually illegal but lie
wound up with a poetic allusion in which
the words  clog eat dog  were used as
a foundation for philosophical purposes

  after matters pertaining to the initial
voyage had been adjusted there ensued
a couple of days haggling through go-
betweens between mrs brown and com-
pany and sundry and various skippers
of tramp freighters

  contracts were ultimately signed with
all of em and then the company got
busy trying to find cargoes for the eleven
stout ships i forgot to mention that one
slow-goer arrived after the official count
was announced

  cargoes for eleven ships

  w hat say we make this phase of the
narrative more vividly interesting by do-
ing a running broad jump over the de-
tails of this monumental task

  while in the air ill take occasion to
say that we enjoyed a week or ten days
of near-carnival excitement and that we
bought and loaded some fruit if any-
body asks you but we accomplished it
-assisted by the entire population of
that section of central america tis true
likewise the railroad which helped a lot

  we stood a bit tousled mayhap and
fruit-stained but very hopeful at the
waters edge on a scintillant summers
morning watching our fleet of goodly
ships sail away

  the first trip of the belle of the south
had netted mrs brown and her associate
venturers a neat five-figured sum -
 or  if i remember cor-
rectly and eleven times siooo or
tooo as the case may be is something
to contemplate on a scintillant summers
morning at the edge of the slobbering
sea

  while in the throes of this sublime
ecstasy so to speak how natural it is
that the ridiculous must needs obtrude
itself upon us i saw a stodgy figure on
the deck of a receding ship-i think it
was the bouncing betty-and i started
in surprise

  for as one pea is like unto another
the figure was a living presentment of
the recreant and all but forgotten cap-
tain toomey the same square-cornered
bull-terrier pose the round body short
neck grape-shot head surmounted by a
faded blue bent-vizored cap-i stared

open-mouthed much after the manner of
one who sees a long-lost ghost

  the figure stood glowering then raised
an arm and shook what looked like a
clenched fist at the poetic scene it was
leaving

  i clutched the arm of addicks with
one hand and the shoulder of honk with
the other

   look quick  i exclaimed  on
the deck of the next to last boat see
the man that looks like napoleon taking
his last rubber at france a toothpick
to a ten-dollar bill that thats our old
friend toomey 

   impossible   said honk

   at all events unusual agreed ad-
dicks

   just the same if that isnt toomey
ill eat my hat i insisted but to
make sure ill run to the cuartcl and
find out to an absolute certainty

  i didnt run the entire distance-it
was too far and the weather was too
ardent for marathoning-nevertheless i
made good time on the trip

  once there i awoke the solitary guard
in charge and we conversed quite a
while afterward we arrived at some sort
of a misunderstanding to the effect that
 desired greatly to look upon the one
large-girthed prisonero of a  muchness
the to swear  and also the to eat-eat
ah sacramento senor yes

  whereupon we entered the kennels
we traversed a runway or corridor my
conductor continued to talk and did not
hurry the cubby-hole allotted to the
hungry and profane americano capitan
was in the far end

  we reached it in time but unfortu-
nately too late the captain wasnt in
but there was a hole opening or aperture
in the rear wall of a size sufficient to ad-
mit the passage of a person of captain
toomeys portliness

  the guard seized upon this clue almost
instantly he rolled his eyes and spoke
rapidly

   hola dios was it possible the pig
had rooted his way out anirno que-
dito ohe help help

  i coincided with his views politely and
bowed myself out the place had an
odor anyhow outside i bethought me
of the captains threatened cablegram
it was but a step to the telegrafos-office
i harked thither


railroad mans magazine

  for two dollars and fifty cents the
clerkeos assured me that captain too-
mey had indeed despatched a message
several hours before for five dollars i
would be allowed to read the same with
ni- own eyes yes but the two fifty
was all i had with me so  took the fel-
lows word for the rest

  addicks viewed the matter more light-
ly than  had persuaded myself to expect
he even indulged in a ripple of amuse-
ment

   theres no cause for general alarm
said he  were pretty well entrenched
in our position why need we try to
evade the issue let stringfellow and
his friends come - when they choose
as for the belligerent toomey-i had
already arranged with ramonez to set
him at liberty this evening he might
have saved his finger-nails if-exctisc me
 think miss vandiver is calling

  honk went back jauntily to his last
league of sunburning and i-well i
took my regular afternoon off i re-
flected with momentary regret that 
might have been two dollars and a half
better off financially if i had been a little
less pertinacious that morning still-the
future looked roseate enough for all
practical purposes

  the day the railroad was completed
we all felt a wee mite elated even mrs
robison mustered a semimelancholy
burst of exuberance for the occasion
though habitually conservative

  and all along the line from santa
maria to los cocos we instigated vivas
and flag-waving and wholesale rejoicing
these things help

  any small outlay of expense in such
cases may be freely charged to adver-
tising for results will justify the same
without exception therefore we re-
laxed as mentioned ran an excursion
train festooned with orange-blossoms
and fastcr lilies and carried everybody
clothed or unclothed free of charge

  lemonade flowed and the population
sung songs and whooped it up all day
it was a festal occasion-a gala day

  that evening we had social inveigle-
ments and a far-famed spread in the
bungalow all the state and municipal
dignitaries were present with their
sciloras and senorifas

  the lord mayor the dog-catcher and
the minister of interstate commerce were

in uniform cushing came over with all
the haciendados and dadesses of los co-
cos including la senorita zuela carre-
ras who was reputed to be wealthy be-
yond dreams of artifice and twice as
beautiful as that besides being young in
her own right

  i noticed that cushing kept one eye on
her during the evening nevertheless
addicks was insanely jealous because
miss vandiver danced with him twice
honk led a cotillion or minuet or some-
thing with mrs brown and i sat out
three or four vanilla ices with aunt
beverly-travis

  at midnight the joyous throng had
just begun to feel thoroughly at home
at  am the revelry was atits height
at four oclock toasts were drunk stand-
ing so you see-

  but fifteen minutes later the smiling
and suave sefior don jose de passemen-
terie or whatever his name was minister
of highways and byways of the repub-
lic rattled his medals and insignia
tapped his chest bowed smiled and by
means of other delightful mannerisms
signified that hed been holding back a
pleasant surprise for us but that the mo-
ment was then sufficiently mellow etc
etc

  principals and auxiliaries representing
the h t p company there assembled
kotowed and accorded the distinguished
gentleman the most courteous and polite
attention

  he spoke in a garbled way of the rich
anh powerful company of its marvelous
stur endous and supereminent success
of his country-her generosity her pa-
triotism of himself - a particularly
warm number and then he unrolled a
large crackly foolscap scroll bearing the
great red-ribboned seal of state and read
a string of extravagant spanish verbiage
in fitting climax to his impassioned and
unintelligible eloquence

  mrs brown tittered her appreciation
of the tribute

  the other ladies fluttered their fan-
and tried to look demure honk and i
bowed and smirked personally i hadnt
made head or tail of any of it but i felt
sure it was nothing less than a proffer
of the keys to the city - possibly the
entire country

  but addicks stood in somber silence
a black frown on his noble brow when
honk and horace



the pause threatened to become a rest
lie spoke

   allow me to translate the dope-sheet
senor he said  there are those who
do not understand-

  twas well don jose curled his mus-
tachios with a flourish

  addicks took the paper when con-
verted into the parlance of the anointed
it certainly did read something fierce
being no more or less than a polite stick-
up

  the honduras tropical products
company being seized of certain valu-
able franchises and perquisites was duly
notified that in the course of human
events it had been deemed necessary to
levy a most gracious specific and prop-
erly authorized tax in the nature of a
pecuniary occupation license or some-
thing amounting in round numbers to
thirty-five thousand seven hundred sixty-
nine dollars and fifty-four cents same to
be paid within ten days in united slates
money

  yes carrambos

   i want to know  said mrs brown

chapter xvi
neath the ceiba-trees

 vvthat i want to know demanded
 honk in clarion tones  is the
alternative if we refuse to be blackmailed
in this way by these pirates 

  the minister of mud-holes grimaced
and flicked his epaulets

   ah the droll-the amusing senor
simpson he said with a flash of gold-
embossed teeth  the alternative-yes
i am instruct to say only so much eef
the tax be not paid in diez dias-no
then will my country of the sureness be
compel to confeescate all shall we take
of the propertees the railway yes
the houses - las casas yes the
lands the load-wharfs yes the
sheeps-

   sheeps  snapped mrs brown
the mans crazy we have no live
stock

   ships explained addicks  don
jose uses the plural for oratorical effect
seeing that we have but one ship and it
is no great shakes still my friends in
a less flippant tone  theres no getting
around the bald truth in a good part of

his statements it is a time-honored
custom among these third-rate countries
to levy tribute from whom they can it
is their goose with the golden egg ive
been expecting it all along

   i hardly thought theyd put the
screws quite so forcibly to start on
thirty-six thousand is rather ambitious
somebodys been doing a little apprais-
ing the fruit companies are always
held up for a slice of easy money in this
way unless -he bowed to the smi-
ling senor - the fruit companies re-
adjust the government

  don jose ceased to smile

  but the contribution - she will be
pay  said he

   we shant pay it  declared mrs
brown  we do not intend to be bun-
coed out of money right and left at the
beck and call of these heathen 

   that we do not  corroborated mrs
smith

   oh dear  murmured miss van-
diver addicks stiffened instantly

   at least we have ten days of grace
he remarked  there is  cause for
immediate anxiety much may happen
in ten days my good friend don jose
there is a most magnificent moonlight
view from the esplanade shall we
smoke a cigar there while we stroll  

   with a supremeness of to be happy
acquiesced the dignitary genially

  the celebration adjourned soon after-
ward i thought it had been unduly pro-
longed anyway so far as i was con-
cerned early to bed meaning  am
and early to rise make a man baggy
under the eyes

  cushing decided under protest to re-
main in santa maria for a day or two
so it devolved on him to escort the ladies
to the imogen i noticed that he tore
himself away from the los cocos dele-
gation only when mcmuir had the special
train well under way

  honk sat with his head between his
forepaws immersed in profound medita-
tion for a long time after the last shout
of revelry died away in the distance

   do you know he blurted presently
 ive got a clairvoyant hunch that
theres something irregular about this
tax business

   impossible   i retorted  who-
ever heard of such a thing in this
country  


railroad mans magazine

   what assurance have we he con-
tinued  that this isnt a scheme between
addicks and the don josiah passepar-
tout to cop out a little easy money
couldnt they divvy up and nobody be
the wiser sure they could further-
more-

   but addicks is head over heels in
love with miss vandiver i argued

   maybe he is and maybe he isnt
hes a sly dog youll admit maybe he
needs the money to marry on-

    wont believe lies crooked i said
firmly  i wont entertain it wait till
you hear the returns from the esplanade
perhaps youll change your mind

  honk can be rather obstinate when he
thinks he has one of his clairvoyant
hunches as he calls them he waggled
his head pessimistically i went to bed

  addicks ill have to confess was
somewhat vague in his replies to ques-
tions oil the morrow he observed mild-
ly that he saw  reason for anxiety or
alarm just then

  he said that don quixote had been
altogether too high-priced to start out
with but that there might be a slump in
the market later also that there was
a remote possibility of course that a
company ultimately might be forced to
come through to save their bacon

  i had to admit that for a diplomatic
representative who was supposed to have
the interests of his constituents at heart
he seemed unconcerned-even though his
clients were about to be strong-armed
out of a considerable sum of cash money
honk was more suspicious than before

  mrs brown and company came on the
scene before we had finished shaving and
garbing ourselves properly for public
appearance

  well said mrs brown in the
manner of a supreme court handing
down an important decision  we have
threshed it all out archie gave us the
idea he has such a mind for legal mat-
ters we have planned our course thor-
oughly archie says this tax has been
levied according to law

  if it isnt paid the usual procedure
is for the government to sell the property
of the delinquent for the debt whoever
buys it in is granted a tax-title which
stands good in law archie has gone to
the mayor or the united states consul
or somewhere to confirm this

   if its all straight we will allow the
government to sell the goods and chat-
tels of the old company according to
law then as a new company we shall
bid in the property pay the money and
take over the title the original stock-
holders will then be entirely out of the
enterprise theyll have nothing more to
say it is a splendid idea archie
thought of it

   but- interposed addicks

    now dont tell us it isnt feasible or
i shant like you said miss vandiver

    i was about to say he continued
mildly  that the former management
would be allowed bv law to redeem the
concession within a stated time

   by paying the amount of the tax
levied with an additional penalty yes 
said mrs brown  but well be able to
delay settlement for  telling how long
by fighting it through the courts in the
mean time we shall run the business and
pocket the proceeds

  addicks bowed low

   as a mere tyro in such things he
murmured  i beg to bend the knee in
homage to you ladies

  cushing came in during these ameni-
ties he reported hurriedly that every-
thing was propitious the method of pro-
cedure was exactly as theyd counted on
and the coup would be easy-even sim-
pler than looting a babys lxink he then
excused himself saying that an im-
portant option or something made it
imperative that he should catch the
eleven oclock train for los cocos

  miss vandiver for no apparent
reason smiled engagingly at addicks

  i wonder if by any hook or crook i
could squeeze through a love scene in
the next ten or fifteen minutes ive
a hundred other things of far greater
importance-well here goes

  first the setting a nook neath the
ceiba-trees for background the tropic
green of leaf and shoot mingled with the
paler tints of feathery fronds and the
yellow and white of bursting blossoms
here and there like a savages head-
dress of clustered plumes clumps of
coconut palms

  for foreground the molten mirror of
the shimmering sea above the limpid
azure of the sky around the golden
sunshine the twitter of birds the hum-
mings and rustlings and whisperings of
i ionic and horace



life in its myriad forms seen and un-
seen be that as it may-

  addicks and miss vandiver started
for a stroll to see a red-headed green
paroquets nest having a moments
leisure i watched them with a fatherly
interest from the bungalow window in
spite of honks morbid suspicions i re-
mained loyal to addicks

  if he loved fanny vandiver i gave
him my hearty mental and moral sup-
port i boosted for him telepathically
being thus in on the deal so to speak i
had a desire to see the outcome so i got
out honks binoculars and stood at the
window

  they strolled he plucked for her a
posy they looked at each other and at
the sighing sea addicks seemed to be
talking she pointed with gloved finger
at something-a bird a tree-but ad-
dicks continued to seem to be talking

  she allowed him to carry the parasol
they were a long way along the shore
where the thin white line of surf feath-
ered and broke on the sands and
finally they came to a nook neath the
ceiba-trees-weve already had that-the
setting

  so they sat on a great boulder and
addicks took her hand  he talked
some more    she listened with face
averted    but he seemed determined
to say his say    she looked up de-
murely and suddenly swayed    but
she didnt fall-far   dont
leave out the dots mr printer

   and his arm stole   
but the parasol intervened  bother

  they returned a little late for
luncheon both radiantly radiant aunt
beverly - travis pretended to chide
who pray was aunt beverly-travis to
intrude her idle chatter upon the sublime
somnambulism of loves young dream
poof forsooth 

  what do you say now t asked
when i had recounted the incident to
honk  hardly likely that addicks
would double-cross his affianced wife for
the sake of a petty graft is it 

  maybe he would and maybe he
wouldnt honk grunted evasively
hes a penniless adventurer aint he
looks to me like a case of everything to
gain and nothing to lose hes a good
fellow all right likable and agreeable
and all that and so far as im con-

cerned i only hope he dont burn his
fingers in some kind of an intrigue be-
fore hes through humph  

chapter xvii
whos who and whats what

tvt one but a foolish pool - player

   would essay to pocket all the balls
at a single cue-thrust likewise he is a
thoughtless merchant who allows all his
bills to come due  the same day

  tragic then shall be the fate of the
careless artificer in words who weaves
half a score of promising plots helter-
skelter and ultimately is confronted by
the nerve-racking task of gathering in
the flying threads at one swoop wo
wo indeed for many and merciless
shall be the critics that camp on the
bunglers trail

  in the teeth of all this i shall yet
continue i am of a rash and foolhardy
race a people that cares naught for
consequences and very little for ex-
penses  a people that goes in lemons if
they come out squeezed

  so i shall grab in the loose ends of
this narrative with one lightning swipe
and clip bind and tie the climaxes neat-
ly in a bundle like stogies submitting
them with a single twist of the wrist

  and as the ponies come bunched in
the final dash down the stretch to flit
under the wire in solid phalanx so shall
the action close if i shouldnt see you
at the finish i take this occasion to say
good-by and good luck old pals

  all right lets go 

  mrs brown and her devoted coterie
awaited with scant patience the day set
for the projected confiscation sale pur-
chase and reorganization of the h t
p companys possession

  we toilers in the bungalow office paid
little attention to the details being occu-
pied with a rush of passenger and freight
traffic  the railroad

  we supposed it was all cut and dried
addicks spent most of his waking hours
in the company of miss vandiver which
made news scarce

  the night before the big day tuttle
returned with his flotilla

  day dawned  a busy scene a bay
full of ships a town full of sailors the
clank and clatter of a dozen vessels in


railroad mans magazine

a roadstead is considerable even though
every soul on board be ashore on the
streets bare-legged natives stared won-
deringly at noisy groups of sailors

  a bit before noon there came a heavy
tramping on the stairs the door open-
ed mrs brown mrs smith and mrs
robison entered they seemed per-
turbed

   we have just come from the what-
you-may-call-it of the government
vouchsafed mrs brown  we took the
united stales consul with us the sec-
retario of the foreign affairs department
of this one-horse country as i think he
called himself and several other mulat-
to gentlemen were present

   we informed them through the
consul that we had come to attend the
sale of the h t p companys property
according to law they chattered among
themselves and looked in a lot of books
each appeared to be a bigger fool than
the next one we were informed that
there was no tax on record against us
 but don josephus lives at the capi-
tal you know said honk  it may be
that you went to the wrong place per-
haps you should telegraph-

  no we went to the right place
they admitted that there had been such
a tax levied but said that it had been
canceled further than that they either
couldnt or wouldnt say it is a mys-
terious business weve been virtually
swindled out of the property

   ill venture that addicks- began
honk

   pardon me said i from the win-
dow overlooking the harbor  a long
low slate-colored vessel that looks like
a steam-yacht just warped up against the
wharf a few minutes ago could it be
anybody were not expecting i also
notice addicks and captain tuttle com-
ing this way across the plaza you ladies
were supposed not to meet him

   botheration  said mrs brown
 we cant be eternally running from
that man come girls we will go
into the next room and close the door
and remember  she waggled a warn-
ing finger  we shall be listening gov-
ern yourselves accordingly 

  captain tuttle bore under his arm the
inevitable tin box

  addicks appeared to be in a remark-
able state of mental exaltation from

some cause or other evinced by his
flushed face and sparkling eyes some-
thing had happened that was entirely to
his liking doubtless i glanced out the
window from force of habit

  aha i sung out also kola
and ohe four men approaching off the
port bow to board us shall we lower
the portcullis lord belwether

  honk reconnoitered

   stringfellovv and his gang by
cricky he exclaimed now for the
explosion 

  addicks grinned in an altogether fatu-
ous and dreamy fashion

   ahem   coughed tuttle  praps
id better withdraw for the present ill
step into the next room

  he opened the partition door walked
in and-without waiting to turn around
backed right out again

  if im any judge of physiognomical
phenomena id say that his face depicted
horror superstition disgust relief and
a kind of grim saturnine satisfaction
by that time there was heard the tread
of marching feet on the stairs escape
was cut off captain tuttle folded his
arms over his tin box and waited

  stringfellow sleek and self-possessed
latham blond and beaming cabell-
kingsland no less well-groomed and
gracious entered jauntily

  ah thought i the same suave smiling
scoundrels who had laughed at honk and
me it was our turn  rubbed my
hands in anticipation

   ah gentlemen murmured string-
fellovv nodding to all and blinking at us
with his yellow cats eyes  how goes
the game business seems rushing from
indications outside ships in the harbor
-hurry and bustle in the town ad-
dicks youre looking well-

   cant complain said addicks se-
renely  i spose you all are here as a
result of toomeys cable 

   um no - we received no cable
we came in fact-but whats up any-
body making trouble  by the way how
about the minority people i presume
theyre all safely tamed and ready to eat
out of the hand ere this-

  the inner room door creaked slightly
as it swung back in the opening the
flushed and angry face of mrs brown
shone like a harvest moon stringfellow
shrank back with a look of horrified
honk and horace



surprise instantly replaced by one of
anxious inquiry and-oh half a dozen
other mixed expressions  made ready
to laugh but didnt

  marian lie cried you here
wh-what does this mean

  mrs bro-stringfellow came forth
trumpeting  what does it mean is it
it means considerable jotham string-
fellow  were the minority people are
we safely tamed to eat out of the
hand eh  

  the other ladies came from behind
and stood scowling defiance

  it was lathams and cabells turn to
do some exclaiming

   elinor from latham

  clarissa from cabell

   you the minority stockholders-
stammered stringfellow- i - i cant
understand er - ah - cushing repre-
sented to us that a syndicate purchased
the shares

   we were the syndicate sir we
bought the stock to help archie get start-
ed in his broker business he has re-
paid us by coming down here and falling
in love with one of these mulatto girls
too the ingrate but that has nothing
to do with your villainous schemes to rob
us of our money-

   tut tut marian havent i warned
you many times about dabbling into
things that you know nothing about
ive no doubt you led the others into it
now you-

  now i what thundered his wife
 you unscrupulous wretch dont dare
to criticize me you and your thieving
company-with your robbing and plun-
dering of helpless women and orphans
how dare you oh i shall lay hands
on you in another minute 

  my attention was diverted to captain
tuttle he placed his tin box unosten-
tatiously on honks desk his honest
face was lighted by a smile of surpassing
effulgence exquisite enjoyment of a
long-deferred revenge transfigured him
phe fact that his enemies were married
to each other seemed to strike him all at
once as being sufficient punishment he
stepped softly from the room

   that was edgebert tuttle said
mrs stringfellow he is an honest
man i might have married him one
day if i had been gifted with the sense

the

of a goose but i chose a captain of
finance instead humph  

   well how much are you out mari-
an  asked jotham p meekly  maybe
we can save something from the wreck

  out were not out anything
weve made money lots of it thou-
sands and thousands of dollars out
i want to know thanks to mr simp-
son and mr addicks and mr-well a
number of others

    then whats the controversy about 
another interruption yes it was
our busy day at the bungalow

  enter aunt beverly-travis accom-
panied by-our leading juvenile they
were a little tardy

   oh dear  may we come in  asked
miss vandiver prettily

  kingsland beaming with recognition
sprang forward with marked haste

   why who would have dreamed of
seeing you here he effused how
nice fanny vandiver of all people 
but aunt beverly-travis obtruded
herself adroitly and received the brunt
of the attack

   oh no you dont edwin kings-
land   she laughed merrily  you may
flirt with me if you like but this is-
mrs lon j addicks if you please since
nearly two hours ago

  gracious me said mrs string-
fellow  married to a poor man with
nothing but a salary 

   my dear marian interposed jotham
p mildly  there is some mistake
somewhere four months ago or there-
about we disposed of all our rights
title and interest in the honduras trop-
ical products company to mr lon 
addicks for cash in hand lailess he has
since disposed of it he owns the con-
trolling interest in a million-dollar cor-
poration which according to your state-
ment is well established and on a paving
basis

    i want to know   she said  then
mr lon j addicks you are the man
who squelched that tax-title

   h-m - yes i believe there was
something of the kind drawled the
culprit  you see it would have been
all right for - er - mrs addicks but
where would i have been  i had to pay
it-or-er-arrange the matter to pro-
tect myself

jj d winnipeg canada-the length of

	the main line of the canadian pacific
montreal to vancouver is  miles that of
the transsiberian is  miles vladivostok
to moscow the train on the transsiberian

   	wet or properly saturated steam is that
with just enough heat to keep it from con-

 densing dry steam is practically saturated
 steam but usually that which does not have
 over two per cent of entrained water super-
 heated steam is that which has been heated
 when not in contact with water and hence has
 a higher temperature than saturated or dry
 steam at the same pressure

v

 fp detroit-your friend was no doubt
  correct in the statement that the  fly-
 ing scotchman  between london and glasgow
 had made  miles an hour as the writer
 timed it at that speed more than once hut if
 he meant to imply that the scotchman had
 made the entire run of  miles between the
 two places at the average rate of  miles an
 hour the statement is of course absurd the
 time is practically eight hours and therefore
 the average speed is  miles per hour in-
 cluding stops of which there are very few
 and only for the purpose of changing engines
 this is a long-distance train and it would be
 hard to improve on the average

gb m west orange new jersey-the

	editor must confess that he is puzzled
by two of your questions viz  how may the
boiler elevation of the backhead be deter-
mined and please explain the best mode
for throttle fastening in the case of the
first we thought you might mean a description
of the best and most accurate manner to lo-
cate the gage-cock holes in the backhead but
after a long study concluded to give it up and
let you come again in regard to the other
if you mean the throttle-valve it is considered
the best practise to bolt it firmly to a brace
which is riveted to the dome this of course
to resist the downward pull when the valve is
seated which would soon move it out of place
at the dry-pipe joint they are all secured in
about the same way if on the other hand
you have reference to the throttlc-levcr in the
cab they are now universally fastened by a
latch of some four teeth which engage the
throttle-rack or quadrant in any desired posi-
tion years ago thumbscrews were commonly

used for this purpose and the throttle-quad-
rants were not notched

large drawing sometimes  x  feet which is
generally placed on a convenient board on the

ance of the gang setting up the engine of

ings in addition but the large one gives a
graphic idea of the location of the parts and
how the machine will look when completed
the same applies to the erecting-card for cab-
fittings indicating the position of these parts in

   the actual weight of the nails should be

if a string of  cars was being pushed by

  if the locomotives were of equal power as
you say and the cars with their loading of
equal weight the point of slack should be
logically about half-way the train but so many
things have to be taken into consideration that
it is practically impossible to assign a definite
location for it it would constantly vary due
to the change in grade variation in tractive-
effort of the engines and many other causes

jo h long beach california-in the

	majority of various designs of screw
reverse a form of pointer or index is em-
ployed to indicate the varying degrees of cut-
off this can be done in a number of ways
but the writer is of the opinion that the
standard on the austrian state railways is
the best if ten turns of the reverse-wheel are
required to go from full-forward to full-back
motion each turn is indicated and if the figure
   should appear in the proper place it
would imply that the engine was  out of
gear as it would be in the old-style reverse-
gear with the lever in the center of the
quadrant

oh s stanton iowa - supplementing

	our reply to you in the july number
in regard to brakemen-operators we have
since been advised that the former denver

utah and grand junction colorado hired
operator-brakemen in passenger-service about
thirteen years ago they carried box-relays
and crossing the utah desert where offices
were very few the company had boxes 
telegraph-poles at blind-sidings closed with
switch-locks and containing the despatchers
wire the correspondent supplying this in-
formation however is of the opinion that this
practise has been discontinued as increased
business has called for many additional offices

have any locomotives speed-recorders so
that the engineer can tell the number of
miles per hour he is traveling-a a
r kansas city missouri

  it is practically a universal practise to have
these on locomotives hauling fast trains in
europe but there are only isolated instances
where they have been applied here abroad
the maximum speed regulations are so strict

being imposed by the governments that it is
necessary to have a certain check or record
for each run the recording mechanism is
generally located  the running-board as
nearly above one of the engine-truck wheels
as possible and the roll of paper within is
revolved by a drive from one of the engine-

mil chicago-we fail to understand

	your question in relation to  friction
in a locomotive boiler when fired you
state referring to the old stourbridge lion
 the steam was raised at between  and 
pounds although there was no friction
would like to know what causes this fric-
tion the editor is rather inclined to the


railroad mans magazine

opinion that internal friction in the locomotive
is what is meant authorities ililter as to the
average internal friction wellington gave
live to eight per cent of indicated power and
forsyth ten per cent it varies with the num-
ber and condition of bearings coupled wheels
valves etc as well as amount of oil used
the old newspaper account of the first trial
of the lion which appeared in the august
issue of the railroad mans magazine in
which it was stated that steam was maintained
at so many pounds although there was no
friction may probably be taken to mean that
the engine had no train behind to detract from
its steaming qualities

hp waycross georgia-our reply to

	 c t v in the august lantern
department relative to increasing the weight
of an air-tank or reservoir by increasing the
pressure of the air within it was simply the
result of an experiment which was performed
with all care that the appliances at hand would
permit theoretically we agree with you and
might have reasoned it out through the usual
well-known formulas as you have done it
was thought better to refer to a practical ex-
periment because we did not believe that in a
tank of the comparatively small size men-
tioned  cubic inches there would be an
appreciable gain in weight and there was none
so far as we could observe in the experiment
which we mentioned lack of sensitiveness in
the weighing appliances at that time may have
a bearing on the result this opinion is held
by a correspondent  j n lincoln nebraska
from whose letter we quote the following

   the result which you obtained in witness-
ing the actual experiment arose from the fact
that the weighing apparatus used was not suffi-
ciently sensitive to record the very slight ad-
ditional weight of the atmosphere necessarily
forced into the tank to create a pressure of
 pounds this additional weight was in-
deed small but it was there and if the weigh-
ing apparatus used had been sufficiently sensi-
tive the additional weight would have been
recorded and obvious

   i have not computed the weight of at-
mosphere that would be involved in raising a
tank of  cubic inches to a pressure of
 or  pounds but it would obviously be an
infinitesimal part of the  square inch  ex-
tending from sea level to the highest altitude
but however limited it would be it would
have weight in exact proportion to the volume
used in creating the named pressure and
would show that weight on a weighing device
sufficiently sensitive to record it

  another correspondent  e v l new
york city whose kind letter is greatly ap-
preciated holds that if the tank were filled
with air at atmospheric pressure and then

heated until the required pressure was ob-
tained the total weight would not be affected
continuing he adds but if the pressure is
obtained by compressing free air then this
would require  cubic inches of free air
as free air at  degrees at the sea level
weighs one pound per  cubic feet this
is equivalent to an addition of  pounds to
the total weight

have selected the various
mills of the united states
steel corporation as the basis
of this article because that
corporation is one of the
largest employers of labor in
the country and because it has made a
special effort to encourage men to sug-
gest plans that could be used for their
safety and has put those plans into
practise

  in the united states steel corporation
however the official organization of the
work of safeguarding employees is com-
paratively recent in its present form it
dates back to march  only although
prior to that date the corporations sub-
sidiary companies working more or less
independently for a long time had taken
steps to prevent accidents by means of
safety devices and instructions to work-
ers a casualty manager being appointed
by each company to supervise the work

  after the work had been in progress
for a year the general solicitor of the
corporation called a meeting of the casu-
alty managers to consider the results of
their work and formulate plans for the
future at the meeting judge elbert 
gary chairman of the board of di-
rectors said

 r r	

   there is not any doubt that our cor-
poration will promptly and fully approve
every suggestion that is made for the
betterment of the safety conditions of our
men provided the recommendations
seem to be practicable i f the only
question involved in them seems to be
that of dollars and cents we will not
hesitate to make the necessary appropri-
ation in money to carry into effect any
suggestion for taking care of our em-
ployees

  the outcome of the meeting vindicated
judge carys utterances a committee
of safety was appointed to inspect the
various plants and works of the subsi-
diary companies and to act as a clearing-
house in obtaining information concern-
ing the safety of the men in its employ

  the committee of safety was instruct-
ed to select inspectors who were to make
written reports  the conditions of the
different plants with reference to the
prevention of accidents these reports
after being passed  by the committee
were transmitted to the proper repre-
sentatives of the companies with a re-
quest that returns might be made within
a period fixed by the committee showing
what action had been taken  the
reports


railroad mans magazine

  the committee got busy it chose as
inspectors men familiar with the ma-
chinery and operations of the various
companies experienced in matters and
conditions connected with accidents and
competent to detect sources of danger
and devise means of overcoming them

all dangers were considered

  each building was considered sep-
arately not only were the larger but
tbe smaller dangers noted w orn floors
carelessly piled material windows that
should be cleaned so as to give better
light and loose planks that invited a fall
were among the lesser dangers noted

  by  the committee had seventy-
eight of the largest subsidiary companies
thoroughly inspected it had received
and considered no less than  recom-
mendations made by the inspectors
more than ninety-two per cent of these
recommendations were accepted and
complied with bv the subsidiary com-
panies less than eight per cent re-
quired additional discussion

  but the inspectors were not alone in
tbe work more than seventy-five sug-
gestions for plans for devices and ap-
pliances for safeguarding machinery
warning employees and otherwise pre-
venting accidents were received inde-
pendently from the companies many
of these suggestions were accompanied
by blue-prints photographs estimates of
cost and other information a majority
of these devices were subsequently used

  as has been said the subsidiary com-
panies acted independently so far as the
actual form and installation of the safety
appliances were concerned accepting the
advice and instruction of the safety
committee

  this committee is now endeavoring to
standardize all safety devices now in use
on machinery common to a majority of
the plants it is tints hoped to insure the
use of only the most effective devices

  phe committee of safety now consists
of charles mcveagh general solicitor of
the united states steel corporation
chairman g m cooper american
bridge company j l chisholm ten-
nessee coal iron anil railroad com-
pany thomas ewing national tube
company l h burnett carnegie steel
company s w tener american steel

oliver iron mining company r i
young illinois steel company and c
l close secretary

  mr close formerly represented tbe
national tube company on the commit-
tee but has been transferred to the serv-
ice of the corporation and attached to
the general solicitors office as manager
of the bureau of safety relief sanitation
and welfare

   here are also safety committees in
almost all the subsidiary companies
these being known as permanent com-
mittees and workmens committees the
first is made up of the superintendent
master mechanics and heads of depart-
ments the second consists of three mem-
bers of the rank and tile the second
committee is allowed time once or twice
a month or in some cases once a week
to make a thorough inspection of the
plant during which the members are
paid their usual rate of wages

  the duty of both committees is to look
for defects in buildings or equipment
unsafe practises of workmen and any
other condition of men or machinery
that might cause accident

  the make-up of the workmens com-
mittee is changed frequently so as to give
a majority of the employees a chance to
improve conditions it is understood
however that when they cease to be
committeemen they shall not allow their
interest in tbe safety movement to cease
also consequently a goodly proportion
of practical suggestions come from
former members of the committee

 suggestion box  for men

  the committees also investigate seri-
ous accidents examine witnesses report
 negligence and suggest tbe punish-
ment

  one of the unique features of the
safety movement is tbe  suggestion
box  that is placed outside the entrance
to all the plants into these boxes the
men drop written hints or plans for
adding to the safety equipment if any
are found to be practical the man ma-
king the suggestion is paid

  money talks in this safety scheme just
as it does in all business affairs since
 over  has been expended
for safety by the corporation since
saving the worker



iyi i  lias been spent the
results have warranted the disbursement
in  there were forty-three per cent
less accidents than in  and the in-
dications are that the current year will
produce a better showing

it must be remembered that the num-
ber of employees is increasing annually

so that forty-three percent really doesnt
represent the present situation to-day
there are about  workmen  the
pay-roll of the corporation

  apart from the safety devices for ma-
chinery the workers are surrounded
with sanitary precautions of an elaborate
nature there are spacious baths ven-
tilating devices change houses for
the street clothing of the men during
working hours and in which they can
wash up when the days labor is over
hospitals with corps of trained nurses a
staff of doctors and a full equipment of
operating reception and examination
rooms and dormitories

  so many suggestions for safety de-
vices have been received by the corpora-

tion that it has not been easy to make a
selection there are thousands of these
devices covering every conceivable phase
of danger many of them being remark-
able combinations of ingenuity and sim-
plicity

  indeed some of the most effective are
among the simplest

   l iie first thing to be put in use was a
danger  trade-mark this is a red
ball time was when danger points were
protected by written warnings in several
languages including those of the slavic
nations but it was found that many
foreign workmen were illiterate and the
warnings were useless

universal danger signal

  the red ball was adopted as a signifi-
cant and permanent sign of danger and
it has worked admirably not only is it
used in this country but it has been sug-
gested for use abroad in the hope that
the crimson sphere may become general-
ly recognized as a signal of warning

a-roundhouse derailing switch before reaching this switch an engine must stop and
fireman must hoid the switch closed for engine to pass without this device an
engine or train not under control might run into the turntable pit
railroad maxs magazine

throughout the manufacturing districts
cf both europe and america

  an amusing instance of this fact was
recently noted in austria an american
purchased several boxes of matches on
which war- the red ball with the state-
ment that there was no danger in pur-
chasing that particular brand of matches

  wherever it is necessary to expose a
live wire in the steel plants a sign is
hung under the wire on which in vivid
red is pictured joves hand holding a
sheaf of thunderbolts below the hand
is the word  elektrika and beneath
that a skull and cross-bones

  xo matter how unlettered an employee
may be this sign is sufficiently signifi-
cant and its grim hint is understood so

track target for night and day service
a-track disk painted red with outer
ring of white p-clamp for se-
curing target to rail f-
padlock on lantern to
prevent removal

well is its meaning understood that on
one occasion the applicants for employ-
ment at one of the plants carefully kept
away from an iron hand-rail in front of
the window of the employment bureau

  an investigation showed that one of
the clerks had placed an  elektrika 
sign in the window above the rail to keep
the sunshine from his desk

  there are many lettered signs displaw 
outside and inside the various plants that
play their part in the reduction of acci-
dents  h er the gates of certain works
is the sign

   sai-et  it pays you to think before you act

  this illuminated sign is affixed to an-
other gate-post

   the prevention of accidents and injuries by
all possible means is a personal duty which
everyone owes not only to himself alone
but also to his fellow workmen

  in other instances you are reminded

   the careful workman is the efficient workman

   lie who prevents an accident has done a good
djys work

  the change is rung on the same sub-
ject in hundreds of different ways

  apart from the red ball every plant
is supplied with enameled steel signs on
which in flaring red is inscribed a
danger warning in half a dozen
languages a typical sign of this kind
reads as follows

  danger  you are warned against working
without eye-protectors or with battered tools
get proper tools and eye-sliields from foreman

  the same sentence is repeated in the
other languages some foreign words for
 danger  being  vebespecono  ves-
sel y  opansno and  nicbespecsens-
wq

  a sign that plays a prominent part in
the safety scheme tops a light metal
stand it reads

  danger  workmen overhead 

  it is so constructed that when not in
use the wording of the sign drops out
of sight

  when a man enters a boiler to clean
or repair it he slips over the valve-wheel

which is locked on by a padlock owned
by the man the padlock has a metal
tag on its red background on which is
painted in large letters

  all boilers are numbered at the front
and rear and the crown-valve is num-
bered correspondingly this prevents
any one locking or operating the valves

  the railroad safety devices are many
there is a roundhouse derailing-switch
by which a locomotive must be stopped
before it reaches the switch which the
fireman holds closed while the engine
passes without the switch the ma-
chine might run wild

simple and effective devices

  when blasting near a railroad track is
necessary there is always a possibility
that a spark from a locomotive or a
steam-shovel may cause a premature ex-
plosion so a shield has been devised
which precludes all possibility of acci-
dent this shield entirely covers the can
of explosive

  sometimes a train has to use tracks
that run through mills where the clamor
of machinery is deafening in such
cases the bells of the engine are located
close to the rails so that their warning
notes are rendered much more distinct
than if a bell was in its usual position on
the top of the boiler

  where cars are stalled accidentally or
purposely an ingenious track target is
used it has a clutch that grips the rail
in front of a car at its upper end is a
disk that shows red by day and a red
light by night it is as easy to handle
as it is effective

  there are several good rubber devices
to prevent a man from getting his foot
jammed in the frog of a switch

  a track  skidder  with target attach-
ment is also used as a temporary bump-
ing-block it is extremely simple so far
as its details are concerned but very
effective

  the flat cars that transport open-
hearth charging-boxes from place to
place are equipped with end boards to
prevent the boxes or their contents from
falling over the end of the car onto the

rails in addition the cars are fitted
with steps grab-irons and operating
levers all intended to increase safety

  all the switching-engines are fitted
with steps forward to prevent the
dangerous practise of swinging upon the
pilot when the engine is in motion since
the introduction of these steps coupling
accidents have shown a material de-
crease

  a car-shifter with a steel heel that
 bites  the rail with practically no slip
is in general use in the yards about
fourteen inches from the upper end of
the handle a steel disk is welded in
case the bar should slip or turn and the
man be thrown forward this disk pro-
vides a stop that prevents injury to his
hands

  there is a trestle in the carnegie
works the equipment of which is char-

hell ilacel close to track so as to be

acteristic of the efforts being made to
protect the workers

  there is a foot-walk on both sides of
the trestle provided with a standarj
hand-rail and toe-board  n the stand-
pipe ladder is an expanded metal shield to
prevent the men from touching the high-
tension wires

  across the track is suspended the
 telltale  to warn trainmen that then i-
no  top clearance  at the entrance of
the boiler-house metal shields stay em-
ployees from climbing down the high-
tension poles from the trestle foot-walk
 n all these poles are painted in red the
words

  danger live wires  volts keep
off

  there is also a white box around the
guy wires to prevent men from being in-
jured at night should tlrey come in con-
tact with the wires

  must protect men from themselves

  inside the mills are the carpeuter-
shops but the rip-saws are giving out a
subdued hum instead of their usual noisy
buzz

  each saw is metal-jacketed with just
enough open space below to insert the
wood on which it is to  chew no
whirling menace of angry teeth a baby
might safely play with the humming
tiling

  all belt-pullcys are encased in metal
netting and there are automatic devices
for shifting the belting the days of
arms being lopped off by the toothed disk
have passed

  here is a tempering tank the water
it contains is still steaming from the last
immersion of hot metal but a metal
hood shuts over it in the center of which
is cut a narrow aperture through which
can be thrust small articles the whole
hood can be turned back so as to leave
the entire surface of the tank available

  this hood prevents a careless worker
from stepping into the hot liquid

  no small proportion of the work of
safety committees is to protect the men
from themselves most of the safety
devices must be automatic if their
operation were left to the employees the
results would be the reverse of satis-
factory this statement is made on the

authority of men who are constanth
engaged in safety problems

  lie feature of the machinery shops
that strikes a v isitor is the apparent ab-
sence of wheels and belting in the pat-
tern-shops of the ensley works not a
wheel of all the massive machinerv is
visible although tbe air is filled with
their roar and rumble

  solid metal shields are built over gears
pulleys and belt-driven planers they
give no outward indication of the tre-
mendous machinery they imprison you
may lean against or loiter among whir-
ring wheels and spinning belts with just
as much safety as if you were lounging
at home

  enter the carnegie steel companys
works and study the steel-wheel roll-
gears which have had the guards re-
moved to furnish a good view of the
concealed machinery the massive sys-
tem of wheels and piston-rods thus re-
vealed is appalling when one thinks of
the accidents they might be responsible
for now the guards are put in place
and lo one could take a nap where a
moment before he was in danger of being
turned to mince-meat

  the big emery-wheels in many of the
plants and which usually run at 
feet rim speed are fitted with safety
collars in the event of centrifugal force
causing the bursting of the wheel - a
not uncommon happening-the frag-
ments are held together by the collar
instead of scattering disaster

caging the dangerous cogs

  the hand-jib crane-gears from which
the guards have been removed show
an array of grim cogged men-manglers
that gleam menacingly as they swiftly
revolve now the guards stout metal
boxes are replaced and there isnt even
a visible suggestion of the hidden
danger

  the small shop lathes are collections of
bristling projecting wheels belts and
points so arranged it would seem to
catch and crush the unwary before be-
ing put into use they are transformed
from potential hospital fillers to harm-
less machines

plates covering their cellars so as to pre-
vent injury to workers high-speed
 chucks rubber mixing rolls saw-
guards of many designs die-grinders
and other danger-dealing devices are all
covered to save life and lessen accidents

  in some instances mostly in the
lighter machinery the solid metal guards
are replaced by those of metal netting
the reed lathes are good illustrations
their gearing and belting are enclosed in
 cages

  here are the gigantic heating fur-
naces in front of each long rows of
sprocket wheels and their chains turn
ceaselessly in other days both were

unguarded old workmen tell grizzly
stories of victims being caught and
chewed to death by the pinions on the
sprockets to-day such ghastly happen-
ings are altogether impossible as guards
encase the revolving machinery

  in the mines of the corporation are to
be found a multiplicity of devices for
protecting life and property if the
cables of the lifts or cages should break
safety  dogs  are immediately released
they fly out and engage clutches on
either side of the cage arresting the fall

  when a car of ore is wheeled into the
cage automatic  chocks  rise from the
flooring and hold it firmly in place as

guards in frogs to prevent a man getting his foot caught these
guards a are made out of skelp steel cut bent and se-
corely fastened into place c - safety railroad

the cage begins to move high doors at
either end automatically close

  special provision is made to protect
cranemen a safety chamber forms part
of each crane it is built of steel lined
with asbestos and has a concrete lloor
its door swings easily and closes auto-
matically

  in case of trouble the craneman can
take refuge inside and escape lire and
poisonous gases the chamber is venti-
lated by means of a pipe leading through
its roof it has a small mica window and
an arrangement by which the occupant
may operate the crane

  in cases in which electricity is the
motive-power of a machine a safety rope
is attached to the electric switch pulling
this rope shuts off the  juice  and stops
the machinery

  the locomotives used in connection
with lifting or wrecking cranes are fitted
with a device that gives instant warning
when the weight on the crane threatens
to topple over both crane and engine

  the apparatus consists of a u-siaped

tube the ends of which arc closed by
rubber stops through which pass steel
points that arc connected with an electric
bell at the lower part of the tube two
other steel points enter it these in turn
being wired with the bell

   he tube contains mercury which
scarcely touches the steel needles if the
engine begins to tilt no matter how
slightly the mercury follows the move-
ment connects with one of the points
closes the circuit and sets the bell going
the engineer has sufficient time to avert
the threatened danger

  a limit-switch for electric overhead
traveling cranes prevents  running the
blocks in which event the cable would
break and the load spill on the work-
men after the switch has stopped the
hoist the load can be lowered without
readjustment of the switch

when handling hot metal

  an ingenious push shifter is used
for tight and loose pulleys making it
impossible for the belt to work from the
one to the other and start a machine un-
expectedly many accidents were due to
 wandering  belts prior to the introduc-
tion of the shifter

  w hat is known as the patton safety
dev ice is in general use in the smelting
works the intention of the device is
to prevent the lowering of the boom of
a hot metal-ladle below the pouring posi-
tion thereby avoiding the possibility of
the ladle coming in contact with the
molds either by absence of power or care-
lessness of the operator

  the old plan of taking by hand
ground material from a revolving nuiller
or mixing pan while the pan was in mo-
tion led to a number of bad accidents

  a modern safety device for this work
consists of a hinged gate when not in
use this gate rests on the outer edge of
pan when however it is necessary to
 trough  the wet material the gate is
forced inward by means of a hand-wheel
and screw forming an angle across the
path of the material it forces the latter
out of the gap in the rim into the wheel-
barrow below

nection with bins and hoppers to prevent
men falling into the coal and limestone

track skiddek with target attachment this device gives the same
warning as an ordinary target and actually stops a
moving car within four feet running at a
speed of about six miles an hour

  in the wire-working works a simple
hut effective arrangement prevents in-
jury to workmen who are accidentally
caught on the blocks the wire is passed
through a hoop in the head of a safety-
lever so that a snarl will throw the lever
over and stop the block

  a safety rope is attached to the lever
carried above the frame and down the
side of the block if a workman should
be caught  the block a pull on the
rope will stop the machine

  that useful vehicle the wheelbarrow
is found in large numbers in most of the
mills and plants the barrowmen often
have to enter narrow passages or pass
other barrows in both instances there
is danger of scraped knuckles and broken
lingers to prevent such troubles
rounded metal guards are slipped over
the upper and outer parts of the handles

  where rods of metal hot or otherwise
are being handled large oval-shaped
pieces of leather are slipped over the
palms of the hands these are kept in
place by a broad thong at the back of
the leathers but if one of the leathers
should happen to get caught in the gear-
ing or belting the instant freeing of the

hand from the thong might be a matter 
of great difficulty

  to obviate such accidents the thongs
are attached to the leather guards by
spiral springs strong enough to keep the
hands in place but able to free them if
given a vigorous tug

  the sides of beams and floors through
which elevators travel are beveled and
sheeted with metal to prevent a mans
feet from being shearedoff by the ele-
vators

  a safety car-wrench invented by an
employee of the larain works is in gen-
eral use it is designed for the dis-
charging of the contents of drop-bottom
cars and is constructed with a hinged
joint

  if the shaft of the wrench starts to re-
volve on account of the pull of the drop-
ping door the hinged portion flies
around and without pulling releases the
handle from the users hands without
giving him a jolt the handle is offset
so that a mans hands will not strike the
car during the operation while the
hinged head is double in order that it
may be used  winding shafts that turn
either to the right or the left

  this wrench will fit several sizes of
square shafts its use does away with
many accidents due to the ordinary
wrench

  many grinding and finishing opera-
tions create such showers of steel chips
that the workmen are required to wear

  a clever but simple safety hook for
hoisting-cranes is in generaluse this
hook is to prevent the rope or chain that
is passed over a hoisting-crane from
being brushed off or from slipping off
it is in two parts the lower being an
ordinary hook while the upper working
on a hinge meets and fits over the nose
of the former

  after the chain is put in place over
the hook the hinged section closes over
the nose and is locked thereon by means
of a sliding square band that comes
down from over the shank of the hook
and the hinge unless this band is re-
moved by hand it is impossible to open
the hook

telephone that terminates in a pointed
wire if a suspected spoke should be
struck with a hammer at the same time

cracked will yield a dead sound that is
instantly recognized by the expert

  the detector is also used for determin-
ing the condition of those parts of a

boat-shaped
train failed
as flier

by petek clay

a dream of a thousand miles an
hour caused one of the most dis-
appointing failures of railroad
history in  when frederick lp-
hani adams the novelist was a reporter
 a chicago newspaper lie was as-
signed to interview a certain mr mc-
fadden who had lunged at tlie lime-
light by claiming that by the use of a
driving-wheel sixteen feet in diameter
an engine could run from ew york
to chicago in less than an hour or ap-
proximately at a speed of sixteen miles
a minute mcfadden talked very con-
vincingly to adams and the reporter
was so impressed that he studied mc-
faddens theory it seemed to adams
that if an engine with such drivers
might run at an egregious speed at-
mospheric resistance would retard it
very much this was adamss principal
objection to mcfaddens arguments

air pressure an obstacle

  three years later while traveling 
the denver and kio grande the matter
of atmospheric pressure was brought
vividly before mr adams while stand-
ing on the platform of one of the cars
he soon afterward plunged into sci -
tific study of the subject and by 
had prepared a treatise on the subject
which was seriously received by a
prominent western publisher and is-
sued in book form in that year adamss
book  atmospheric resistance and its
relation to the speed of railway
trains was a volume of about ninety
pages elaborately illustrated with draw-
ings and charts

  in his work he argued that pressure
of the air was the principal obstacle to
high speed of trains and that it would
be useless for inventors or mechanical
engineers to experiment with new de-
vices to increase velocity until they had
solved the problem of atmospheric re-
sistance lie proposed as a remedy his
invention in his introduction lie said
the front of my locomotive is
modeled like the prow of a boat from

i

the famous boat-shaped train of frederick upham adams in the mount clare yards in baltimore mr adams invented this train to
minimize atmospheric pressure and increase the jspeed of ordinary engines to one hundred and fifty miles an hour

the front end the tender shades back to meet
tile lines of the first ear automatic hoods
close the space between when a train is
made up it stretches away from the tender
as if it was one car my invention contem-
plates a train built as nearly as possible on
the lines of an ocean steamer

  adams thought that a train of such con-
struction would travel one hundred or one
hundred and fifty miles an hour without
the employment of an engine of excessive
tractive-power or steam-pressure though
less than twenty years ago his theory en-
gaged the serious attention of railroad men
and in  the baltimore and ohio put
such a train into service it proved to be
efficient but did not attain the predicted
velocity and was finally abandoned it of-
fered  advantages over the ordinary

equipment and cost much more when it
was proposed it was received with utmost
credulity by the public and adamss disap-
pointment at its failure was very bitter
atmospheric pressure lias not since been
seriously considered in train-movement

 frederick upham adams  grizzly
adams as he is familiarly known was horn
in boston in  his boat-shaped train
was his first anil only experiment in rail-
roading ii cost him just  to equip
the train and try out the idea that was
his fortune and he saw it vanish in thin
air as the train failed to make better time
than the ordinary expresses

  since then mr adams has written many
successful novels me is shown in the ac-
companying picture standing at the cylinder-
head

it hadnt been busted

the operator sprinted down the track after the train while loquacious
sam calmly dusted off the order

by third trick

this happened at wewoka indian ter-
ritory  the old choctaw road now
the property of the rock island sys-
tem at the time twelve hours was con-
sidered a short days work for a railroad
operator i held the day job while wilson
took what hay there might be on the night
stunt it was his custom to come to break-
fast about  in order to talk a little shop
with me during the morning meal he was
a good operator but careless at times

  on the morning in question he came to
breakfast as usual but announced to auntie
lou the corpulent colored waitress and
boss of the kitchen that shed have to show
some speed as he had to get back to the
depot for a train

  outside of her own excellent  con pone
the most important proposition in the world
to auntie was a railroad train the request
to hurry mr telegrafters rations to
facilitate the movement of so wonderful a
phenomenon threw her into such a state
of bustling activity that she nearly upset
the adjoining table and hail an all-around
and loud-voiced altercation with the rest of
the colored help in the kitchen

  we both laughed so heartily at this that
perhaps it took the kids mind off the situa-
tion when he left the depot

  we both reached the depot about 
a few minutes later the train showed up
s the engineer whistled for the board
wilson stepped to the telegraph table

   thought i had an order for that fellow
he said  but guess it was busted  yes
it was busted all right and he gave the
extra freight a clear board while the train
passed he stood at the window and  could
see lie was thinking hard but he was  the
job and i did not consider it professional
etiquette to butt in

  as the caboose passed sam our lengthy
and loquacious colored porter came in to
finish the job of dusting which lie usually
straggled along into three hours work

  there were only two pigeonholes for
blank order books and they were usually
pretty well filled every morning sam
dusted each book very carefully about a
dozen times as it was early in the day he
began on the books

 sam always told stories while he
worked even if  one listened to him
and on this particular occasion he care-
fully drew forth one of the books from the
 order rack while in the midst of a yarn

  lie had just begun to tickle it gently with
the feather duster when he suddenly stopped
in his narrative and exclaimed
when the train broke in three



   massa wilson hyars one of deni odali
books wid writin on it  niusta put dat
one in hyar by mistake dis mawnin

  wilson wheeled upon him wrathfully

   well dont dust the writing off it lets
see it

  glancing at it only long enough to as-
certain that it was the order which  hadnt
been busted he slammed the wondering
sam on the side of the head with it sev-
eral times and made for the door

  when lie struck the track he hit the trail
of that train now a mile and a half away
all the while flopping both arms up and
down like a scared hen in the hope that
some of the crew would see the signal

   lawdy   muttered sam  dat boy has
sure gone crazy

  the trains rubbed noses about four miles
from w ewoka as they backed into the
town they found w ilson  the right-of-
way still reading the order

some twenty years ag-  engineer sttir-
tivant of the maine central was haul-
ing night freight between w arerviile
and bangor with old engine 

  had this old machine not been a flier his
adventure would have turned out much dif-
ferently from llermi n center to hanger
is about seven miles a  down grade as
you enter the west yard at bangor you
swing round high head curve and  ntoihe
banks of the penobscot phis curve is
sharp and high above the river the west
yard is about a mile long down grade an i
the lower half is cn a curve

  on the inside of this curve was the freight
yard cars were lined up al ng the main
track and a man could see only a few feet
several switchers were always at work
around the curve and at the foot  f the
grade was the passenger station

  beyond the train-shed you rounded a
curve and entered exchange street station
crossing a drawbridge just before entering

  between exchange street static  and
penobscot switch half a mile east was the
eastern yard then came the up-grade

  this single track between penobscot
switch and bangor station was then the
most used single track in maine

  it was just growing light as engineer
sturtivant glanced back near hermou cen-
ter to see if they  were all coming whn
to his dismay he discovered that his train
hail broken into three sections the middle
section was close behind with no brakeman
aboard

  before sturtivant was a steep grade it
was up to him to hustle and give the runa-
ways plenty of room

  opening the old  she responded nobly
and was soon rolling them better than a
mile a minute but the heavy middle sec-
tion was keeping pace with him

  the  was doing all she could when

sturtivant ncand the bangor yards he was
gcing cciisherably in excess of sixty miles
an   t komii the curve they swept with
the engine wide rpen the whistle was
lied own to warn tiie switchers

  through the yard went sturtivant he
was ii imminent anger of colliding with a
switcher th- also there was the danger
of an open switch and the added horror of
jumping the track  that curve

  his drivers wre only a blur people near
the tracks made haste to get away on
round the curve out onto the street he went
engine still wide open and the runaways
ere wiling him closely

  sturtivant realized the danger of a col-
lision with another train fie had gone
past his terminal and had  rights  this
piece of track

  suddenly all thoughts of collision with
another train must have gone out of his
mind for as he opened out  the straight
track toward the drawbridge he saw that
it was open to let a schooner pass

  in a few seconds he would make the
bridge so he quietly- got down into the gang-
way to jump clear when the old  should
plunge into the stream

  he was going a good seventy miles an
hour and the remaining distance was short

  the bridge-tender was the man for the
emergency however no sooner were the
schooner s masts clear than he began to
swing the draw faster than it ever went
before did it get there just by a hair

  there wasnt five seconds to spare old
s trucks hit the rails safely as the
schooners stern passed under the bridge

 through exchange street station
through the east yard they thundered-by
penobscot switch and onto the up-grade

  up the grade they flew until the runa-
way s had lost their momentum then stur-
tivant safely brought the head end to a stop

the big brown buckle

     by robert fulkerson hoffman
     the greatest of blind perils against which
     no expert skill of railroad men can insure

ell challenged mut-
ton  while youre talk-
ing of chances whats
the worst chance a man
goes against in this busi-
ness 

  if you engine people had to name the
topnotcher of em all what would you
say huh

   i aint engine people exactly vol-
unteered sands the conductor  but
youve sure got to say fog if you want
to get it right fog and a tired or re-
tired  flag 

   theres more people than the  flag 
that dont get far from the rear end in
a fog countered mutton but what
about a landslide or a chunk of rail gone
out of the main line what chance has
a man got against them 

   lots of chances declared sunny
acre  youve got to say a busted boiler
while youre firing if you want my vote
once in a thousand mebbe theyll search
a fellow out of the corn-field and find lies
able to tend the hearing that comes after
rut what kind of a chance is that 

   its a chance to say he didnt burn
the crown-sheet aint it demanded
mutton with the grin that bears so many
railroad ills

  yes its that agreed sunny and
for all the good it does him he might as
well stayed in the corn mightnt he
huh if shes cracked open full length
 the back same as a hatchcd-out locust
why he burned the crown-sheet with
low water anyway never was a boiler
known to go up any other way by the
record

   what do you say jim  he appealed
to mahalie  aint a working boiler the
big chance 

  mahalies fingers for a moment ceased
their leisurely movement and his eyes
turned with a certain anxiety toward his
waiting engine a little sputtering leak
at the throat-sheet was sending up a lazy
wisp of steam and mahalie hated leaks
the thing had been bothering him in a
subconscious sort of way for several days
while he ran

  repeated reports and ordinary tinker-
ing had failed to entirely stop the ap-
parently insignificant leak and now
came sunny acre with his offhand dis-
course on bursting boilers to make ma-
halie fully aware that he had really been
worried over it worried more than he
had realized among the many bigger
chances and worried more than he now
was willing to admit vet deeper he
stifled a sterner dread

  so he merely hitched himself a little
further back on the empty baggage-tritck
to dear his feet from the drip drip of
rain from the low-hanging eaves of the
little villa rica station where they sat
waiting and his steady fingers resumed
their placid task of untwining a thread
of gray from a thread of white in the
wisp of cotton waste on his knees

  ceasing this abruptly he glanced at
his watch then up to the notch of the
pass high-above the rise of the tracks

   way over the mountains yonder
and out beyond the tehachapies he said
slowly  theres a state where they give
a man the choice of being hanged or be-
ing shot if lies deserving it


railroad mans magazine

   now if you fellows were choosing
which would you take

   aw come off jim urged sunny
 dont side-step it that way play the
game aint it boilers

  mahalie waved him off with a smile
and moved toward the engine standing
rain-streaked and gently sputtering

   up there comes our game sunny
he said as the mellow whistle-notes of
the oncoming limited rolled down dis-
tantly from the notch of the pass
 well play it the same as usual like as
not

   like as not agreed sands picking
up his well-worn conductors bag  but
dont any of you forget that well be
chasing fast freight and more fast
freight will lie chasing us till we get
onto double track beyond the soledad
valiev drizzle up here fog down
yonder till the sun cuts in

   tell hutton laughed sunny mov-
ing close away after mahalie  hut-
tons your fog artist at the rear jim and
me for it at the front

   theyll all hit torpedoes and red be-
fore any of them get into a hind end that
im flagging said hutton  keep your
eye on the gun ahead sunny and well
go through

   thats what they all say tossed
back the fireman as he strode confidently
to the engine

  the limited glided masterfully to its
stop disgorged its hungry throng of
drowsy breakfast-seekers cut off its
throbbing engine and laid silent and
glistening in the rain as though some
deep-water marvel had fled vagrant into
the high country and fallen suddenly be-
headed

  under the rare leaden sky of the
mountains the roundhouse across the
way sat sullenly and impassively as a
great gun-turret on that upper deck of
the mountain strongholds methodically
ceaselessly yet silently launching its huge
projectiles of train far out over the ser-
ried ranks of the mountains and toward
the western sea

  into the face of the mere seeming out-
wardness of that great game which is
played not so much by written book or
rule as by the unspoken rule of the in-
stants need the great unceasing deadly
game of the railroad with its unwritten
and secret rule invisibly graven upon the

swift-fleeting walls of the valley of de-
cision wherein he who runs must quickly
and unfailingly read into the face of this
the little group of changing crew had
tossed their mites of hardy jest against
the changing specter of aii ever-present
dread

  as the best of their kind have ever
done as the best of their kind will ever
do they made their dauntless bluff
against the unknown and presentlv had
gone their way the way of limited and
freight into the fastnesses of the farther
mountains

  in that vast upper rifle-range lying
broadly between the great rivers and the
western sea where the play of cannon-
balls of commerce is fiercest and the
battle never wanes mahalies roaring
projectile of engine and train once swift-
ly launched from the sullen turret of
villa rica went darting bounding rico-
cheting from ridge to ridge from peak
to peak

  insensibly it became one of many
giant shuttles  the mountains crowded
single track that day weaving their fleet-
ing figures into the everlasting tapestry
of the high country patterning from it
anew extending drawing closer the
broad mantle of commerce round about a
teeming world

  from the sputtering leak at the throat-
sheet of mahalies engine while nerves
were tense with swift action and the pres-
sure of battle within and battle without
was greatest the insistent waft of steam
came up gustily against his face at the
cab-window now and then

  for the instant his close-lidded eyes
would fall anxiously toward the under
curve of the straining boiler but  touch
of his could forefend against whatever
of pressing menace lay hidden there 
touch of his hand upon the engine no
word to the laboring acre at the fire
dared lessen a pressure or lessen a
chance

  it was not in the game they were
playing the game as usual

  as to that they had their reward no
bursting roar of steel and steam no
rending death and cruel after-farce of
 putting the brownies  the dead man
was theirs

  the sputtering throat-sheet went val-
iantly whiskingup among the lonely pinoii
clusters of the hitherto silent mountain-
the big brown buckle



sides down across the barren gullies and
arroyos whirling roaring past the jut-
ting crags of red and green and umber of
the crooked canon of the soledad where
fog lay thick and impenetrable even to
the canons ragged upper lip and the
river sent up its purling voice unheard
in the white silence shattered by the en-
gines sounding cannonade

  somewhere hidden in the folds of
that white veil the specter of that great
dread which sands had rated dread of
dreads lurked unavailingly no crash
of torpedoes nor flash of red nor de-
spairing cry of defeated flagman heralded
the plunge of death and flying debris
which is the too frequent haunting night-
mare of men who follow the rail it was
not in the game that day

  out of the level bank of fog and out
of the yawning mouth of the canon ma-
halies engine shot safely with the limited
curling true in its wake

  with increasing roar as of a greater
sureness with the disturbing leak sim-
mering harmlessly as a purring kettle
warming at a domestic hearth with the
fog of the canon settling safely to the
rear upon its hidden chance the limited
took the big rise to soledad flats and shot
over the crest into the broad smile of the
rising sun

  in that clear height the little block-sta-
tion hovered at the end of double track
stretching away like curving sword-
blades glinting in the smiling sun upon
that narrow table-iand stretched miles of
easy gathering for the limiteds hungry
schedule at mahalies deep insistent
whistle-call the semaphore-arm held for
a moment extended motionless as
though in huge and silent benediction

  then it fell swiftly and sure the
way was clear under that smiling sky

  without pause he went speeding
curving out upon the big crescent the
track upon which he ran the outer track
of two was his beyond cavil or dispute

  no light was ever fairer no track
more firm and true yet his hand went
furtively testing from throttle-latch to
brake-valve and back to throttle-latch
while he scanned with eager watchful-
ness the rushing track ahead within
him was rising that ultimate fear which
he would not give up to sunny acres
questioning which he had never yet
shaped into words for himself

     r r

  while the limiteds speed mounted
fearlessly under his steady hand from
forty fifty sixty up to seventy-mile gait
and more he sat outwardly unmoved
making time amends for the slower pace
out of the canon then with the four-
fold line of gleaming steel reeling under
and past him came the embodiment of
his secret dread

  far ahead where the blue of the sky
met the green of the pinons on the rim
of the seemingly endless curve a jutting
clot of black pressed newly on his sight
to his trained sight it quickly resolved
into a hurrying dot of freight-engine
laboring under a pall of smoke flung low
upon the broad face of the mountain

  each moment of his own breathless
flight drove him many lengths toward the
freights rushing advance upon the inner
track each moment in the later few
set out more clearly to his view the long
and even line of red-brown box cars
curving across the table-land to meet and
pass him at a combined speed that reck-
oned with no obstruction

  swiftly the narrowing span between
the rushing engines was closing tense-
ly he sat quelling his one great fear test-
ing vital latching of levers but lessening
not in the least his speed

  in the cab of the freight-engine sat
another man as inwardly filled with
subtle dread as calm as watchful slack-
ening none of his rushing advance be-
cause slackening is not in that stage of
the great game and the game must be
played by the unwritten rule

  while yet there remained a brief span
of the open between them mahalie saw
far back along the curving line of red-
brown cars a sudden staggering uplift
and subsiding of their level decks

  briefly he saw it lift heavily come
plunging on and fall again in the hur-
rying line unconsciously his hand flitted
from throttle-lever to brake-valve then
back to throttle-lever and moved neither
the one nor the other

  speeding breathlessly he was passing
through the deadly valley of decision
facing that sudden rising of the blind
peril against which there is  real as-
surance of skill he had decided

  hesaw the big brown buckle of freight-
train broken in two by its own  internal
pressure disrupted by its own quick-
setting brakes heaving staggering top-


railroad mans magazine

pling perilously along the line of his own
hurrying way

  he heard the pilot-beam of his engine
strike and shear through a vagrant over-
hanging end of debris and toss it like
chaff back upon the toppling menace on
the inner track

  he sat firm in his quick decision to do
nothing while his engine sped swiftly
past the steadier rearward end of freight
and felt the lurching grind of splintered
wood ripping harmlessly along the glis-
tening steel sides of the limited where
only paints and jealously coddled var-
nishes were suffering by the rude impact

  then she steadied and sped on while
he caught the flash of the stock-still way-
car of the freight safely passed to his
rear with the clutter of wreck only
then lie shoved the throttle-lever close
home and set the air of his train as
steadily as though the run were fully
ended

   all over for this time sunny he
said as the big engine ground steadily
to its stop  what can you see from
your side hurrv

  acre leaped from his crouching behind
the boiler-head to a clear view rearward

   caboose and the back half all right
i guess said acre clenching the wind-
dow-ledge in his concentrated stare
 shes a holy fright about the middle
buckled out over both tracks for about
ten cars worth is what it looks like

   say ten more ticks  the watch
would a fixed s for the big day jim
dje know that just about ten more
ticks and wed a piled that up right
howd you guess us through that jim 
wheres sands see anything of
him queried mahalie anxiously as he
wedged himself beside acre at the win-
dow  say sunny run back and ask
him whether hes got anybody for the
hospital to come off the freight or any-
thing missing along the side of s to
hold us here we cant stay here for
nothing you know hurry will you
we cant both go

  he stretched higher in his effort for

clearer sight across the line of curvature
and when his eyes settled back from that
riven mass upon the curve to fall upon
sunny acres sturdy figure running and
shouting lustily to hurrying sands ma-
halie allowed one sickening thrill of un-
derstanding of what might have been to
shake him for an instant to the core

  that much of tribute he paid grudg-
ingly to the thing which he had always
feared to meet and now had met then
he came back solidly to the reassuring
group that came running toward the
engine

  he climbed down hastily to examine
the minor damage to his pilot parts
there hutton sands and acre gathered
hurriedly around him with eager ques-
tion and quick reply

   can you go jim can you go  de-
manded sands

  yes ready rejoined mahalie

   nothing here for us said sands
 but thats sure one of them back
yonder how ever did you miss it jim
you couldnt do that again in a million

   get aboard you fellows said ma-
halie as he finished his search for dam-
aged air-fixtures for weve sure got to
get out of this

  how did i miss it he repeated
over his shoulder while mounting the

the incomplete message

round him were all the evi-
  dences of a hasty de-
  parture closet doors
  stood half open and the

v contents of bureaus and

  dressers were scattered
about usually the epitome of neatness
beatrice had evidently wasted no time in
putting things to rights before starting on
her errand of mercy to run into dangers
of which he shuddered to think

  a hasty search of the open desk dis-
closed nothing but on the table lay a torn
telegram heyward seized upon it eager-
ly the upper half was gone but the
remainder contained the information
which he sought

 vernet no
 hurry

marquette street
fiavia

  where was the rest of the message
he looked in the waste-paper basket on
the floor under the couch in every pos-
sible and impossible spot but could find
 trace of it and meanwhile the pre-
cious moments were flying it was no
use he must do with such information
as he possessed hurriedly he closed
and locked the door and returning to the
office left the key with the clerk with a
word of thanks for the latters courtesy

an hour later he was rushing west-
ward cursing the slowness of the train
with every revolution of the flying
began in the june railroad mans ma

  wheels never had the journey to the
  windy city seemed so long the night
  seemed interminable heyward tossed
  feverishly  his berth sleep was im-
  possible a thousand hideous fancies
  thronged his brain beatrice was in
  danger and he the man who professed
  to put her well-being above everything
  else had gone a-pleasuring leaving her
   clue to his whereabouts should she
  have need of him to be sure bartlett
  was with her but even bartlett would
  prove of little assistance in an encounter
  with the arch-villain bult and the sharp
  wits of flavia graham

    at last worn out and desperate hey-
  ward rose and made his way to the smo-
  king-car it was deserted at that hour
  but a newspaper lying  one of the
  chairs attracted his attention he picked
  it up and unfolded it as he lighted a ciga-
  rette and ran his eye over the columns
  then he stopped appalled his cigarette
  dropped to the floor as he read in glar-
  ing head-lines

    the beautiful miss berkeley and dr

bartlett flee together to chicago

   the type blurred before heywards
 eyes the paper sagged from his hand

    it had come the scandal the hate-
  ful publicity the yellow-journal sensa-
  tion  beatrice had been seen on the
  train with bartlett and the fertile imagi-
  nation of the reporter had done the rest
  her name would be blazoned in letters

would be ridiculed laughed at villified
by millions of sensation-seekers and
scandalmongers

  and il was all his fault he reflected
with a burst of self-condemnation why
had he not stayed at home to protect the
girl he loved when she most needed his
protection why had not something
warned him that she would require his
aid in his misery and agony of mind
he cursed flavia graham the cause of
all the unhappy business he cursed his
friend and chum tom bartlett for al-
lowing such a distorted version of the
trip to be bruited abroad he cursed him-
self for his selfish absorption in his own
petty jealousy and troubles

  and the train sped toward its destina-
tion while heyward counted the minutes
and miles that separated him from chi-
cago and the girl he loved

  the next morning a cab bore him at
top speed from the station to the address
given in flavias telegram the number
designated proved to be an unpretentious-
looking house the sign upon the door
bearing simply the name  dr vernet

  in answer to heywards ring a woman
in the uniform of a trained nurse opened
the door she showed heyward into a
pleasant little reception - room and de-
parted in search of the doctor returning
shortly with the information that dr
vernet would see mr haven-the name
he had given-at once

  dr vernet was smooth-shaven short
and stout he wore dark glasses he
talked in a throaty manner that was not
altogether unpleasant and opened the in-
terview with an apology for the condi-
tion of his voice due he explained to a
disagreeable cold from which he was suf-
fering

  in response to heywards eager ques-
tions he stated that four days previous-
ly a gentleman giving the name of bart-
lett had called in company with a lady
who answered to the description given
by mr haven yes mrs graham had
been there but she had left the day be-
fore mr bartlett arrived no the doc-
tor regretted that he had no idea where
she had gone she had come there for
complete rest and treatment for nervous
breakdown and had improved greatly
under his treatment he was glad to say
he had wished her to remain until a
complete cure was effected but she had

been anxious to be gone it seemed and
had departed as soon as possible

  disheartened and discouraged hey-
ward thanked the doctor for this meager
information and stood up to go

  mr haven mr haven ha ha
heyward started and the doctor smiled

  dont be alarmed mr haven he
said reassuringly  it is only that very
rude parrot of mine he is very quick
to pick things up and probably heard
you give your name to the maid at the
door see-

  he lifted a corner of the curtain which
hid the swinging gilt cage in which a
green and red parrot nodded solemnly
on a perch

   pretty poll  heyward said mov-
ing closer to examine the bird  a very
fine specimen doctor

   yes and  am very proud of his
accomplishments replied the physician
  am very sorry i can be of so little
assistance to you in your quest mr
haven he added

   thank you for what you have been
able to give me doctor answered hey-
ward  good-by polly i le turned to
go there was a tug at his coat a sound
of rending cloth and the mischievous
parrot edged rapidly away from the bars
of the cage through which he had thrust
his strong hooked beak sufficiently far
to grasp the edge of the pocket of hey-
wards coat

   that wretched bird  exclaimed the
doctor ruefully examining the jagged
little tear  i am so sorry mr haven

i-

  oh its nothing haywaid inter-
rupted him  nothing at all the tail-
or can fix it in a few minutes if you
can give me a pin ill patch it up until
i can get it repaired

   certainly   said the doctor briskly
 i have one here drawing it from un-
der the lapel of his coat  permit me
and he fastened the torn edges together
deftly  it will hardly be noticed be-
lieve me mr haven i am exceedingly
distressed poll shall be punished for
such vandalism i had thought better of
his manners

   oh dont punish him i icyward pro-
tested  it really doesnt matter but
i have already taken up too much of
your time thank you again doctor

  he went down the steps and entered
bea berkeleys butterfly



the waiting cab directing the driver to
go to the new auditorium it was just
possible he told himself that beatrice
might have been there she always
stopped there when she came to chicago

  from behind his dark glasses dr ver-
net watched the departure of the cab
with an inscrutable smile

  the information which heyward ob-
tained at the hotel was as unsatisfactory
as that with which vernet had furnished
him miss berkeley had been registered
there but had left three days before
the clerk understood that it was her in-
tention to return at once to new york
he had overheard her say something
about getting back home and that was
all

  at the end of his resources heyward
turned to the dining-room he had eaten
nothing since noon the day before but
after ordering luncheon he finally arose
from the table leaving the food almost
untouched paid his check and left the
hotel

  four oclock found him again in the
train speeding back over the same weary
miles he had traveled such a short time
before

  that night he slept the sleep of ex-
haustion outraged nature claimed her
own and for a few brief hours he found
relief from the mental anguish which
gripped him in his waking moments

  if beatrice berkeley had in truth re-
turned to new york she would be at
her hotel or she would have sent some
word there thither he took his way as
soon as he left the train at the grand
central station next morning

  as he sprang from the taxicab at the
door of the bismarck his face lighted
up for there ahead of him just going
into the ladies entrance was beatrice
herself he quickened his steps in or-
der to overtake her but just as the boy
opened the door for him the click of the
elevator-gate and a glimpse of the ascend-
ing car told him that he had missed it

  it was with a happy smile however
that he turned to the friendly clerk at the
desk

   will you ask miss berkeley if she
will see me right away   he asked
eagerly

  por an instant the clerk regarded him
blankly

   miss-i-er-she-i believe she is

out mr heyward he stammered
avoiding the young mans eyes

  no she isnt i just saw her come
in ahead of me contradicted heyward
 ask her if i may come up at once
will you  

 you did oh very well then
mark  - he turned to the boy at the
switchboard- ask mrs bartlett if she
will see mr heyward

  mrs bartlett the room seemed to
whirl before heywards eyes he put out
an uncertain hand and clutched the edge
of the desk

  mrs bartlett he faltered you
-you are sure  there is no mistake  
 no-there is no mistake mr hey-
ward didnt you know   the clerks
voice was very low he looked down at
the desk before him and then at hey-
ward his eyes full of sympathy and pity

   no almost whispered the stricken
man  i-i had not heard

   mrs bartlett says will mr heyward
please come up right away droned the
voice of the boy at the switchboard

  to heyward the nasal tones seemed to
come from a long distance off he re-
garded the operator in a dazed sort of
way then he slowly took off his hat
drew out his handkerchief and wiped
the beads of cold perspiration from his
forehead

   mrs bartlett says will you please
come up right away mr heyward
repeated the boy half turning in his chair
and looking over his shoulder-

  and it was then that jimmie heyward
showed the stuff of which he was made
he shoved the handkerchief back into his
pocket put on his hat and turned to the
clerk who stood watching him with a
half-frightened air

   by jove  he said easily  do you
know i forgot all about a man ive got
to see when i caught a glimpse of mrs
bartlett the fellow just slipped com-
pletely out of my mind  hell be waiting
for me-and ill get into trouble if i
dont appear

  he turned to the boy at the switch-
board

   explain to mrs bartlett that ill have
to postpone coming up will you he
asked pleasantly  and beg her to ex-
cuse me right he added  as the
somewhat astonished youth transmitted
the message through the telephone


railroad aians magazine

  and turning on his heel his shoulders
square his head erect his hands thrust
deep into the pockets of his coat he
passed out of the door and into the busy
street from which it seemed to him all
sunshine and gladness had fled forever

chapter xviii
one and the same

 t ook out there 

  -l there was a confused medley of
shouts and curses a heavy hand on his
arm and heyward awoke from his black
reverie to find himself jerked rudely lo
one side while a huge automobile sped
swiftly over the very spot where he had
been standing an instant before

   why dont you look where yere goin
-philanderin acrost fifth avenoo like
it was a rose-garden the tall traffic
policeman glowered indignantly as he
stood by the curb still clutching the arm
of the man whom he had drawn from
the path of death

   i beg your pardon-i was thinking-
i did not notice stammered heyward
apologetically

   no i shouldnt think you did get
along now wherever yere goin and do
your thinkin somewheres besides the
middle of the avenoo

  the policeman gave him a good-na-
tured shove and heyward mechanically
stepped upon the sidewalk looking about
him in half surprise

  he was standing at the intersection of
his own street with the avenue how
had he come there surely he could
not have walked up from the bismarck
yet there was no other explanation for
his presence he had certainly not taken
a cab or car in his preoccupation he
must have directed his steps toward
home

  with a shrug of his shoulders he
turned westward and half a moment
later entered the burrell where his rooms
were situated touching the bell of his
own apartment

  the door was opened by wilkins his
man who eyed the master with covert
disfavor

   mr heyward sir

 yes wilkins wearily  im back
yes sir so i see sir i waited for
you to come aboard the mermaid sir

and when you didnt return at the time
you said i come ere thinkin you might
need me sir

   beg pardon mr heyward sir but
what avc you been a doin your coat
is torn and your hand is all bloody sir 

  is it heyward looked down in-
differently  so it is wilkins oh i
remember now he added as his eyes
fell upon the jagged scratch that adorned
the back of his left hand extending from
the base of the index finger nearly to the
wrist  i tore my coat and pinned it
together and must have torn my hand
on the pin

   beggin your pardon mr heyward
sir it must have been an uncommon
large pin to tear right through your glove
that way wilkins was solicitously ex-
amining the injury as he spoke

   my glove  why-i-i guess i must
have neglected to put my glove on
wilkins

  the man turned a look of dismayed
horror on his master but heyward did
not notice it he slipped out of his coat
and turned it over in his hand remov-
ing as he did so the pin which held the
torn hap of the pocket in place

   yes he continued  out in chi-
cago  

  the cry burst from him involuntarily
for in his palm lay-a mounting-pin the
exact duplicate of the one he had seen
impaling the butterfly in the morgue

  he stared at it for a moment in stupe-
faction vernet and his sanatorium-the
dark glasses-the cold the doctor had
deprecated-flavia grahams telegram
-all the incidents leading up to and fol-
lowing his trip to chicago flashed across
his brain with crystal clearness

  vernet was bult

  he sank into a chair

   fool fool  he groaned half
aloud  not to have suspected-not to
have known  oh fool

  wilkins stood at his side divided be-
tween astonishment and dignified disgust
mr heyward had not been himself of
late-but to-day-this extraordinary con-
duct-was he-was he intoxicated

  mr heyward sir he ventured
timidly but heyward did not even hear
him and he retreated to the other side
of the room watching his master closely

  yes there could be no shadow of
doubt vernet was bult and beatrice
bea berkeleys butterfly



-we-beatrice need have no fear she
was safe in new york-and married to
tom bartlett beatrice was married to
bartlett

  and lie jimmie heyward had been be-
trayed by his friend-made a mock and
a laughing-stock by the woman on whose
sincerity on whose integrity he would
have staked everything he possessed
the thought was maddening yet-it
was too late

  but what of flavia where was she
undoubtedly still in chicago from where
she had sent those telegrams in chica-
go was she again in the power of bull
it was more than possible-it was al-
most certain

  perhaps she had known nothing of the
telegrams that had called beatrice to
chicago-or perhaps bult had forced her
to send them but what more simple
than that he should himself sign her name
to the message

  yernet had said that she was no longer
there-but had he told the truth had
he not lied was she not still there in
that house where he could undisturbed
wreak his revenge upon her heyward
shuddered as he thought of the threats
bult had made-of the look of malignant
hatred in his fierce black eyes

  whatever flavias faults whatever
crimes she might have committed with
all her soul she hated and feared this
man this lying cheating impostor she
had sent for beatrice-eatrice had had
the whole of the telegram  she must have
known that some danger threatened her
cousin and yet-she had allowed bult
to deceive her too

  bartlett had allowed bult to deceive
him even as he heyward had been hood-
winked but bartlett too had known
the whole of the telegram he should
never have permitted bult to impose upon
him

  but both beatrice and bartlett en-
grossed in their own plans wrapped up
in each other had been only too ready to
believe that flavia was safe that they
might return home and this they had
done leaving a helpless woman in the
power of this fiend 

  all the natural chivalry of jimmie
heywards nature rose in revolt at such
criminal carelessness oh if he had only
known when he was there with  ernet

   wilkins  he called  i must go to

chicago at once  put a couple of changes
into my grip-and then get me a bite to
eat im off on the flier again this after-
noon  

   what he whispered to himself as
from the train window he watched the
panorama of the landscape- what if i
should be too late 

   too late  sang the swiftly revolving
wheels

   too late  screamed the exhaust of
the engine

  the daylight faded the train seemed
to be rushing directly into the glory of
crimson and gold in the west still hey-
ward sat staring out with unseeing eyes
the sunset miracle faded one by one
the stars peeped out

   do you wish your berth made up
sir  it was the voice of the porter

  heyward started and looked at his
watch it was eleven oclock for a
moment he hesitated then he shook his
head of what use to go to bed he
could not sleep

   no he answered  not yet ill
ring for you when im ready he sank
back in his section and turned to the
window again

  how black the night was the tele-
graph-poles seemed flying by in a long
seemingly endless procession the stars
looked cold and far away

  spectral forms hovered over him in the
darkness horrid faces leered at him an
icy hand touched his in his ear a hol-
low voice shrieked out too late  

  a pool of black water yawned before
him on the brink flavia graham strug-
gled in the embrace of a ghastly skele-
ton he heard her pitiful cry for mercy
-saw a gleam of iridescent light it
was the emerald butterfly upraised over
her shrinking form

  and the face of the grinning horror
that held the weapon was that of bult
heyward tried to move to rush to the
womans rescue but he seemed held
down by bands of iron

  the upraised arm was descending he
heard flavias last despairing shriek-
saw her close her eyes and fall back-

  with a violent effort he sat up blink-
ing his eyes a flood of sunlight envel-
oped him about him was the noise and
bustle of departure the train had come
to a standstill in the chicago terminal-
and he had sat up all night
railroad mans magazine

  exhausted rather than refreshed by
his haunted slumbers he dragged his
weary limbs from the seat and gather-
ing together his belongings stumbled
down the aisle and out of the car to the
platform walking slowly out to the cab-
stands he tried to collect his scattered
thoughts

  suddenly he was galvanized into new
life was it-could it be-was iiis over-
wrought brain tricking him for there
just entering a cab was beatrice her-
self  and he had left her in new york
it was impossible inconceivable that she
should be here

  he sprang forward  but in the moment
of indecision the cab-door had shut with
a bang the vehicle swung about and rat-
tled down the street at a good pace to be
lost in the maze of traffic

  it took heyward a full minute to real-
ize what had happened how had bea-
trice come to be in chicago where was
bartlett was it possible that he had
made a mistake yesterday-that it was
not beatrice he had seen was it pos-
sible that the clerk of the bismarck had
mixed things up-that beatrice was not
married to bartlett after all--

  he wheeled and dashed through the
waiting-room to the telephone-booths

   get me the bismarck hotel new
york he directed the operator excited-
ly  i want to talk to mrs bartlett-
no one else rush it please- he fid-
geted around uneasily while the connec-
tion was being made

   number four booth for new york
announced the operator after what
seemed a wait of hours  mrs bartlett
-are you there-heres your party sir
-go ahead 

   hello   heyward said in a voice that
he vainly tried to hold steady

  hello came clearly back the
tones were unmistakably those of bea-
trice berkeley-no beatrice bartlett

   hello-this is heyward jimmie
heyward  he called into the trans-
mitter im in chicago are you in
new york  it sounded banal foolish 
but this was  time for conversational
brilliancy

   why surely  be heard the well-
known voice say  arent you talking to
me here what are you doing in chi-
cago we-tom and t-were so sur-
prised and disappointed yesterday when

you wouldnt come up why didnt you 
you know- did you know that  had
married tom bartlett hello-hello-
why dont you answer hello-chi-
cago-central did you cut off-hello
-hello-  the click of the receiver as
heyward snapped it upon the hook was
the only reply that the wires carried to
new york

       chapter xix
       your game is up

tlteyward paid the toll mechanical-
aa ly and walked slowly out lie
had no definite plan of action the bot-
tom seemed somehow to have fallen out
of things suddenly the thought of fla-
via flashed across his brain he hailed a
cab and directed the driver to go to the
address on marquette street black rage
was seething within him it had been
almost impossible for his overtired brain
to comprehend the action of beatrice in
marrying bartlett impossible to imagine
bartlett as a party to such a breach of
faith with his chum as that involved in
this monstrous farce while he-hey-
ward-had been toiling like a galley-slave
in her cause beatrice berkeley had been
listening to the words of love of tom
bartlett had been repeating the vows
that separated her forever from the man
whose one thought was for her perhaps
they had even laughed at him-laughed
at the devotion that he offered to the girl
who had scorned it and flung it aside like
a broken fan and bartlett-he- had been
ready to send beatrice to prison and dis-
grace on the strength of weak circum-
stantial evidence and now-he had prom-
ised to love her forever would he keep
that promise heyward thrust his head
out of the window and shouted at the
cabman

   drive faster  by way of answer
the driver whipped up the rack of bones
by courtesy called a horse the cab
swung into marquette street

   here ye are  called the jehu peer-
ing down from his perch as he pulled
the cab up with a jerk in front of dr
vernets house

  directing the man to wait heyward
climbed the steps and rang the bell the
door was opened by the same nurse who
had admitted him on -the occasion of his
bea berkeleys butterfly



previous visit the doctor was in she
thought she would call him if mr haven
would step in she ushered heyward
into the little reception-room and a mo-
ment later the doctor entered

  mr haven ah yes i remember
you were here a few days ago how
can i serve you this morning 

   by telling me what you have done
with flavia graham heyward an-
swered crisply rising to his feet and con-
fronting the smaller man

   my dear sir  told you the other day
that  know nothing of mrs graham
or her present whereabouts he said
 she-

   cut all that out  commanded hey-
ward savagely  i know you dr ver-
net-bult-kalb your game is about up
youve had your innings and now its
my turn at the bat

  the doctor shrugged his shoulders
 are you crazy and have you come for
treatment he asked solicitously  or
are you just an ordinary crank  do
not quite understand

   dont you   heyward asked with
rising anger  well it wont take me
long to explain i know that mrs gra-
ham was here and i know that you know
where she is now ill give you just two
minutes to tell me he drew out his
watch

   i do not recall denying that mrs
graham was here replied vernet  but
 do deny that i know where she is now
and  also deny your right to question
me in this manner you are insolent
sir and i shall have you removed from
the house

   i shouldnt advise vou to try it
heyward remarked coolly  unless you
wish to land in jail i told you the game
was played out if you wish me to make
it any clearer i dont mind telling you
that the instant you put your foot out of
the door you will be taken into custody
and jailed 

  arrested for what i have com-
mitted no crime again i demand that
you leave this house at once i 

  very well ill go heyward said
turning as if to leave  but let me tell
you just this-mrs van der poel one
of your victims in the beauty-parlor
swindle you worked so successfully in
new york has at last consented out of
regard for miss berkeley upon whom

  all the onus of the scandal rested to
swear out a warrant for your arrest on
the charge of obtaining money under
false pretenses there is a policeman
waiting for you now outside

  the doctor paled a little  i do not
believe it he said   and even if it were
so this is not new york a new york
warrant would have no jurisdiction here

   you dont suppose i was fool enough
to think it had do you  demanded hey-
ward  extradition papers have been
granted and your liberty isnt worth a
brass nickel theres just one way you
can save yourself from going to jail he
continued pausing an instant to let ver-
net-or kalb-get the full effect of the
threat and that is to give me full and
definite information as to the present
whereabouts of flavia graham refuse
-and well youll see the inside of a cell
within an hour

   i tell you i dont know  declared
the doctor nervously pacing up and
down  this is terrible i assure you
heyward mrs graham left here several
days ago in company with your friend
bartlett and her cousin miss berkeley
since then i have seen or heard nothing
of her i havent an idea where she is
i believe youre lying heyward
informed him  it isnt in you to tell
the truth very well if you wont tell
you wont ill see  it that youre in
jail before dark well see if that will
open your mouth

   you cant send me to jail on any
such trumped-up charge reiterated the
other  theres no question of obtain-
ing money under false pretenses the
treatment was all right just as i guar-
anteed it to be but my patients decamped
without waiting for the end of the course
and surely i cannot be held responsible
for the results which naturally attended
their leaving my care

  of course they were expected to re-
main in a deserted house without food or
attendance sneered heyward

   not at all the doctor hastened to
inform him  unfortunately all my
help went on strike mrs graham and
i went out at once to see if we could
secure others during our absence you
appeared told the patients some cock-
and-a-bull story and when i returned
the house was empty the birds had
flown i discovered what a stir the affair


railroad mans magazine

had caused and knowing the fuitility of
explanations where women are con-
cerned  decided to wait until the thing
had blown over and then seek some re-
dress from the calumnies which bad been
heaped upon me and now you come
with this fresh outrage

  heyward laughed outright  pretty
good at that he commended but
you should have an example of your
wonderful cure to show to the skeptical
like myself

   what more do you desire than mrs
graham miss berkeley-

   yes and mrs van der poel and
miss schuyler scoffed heyward
once more where is mrs graham

  to the best of my knowledge and
belief she is somewhere in chicago
replied the doctor sitting down in an
easy chair and looking at heyward with
a tolerant air as if he were some one
badly afflicted but whom it would be well
to humor  suppose you go and find
her

  across heywards memory flashed the
face he had that morning seen in the
window of the cab at the station why
of course-how stupid he had been not
to suspect it before - that was flavia
herself

  he turned to the wailing doctor

   look here bult he said   under-
stand that is your name-i dont for a
moment believe all you have said but
im going to give you a trial ill go out
and see if i can locate mrs graham
im afraid it will be a good deal like
looking for the proverbial needle in a
haystack but ill try it anyhow

   in case i dont come across her by
this time to-morrow  come back here
and have a heart to heart talk with you
in the mean time dont try to slip away
because the house is watched and if you
get into the clutches of the law its back
to new york for yours think well be-
fore you decide to go out walking

  he picked up his hat and turned to the
door but the doctor stopped him

   one moment mr heyward i think
before you go that it would be better
for you to understand me a little more
clearly there was an earnest tone in
the mans voice which compelled hey-
wards attention

   in the first place you seem to have
the impression that i have injured flavia

graham i have done nothing of the
sort on the contrary i have performed
a great service for her the value of which
you will appreciate when you see her
as for miss berkeley-

   one moment interrupted heyward
if i have any such impression you
yourself are responsible for it  recall
quite clearly what you said the night you
were at my rooms-the threats you made
against both mrs graham and miss
berkeley i have no reason to suppose
that your feelings toward either of those
ladies have changed materially since that
time

  the doctor shrugged his shoulders

   quite so he assented  but you
have made no allowance for the excitcd
state in which i was at that time a
valuable-i may say priceless-discovery
had been stolen from me i was natural-
ly angry-what man in my place would
not have been i knew that flavia gra-
ham had the packet which meant untold
wealth fame and success to me

   what would you have done in my
place taken it from her of course-
and that is just what  did no matter
what the method i used-that has noth-
ing to do with the case the fact re-
mains that once my precious packet was
again in my possession my thirst for re-
venge vanished

   i have a somewhat ungovernable
temper mr heyward when wrought up
to such a pitch of rage as i was that
night i am hardly responsible for what
 may say or do i am used to being
obeyed and flavia graham always dis-
obeyed me-when she dared

   however that is all past and gone
i am quite through with my sister-in-
law as i presume she is through with
me by her somewhat unwilling assist-
ance i have been enabled to prove the
value of my discovery i have estab-
lished this place here and here i propose
to remain-unless you take steps to force
me to leave

   as for miss berkeley-she has some-
thing which rightly belongs to me i
shall one day secure it-if i can but
in the meantime she as well as almhe
rest of you arc quite safe from me

  heyward laughed

   if not we soon will be-if you go
out before this time to-morrow he ob-
served  and now im going i dont
bea berkeleys butterfly



believe the half of what youve just told
me-but it really doesnt matter if i
find that mrs graham is safe and is
willing to let the matter drop t shall be
only too glad to wash my hands of you
and all your works

   but -and his voice grew hard-
 if i am unable to find her or if i learn
that you have in any way injured her
it will go hard with you miss berkeley
has some one who can look out for her
welfare-and i propose to make myself
responsible for that of mrs graham

  he turned o the front door and
opened it on the steps he paused

   remember  he warned and walked
down to the cab

  he was beginning to- feel very tired
indeed days of racking mental torture
nights that were sleepless or worse than
sleepless rendered imperative of com-
plete rest

  at the present time it was impossible
for him to dismiss all perplexities from
his mind but he decided that he would
go to the new auditorium and strive to
get at least a few hours sleep before
taking up his search for the missing
flavia

  as the cab rattled off down the street
the doctor turned away from the win-
dow shaking his head

   its a good thing t figured out he
wasnt as easy to handle as he looks he
reflected  i was wise to get those two
women off my hands  wonder just how
much truth there was in that story about
extradition papers i hardly think those
new york women would really consent
to appear against me-but perhaps it will
be just as well to take  chances

chapter xx

 jimmie dont you know me

a t the door of the hotel heyward
paid the exorbitant charge of the
cabman without a murmur he was far
too tired to stand and haggle over the
price

  engaging his room he was about to
enter the elevator when he collided some-
what forcibly with a woman who was
just stepping out

   i beg your pardon he said mechan-
ically lifting his hat  i hope i didnt
hurt you

 why jimmie heyward what are
you doing here cried the object of his
solicitation extending a daintily gloved
hand

   laura bryce  exclaimed heyward
grasping it firmly and shaking it with
warmth  this is a surprise i might
ask the same of you why so far from
milwaukee town 

   just taking a flying trip to new york
with fred-mr bryce-and a young
friend of mine whom i am chaperoning
she has been staying for a few days
with me and-but youre looking wretch-
edly jimmie what have you been
doing to yourself 

   im just tired heyward said  ive
been chasing around a good bit and i
suppose i do look rather done up

   you certainly do mrs bryce de-
clared with conviction  but were
keeping the elevator waiting come
along up to my rooms and sit down for
a few minutes i want to talk to you
 oh  say laura youll have to ex-
cuse me he protested im all in
down and out ill see you in the
morning

   indeed ill do nothing of the kind
mrs bryce answered calmly  youre
going up now were leaving early in
the morning besides theres some one
up there who will be glad to see you
come along

   but-

   come along ill not take  for an
answer

   who is it  he inquired wearily sub-
mitting perforce to the demands of the
impetuous young woman im not in
company trim you know

   youll find out soon enough mrs
bryce answered mysteriously  theres
a tiresome man waiting for me but ill
get rid of him as soon as i can and hurry
right back

  she led the way out of the car and
opened the front door of her apartment

  are you there dearie she called
raising her voice  heres some one to
see you the front room jimmie

  she gave heywards arm a friendly
little pat and pushed him toward a door
on the right

  go in it jimmie-dont be afraid
she said and with a smile was gone

  heyward went slowly into the room
indicated he wondered idly who it was


railroad mans magazine

that laura bryce wanted him to see
well it didnt much matter only he
wished heartily that he had been a min-
ute before or a minute later and then he
could have gone straight to his room and
gotten some of the sleep for which he
craved how good it would be to sleep
soundly once more

  the door behind him opened and some
one entered  his ear caught a little silken
rustle and he turned about just as the
newcomer touched the electric button and
flooded the room with light

   flavia graham  he gasped

  but what a flavia vernet had told
the truth-for the face of the woman be-
fore him was as delicately colored as a
rose-petal and without suggestion of line
or wrinkle

  she was in evening dress and the soft
wistaria folds fell about her in graceful
clinging lines leaving her neck and arms
bare around her throat a band of wis-
taria velvet was held in place by the
emerald butterfly

  she gave a little rippling laugh

   why jimmie dont you know me 
 of course he answered his eyes
still fixed on her face  youre flavia
graham

  not flavia graham jimmie bea-
trice berkeley

  but heyward knew better

  oh no he laughed you see i
saw beatrice in new york yesterday
the beautiful miss berkeley was-i
beg her pardon i should have said mrs
bartlett the laughter died from his
lips

   i assure you jimmie youve been
 seeing things as laura would say
protested the young woman  the per-
son you saw was flavia-

   she was not  retorted heyward
hotly  i guess i know beatrice when
i see her besides i talked to her in
new york over the long-distance tele-
phone this morning and she-

   did she jay she was beatrice 

   no she said she was mrs bartlett
grimly  but i-pshaw  do you sup-
pose i dont know her-that i could pos-
sibly mistake her for any one else  

   mrs van der poel thought she knew
too said the girl softly  jimmie boy
you need convincing too look-is the
butterfly under the velvet-or not  

  she slipped the band up a trifle and

lifted the emerald butterfly which lay
a splash of living fire on her white
throat

  heyward bent forward with dry lips
his breath caught sharply and his eyes
half closed

  for the little butterfly mark-was
there

   beatrice  he cried catching at her
hand  beatrice-is it you then who
-who is the wife of dr bartlett 
flavia to be sure i-why jimmie
take care  she sprang forward and
caught his arm

  im all right he smiled faintly
 it was the heat-im tired out-the
shock of seeing you- he sank weakly
into a chair

  let me get you some wine miss
berkeley said  that will make you-
 no-i dont want any wine just sit
down there and let me look at you-let
me be sure that i am not dreaming again
and that i am not going to wake up and
find that you are only a vision he said
softly

   but jimmie how could you imagine
that i had married tom bartlett she
asked reproachfully slipping into a big
morris chair opposite heyward

   i dont know beatrice the papers
all said you-you had-

  eloped she finished scornfully
 and you believed every word of that
nonsense  

   no but then i saw you-saw flavia
at the bismarck and asked for you and
the clerk said  mrs bartlett  and-

   i see  she laughed  he probably
mistook flavia for me it was quite
natural she is very like me now since
kalb-or vernet-restored her complex-
ion i verily believe it was the only de-
cent thing the old villain ever did and
his motive was probably entirely con-
trary to the result thereof

   her complexion-kalb-im all at
sea beatrice youll have to play pilot
if you dont mind

   its a long story jimmie-

  never mind i want to hear it-all
how you came to chicago and what
happened here - everything about it
how flavia came to marry bartlett-the
whole menu from oysters to cafe noir
 but jimmie youre tired-

   im not he interrupted  i was
but i forgot all about that long ago
bea berkeleys butterfly



heyward looked ten years younger than
the broken world-weary man who had
entered the room half an hour before

       chapter xxi
       the door closes

yxell beatrice began leaning
back and clasping her hands be-
hind her head  i got a telegram from
flavia tuesday of last week in which
she said  in power of kalb prisoner
goes under name of vernet xo - mar-
quette street chicago hurry flavia

   of course i thought first of you but
no one knew where you had gone and
i couldnt find you then  telephoned
to dr bartlett and learned that he too
had received a message and was about
to send me word before leaving  his
mission of rescue i called up miss
allbright but she had a contagious case
and coidd not come

   i dared tell no one else so i started
alone with dr barilett to look after me
we went at once to the address flavia
had mentioned in her message and saw
the doctor it was kalb beyond a doubt
yet very cleverly disguised any one
who did not know him as well as i did
might readily have been deceived

   he said flavia had gone away dr
bartlett told him he lied and accused
him of being kalb of course lie de-
nied it but he was plainly a little discon-
certed then we heard a muffled scream 
it was flavias voice

   dr bartlett waited for  more al-
most before i knew what he was about
he had knocked the doctor down and
had tied his hands and feet with cords
that he cut from the shades then he
rushed up-stairs with me at his heels
he shouted and flavia called back  e
found the room where she was im-
prisoned the door was locked but dr
bartlett burst it in we found her alone

   the poor girls elbows were fastened
at her sides so that although she could
use her hands she could not raise her
arms to her head

   her face was covered with one of
those hideous masks and when dr bart-
lett cut the cords that bound her arms
the first thing she did was to tear it off

  jimmie it was startling for a mo-
ment i thought i was looking at my own

face in the mirror then she began to
cry and begged that we take her away at
once from that awful place

   while we were waiting for a cab
miss berkeley continued  flavia told
us how she had come to chicago that
she had been given chloroform while
asleep in the train and brought to the
place where we found her

   kalb told her that he was going to
cure her wrinkles and tied her in a chair
then he put a lot of things on her face
and she said the pain was terrible but
although she screamed no one heard or
if they did paid no attention

   for two weeks he kept her there
every day he would come in and make
remarks about the  poetic justice  of his
curing her complexion for her after he
had made it what it was when you saw
her i forgot to tell you that-jimmie
that fiend was responsible for all her
wrinkles and yellow color

   fie put some chemicals on her skin
while she was staying with her sister
his wife just out of revenge for some-
thing she did which he had told her not
to do he kept her there for two weeks
she tried to bribe the nurse but the wom-
an only laughed at her

   then one day she managed to find
the stub of a pencil and wrote three mes-
sages-one to you one to dr bartlett
and one to me she threw two of them
out of the window with a piece of money
wrapped in the paper and an appeal to
the finder to send it at once

   just as she was going to throw out
the one to you the doctor came in and
caught her fie took the pencil and paper
away from her tied her in the chair
again and kept her without food for two
whole days

   fie released her only the morning we
came from her window she saw us as
we came up the street and screamed to
let us know where to find her

   well then dr bartlett said the only
way to take care of her properly was for
him to marry her he said that he had
been sure that he loved her from the
night she came to your rooms to ask you
to help her escape west and that a mar-
riage with him would give him the right
to look after her she consented after a
while and we all went direct to laura
bryce in milwaukee and they were mar-
ried there she paused

   i wish id been there heyward
murmured  there would have been a
double wedding-with your permission
he added as an afterthought beatrice
flushed rosily

   i mean it heyward said earnest-
ly  i shant be happy until youre
safely married to me dear you know
how i care for you-have known it this
good while ive come too near losing
you several times lately to want to risk
it again i tasted the bitterness of hell
these last few days when i thought
you were married to tom beatrice
dear-will you-do you think you could
love me just a little do you suppose
that you could learn to care for me
enough  

  the flush on her cheeks deepened

   ive cared enough for a long time
jimmie she said softly but before
 give you any definite promise all this
talk about dr bartlett and me must be
stopped i cant-

   what do we care what people are
saying  he demanded  flavia is mar-
ried to tom-no one will know that you
were really the one who went to chicago

the

 on that train they will think it was
 havia and all the newspapers will be
 falling over themselves making apol-
 ogies

    dr bartlett has returned to mrs van
 der poel miss schuyler and the rest all
 the money they paid to kalb-or what-
 ever his real name is said beatrice re-
 flectively  the jacket was finally re-
 covered from the river-and he says he
 is going to tell mrs van der poel the
 whole story i believe everything will
 be right for him and flavia

    he wouldnt care whether society
 turned him out or not-so long as he has
 the woman he loves said heyward
  but that has nothing to do with us
 mrs bryce is going lo chaperon you to
 new york right away and then- he
 rose and went to her side

  there was a knock at the door
neither heard it another still they
remained oblivious then the door
opened softly and laura bryce appeared
on the threshold

   for an instant she stood there then
 with a quiet smile she stole out again
 gently closing the door behind her

operating gost of pennsy electric
engines

george gibbs clectrical engineer of
the pennsylvania railroad recently
gave some data concerning the first
years electrical operation of the pennsyl-
vania at the new york terminal the main
line from harrison new jersey to the ter-
minal station is about nine miles long of
this six and one-half miles are on the level
and the rest of the line through the tunnels
ami its approaches has some very heavy
grades the service is largely handled by
electric locomotives the tunnel is much
drier than was anticipated and there is
therefore a better factor of adhesion

  the locomotives made a total of 
miles during the year of which 
miles was road service while the remainder
was for switching and transfer the loco-
motives averaged  miles for the year
ami the service was entirely satisfactory
the cost of repairs per mile run was 
cents this is greater than was expected
and was largely due to the cost of mainte-
nance of the brake shoes to tire turning
and to a number of structural changes
which it was necessary to make after the
locomotives were placed in service on

the new jersey division the cost of repairs
to steam locomotives was  cents per
mile while for the pennsylvania as a whole
the cost was  cents per mile the lu-
brication of electrical locomotives cost 
cents per mile or about the same as for the
steam locomotives the engine-house ex-
pense for the electric locomotives amount-
ed to  cents per mile while for steam
locomotives on the pennsylvania it amount-
ed to  cents per mile

  the important savings were therefore
in the repairs and the engine-house ex-
penses the electric locomotives are given
a daily inspection and after every 
miles run are given a detail inspection
which requires about four hours time
when the electrical operation was first
started the locomotives were given a de-
tail inspection after every  miles but
this has been gradually increased to 
as the reliability of these locomotives has
become more evident there were only 
failures of electric locomotives during the
year and for the multiple unit trains which
made about  miles there were only
three detentions
at the ticket window

what is the most foolish question you ever heard mr station agent
now dont all answer and say it was  what time does the three
oclock train leave  there are many that are just as foolish and if
you ever heard one that can beat those published below give it a clearance and
send it to the magazine

imagine the look that came into the
face of j p duck jr the agent at
carrsville virginia when a woman
appeared at the ticket-window and blithely
asked  may i take a sleeper without going
to sleep 

  think of the problem that d g williams
of st petersburg florida had to solve
when an old lady who was about to take
her first railroad journey asked  when
will the railroad have its next accident
marvel at the domestic secret that was
entrusted to william g yates of albion
new york when he was summoned to the
telephone and a sweet voice said  mister
when my husband calls for a ticket tell him
that the baby is asleep  

  and just picture that gratified feeling of
the b and o agent at lester ohio when
he received the following postal i left a
large black pocketbook at the depot tues-
day it had two eggs and some fancy-work
and a piece of cheese you can keep the
cheese if you have found the pocketbook
i will call for it

not long ago a daintily dressed young
lady whose profusion of blushes in-
dicated that she was a bride ginger-

the branch of the illinois central
railway running from freeport
illinois to dodgeville wisconsin crosses
the line of the chicago milwaukee and st

wisconsin to mineral point wisconsin at
a small and lonesome station named dill

  the railroad commission of wisconsin
recently passed a ruling compelling the
evening passenger trains  the two roads
due at dill at the same time in the eve-
ning to wait thirty minutes for connections
provided either train was late

  a few days ago a young ladv appeared
at the ticket-window as the agent was
out at the time the operator asked her

 what he could do for her and this was their
 conversation

 she-will the trains make connections at
 dill to-night

 opr-yes maam it they are not over
 thirty minutes late

 she-oh but dont they always wait

 opr-no you see when the illinois
 central train is late our train has to wait
 thirty minutes for them and when our
 train is late the illinois central train has to
 wait thirty minutes for us

 she-well if both trains are on time do
 they wait

 many a sharp curve lies before us

 many a tunnel long and drear

 all around are storms and dangers

 true hearts stricken fond hopes slain

 draw the curtain lest it blind us

 lest old envy steal upon us

 and we lose our engineer

 for the way is long before us-

 there are mountains we must climb

 streams to cross and caution signals
 but well make the run on time

 for the wheels are clicking sharply
 and the signals showing clear

 both our hearts are true and faithful-

private train

by franklin fisher

very little while there ap-
pears in the newspapers a
short announcement that
the president is about to
start on a long trip through
the country sometimes it
is to attend the opening of an exposition
or celebration the
launching of a
battle-ship the un-
veiling of a nation-
al monument or a
long speeclimaking
tour

  these announce-
ments are always
read with interest
by millions of
newspaper readers
but by reason of
their frequency
few people realize
what a long and
arduous task it is
to make the prepa-
rations for the trips
of a chief execu-
tive the great at-
tention to detail
which is necessary
to reduce the
chances of acci-
d ents to a mini-
mum and the scope
of the arrange-
ments

 time was when
but little attention
and care were given
to the preparation
of a presidential
journey since the
assassination of

jack wheeler the secret-service officer
who is in charge practically of every
special train on which the
president travels

 photograph by harr is tf ewing washington d c

president mckinley the secret service
and the presidents personal staff have
realized to a greater degree their re-
sponsibility

  they have perfected their system of
taking care of him to the extent that it is
now practically impossible for the presi-
dent to suffer be-
cause of lack of
forethought

  the men who are
responsible for his
personal safety are
the members of the
secret service who
are detailed for this
purpose at least
one of these men is
always near him
all were picked for
their alertness and
physical strength
and it would be
hard lo find in any
country a guard
which is more ca-
pable these men
have given years of
study and attention

first three is ill or fcr any other reason
is unable to attend to his duties

  lucien or  jack wheeler as he is
best known by nearly every police chief
railroad official and newspaper repc rter
in the country is the pivot upon which
the presidential journeys turn lie i-
the man who travels ahead rnd makes
the arrangements  the presidential
advance agent  is a name that has
frequently been given him and he lives
up to it he is about five feet ten inches
in height and tips the scales at about
one hundred and seventy-five pounds
stripped always in the pink of condi-
tion and immaculately dressed he pre-
sents the appearance of a prosperous
business man more than anything else

  when the president decides to travel
he makes his wish known to his secre-
tary and between them they decide how
long his duties will permit him to be
absent then the matter of the itinerary
is taken up unless it is a hurry trip
provision is made for speech-stops along
the route this matter is turned over

to the white house office force and a
tentative itinerary is prepared this
rough schedule is made up from a list
of the invitations which have been ex-
tended to the president by local organ-
izations these invitations come in to
the executive offices from all parts of
the country at the rate of from one to
a hundred a day

  then the traveling passenger-agent of
the railroad on which the presidential
trip is to start is called into consultation
i le is given a copy of the tentative
schedule he takes up the matter with
each of the other railroads over which
the president is to travel and makes ar-
rangements with the pullman company
to supply a special car each railroad
submits a lit of trains to which the
presidents special car may be attached

  from this information the final itin-
erary of the trip is compiled i he tem-
porary itinerary has to be cut when it
is found that the proper connection can-
not be made for the president of the
united states is a very busy man the
next step is the acceptance of the in-
guarding uncle sams private train

c

vitations where his time and route will
permit

  about two weeks ahead of the trip
jack wheeler usually covers the ground
he has no special car but travels like
any one else when lie reaches the
presidents first stopping-place mr
wheeler at once confers with the chief
of police the two definitely outline
the police arrangements then there is
a call on the members of the various
local committees who are to welcome the
president after that mr wheeler
starts at the station where the president
will leave the train and personally goes
over the presidents entire lino of march

  he makes a map of the route with
notes of the character of the streets and
the people who live on them he com-
municates with the nearest office of the
secret service and makes arrangements

to have a certain number of their men
on duty in such cities as new york
and chicago the police are sometimes
asked to patrol the roofs of the houses
along the line of march mr wheeler
looks up the criminal records of all the
local  suspects and they are shadowed
by the secret service operatives both
preceding and during the presidents
visit

  then comes the military protection
congress will not allow the president of
the united states to travel with a big
military escort such as other rulers have
the people of this country insist upon

the necessary military force in attend-
ance must recruit them from the nearest
army post and if that is too far away
and it usually is he has to depend 
the local militia to supply the gold braid
for tlie occasion

must be diplomatic too

 where mr wheelers diplomatic
ability comes into play is in the arrange-
ments for the social side of the visit
the president is usually the guest of
honor at a banquet a reception a din-
ner or a luncheon the secret-service
man aids in the tactful seating of the
guests this is always a matter where
great diplomacy must be used because
the presidents visit always arouses great
social rivalry there is always more
than one woman who lays claim to the
social leadership wheeler often has the
job of saying who shall it at the presi-
dents right hand and who shall sit at his
left and so on around the table

  the ease with which he handles ihesj
social events and ihe absence of friction
is abundant testimony to his abilitv

such a program has to be repeated in
every city that the president visits il
is very elaborate in the event of a special
or prolonged journey

  congress appropriates  yearly
for the presidents traveling expenses
it is the equivalent of a coast-to-coast
trip each year during his tenure of
office he has covered about  miles
and at the end of his four years as presi-
dent he will have spent t  for
transportation

  there may come a day when provision
will be made for better facilities for the
presidents railroad journeys as it is
his car is hooked onto all kinds of trains
usually on rear ends where the danger
is greatest he must eat his meals and
conduct his business in the little room at
the observation end every time the
train stops there is always a certain
number of local notables who call on
him and this impromptu reception must
lie held in this same small space

  plans have already been drawn for a
special train for him and without doubt
it will not be long before he has a train
which will be in keeping with his private

yacht his automobiles and his private
entrance and waiting room at the wash-
ington union station

  the plans and specifications for this
proposed special train call for three cars
of steel construction dust and draft
proof the first the one nearest the
locomotive to have quarters for the at-
tendants clothes closets and a room for
baggage at the front of the next car
would be a kitchen and next to that
would be the dining-room which be-
tween meals could be used as a confer-
ence chamber

  next to this and in the same car
would be the business office where the
force of stenographers and clerks would
do their work this room would be
fitted up with every facility for handling
business that would not wait until the
presidents return telephones would
be installed that could be connected at
any station and duplicators would be
used to make copies of the speeches to
be given to the newspapermen there
would be a miniature library composed
of the latest congressional directory the
white house lists copies of important
bills pending dictionaries and reference
books back of this would be a small
room equipped with surgical appliances
for the physician of the party this

room is as necessary as any other part
of the proposed train because of the ad-
vantage of having everything of this
kind at hand in case of accidents or
sudden illness just behind this and at
the end of this car would be quarters
for members of the presidents party

how a  rain is arranged

  the last car would be fitted up with
berths at the forward end for the secre-
taries and the secret-servioe men and a
separate compartment for the presi-
dents sleeping quarters the remainder
of the car would be used as his office
and his chair would be so arranged that
people could see him from both sides of
the track without his even looking up
from his work the rear platform
would be specially arranged to facilitate
receptions and speechmaking there
would be plenty of room with an en-
trance at one side and an exit at the
other so that his callers could see and
talk to him coining and going without
confusion and as quickly as possible

  the platform at the end would re-
semble the speakers stands at outdoor
gatherings with the corners rounded
and designed so that the proper acoustics
would be obtained the president could

speak and be heard without a tremen-
dous effort

  this train could always be kept in the
i nion station at w ashington on a track
that could be easily reached from the
presidents private waiting-room the
estimated cost of the train is about

  the railroads west of chicago give
mr wheeler carte blanche in the matter
of l lie number of employees necessary
when the president travels over their
lines there is a track-walker  every
mile of track and a switchman at every
switch the switchman watches and
waits for hours for the special car and
leaves only after the president has
passed safely to facilitate the move-
ment of the presidents train a high offi-
cial of the road usually travels with the
party

  as the railroad  which the journey
starts makes all arrangements with the
other roads over which the journey takes
the party so does that railroad make up
the charges for the entire transportation
the other roads send in their bills and

the charges are made up and sent to the

been passed by the auditing department
the bill is paid at the treasury and the
amount is charged against the

   < >h some kind of
iasi  i test i guess trying to
find out the pressure in
the cylinders a fellow told me

   i low many times this question is asked
on main lines throughout the country
and how seldom is it answered even as
understandingv as in this case

  taking moviif pictures from the
front end is a favorite reply

  i am going to give you some idea of
what is going on in that little black box
perched upon the bumper and what the
occupants who are frequently seen to
thrust their goggled and grimed faces
above the edge are doing besides review-
ing the flying landscape

  probably if the man who asked the
question had not been looking so intently
at the  contraption on the front end 
he would have noticed that there were
moreover a number of extra men in the
cab of no  and that sandwiched in
between the engine and the regular
make-up was an extra car which looked
like a cross between a baggage-car anil
a caboose this was the make-up for a
complete road-test

  when a road purchases new power or
converts old engines into new types th
operating department wants to know the
rating that the new machines may be
given full tonnage  the start without
any delays due to overloading or time
spent in experimenting with gradually
increasing loads under different condi-
tions


railroad mans magazine

  in the case of passenger-engines the
department must know how the new
engines compare in hauling capacity and
speed with others whose characteristics
are known before assigning them to a
regular run

  these facts are ascertained most
readily by the use of a dynamometer car
which by means of spring or lever scales
or a hydraulic cylinder actually weighs
the pulling force of the engine at the
draw-bar

  at the same time ii is necessary from
indicator cards showing the mean effect-
ive pressure to measure the cylinder
power of the engine in order that it may
be ascertained whether the draw-bar pull
exerted is the maximum of which the
engine is capable and what improve-
ments if any may he made in the steam
distribution that the draw-bar pull may
be increased or greater economy in the
use of steam effected

many things must be noted

  moreover by comparing the indicated
horse - power with the dynamometer
horse-power which is derived from the
draw-bar pull a significant quantity
known as eniine resistance is obtained

  this is an uncertain and variable fac-
tor and sometimes almost justifies the
engineers statement that she isnt feel-
ing just right to-day

  then in a thorough road test much
other data is necessary in order to make
a complete record of working conditions
so that certain effects may be traced to
their causes and certain causes to their
effects

  of course one of the most important
items in any locomotive test is the ac-
curate measurement of the water and
coal used

  then the draft in the smoke-box fire-
box and ash-pan is measured by means
of u-shaped glass tubes or manometers
partly filled with water i laving this
information it is usually possible to de-
tect the cause of not steaming with-
out resorting to methods known to the
engineering force as  trial and error
or to the world at large as  guess work

  the temperature of the smoke-box is
also frequently required by this meas-
urement we can estimate the waste of
heat from this source the smoke-box

gases are also sampled and afterward
analyzed

  it is better therefore to fire single
shovel  when you have a  coop  on the
front end for the testing crew is keeping
tabs on the firemans co however
this is just what a fireman does not want
to do if it is not the practise on his divi-
sion for what we arc after is average
road conditions and both fireman and
engineer had better try and forget that
we are  the engine

  then the quality or wetness of the
steam in a saturated steam-engine is ob-
tained by means of a calorimeter if
the engine has a superheater-that is a
real superheater not a  steam warmer 
-the steam is always dry then we as-
certain its temperature or superheat by
means of a thermometer thrust into aii
oil-well in the steam-chest or by an elec-
tric pyrometer the reading instrument
of which is mounted in the cab like a
steam-gage with wires leading to the
steam-chest

how the men are stationed

  to obtain all this data at least five
men are required  the engine there
are usually about four in the dyna-
mometer car although in the case of
mallets the men on the engine may he
increased to ten or more the men upon
the engine itself are stationed and
employed as shown in the table at the
bottom of page 

  all these men should have had some
locomotive experience-actually on the
road-before being allowed to act as test
observers

  it is a mistake to think they must all
be  technical  men a clever appren-
tice a valve-setter from the roundhouse
or a fireman looking for information
might make ideal observers even  in-
dicator men after a little practise
they must  feel at home   an en-
gine and they must have learned from
experience to guard against accident

  the cab observer particularly should
be a seasoned railroad man then he
will know where to sit will keep out of
the left-hand gangway and off the foot-
plate thus getting along without friction
with the crew lie will realize that he is
there  sufferance only and that he is
using some of the firemans space and
on a testing trip



some of ilie engineers patience and that
the engineer could order him to  hit the
grit if he thought it necessary to the
safe operation of the train

  with this preliminary statement of
the purpose and equipment of the test
we will go forward to the little box on
the pilot this is built entirely across
the engine when it is to shelter two in-
dicator observers and a time-log keeper
sometimes it is built only over the left
cylinder it is made of matched lumber
and strongly ironed it is necessary to
protect the men from the wind which
unobstructed would make it impossible
to carry on the work on a high-speed
engine

  in this box just ahead of the cylin-
ders with his back to the approaching
landscape sits the  indicator man 
humped over his instrument the time
observer usually acts as lookout to warn
all concerned of impending danger lie
also gives the signals for  taking cards 
at regular intervals by displaying a black-
board on which the number of the next
card and the exact time it will be taken
is chalked so that it may be noted by all
observers

  above each steam-chest in very care-
ful tests is located an indicator sup-
ported by its three-quarter-inch pipe con-
nections with each end of the cylinder
and the steam-chest

  the steam-engine indicator-which is
to an engineer what the stethoscope is to
a physician or what the microscope is
to the bacteriologist - is really a very
simple instrument

  it was invented by james watt and
its principle remains the same to-day
although it has been so refined that it
resembles its progenitor of watts time
as the modern standard watch resembles
grandfathers clock

  its use requires considerable practise
and its finer application a particular
knack which cannot be acquired by some
although others are born with it it is
a somewhat delicateinstrument and will
not stand persuasion with a monkey-
wrench

making the records

  the indicator consists of a vertical
steam-cylinder in which a piston of one-
half square inch or one square inch area
moves a small amount a piston-rod with
a lever connected to its upper end for
multiplying this movement and a card-
holder or drum revolved by the engine
cross-head upon the attached card of
which the movement of the indicator-
piston in relation to that of the engine-
piston is recorded by a pencil

  the cylinder is placed in communica-
tion with first one end and then the other
of the locomotive-cylinder by means of
a three-way cock

  as the steam from the engine-cylinder
raises the indicator-pis-ton it compresses
a carefully calibrated spring to an
amount corresponding with the pressure
in the cylinder this relative height mul-
tiplied several times is marked by means
of a pencil in the end of the multiplying
lexer on a card held by clips to the ver-

tical drum which is one and a half or
two inches in diameter

  this drum is revolved by means of a
cord fastened to a finger on the re-
ducing motion  so called because it re-
duces the motion of the cross-head
making nearly a complete turn as the
cross-head moves one way and then re-
versing its motion as the cross-head
makes the return stroke

  the combinationof the vertical move-
ment due to steam-pressure and the hori-
zontal movement due to the motion of
the cross-head traces the familiar indi-
cator diagram an example is given in
this drawing

  a is the point where steam is admitted
to the engine-cylinder as the cross-
head is nearly or quite at the end of tine
stroke and therefore stationary the
pressure mounts rapidly making a
straight vertical line to b where the for-
ward stroke begins the pressure is
maintained quite high until cut off c
then it drops as the steam expands to i
where the exhaust opens the return
or exhaust-stroke begins at e and con-
tinues to i where compression occurs
and so on over again

  diagrams from both ends are usually
taken upon one card

  the method of procedure in taking
cards is as follows

  at the preliminary warning given by
the time-log man by means of an air-
whistle or hell the operator  hooks up 
the cord starting the drum revolving
and opens the three-way cock to the
 head  end of the cylinder

  the piston starts reciprocating with
the fluctuations in pressure-up at ad-
mission and down at exhaust on re-
ceipt of a second signal he presses the
pencil lightly against the paper on the
drum by means of a small handle on the
 parallel motion  of the indicator dur-

ing one complete revolution of the
engine of more

frequency of taking cards

  he then reverses the three-way cock
to the  crank  end and takes this card
as quickly as possible probablv occu-
pying six to ten seconds for both ends
lie then traces the steam-chest line by
placing the three-way cock handle in
closed position opening a second cock
connected with the steam-chest

  next the three-way cock is opened to
the atmosphere and the atmospheric line
which forms the base for all measure-
ments of pressure is traced

  cards are taken at three five or ten-
minute intervals over the entire divi-
sion this gives almost a continuous rec-
ord of the power the engine is exerting

  the indicator operator is a very busy
man at times cords will break springs
get loose the indicator piston must be
oiled from time to time and frequently
-as when there are steam leaks about
the cylinder or a draft through the box
-it is extremely difficult to insert the
specially prepared paper cards under the
clips of the drum

  whatever happens he m list he pre-
pared for the next card when the sig-
nal is sounded as a  lost  card means
a serious break in the record  is hands
get scalded his neck gets burned by hot
cinders dropping into his collar as he
stoops he is always either half cooked
or frozen to death and when the end
of the run is reached he can scarcely
rise from his cramped position-but he
wouldnt trade his job with the lookout
in the dynamometer car whose only duty
is to hold down a cushioned stool stick
his head out the window and note the
mile-posts stations and curves

  because of his more arduous duties
he demands the best seat and usually
preempts a sufficient space on the
 divan  to stretch out at full length
while those engaged in less active occu-
pations-such as the coal observer who
lias only to empty one-hundred-pound
sacks of coal all the morning and climb
i lie tank-ladder fifty times at every water
stop-stand up

   f course allowance must be made
for the fact that of all the crew he is
possibly the only one who is an old hand
at the game the others make one test
and drift to other occupations where
testing becomes out of their line of ac-
tion-the indicator man is the only one
who  comes back

  even after lie assumes the dignity
which goes with the title  mechanical
engineer he may be unable to find a
man of sufficient experience to do the
work

  if he is one of the old school i im-
agine that he does not look very far to
find a man he just gets out the old in-
dicator the familiar  perfume  of por-
poise oil assails his nostrils he knows
how fresh the air will be about  am
down on the valley division  train 
how it will drive into his lungs as he
sticks his head above the box and how
the dewdrops will sparkle  the grass
when he looks over the big meadow at
ny tower-and be is back on the job

  yes he will run the test   and 
its hard to get up at  am but  ar-
rives in mecropolis just in time for
luncheon he will take the boys to the
grill hack of  neits and there will be
time for a game of billiards before it is
 back to overalls

  yes he tackles the job in person and
some youthful aspirant for road experi-
ence is so disappointed that he is finally
taken along to read the calorimeter

getting away from danger

  the occupation of testing locomotives
particularly on passenger runs is both
hazardous and fascinating a slight ac-
cident unknown to those back in the
coaches such as picking up a  speeder
a cow or even striking a pile of rock bal-
last heaped too high might easily prove
disastrous to the man on the front end
cvlinder-heads sometimes blow out

and indicator pipes burst and the scald-
ing steam is deadly loose car doors
are another menace to life and limb
accidents are few however probably
because tests are not run every day

   know of only one serious mishap to
an indicator man he lost both legs in
a slight butting collision he will take
no more cards but lie is  still in the
game and more useful than ever to bis
company

   am a great believer in a  lookout
on the front end to warn against dan-
ger it is often asked what good
would it do to be warned what
would you do  

  i have discovered that even  the
fastest limited trains there is time for a
live man to cover the distance from the
pilot-box to a position of quasi-safety by
straddling the boiler back of the sand-
box before meeting up with an obstruc-
tion this can be done in two move-
ments  some engines and in three on
others but they are long free lively
movements  any locomotive and the
arms come into play more than the legs

figuring the horse-power

  this  getaway glide  was once put
into practise  an extremely fast run
when the writer was working without a
lookout chancing to glance ahead 
had an impression of a wagon with a
 hay rigging  crossing the tracks in the
middle distance paying  particular
attention at first i finally noticed that it
had stopped with the rear wheels  the

the  hired man  calmly fumbling with
the lock of a field gate which barred his

  lie got it open and spoke to the team
but-

  after completing the road work of a
test the real labor begins this is the
tabulation and working up of results
from the data in the log-books

  some roads notably the pennsylvania
have a regular system with dozens of
printed forms for this work the in-
formation from each test or series of
tests by this means can be readily com-
pared with any other test which has evor
been run on the system

  one of the biggest jobs connected with
this work is figuring the indicated

horsc-powor of thousands of indicator
cards iliis work together with the
working up of the dynamometer record
will keep the lesl force busy for a longer
period than was occupied by the trip
from which the data was collected

  it is often the practise to  lay in  th 
engine every other day or to allow her
to make a run without the test force and
to work up the data on the alternate
days this method is the most popular
with all concerned for nothing is more
tedious-accustomed as they are to out-
door air and exercise-than for the boys
to be cooped up for weeks poring over
seemingly endless strings of figures

  tint everything conies to an end
even the hope that some of the trips may
have to he run over again owing to the
kick of important data-the final sum-

takes its place in the files of the motive-
power department copies being sent to
all interested parties

  the engine is found to have done all
that was claimed for her by the builders
luil opportunities are presented for
further improvements to be embodied in
the next order-perhaps a little larger
fire-box a little more cylinder clearance
additional evaporating surface or a
little less superheating surface

that the engines of the future

  in europe and other foreign
countries however they still
continue occasionally to build
an engine that embodies very
unusual features  ne of the
latest is shown in the accom-
panying illustration

  it was constructed for the
italian state railways and the
cab was placed in front that the
engineer might have the clear-
est possible view of the track
ahead it is a four-cylinder
compound with the cylinders
arranged in a peculiar manner
the two high-pressure cylinders
being on one side of the center
line and the two low-pressure
cylinders on the other coal
is carried in bunkers in the
cab though in this respect the
accommodations for fuel are
decidedly limited water is
carried in the circular tank-
tender which is fitted accord-
ing to the continental custom
with the small cab shown the
tender-cab is not occupied
when running when in opera-
tion the engine presents a very
strange appearance for while
it is actually running forward
the action of the driving-
wheels would be considered
backward in this country the
engine seems to run backward
to go forward


 cumberland valleys first engine

old slab-track locomotive could make sixty miles an hour with only

                      one man in the cab

it was sixty years ago that seth wil-
marth a boston inventor designed
and constructed the  kitty did
which at the time attracted unusual at-
tention in railroad circles

  the engine was the first used on the
cumberland valley railroad it was placed
in regular service between chanibersburg
and harrisburg pennsylvania a distance
of fifty-two miles where it rendered
efficient service it continued in active
service for twenty-nine years

  during the civil war the  kittv did 
figured prominently in hauling federal
soldiers and when chanibersburg was
burned this locomotive pioneer made a
remarkable escape from the conflagration
it is one of the few pioneer engines still
in existence

  a short time after w illiam lladlev of
fngland built a flat car to ascertain the
adhesion of an iron wheel  an iron rail
being sufficient to enable a locomotive to
pull any load the  kitty did  made its

appearance and demonstrated conclu-
sively the practicability of locomotive con-
struction

  paradoxical as it may seem the kitty
did  had a remarkable record for speed
this antique locomotive is accredited of
having attained a speed of sixty miles an
hour under favorable conditions its last
run was from carlisle to chanibersburg
pennsylvania in 

  the engine has two cylinders ja x

moving a bridge or car-trucks

moving on trucks to a new berth the big steel riildge of the missouri pacific

that spans the kansas river

twelve men cut loose a railroad bridge spanning the kansas river

and move it  feet

during the past year many remark-
able engineering feats have been ac-
complished in the construction of the
new union depot and terminal facilities in
kansas city missouri one of the most
unusual of the many tasks thus far accom-
plished was the raising and removal of the
railroad bridges of the kansas or kaw
river in one instance a dozen men raised
a bridge five hundred and forty feet long
and moved it twenty-seven feet down the
river a few days later another party of
men moved the entire structure over one
hundred feet toward the east bank the
steel work alone weighed one thousand five
hundred tons

  resides the changes necessitated by the
plans for the new terminal the construc-
tion of dikes along the west bank of the
kansas river made it necessary to raise and
lengthen half a dozen traffic bridges

  the first structure to be moved was the
missouri pacific railway bridge made fa-
mous bv the flood of  when ii was the

only bridge that was not carried away by
the violent waters the structure was saved
by the weight of fifteen heavy engines
which were placed on it that it might with-
stand the rushing river

  under the direction of s m rate the
work of moving the big bridge was begun
in september  when the new piers and
necessary cribbing were begun not until
april of this year were the contractors
ready to begin the actual work of moving
the huge structure

  on the evening of april  traffic across
the structure was completely suspended anil
 the following morning the tracks at
either end of the bridge were parted

  the bridge had been raised and placed
upon a large number of car-trucks and with
heavy stationary engines furnishing the
motive-power the big span was hauled to
its new site only a dozen men were re-
quired to make the move the lateral
movement of one hundred and twenty feet
was a comparatively simple task

 
just one life

by george van schaick

   sue was willing to wager her money but
   joe was unwilling to risk his future

        he superintendent of the
          salmon hatchery was a
          mighty interesting man but
          joe thinking of the girl
          rose and knocked the ashes
          from his pipe

   tis wonderful about all that life on
earth he commented

   yes said the young man in spec-
tacles  codfish for instance will av-
erage a million eggs and the sea s full
of other fish just as prolific if a dozen
from each spawning could reach adult
age the sea and its putrefying waters
would overrun the land where constant
destruction is also the price of life

   think of men a fraction more
than one dies for every beat of your
pulse something like five for every
breath you draw youre thirty and
since you were bcrn three-quarters of a
billion of men women and children
have gone to make room for others

   lifes an awful big thing and also
very little said joe  well so-long 

  he took the long path by the river
that roared in the wearing of boulders
and grinding them to sand with crashing
waves as cruel as the fierce jaws of mon-
strous things beneath the sea of which
the superintendent had been speaking

  while he walked on stolidly as the
dusk was gathering a young man met a
girl in the main street of the little village

   you promised that you would wait
for me  he exclaimed excitedly

   joe is a better man for all that your
people own the mill she answered
drawing up her pretty head  ive
finished with waiting and with having
folks talking youve been scared at

 rr	r

telling your people theyd know all
about it if they lived here i aint good
enough for them and now im going to
marry one of my own kind hes good
joe is

   i wish you joy with your lumber-
jack he sneered

  hes twice the man you are she
cried angrily

  harry browns laugh goaded her to
greater excitement some of the mill
hands idling in the street strolled to-
ward them attracted by her bitter voice

   whats the matter havin a family
row already why dont you two wait
till youre married   asked a big fore-
man in mackinaws with the easy fa-
miliarity of iumber camps

   marry him   cried the girl  im
going to marry a man i am im going
to marry joe ive told him so hes
the best man of you all he is best in
the mill and best  the river-and you
know it

   sure the only real man as ever rode
a log jested the foreman

   hed have  trouble beatin you at
it retorted the girl contemptuously

   course not put in a bystander
 he could go down dog rapids on a
spruce butt a playin of his accordeon
with one hand and throwin kisses with
the other

  the guffaws that greeted this sally ex-
asperated the girl

   he could ride the rapids anyway
she cried  and thats more than any
of you would dare

   youre a dead game sport aint you
susie put in a third man what
you bettin he can ride a log down  


railroad mans magazine

  with quivering lips eyes flashing
cheeks mantled with red the girl drew
from her waist a roll of money and
shook it in the mans face

   i got a hundred dollars here  she
cried  joe gave it to me to buy the
tilings for our house there aint one
of you dares bet 

  her discarded suitor promptly pulled
a bill-fold from his pocket

   ive got a hundred here that says he
cant do it  he exclaimed

  the big foreman grew serious with
one hand he grasped the girls arm

   hold on put back that money
sue youre goin too far theres no
one got a right to gamble on a mans
life

   its a long time since browns mills
bad any excitement put in the young
man raspingly  id like to treat them
to a circus

   now you sure dont mean that
harry said the foreman  you know
it aint right 

   what are you butting in for  re-
sented young brown

  the big mans jaws gritted but he
kept still

   ill stick to the bet cried the girl
stamping her foot  ill show you the
kind of man im going to marry

  by this time a small crowd had as-
sembled the postmaster who pipe in
hand had strolled out of his little store
became an unwilling holder of the
money some began to bet small sums
on the event while others quarreled as
to the feasibility of riding the rapids or
stood by hushed staring wordless as if
in the presence of impending tragedy

  quietly and with the smile that seldom
left his honest face joe moore came
down the street and scratched his neck
as he came near men stepped aside to
make room for him they looked at
him in a silence that was growing
painful

  hello he said fine evenin
aint it twont be no time to hot
weather now for the black flies is biting
in the woods daytime and my neck is
all mosquito bit there aint a mite of
ice left in the river and salmon are run-
nin hello sue  

  for a moment he was puzzled at the
stillness of the usually talkative crowd

   anythin been happenin  he asked

  finally a man spoke

   youve gone an lost a hundred dol-
lars joe he said

   me i didnt have but a quarter in
my pocket when i left and there it is
suddenly an idea came to him

    p yu g and lose that money
sue   he asked  ive a notion you
did by the looks of you pshaw some-
bodyll be bringin it back less you
dropped it in the river but dont you
worry sue for  got some more down
to the savin-bank at lakeville guess
it worries you more than me but it dont
make no real difference to speak of

   shes been telling us what a big man
you are joe put in harry brown
 and insisted on betting me a hundred
that you would ride dog rapids on a
log

   i got the money put in the post-
master sheepishly  and i wish twas out
of my hands dont you be a fool joe
susie here she got excited and a bit
foolish for a moment im glad you can
do witlrout that money for i guess
youve lost it all right

   oh give it back to him if lies got
cold feet said harry brown

  joe looked at him with a surprised
stare as if he did not quite understand
but was trying hard to

  is that right sue he asked
 there aint no kind of a catch or a
joke to it is there i was always
reckoned a bit slow when it come to
guessin things

   take your man for a walk sue
sneered brown  and take your money
back too i dont care for it and an-
other time you wont talk quite so big
 joe  joe  show them what you
can do the girl burst out  i told them
that you were braver than any of them
and i know you are if you dont try
theyll never end laughing at us 

   i reckon theres somethin to that
joe admitted  a mans life aint but a
little mite of a thing and its tough
feedin to eat crow guess ill risk it
all right dye know ive sometimes
had a notion it could be done leastways
when the water wasnt quite so high
sooner we try it sooner itll be over a
good time would be after noon-whistle
to-morrow

   i need new calks to my boots im
thinkin and ill go put some in good
just one life



and sharp theres plenty good straight
butts in the boom at the mill and ill
pick one out first thing in the morning
 got a fine settin-pole smooth and not
a knot in it getlin kind of late aint
it guess ill say good night folks we
wont go walkin sue count of my hav-
in to look after them boots

  he walked oft in his strong quiet
gait nodding good-humoredly to friends
once within his little room he smoked
his pipe peacefully while he drove new
calks sharp as needles in the heavy
soles of his river-boots

   life he told himself  from all ac-
counts dont amount to much theres
piles and piles of it that dont come to
anythin seems to me

  he critically inspected his boots to his
entire satisfaction and a few moments
later went to bed

   i understand you harry said joe
next day standing on the river-bank and
looking quietly at the turmoil beyond
of course i reckon its plumb foolish
but i guess sues heart is set on it and
theres been so much talk id better see
it through  dont bear you no grudge
but ill say i think youve been kind of
hard on the girl and took some advan-
tage of her being that quick in temper
an proud

  he was looking at brown placidly
and before his steady glance the younger
mans eves fell then joe turned away
from him nodding quietly to his friends
-the teamsters gang-sawyers scalers
and the flume-tender who had run down
as soon as the shrill mill-whistle shrieked
the noon-hour

  susie came to him conscious of an
undercurrent of public disapproval
wherefore she walked boldly with head
erect in the flush of pride her hands
tightlv clenched to check their trembling

   be careful joe she said  be very
careful and well show them yet

  the mans features slowly expanded
into a smile but he only nodded

   twont take long was all he an-
swered

  then his slow movements seemed to
shed away from him like a discarded
garment and he became catlike in mo-
tion the long logs butt was grinding
in the dead water on a bit of gravelly
shore as he leaped upon it

  a hard slow gradual push of the
iron-shod pole and the sprucc-trunk was
afloat in the peaceful eddying reach be-
low the dam beyond the white waters
frothed swished on and curled

  men watched with beating hearts
women looked then hid their eyes some
children cried others were laughing

  joe was paddling with his pole keenly
looking ahead paying not the slightest
heed to the crowd that edged the banks
and was preparing to run along and fol-
low his course

  the log soon gathered speed and
presently the end rose high over the
crest of a wave joe was birling it as it
began to spin beneath his feet balancing
himself with the pole then like a horse
taking the bit in its teeth the log surged
ahead faster and faster through a grue-
some turmoil of black rocky heads show-
ing above the sudding flood

   he aint near enough inshore cried
a man

   yes he is the waves are too high
at the end of the black water  yelled
another

   hes down  roared the crowd

  the end of the log had butted a rock-
head  the after-coming flood uplifted
the rear it bucked like a wild mustang
and joe slipped into the caldron

  but-in a moment despite the force
that tore at him he was astride again
the pole still in his left hand

  while the mob was shrieking he took
advantage of a bit of dead water and
in another second again stood erect on
the log instantaneously he was again
in the toils tossed and shaken but al-
ways speeding toward wilder billows so
that some of the men running along the
river fell exhausted and their number
dwindled as they sped on panting

  another collision with a rock nearly
threw joe again but he recovered his
balance though for a moment the log
sank till he was waist-deep but the
new calks held and once more he tore
on toward the great ridge of white water
passing over the ledge

   he cant do it  shouted a piler be-
tween sobbing breaths

  for a moment he birled as the log be-
gan to roll then with a tremendous
sweep of his pole joe aimed it straight
at the wall of roaring waters he seemed
to disappear in the spume


railroad mans magazine

  after a breathless second they saw
him rushing again still erect a figure
heroic presently the waters flowed
more gently into the broad pool of dead
water and he was slowly poling toward
the shore

  howling men leaped into the water
eager to help him ashore then they
 bore him up the bank while he sought
to escape their hugging

    let me go boys he said  i can
walk and aint hurt none outside a
scratch  got when i went in any one
got a plug i reckon mine washed cut
of my pocket

  they handed him tobacco and a knife
and he quietly cut away a pipeful after
lie hail shaken himself like a wet dog
people were still coming fast eager to
grasp his hand put they made room
when sue arrived

  what cared she for the crowd now
she probably did not see it as she threw
herself upon the man

   look out sue im soakin wet i
aint hurt none he said puffing at his
pipe  i aint savin as id like to try
again just sit down on this here rock
an get your breath

  harry brown came up very pale
will you take my hand he asked
 im sorry for my share in this

   joe laughed

    whats the odds lad  he answered
 were all right side up now

  the whistle was shrieking again and
the men started back in leisurely fashion
knowing that the timekeeper would be
lenient that day finally the girl and the
man were left alone

    think i better go back an shift my
clothes he said  this wind is travel-
in through these wet rags i just despise
to go through the village lookin like
such a scarecrow

  but sue was telling of her pride in
him how he was greater than all others
a wonderful being in her eyes as they
walked along in the village joe was
distinctly embarrassed folks came out
of the store and the blacksmith shop and
the cook at the boarding-house waved a
pan at him and yelled

    its all right boys an i reckon i had
more luck than brains he said  just
lot me run up and put on dry things
the girl stood on the veranda people
looked at her curiously

   what arc you staring at  she asked
  told you id show you the kind of
man i was going to marry

  after quite a long time joe came down
in his black suit of sunday clothes his
best blue shirt and a paper collar in
one hand he bore a voluminous grip-
sack

  sue looked at him amazed

   where you going joe  she asked

   guess im bound for lakeville

   what for

  slowly he sat on the steps of the porch
and fumbled at his pipe with his jack-
knife she sat beside him something
was clutching at her breast and hurting

   you got no notion what a little time
it takes one to think he said musingly
 when i was travelin right smart on
that log i got to thinkin real hard a
man aint got but one life and that aint
hardly worth anythin youd just won-
der to know the millions thats getting
snuffed out all the time

   but just that one little life looms up
kind of big when a mans scrappin for it
and the only thing that can make it still
bigger is love i reckon now  mistrust
i better go back to lakeville because i
got a notion that real love just naturally
couldnt bear the idea of the other one
gettin hurted

   you didnt feel that way sue so i
take it you was mistaken just honestly
mistaken and one cant afford to make
mistakes going through them kinds of
rapids and-and the trains making up
to go now so ill say good-by if you
dont mind

  he stood up and watched her kindly
for a moment

  the girls fingers contracted ami her
nails dug into the soft folds of her dress
her eves sought the mans-face but the
mist blinded them then came a groping
gesture of one hand which joe perhaps
misunderstood

   well so-long he said and turned
away with his slow sturdy step he
passed into the gathering darkness while
the girl suddenly became flaccid and
limply fell

  her pretty head rested on her bent arm
on one of the steps and for a kindly
minute life and love and all great and
small things of the world that bring
agony and happiness were blotted from
her knowledge

-order of railroad telegraphers

the initiative of a d thurston a lone operator
unites the railroad telegraphers into a power-
ful army of over  workers

by thaddeus s dayton

-punning trains is like a gi-
gantic game of chess the
gjjjht board covers the whole
country the trains are
the pawns nearly 
telegraph - operators move
the pieces in the game they are matched
against one opponent-time the con-
test never ends but the men at the keys
render the time-card dependable with-
out the incessant vigilance of the opera-
tors all would be chaos

  the players in this mighty game must
remember innumerable moves once in
a while a despatcher suffers a lapse of
memory and places two pieces on the
same square such errors are far more
infrequent than they once were tele-
graph-operators are more efficient and
less liable to err than they were twenty
or thirty years ago

  there are many reasons for this but
most of them can be traced to the order
of railroad telegraphers when that

association was organized in  it
sowed the seed from which sprang a
great deal more than its own individual
benefit the public in general does not
even faintly realize the part that this
order has played in making railroad
travel safer in the last quarter of a
century

  a d thurston was the founder of the
order of railroad telegraphers most
of the railroad mans organizations have
been founded by a small group of indi-
viduals no single one of whom stands
out prominently with the telegraphers
it was different no one has ever denied
the honor due to thurston

  it was thurston who originated the
idea he called the first handful of mem-
bers together and placed the association
on a working basis through the years
when it was struggling for existence
thurston guided the order with all the
skill and tenacity of purpose that a sea
captain shows when he stands watch

sleepless through days and nights of
storm and brings his boat safely into
port to-day thurston rests from his
labors rewarded with the profound re-
spect of the members of the order

  the first sixteen years of the orders
existence were stormy ami discouraging
it was not until  that it seemed to
be a success it has more than doubled
in membership since then about ninety
per cent of the despatchers telegraphers
station-agents interlockers lever-men
and other eligibles in the united states
and canada belong to it it has paid
nearly  in death claims and has
in its treasury a surplus approaching
 the average wage paid to
operators is more than double what it
was when the order was founded

  a	d thurston was the operator and
station-agent at la torte city iowa in
 he was an expert telegrapher
and understood his railroad duties thor-
oughly he was paid thirty-five dollars
a month there were thousands like him
in the rank and file of the railroad army
thurston was more fortunate than many
for la porte city was an attractive place
in the center of a rich farming country
and the work was not excessive although
the hours were exceedingly long

thurston makes first move

  thurston had worked where he had
been almost as solitary as a sheep-herder
he labored on the deserts and on bleak
mountainsides where two passenger-
trains a day went by between midnight
and morning he knew from experience
all that there was to know about being
agent and operator at a small station
liie drawbacks were the small pay and
the long hours even with strict econo-
my thirty-five dollars a month in a small
town do not exceed the cost of the neces-
saries of life thurston did not mind
the responsibilities of the position for
he was accustomed to obey orders and to
act quickly and effectively  his own
judgment

  thurston had time to ponder these
things day after day and night after night
as he sat at his key he talked over the
wire with operators up and down the line
it is as natural for operators to talk with
each other in this way as it is for a group
of persons seated around a stove in a

country store to exchange ideas and
gossip

  thurston found as he sounded the
men here and there that all of them felt
that the working conditions of the craft
were so intolerable and the wages so low
that they should seek for a remedy no
one however seemed to have any clear
idea of what to do xone was willing to
take the initiative

  it was a difficult matter in those days
to create such an organization as seemed
necessary the idea was comparatively
new and the obstacles seemed insur-
mountable but thurston with the exe-
cutive ability and singleness of purpose
that characterized his subsequent con-
nection with the order was not to be
discouraged he finally drew up a plan
it was complete in every detail his idea
was a labor organization with possibly
the mutual benefit feature as a side issue

twenty-eight at first meeting

  he explained many times to the other
operators by wire most of them clicked
back that it was too good ever to come
true that he had better abandon his
dream for it never would be realized
thurston continued to urge and argue
and finally convinced twenty-eight oper-
ators that he was right the next step
was to call a meeting

  cedar rapids iowa was selected as
the meeting-point and sunday june
 was the day chosen cedar rapids
was quite a railroad center at that time
and most of the twenty-eight telegra-
phers could reach it without difficulty
several of them had their headquarters
there

  the meeting was held and the order
of railroad telegraphers was created
it did not take long because the details
had been thoroughly arranged even
the official organ the railroad teleg-
rapher had been planned and its cost
and prospective revenue carefully esti-
mated

  there were no interlocking system of
signals no telephones or other innova-
tions in those days the telegraph was
supreme in the movement of trains
therefore when the order was founded
only railroad telegraph-operators were
admitted to membership

  there was  rush to join the new
ties that bind



order for the next ten years it seemed
as if every member was won by per-
sistent individual argument every new
member had to be filled with the enthusi-
asm of the original founders so that he
might become a magnet to attract others
there were no paid organizers traveling
from place to place each new member
solicited his friends by wire when an
operator is convinced that he is right
his morse becomes as emphatic as his
speech

popular wtih railroads

  if it was difficult to secure new mem-
bers it was still harder to improve the
working conditions and increase wages
the members who headed the commit-
tees were admirably persistent the
railroad officials were prompt to see that
these men were intelligent and capable
and had a reasonable basis for the de-
mands the executives might differ with
them but there was no discourtesy 
either side thus it has come about that
the heads of the order of railroad
telegraphers have ready access to those
in charge of the railroads

  during the first decade of its existence
the order had the usual vicissitudes pe-
culiar to such associations there were
victories and defeats discouragement
and elation but finally system began to
come out of chaos and the order found
itself

  in  it had but  members
only a small percentage of those who
were eligible it gained only eighty-one
members in the next year in those that
followed the growth was steady but not
especially rapid when the possible extent
of the organization is considered in
 it had  members the next
year it gained nearly  the next more
than  since then the membership
has been increasing steadily hard
times and lack of employment were ob-
stacles but work and wages gave it a
new impetus the following tabulation
of membership tells the story

  it is expected that the membership
will reach  this year there are
 local divisions of the order sixteen
of them being in canada which includes
those in prince edward island and
nova scotia some of these divisions
are very large division no  covers the
union pacific railroad system its gen-
eral chairman being located in denver
and no  with headquarters at welland
ontario takes in the canadian pacific
division no  covers the new york
central and is subdivided into a number
of smaller divisions this is also the
case with most of the other large rail-
ways such as the b and o the c and
o the illinois central the big four
and the delaware and hudson

 added to pay-rolls

  the order has wage-scales and sched-
ule agreements in force  nearly all the
railroads in this country and in canada
it is constantly adding to them in 
it completed seventy-eight successful
schedule negotiations which was the
largest number during any year of its
history some of these agreements were
new and some were revisions of those
already in existence they represented
an addition of more than  to
the pay-rolls of the telegraphers in the
united states and canada

  the order now admits eight classes of
railroad employees to membership -
telegraphers train-despatchers agents
located at railroad-stations line-repair-
ers lever-men or interlockers tower or
train-directors telephone-operators and
staffmen

  a mutual benefit department for the
purpose of furnishing death benefits for
members was regularly instituted in
 previous to that time it was op-
tional with the local organizations many
of which had sick and many other bene-
fits that seemed to make membership in
the order desirable

  the death benefits of the order are
divided into three classes the smallest

amount is  on which the annual as-
sessment is twenty cents a month  the
next is  which costs thirty cents
monthly the highest  costs

scattered it consists of a o sinks

  both president perham and secretary
and treasurer quick have held their re-
spective positions for a number of years
mr quick two or three years ago was
elected city treasurer of st louis it is
a democratic municipality and mr quick
ran on the republican ticket but was so
popular that he won by a large majority
he was also editor and manager of the
railroad telegrapher for many years

  membership is certificate of efficiency

  such things may seem trivial to the
general reader but they are of great im-
portance to the order the average
telegrapher has not only traveled widely
but he has a large circle of acquaintances
he may never have seen many of the
people he knows but he has talked with
them many times over the wire and
knows their  morse  just as surely as
he would their handwriting therefore
in a big family of nearly  every
item of news is of utmost interest

  the ladies auxiliary of the order held
its first biennial and second regular ses-
sion at toronto canada in may 
it is a young organization but already
has more than twenty lodges in different
parts of the country and a large number
of members to lend moral support to
the order and to form social centers
wherever there are many operators are
the chief objects of the organization

  in the matter of increasing wages the
order of railroad telegraphers has been
very successful in  the usual pay
for an agent and operator was thirty or
thirty-five dollars a month now 
many roads the minimum paid to oper-
ties that bind



ators is fifty dollars a month and com-
petent men get from sixty to one hundred
dollars a month through the efforts of
the order the nine-hour law was enacted
several years ago on many lines since
then the order has been successful in
its negotiations to reduce the working
day to eight hours

  the order has set high standards of
efficiency for those who belong to it
they must be capable and experienced
men membership in the order is now
regarded by nearly all the railways as
a certificate of ability and trustworthi-
ness

must never make a mistake

  if the unforeseen never came to pass
on a railroad it would not be necessary
that train-despatchers and the operators
towermen and others on the line all of
whom are connected by the slender wire
that parallels the tracks should be such
skilled and dependable men if no train
ever was delayed if there were no extra
trains no accidents-if everything fol-
lowed the theory of perfect railroading-
the telegraph-operators would be un-
necessary

  but emergencies arise every hour
trains are delayed by many causes and
their schedule must be rearranged from
moment to moment without the tele-
graph this would be impossible that
is why the train-despatchers and the op-
erators are so vital to railroading

  the public hears little of the train-
despatcher and knows less about him
he is a high type of railroad official who
works in obscurity but on him the safety
of trains rests with the heaviest re-
sponsibility he must never make a mis-
take he knows that each message he
sends must be as certain as fate itself
that the change of a single letter or fig-
ure may produce disaster

  the despatcher comes from the ranks
of telegraphers his knowledge of rail-
road operation both theoretical and prac-
tical must be as nearly perfect as is
possible there are great telegraph-oper-
ators and great despatchers just as there
are great generals or great railway presi-
dents it is the emergency always that
tests when all is well any despatcher
can control train movements but when
storms demoralize the line when there

is a deluge of unexpected traffic when
there is a wreck or a derailment then the
sheer genius of the men at the key
becomes apparent

  train-sheet is despatchers domain

  the despatcher is monarch of more
than he surveys and is a ruler whose
word is absolute the train-sheet be-
fore him is the map of his kingdom and
his subjects are the conductors the engi-
neers the signal-men and all the rest
who are concerned in moving the trains
and in keeping the pathway clear for
them me is like the silent figure on the
bridge of a great ship in his mind is a
picture-map which shows distinctly every
mile of the line under his control every
siding every cut and fill and bridge and
every train that is speeding over the rails

  the train-despatcher is the lord of the
 power as the railroad men call the
locomotives one who is unfamiliar
with such sights passing from the
despatchers office to the roundhouse
where the great engines are stabled finds
powerful stimulant for the imagination
in the despatchers office at night all is
brilliantly lighted there is a continuous
rattle of telegraph instruments the men
who sit at the keys are intensely ab-
sorbed in their work

  in the roundhouse there is neither
brilliant illumination nor much noise
the great engines arrive and depart pa-
tient sleepless mighty some are the
lean racers that dash with the limiteds
others are big and brawny freight-
engines they await the despatchers
orders the sheets of tissue that are
scanned so carefully because they are the
result of every possible precaution
against error and accident

  the train glides out onto the line
warned by wire the men in the towers
set the signals the first order from the
despatcher directs the train to proceed to
a certain point and specifies carefully
every other train regular or extra that
it will meet and the point where they
should meet and pass as soon as the
train reaches the end of its orders others
await it and so it proceeds to the end of
the journey not infrequently at some
lonely way-station it is halted by a sig-
nal and the operator hands out orders
canceling those already issued


railroad mans magazine

  the ceremony of the train-order seems
bewildering to the outsider but is a sort
of human interlocking system it places
the responsibility unerringly on some
individual during the run each man
knows not only what his own duties are
but the duties of the others who are also
concerned if he fails to obey he knows
that disaster is probable therefore for
his own honor he must be alert

  it is this interdependence that binds
railroad telegraphers with such strong
and intimate ties they live in an atmos-
phere where names and faces count for
nothing in the making of friendships
where personality is insensibly communi-
cated by the wire they are widely sep-
arated in a physical sense but yet are
brought into the closest touch and sympa-
thy by an electric current

  that is why the order of railroad

telegraphers is one of the most effective
of the great organizations no matter
where a man is located it does not take
long for every one on his circuit to know
him a man puts much of his real self
into his telegraph-key

  if he is in good spirits his morse shows
it if he is dull and sluggish the key
betrays him

  the railroad telegrapher is a fine type
nervous quick accurate mentally alert
it is no wonder that so many of the prizes
of the railway service have gone to those
who began at the key in a lonely station
far out on the line there are at least
half a score of railway presidents who
have belonged to the order and hundreds
of other men high in the railroad world
still maintain their connection with the
organization which they entered in the
early days of their careers

relics of james watt housed

 an interesting presentation was made
at manchester england when mr
george tangve presented to the cor-
poration a unique collection of relics of
watt the inventor of the steam-engine
boulton the partner of watt and mur-
dock his ablest assistant the collection
consisted of a large number of mounted
and unmounted drawings and letters dating
from  from the engineers named as
well as from many other leading men in the
latter part of the eighteenth century there
were also a variety of models including
watts engine indicator murdocks rotary
engine and pump section of newcomer
engine with several cases of drawing in-
struments an interesting letter of watts
addressed to the abbe de calonne dated
 was in many ways as applicable to
events transpiring to-day as when written
 years ago mr tangye also presented

 toward the proper housing of the
relics in a suitable room of the public
library the lord mayor presented a suit-
able resolution thanking mr tangye for
his generous gifts and stated that the
gifts were peculiarly gratifying to the citi-
zens of birmingham where boulton 
watts works were located and where the
steam-engine first came into practical util-
ity it will be recalled that mr tangye is
a member of the distinguished engineering
family whose work especially in hydro-
static machinery made many advances in
applied science among the earlier opera-
tions the launching of the great eastern

origin of the word engine

the latin word ingcnium which signi-
fies heart mind abilities or genius
was originally applied to any me-
chanical device or contrivance of an in-
genious or complicated character tn the
course of time the word became anglicized
into  engine and those who operated me-
chanical appliances were called  engi-
neers numerous machines have got their
names from a corruption or abbreviation of
the word engine as for instance gin jinny
etc but of late years the name has been

applied almost exclusively to prime movers
 locomotive which is now used to de-
note locomotive engine was first applied
in the sense now generally used through
george stephenson naming one of bis first
engines  locomotion the word was ex-
pressive and convenient and soon came into
popular use some slight deviations from
the word were common in early days  be
norris locomotive works when first es-
tablished announced that they intended
building locomotives

a way-bill of words

a jasper from out arkansaw way flew the home-coop when he reached
tlie age of thirty in order to see what the rest of the world looked like
his means of egress was an empty freight which ultimately bumped him
into chicago after watching the masonic temple revolve on its axis and
lamping the other wonders of that great city friend jasper got a fit of the blues
and decided to go back home so he wandered to the big freight yards where
the rattlers were lined up but there were so many he couldnt tell toward
which point of the compass any of the trains were heading seeing a friend-
ly-looking bo hard by he asked

     howdy stranger where can i jump a train for arkansaw

      well foxy replied the rambler  theres a stringer over there ask him
and if he cant tell you ask that hog on the iron-horse if then you are minus
the information just mope over to the snakes by the snake-house if they re-
fuse to tell you ask that eagle-eye on yonder rogers mule if you dont find
out from him spiel over to the snipes and if-

    but the bo was talking to empty air jasper was beating it down the
track suddenly a yard detective stopped him

     where are you going  he asked showing his star

     im on my way to arkansaw said jasper

    are you going to run all the way asked the detective

      no replied the innocent rube  im going to catch a freight

    the other man threw back his shoulders heaved a deep sigh and blurted
out  do you know that im the bull here get out of these yards 

    lasper took the shortest cut to freedom as he reached the limits of the
yards he encountered a bunch of boes eating a dry combination he was in-
vited to join the feast but sore at heart he kept  his way

     i guess you dont want anything to do with us because were a bunch of
cats said one of the boes with a touch of feeling

    this was too much for jasper turning he replied  strangers im from
arkansaw-and back i go for t fear my brain is impaired i thought i was in
a railroad yard but guess i must be in a south american jungle before im
taken for an elephant and shot ill just get out

    the reason for this perfectly harmless yarn may be found in another page

rests solely with you-our readers dos the railroad-worker use slang does
it jar your cultured mind if we print railroad slang in these pages

beg to differ words are created by a people because they are needed one
age will discard many of the words of the age that preceded it and put
new words in their place in this way many new words-some of them only
slang-are taken bodily into the language and recorded as first-class lexicog-
raphy in time they become useful grammatical words even the worthy bill
shakespeare frequently put slang in his plays in order to emphasize a point

    so far as railroad slang is concerned there are many words and expres-
sions that are more elegant than otherwise an engineer was called an  eagle-
eye   the presumption that his eye is as keen as that of the king of birds
nothing could be more complimentary

    the slang of the railroaders is picturesque its use lends an element of
humor that would otherwise be missing and humor creates laughter and laugh-
ter enlarges the heart stirs up the vital regions of the body expands the lungs
and prevents disease beware of the man who has no sense of mirth

    the railroaders are not alone creators and users of slang you will hear it
in the army and the navy in law and in medicine in the bank and on the bourse
however shall we flag it that is the question its up to you
we have just taken aboard a number of big things for the next years
literary way-bills we regard the list as the biggest and best bunch of articles
and stories that this magazine has had in the six years of its existence only
a few can we mention 

the bureau of standards and the railways	locomotives of moderate weight

the famous eddy clocks	confessions of a hobo

transportation on the top of the world	stories of the railroad battles with indians

the railway business association	the lost and found department

locomotive wheel loads and the mallet type stories of telegraph operators

how railroad spikes are made	with the traveling engineer

modern railroad apprentice schools	the engineer of tests

electric locomotives their cost and mainte- the boiler makers dangerous work

  nance	little fellows of the roundhouse

experiences of a chief despatcher	the engine despatcher

famous underground railways	the origin of  bradshaw

conditions for railroad men at panama	why the states regulate railways

railroad men who won carnegie medals	old-timer stories

building operations of the canadian railways tales of the roundhouse

british railways from an american point of true stories

  view	famous train robbers

    these are only a few of the subjects last july we tried the experi-
ment of making the railroad mans magazine a bigger better more valuable
publication and we raised the price to  cents a copy seventy-five per cent
of the letters we receive contain the statement that the writer would gladly
pay double the present price and buy the magazine twice a month

    but we do not intend to increase the price again we do intend however
to improve the magazine more and more and your critical observation of its
contents will always be a help to that end

to have them that we might emerge from
ignorance into the full clear light of intelli-

justice to president w s carter

in the history of the brotherhood of loco-
motive firemen and enginemen which
appeared in the august number we stated that
at the twelfth biennial convention in st paul
in june  mr a w hawley was elected
grand president of the order this was an
error and we wish to make this apology to
mr w s carter for mr carter and not mr
hawley is the chief of the brotherhood mr
hawley is the grand secretary and treasurer

  mr carter was chosen president by the
columbus convention in  and since that
time the brotherhood has enjoyed a period of
unsurpassed prosperity this correction is
made to give mr carter his place as the effi-
cient leader of a most worthy organization

  the omission was extremely regrettable in-
advertently we neglected to do full justice to
mr carters able administration of the
brotherhoods affairs his election four years
ago marked the inception of a period of re-
markable growth and success

  in  the brotherhood of locomotive
firemen and enginemen had  members
on june   there were  members a
gain of  in  the insurance depart-
ment paid  not  as we stated
in  the insurance department paid -
 in   in  to june
 this department paid i--  i
the columbus convention paid to members
whose claims did not come within the law
 in  the st paul convention
delegated to the board of directors the au-
thority to pass upon such claims as did not
come within the law and this class of mem-
bers received at the convention and during
the remainder of the year   in

	 in  to june  

  on june i  there was in the grand lodge
treasury  on june   the

insurance fund amounted to -- the
grand lodge treasury totaled  a
gain of  in four years

 through the protective department which
has to do with labor the firemen  nearly all
western railways in the united states and
canada have secured substantial increases in
pay and better working conditions during the
past four years the firemen in the east are
to follow the engineers with a request for in-
creases in wage and better working conditions
a conference will take place as soon as nego-
tiations with the engineers are concluded

  much of this success is due directly to the
progressiveness and energy of mr carter-
progressiveness and energy that should be
adequately appreciated

worth a second thought

mr e hadra of dallas texas makes
a suggestion which seems to merit the
consideration of railroad companies and rail-
road workers mr liadra thinks that it would
protect both the passenger and the employee
if the companies were to equip all trains with
emergency cases for use in the event of acci-
dents and consequent injuries

  in a letter to us mr hadra says that most
of our railroad accidents occur where it is
very difficult to secure speedy medical atten-
tion and this loss of time very often makes
serious injuries of those which if given
prompt first aid might not result gravely

 the emergency case need not be so elabo-
rately equipped that it would entail enormous
expense a sufficient supply of cotton band-
ages washes and lotions for dressing wounds
is all that is necessary

 we gladly commend mr hadras sugges-
tion to the attention of railroad surgeons

which you headed shall we flag it
has hit the nail very squarely on the head
for seven years i have associated with rail-

the only ones whom i have heard use slang
were kids just on their first job and boomers

  as you have printed in your pages many
times the true statement that railroad men
are as gentlemanly in speech and manners as
are men employed in other vocations why not
put into their mouths such words as they ac-
tually do use among themselves instead of an
argot which tends to create a false impression
of these men among the many non-railroad
readers of this magazine why not  am
sure we would all appreciate it

  and  think that you have already made 
start in the right direction the general tone
of the magazine has vastly improved in the
last year or so and if this continues you wiil
worthily represent the vast army of railroad
men and become as much of an institution
among them as are their various organizations

never dropped the red-board nor pulled one
    up on high

never failed to stop and look wheneer a train
    went by

never flagged a crossing nor worked the
    crossing gate
	railroad mans magazine

never worked on platforms never did truck
   freight

never worked in roundhouse in office or in
    yard

never put a seal on and never marked a card

never saw a railroad man but what  liked his
    style

and never have  found one without his sunny
    smile

i thought id like to know them but did not
    know the way

but the railroad mans magazine  chanced
   to see one day

i picked it up and read it through-its smiles
    its thrills its tears

and  havent missed a copy in nearly seven
    years

every month i read it through the stories one
    and all-

well i must leave you now old pal-ive got
    the board hy ball

-tickets

 by e a boyden

the stars looked cold from the wintry sky
on the  fast express  as it thundered
by

with unchecked speed a modest station
where they sometimes flag the accom-
modation

light and warmth and comfort within
peeped through the frosty windows so thin
jokes and laughter mirth and smiles

kept time to the clink of the train for miles

manhoods strength and the tender and fair
and childhoods innocence all were there

but one sad face in the comer sat

half concealed by an old slouch hat

with an ague he shook as the door flew wide
and the brisk conductor came in with a stride
with a pallid face and teeth firm set
the pitiful eye the pitiless met

 tickets   the ticketless man was dumb
laconic his summons were-simply  come 
and the rope was pulled that checked the speed
of the train that thumped gainst the iron
steed

 who is he was asked as they hustled him
    out

 oh  a tramp i suppose-no doubt no doubt
so they pushed him off the platform there

and left him to grope in the cold night air

then the train rushed on with its clinkety-
    clink

and no one missed the sad face i think

for the mirth went on and laughter was loud
and it seemed a happy contented crowd

with the frightful speed the coaches are tossed
for the engineer must gain what hed lost
and the engine quivered as tho in distress
she must be on time-tis the  fast express

and the stars look cold from the wintry skv
on the man who crawled to that station to die
he is  flagging  a train on another line

tis a  through  one they know by his look
    and sign

tis the last we take for the great and
   sublime

it is fleet as the winds and always on time

though a fantom train none need be ap-
   palled

nor tremble if ready when tickets are
   called

j

the engine-driver to his engine

by w j m r

put forth your force my iron horse with
limbs that never tire

the best of oil shall feed your joints
and the best of coal your fire

so off we tear from euston square to beat the
    swift south wind

as we rattle along the north-west rail with
    the special train behind

dash along crash along sixty miles an hour
right through old england flee

for i am bound to see my love

far away in the north countrie

like a train of ghosts the telegraph-posts go
    wildly trooping by

while one by one the milestones run and off
    behind us fly

like foaming wine it fires my blood to sec
   your lightning speed

arabias race neer matched your pace my
   gallant steam-borne steed

wheel along squeal along sixty miles an hour
right through old england flee

for  am bound to see my love

far away in the north countrie

my blessing on george stephenson let his
   fame forever last

for he was the man that found the plan to
   make you run so fast

his arm was strong his head was long he
   knew not guile nor fear

when  think of him it makes me proud that
    i am an engineer

tear along flare along sixty miles an hour
right through old england flee

for i am bound to see my love

far away in the north countrie

now thames and trent are far behind and
   evenings siadcs are come

before my eyes the brown hills rise that guard
    my true loves home

even now she stands my own dear lass be-
   side the cottage door

and she listens for the whistle shrill and the
    blast-pipes rattling roar

roll along bowl along sixty miles an hour
right through old england flee

for i am bound to see my love

at home in the north countrie

  the horizon of vision the circle
which bounds our sight has not
changed

  it is best observed at sea though
the ships of today are larger than the
ships of fifty years ago you cannot
see them until they come up over the
edge of the world fifteen or twenty
miles away

  a generation ago the horizon of
speech was very limited when your
grandfather was a young man his
voice could be heard on a still day for
perhaps a mile even though he used
a speaking trumpet he could not be
heard nearly so far as he could be seen

  today all this has been changed
the telephone has vastly extended
the horizon of speech

  talking two thousand miles is an
everyday occurrence while in order
to see this distance you would need
to mount your telescope on a platform
approximately  miles high

  as a man is followed by his shadow
so is he followed by the horizon of
telephone communication when he
travels across the continent his tele-
phone horizon travels with him and
wherever he may be he is always at
the center of a great circle of telephone
neighbors

  what is true of one man is true of
the whole public in order to provide
a telephone horizon for each member
of the nation the bell system has
been established

your telephone horizon

and associated companies

every bell telephone is the center of the system

the importance of training

        here is a man who was in line for a better job but like the great majority had not been training
    himself tn till the shoes of the man above him lie always thought that if the time ever came he could
    just bluff it through-special training wasnt necessary theres where he made his mistake and theres
    where you will make your mistake if you are not a trained man the boss had only to ask a few questions
    to find that the man did not know anything about the other fellows work that he had been wasting his
    time instead of improving it-that he was just one of the fellows who get into a rut and stick because he
    didnt have sense enough to plan for the future

the time to plan is right now the opportunity will come when you are ready

          dont think  this man did that it is simply ilmattcr of absorbing knowledge and as a matter of course promotion will follow dont
     argue with yourself theres no opportunity here-no incentive to do better work-i have gone as high as  can in this firm- know as much
     as the boss and dont see why i cant get the money

         if the opportunity fur advancement is not right ahead of you with your own firm then it  with another there is always an opportunity
-always a chance for a better job for better pay-yes just the job you have often wished you had-but mere wishing will never get you
anywhere you must get the training

the american school of correspondence wa founded to help just such men
as you it is one of the largest educational institutions in the world if you
