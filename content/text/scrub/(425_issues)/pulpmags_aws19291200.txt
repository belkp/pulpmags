the flying legion by george allan england there are some stories
that for their sheer daring immense scope and convincing style defy adequate
description the flying legion is such a story those lovers of george
allan england will find that it is one of the best stones he has ever written
and those who have not read him before will suddenly realize that they have
missed some of the best in aviation science fiction it is almost futile to try to
define adequately the appeal of this epical story to the lover of aviation to
those who love the strangeness of mysterious places to the lovers of adventure
and to the lovers of great literature the flying legion will come as a peat
experience it is truly a worthy successor to the ark of the covenant

the storm neutralizer by ed earl repp the recent tragic disaster
of the airplane city of sat francisco must have called to the attention of the
entire kicntific world the immediate necessity of finding a means to combat the
ever-present menace of fogs and storms to aviation anyone who finds a means
to overcome or neutralize the effect of a storm will immediately become a great
benefactor to mankind in his present offering mr repp givw us a most
ingenious as well as scientifically plausible means of doing this  with his
fertile mind he has created about a storm neutralizer a story which we can
unhesitatingly call one of the most exciting he has ever written and it will
call to your attention the fact that a benefactor to mankind often has a stormy
path before his value is recognized

adventures in space the deaths head meteor will be very welcome

the airport of the future by h dominik the successful round-
the-world flight of the graf zepptlin has aroused a storm of interest as to the
future of round-the-world schedules in aviation aircraft are no longer limited
to comparatively short hops of a few thousand miles for with the success of
the graf zeppelin and the building of greater airships such as the r- in
great britain the field for long-distance travel by air has been vastly enlarged
but there are many problems to be solved before we can consider that long-
distance travel by airship is definitely here in this article which we have
imported from germany we present some astounding and yet completely prac-

glider flying

by hugo gernsback

ie oldest form of human flying is certainly glider
flying such early experimenters as lilienthal
chanute-as well as wright brothers-all used
gliders without motors

gliders are of several different types the early
gliders having been double- and triple-winged
whereas the modem gliders of to-day are of the monoplane
variety

  at the present time glider flying threatens to become the
sport of the air and is coming rapidly to the forefront in this
country during the period after the war the germans have
done marvelous work in glider flying and recently a young
german stayed aloft over eighteen hours in one of these gliders
relying simply upon the updrafts of the air to keep him aloft

  this may sound incredible but it is an accomplished fact
and shows us what may become possible in the future

  roughly speaking the modern glider takes advantage of the
upward currents of air particularly as they occur around hilly
country this is considered true glider flying but there is still
another method whereby a glider can be towed by means of
cither a motorboat an automobile or a regular motored airplane

  the automobile towing and motorboat pulling methods are
however not considered good form by glider experts who
prefer to soar like birds free of all entanglements

  of course our work in glider flying is as yet a crude begin-
ning and no one knows its possibilities sooner or later it may
develop into a commercial means of transport in a manner
that we do not even suspect to-day

  for instance the germans have recently made a number of
experiments which were highly successful two gliders were
towed by means of long ropes by one engine-propelled airplane
thus they have made a real train similar to our locomotive-and-
car combination they argue that with little additional energy
it is possible to lift up three airplanes two of which are engine-
less and transport either passengers or freight through the air
at an exceedingly low cost this seems plausible because the
greatest part of the weight of an airplane is the engine and

this is absent in a towed glider the extra weight usually
taken up by the engine can be used in the glider for freight
or passengers when the towed glider nears its destination the
pilot of the glider cuts loose from the tow line and glides down
to earth this landing the germans point out is very much
easier to accomplish in a glider than in a motored plane
because the angle of glide is much less on a glider-it can cover
a greater horizontal distance while descending

  all sorts of possibilities aside from the sporting clement
open to us in the field of gliders we may be sure for instance
that the future air liners will carry lifeboats in the form of
gliders other possibilities are gliders with a sort of auxiliary
engine without propellers but using rocket propulsion through
compressed air or some other means the auxiliary power
system would be used only to maintain altitude for instance
a glider if it were released from an altitude of one or two
miles could glide down in a flat angle thereby covering a dis-
tance of thirty or forty miles in such a glide no power of
any kind would be needed except to lift the glider up to the
required height it may be even possible to go back to the old
hot-air-balloon system to raise the glider to the necessary
height ordinary straw or woqd burned underneath the balloon-
like contrivance would furnish all the buoyancy for a temporary
paper or silk balloon to lift up the glider

  on the other hand there is a tremendous possibility in every
country for gliders purely as for sport while no such spec-
tacular flights have been made in this country as in germany
the time is rapidly nearing when america will be on a par with
germany in glider construction and operation

  and let  one think that it is an expensive sport good
gliders that can carry one man can be built anywhere from
 up and they can be flown practically anywhere where
there are hills or where there arc prevalent winds with a
velocity of fifteen to twenty miles an hour nor is the new
sport dangerous for the planes are very light even a crash
is of little consequence and there seems to be no record of
anyone having been killed flying a modern glider

  glider flying is certainly one of the greatest and most
exhilarating sports as yet devised


and now the remaining planes unmindful of the awful power flashing from their adversary
charged straight at him but before they were fairly under way one of them began to wobble
then it dropped in a tail spin to the sea


the blue demon
by the author of the air terror

y	plane was a complete success having won
for our nation a sweeping victor- and thus
caused its adoption by the united states
government as our chief type of aircraft
 was intensely gratified jealously guard-
ing the salient features of its construction and swear-
ing every air official and pilot to secrecy the govern-
ment sought to maintain its monopoly of the invention
although i wast still horribly crippled in body by
my fall in the hour of victory i could endure the
hardships of my new life in the knowledge that i had
helped save my country only one
cloud shadowed my happiness and
that was the disappearance of my
old friend lon grand the man who
had made my success possible

  our late enemies had resumed dip-
lomatic intercourse with us and the
whole world was again at peace and
then with the stunning suddenness
of a thunderclap from a blue sky
came new rumblings of disturbance
to our security

  my good friend colonel brandon
who had been promoted to the com-
mand of the first corps of our air
squadrons was lost at sea with every
ship of his fleet which comprised
three hundred of the largest and
swiftest aircraft in the service

  the first tidings of the disaster
came by radio to the air depart-
ment at washington it came with shocking brevity

  we are attacked-half the fleet is down was the
brief and startling message which came at once from
a score of ships on this beautiful summer day then
there was only silence-profound and mysterious in
vain the radio operators throughout the country tried
to pick up further details every ship on the sea and
in the air within a radius of five hundred miles was
besieged by frantic appeals for definite news of the
tragedy but none had seen the air fleet colonel
brandon had reported his position but two hours be-
fore being then twenty miles due east of minot ledge
light and going into for-
mation for the monthly
coast-defence maneuvers

  then came the sudden
message and silence

but for the fact that
colonel brandons com-
mand failed to answer
even their code signals
the air department
would have been inclined
to treat the matter as a
huge hoax or the miscar-
riage of air messages

  swift scouting planes
were dispatched from
boston and the sea for
hundreds of leagues
around the first air
corps last known posi-
tion was searched in vain

not a clue not even a
scrap of the great air fleet

could be found it had completely disappeared yet
since all were seaplanes it seemed incredible that all
could be forced down and leave no trace upon the sea

   one by one the scout planes returned to their home
base messages came from all over sea and land that
the fleet had not been sighted after that last report to
the air department the mystery deepened many
theories were advanced only to be rejected as unten-
able hojv could a great air fleet in the broad glare
of day in perfect flying weather and during times of
peace and security suddenly disappear and leave not
a trace yet that seeming impossi-
bility had happened besides the
frenzied message to the air depart-
ment tliere remained not the slight-
est token to denote that a major
calamity had occurred

   all through the night the search
went on and the perplexity and curi-
osity of the nation grew apace
everybody knew that it was clearly
impossible for a large air fleet over
either land or sea to be obliterated
within the space of a few minutes
the thing was unprecedented and be-
yond the pale of reason so great
was the excitement of the people that
countless thousands remained awake
and by every known means of com-
munication importuned the authori-
ties for news of the fleet yet there
was no news to give

a strange tale

then early the next morning a privately-owned
seaplane crept disabled into the harbor at boston
its owner a well-known business man and his wife
told a weird and unbelievable story it seems that they
had been cruising at a high altitude at noon the pre-
vious day their position was a hundred miles east-
north-east of strawberry point and through their
glasses they saw colonel brandons ships circle out over
the sea and begin their maneuvers although the air
cruisers were several miles distant the air was clear

and the movements could
be seen plainly sud-
denly the watchers saw
a score or more of the
planes scattered here and
there among the fleet
break from the lines
gyrate strangely then
bank and dive into the
sea at once the forma-
tion was broken many
planes now began to dart
about in confusion and
they saw others falling
out of control for an
instant the flagship
seemingly attempted to
rally them and restore
the line it was in vain
rapidly the planes were
falling but there was no
battle-no foe of any de-
scription was in sight

lowell howard morrow

  at doubt you have enjoyed the air
   l v terror if you did then this pres-
   ent effort by the same author will prove an
   enjoyable continuation of mr morrows ideas
   this author has a way to keep you guessing
   and to keep your excitement at a high pitch at

	air wonder stories

the two spectators gazed in awe and wonder as they
realized that some strange and terrible force was work-
ing havoc with the fleet they swept both sea and
air with their glasses there were no boats in sight
and the air above the fleet was free from planes only
a few low-hanging clouds were visible and above them
the sky was blue and unflecked by a single object but
while they continued to gaze in amazement plane after
plane pitched about rolled over then dived down to
its doom

  nearly all were down and had been swallowed by
the sea when the watchers own plane developed motor
trouble and they had to glide down being without
a radio transmitter they were unable to report at once
the mysterious catastrophe and only after many hours
work on the motor were they enabled to limp into
boston

  the whole nation was stunned out of a peaceful
sky had come sudden death to more than two thousand
men and destruction to the stanchest air fleet in the
world every ship was constructed throughout of
metal and was supposedly capable of keeping afloat
in a rough sea for hours yet all had been destroyed
in a few minutes and not even a scrap of wreckage
had been left to tell the tale uncle sams newest and
best-equipped air squadron which our military experts
had declared invincible had been annihilated within an
hour of our coast

  but it seemed that nothing could be done about it
no aircraft had been seen above or below the fleet
before its destruction began neither had there been
visible a warship or a submarine near to husband other
planes and even though there had been such an agency
bent on the destruction of our planes how could it have
accomplished its purpose so swiftly and completely
nor could the government through all its diplomats
and agents located in every capitol on earth obtain
any inkling as to the cause of the disaster other gov-
ernments and the foreign press were very sympathetic
and courteous but all other nations were as much in
the dark as and mystified as we it was as though an
avenging angel from on high had suddenly appeared
and smitten the planes soundings were made at the
point where the fleet was reported to have gone down
but the depth was too great for the work of divers so
nothing was salvaged to aid in the solution of the
mystery

  after a few weeks the wrath and the excitement of
our nation began to cool and as the weeks merged
into months the prominence of the affair faded as life
resumed its normal course the tragic loss of the air
squadrons was recorded among the archives of the
worlds unsolved riddles folks now began to doubt
the story of the boston aviators meanwhile the gov-
ernment was still secretly probing the mystery while it
set diligently to work to repair the loss

  it was then that the whole country was shocked by
a sudden repetition of the dire tragedy-but this time
over the land

  it was late in the afternoon in mid-november the
sky was overcast and the earth below was drenched by
fog banks swept along by a cold raw wind the sixth
air squadron comprising more than one hundred fight-
ing planes while returning to the home port at annapo-
lis from maneuvers in the west was feeling its way
through the fog above the blue ridge mountains sud-
denly radio messages leaped out of the air with the
direful intelligence that it had been attacked without
warning by an unseen foe that the planes suddenly
thrown out of control were pitching about wildly and

crashing into the hills and then as in the case of
colonel brandons ill-fated command communication
with the fleet abruptly ceased

  the air department at oncc ordered all available
planes to the rescue since i happened to be in an-
napolis on a motor trip i swung out of the automobile
on my crutches on which i was now able to move a
short distance and made my way over to the flagship
of the fleet

  want to come with us mr clare inquired com-
mander benson genially

  i nodded and he helped me into the cabin

  we were all too much excited to talk as we shot up
through the banks of fog and then darted westward
toward the blue ridge

  although our speed was great darkness had fallen
by the time we reached the vicinity of the disaster
the dreary blackness of the night was intensified by a
cold rain that swept down from the north beside
the moan of the storm the slither of the rain across
the wings and the subdued murmur of the motors there
was no other sound but the fog had lifted and we
shot our searchlights into the gloom in search of the
foe nothing but the flare-illumined hills was visible
then fearfully we set the beams of our lights earth-
ward hoping against hope and dreading the revelations
we knew were in store for us

  soon we located the crumpled wreckage of the squad-
ron strewn over the rocks and scattered about over the
bushes and among the trees of the forest some planes
were impaled on tree-tops some had crashed against
hillsides and others lay deep and almost concealed at
the bottom of wooded gulleys

chapter ii
what the planes revealed

as we dropped down seeking a spot on which to
land it was apparent that every plane had been
destroyed as before the work of the unseen
fiends had been thorough but here at least they had
left a clue here no sea had destroyed the evidence
here we had something tangible to work upon

  we finally landed on a flat space near one of the
crushed planes the officers with commander benson
in the lead sprang from the cabin and rushed to the
wreck on my crutches i hobbled after them as fast
as i could with the assistance of two of the crew and
then standing there huddled together in the rain we
stared dumbfounded and speechless at the ghastly sight
our flashlights revealed with one glance we saw that
all the bodies of the planes crew were in the cabin
none had had a chance to jump two of the pilots
still sat in their seats their stiffened hands gripping the
controls their staring eyes wide and terrified as though
death had come unexpectedly the remainder of the
crew sat in their places or sprawled on the floor but
the most appalling thing about them was their color
the skin of each was a pale yellowish blue we pulled
up the sleeves of one and opened his shirt front his
whole body was blue but we could find no wounds
abrasions or burns of any kind

  we saw that all had been killed instantly by some
subtle and powerful force nor did the planes them-
selves show any marks of battle what damage they had
received came as a result of the crash

  commander benson sighed and looked around with
a bewildered stare i saw that he like the rest of us
was completely mystified

  god he breathed at last this is awful and
the blue demon	

the color of the corpses i never saw anything so hor-
rible to think that the boys had no chance-never
a chance

  upon the mountain slopes and through the valleys
we could now see the bobbing lights of other searching
parties some were near us and hoarsely called out
their reports and discoveries all coincided with our
own

  i almost believe that we are dealing with the devil
himself said commander benson grimly these
men have been killed by some electromagnetic agency
i am sure yet we find no burns or marks upon their
bodies nor do we find signs of fire upon the planes
but the eyewitnesses of colonel brandons destruction
affirm that they distinctly saw fire enveloping at least
one of the planes as it plunged to the sea however
what they saw might have been the flashes of sunlight
on the metal parts

  despite that fact we may have here a different
method of destruction i suggested

  that is possible agreed captain collins here
as in the case of the brandon tragedy our known facts
are meager we are at peace with the whole world
for months there has been not even a diplomatic quar-
rel and here we can find no trace of an enemy
where then can we look for a solution to this dark
mystery the captain paused and looked at us with
a startled air

  commander benson stared and scratched his head
thoughtfully

  we have one thing to work on commander i said
you will recall that only military planes have been
attacked and it is only our planes that were de-
stroyed  and it is a significant fact that they were the
most powerful in the world so far as we know

  by george i believe you jre right clare said
commander benson  our enemy whoever he is and
however he accomplishes his dastardly work has a mili-
tary reason for it

  and it strikes me that he has covered his tracks
well said captain collins dryly

  nof by a damned sight snapped commander ben-
son glaring about him savagely well get this blue
demon of the skies or sell our lives in the attempt

  amen we all agreed solemnly

the dearth of clues

unfortunately there was nothing we could
do that night to salvage the planes or to succor
their unfortunate crews for all were dead all tinted
by that horrible blue color all with that expression of
surprise and wonder on their faces

  we sought shelter from the storm in an airport
across the mountains and sleepiessly awaited the com-
ing of the dawn

  the day broke bright and clear and after a hasty
breakfast we returned to our sad task the bodies of
the brave airmen who had sacrificed their lives to an
unknown foe without opportunity to strike a blow in
their defence were gathered together reverently and
conveyed to washington during all this work we
made but one more important discovery-nearly every
plane had been smashed beyond repair

  diligent inquiry among the residents of the sparsely-
settled region failed to bring us any clues no one
had either heard or seen any strange planes in that
vicinity-only the regular mail planes had passed no
one had heard any sounds of battle or commotion in
the skies nor had any strangers been seen upon the
roads for many weeks those abroad on the roads in

the vicinity of the tragedy on the night of the storm
had seen or heard nothing unusual

  we kept up our inquiries for days and patrolled the
air for miles around but without result and finally
we were forced to go home sadder but no wiser

  the national wonder and excitement following this
tragedy was even greater than the aftermath of colonel
brandons end as usual in such cases the public
blamed the government for not discovering and pun-
ishing the miscreants mass meetings were held in
every important city and red-faced orators called loudly
for action against the weaklings in our administration
resolutions condemning everything and everybody in
general were offered and adopted by the score action
action was the cry the censure of the air depart-
ment was unreasonable in the extreme the public
wildly demanded an investigation and the removal and
punishment of certain high officials whether guilty or
innocent with the blood scent in their nostrils they
were looking for some prey it was pertinently asserted
that probably the secrets covering our military planes
had been betrayed to a foreign power and that men
high in the councils of state in collusion with said
government had entered into a conspiracy to destroy
our chief arm of defence incredible and preposterous
though as this accusation was it found thousands of
adherents among the thoughtless thus embarrassing
the administration and hindering any sane solution of
the problem

  while public opinion was still at white heat and
official washington seemed on the verge of collapse
the nation was terrified by the news that our unseen and
unknown enemy had again struck this time the vic-
tims were small groups of planes and single units far
removed from help but the results were the same
our men had been sent to their death without warning
or a chance to defend themselves in no instance did
these planes have an opportunity to use their radio
the same sickly blue tint was found on the victims
skins although in a few instances the planes had
been seen to go into a spin and fall no one had seen
what struck them down all declared that this awful
power whatever it was was invisible and the most
deadly thing the world had ever known there was
no clue no explanation no chance to apprehend the
terrible destroyer we were further astounded by the
news that the agents of this monster had struck in a
score of places within the short space of an hour and
always the victim had been a military plane

  the nation all but went mad for days both business
and industry were virtually suspended men and women
throughout the country stood about in groups discuss-
ing in accents of awe and terror the visitations of this
power it was apparent to the most obtuse that unless
this damnable thing were speedily curbed and rendered
harmless our country would soon lie prone and help-
less under the heel of a conqueror yet what was to
be done how were we to grapple with a foe that
could not be heard or seen the only evidences of whose
existence were the grisly reminders of its visits but
we were somewhat comforted by the fact that the whole
civilized world sympathized with us every power
large and small sent condolences and lavish offers of
aid but these gracious sentiments reassuring as they
were did not help us to solve the mystery the situ-
ation was acute-the future pregnant with horror and
disaster

  in sheer desperation the air department finally sent
for me why it did so god only knows for i was
plunged as deeply in the morass of fear and uncer-
	air wonder stories

tainty as any nephew of uncle sam however i went
gladly though i was somewhat ill at ease as i entered
the council room and gazed upon the grim gray faces
of the nations leaders grouped about the long table

  i have known commander benson for years and i
want to state now here that no braver man ever sat at
the controls of a plane but when he came forward to
meet me and took my hand there were tears in his
honest blue eyes and for a moment he could not speak

  clare for gods sake help us he finally said
hoarsely we are at the end of our rope and unless
something is done mighty quick our country will be
on the rocks

  how can i help i asked humbly

  i hardly know he replied with a gesture of de-
spair but we have hoped that as the inventor of the
plane you might be able to suggest something

  one of the inventors i corrected sharply you
forget that there was another associated with me

  we then went over to the table where commander
benson introduced me-really a superfluous proceed-
ing as i was known to nearly every man there

  we earnestly desire your opinion mr clare said
the air secretary with regard to this nameless scourge
that has swooped down upon us we think that you
perhaps may be able to show us a way out please
speak frankly

my plan

i gazed about the room the heavy shades on the
windows were down and the doors were closed
have no fear said the secretary divining my
thoughts we speak behind closed doors and the
entire building is under guard

  gentlemen i deeply appreciate this confidence i
said though i fear that there is little i can do to un-
ravel the net of perplexing circumstances that sur-
rounds us however i have arrived at certain con-
clusions which i have hitherto thought best to keep
to myself but which i now frankly make known for
what they may be worth allow me to say then that
it seems to me that we are still psychologically at war
with those powers with whom we made a formal peace
several years ago our victory over them as you know
was due to the superiority of our planes this bitter
fact still rankles in the hearts of our erstwhile foes
ostensibly at peace with us i believe they have secretly
invented some devilish engine of destruction and en-
gaged in this underhanded campaign to destroy our
chief arm of defence when this is accomplished they
will come out into the open declare war and have us
at their mercy it is clear to me that they must have
a base somewhere in the old world also one here in
america i would advise that a close watch be kept
on all the capitals in the east

  our secret service men have been working in those
countries since the loss of colonel brandons fleet
said the secretary but they have found nothing
as the attacks have all been made on our military
planes i resumed i think it would le wise to remove
all such planes from active service so far as possible
and confine them within their hangars and home fields
until we can locate and grapple with this menace which
commander benson has aptly named the blue demon
and since this destroyer whatever it is comes out of
the skies we must look for it there we must battle and
overcome it there

  i am convinced that this unknown enemy of ours
is using an electromagnetic force i went on it may
come from a great distance or it may be directed at

comparatively close range but it lias occurred to me
that we might insulate against it of course we do
not understand the nature of this ray-if ray it is-
for although invisible it leaves a blue stain which
would indicate that some sort of chemical action forms
one of its characteristics yet i believe that we can
insulate against it our secret air patrol should be
greatly augmented but i would suggest that all planes
be sent into the air in single units widely scattered

  clare i think your idea of insulating the planes a
mighty good one spoke up commander benson
somewhere in the air this deadly thing lurks but
what in gods name are we to look for no one has
reported any suspicious-looking aircraft loitering about
and who among us is astute enough to recognize this
blue monster should we meet him

  of course no one had an answer to these perplexing
questions indeed it seemed an absurd and impossible
task to hunt for and fight an invisible foe that we
had to thank an old enemy for these hellish crimes
there could be no doubt but what enemy we could
not charge any nation with such dastardly conduct in
times of peace such an accusation would be equivalent
to a declaration of war yet all realized that some-
thing must be done and that soon the temper of the
people demanded drastic action of some sort war
with all its carnage and heartache was preferable to
this supine submission to the frightful attacks of an
unknown foe

  for several minutes a poignant silence hung over the
room the very atmosphere of the place was eloquent
of the uncertainty we felt all realized that the life
of a mighty nation was at stake and the thought came
to me that here among those grim and silent men about
that table must be found a savior

  at last general marshall rose in his place his face
was pale and seamed his lips set but his eyes deny-
ing the years of his snow-white hair blazed with the
ardor of youth general marshall had been a pioneer
in the early days of the air defence he had sounded the
tocsin of warning and the call for an adequate air
fleet until he had won his point against immense odds
now his advice was eagerly sought and followed even
by those who once had been his bitterest opponents

  mr secretary he egan in clear firm tones i
recommend that mr clares-

  he paused abruptly and stood staring wide-eyed at
the loud speaker in the center of the table as the air
departments code signal rasped out on the air

  mr secretary came the announcers hoarse voice
from the government airdrome at annapolis i have
the duty to report that three more battle planes have
just crashed on this field and our hangars are in
flames 

  we stared at one another in helpless dismay slowly
as in a daze every man got to his feet and waited
breathlessly for the next words this was the most
stunning blow that had yet been struck they were
boldly attacking our planes in their home ports they
were burning our hangars before our very eyes and
it seemed that we were helpless to do anything to thwart
them we gazed in awe at the loud speaker but no
further words came in some manner the announcer
had been cut off

  i recommend that mr clares proposal be adooted
continued general marshall at last his cool collected
voice tending to relieve the tension i further recom-
mend that he be placed in charge of our air scouts and
empowered to act at his own discretion and in his own
way that all red tape pertaining to his duties be slashed
the blue demon

at once and that he be given every possible aid in the
execution of his plans

chapter iii
after the demon

at once a loud clamor arose the enemy was at
our doors again we must get a fleet under way
 immediately and hunt down this destroyer there
was no time to lose in experiments-and so on but
in the midst of this hue and cry general marshall held
up his hand for silence at last in deference to his
years and experience the commotion ceased

  gentlemen resumed the general i beg you to
curb your impatience to assemble and send out an-
other fleet against this masked invader would be sheer
madness our inability to cope with him openly has
been demonstrated to our sorrow we are dealing with
a new form of enemy unseen deadly and without
mercy as mr clare has suggested our best hope is
to render our planes immune to his thrusts-if we can
do so-for only in this way may we learn the secret
of his power and destroy it

  mr clare how long do you think it would take to
insulate a fleet of-say-a dozen scouting planes
asked the secretary

  perhaps two weeks i replied but i take pleas-
ure in informing you that already i have one plane in
readiness they all turned in their chairs to stare at
me incredulously i have anticipated the need of
such a plane i went on

  and you are ready to take the air in it gasped
the secretary

  i am with your permission

good  exclaimed the secretary his face brighten-
ing how do you propose to work he added quietly

  i hardly know i confessed our task is un-
precedented and we fight blindly circumstances must
largely guide our action we know not where to look
for this monster but i propose to go into the air
after it to stay in the air refueling from supply planes
until i either run down and destroy this infernal power
or am destroyed by it

  a murmur of applause followed but i was far from
feeling as brave as my words this indefinable un-
seen terror had worked on my nerves too and i was
in very truth fearful of the ultimate outcome to lose
our envied position as leader of the worlds air powers
was humiliating enough but to have these children of
my brain destroyed without being able to strike a single
blow in their defence was maddening

  commander benson sprang to his feet

  i urge that mr clares services be accepted at
once he said crisnly and that he be dispatched on
his errand without delay

  you shall have a free hand said the secretary
shaking my hand pray take your insulated plane
and go at once and may god speed you what pilots
do you wish to accompany you he added quickly
as we passed into the crowded anteroom

  my eyes swept the faces of the airmen present
there were many aces there all time-tried and true
the available supply was great but when i saw cap-
tain price colonel brandons son-in-law and captain
collins looking at me longingly my choice was made

  i will take captain price and captain collins with
me mr secretary if you please i said 

  they came forward to thank me for the compliment
but i waved them back with a smile

  come lets go i said swinging toward the door



on my crutches with our hangars burning and our
whole air fleet menaced with destruction i knew there
was no time to lose

  we took to the air that very night and began an
aimless ramble through the skies i say aimless and
such it was so far as destination and a campaign of
action were concerned we realized that one lone plane
against an invisible antagonist of whose size power
and location we had but vague conceptions stood but
a meager chance of success

  the weather was cold but beautiful not a cloud
drifted across the star-studded sky there was scarcely
any breeze and the air was clear

  to our surprise the weather continued fair for the
next three weeks and we enjoyed it to the best of our
ability considering the constant strain we were under
it was one of those calm clear decembers we some-
times have along the atlantic coast day and night we
sailed the sky sometimes far inland at others far at
sea changing our course and altitude frequently but
nothing occurred to stir our blood or mar our voyage
all was as serene and peaceful as a country church-
yard the demon had not been heard from again the
people began to lose their fear and we to feel like fools
on a wild-goose chase but the government did not
relax its vigilance by this time more than a score of
the new insulated planes were on scouting duty

  then one day as we flew high over the ocean the
weather suddenly changed clouds began to gather
and roll up from the east the wind freshened and
brought with it a chill in less than an hour we were
among the clouds and so we dropped to a warmer
stratum of air the cloud banks mounted rapidly and
we thought that the whole heavens would soon be
blanketed though the sky to the west was still clear
and blue

  we turned landward not wishing to be caught in
a storm but as we sped on i looked back at the roll-
ing clouds and studied them idly then my attention
was suddenly attracted to four curiously-formed clouds
detached from the main mass and drifting slowly north-
ward these cloud formations perhaps a hundred
yards in circumference were white and irregular in
shape with long feathery streamers and columns pro-
truding and floating from the edges and curling about
the main body and as i looked i fancied that there
were spots on the surface that billowed rose and fell
puffed up and subsided like the slow exhaust from a
steam pipe and in the center of each cloud was a
mass of snow-white vapor such as one often sees scurry-
ing over the water in the lap of a gale through the
binoculars the clouds seemed to be composed of fog
particles rather than rain-laden vapor

  funny-looking clouds remarked captain price
observing my intense interest i handed the glasses to
him

  damn curious he said calling captain collins
attention the barometer remains stationary and i
can see no cause for this peculiar condensation

  their motion is contrary to the drift of the lower
clouds remarked collins it is strange that although
we are getting the wind from due east that those clouds
so near us and at the same altitude are moving north

  so saying he turned the plane about without ques-
tioning his motive we continued to stare as we flew
back to within a quarter of a mile of the clouds then
paused in a hover to watch their motions to our sur-
prise we saw that they were no longer drifting the
erratic air current had released them and they were
now motionless their surface no longer heaved and
	air wonder stories

pulsated as though with life only the long ribbons
of exquisite cloud tracery as delicately fashioned as
the most intricate lace still swayed and waved around
the edges as though blown about by the wind

  they are just ordinary clouds after all said cap-
tain price in disgust i thought we were about to dis-
cover some new meteorological marvel

what came from the clouds

i dont know what made me gaze up into the blue
just at that time-so remarkable are the coincidences
of life-but i saw a dark object descending swiftly
from thousands of feet above us down it came with
incredible speed and then to my surprise i saw that
it was a large plane similar to our own

  one of our boys has spotted us i said calling my
companions attention to the plane but to our amaze-
ment this new arrival seemed not to have seen us or
he did not wish to make our acquaintance for he
came on down straight as a stone at last he came
to a hovering rest about two hundred yards from the
strange-appearing clouds which now seemed to turn
back and merge with the dark background of vapor

  suddenly something blinding flashed above the new-
comers plane scintillated and flamed out like a large
mirror in the sunlight while spirals of blue fire ran
along his wings and seemed to leap from them we
stared in wonder

  look look cried price

  following his startled gaze we saw a large white
plane below the edge of the clouds go hurtling down
to the sea

  he dropped out of that cloud said collins in a
low voice of awe and wheres the cloud  he added
in bewilderment ill swear it was there but a moment
ago

  he was right there were but three of the white
clouds left and they seemed about to be absorbed by
the dark masses behind them

  they have drifted into the other clouds i ex-
plained

  the lieutenant shook his head

  there goes another i cried captain price grabbing
my arm in his excitement just as i again saw that
appalling flash of fire on the strangers plane but
even before the stricken plane struck the waves i ob-
served that another white cloud had completely dis-
appeared before we had a chance to recover from
our amazement or to discuss the startling occurrence
we saw a third plane dart from the cloud bank out of
control

  at him i shouted wildly it is the blue demon
and he is killing our friends we will be next

  before the words were out of my mouth my pilots
were driving the plane forward at terrific speed at
last we were to come to grips with the ruthless beast
of the air that had eluded us so long the remainder
of our air forces would be saved and the darkest mys-
tery that had ever stained our military record would
be solved but as we rushed on we were greatly
alarmed and puzzled by the tactics of our strange enemy
for several moments he retreated then paused as if
in doubt while his plane was bathed in a dazzling
sheen of fire then as we stared agape he shot away
with bewildering swiftness and melted into the clouds

  he has beaten us gasped captain price damn
him 

  chagrined and humiliated we stopped in the edge
of the clouds we could not see ten yards into that
black rolling mass ave hesitated to penetrate its folds

however we were given scant time to consider our
problem a cry of alarm from lieutenant collins drew
my attention several hundred feet above us and to
the right about a hundred yards away we saw another
large white plane like the ones already sent down
emerge from the clouds and dart toward us like a shot
we gazed apprehensively-probably the same thought
was in the mind of each-was this newcomer friend
or foe and then i saw that the fourth white cloud
had disappeared

  because of the sudden chill in the air we had closed
the cabin every window door and port was shut
but we watched the oncoming plane through the heavy
plate glass windows wondering whether to meet it in
a spirit of friendship to retreat or to give battle it
was a biplane but of a pattern radically different from
any we had ever seen its fuselage was extra large and
swung low and it carried two motors

  good lord suddenly exclaimed collins look
everything is turning blue

  we stared aghast the air outside was swiftly as-
suming that deathly terrifying hue that was associated
with the blue demon

  keep the cabin closed i cried if that blue stuff
gets in we are doomed and-and-boys the insula-
tion works i added triumphantly lets ram him

  so we turned and darted toward the plane that by
this time had reached our own level i say darted
which should be the right word for our motors and
other machinery were functioning splendidly but to
our amazement and consternation we were barely mov-
ing some great repellent force like the blast of a
gale was holding us in check in vain we tried to in-
crease our speed knowing that without it our foe held
the advantage yet he was not firing at us we saw
no sign of life about the plane the weapon he was
using against us was the swift and silent one of elec-
tricity but there was no flash or fire about the great
white bird to indicate it-it was apparent only by that
indistinct blue haze and the powerful agent that was
retarding our flight there seemed to be nothing to
do but to turn back and retreat yet i knew by the
stem grim faces of my pilots that such a thing had
not entered their minds

  they motioned me to the controls and aimed the for-
ward machine-gun as we slowly forged ahead at first
our shots made no impression neither did the foe re-
treat but at last in the midst of the fierce rattle of
the shots we saw the white plane quiver bank suddenly
and then go into a nose dive we had scored a hit
but after a drop of several hundred feet she flattened
out and darted south like a bullet

  after him shouted price

  and then we bent every energy to the chase we
were gratified that the force that had checked us had
been removed and that although the blue haze still sur-
rounded our plane we had recovered ourmormal speed
and our foe was mortal-we had wounded him-we
had repelled his terrible ray and he was running from
us however it took us but a few minutes to discover
that we had an adversary worthy of our steel so far as
speed was concerned save in our own planes i had
never witnessed such rapid flight mile after mile the
white plane held her own despite our most strenuous
efforts she flew due south maintaining one level
and not deviating a hairs breadth from her course

  ill bet they are making for south america said
price i have seen many places along the orinoco
where an airplane base might be safely hidden but
wherever she leads we will follow he added savagely
the blue demon	

  amen said collins we will follow him and
beat him to a frazzle because our insulation renders
us immune to his devilish ray

the men of the east

but our ambition to discover and destroy his base
was doomed to disappointment before two hours
had passed the wind suddenly increased assumed the
proportions of a gale shrieked about our ship buffeting
it and straining it in every fiber soon the whole heav-
ens were black with storm-tossed clouds across which
the lightning ran in vivid tongues of fire the rain
fell in torrents and as a deep twilight settled about us
the sea was blotted out in the mist and ahead we could
see nothing but a gray wall of swirling rain

loudly cursing the weather price looked at me

  i think we had better land i said in answer to the
question in his eyes weve lost track of the plane
anyhow and it is not likely that we can pick it up again
in this storm

  perhaps the scoundrels will go above it suggested
lieutenant collins

  if they were not damaged they might i said
but now that we are off their trail i think they will
take the opportunity to land on some desolate spot to
make temporary repairs we have made a good start
today-we have met the blue demon in actual combat
and all but beaten him let us console ourselves with
these facts we will go toward shore lay up for the
night and perhaps to-morrow we may have better luck

  accordingly we turned west and in a half hour fly-
ing low we saw a flat sandy island beneath us on
this we landed and made things snug for the night

  the storm continued for several hours but the
dawn broke clear the wind had veered to the south
and now dying away was breaking up the clouds above
a tossing sea patches of blue sky showed at inter-
vals and through a rift in the clouds we sailed up into
the sunshine

  shall we go back home or continue south for a
spell in the hope that we may sight our quarry i
asked

  lets keep on for another day at least replied
price

  i agree to that said collins

  as that was my notion also we accordingly set our
course south

  the clouds were breaking up rapidly we sailed
high above them flying leisurely and keeping a sharp
lookout for the white plane suddenly through a
break in the vapor we saw it just above the sea its
speed was much more leisurely than that of the day
before

  we will drop down and rip him open said price
joyously weve got him this time

  remembering the deadly blue ray we closed every
opening of the cabin as we began our dive but we
were not to have an easy victory hardly had we left
the shelter of the clouds when he saw us and made
for the island we had just left once more that thin
blue liaze surrounded us

  keep your damned rays to yourself sneered col-
lins they dont bother us any

  it was true-we felt no discomfort-and this time
the ray or whatever it was seemed to have lost its
potency it had not the power to seriously check our
flight

  something mighty serious has happened to those
birds said collins gleefully theyve lost their pep
and are sure our meat

  but the great white plane put on a sudden burst of
speed and at the same time our engine began to miss
we lost speed and the planes nose dropped we came
up quickly however and once more got above our
adversary and sprayed him with bullets from our ma-
chine guns again he out-maneuvered us and we
missed captain price cursed roundly as the beautiful
white creature zoomed up out of reach we saw their
game-they would get above us and once more elude
us among the clouds but tfiey were too slow with
all the tremendous force at our command we came up
under them tore into their fuselage and broke a wing
then as we drew swiftly back the white plane like a
crippled bird lurched drunkenly then plunged a whirl-
ing streak of white to the ground it landed in a
clump of palmettos and burst into flame

  in a fever of haste and anxiety we landed near and
hurried toward the burning plane fearing that the fire
would rob us of the fruits of our victory i reached
the plane by extraordinary effort just behind my pilots
the fire was roaring around the motors evidently some
of the gas pipes had burst in the crash the cabin
was badly shattered and protruding half way through
a broken window hung the body of a dark-skinned
man my companions pulled him from the wreckage
carried him aside and laid him under a palmetto he
was a handsome man with raven-black hair and jet
black eyes his features were finely molded and regu-
lar his hands small but muscular with tapering fingers
his build athletic a purple turban its scarf awry was
on his head

  some high-caste oriental or im a goat exclaimed
price

  we stared at one another who could be our myster-
ious opponents 

  in the cabin of the wreck we found the body of an-
other oriental garbed like his comrade but of shorter
stature a careful search revealed no sign of any other
being about the craft

  all efforts to extinguish the fire with sand were
useless we could only stand back and watch it bum
itself out which it did when the petrol tanks were
empty

  when at last the metal parts had cooled sufficiently
to be handled we went about among them and exam- 
ined them with care and awe despite the fact that
the motors and the other machinery were blackened
and warped their rods valves and dials broken and
twisted by the intense heat they presented an intricate
maze of delicate and wonderful mechanical construc-
tion we poked about among the mass but the fire
had destroyed the great secrets which we sought we
could not explain the functions of the ruined batteries
and tanks those queer-looking motors and pumps we
could not rearrange the severed wires we could not
reconstruct the melted mirrors- reflectors and trans-
formers nor did a diligent search of the unburned
portion of the plane reward us with a single document
to help us in our problem in fact there were no papers
of any kind no records or plans who were these men
of the east  and by whom were they sent  only a
scant wardrobe and a little bedding were all that we
found in the cabin

  the damned assassins have covered their tracks
well snapped price disgustedly our victory is
barren

  in a degree that is true i acknowledged ruefully
for this plane as we witnessed in the skirmish yes-
terday is but one of many-maybe thousands-hiding
away somewhere awaiting a favorable time to strike
	air wonder stories

us but of course we have made a little progress against
the enemy and we have uncovered two rays of hope
our planes are more than a match for them in battle
and it is evident that they are fighting among them-
selves

  my companions stared

  the fight we saw yesterday seems to prove that
i went on the plane that got away from us in the
clouds is a distorted copy of our own

  that is so agreed price evidently the two fac-
tions arc jealous of each other but added to our
other problems we have discovered another-compli-
cations with some foreign power

  that will work itself out in time i believe but
now we must set out for home

chapter iv
the foe invades washington

we got home without further adventures our
report to the air department was held secret
not a word leaking out to the public

  for several days all was quiet the weather was
fair business was good and once more the people be-
lieved that the worst was over then one day in the
midst of a storm the enemy again struck it happened
over washington above the capitol itself six mili-
tary planes which had not yet been insulated winging
their way home to fort myer were suddenly attacked
and destroyed their wrecks were strung along in a
zigzag line extending from the washington monument
beyond the lincoln memorial every man aboard them
was killed and every body tore that grisly blue mark
of the mysterious slayer

  the national defence council assailed on all sides
by a righteously indigant and suspicious public and
smarting under another bitter reminder of its impo-
tency to stop the slaughter of its planes assembled in
extraordinary session the atmosphere of the chamber
was one of gloom and despair my pilots and i were
called in to recite the incidents of our battle with the
foe

  the theory of captain price that this awful thing
may have a base in south america i think a sound
one said commander benson i believe that it
would be well to send planes to scout in that region
besides i believe that our secret service should be
doubled in every capital in the world although we
have just witnessed another example of the demons
cunning and power we feel that we are making some
progress toward its annihilation mr clare and his
pilots have demonstrated that the insulated planes are
invulnerable to its attacks and no plane so insulated has
been destroyed however i feel that our progress
toward the solution of this mighty problem is slow and
that unless we can hasten it the price we will pay for
our delay will stagger humanity therefore i earnestly
recommend that every available factory in the country
be run night and day for the construction and insula-
tion of military planes

  commander bensons recommendations were adopted
without one dissenting voice and then i asked for the
privilege of conducting another night patrol off boston
this was in obedience to a hunch rather than to any
definite analyses not knowing when or where the
demon would strike next one patrol district would
seem as likely to produce results as another however
the startling sequence of events proved that sometimes
a hunch may be right

  we took the air night after night and nothing hap-

pened to us for a week but in the meantime over the
land we continued to lose planes-sometimes singly
and other times whole flights and then one sunday
night our luck turned

  the weather was magnificent the full moon rode
high flooding the sea with silver as we swung out
over it the sky was clear with only a few billowy
clouds to freckle its velvety star-strewn dome those
clouds which drifted lazily along in a light breeze were
scattered and irregular in size but off to the right
only a few miles from shore was a group of these
foggy clouds their vhite fluffy banks and ridges stand-
ing clear and bright in the soft light there were no
others near them they were of about the same size
and shape and as we passed i watched them curi-
ously and counted them there were seven

  we went on for some time no one had spoken-
doubtless every one was under the mystic spell of the
mellow night then i noticed price staring fixedly
to the rear suddenly he rubbed his eyes and seized
the binoculars

  look there boys he exclaimed a moment later
i just counted those clouds when we passed-there
were seven-and now there are but four and-and
-for the love of god look in their place are three
white planes-the planes of the blue demon-and they
are being attacked

  unable to believe our eyes we stared like fools
above the three white planes had suddenly appeared
as though projected from empty space the great craft
that had escaped us before

  theres our baby again exclaimed collins glee-
fully weve got him this time or im a lubber
then he swiftly turned the plane back

  and now as we approached them we saw that amaz-
ing blue fire blaze and flash and circle about the plane
as it bore down on the white fleet then one after
another the remaining four clouds vanished suddenly
leaving in their places four more white planes

  we stared at one another speechless with amazement
there were now seven white planes each the exact
counterpart of the one we had forced down on that
sandy island they had moved unseen within a mantle
of clouds-and one of the great mysteries about our
foe was solved under cover of their cloud screen
they had approached their victims and struck them
down by means of some infernal power

  what dumbheads we all are i exclaimed in dis-
gust why didnt some fool among us discover that
we lost no planes during clear weather-that clouds
were always about 

  but what about that fellow that seems to be all
afire asked price is he friend or foe foe im
thinking for he ran from us probably he is the leader
and yet-

  the captain paused for want of words

  we came to a hovering stop less than five hundred
yards from the white planes two of them suddenly
rtose-dived to the sea then as the remaining five
zoomed and dipped and banked in their mad efforts to
escape the same fate their aggressor gained altitude
with a swift upward surge he quickly wheeled to
the left and brought all five white planes upon his
quarter again his plane blazed with blue and green
and yellow fire and three more of the white planes
whose cloud curtain had been mysteriously dissolved
went lurching down and were swallowed by the waves

  and now we were surprised to see the two remaining
planes unmindful of the awful power flashing from
their adversary charge straight at him but before
the blue demon	

they were fairly under way one of them began to
wobble then it dove straight into the air only to drop
back in a moment in a tail-spin to the sea

  it now became a death struggle between the re-
maining white plane and its terrible antagonist still
hovering there inactive not knowing who was friend
or foe if either and expecting to be attacked by the
victor we stared silently at the remarkable battle in
some strange manner the white plane although now
the center of the aggressors attack managed to parry
his fiery thrusts and to return again and again to the
attack for the first time we noticed a pale blue ray
dart intermittently from the cabin of the white plane
then we suddenly realized that its great foe had been
hard hit no longer the fire flashed from its wings
and fuselage it began to retreat at an upward angle
before the thrusts of its enemy three times it re-
turned and attempted to ram the white plane which
always eluded it but we could see that the white
plane also was badly crippled its movements had
become slower and they lacked their usual skill

  suddenly the big plane drew away from its white foe
it rose higher and higher with a slow unsteady motion
while we followed at a distance and the white plane
kept climbing and circling after it a hundred yards
below it then to our utter amazement we saw a
man emerge from the cabin of the upper plane walk
out upon a wing and pause there staring down at his
enemy a blue smoke was issuing from the fuselage
behind him and the whole plane was trembling and
swaying as if about to fall the man was without a
parachute and we wondered what he had in mind as
he continued to gaze down at the circling plane why
the latter did not finish him off as he stood there a
fair and open target we could not imagine but likely
its pilots were hard pressed to keep the plane in the air

an astounding discovery

the white plane still circled closer in its narrow-
ing orbit passing directly under the man on the
wing suddenly we saw him gather himself for a
spring

  my god he is going to jump i cried aghast he
is going to leap to the other plane

  then as we stared in dumb and silent awe he sprang
into the air straight down he plunged and he had
gauged the planes motion well for he alighted squarely
on his feet in the center of its wing he swung him-
self down to the cabin and entered by an open door
a few hoarse cries reached us mingled with the clank
of metal striking metal then all was silence but in
a moment the plane staggered into a nose dive for
a thousand feet it dove as we followed after and we
thought that it was surely about to crash into the sea
yet after a moment it flattened out and turned toward
the land

  a sudden mighty rush of air now thrust us aside
and the great plane which had just been abandoned
careening madly from side to side rushed past us
and buried itself in the ocean intent on watching the
white plane we had forgotten it momentarily and came
near being crushed by it

  meanwhile the crippled white plane paying no at-
tention to us was painfully making its way toward the
land with crazy uncertain glides it was evident that
its navigator was nearly spent and was seeking a haven
of refuge on land at last he reached the shore just
grazing the top of the cliffs and came to a crushing
stop in a stony field a quarter of a mile inland

as soon as possible we landed by the side of the

wrecked plane and rushed forward the first human
figures we saw were two turbaned orientals dressed
like the two we had vanquished one glance and we
saw that both were dead each had a smile of devilish
defiance on his dark face a smile of haughtiness and
disdain and their wide-open staring eyes held no shadow
of fear hurriedly we looked for their intrepid con-
queror then we saw him lying on his face wedged
in between the pilots seat and the instrument board
where he doubtless had fallen when the plane struck
blood was flowing freely from a wound on his head
but he was breathing collins and price pulled him
out and laid him on the ground beside the cabin and
then as i bent over him my senses reeled drunkenly
and for a moment i doubted the evidence of my eyes
for i was gazing at the rugged honest face of lon
grand

  good god boys i gasped this is my long-
lost friend  this is lon grand

  they stared at me incredulously

  he was fighting our battles said price at last
and to think that just a short time ago we were try-
ing to send him down to davy jones

  we must get him to a hospital at once said the
ever-ready and resourceful collins as he knelt to bind
his handkerchief about lons bleeding head price
he continued placing his hands beneath lons shoul-
ders you take his feet

  we soon had lon aboard our plane then as the ex-
cited natives of the locality ran up we shot into the
air and headed for portsmouth the site of the nearest
hospital on the way we radioed to the air depart-
ment to secure the wrecked plane

  it took heroic work to save lons life although he
had no severe wounds or injuries save that on his
head for weeks he lay in a coma but at last science
and tender nursing prevailed and he came out of the
shadows-came from under the mental cloud that had
possessed him so long calm reason without a glint
of fear doubt or uncertainty now glowed in his splen-
did eyes doubtless the blow he had received in that
last mad fight had proved his mental salvation

  day after day and often far into the night i had sat
by his bedside praying that his life be spared i left
the work of the air patrol to others but it was now
without particular interest for the attacks of the blue
demon had entirely ceased but so frail was lons
hold on life and so fearful were the doctors that any
sudden excitement might again unbalance his mind that
it was another month before i was allowed to reveal
myself to him and ask him to tell his story

  it is but a simple tale clare he said modestly as
he gazed fondly into my eyes i sat by his wheel-chair
holding his hand in a warm clasp i am sorry that
i have been unable to tell it to you sooner for now it
may be too late unless- he paused and looked at
me with a whimsical smile unless your insulated
plane has turned the trick he finished

  you have turned the trick yourself lon i said
warmly you alone saved us but we are just dying
to know how you have wrought this miracle we have
lost no more planes since that last heroic battle of
yours i reckon the blue demon is sleeping

  the blue demon repeated lon reflectively well
the name is appropriate enough but i cant under-
stand why they have let up in their attacks still there
are many other things about this strange enemy of
ours that i cant understand one thing i do not posi-
tively know-its identity think of it-i who have
lived among the conspirators supped and slept with
	air wonder stories

them-cannot with certainty name their nation so
i leave the enigma for each man to form his own
opinion

  to go back to the beginning resumed lon after
a pause we all know how the invention of your plane
completely vanquished our enemies from the east
beaten and humiliated it was natural for them to at
tempt to learn the secret of its construction but the
ironclad discipline of our governments air forces pre-
vented this you know old pal how i wandered away
from you in the clutch of one of my queer spells before
the war was over this time my aberration must have
lasted for weeks and months i can recall only hazy
glimmerings of my life and actions for some time i
do not know just what happened to me but i must have
been drugged and kidnapped

  when at last my senses returned in a measure i
found myself in a wild mountainous country contain-
ing dense forests and great level plains i was sur-
prised to find that my companions were orientals be-
longing to a proud and ancient caste now banished by
their government i was treated graciously housed in
comfortable quarters and given to understand that they
were my friends then came the great surprise their
head man a rajah tall and proud and powerful came
to see me he informed me bluntly that since i knew
the secrets of my countrys great airplane i was to
reveal it to him and to assist him and his followers in
the building of planes like it he also politely gave
me to understand that unless this information were
forthcoming within a reasonable time my life was to
pay the forfeit

  well i begged for time to consider this startling
proposition and while debating it i was allowed to
roam around at will then it was that i made some
astounding discoveries

  the little valley where i was held a prisoner har-
bored a town of several thousand people and in its
center ready for operation was an airplane factory
in which the whole population was expected to work
i discovered that this was an inaccessible region in the
north of india unknown to the outside world and sel-
dom visited it was presided over by this rajah who
i take it was a sort of social outcast from his particular
caste he was a merciless despot but everybody there
seemed to worship him and worked uncomplainingly
under his iron rule hazy as my mind was i gathered
that this worthy was in the pay and confidence of some
powerful eastern nation and that he was to turn the
new planes when finished over to it thus this power
while presenting a friendly face to the united states
was secretly planning its destruction

  at last i pretended to fall in with their plan but
under one subterfuge and another i delayed the work

i didnt know-what to do but i was determined to sac-
rifice my life rather than betray my country but i
wanted to live gain the secrets of this strange band of
men and aid in preserving my country fate helped
to solve my problem one evening just at twilight
while returning alone from a stroll in the valley i saved
from assassins the life of a young oriental of good
breeding education and intelligence a low-caste
laborer for some fancied injury was about to stab him
to the heart when i stepped between them receiving a
flesh wound in my own chest the young man rel-
goon by name from that time on was my friend so
to him i gradually imparted my desire to outwit my
captors to escape and to reveal their secrets to my
government he agreed readily to aid me and with a
solemn oath pledged his life to my cause

  at last a model of one of our super-planes was
started i built it as near like ours as  could remem-
ber but i introduced some changes the plane was
hardly under way when we were visited by a fleet of
beautiful white planes all manned by members of the
band i was taken on board one of the planes and
given a ride in the air i was frankly told that these
planes possessed some remarkable features far superior
to the american planes which they wished me to study
and incorporate in the plane i was building i was
shown the apparatus of the invisible death ray they
carried which was capable of killing a man at the dis-
tance of two thousand yards which could be intensified
and directed at a minute target

  most astounding of all they possessed a devilish
contrivance to screen their movements this was a
machine for generating a fog cloud which they could
keep about them as they sailed and in which they could
lie concealed for hours especially when blended with
the real clouds of the sky yet through this cloud they
could send their ray directing it by means of some
hellish electric eyes which i was never able to discover
and copy-my old think-box functions but poorly at
times

  now relgoon and i working hand in hand set
out not only to equal these damnable instruments but
also to improve and surpass them you know old
scout that i have always been quite apt in the field of
electromagnetism so while neglecting to build a cloud
creator in the new plane-giving as my reason that
owing to the planes peculiar construction it would be
best to install it the very last thing-and remembering
that one of the most obstinate elements menacing the
safety and navigation of all planes is fog we created a
fog dissolver

  when the plane was ready for the air but still in-
complete in equipment i invited the rajah and several
of his officers aboard and we went for a trial flight
the plane surpassed all my calculations it behaved
superbly responding to all maneuvers with marvelous
speed and precision the rajah was delighted he
rubbed his hands together in glee i fancy in anticipa-
tion of some nations gold that was soon to cross his
palm while he was in this good humor i disclosed
my new dissolver casually reminding him that fog was
one of the most troublesome and dangerous of the
obstacles of aviation i desired to try out the invention
and if successful to install it on our new planes he
was favorably impressed with the idea and by radio
he ordered one of the white planes to approach us
shrouded in its cloud mantle little dreaming that i
was negotiating the collapse of his golden dream

  in due time the plane appeared in its glorious white
cloud i pointed the dissolver and lo its fog was
shattered and the plane revealed in a twinkling nor
could the plane again build up its cloud under the
attack of my rays

  the rajah was prodigal in his praise as we returned
to town he was immensely gratified that my work
had merged without friction into all his plans i was
given more freedom and was accorded every honor
that the little band possessed

the escape

 a t last the plane was complete even to the intro-
duction of the projector which sends out the ray
with its poisoning power and its peculiar hue but
like a fool at the last minute i neglected to install the
fog producer i was in such a big hurry to get away
secretly bit by bit relgoon and i provisioned the plane
the blue demon

and made it ready for a long voyage then during
one dark night of rain and wind when the sentinels
had sought shelter from the storm while the few lights
of the city blinked dimly through the mist and the
people of the town were asleep we stole over to the
hangar doped and bound the guards ran out the plane
and zoomed up through the rain

  we made but little headway during the night but
by morning the storm having lifted we sailed out over
the pacific cruising along the islands of japan we
encountered heavy fog banks but by means of our dis-
solves which cut a clear path through the vapor fifty
yards wide and about five hundred yards long we sailed
through it easily without slackening speed

  three days later we landed among the cactus of
northern mexico because we were forced down by
motor trouble to avoid arousing the suspicion of
the natives and being subjected to unpleasant question-
ing we represented ourselves as united states military
aviators but owing to the remoteness of the region
and the indolence and the red tape of the officials it
was over a month before we were repaired and again
took the air then we were stunned to learn of colonel
brandons sad fate i saw how it was-the mysterious
eastern power learning of our escape and fearing that
we would soon warn our country had determined to
rely on the prowess of their own devilish contraptions
and destroy our planes one by one before they could be
warned

  why i did not immediately reveal myself and my
plane to the proper authorities is one of the great puz-
zles of my mental illness i was aflame with indigna-
tion and hate against this sneaking unseen foe of my
country which i can not even name and relgoon
shared my hatred so immediately we set out to hunt
and destroy these white planes which though deprived
of our inventions had nevertheless set out to destroy
us but we had a great advantage unknown to the
enemy secretly i had greatly increased the power of
the ray and added other little tricks that were sure to
help us

  i had an obsession to locate the base of those white
devils and lead our planes upon them but there were
delays we had hard work to keep from being dis-
covered to get supplies and find a snug haven for our
plane and in the meantime our planes were being
destroyed yet i hesitated to make myself known
my wayward mind kept suggesting that i first locate
the enemys base but so cleverly is that base con-
cealed that only a few days before my last fight did
we discover it and then i regret to say my faithful
relgoon lost his life you will find that base in a cove
of pamlico sound where a good-sized stream empties
into the cove its mouth hidden by low overhanging
live oaks heavily covered with festoons of spanish
moss here is the entrance to the invaders haven
this haven is never entered or left by the planes save
at night and then under cover of their clouds it is
not a mechanical base-only a few supplies are kept
and their gas is supplied by night-prowling launches
with crews in the pay of this unknown power go at
once i beg of you and destroy this outer harbor of
hell

  lon sank back exhausted and closed his eyes

  within an hour preparations were going forward to
descend on this base of the terrible white planes and
before nightfall a fleet comprising the cream of our
insulated military planes took off for the south

  i need only to add that the base was found abandoned
our subtle enemy of the east whoever it might have
been doubtless cowed and alarmed by lons heroic
battle and the impregnability of the insulated planes
and convinced that the game was up had ceased its
operations utterly

  as lon and his companion had left the mountain
rendezvous in india at night he was never able to locate
it again so no further particulars of this international
outrage were ever learned

  but the great work of my friend lon grand now
fully recovered and hale and hearty in the mellow years
of mid-life goes steadily forward today he is one
of the worlds leading aviation engineers

flight of the eastern star

by the author of beyond gravitythe stellar missilethe radium pool etc

r many years i had planned to fly around
the world in one of the gigantic interna-
tional airway express liners but not until
recently had i been able to adjust my
affairs so that they would not require my
personal attention for a few weeks at least how-
ever during the years there had appeared safer
and speedier aero-transportation so when i was
ready to make the flight i felt assured of a passage
not only with the utmost safety but
also with the maximum of comfort

the international airway express
company had even abandoned many
of iy huge landing fields and
adopted instead towering pylon-like
structures to which their leviathans
of the air were anchored by an ap-
plication of electromagnetism

  i was fortunate indeed in having
booked passage on the great eastern
star for if i had not i would have
missed the thrilling episodes that
followed the novel features of the
great craft many of them revolu-
tionary added to the excitement of
being able to fly on her maiden trip

i was eager to be off and an hour
before her scheduled arrival from
the cast i was in the los angeles
station at the base of the anchoring
pylon located in the center of the plaza this his-
torical spot in the center of old los angeles had been
purchased by the international airway express com-
pany in  but not until recently had the space been
utilized as the location for the anchoring towers

  on arriving at the station i went at once to the
office of the pacific coast manager of the company
jackson worthington my former college chum as
i entered he was seated at his desk staring into a large
luminous screen which was placed at a convenient
angle before him he glanced up

 hello tom he

ed earl repp

said rising to grasp my
hand i had not seen
jack for several years
and at once i noted that
his temples were grayer
and new lines on his
pleasant features told
more eloquently than
words the responsibility
of his job i see youre
listed as a passenger
why didnt you come to
me for your reservation
how are you anyhow

you old-

  i feel the need of ex-
citement jack i cut in
wringing his hand heart-
ily i didnt think it
necessary to cause you a
lot of inconvenience so
i had my secretary book
my passage outside of
overwork im as fit as
i was when we put it

  t f the old rowans could come back and 
   i compare their galleys with the present trans-
   atlantic greyhounds of some  tons
   capacity they probably could not believe their
   own eyes

       so we of today looking at our great airplanes
    find it difficult to realize how puny they will
    seem when compared with the aircraft of the
    future

       there is no question that the future airliner
    will be as big as our biggest ocean greyhound of
    today and even bigger when the secrets of
    aero-dynamics aerial navigation and all that
    goes with them have been mastered

      with such a future realized our well-known
    author has recounted an exciting voyage of a
    great airliner

      to be sure an ocean voyage on a steamer
   is a prosaic affair today but every once in a
   while we have miraculous adventures-such
   as when the president roosevelt saved the
   crew of a freighter during a storm in mid-ocean
   you will find plenty of such excitement and
   kadventure in our authors latest effort

over gayle remember it jack 

his eyes sparkled as he motioned me to a chair
do i he ejaculated smiling reminiscently that
was the game that made history for bingham i still
carry the scars of that battle i could have murdered
that big brute of a half-back for spiking me

  it was a dirty trick all right i acknowledged
remembering vividly the incident a gayle player many
years before had spiked jack in the side in an effort
to put our star out of the game
but its all in the game youve got
to expect slams in almost every-
thing

   i suppose so he said seriously
but what the devil made you decide
on a trip around the world busi-
ness or pleasure

  pleasure jack old boy i an-
swered handing him a cigar of my
private brand im getting stale
and i want to make the flight before
im too old ive only had three
trips to europe and one to hawaii
and i couldnt enjoy em because
there was too much business to oc-
cupy my mind now ive managed
to clean things up a bit so that i
have nothing to worry about for
a while

  well ill change your reserva-
tion for you tom he said laying a hand on my
knee a bachelor like you will want to fly in comfort
i had a chance to take back the no  cabin on the
eastern star its yours now if you want it youll be
well up forward and ill arrange with captain mark-
son to show you everything you wont be lonesome
and i assure you that theres a thrill in every mile
what kind of a ship is this eastern star jack i
inquired i dont recall that ive ever seen the pic-
tures of her

first class ultra-modern airliner tom he an-
swered with pride in his

voice shes the finest
airship ever built and the
fastest you leave los
angeles at six oclock
this afternoon you are
in tokio at ten tomorrow
night even after losing
twenty-four hours by the
change at the date line
i suppose youll want
stop-over privileges 
thats fine jack i
said yes id like to
stop in london for a few
days you see i in-
tended to be away for
about fifteen days in all
but im allowing myself
three weeks in event of
any unforeseen delays

the position locator

a buzzer sounded
somewhere under
his desk worthington
	air wonder stories

turned to regard the illuminated screen my eyes fol-
lowed his and i beheld on the surface of the oblong
device hundreds of tiny moving specks i leaned for-
ward to observe them closely the specks were the
locations of aircraft in flight i was astonished and
regarded the screen with curiosity i saw the familiar
coast lines of the united states canada at the north
loomed almost solid except for the occasional hair-like
lines that revealed her rivers the great lakes fairly
glistened gazing toward the east i beheld the rugged
coast line of maine then an area which seemed fairly
liquid stood between the atlantic seaboard of the
united states and the british isles to represent the
atlantic ocean here and there over the land and
water shadings were the tiny specks that revealed the
exact locations of every aircraft in flight over the ter-
ritory exposed on the uncanny screen

  jack worthington regarded their movements for an
instant and with a finger he traced the forward mo-
tion of a small speck it seemed to glow intermittently
as though signalling by flash he grasped a small
disc-like object from a hook and placed it to his ear
with his free hand he pulled closer to him another
small round object that stood on a low pedestal i con-
tinued to watch the flashing of the dot on the screen

  los angeles talking he said into the instrument
whats wrong eastern star

  there was a brief pause and i allowed my gaze to
wander to the features of my friend

  forty-five minutes delay jack worthington said
how come

  another pause

  rocky mountain updraft eh said jack frowning
well you can make up the lost time from los angeles
west tell captain markson that the company wont
tolerate too many delays all ships coming west will
have to swing off the regular route east of denver and
come around the up-draft your route is dangerous
and the delays are costly

  he swung his swivel chair around and faced me
again his features seemed sober and serious

  that damned rocky mountain up-draft causes us
more trouble than all the air-pockets from here to
japan tom he said shaking his head some days
the atmosphere over the colorado peaks are as free
from up or down suctions as the air is over los angeles
on other occasions aircraft are sucked into them and
are drawn either upward or downward theres no
way of foretelling what sort of atmospheric movements
are going on in that region

  why doesnt the company re-route the course
then  i asked abstractedly

  because our franchise permits us only ten miles
leeway on either side of our regulated airlane he re-
plied every time we swung off that course the
occidental people on one side of us and the trans-
continental company on the other make a kick to the
federal aviation commission against us for violating
their franchises its enough to cause a man to go in-
sane trying to figure out just how to keep our pas-
sengers and ships in safety when they reach the treach-
erous air-stream regions

  thats quite an instrument you have there jack
i said nodding at the screen

  international holds all patents to that position lo-
cator he said it is somewhat of an invention
although little has yet been said about it on it we
can locate every one of our ships in the air no matter
where they are if rival ships are equipped with low-
wave detectors we can also spot their positions each

one of our ships broadcasts continuously on private
wavelengths by noctotelevision which gives us their
location over any part of the globe we have ships in
the air practically everywhere you know and with our
own detector we can get the location of every ship in
half the world at a time

  he faced the instrument again and twisted a small
dial on a panel underneath the screen its glow died
for an instant and then across it flashed a new map

  there he said with finality you see the other
side of the globe from los angeles to cairo heres
the hawaiian islands farther west is the orient
japan here and china there further on there is man-
churia siberia and russia over there these white
dots are international airway express ships while all
others belong to rival companies see the immensity
of the pacific tom even looking at this makes you
think of her beauty do you know that the old pacific
is very much like some of our modern types of
women 

  hows that jack i asked with a grin i know
very little about women

  beautiful but treacherous he answered with a
laugh shes the siren of all water bodies but like
woman she is necessary to man we cant keep away
from the pacific despite the fact that more ships have
been lost on her than all the other oceans put together
once lost in the pacific you are lost indeed we know
that up-drafts and down-drafts exist over the rockies
but we can never tell whats going to pop up over the
pacific yet international has been fortunate in com-
bating these unseen obstacles in later years ive often
wondered what becomes of the aircraft lost over the
pacific

  perhaps some day well find out jack i said with
a trace of alarm you dont suppose theres any

chance of the eastern star-

  jack worthington patted my knee and laughed
none in the world tom he replied you neednt
have any fear of a ship like the eastern star getting
lost i didnt mean to cause you any apprehension
with my ponderings forget it and enjoy your flight
theres nothing to worry about the eastern star
has gone through the most exacting tests

the captain explains

jackson worthington was always the per-
sonification of kindness whether the fact that
we had been college chums made any difference i do
not know but he arranged for me to see everything
and as we waited for the eastern star to loom into
view each passing minute served to increase my im-
patience at the delay i wanted to be off- i was as

anxious to be away from the scenes of my brain-killing
business as a youngster waiting for vacation time

  after half an hour of waiting i was becoming ill-
humored i stared about the waiting room on the
ground level just under the anchoring pylon and for
the tenth time i noticed the two elevators which
nestled in a corner ready to take their loads of pas-
sengers upward some six hundred feet i glared with
baleful eyes at a small pale man the announcer who
sat at a switchboard near an open exposure fingering
a row of push-buttons frequently he gazed through
the window at the sky exposed before him and i could
tell by the impatient look on his wizened features that
the eastern star had not yet put in her appearance
somehow i had a baseless feeling that he alone was
to blame for the delay of the air leviathan and added
to the fact that i strangely disliked his looks i felt
flight of the eastern star	

almost like grabbing him by the collar and casting him
through the window i was angry at the ships delay
angry and ill-humored at the beginning of the adven-
ture i suppose my days of bachelorhood had created
within me a certain temperament that could be satisfied
only by instantaneous compliance with my wishes

  suddenly the little man spoke into a tube and the
room reverberated with the rasping sound of his am-
plified voice

  eastern star forty-five minutes late is now nosing
down to anchor passengers will deposit their hand
baggage with the checker for delivery on board the
liner the eastern star will take off in exactly
eighteen minutes tokio first landing all aboard
there was a sudden scramble toward the elevators
at a signal from the operators the little man pressed
a button on his keyboard and the doors closed the
lifts were moving upward rapidly i shot a glance
toward the stations great windows a deep shadow
was darkening the space and i felt a slight jar as the
huge ships nose came into contact with the electro-
magnetic plates which drew her downward to anchor
my ship had arrived at last but i waited on the ground
for jack worthington until the rush for the elevators
had ceased though i was anxious to see the surface
appearance of the eastern star

  presently jack ushered me to one of the lifts at once
we were wafted upward and deposited on the closed
platform a ships officer was waiting on the landing
glancing nervously at his wrist watch he looked up
and bowed to jack worthington who was mumbling
something to himself about the expense of a forty-five-
minute delay far below the din of busy city life
clanged irritatingly in my ears even though the sound
was muffled by the enclosure there was the clatter
and scraping of baggage as the two-score handlers
lifted it from the express elevators and shot it down
into the liner over bearinged ramps and through com-
pressed-air chutes then as i understood it would
be sorted out in the ship and labeled according to its
destination - tokio peiping nanking calcutta and
other points

  captain markson a rather large muscular man with
gray hair and steady blue eyes appeared and addressed
my friend

  im mighty sorry mr worthington he said seri-
ously but with a trace of nervousness in his manner
but i think i can make up that forty-five minutes
once i get up in the rarefied-air regions

  of course you can captain jack replied smiling
with a lightness that i knew was forced what hap-
pened to you over the rockies

  we were cruising along at our regular clip the
captain explained when we ran head on into an up-
draft some miles east of their usual area i hadnt
expected a suction-stream so far east i was in for it
before i knew but we managed to fight out of it
without any damage although about half the passengers
are almost nervous wrecks theres a lot of old women
on board you know mostly school teachers from the
middle west wanting to see the orient from the air
anyhow the up-draft was not as severe as some i
have encountered in the past but it took forty-five
minutes of steady fighting to keep from being lifted
beyond our altitude limit and get out of it

  there must be quite a blow over the rockies cap-
tain  i put in

  worse than an ordinary blow sir he replied
positively theres no comparison between an up-
r down-draft and a blow

  this is my friend mr rodman captain markson
jack said by way of introduction take care of him
aboard show him everything and give him the run
of the ship

  captain markson grasped my hand tightly and wrung
it with friendly warmth

  glad to have you along mr rodman he said
im sure you will enjoy the flight theres everything
on the eastern star that is needed to keep a man
comfortable and happy

  any fascinating widows aboard captain markson
asked jack slyly and glancing my way i felt my
cheeks burn jack worthington winked and the captain
nodded pleasantly

  i repeat that the eastern star boasts of everything
required to keep a man happy he said smiling

  just the same gentlemen i replied feeling some-
what nervous at the thought of enforced association
with nervous females of uncertain age i dont think
ill be much interested in your lady passengers ill
stick with the officers since i may

      chapter ii
      the eastern star

y	friend laughed loudly he then turned to the
captain and addressed him seriously

  theres a valuable consignment of gold bul-
lion being put aboard captain markson he said in a
low tone it must be delivered at peiping by 
a m local time thursday if you fail in making
delivery by that hour the company will lose the
 guarantee which we have given against delay
dont worry mr worthington the captain re-
plied well arrive in peiping hours before that
the bullion will be delivered on time

  a uniformed officer brought the ships clearance
papers the captain glanced at his chronometer im-
patient to be off then he turned to his superior

  does anyone know about the consignment mr
worthington he asked

  none but the shippers the consignees and the three
of us captain jack replied why

  oh i just wondered if there were any chance of a
raid upon the gold the captain returned well-
there wont be any up-drafts to delay us between here
and peiping sir well make it in plenty of time ill
let you know of anything unforeseen good-bye mr
worthington well take good caie of your friend
hell take care of himself well enough if you allow
him captain jack said nodding

  never had a nurse male or fenlale in all my life
jack i grinned i can get along all right providing
the captain gives me a bodyguard to keep his foot-loose
schoolmaams away from me

  then you stick close to first officer madden and
the women will let you alone jack said good-humor-
edly hes got the ugliest face in the whole universe
but hes a better sport than a dozen average men put
together even though hes not a ladies man

  thats about right gentlemen captain markson
laughed youll be safe with madden adios mr
worthington

  good-bye captain jack replied and turned to me
let me know if any of the men or officers on the
eastern star fail to treat you right ill fire em on
the spot and see if you cant walk some -of that
paunch off you-he poked me playfully-have a
good time tom be sure to see me when you get
back
	air wonder stories

  a gong clanged somewhere in the interior of the
eastern star i stepped down the passageway lead-
ing into the craft from the platform captain markson
followed close behind he pressed a signal button as
he entered the open side of the ship and i heard some
unseen machinery hum softly i glanced back in time
to see two heavy steel doors sliding together there was
a soft snap as they locked tightly

  the interior of the ship where i stood beside captain
markson seemed to be an arched passageway the walls
were spotlessly enamelled and the floor thickly car-
peted the captain led me well toward the center and
paused before a row of small elevators one of which
soon whisked us upward to the main deck i was sur-
prised at the luxury manifest in the decorations of the
eastern star on every hand stood massive divans
upholstered chairs thick oaken tables finished beauti-
fully the walls were adorned with paintings and
tapestry no great hotel was more lavishly decorated
than this expansive salon before me i was elated
for here was comfort indeed

  the salon seemed strangely vacant however and i
presumed that somewhere in the ship there must be
a deck from which passengers could look down to earth
and wave adieu to their loved ones as the craft moved
away from her anchoring pylon but before i could
inquire of captain markson if there were such an
eyrie he addressed me

  would you like to come up into the control room
to watch the take-off mr rodman  he asked we
cast off in another minute

  you bet captain i i said id like to watch it
i followed him out of the reception cabin along a
well-lighted and roomy passageway toward the nose
of the ship we went up a flight of carpeted stairs
and entered a large circular room over which seemed
to be a dome of thick transparent glass a dozen
uniformed officers stood at various posts in the com-
bination bridge and control room a man wearing a
braided visor stepped forward and saluted snappily
all ready captain i he said what orders sir
signal the ground man to break the magnetic con-
tact madden captain markson said crisply start
the electromagnetic power distributors for the usual
vertical take-off rise to  feet and set the course
indicator at --

  very good sir madden turned to a control
panel

  i was not disappointed in maddens famous visage
it is no injustice to a gallant officer to say that he is
indisputably ugly though it is only an uncouthness of
features for to offset it the pleasant twinkle in his
pale eyes seems to compensate whatever natural an-
tipathy the unusual set of his features aroused he is
not repellent mind you he has an odd personality
to make him respected by a man if not admired by the
gentler sex and as i learned to know the man in the
later hours of the flight i found that he is an excel-
lent officer a fine navigator and-as jack worthington
had said-a good sport should i ever need a friend
in a pinch a real man in a tight place i will select
madden to stand by me in place of a score of those
loose-lipped apollo-faced gentleman of the ballroom
variety

the near-catastrophe

it was madden who was first at the control when
the unexpected thing occurred and it was madden
who brought the eastern star to an even keel when
her nose suddenly dipped earthward under the pressure

of her driving exhausts just how the near-catastrophe
happened when the ship cast herself free from the
anchoring tower  do not know although  learned
later that one of the four pilots had neglected to test
the elevators to make sure that they were in position
for upward flight as the result of this negligence
before the eastern star had risen to the necessary
-foot level her nose shot earthward at a terrific
clip under the power of her exhausts i was thrown
into a corner by the abrupt dive of the ship as her tail
lifted skyward  had one glance through the observa-
tion windows of the control cabin and saw the earth
rushing up rapidly then i caught sight of madden
who-with a bound like the spring of a panther at a
victim-leaped aside and grasped a reserve elevation-
control wheel

  the eastern stars nose missed the tops of the build-
ings by inches rather than feet then with a force
that caused her interior bracing girders to groan under
the pressure of a sudden upward thrust it swung up
while her keel grazed a spire opposite the plaza the
ship seemed to leap into the air almost perpendicularly

  with my arms locked around a rigid stationary pilot
chair i clung in this precarious position to prevent my-
self from being hurled to the far end of the cabin it
was like hanging by the arms from a horizontal bar
legs dangling fearfully i glanced upward frantic
officers were clinging to various handholds struggling
to maintain equilibrium only madden seemed cool as
he stood braced at the chair to which i clung i could
not see his face yet i felt that if the ship should escape
total destruction and those on board and in her path
below be spared then madden alone could be thanked

  i saw him loosen a foot from its anchor around the
chair his boot scraped on the metallic floor as it
sought a signal pedal to increase the power of the
driving exhausts which i was to learn propelled the
eastern star with a jerk the huge air leviathan
leaped upward skimming the roof of the rebuilt hall
of justice simultaneously with the sudden upward
thrust i heard the roar of her exhausts as they shot
peculiar jets of pale blue flame rearward from below
her tail laterals then she floated on an even keel
and i arose shaking

  captain markson stood in the center of the cabin
legs planted apart and arms akimbo again in com-
mand during the few long seconds when our lives
hung in the balance i had not seen him once his face
was now livid and his mouth twisted in a rage

  madden he shrieked stay at the wheel
walton blunt wilson and baker come here

  i mopped the perspiration from my brow with a
shaking hand while madden tensed at the controls
and the four pilots whom he had called detached them-
selves from the maze of instruments before them and
dejectedly faced the captain i glanced earthward
throngs of onlookers filled main and spring streets
looking like white dotted insects as they stared upward
at the huge ship i heard madden growling to him-
self and i looked at him his face was calm enough
and his senses entirely under control but he was
mumbling of dire things to perform on the persons of
certain negligent pilots who had permitted the near-
catastrophe to happen just what had caused it i was
soon to learn for captain markson bellowed with
mounting rage

  what in hell do you fellows mean by neglecting to
test your elevators before your ship is put under way
he roared which one of you is to blame what
kind of pilots are you-correspondence-school gradu-
flight of the

ates or just elementary students havent you been
drilled to test every one of your controls after landing
why did you neglect to lift your elevators after we
anchored  are you all so damned ignorant  answer
me you-

bakers choice

an utterly dejected young pilot stepped forward
and saluted captain markson frowned on him
and raised an arm as though to strike him full in the
face but he controlled himself and raged his ham-
like lists twisting perilously close to the officers fright-
ened features

  speak you idiot-you murderer captain markson
bellowed wrathfully

  the officers lips quivered for an instant before his
words finally came forth

  it was my fault sir he said tensely his face sickly
pale mr madden ordered me to take charge of
control one for the take-off it was my duty to test
the laterals and set them for upward flight sir it was
an accident that i overlooked it sir

  captain markson stared at the man curiously for an
instant and then blew up again

  so it was you baker he roared stepping back
to survey the negligent pilot of control one he
turned and tore from the wall of the control room one
of its framed certificates and thrust it at the pilot

  the man baker took it from him meekly and hung
his head

  youre through baker he said madden
swing around and circle the station once at landing
velocity baker you will report to mr worthington
for your check prepare for a chute landing at once
sir walton blunt and wilson return to your posts
pilot baker stood for an instant as though i rooted
to the floor unable to move then slowly he walked to
the parachute rack selected his own device and donned
it rapidly the other three pilots glad to have escaped
from the wrath of their commanding officer returned to
their various controls captain markson strode to my
side and peered intently through the observation ex-
posures then faced around

  as a civilian witness mr rodman he said you
will bear me out in this decision at the federal inquiry
you understand the situation as well as i do i would
make another landing if time permitted it but i can-
not afford to lose any more time we must reach
tokio and peiping without delay im sorry sir that
such damnable negligence has cursed my command

  i regarded him curiously his features were stern
and hard-set the eastern star was skirting the tower-
ing city hall obelisk her nose tipped slightly earth-
ward and i glanced around to observe baker he
was standing in the center of the floor before a com-
paratively small round hatch that yawned as the cover-
ing was thrown back and he was prepared to step into
the discharging cylinder the ship seemed to hover
over the anchoring towers for an instant with a last
look around the cabin baker faced captain markson
and saluted

  good-bye sir he said in half whisper that was
barely audible it will never happen again sir

  i dislike to discharge you this way baker captain
markson said his eyes softening for a second but
its for the good of the service and the protection of
aircraft passengers good-bye sir and good luck
baker eased himself into the tube which i discov-
ered was for the purpose of saving the lives of the
ships forward crew in event of accident that was

eastern star -	

true but it was no life-saving device for pilot baker
i shuddered as he passed from view haunted by the
look in his eyes as he glanced strangely toward me
captain markson peered earthward for a sight of float-
ing silk what he saw caused him to start violently
hurtling earthward was only a rapidly decreasing
speck pilot baker had elected to die rather than face
the disgrace that he knew was in store for him

  a whining siren caused me to jump nervously as i
watched the falling speck hoping to see the silken cloth
bulge upward i tore my eyes away captain markson
strode swiftly across the cabin and pressed a button
below a three-foot square screen it glowed with the
wrathful features of jackson worthington jacks
voice came through an amplifying reproducer to reach
every nook and cranny of the control room

  what the devils going on in your ship captain
markson  he demanded my god you caused a
panic that injured twenty people on the ground with
your crazy antics whats wrong markson 

  accidents have happened since man began to travel
sir captain markson replied tensely pilot baker
neglected to elevate and damn near smashed us up i
discharged him sir and sent him down in a parachute
i have already lost fifteen more minutes and i cannot
afford to make another landing i hope he arrived
safe

  he didnt markson the official growled the
field men are cleaning up the mess now what about
the inquiry

  i stepped to the captains side as he spoke again

  your friend mr rodman is a witness sir he
said evenly he will bear me up baker was given
a perfect chance to land safely but he chose the other
way i guess rather than face the notoriety and
disgrace

  thats right jack i put in edging close to the
screen so that my features would be transmitted to
him it was bakers negligence he confessed to it

  anyhow worthington said that doesnt let us
out of heavy damage suits there must be a curse on
the eastern star shes had nothing but bad luck
since we put her into service let me speak to mark-
son again

             chapter iii
             an inspection

 turned away to take up a post beside madden
intent upon watching the rapid progress of the
eastern star over the city of los angeles toward
the open expanse of the pacific i paid no further heed
to the conversation between markson and worthington
we passed scores of red-lighted beacons that flashed
brilliantly even in the late afternoon sun guiding
international airway express craft over their allotted
lines gradually the eastern star picked up speed
as she sped on her belated course to circumnavigate
the globe madden slowly increased her driving power
until a faint hiss reached me in the control cabin i
felt a desire to inspect the propulsion principles of the
huge craft but elected to await the time when the
excitement and ill-humor should have passed from the
minds of the officers in charge i wondered what had
transpired among the other passengers during those
few seconds of dire danger back at the station

  captain markson interrupted my thoughts by re-
lieving madden of the supervision of the controls
the first officer relinquished the post without a word
as though it were a usual thing for the captain to
 

air wonder stories

assume that duty

  ill take her until we get beyond the coast mad-
den captain markson said staring at the instru-
ments seems as if i cant trust anybody on this
ship of late anyhow the barometer indicates low
pressure over the pacific ill navigate her through it
very well sir madden replied shall i go
through the ship to see how the passengers have come
through it

  by all means sir the captain grumbled take
mr rodman with you and show him the ship mr
rodman this is first officer madden ill join you
later when i feel safe enough in turning the ship over
to these nincompoops

  madden smiled and led me out of the cabin and
down the corridor toward the reception room

  quite a close shave mr madden i said as we
strode side by side down the hall let me congratu-
late you upon your prompt action in saving the ship
from crashing sir

  all in the days work he replied quietly such
things are bound to happen at times i happened to be
the closest man to the reserve control any one of the
others might have done the same trick

  but they didnt i replied we would have been
killed without a doubt if your mind had not been
working rapidly

  thank you sir he said looking straight ahead
nothing about that though to warrant a hero medal
and baker was a damned good pilot-navigator  i
cant see how he overlooked the elevators

  seemed rather young to hold a pilots rating i
put in

  thirty-five is the best age for a pilot baker was
thirty been with the company just a short time how-
ever madden said

  married  i asked

  dont know sir the officer replied shaking his
head from what i could see he wasnt much of a
mixer that is he didnt confide much in his mess
the old man never did take much fancy to him he
didnt hop fast enough for captain markson the
captain is a flyer of the old school who flew ships when
aircraft still had struts to hold em together now
that we have all-cantilever ships he thinks the men
need the struts to keep em up on their feet

  panic had reigned temporarily among the pas-
sengers of the eastern star when her convolutions
threw them about in spite of the customary starting
precautions but when madden and myself had com-
pleted the tour of inspection we were elated to discover
that they had quieted down after the first scare and
most of them had retired to their cabins several had
suffered slight bruises and abrasions from the tumblings
they had received but on the whole things were in
much better condition than madden had anticipated

  well mr rodman madden said presently there
will be a few more minutes before your dinner time
if you are free id like to show you the mechanical
workings of the eastern star  i presume you are in-
terested to know just how she is propelled

  ive wondered about its mechanical embodiments
mr madden i replied ive always felt an interest
in mechanics physics and aero-dynamics although i
understand but little of any of the sciences if you
dont mind showing me around--

  we went down a short companionwav to the engine
rooms where powerful units of machinery hummed
as the great craft swung swiftly through the heavens
toward the northwest i was awestruck by the com-

pactness of the units for such a large craft i rather
expected to find the eastern stars machinery spread
all over an engine deck

  just inside the door behind a screen and extending
across the breadth of a room were immense batteries of
electrical units that fairly sputtered under a bombard-
ment of rapid-fire electrical charges which seemed to fly
from one post to another sizzling and crackling not un-
pleasantly they seemed alive with power thick
cables ran from each unit to a central manifold that
virtually glowed under cover of a green phosphores-
cence from the manifold extended another series of
cables heavily covered with a lead-like metal they
disappeared behind an unattended panel it was on
the tip of my tongue to inquire about them but mad-
den sensing my curiosity volunteered the information

  these bats distribute high-frequency current to
ignite the driving explosives he said simply the
cables run from here to another chamber in which are
housed the compression units in internal-combustion
engines a high-voltage spark is used to explode the
gases in the cylinders the eastern stars propulsion
principles are along the same lines yet instead of
gasoline paralene or other highly inflammable liquids
we use a combination of fuels in the form of a powder
which is driven into combustion chambers by centrif-
ugal pressure there the fuel is mixed with oxygen
exploded and driven through twelve separate units
forming the driving-exhaust systems you probably
noticed the exhaust tubes extending outward from the
rigid lateral platform at the tail

  no i havent mr madden i confessed frankly
ive never seen the eastern star or even her pictures
before

an amazing ship

he stared at me blankly as though questioning my
ignorance of this tremendous air leviathan
what he said incredulously youve never seen
this craft on her inspection tour around the country
i thought everybody had

  i am ashamed that i must confess my ignorance
again mr madden i replied

  then i will enjoy the pleasure of making you ac-
quainted with her sir he said it is rather odd that
a man of your position has not had a chance to investi-
gate such progress in aviation as this ship has de-
veloped

  ive been too busy in the last few months attending
to my own business affairs to look into others mr
madden i said but i welcome this opportunity
to learn something

  from the battery room we entered another
chamber a half dozen perspiring men stood beside
compact oblong cylinder blocks and watched the
gauges that rested on panels above them a low hum
like the almost inaudible purr of a new automotive
engine issued from each of the heavy steel units
there were in the room twelve such metal blocks
arranged horizontally across it by each stood huge
metal cylinders each individually attached to its block
by means of bright metallic tubing behind the blocks
ran another series of tubes that vanished into another
chamber toward the rear of the ship

  each one of these explosive blocks or units is cap-
able of producing  horsepower madden re-
marked continuing his interesting explanations these
cylinders contain fuel for immediate discharge into
the units the powder is ignited within the blocks
with no other outlet than the tubes behind them the
flight of the

power thus created is forced through the interior ex-
hausts carbon and other elements left uncombined
in the gases after they are first ignited are in turn
forced into a series of exploding chambers similar to
the first blocks where they are discharged with ter-
rific force the power thus derived wasting not a
single atom of any portion of the original fuel and
using even the neutral gases is exerted through the
exterior driving exhausts causing a backward pressure
which forces the ship forward at a terrific velocity

  using a catalyte of perellvum our fuel is utilized
by the addition of oxygen extracted from the atmos-
phere the real novelty of this ships propulsion prin-
ciples mr rodman is these explosive gases the other
features are secondary because they follow the well-
known principles of rocket propulsion other fuel-
producing equipment is contained in a forward chamber
where the air is treated with the small quantities of
pcrellium necessary the amazing feature of pereltium
is that each time it is ignited it forms a new explosive
compound of lesser but still great power thus we
can get almost an infinite number of explosions with
almost unlimited power as it is the power we get
from a unit quantity is many times greater than any
explosive heretofore known the great difficulty is
how to employ this great power to its full capacity
the eastern star does not utilize it all our mechanical
apparatus is not strong enough the man who can
create a new principle for the discharge of all the
power contained in that fuel will earn for himself a
greater fortune than the scientist who discovered the
method of producing the gases

  interesting mr madden i said very inter-
esting but isnt there a possibility of this powder
exploding itself in the tanks 

  madden grinned good-naturedly

  nomore than gasoline in an automobile tank will
ignite itself mr rodman he said like gasoline
our powdered fuel needs the high-voltage ignition spark
to discharge it there is no possibility of such a
disaster

  i trust not i said

  let me show you our electromagnetizing units sir
he said they are really interesting to observe
although most everything is housed up in tight com-
partments did you know that the eastern star has a
surface covering entirely of cobalt-astralium-steel
cobalt-astralium-steel i asked what kind of
metal is that

  im only an officer of aviation sir not a scientist
was his answer but ill try to explain the metal for
your benefit as near as i can explain cobalt-steel is
an alloy of metals light and strong adaptable to a
high degree of electromagnetism since it has been
proved that einsteins theory of relativity is correct
the new alloy has been developed with the addition of
astralium as the only known insulation against gravity
the metal highly charged with electromagnetism to
a great extent nullifies gravity by that means the
eastern star is capable of rising under practically
negligible power-only enough to overcome inertia
in landing all that is necessary is to diminish gradu-
ally the charge of electromagnetism and she will drift
down to the level of the anchoring towers at the
proper level she is again insulated and on top of the
landing pylons are hidden electromagnets which attracts
the ship to anchor safely and securely

  i was awed at this tremendous advance of aviation

i had spent many hours in the air during my life but
never in a craft of the eastern stars magnitude she

eastern star	

was seemingly the ultimate-all that man could ever
hope for in flying but i presume that like those now
obsolete her type will eventually step aside-as did
sail for steam and steam for electricity like elec-
tricity for gravitational nullification and so on until
man has worn himself back to the dust

to a rescue

i was about to press madden for further details
when a siren alarm sounded in the room instantly
the crew attending to their work in that section of the
ship stood tense waiting for orders madden grasped
me by the arm and hustled me out through the battery
room and up again into the passenger quarters hur-
riedly we made our way through the throngs of
loungers and strollers and quickly entered the control
cabin

we rushed in to find captain markson bending over
a glowing screen his face was twisted in a scowl

  whats up sir madden inquired at once i stood
near the observation exposures and peered ahead the
sky seemed overcast-it had grown thus in the time
we had spent below i looked downward far below
the billowing pacific was hidden the atmosphere
seemed in a turmoil beneath us banks of vapor twisted
and writhed in dark boiling masses a terrific head
wind bucked the streamlined ship and clashed with a
roar against the exhaust pressure at her tail every
sound was audible within the enclosed control room
and the eastern star appeared to be standing perfectly
still in mid-air but i knew that she was penetrating
the troubled skies at an unbelievable velocity i shot
a questioning look at the captain and his first officer
as they stared into the luminous instrument then i
heard captain marksons muffled oath

  we are going to be held up again madden he
said bitterly well have to go to the assistance of a
tramp ship at intersection -- the fool let his
ship run into a high waterspout and seems to be ready
to cash his chips well-well see what we can do about
it take a turn around the ship madden and see
that every man is standing by mr rodman can re-
main here ill take the controls

  as the first officer departed i glanced at the instru-
ment panels for a chance glimpse of our velocity and
altitude the altimeter indicator hovered at 
feet the velocimeter indicated  miles per hour i
stared at it open-mouthed incredulous

  well be alongside of her in ten minutes captain
markson said taking the controls shes a hundred
miles to the south of us well lose another twenty-five
minutes perhaps a half hour if she hasnt cracked
you mean youll have to average six hundred miles
per hour captain  i asked astonished

  he nodded as he touched a pedal on the floor with
his boot toe frozen vapor was now beating with a
loud clatter on the glass the particles of ice snapped
against the exposures with spiteful spats the glass
within was frosting around the edges visibly creeping
toward the panel-centers forming a circle the captain
turned suddenly toward the control operators

  blunt he snapped lift her to sixty-five thou-
sand until we get over this storm gradually now
instantly the eastern stars nose pointed skyward at
a gentle angle after a short while during which i
felt a tremendous weight pressing on me captain mark-
son twisted a small wheel in the center of a large con-
trol and she floated again on an even keel i glanced
at the altimeter in the space of not much more than a
minute we had jumped upward from  to 
	air wonder stories

feet the space below us seethed and writhed like a
monstrous beast in agony captain marksons voice
brought my eyes to him his face was stern and set

  wilson he shot abruptly lift her another five
thousand and well be out of it

  already the frost began to creep away from its
closing circle the cabin was getting warm and stuffy
i breathed deeply and stared ahead i was forced to
shield my eyes however from the terrible glare of the
sun which broke through upon us its rays burned
even through the protecting shield of thick glass cap-
tain markson pulled his visor down over his eyes and
touched the pedal again i felt the ship leap forward
like an arrow shot from a bow the wind even in
this rarefied atmosphere shrieked a high-toned singing
note in friction against the ships snout

  the world seemed enveloped in a swirling mass ever
writhing and twisting far ahead i could see below a
greater upheaval that seemed like a great cone-like
spinning top it seemed to race straight toward us
and captain markson stubbornly nosed the eastern
star down into it the ship bounced and rolled under
the force of the atmospheric disturbance from the
spout while it was still miles away

  suddenly captain markson swung away from the
controls and walked swiftly to the ships television
instruments

  hold her course men he growled head her
right into the storm well find the tramp somewhere
in it

  he pressed a series of buttons on a panel near the
instruments and bellowed into a mouthpiece no an-
swer came he swung the dials around and presently
the shadows on the screen took shape the haggard
face of a man appeared in it and i heard his nervous
tense voice coming through the speaker

  for gods sake cant i get some assistance he
cried eyes gleaming wide nostrils dilated with emo-
tion we cant last another fifteen minutes save
us our position is latitude - north longitude
- west our ship is no  of the iverson freight
line we cant hold together much longer in this
weather our laterals and ailerons are ripping

  captain markson waited long enough to get the
name of the ship then yelled loudly into his instru-
ments

  ahoy no  he shouted do you get me

  the mans features appeared on the screen again

  i hear you he wheezed then his voice was
broken with a fit of coughing where are you
hurry the spout is lifting us beyond our capacity

  ill be right under you in exactly four minutes no
 captain markson roared get your engines run-
ning full speed ahead with the wind ill dive into the
spout and break it youll be able to slide out of it
then stand by to the windward and well look you
over

  thank god the man groaned as his features sput-
tered out of the screen

  give her the gun walton the captain hissed be-
tween his teeth cut the spout in two

            chapter iv
            into the spout

instantly the eastern star shot ahead at a
downward angle and buried her nose in the up-
heaval the storm outside roared ominously and
then as though the ship had dived into the ocean the
observation exposures were drenched with the deluge

tons of water smashed against her nose with such force
that the huge air leviathan groaned and shuddered but
she went on nevertheless for several long torturous
seconds the deluge continued the eastern star
seemed as it were to be driving ahead in the depths
of the ocean then suddenly her nose swung out of
the spout a slightly westering sun gorgeous in a
radiant sky appeared ahead and the ship was free
there were a series of resounding clashes like the
rumble of water on a rocky beach i looked at the
spout again as the eastern star nosed into the sun-
light it seemed to have been cut in twain and was
falling rapidly in tremendous sheets of broken tumbling
water and mist high above where the spout had
raged unchecked floated no  like a huge sausage
she appeared to buckle in her center portions her
stabilizing laterals had been torn away and she pitched
and rolled from side to side drunkenly

  almost immediately the eastern star swung around
and headed for the helpless freighter that no 
was beginning to settle slowly into a gradual plunge
was easy to see despite the fact that her motors still
roared in perfect rhythm she made no headway the
screws appeared to have lost their power to pull but
they managed still to keep her aloft and from rolling
over entirely and plunging plummet-like to the depths
below 

  as she neared the wreck the eastern star slowed
perceptibly captain markson raced toward the ex-
posures and regarded her with disgust

  its a damn shame that men have to navigate junk-
heaps like that he said clicking his teeth there
ought to be a law to prevent such obsolete craft from
taking the air they are a menace

  mindful of the danger of no s possible plunge
captain markson refused to permit his command to
get too close to her i began to wonder how he was
going to rescue the wrecked ships crew but i was
soon to learn for captain markson returned to his
television instruments and turned on the power the
dials were already adjusted to the broadcasting wave-
length of no  and the screen glowed at once with
the haggard features of her skipper captain markson
regarded him for an instant and then spoke roughly
can you manage to get into port no  he asked
i doubt it sir the man wheezed still coughing
shes settling forward now and shes likely to plunge
at any moment can you take on my crew 

  all right captain markson returned scowling
ill do it well spread nets on our hull top and
lay-to right under you in one minute ill take the
chance with my own passengers for humanitys sake
chute your men through the safety tube and ill catch
em in the nets hurry

  the skipped yelled an unintelligible something as
the screen died captain markson grabbed a telephone
and yelled into it

  raise the rescue nets he bellowed and stand
by for further orders

  he hissed an order to the pilots the eastern star
edged into position under the rolling freighter and
halted presently laid-to i glanced upward almost
at once i saw a long string of rapidly falling dots
then the nearest had his plunge checked as a gos-
samer-white balloon of silk opened then another
bulged and another the crew was on its way down-
ward i wondered if they would land safely on the
broad hull of the eastern star there appeared to be
no wind now and they floated lightly straight down
i glanced warmly at captain markson his face was
flight of the eastern star	

tense and he plainly chafed at the delay in getting all
the crew off as he watched every single movement of
the apparently drunken craft above

  presently a bell sounded captain markson picked
up a receiver and held it to his ear

  good he said bring the men down at once
what one man went over the side sorry is
no s skipper with them

  i heard a faint voice coming through the tube it
was muffled

  no the voice said he refuses to leave his ship
shes carrying a valuable cargo and he wont desert it
captain markson swore under his breath

  send the men down he shouted and stand by
on the hull until i talk to the skipper

  he swung to his instruments the screen glowed
revealing the objects in the television room of the wreck
markson pressed a button i heard the signal as it
vibrated furiously in the other ship but no answer
came back and captain markson picked up the tele-
phone again and ordered the rescuers into the ship
the captain was spending precious moments trying to
get a word to the skipper of the lost ship while no 
was pitching madly and threatened to drop down upon
us at any moment i myself was getting extremely
nervous as i watched each sickening plunge of the
ship then suddenly the reproducing units of the tele-
vision instruments crackled i glanced at the screen
the freighters commander had reappeared

  thank you for saving my men sir he was saying
i can not leave-ill face the music better get out
from under at once she wont stay up another
minute

  dont be a fool captain captain markson growled
to hell with that notion drop down now and well
pick you up

  sorry sir the man said a peculiar tone in his
voice i go down with my ship

  captain markson stamped a foot on the floor in a
rage

  im asking you to drop down now skipper he
roared ill give you two seconds to decide if you
refuse then be damned to you

  pick up my cargo the man argued and ill go
with you

  go to hell captain markson swore ive got to
make tokio on time i have the mails and im ninety
minutes late now are you coming down 

  scarcely had captain markson finished his sentence
than no  suddenly shuddered three of her whirl-
ing screws stopped dead she tilted her nose upward
for an instant and made a sickening half-roll over but
captain markson was not to be caught napping in such
a dangerous position he bellowed an order and the
eastern star came to life with a terrific recoil she
shot ahead as no  plunged downward i heard a
series of rapid-fire explosions the wrecked ships hull
seemed to open up suddenly and spew boxes bales and
mechanism a fragment clattered against the steel hull
of the eastern star it sent a ringing echo reverberat-
ing through the ship the eastern star roared ahead
rapidly gaining velocity captain markson stood staring
into the screen i walked to his side the screen re-
vealed the tramps skipper again his face wore a mask
of death his lips drawn tight and bloodless across his
teeth

  did you ask if i was coming down sir he said
with a trace of humor which manifested itself in the
face of inevitable death i admired him for it here
indeed was a brave man-a man who could laugh and

jest with the hand of death grasping at his throat
well captain he continued i dont know how
far ive come but i went down a hell of a way then
he laughed loudly almost hysterically i thought

  you had your chance skipper captain markson
said coldly i stared at him curiously though his
words were cold and gruff his face disclosed both ad-
miration and sorrow for this man who was plunging
to his death but after all i guess youre right
theres no getting away from tradition a mans got
to go with his vessel no matter whether its an airship
or a lumbering water packet god be merciful to
you

   the perishing captain laughed maniacally and waved
a hand as the screen sputtered and died i walked away
with a deep feeling of regret and glanced downward
far below no  plunged like a plummet presently
i beheld a small round patch of white she had struck
the billowing waves of the pacific a moment later i
heard a muffled splash that was all

  poor devil captain markson remarked shaking
his head the eastern star roared westward toward
tokio her first scheduled stop

   far off our port scudded a huge airliner i watched
her with growing interest the insignia barely visible
at the distance told that she was of our own line the
international airway express her driving exhausts
like our own were spouting blue flame the sun
smote her abeam and she glistened like a thing of virgin
gold then she dropped from view into the east

   despite the late hour when we arrived the air over
tokio was crammed with the quaint but speedy air-
craft typical of the orient the eastern star came
to a graceful landing at an anchoring tower chaper-
oned by a half-hundred droning planes their sirens
shrieking a welcome

   tokio was enjoying one of its annual air carnivals
staged until the late hours of the evening craft be-
decked with genuine and painted flowers raced through
the air with rollicking abandon yet they remained at
a safe distance away from the regular air lanes i
watched them fascinated as they cavorted hither and
yon lighted brilliantly from batteries of high-powered
floodlights spread on the ground below ikamono
wrens hirashimoto gulls the more cumbersome cho-
chang metal blimps and many other types of craft
dotted the skies piloted by care-free revelers it was
an open season for american tourists and our pas-
senger list boasted of many middle-western school
teachers bent on seeing pleasure-loving japan

   i too felt an urge to desert the eastern star here at
this delightful time to enjoy the carefree carnival from
a comfortable roof-top apartment in the american
quarter for after all i had three weeks in which
to enjoy my flight around the world

  so it was with delight and anticipation that i or-
dered my luggage chuted to the landing i had en-
countered plenty of excitement crossing the pacific
here was more-of a different sort more inviting to
the heart of a pleasure-seeking bachelor i would
remain in tokio for three days then board once again
a great liner and continue my flight around the world
i sought out captain markson and first officer mad-
den and bade them good-bye they seemed surprised
at my decision to stop over in tokio and expressed
their disappointment at not having me with them for
the remainder of the flight but i assured them that i
would surely be with them on my next vacation tour

   but the remainder of this flight bore little excitement

	air wonder stories

of the rough house broke in a cheery voice as an-
other young man of about mannings age entered a
door on the opposite side of the room

  congratulate me dick old top said manning
joyously im the proud father of a bouncing baby
boy and were going to name him after you how does
richard herrick manning sound eh

  great bob great herrick replied and we will
yet make him as famous as his father

  thus it was that richard herrick manning came
into the world traveling at the rate of two hundred
miles per hour five thousand feet above the atlantic
he had the honor of being the first babe to be bom
crossing the ocean by air at the time a certain news-
paper called him a son of science but little did anyone
realize what a master in the realm of science he was to
become

coming of the phantom

twenty-five years had passed since that night
the first flight of the mercury had become just a
memory a step in the progress of mans successful
efforts to conquer time and distance larger finer and
more highly-perfected ships had long ag shouldered
out the mercury which with the lapse of years had
already passed to the junk-heap

  during the quarter century since that exciting night
richard herrick manning had become a very fine
specimen of young manhood at the age of twelve he
had begun to take a great interest in science this of
course was very pleasing to both his father and his
fathers intimate friend richard herrick after whom
the lad had been named but when young manning
was but fifteen his father and mother met death to-
gether in an air disaster it therefore fell to richard
herrick to be both father and mother to the youthful
orphan

   uncle dick as herrick was called by young man-
ning proved to be a very efficient guardian and under
such tutelage by the time the youth had reached twenty
he was not only an athlete of distinction but without
doubt one of the most promising young scientists in
the united states during the mornings herrick and
his protege were to be seen working industriously in
the laboratory or workshop but after lunch all scien-
tific apparatus would be laid away and the afternoons
spent in hunting fishing flying or strenuous sports

  after manning had reached mans estate and ac-
quired a coveted position as technical advisor for a cer-
tain large aircraft corporation a change came gradually
over the once jolly herrick he became moody and
irritable more of his time was spent in the laboratory
and what was worst of all he and young manning
began to disagree on certain matters of science grad-
ually the gap widened between the two who had been
almost like father and son at last herrick to avert
an open break moved to the west coast some time
later manning received from him a letter saying that
he was engaged in work that would carry him all over
the orient from then on they corresponded in a
desultory way and young manning received occasional
letters from china india java and many other places

  dick manning was just twenty-three when the phan-
tom appeared the newspapers announced with blazing
headlines that the great air-liner mammoth had been
captured and plundered by an unknown craft a long
dispatch followed which told in detail how the huge
airship had been held up by a strange black ship and
robbed of well over a million dollars in gold although

crime in the air was not absolutely unknown never
before had a fast ship like the mammoth been attacked
because the pirate became invisible at a short distance
it was given the name the phantom

  no one on board the mammoth seemed to know
much about the robbery it had happened so quickly
men in black cloaks with black hoods over their heads
and faces had found their way down from the top of
the ship held up the purser forced the strong room
carried out the treasure and bore it aloft just as the
alarm was given the pilot saw a dim shape race away
and vanish into the night

  the papers accepted the incident as the usual part of
the days news until only a few days later another air-
liner was attacked and this time the victims were sent
plunging into the sea then followed a reign of terror
surface ships were blown up cities were bombed and
airships were sent to destruction always at night by a
black airship which afterward faded away almost in-
stantly into the night

  the world was aroused the united states dispatched
ten of the fastest military planes in existence with
orders to bring down the pirate ship at last the
pursuers succeeded in getting on the trail and chasing
the phantom for many miles but its speed was so great
that each time it eluded them the ship would remain
just out of gunshot and when the high-powered motors
of pursuers began to labor under the strain of such
speed the phantom steadily drew away and left them
holding the bag

  some days later the government planes flying over
the arizona desert came upon the phantom lying like
a huge dragon of old upon the sand one of the men
later described it as leing just a long black shell with
a point in front like a dagger and fins at the lack
the aviators dropped bombs which strangely failed to
burst then the planes motors became suddenly para-
lyzed  and those mighty machines seemed to be clawed
from the sky as easily as a kitten claws a ball of yarn
from a chair only two men escaped death and they
seemed almost insane as they told their story

  it isnt natural one screamed like a man de-
mented i tell you the devil himself is behind it all
i can see the thing still lying there on the burning
sand dead and lifeless like a huge black torpedo then
i felt a slight shock pass through my body and the
next thing i knew our motors were dead and we were
heading for the ground

  a slight break occurred in the mans story at this
point and he shivered as with the ague

  as i crawled out from the wreckage of our plane
there the thing was hanging suspended about fifty feet
in the air and making a whistling sound while i
watched it shot away like a bullet with a low hissing
noise and disappeared behind the range

chapter ii
herricks return

while the reign of terror lasted only one man
had the opportunity to view the phantom at close
quarters and lived to tell the tale a certain
young inventor was trying out an electric airplane one
evening about dusk his plane was working but not to
his satisfaction he was contemplating the necessity of
landing before his batteries went dead when out of
the west came a black shape suddenly a bright light
shone on him the thing hovered over his head and he
saw for a moment a long cigar-shaped craft sharply
the phantom of galon

 

pointed at the bow and having huge fins atttached to
its stern at first glance the thing seemed to be made of
steel plates riveted together and painted black at
various points along the sides were crystal-covered
ports through one of which shone the brilliant light

  for a moment the apparition hissing like a python
hovered above the terror-stricken young man then he
felt a slight shock pass through him and the thing was
gone into the night

  one thing only the world had learned by this inci-
dent that the terrible power which the phantom ex-
ercised to paralyze combustion engines had no effect
upon electric motors undoubtedly the shock experi-
enced by the inventor was the same as that which had
been described by the army aviators

  there was much conjecturing as to where this strange
craft came from some said from the arizona desert
some suggested from far-away mongolia and a syndi-
cate writer with a fertile imagination even went so far
as to hint that the phantom hailed from the moon or
mars one paper intimated the possibility that anyones
best friend might be the contriver of the phantom and
as a result old friends became suspicious of each other

  for six long months the reign of terror continued
the governments of the world became desperate and a
kings ransom was offered to the man who should give
information leading to discovery of the phantoms
headquarters scientists worked day and night trying
to find some means to cope with the menace the
brain that directs this diabolical machine said one
prominent physicist has ideas a hundred years ahead
of the times it was all too true a master mind was
being matched against the aviators of the time

  at last after six months of repeated outrages the
reign of terror ended and the phantom was not heard
of for more than a year the world breathed a sigh
and went more cheerfully about its affairs

  while the phantom was following its career of
wanton depredation richard manning had been very
busy working out an idea which his father at the time
of his death had in the process of development al-
though the papers each day announced some new atro-
city committed by that terrible ship manning gave the
phantom little thought and spent most of his time in
the laboratory certain of his friends were wont to
criticize his attitude toward the phantom and ask him
why he did not aid with his science to find a means of
combating the terrible curse which had settled upon the
world he took these sallies good naturedly and usually
would say laughingly that when he had perfected his
new machine the days of the phantom would be
numbered but before the new manning invention
could be perfected the phantom had disappeared

  during the year of quiet which followed the reign
of terror dick manning worked hard and succeeded in
completing his invention it was with a feeling of con-
tentment that he awaited the arrival of richard her-
rick whom he had not seen for over two years but who
was now stopping off on his way to europe to pay his
protege a visit

  it was on the first evening after dinner that herrick
who seemed to be again in high spirits said to man-
ning

  richard my boy what is this new electrostatic
motor of yours that you mentioned in your letters is
it really practical

  you bet it is replied the youth with enthusiasm
why when i finish it the phantom-if he still exists
-may as well give up the ghost

  well chuckled herrick after a time it must be
a whole lot better than some so-called electrostatic
motors which i have seen

  now uncle dick went on young manning ser-
iously i know that the idea of utilizing static elec-
tricity as a means of motive power was long ago
abandoned by most scientists but there was one who did
not lightly cast the idea aside and that was my father
i found among his personal papers soon after you went
west a set of drawings which outlined a scheme for
making the utilization of static electricity really prac-
ticable with these plans as a guide i have at last suc-
ceeded in producing what i call a static supercharger
as well as an electrostatic motor which runs with great
efficiency on the power furnished by the supercharger
young manning then proceeded to outline to her-
rick just how the supercharger and motor worked
there is no reason for boring the reader with a de-
tailed scientific discussion of the machine but perhaps
a few words should be said about its nature

  the atmosphere at all times contains a certain amount
of static electricity sometimes its concentration reaches
a high value and at other times there is very little
lightning for instance is a discharge of static elec-
tricity cither between two clouds or between a cloud
and the earth to understand why static electricity has
never been brought into use the reader must bear in
mind that in terms of electricity volts means elec-
trical pressures and amperes means current-flow in
high-school laboratories there are electrostatic machines
which discharge sparks of four and five thousand volts
these discharges have however practically negligible
amperage and have little energy value they may be
taken through the body without endangering life

  richard manning with his new static machine threw
a new light on the subject briefly his invention con-
sisted of an instrument that drew static in enormous
quantities from the atmosphere by means of coils
chemical rectifiers and other strange devices the charges
of high-voltage static were converted into current of
considerable amperage which operated a specially de-
signed motor of super-efficiency

the girl

even herrick hardened old scientist that he was
showed astonishment when he saw evidence of the
terrific power from the atmosphere made available by
the strange machine during the rest of his stay he
seemed at times to be deep in profound meditation
all of this manning noticed perfunctorily but at the
time he gave it little thought

  at last the day came for herrick to continue his
journey to europe in contrast with his previous mood
he was in excellent humor that morning at breakfast

  say richard he said stirring his coffee why
dont you let your work ride for a while and go with
me to europe the change will do you good and we
will be back in a couple of weeks

  for a moment manning pondered then he said
by george uncle dick thats an idea i believe i
will and so when the air-liner ambassador rose
from her gigantic landing stage in new york herrick
and manning were among those on board

  nine hours exactly was the time required by the new
liners to fly from new york to paris they left new
york usually at six oclock in the evening new york
time and arrived in paris at eight the next morning
paris time the ambassador was one of the largest on
the line and during its two years of service not once
	air wonder stories

had it failed to arrive at its destination on time not
even the worst of storms had marred its splendid
record

  during the early evening richard enjoyed the flight
immensely for some minutes he amused himself by
looking down through the windows of an observation
deck upon the waves of the great atlantic from time
to time surface ships-mere toys they looked from that
height-slid past and soon disappeared into the west
at last when he had tired of looking at the sea he went
into the news room read the latest bulletins and then
retired to his stateroom to dress he had seen but little
of herrick who was now very busy sending radiograms
attending to matters which he had neglected during his
short stay at mannings home

  when twelve oclock came however they had set
their watches at once five hours ahead to paris time
uncle dick joined manning and they went into the
brightly-lighted dining-room it was well filled with
diners in evening attire and above the buzz of conver-
sation could be heard the strains of an orchestra at-
tentive waiters garbed in spotless white glided with
heavily-laden trays to and from the kitchen

  mr richard herrick manning was just in the act
of cutting a particularly juicy piece of filet mignon
smothered in onions when a delicate aroma of violets
assailed his nostrils and the steward swept by with a
stylishly dressed young lady of possibly twenty-two
years in tow he found the girl a seat at a nearby
table facing manning that gentleman forgetting
himself for an instant ceased cutting the steak to stare
after her as she seated herself she gave him a cold
glance and very much embarrassed he fell to eating
industriously when he again plucked up courage
enough to glance furtively in her direction the smile
on her face reassured him that she was not altogether
displeased by his admiration he colored but managed
to smile back as he later said to herrick she is
without doubt the most beautiful girl i have ever seen
uncle dick her eyes her hair her lips are perfect

  rot richard perfect rot herrick had scoffed
who ever heard of a cold-blooded scientist falling in
love at first sight why boy the idea is preposterous 

  richard however was not so sure after dinner
while he was reading in the library a breath of that
soft perfume came to him again and he looked up
just in time to see her disappear through a door into
the salon but glory there on the floor in front of
him lay a bit of lace and chiffon like a shot he was out
of his chair and after the fair one who had let it fall
amid the groups in the salon he picked his way and at
last caught up with his goddess just as she was entering
the ballroom

  pardon me he said holding up the little handker-
chief but did you not drop this

  oh how careless of me she exclaimed in what
richard thought an extraordinarily pleasing voice
thank you ever so much there was an awkward
pause and then the orchestra struck up a lively tune
he spurred his courage-may i have this dance he
asked boldly

  why-she hesitated and capitulated-i guess
so

  the next moment she was in his arms and they were
whirling over the jxilished floor richard herrick who
stood idly watching the dancers had seen them
humph he snorted and strolled back into the salon

  but richard manning did not see him

  at that moment he was incapable of seeing anything

chapter iii
the phantom returns

for one who was unfamiliar with the wiles of
women richard progressed famously he learned
that the youthful beautys name was margaret
huntington and that her journey to paris was in order
to join her father professor r l huntington whom
richard knew well as one of the worlds greatest
physicists

  upon learning her fathers name he immediately
expressed his interest an actual one in the theory which
professor huntington had most recently advanced but
in reality his principal interest at that moment was
centered on the daughter no one however could
blame him for with her auburn hair her cool eyes
and her clear creamy skinfaintly tinged with pink she
was indeed beautiful perhaps though the interest was
not all one-sided for the clear-eyed tanned young
athlete had unknown to himself often made many a
young ladys heart flutter

  although richard never dreamed of it at the mo-
ment it was not altogether strange that the innocent
little bit of lace and chiffon should have managed to
drop directly in front of his chair

  for more than an hour the young couple alternately
danced and chatted upon the cosy after-deck into which
the ballroom opened where couples sat out the inter-
missions it seemed already that they had been life-
long friends but the rapid course of the giant air-iiner
to the east was causing time to redouble its pace the
hour was still late at new york but it was far into
the early morning at paris up there far to the north
in the atlantic day was rushing to meet them in less
than an hour it would dawn the orchestra ceased the
lights in the ballroom were turned down

  oh exclaimed the girl rising hurriedly who
would have thought it is so late

  it seemed as though richard held her hand a trifle
longer than was necessary as he bade her good-night
but if he did she seemed not to mind

  for a time after the lights had been dimmed richard
stood at the observation window looking downwards
and back and listened to the steady drone of the motors

once a brightly-lighted steamer passed below and
flashed a huge searchlight upward but it soon faded
from sight and only a faint glow from its rear lights
was left to soften the pitchy blackness of the sea

at last the captain of the huge air-liner-a jolly
likeable sort of a chap-came out on the rear deck

he greeted richard whom he knew well and the two
chatted about various things

  say remarked the captain suddenly pointing
astern what does that look like to you 

  richard looked and managed to make out a tiny
pin-prick of light which seemed to be moving rapidly in
their direction

  it looks like a shooting-star to me he replied but
it must be some other ship

  hm-m mused the captain yes it looks like a
shooting-star but it moves a little too slow and lasts
too long on the other hand it moves too fast for an
ordinary ship theres not a ship built that can over-
haul the ambassador when she is moving so near her
maximum speed as we are now it might be a scouting
plane but it doesnt appear like one yes that light is
steadily growing brighter it was true as they
watched the light had steadily become larger and more
brilliant	o
the phantom of galon	

  its no ordinary ship said the captain a touch of
grimness edged his tone it must be that damned
flyin dutchman of the air the phantom

  the phantom echoed richard in a whisper and
he felt the hair raise on the nape of his neck

  i must get up forward and take charge of things
exclaimed the captain showing some agitation as he
rushed along the darkened corridors toward the control
cabin like one in a daze richard stumbled after him
and at length came into a small dimly-lighted room
where the captain was already giving orders to several
of his officers

  haltal rang a cold voice with a slight foreign
accent from the radiophone

  full speed ahead  bellowed the captain the huge
motors took on a new tone as the speed was increased
suddenly without warning the fifteen mighty motors
which propelled the ship ceased to roar they seemed to
stutter a moment and then stopped with a wheezing
cough a silence that could almost have been cut with
a knife settled over the huge monster of the air for
the fraction of a second every man in the control room
stood aghast the young wheelsman was the first to
break the silence

  my god i he cried in panic weve gone dead

  keep cool everyone yelled the captain and start
the auxiliaries an instant later the four electric
motors on top of the ship whirred and their descent
was slowly checked

  every man to his post ordered the captain and
be prepared for anything

  can i be of any assistance asked manning step-
ping forward

  the captain then pulled from his pocket a beautiful
automatic electric pistol and pressed it into mannings
hand climb up here to the top of the ship and plug
the first pirate that tries to get down here he said
and turned to continue giving his orders

  a narrow spiral staircase extended from the control
room through a tube to the upper surface of the ship
up this steep helical stairway the gun gleaming in his
hand climbed richard manning passing at regular
intervals the small doors which gave access to the dif-
ferent corridors in the ship as he reached one of
these he heard a stifled scream in the corridor on the
other side waiting to hear no more he yanked open
the tiny door and found himself looking down a long
hall which he might have recognized as the one on
which his own stateroom was located

  he gave that fact no thought for there not five
yards away was margaret huntington the girl of the
lace handkerchief struggling in the gray of a black-
cloaked and hooded figure as the door came open the
sinister invader straightened and looked up for a
moment manning saw two slits cut in the hood and
through them felt that two coals of fire were shining
upon him then the masked man turned and fled down
the hall

  stop yelled manning and raising the automatic
fired the figure dodged into a stateroom as the electric
bullet exploded into flame against the manolcum door
frame the flash died out instantly and the door
slammed heavily

  are you all right margaret manning anxiously
asked as he gently raised the girl from the floor

  yes i guess so she replied weakly but oh dick
im afraid-and she relaxed into his arms as dick
manning felt that beautiful creature huddle closer
against him a strange exuberance swelled in hheart

and he crushed her to him and smothered her with
kisses

  i love you margaret he whispered im crazy
about you

  i love you too dick she replied gently pushing
him away and rearranging her hair

  whats all the rumpus demanded a bald-headed
old gentleman appearing in pajamas i heard a shot
and i open my door to find some fresh whippersnapper
of a boy making love i tell you ill report this to the-

  save your breath broke in manning that shot
you heard was fired at the phantom and he escaped
through that door

exciting events

by this time the whole ship was astir it was there-
fore quite a crowd that followed manning into
the stateroom through whose door the hooded figure
had disappeared it was with some surprise that man-
ning now noted that the room was his own  there on
the side opposite the door a yawning porthole told very
plainly how the phantom had escaped a small ladder
ran past the porthole from a gondola several yards be-
low up to the topmost platform of the ship

  next to mannings stateroom was that of herrick
the two rooms were linked up by a small bathroom
manning stepped to herricks door and jerked it open
herrick rubbing the sleep from his eyes sat up in bed

  what in the devil is the idea of waking a man at
this time of night he grumbled

  its the phantom exclaimed manning

  the what questioned herrick suddenly aroused
to interest

  the conversation was interrupted by a loud crack-
ling noise which seemed to come from above

  good heavens whats that exclaimed herrick
looking toward the porthole manning dashed to it
and looked out but he saw nothing instantly he de-
cided to crawl through that of his own room and climb
up the ladder to the top of the ship in spite of the fact
that the ports on the ambassador were somewhat larger
than those on surface ships it was with considerable
difficulty that richard managed to squeeze through
gee he thought to himself that phantom fellow
must be a sure-enough phantom to crawl through a
hole like this at last however he succeeded and
clung to the tiny ladder with the cool night breeze fan-
ning his brow high above him on the roof of the
liner he could still hear that intermittent crackling
far below him somewhere in that black void lay the
grim atlantic waiting to swallow him up should he
make a misstep a shudder passed through him as he
thought of the sea over a mile below him but he steeled
his courage and started climbing

  for what seemed an age he climbed and gradually
as the top was neared his path curved to the horizontal
at last he came to a position which enabled him to
view the extreme top some distance down the length
of the ship to his left was a beam of light streaming
out through a manhole slightly to the right of the
manhole he could make out a dim black form around
which snapped and popped electrical discharges and
which he judged was not over a twentieth the size of
the ambassador the intermittent electrical discharges
shed a ghastly light over the larger ship and in the
glow he could see two of the whirring propellers that
kept the great air-liner moving aloft not a single
light shone from the phantom as he judged it to be
except for the electrical fireworks
	air wonder stories

  suddenly as it had begun the electrical display ceased
and left only the whine of the auxiliary motors to break
the silence then manning saw a light appear near the
base of the shadowy ship and in its glow he was able
to make out several persons a tiny spark bobbed along
toward the lighted manhole in the top of the am-
bassador then to richards surprise there was a
metallic sound followed by a blood-curdling scream
the sparks flew off into space and the screaming grew
fainter and fainter as the victim followed the tiny light
down down into the unfathomable depths

  for an instant manning frozen with horror clung
to the ladder and wondered how it felt to be struck
by a propeller rotating at high speed and hurled off
into an abyss he was brought to his senses by the
rattle of a machine gun which was cutting a red streak
through the darkness at the edge of the manhole toward
the light that shone from the phantom the officers of
the liner were firing on the pirates manning raised his
gun aimed also toward the light and pressed the
trigger its electrical missiles flashed among the shadowy
figures the new element entering into the conflict
evidently frightened the phantoms crew for the light
went out a loud hissing arose and manning saw the
huge dark shapy shoot away into the night

  for the rest of the night to most of the passengers
of the liner sleep was out of the question there was
one man however who returned to his berth as though
nothing had happened and that was herrick

  uncle dick has nerves of steel his nephew re-
marked i really believe if the ship were on fire he
would grumble about being disturbed

  every one on board was anxious to hear miss
huntingtons story of the attack and how it had hap-
pened the following is the story in her own words
as they appeared in the newspapers the next day

  i retired rather late and tossed for some time in
my berth then i heard a loud hissing noise that
seemed to come from outside the ship i sat up in bed
and was terrified to see a terrible ugly face peering at
me through the porthole i screamed jumped out of
bed and rushed into the hall only to be caught by that
awful figure in black if mr manning hadnt arrived
on the scene i dread to think of what would have
become of me

  of course the whole world was stirred up over the
reappearance of the phantom and the worlds govern-
ments renewed their efforts to run down that terror of
the air but as before all their activities ended in
failure

            chapter iv
            the abduction

during the two weeks manning spent in europe
he saw a great deal of margaret huntington
the girl of the auburn hair he also met and
took a great liking to the blunt grizzled old man who
was her father the magnetic personality of the young
scientist and inventor had its effect in turn upon the
flinty nature of the physicist

  young manning is a person he told a friend
who will get ahead in this world he has some unique
ideas and has enough force in his make-up to push his
schemes to the finish i should be glad to give the dear-
est thing i possess to such a fine young man such
a long discourse from dr huntington was extra-
ordinary to say the least but it showed the high esteem
in which he held richard manning

  when herrick had completed his business in europe
he and manning returned to america and with them
returned margaret huntington and her father her-
rick was disgusted at mannings affair with miss
huntington and did not endeavor in any way to dis-
guise his feelings

  love wasnt made for scientists he grumbled
who ever heard of a scientist that amounted to a
damn after he got married

  how about r l huntington manning gleefully
threw at him

  herrick growled something about feather-brained
youth and allowed the subject to drop for the time

  so richard pursued his wooing unhampered he
proposed and was accepted

  at last the evening of the wedding arrived herrick
had never been fully reconciled to his former wards
infatuation but the night of the wedding found him
on hand

  the guests had all arrived and everything was in
order young manning who should have been the
happiest man in america was plainly nervous while
herrick was in strangely good humor he laughed and
joked with almost everyone present seeming the gayest
of the guests this mood struck manning as being
rather mercurial because just an hour before at
dinner herrick had told him very plainly that he did
not yet approve of the match-why he did not say

  i cant figure out uncle dick these days manning
remarked to dr huntington sometimes he acts like
himself and then at other times he seems to be some
other person

  dont try to understand my boy said huntington
dryly all of us old codgers get that way as we work
up toward our second childhood

  richard laughed and dismissed the matter from his
mind

  the time for the ceremony arrived but the bride
did not descend fifteen minutes dragged by and still
no margaret finally dr huntington started upstairs
to see what was detaining her

  shes probably still primping or weeping or doing
some other fool thing he growled as he strode off

  in a moment he reappeared at the top of the stairs
his face was ashy-

  shes gone he cried frantically and waved a yellow
scrap of paper in his hand

  like a flash manning was up the stairs the condi-
tion of margarets boudoir told plainer than words
what had happened there had been a struggle she
and her servant had evidently been carried bodily from
the room into a balcony that overlooked the garden
the french doors leading to the balcony were open
and a small silk handkerchief lying on the threshold
proclaimed what had happened a flier of some type
had probably furnished the means of escape for the
kidnappers

  a chill passed through mannings heart when he saw
the condition of the room this turned to dismay and
utter dejection as he read what was written on the
piece of paper that huntington handed him it was
a small yellow sheet torn from a pocket notebook and
on it were butthree lines of typewritten words in red

margaret huntington is dead to the world

    the man who pursues dies and he places all
    mankind in jeopardy

                             the phantom 

manning after reading this terrible proclamation
the phantom of galon	

over and over sank into a chair and buried his face
in his hands

  good god exclaimed herrick who had followed
and had taken the message from his trembling hands
the fiend threatens the whole world what are you
going to do richard 

  manning slowly raised his head his face was hag-
gard  he had aged ten years in the last five minutes

  i dont know he replied listlessly i guess my
hands are tied

  dr huntington man of iron that he was sat down
heavily and shook with sobs

  two more weeks dragged by dr huntington had
returned to paris and herrick to the west coast
manning was almost on the verge of insanity at night
in his dreams he would see margaret struggling in a
slimy crocodile-infested river while he stood chained
to the bank utterly unable to help her in any way then
he would see her dragged under by some loathsome
monster and he would wake with her despairing cries
ringing in his ears from this terrible nightmare he
would fall into another in which he would see cities
being consumed by fire and thousands of people being
killed by a terrible monster that breathed forth smoke
and flame

the skyrocket

the reader may think it strange that strong men
like manning and huntington should give up with-
out a struggle but the phantom had so terrorized the
world that its invulnerability was conceded a stupen-
dous reward had been offered for the capture of the
phantoms master thousands had pursued him hope-
lessly and now he threatened to turn and swallow the
world unless left to his dark devices of course
manning doubted that the phantom could really ex-
terminate the human race but he knew that the monster
could play havoc with civilization this was why he
hesitated to seek vengeance

  at last though he could endure his inaction no
longer he made up his mind that the phantom must
be removed once and forever from the face of the
earth but how was he to accomplish this how was
he to make a machine capable of attaining a speed equal
to that of the pirate ship and then to find the lurk-
ing place of the phantom

  he sent for herrick but received word that the latter
had ventured into a remote part of asia to seek some
kind of mineral deposits he next turned for aid to
margarets father dr huntington and was shocked to
learn that the old physicist had suffered a complete lapse
of memory and was undergoing treatment in a paris
sanitorium if manning had read the newspapers in
the meantime he would have known that under the
shock of losing his daughter huntingtons great mind
had been jerked from its moorings and thrown into a
state bordering on chaos

  so of the three great scientists richard manning
was the one upon whose shoulders rested the whole
duty of running the phantom to earth but the great
question that confronted him was how to go about
building the proper ship he knew that with his
electrostatic motor terrific power was available but
to attain a speed of five or six hundred miles an hour
even with unlimited power was no small task of
course his estimate of five hundred miles was just a
guess at the speed of the phantom it might be that
and it might be five thousand at the time he decided
to make his goal six hundred miles an hour almost

twice the speed of the average flier but after a great
deal of figuring the main question still loomed how
could he do it 

  for hours he pondered that question then as he
went out to exercise in the park the solution was re-
vealed to him by a small boy the little fellow had in
his hand a large rubber balloon which he would inflate
to capacity then deflate by releasing his finger from
the end and allowing the air to rush out at one time
when the balloon was full with air the child accidentally
turned it loose manning who was idly watching the
actions of the little fellow saw the balloon shoot high
into the air and fall several yards away

  what a dumbbell i am  he exclaimed aloud not
to have thought of the rocket principle before now

  with this in mind he designed the strange craft in
which he hoped to catch the flying dutchman of the
air the same aircraft corporation that had built the
mercury robert mannings first ship constructed the
skyrocket the masterpiece of richard manning it was
designed on a principle which in the s had shown
great promise but had then been side-tracked and for-
gotten because of the difficulty of obtaining the enor-
mous power required

  under the personal direction of manning the new
plane grew rapidly and with an army of workmen at
his disposal in comparatively short time he had it com-
pleted what a beauty it was to be graceful as a gazelle
yet sturdy as an elephant incorporating a radical change
from the now usual type of combination dirigible and
airplane all excess weight was eliminated and the
body was built very slender resembling more a needle
than a torpedo all the protrudihg edges such as those
of the planes and stabilizers were stream-lined to an
exceedingly high degree through the center or core
of the hull from stem to stern ran a large tube con-
structed of layer after layer of pure manoleum in
this huge tube were located and operated by means of
electrostatic motors the gigantic fans which were to
draw in air at the nose and blow it out at the rear
although this scheme necessitated an enormous expen-
diture of energy manning believed that the centraliza-
tion of power and the double action of the fans would
greatly increase the speed and efficiency of the machine
as shown in the model and later as shown in the ship
itself this proved to be true

  one morning when the new ship was almost finished
manning received a radiogram which again nearly dis-
tracted him it read richard herrick was instantly
killed this morning by an explosion unknown to
manning who had been so busily engaged herrick
had returned from asia while working in his labora-
tory manning learned something that herrick was
mixing had exploded killing him instantly and dis-
figuring his face especially beyond recognition when
manning gazed upon the tom body of the older scien-
tist he could hardly believe that it was indeed that of the
man who had been a second father to him but the
figure of a dragon tattooed upon the right arm above
the elbow excluded all doubt of his identity

  the second tragedy coming so close upon the first
liad nearly the effect of sending richard to join hunt-
ington but somehow his iron will dominated and
after herrick had been laid in his last resting place
the younger scientist continued his work from the point
where it had been interrupted

  when the great plane which he had determined to
name the skyrocket was in the last stage of comple-
tion richard began to gather around him a carefully
	air wonder stories

selected crew to man the craft just by chance he
succeeded in procuring as his chief officer the former
captain of the ambassador who had recently resigned
from the service of the lines with such a man in
charge he believed the chances of success in the hunt
were greatly increased the other ten of the crew were
clean-limbed brave young fellows-each of whom was
an expert pilot and each of whom held a commission
in the air reserves

  the day for testing the new ship arrived it was
rolled from its cradle in the hangar and the motors
tuned up once again as the marvelous structure lay
there glistening in the morning sunlight each vital part
was gone over the static supercharger was tested the
motors were adjusted and the other mechanical parts
were checked

  at last manning gave the word to be off the motors
hummed and like a feather wafted aloft in a breeze
the skyrocket sailed into the sky

  forward ordered richard when an altitude of
two thousand feet had been reached and the ship with
a hiss leaped forward like the device for which it was
named

  almost like one gone stark mad manning put the
skyrocket through a more grueling set of paces than
had ever before been employed in testing a flier of that
size quick turns vertical climbs nose-dives side-slips
all of which would have snapped an ordinary plane in
two had little or no effect upon the sturdy skyrocket
at last manning ordered full speed ahead and the
plane shot forward on a straight course slowly as
the craft gained velocity the speedometer crept up
three hundred miles per hour four hundred five hun-
dred six hundred and so on until it stood almost at
six hundred and fifty

  manning was extremely pleased with the perform-
ance of the skyrocket and began immediately to lay
his plans for catching the phantom as a result three
days later the skyrocket again left its hangar the hunt
was on

chapter v
the hunt

for fully a week the skyrocket combed the wildest
portions of the globe in search of the phantom
but no signs of the strange craft were to be seen
back and forth over the western deserts swept the
graceful skyrocket while sharp eyes scanned the blis-
tering sands below searching-ever searching-for the
smallest clue that might give an inkling as to the where-
abouts of the phantom from alaska to the south sea
islands the hunters scrutinized sea and land but with-
out success

  ail this time life aboard the ship was very pleasant
the huge electrostatic motors worked better than
manning had even hoped day after day they drove
the graceful flier forward without once faltering after
the motors had been sufficiently broken in manning
decided to ascertain the maximum speed of his new
craft when the rate of  miles per hour was
reached the throttle still lacked a few notches of being
wide open

  one day as they were rounding the side of a moun-
tain on the eastern slope of the andes they came face
to face with the phantom although only once before
had that craft been seen in daylight by those who lived
to tell the tale not a single man on board doubted that
the sharp pointed torpedo-shaped flier was the one they

had been seeking on the appearance of the skyrocket
the phantom instead of attacking veered round and
raced away to the south the skyrocket was instantly
in hot pursuit

  half-way round the world the chase lasted time
after time the skyrocket crept up almost within gun-
shot of the black quarry and then the phantom would
put on a burst of speed and draw away for days the
most terrific race in history went on the phantom
was desperate fleeing for its life the skyrocket was
fighting to make the world safe time after time the
men aboard the pursuer felt peculiar electric thrills pass
through their bodies the phantom was using its long-
range weapon the engine-paralyzing ray but it had no
effect upon the electric motors of mannings ship the
men on board the skyrocket were beginning to tire of
the chase when fate in a playful mood stepped in and
allowed the phantom to escape in other words while
the chase was in progress among the east indies a
terrific tropical thunder storm blew up- the super-
charger on the skyrocket became highly overloaded
and although nothing of a serious nature developed
the hunters were forced to abandon the chase for the
time the phantom had apparently dissolved into thin
air

  to say that manning was disappointed is to put it
mildly but with the never-say-die spirit that he pos-
sessed he proceeded to cruise bak and forth over the
thousands of islands that dot that portion of the sea

  two days after the escape of the phantom they were
drifting over an isolated island of considerable size
about two hundred miles south of java when the cap-
tain shouted look and pointed earthward there
in a clearing lay the phantom the chase was over

  manning was for dropping down and attacking the
quarry on the spot but the captain who was still sus-
picious convinced him that it might be a trap and that
possibly the best thing to do was to act as though the
phantom had not been observed land at some con-
venient place and scout back on foot to determine the
lay of the land so they landed and richard much
against the will of the captain went scouting alone

  ill be back in half an hour probably he said
but if i am not back in an hour come after me

  away he went into the jungle and after five minutes
of fighting his way through the underbrush arrived
at the edge of the clearing he lay on his stomach be-
hind a bush and sized up the black ship it lay sil-
houetted against a red sandstone cliff that rose perpen-
dicular directly behind it

  his observations were suddenly cut short by some-
thing landing on his back nearly all the wind was
knocked from him and before he could so much as
raise a finger he found his hands securely tied with a
piece of tough vine and his arm being held in a grip
like a vise his captor proved to be a gigantic malay
the largest man that he had ever laid eyes upon who
stood at least seven feet in height and must have
weighed fully three hundred pounds the giant was
naked to the waist but a pair of dirty duck trousers
covered the lower portion of his body a greasy red-
and-white turban wound round his head completed his
scanty attire

  uga he grunted pointing toward the phantom
and to make his meaning more clear he gave manning
a shove forward which nearly sent the latter sprawling

  half-dragged half-carried manning was taken
aboard the ship of mystery which he had so long
pursued down a dimly-lighted and heavily-carpeted
the phantom of galon	

corridor he was hurried and through a heavy door at
the end he found himself in a softly-lighted luxur-
ious room which served as the office no doubt for that
fiend who ruled the phantom the furnishings the
atmosphere of the place were undoubtedly oriental
the heavy drapes which hung around the room were
chinese and the divan with its many pillows was purely
persian one who had read of the mysteries of harem
life as they are pictured to the western reader might
well have expected to see some scantily-dressed beauties
reclining on the large divan if so great would have
been his disappointment for the only person in the
room was a masked man who half sat half reclined in
a large easy chair behind an exquisitely carved ebony
desk but the thing which struck richard as being most
extraordinary was that the man of mystery seemed to
be a prisoner on his own ship he was fastened firmly
to all appearances by several strands of heavy silk rope
which circled his body and which were doubtless secured
in some manner to the back of the chair richard im-
mediately suspected the hooded individual of being the
same person at whom he had shot on the ambassador
at least the hood and cloak the form were identical
whether or not it was the same man he could not be
sure

  for a moment after manning and his captor entered
the presence of the masked man no word was spoken
but he could feel the fiery eyes behind the mask burning
into him then the master of the phantom spoke in a
not displeasing voice his english betraying an undefin-
able foreign accent

  ah meester manning welcome to galon we have
been expecting thees visit and eet ees endeed a pleasure
to receive such an eemportant person eet ees rare that
we have veeseetors pie paused a moment then grunted
something to the giant malay and manning had the
satisfaction of feeling his bonds being loosed before
he could follow his impulse to do something of a
violent nature however he was propelled backward
by the huge malay and landed sprawling in an easy
chair

  that ees much better meester manning said the
hooded figure now be calm and well talk business

  manning became as docile as a lamb the malay
stepped across the room and stood by the door

  a sweet time i would have passing that gorilla
thought manning i must think fast

back from the dead

 lthough he appeared to be the picture of meek-
f  ness his brain was moving like lightning sud-
denly before the huge malay could realize what was
happening manning was out of his chair like a flash
was across the room and had torn the hood from the
head of the phantoms master when he saw the face
thus revealed he stepped back aghast his face turned
deadly white a gasping cry gurgled in his throat and
the black hood fell from his nerveless fingers the man
who sat in front of him was richard herrick come
back from the dead

  manning sank into a chair and buried his face in his
hands what turmoil raged in his breast to think that
the man who had been his best friend and whom he
long believed to be dead and buried should prove to be
that hated fiend of the phantom silence reigned in
the room even the giant malay who had sprung to
herricks assistance seemed to feel the tenseness of the
situation for he stood gazing at his masters face now
twisted with many emotions on which he was looking

for the first time

     herrick was the first to break the silence  richard
my boy do not judge too hastily he paused the
young man did not move

  will you please forget for a moment that i am the
phantom and listen to me there was no answer
for gods sake richard you must hear me ex-
claimed herrick frantically

  manning raised his head

  i will listen he said slowly and in a voice choked
by emotion but what can you say

  thank god breathed the phantom sighing with
relief in half an hour all will be explained and
herrick will then be ready to join his fathers on the
banks of the styx he leaned back in his chair and
after gazing vacantly into space for a moment he
began

  years ago when you were but a lad your father
and i were working together one day in the workshop
an iron bar which hung suspended above us suddenly
came loose struck me on the head and knocked me
unconscious the blow did not prove very serious
but your father insisted that i see a specialist in order
to be sure that everything was all right i consulted a
noted authority on the brain he took x-rays and told
me that there was a slight dent in my skull that the
bone was pressing slightly on the brain but that it did
not present serious danger

   nothing will come of it he told me provided you
lead an active outdoor life and never allow your brain
to become fatigued but if you fail to carry out these
simple instructions the pressure on your brain as it
fills with blood may cause mental derangement

  so during the years that followed i tried to lead
a normal life and trained you along the same lines
with pride i watched you develop into splendid man-
hood and had nearly forgotten the incident of the iron
bar until a few years ago i began to perceive queer
ideas that filled my mind at times yet quickly passed
away but the ideas returned with renewed force
despite all that i could do a great fear clutched me
and i consulted specialist after specialist all recom-
mended different things but the main thing was to
occupy my mind with happy thoughts but as these
ideas gained force in my mind my own doctor at last
sefit me to a private sanitarium but i hated conditions
there a different spirit a cold-blooded cruel mentality
seemed to have taken possession of me i was becoming
a regular mr hyde

  one night i escaped returned home and then de-
parted for the west you know what happened then
i wandered like a lost soul all through the orient
every day i could feel my other self the demon slowly
consuming the good in me god i wanted to die but
i was afraid

  in my travels i landed upon this island galon
made friends with the natives and started ray devilish
work here i discovered the secret of my paralyzing
ray learned that by means of this ray i could create
a vacuum in the air at a distance or by shortening the
wavelength paralyze a gas engine the ship that i
built works on the simple principle of atmospheric pres-
sure by means of the ray i exhaust the air in front
or above the craft and the air pressure on the opposite
side pushes it into a vacuum the principle is simple
but the atomic ray is too dangerous for human weak-
ness to possess for the safety of mankind no one else
must ever learn that secret

   t

          t was a bright day in early june of the year
 a young man was standing in the
archway of the main passenger entrance
of the grand central air terminal in los
angeles absently fingering a new pilot
captains cap which had been presented to him but ten
minutes before yet where the flush of success might
have been expected in his looks his face was pale and
worn and in his eyes there was the light of tragedy
he was suffering in agony unknown to his fellow
pilots and when one of them came quickly out to
grasp his hand in congratulation tears flooded his eyes
he said hoarsely to his friend only please joe-i
-i cant stand it if you do it
doesnt mean anything now but-but
oblivion

  the captain for whom he had been
pilot-niatc for several months looked
into those dimmed eyes amazed

for gods sake fred you cant
mean that-not with a new commis-
sion as passenger-plane captain why

i dont understand wont you tell
me

  dont make me talk joe if youre
my friend just go in there and tell
the dispatcher that im ready to fly
the cargo plane to guayaquil dont
make any excuses for me-just tell
him i said i wanted to make my first
trip as pilot-captain alone

  youre a queer bird brettner
said joe blaine why dont you
tell him yourself

  brettner was nervously impatient
did id jumble up the whole works

                                   i cant if i
i cant talk-but
ive got to make the trip alone if i took the passenger
plane id go crazy

  blaine made a mumbled remark about the freight
plane being so much harder to handle but he hurried
back into the office prepared to argue for half an hour
in the cause of his friend

  

  ten minutes before this conversation began fred
brettner had stood before the inspectors of air-pilots
and had taken from their hands the papers which
authorized him to assume the responsibility for any

ship on any line of the
great international air-
ways and now that the
great moment had come
it meant nothing more
than an opportunity to
get away from the scene
of what was to him a
tragedy the latter had
come about in a manner
so common to airmen of
his day up from shang-
hai as pilot-mate on a
fifty-place sesqui-
amphibian he had played
the hero to a girl her
name was nadia deneen
and she lived in the city
where fred had lived
and she loved the things
he loved and so through
those long months she

      as time goes on aviation experts as well as
    l statesmen are coming slowly but surely to
    the realization that aircraft will some day change
    the face of this earth with automatically con-
    trolled aircraft explosives of tremendous
    strength that can be hurled from airplanes and
    misguided ambitions of unscrupulous men-
    there is a picture that may well give us cause
    for concern

      it has been demonstrated in the past that a
   few dozen airplanes can lay desolate the largest
   of our cities and if such airplanes are in the
   hands of unscrupulous persons the havoc can
   well be imagined

      it is to be hoped that as in all evolution
    effective counter measures will be found in due
    time that will checkmate the efforts of irre-
    sponsible or too ambitious persons  that such
    a solution may be needed badly the present
     highly exciting story clearly shows

had made his between-cruise hours so infinitely worth
while that he lived exultantly

a sudden departure

she was sweet and clean and clever a brunette with
hazel eyes that smiled out to make his own world
seem to smile back life had then indeed leen sweet
he had once rescued her from beneath the blown-down
door of a hurricane hatch while joe blaine was pilot-
ing the big amphibian through a storm and a hurrying
steward had closed the door without looking out on the
promenade deck for passengers the steward had not
reckoned that there are yet in the world daring spirits
who might stand dreaming in such
a place whether or not the ship was
making dizzy banks and turns through
the terrible currents of air above the
mid-pacific

  after the rescue nadia had never
forgotten she had apparently taken
the advice of a well-known writer
and consented to let him marry her
in recompense for having saved her
life she did succeed in making him
the happiest man in the world even
to agreeing that he should continue
with his career in the air they were
to be married the day he should be-
come a pilot-captain and they had
planned to live near the terminal
where she could meet him each time
he put down after a long hop from
the far places of the earth

  one cannot describe love when
it has come into the heart of a sincere young man its
end is always a tragedy that fred brettner sensitive
as high-strung as a fine racehorse as imaginative as a
poet should have lost nadia deneens love after having
known it was a pity he had nothing else left the
turmoil in his soul was too poignant to- be suppressed
he had gone to her home that morning the day of his
triumph which he was to share with her-and he had
found only the maid who gave him a short note which
he would ever recall as bearing the statement that she
had gone never to return

  she had lived alone with her servant there were
no relatives to whom he could appeal for help in locat-
ing her it was a soul-
stirring mystery that
had struck a vigorous

edsbl itewtoir

young man of twenty-
three and in twenty-four
hours his face had be-
come seamed like that of
a man of fifty there
was absolutely no reason
why nadia should have
ended their beautiful re-
lationship so abruptly
it was not like her and
yet it had happened-it
was real he tried to
shake off his mood as
joe blaine returned with
the verdict from the dis-
patcher who had granted
brettners request to
make the guayaquil
freight hop alone

 
	air wonder stories

  he went back once more that morning to nadias
home hoping against hope that she had returned that
her message to him was all a dream not finding her
there he turned back to the terminal and his ship
gathered his clearance papers and soared away nor
did he see in his preoccupation a strange little man
with a wizened face and eagle eyes who observed him
intently as he made his way to the controls of the great
ship and sent it upward from the field

  and for any curious observer who had followed the
little man the only significance would have lain in the
fact that upon the clearance of each ship that morning
for whatever port in whatever country this man had
returned to the cockpit of a long-range pursuit-plane
nearby on the field and tapped out a message in radio
code

strange events

when fred brettner had taxied down the field
and lifted the big freighter from the ground he
felt somewhat relieved her five motors spurting flame
from the exhausts the singing of the wind through
the braces and the thought of the long trek to guaya-
quil ecuador all helped to stifle the turmoil in his
heart but after five or ten minutes of the journeys
monotony he thought of nadia again how could she
have left him at the moment when all their plans were
to have been consummated  it was mysterious

  the maid had merely found the note and given it to
him she knew nothing more about it and had no know-
ledge of nadias whereabouts

   he lifted the ship higher and gave her full throttle
he tried to quiet his nerves with a cigar but no
nothing would change him now he would have to for-
get life shouldnt be a tragedy to a man just because
the girl he loved had seen fit to part from him the
experience would be all the more worth while when he
had conquered the weakness in himself which caused
him to view it as a tragedy and yet how could he for-
get in an hour he steadied himself and chewed his
cigar nadias face seemed reflected in the cabin win-
dow he slid the glass over to one side and breathed
deeply of the inrushing air he could never forget
but a pilot must go on if he had known a reason for
nadias sudden departure-if anything had happened
to separate them he felt that he had a right to know
it but there had been only the curt note -and please
forget me entirely-i cant explain-nadia and the
motors of the great ship sang a weird song to a heavy
heart

	 

   five minutes after fred brettner had hopped off for
guayaquil joe blaine senior pilot-captain of the inter-
national fleet ordered all passengers aboard and lifted
his big amphibian off for shanghai the usual song in
his heart stilled only by the sudden mystery of his
former mates actions thinking it best to wait till
another time before questioning brettner blaine had
decided to make the best of matters safely on his
course he turned over the controls to his new pilot-mate
and went aft toward the passenger quarters as he
passed the door of the radio room a thought occurred
to him and he went inside to find the operator fran-
tically working over the set upon questioning the
young man blaine learned that the conduits carrying
the wiring from the air-driven generator had been
gutted he poured questions at the operator youre
sure you didnt order the repairers to have them dis-
connected for replacement why didnt you test the

set before we lifted who would disconnect our
wiring

  i dont know said the horrified operator i only
know the jinx has the whole fleet that left the terminal
this morning metzler who took the morning express
to seattle was ill when he took off and he didnt know
what was wrong with him he didnt say anything
about it-

  what has that got to do with our generator leads
interrupted the captain

  nothing answered the operator miserably only
it wont help us it will take considerable time to insu-
late makeshift leads in this emergency what gets me
captain is that anyone should tamper with the leads
weve got to watch out-theres something afoot 

	 

  after the long-flight traffic that cleared from the
terminal that morning-the international airliners that
went out to the cities of the world in an ever-increas-
ing romantic race for trade-a long-range pursuit-
plane left the great airport and swung over to a small
landing field some fifty miles distant its only passenger
was the little eagle-eyed manwith the wizened face who
had been so interested that morning whenever a plane
left the terminal of the international but when he
landed at the other field and taxied over to the only
hanger which was open at that hour it was only to take
on as an unwilling passenger nadia deneen sweet-
heart of fred brettner that she resisted being put
aboard the craft was evident from her muffled screams
and attempts to pull away from her strong-armed
keepers

  id a given her some dope only weve got to have
her awake said one of the men and the wizen-faced
pilot nodded assent as he shoved the throttle full out
and took off at ten thousand feet he leveled off and
steered a course southwest across the pacific

chapter ii
brettner reflects

throughout the morning the great guaya-
quil-bound freighter was sliding onward toward
the tropics freds mood had changed he was
thinking about the world he had left beneath him-new
in ideas but as old as ever and never truly sensible
after all though he was living in  day when marriage
was seemingly no longer the mode he himself was still
old-fashioned and conservative and he had thought
himself fortunate to meet a girl who did not care for
the new freedom demanded by so many of her sex
and now his dreams had been rudely shattered

  love was the greatest problem of life as it had been
with so many others since the beginning of civilization
in these days men were working for the love of work
the ideal of social service had become a reality work
was a matter of serving the community and therefore
common co-operation had facilitated it in every way
in fact the outer aspects of life had been so simplified
that the only great problem remaining was that of love
the world-old problem and there is no such thing as a
logical solution of this

  and now the greatest blow that could come to a man
had hit fred and he was trying to think his way out
he was still in the stage when youth must analyze and
try with all its might to master itself

  he reflected again back in the dark days of strife
in  for instance his grandfather had been one of
those daring souls who piloted planes continuously to
freedom of the skies	

singapore the old man could now remember several
instances when he had left los angeles with a feeling
that he would never return but by sticking close to the
controls he had managed to avert the disasters his in-
tuition foretold and had flown his ship through and
if his grandfather had accomplished that with all the
worry entailed by gasoline engines and the possibility
of dead motors the distractions of navigation and such
details he himself could certainly fly a modern per-
fected plane to guayaquil however heavy his heart

  but he was not long given to such reflections for
two hours after his leaving the terminal a pursuit-plane
drew alongside and nosed up to attract his attention
he looked her over for a moment he wondered why
the plane should be so close then a hand shot out
from the forward cockpit and waved to him he banked
his ship over to get a better view when he did so he
saw nadia her face pale and frantic making terrified
gestures to him  it looked as though she were telling
him to stay on his course and not follow but he
knew he must follow one look at the face of the pilot
whose shifting steely eyes glared in his direction and
fred brettner made his decision

  the pursuit ship climbed steadily and fred followed
sixteen eighteen twenty thousand feet-and still up
into the clouds they sailed he wondered why the pilot
of the little plane should want such altitude but it was
not long before he was to know when the pursuit
plane leveled off its pilot shut off his motor and mo-
tioned for fred to do likewise then the pilot yelled
to him if you want this girl to live youd better
follow me i

  that was all he said he did not give nadia a chance
to talk instead he turned about and headed westward
over the pacific whereupon fred brettner gave his
five motors full throttle and stayed close behind the
other plane

  he searched his mind for possible reasons for this
strange manner of abducting nadia what could this
sinister pilot want of him  he could not pay ransom
for he was not a moneyed man but only one of the
masses why in the name of heaven should anyone
resort to this method to any method of breaking up the
happiness of a young couple who in this advanced day
were clinging to conservatism to the traditions of finer
higher-minded people it had all come so suddenly that
he had not thought of his radio transmitter he reached
for the switch and turned on the air-driven generator
his first thought was an sos message but when
he clamped down on the key it was dead no vacuum
tube glowed he was helpless to tell the world of
nadias plight

captured

after three hours of flight during which time
brettners mind had been considering a hundred
possibilities of what was happening the pursuit ship
throttled down slowly and nosed downwards fred
following her with his heavy cargo plane he looked
below but saw no sign of a landing place in the limit-
less expanse of water however the pilot of the smaller
ship contihued to spiral and lose altitude until she
leveled off for a moment and then silently slid toward
a flat surface that was almost level with the sea he
saw the plane make a perfect landing and then himself
circled for position to do likewise then he realized
that he was approaching what seemed to be a great
floor floating upon the surface of the pacific he slid
the big cargo carrier down upon it and taxied up be-

hind the pursuit ship at the side of which were now
waiting nadia and the pilot when he had cut his
motors and hurried out of the cabin to join them he
was met by two men who it seemed had suddenly ap-
peared from nowhere they took positions on either
side of him each seizing one of his arms in a tight
grasp any discussion must be with the grand
master said the one on his left you are ordered
not to ask questions concerning your presence here
until you are before him said the one on his right

  brettners only concern was for nadia can i see
the girl first he asked

  his escort on the left nodded and turned with him
the pilot of the pursuit-plane had pressed a button
which opened a huge trapdoor into which his craft
was wheeled nadia was left to join fred and the two
men she hurried to him her large eyes filled with tears
the guards permitted their embraces

  fred what can all this mean she asked they
came to my apartment and forced me to write that awful
message to you-it wasnt true 

  well have to make the best of it he whispered
it looks like a big kettleful of devilment to me i
suppose they took you in order to make me follow they
couldnt steal our planes from the hangar-they want
the cargo you see its been hinted about that a cargo
plane is always in danger-especially when it carries
valuable electrical and chemical apparatus as mine
does

  but isnt it dangerous-will they let us live
please dont think of that they wont harm you
or me he said with assurance

  but they wont let us go back home they will be
afraid we will reveal their rendezvous

  fred looked around the island-like structure
apparently they can move it it has the color of the
sea when you look at it from above and it would be
hard to locate

  one of the men stepped between them

  the grand master will receive you below in three
minutes he said almost pleasantly

  they followed the guards down through a hatchway
and into an enormous compartment this thing cost
enough to build to keep a thousand people in luxury
for the rest of their lives commented brettner the
grand master must have fabulous riches

  that need not be true nadia reminded him
there may be a thousand of them in partnership

  i think your deductions will not be borne out said
fred and stopped they were soon following the guards
through a hallway and into a reception room they
looked for an instant down another aisle which ex-
tended for what appeared to be the length of a city
block the ship or whatever it was appeared to have
the deck surface of five of the large battleships of fifty
years before but whatever went on within it was still
a mystery to them

  presently a door was opened before them and before
them stood a tall well-built young man apparently
about twenty-five dressed in a one-piece suit of black
velvet with a sash about his waist his face was ex-
pressionless and its paleness gave it a waxen appear-
ance  but there was a ringing quality in his well-modu-
lated voice it is my duty to warn you to speak the
whole truth in all matters pertaining to yourselves
then only will you be allowed the freedom of the
decks and avoid harm to yourselves

  hes just the man i want to see said fred if
theres anything personal about this i want an oppor-
	air wonder stories

unity to state my side of the case

the grand master

 the orderly turned and walked away without reply
 he went to the door and opened it motioning for
 fred and the girl to follow

   be careful what you say fred cautioned nadia
 i want to know why youre here brettner said
 decisively thats my first question to fire at this
 grand master ill bet hes one of those napoleonic
 eccentrics like certain capitalists of post-war days who
 are said to have possessed such a complex for power
 nalia laughed even her eyes twinkled if you didnt
 have a sense of humor id feel blue she said

   but its true muttered brettner think of it-
 kidnapping you 

   the two young people were ushered into an immense
 room which was lined with blue and golden tapestries
 with elaborate furniture everywhere about a large desk
 in the center there were multi-colored lights spaced
 upon the walls and their reflection gave the place a
 weird atmosphere at the desk sat a young man
 apparently no more than thirty with keen blue eyes
 blonde hair and the form of a greek athlete he was
 dressed as were the guards in a one-piece suit of
 velvet but he wore a silver crest the top of which
 consisted of an eagle with wings spread to the winds

   the orderly silently placed two chairs before the
 desk and motioned them to be seated then he dis-
 appeared through the door and it closed when fred
 and nadia had seated themselves the man at the desk
 spoke in a rich deep voice you are before the
 grand master of the conquerors of the skies he
 began when i say the conquerors of the skies i
 refer to the most powerful organization in the world
 our aim is to control the air suffice to say that we are
 assured of success you are now within our citadel
 which is the largest submarine structure ever built
 it can be submerged in eight minutes our methods of
 action at present are confined to the demoralization of
 the pilots and crews of the international airliners
 the grand master paused and smiled my men have
 disabled the radio instruments on all liners passing
 within five hundred miles of our position this vessel
 is a floating nation-we call it manno marino shall
 conquer the world

   now captain brettner our reason for abducting
 your sweetheart was to ensure the presence here of this
 young lady while we are gaining possession of an added
 number of ships

   the grand master paused brettners face was sud-
  denly a livid white he understood that nadia was to
 be held as hostage for some infamous purpose the
 words of the grand master ate into his soul and he
 must see her suffer for the greed of such a man as the
 one sitting before him  he wanted to fly at the throat
 of the pirate but instead he turned suddenly in his
 chair and hoarsely whispered her name nadia-nadia
 -my god-you  their eyes met two pairs of richly-
 tinted pools with everything that they held worth while
 reflected in them they could not speak only the
 fortitude of the girl whose eyes met his gave brettner
 courage to look again at the grand master the latter
 smiled

    it isnt such a tragedy captain brettner you shall
 not be deprived of the society of this young lady i
 give you my word of honor that miss deneen shall
 remain unharmed with the freedom of the decks as
 long as you obey orders i dont want her i want you

  may i ask why  demanded brettner

  i thought it was obvious smiled the grand master
i shall make it clear however you are to return to
the mainland in a ship piloted by one of our men you
are to tell the officials of your company that you lost the
ship by accident and that you were rescued by this man
meanwhile miss deneeen remains with us as security
for your loyalty to us

  one of my pilots with a light amphibian monoplane
will take you upon your arrival in los angeles you
are to make only the necessary explanations and when
you get command of another plane -a cargo carrier-
you will fly her here

  and if i refuse at his words brettner felt nadia
start before the grand master could reply she spoke
you mustnt give yourself to dishonor for such as
this fred-ill-ill do anything before you shall
you will be wiser not to refuse said the grand
master if you agree and then betray us our detec-
tive force which covers the movements of every one
connected with the international will discover it our
agents are everywhere you must consider why if
this young lady consents you may even be married
aboard-we have a chaplain-and live in luxury with
us indefinitely we can always use you captain your
knowledge of air craft will enable you to bring a great
number of planes to our decks and after we have
accumulated enough additional supplies from cargo
planes we shall put our forces in motion for a conquest
of the world

  why didnt you buy the planes at first and save
yourself the expense of building this great ship asked
brettner intrigued by curiosity

  the grand master still smiled

  we had to have headquarters captain we knew
that in order to maintain an immense number of air-
planes we would need a hiding place the land portion
of the world-that which is comfortable-is now
entirely within the scrutiny of adventurous airmen
i know of no place outside the frigid zones where one
could be so secure as we are here in marino you must
remember we are a nation and as a nation we are
going to conquer the world this meager start of ours
is only to secure airplanes and supplies

  we have ten thousand pilots all belonging to the
order-all ready upon an hours notice to come aboard
as fast as we capture the ships of the international
we have men ready to assume command of them we
have marked out immense stores of explosives in the
different parts of the world which will be picked up
by our planes swarms of them when we are ready

  no we are not cutthroats captain but we are de-
termined we need more than the hundred ships
which we have aboard we want ten thousand-enough
to cover all the cities of the world-and all the high
explosives available we must work fast yet with care
therefore my final word to you is if you wish to see
miss deneen live happily-or live at all-follow my
instructions to the letter

chapter iii
brettner meditates

the two young people gasped the grand master
nodded and pointed to the door go he said
still smiling to himself

  at the last word of the grand master a guard entered
the room and guided the two captives through another
door into the great aisle there they met another mem-
freedom of the skies	

ber of the order who told them to follow him several
hundred feet farther down the man stopped where the
corridor was lined on either side by a number of doors
he opened one of them

  this is the room of the young woman he said
she will enter here and make herself as comfortable
as possible five minutes will be given the captain to
say farewell and then he must accompany pilot and
plane nov to the mainland

  the two young people immediately forgot the pres-
ence of their guard but there was no time for them to
discuss a possible plan of action unashamed they em-
braced and nadia whispered im afraid im costing
you your honor-your life fred

  he kissed her its worth it he said he held her
close and thought hard for a moment no idea of
escape coming to him he thought of her welfare as a
prisoner remember the old formula dear-let us live
in the memory of our love no matter how unpleasant
our path

  she sighed you always thought of things fred
youll- she lowered her voice to a whisper which
only he could hear-youll find a way out of this too 
whereupon the guard took his arm and ordered him
to depart

  brettner in order to leave nadia there in the door-
way of her quarters had needed all his will-power the
whole affair was so contrary to every ideal he had
cherished-freedom love the inheritance of every
american to live without slavery and without force
and now a daring act of piracy had placed him in this
situation 

  he must find some way to combat this grand master
and his wild dreams he wondered curiously why the
grand master should wish to conquer the world why
in fact any one should be so greedy and yet as he
reasoned further the grand master might possess ideals
of his own perhaps the ruler of this floating kingdom
wanted to reign over the entire world so that it might
attain even greater civilization and progress but again
why should he set himself up as the arbiter of the
worlds destiny there was little suffering at least in
america nor was the age-old cry of misery now ring-
ing from the lips of the newer and finer generation of
europeans prosperity throughout the world had been
brought about by a great program of cooperation be-
tween individuals and nations all of whom had realized
that this planet is small and that the happiness of all
means the happiness of each individual

  now in this age of peace and plenty there had arisen
the spectre of this gigantic piracy-

  he was walking along the decks escorted by the
guard when his mind came back to the reality of what
he must face the grand master meant business
many millions of dollars had been expended in this
submarine structure alone how many millions he could
not calculate it was an immense thing occupying an
almost inconceivable space in the water it was so built
that when it came to the surface only the decks were
visible the remainder of the ship was under water
but he saw that it was almost indestructible by attack
from the water it had thousands and thousands of
compartments and watertight doors it contained im-
mense machine shops and dynamos and that newly-
conceived apparatus for the taking of motor fuel from
the different elements power if appearance did not
lie the grand master had power if his assertion were
true that ten thousand pilots belonged to his order
lie had enormous power for no nation on earth had

possessed more than that since war had vanished from
the earth and now in place of international war a
powerful individual was arising to menace the earth

another capture

on his way up to the surface brettner saw hundreds
of men and many women carrying on the multi-
tudinous details of life and all apparently happy in
their surroundings at first he had believed that they
too were fanatics carrying out the wishes of a fanatical
leader but their cheerful industry and efficient manner
of carrying on their life astounded him the guards
who appreciated brettners astonishment seemed to
feel the chasm between them for there was not an
unnecessary word spoken

  presently they arrived at a great opening that led up
to the deck here the sun shone in and here and there
were the great lead-covered cables of the sun-power
converters as brettner learned the suns energy was
being converted into electrical energy which was stored
in great batteries to be used during days of the inevit-
able fog they climbed the stairs-ladder in the lan-
guage of the sea-and emerged upon the huge deck a
large plane was sliding down for a landing and another
of the pursuit-planes preceded it as the large ship
came closer brettner recognized it as a big trans-
pacific passenger liner of the international and as he
made out the ships number he gave a start for this
was joe blaines craft

  when the ship had finally landed and taxied into
position near the hatchway captain blaine emerged
from the gangway under guard and looked about him
with bewilderment written on his face he saw fred
gave a start hurriedly started toward him the guards
intercepted them

  for gods sake said blaine excitedly was this
your game brettner when you asked for a cargo plane
and you are in with that gang of pirates that disguised
themselves as passengers and seized my ship

  the guards motioned their prisoner away

  no joe brettner answered quickly im as
innocent as you are i wanted that cargo plane so i
could be alone but i discovered later that these people
had abducted my sweetheart i followed them and was
taken here

  good heavens gasped blaine he was silent for
a moment soriy old man i was so hasty i the
guards were forcing him down the ladder brettner
waved at him and turned to his guard im ready
now he said simply

  presently a small amphibian plane was wheeled from
the elevator and a pilot came out to tune up the motor
he called captain brettner to enter the cockpit fred
climbed in the plane rose and they were off on a zig-
zag course in the general direction of the california
coast this wavering flight was evidently the ruse
which marinos flyers used to cover their tracks six
hours later they slipped into a small unpretentious air-
port a few miles from the grand central terminal
when the plane had landed and the motor was cut out
the marino pilot said youre to phone and tell your
headquarters that you crashed on the mountains in a
fog and that i rescued you brettner picked up the
instrument and dialing his office spoke to the superin-
tendent repeating the story which had been prepared
for him

  when brettner had finished his companion asked
what do your officials say

  fred tried to make light of the situation
	air wonder stories

  theyre all up in the air he said smiling and if
they knew of the existence of marino thered be a
sudden war i hear that blaine and his ship disappeared
between here and honolulu without a word or even an
sos the officials dont know what to make of it and
theyre naturally disappointed in me for having lost my
ship ill have a hard time sticking to my story
youd better stick to it though snapped the
grand masters henchman it is useless to fight
marino even if you were yellow enough to desert your
girl and tell the truth youd never see her again-and
believe me you yourself wouldnt live longer than
twenty-four hours i

brettner shuddered i suppose you have the best
of me  he said well skipper if were to be friendly
enemies lets get down to brass tacks are your men
going to make life miserable for me by shadowing me
the pilot from marino nodded

  well will there be any objections to my going to
my girld apartment and getting her some of her
clothes 

  none

  brettner thanked him ill go to the office first and
arrange to leave if theyll trust me with another plane
tomorrow morning south to guayaquil on the same
route ill meet you two hours out

  dont bother about the time said his companion
a rather good-natured fellow who had seemed pleased
with brettners nickname of skipper ill follow
you out

  but dont you think headquarters will want to see
you and thank you for having saved the life of their
valuable pilot-captain  brettner said satirically

  yes i brought you here only so that our agent
would know ahead of time about your arrival your
offices are buzzing with excitement by now our man
is one of your employees and will be watching you
when you arrive lets go

  they got into the plane again and after skimming
over the residential section of the city landed at the
grand central terminal as they did so the chief dis-
patcher came out to meet the plane he was by name
gastro-a short fat man with a heavy shock of grey
liair his peculiar appearance had made him an out-
standing character in the minds of the patrons of the
international no one who had ever seen him could
forget his oily face and his great hair and strangely
he was smiling when he shook freds hand in greeting
the loss of those three planes has certainly aroused
the officials he said but im glad youre safe
the acute brettner could not help noting when he
introduced his rescuer that the eyes of the two met in
a manner that told that they were already friends they
exchanged ostentatiously formal greetings and talked
as strangers but as fred brettner looked from one
man to the other and reviewed the events of the day
he was awestruck by the possibilities inherent in castros
association with marino

chapter iv
gastro

gastro accompanied brettner through the throng
of planes and into the field office leaving the
pilot with his plane fred took a seat across
from the dispatcher who had relighted his inevitable
cigar and was regarding him blandly

  the officials are deeply concerned about so many
mishaps captain he began

  fred felt that strange shudder run through his body
we have lost three planes today continued the
dispatcher and you are the only pilot who has been
lucky enough to return it is reported that a number
of privately-owned planes have disappeared suddenly
while on cruises i do not know to what we may
attribute these strange disappearances but weve got
to go on the commerce of the world must not be
delayed by the loss of a few ships he chewed the
ropey cigar for awhile and studied the floor im giving
you another ship captain i suppose id give you any
number of ships before losing faith in you

  brettner gasped it was all working so smoothly oh
i- his voice fell thank you gastro

  the dispatcher rose and walked up and down the
room he had lost his blandness and was now visibly
nervous good heavens captain he said finally we
mustnt lose all our ships weve got to have men who
will exert every effort to save their commands even at
the expense of their own lives you asked for a cargo
plane this morning-were you afraid to take passengers
out on your first trip

  no said brettner i wanted to be alone-i had
some trouble his voice fell my fiancee suddenly
disappeared leaving me only a line or two i suppose
thats my own affair though

  of course said gastro of course-of course
he said it the third time as though the words fascinated
him come around tomorrow and ill give you another
cargo plane-with an important load for buenos aires
you must get it through good night

  good night i said captain brettner in a mechanical
voice on the street again he was suddenly conscious
of being in the hands of so powerful an order with
agents in such unexpected places that he did not know
whom to trust his best friend might have belonged
to it conquerors of the world eh well they had
him nothing short of death could now relieve him of
his responsibilities to them responsibilities which he
must fulfill if he was to save nadia from death or
worse he had the consolation at least that he would
never have stolen a penny for his own gain but to
save the life of nadia what might he not do con-
querors of the world and wrecking the happiness of
youth in order to fulfill a mad dream of course that
would be their method entrap young men into their
order to get them to deliver their stolen planes planes
cost thousands of dollars a big cargo ship such as the
one fred had landed upon the deck of marino had cost
two hundred thousand to say nothing of its costly
freight

  whew he breathed this order has the system
their planes cheaply obtained-stolen ready to rob
government stores of explosives using the suns
energy to give them power gee if i could only induce
the government to raid marino

  but he knew he dared not make a false move he
was certain to be observed and the result would be
the sudden death of nadia no there must be a more
subtle way schemes ran through his mind but none
of them seemed practicable men were watching him
perhaps the very policemen in the streets belonged to
the order an attempt to converse with a policeman
might bring about his death how many people were
in the hands of this fanatical graud master  so many
planes had disappeared that day as to alarm the govern-
ment officials the news bulletins carried shouting
headlines of great losses all over the land sudden dis-
appearances for which there were no clues while pass-
freedom of the skies

ing a newspaper office on his way to nadias apartment
he heard the radio announcement from the governors
office of an additional reward of twenty thousand
dollars for information leading to the discovery of the
missing passenger plane brettner shrugged his
shoulders the world was totally unaware of what it
was facing

  at nadias apartment he procured her key from the
landlord who knew him well in her living room he
stood motionless for a moment the atmosphere brought
back so many memories and struck so much terror to
his heart when he thought of what she might suffer
that he sank into a chair and covered his head with his
hands is life like this one tries his best to live
honorably by the law of his being and a great crushing
force arises to smash his life to bits 

  within his mind was the consciousness of having a
great battle to fight he must not give way to weakness
he must be strong and clever were the battle for him-
self only he might have taken a great chance a long
shot but with nadias life hanging in the balance with
their love restrained their entire futures threatened
with ruin only the subtlest moves could save them
he knew what he meant to her and what she expected
from him he must not disappoint her but this was
not a question of pride-it was a fight for her life
the flyers who had first hopped across the ocean had
only their own lives at stake and could take chances
he could take none he must save nadia and in doing
so he would save the world

  so captain brettner took a small traveling bag and
filled it with nadias belongings after which he hur-
ried back to his hotel ceaselessly his mind reviewed
the possibilities of combatting the forces of marino
no possible way of telling the governor they would
kill nadia and himself even though he succeeded the
slightest move toward giving away the secret might
resuit in his death the only means by which he could
act through his employers would be discovered by
gastro who he was sure was a traitor in the employ
of marino and yet he could prove nothing when
called upon to do so he decided to attempt a few hours
of needed sleep which might help to unravel the tangle
of thoughts which ran through his mind

  just before he reached the entrance of his hotel a
passer-by came close to him as they approached speak-
ing low and quickly remember marino watches you
go to your room you will be watched from the room
adjoining yours the man went on with unchanged
pace leaving brettner on the curb staring backward at
him in amazement

two conspirators meet

the buenos aires freight plane was loaded and
waiting the next morning when captain brettner
walked nonchalantly into the office and saluted gastro
with a forced smile upon his face gastro seemed sur-
prised and when he had handed fred his orders and
the young man had gone out again whistling cheerfully
the dispatcher shook his head and whispered game
boy 

  a stranger who had landed his plane on the field
hurried into the office gastro appeared not to observe
him until four skylarking pilots had passed on through
the gate nearby after which he nodded to the new-
comer there was a whispered conversation between
them

  better keep brettner aboard after this said gastro
hes the only new man youve risked sending ashore-

dangerous business

  the strange pilot nodded slightly true but we
have his sweetheart hes a valuable man the grand
master needs him for the dangerous work

  oh i see he wanted to see if brettner could be
trusted eh

   thats it said the pilot his hands are tied your
tip about placing his young woman in our power was
a good one i have been told while aboard that if he
shows any hesitation hereafter he will get what all
traitors get-the extermination room

   the what gastros face paled as he leaned toward
the stranger the latter looked at him intently

  the extermination room a bare room with vents
in the walls to admit a gas that disintegrates whoever
is inside

   my god i thought the dispatcher

   the pilot continued proudly it was i who suggested
to the grand master that this room be put to use in the
case of all prisoners we cannot use as well as for
traitors we are holding the threat of it over the young
woman to ensure her lover carrying out the great
mission

  gastro shuddered inwardly at this mans words
  yes the great mission he said absently

  the pilot nodded the thing that only the grand
master knows however he is now sorry that he
permitted this young man to lose a plane and thus lose
favor in the eyes of the officials it would have been
better to allow him to gain more of their confidence
and then turn everything over to us it seems that
marinos success lies in the hands of captain brettner
the pilot smiled again

   the grand master is very astute breathed gastro
the pilots eyes narrowed no one dares to think
him unwise he said

   if i had done so i would never have accepted your
proposition said the dispatcher but i want to be
the ruler of one of those south american lands
your wish will be gratified when we have suc-
ceeded said the pilot

	 

   captain brettner lifted his plane above the fog south
of los angeles and set his course indicator for buenos
aires he must fly along it for a few hours to avert
suspicion before turning toward marino his great
problem kept revolving through his mind in the depths
of which he felt there must be a solution he would
cheerfully have given his own life if that would help
but there was nadia what was happening to her now
would they ever be free to love each other again to
go their own way as free men and women do he
writhed inwardly then he straightened and began
coolly to consider matters he was in a most singular
position there was one possibility by which if nothing
interfered he could save the world from marino the
solution to his problem he saw lay in nadias ability to
send a message to metter the greatest chemist of that
day whom he knew metter had finally proved that
he could place in the bulk of a bomb a man could carry
an explosive powerful enough to destroy everything
within a mile the discovery had just been reported
briefly in the radio news bulletin which he had tuned
in while in his room the night before

  two hours out-five hundred miles from los angeles
-there drew alongside the pursuit-plane which had
taken him ashore the evening before the pilot did not
even look his way but turned towards the west and
brettner followed
	air wonder stories

  as brettner moved along behind the other plane his
thought returned to metter and his tremendous inven-
tion then he thought of another resource which might
possibly save the situation the psychological experts
of his day exponents of the development of the human
mind had so nearly reached perfection in their science
that the long scoffed-at feat of mental telepathy had
come to be realized among them if he could only tune
in on one of them and tell his great secret the re-
ceiver of it might be able to awaken the nations to
their danger he would try it not knowing whether or
not he was succeeding in the least he would endeavor
to communicate with one of them in particular-profes-
sor ray whom he had met months before on a
vladivostok-bound air-liner the professor had then
mentioned and had demonstrated some of the funda-
mental principles of mental telepathy which brettner
had absorbed with the greatest interest but he did
not know where the professor might then be

  however he took from his pocket a small ball a
common steel ball which had come from a bearing and
used this tiny convex mirror as a concentration point
thus making use of the principles which had set forth
by the professor he looked into the glistening object
for a moment and focussed his mind upon a mental
picture of professor ray

  the image did not apiear for some five minutes by
which time the plane hit a rough spot in the air and
required his undivided attention fred looked up to see
the pursuit-plane above him he then reverted to a
crudity of several decades before and swore aloud
he was angry his anger served him well for when
he again looked into the ball with fierce determination
in his soul the image of the professor stood out better
than he could have expected he believed that he now
had mental access to professor ray but he kept his
mind off marino he made a mental picture of his
room at the hotel with the professor entering he
mentally told the professor to wait therein for him
three days hence at two in the afternoon when he ex-
pected to arrive perhaps futile perhaps dangerous
he was a drowning man grasping a straw would ray
recognize him and conceive what urgent need might
lie behind this unusual request

  presently brettner straightened his plane again and
looked about him he was flying straight he looked
into the ball again hoping the professor would respond
he closed his mind to everything save the supreme
effort desperately concentrating on professor rays
image and the message finally he relaxed as he found
the mental picture of the professor nodding at him he
relaxed and wiped the sweat from his forehead he
hoped that his conversation with the professor had been
red that it was not a product simply of his fervid
imagination

what nadia revealed

some time later fred brettner looked out to see
the pursuit-plane hovering near nosing down for a
landing he saw the little plane slip several thousand
feet circle and then slide down to the ocean surface
it must be marino it was i he saw the plane taxi up
to the elevator and disappear he circled the great deck
put the great freighter on her ear and slipped for a
landing he came in slowly with the old lindbergh
skill as blaine had called it he had often thought
how skillful the lone eagle must have been to fly
such a contraption as the spirit of st louis across

the atlantic with a low-powered motor of his times
blaine had commented that brettner could have done it
before breakfast with a modern plane

  the guards met him as he descended to the deck not
a word was spoken he was ushered below into a room
where there was a table with food and plates for two
and was instructed to wait for five minutes at the end
of that time nadia came through a door opposite they
embraced it all seemed too good to be true this was
a trap he was certain and he wondered how he could
tell her as he gazed at her her eyes showed a glint of
understanding they talked of trivial things and avoided
the topic which most concerned them there must be
eavesdroppers about he could see that she wanted
to scream in the tension she was under but she was
bearing up like a good soldier nothing weak or petty
in nadia

  i brought your things he said left them in the
plane if they permit you to have them i am sure they
will be delivered safely to you

  was there a letter for me she asked munching
a sandwich

  no darling nor does the landlord seem worried
about your sudden disappearance i suppose he knows
all about it marino is all-powerful i must do all i
can to serve her

  he saw a sudden look of pain come into her eyes
so she didnt understand her look showed that she
now believed that he had deliberately trapped her that
he himself was a member of the order she didnt
know he was lying for her sake but there were prob-
ably cunningly-concealed microphones in the room and
perhaps telephoto instruments which showed every
facial expression his own countenance he felt pain-
fully sure seemed unconcerned she saw it perhaps
as a deceitful face covering the subtle actions of the
man whom she had loved he dared not tell her that
he was not a member not even a sympathizer of the
order yet he could not continue the meal in painful
silence he had to talk

  marino has great possibilities he went on reck-
lessly  it is governed by the greatest mind the world
has ever known i now believe he should be the dictator
of it all he is a conqueror but he does not wish to
destroy he wants only to rule wisely i am his ser-
vant perhaps after all he has accomplished his purpose
-and i am going to exert every effort in his behalf-
he will be kind enough to give me a place of trust and
importance who knows he breathed a sigh and
avoided her lode

  a door opened a guard entered stood silently for a
moment and then motioned for brettner to follow
then terror filled freds soul nadia had risen from
her chair screaming

  take me out there-out there to that horrible room
-for gods sake take me out and let me die he-he
is the greatest traitor in the world-a traitor to his
country and to me i

  it is best that you know fred lied again i can-
do more for you as one of marinos subjects and make
you far happier than otherwise you must understand
he pleaded have faith in me and in marino

  no she shrieked ill die first you didnt tell
me-you took my life in your hands so that you could
have me with you in your association with these pirates

i	hate you with all the bitterness of one who has loved
you and discovered what a criminal you are you used
my love to steal my freedom love i would rather
die than marry you
freedom of the skies

  his eyes followed her as she tottered to a seat a
great pity filled him but he knew he must go on she
was looking at him again and he forced himself to face
her

  i wish they would let me walk into that room and
die she said

  what room he asked suddenly ignoring the
guards tug at his arm

nadia uttered harshly into that room where the
guards drove a hundred prisoners of your order of
the conquerors of the world into that room of
absolute destruction from which no one may return
my god no he said terrified

  your best friend joe blaine went in there last
night she said and then she sighed and slumped
faintingly to the floor

  the guard insistently pushed him through the door
and into the aisle he was blinded in the flood of his
bewildering thoughts his uncertain footsteps faltered
he had stood up under so much that the addition of
this terrible news found him unequal to the situation
he too fainted and merciful unconsciousness brought
peace to his soul

            chapter v
            some regrets

the grand master of the conquerors of the
world had dismissed his advisers and retired into
solitude in his magnificent headquarters he was
for some reason in lower spirits than usual perhaps
he regretted that the laws which he had laid down for
marino had exacted the lives of so many prisoners
perhaps he felt himself in the power of an organization
which he had started and which he ruled and yet one
which he himself could not deter from its course he
may have been reviewing swiftly his youthful idealistic
dream of the conquest he was now engaged in he had
killed many in the initial work of building this great
submarine and equipping it yet he had never wished to
kill anyone-even for power and although he perhaps
had the world already in the palm of his hand he now
felt that he had made a mistake had gone against his
own conscience in decreeing the death of his prisoners
and in this hour he was nervously upset in his agony
and regret he thought of ending his own life but he
restored his firmness in the belief that once having
accomplished his purpose of dominating the world he
might again forget-live down the terrible memory of
the evening before when captain joseph blaine had
marched before a hundred other pilots and mechanics
into that room of extermination and to an unexpected
death he was still trying to clear his mind of the last
compunctions when the door of his office opened and
his first aide came in

  an important message for your excellency he
said

  proceed snapped the grand master

  captain brettner whom you ordered to report on
his arrival has collapsed upon hearing of the death
of his comrades sire

  the grand masters face paled

  who permitted him to know of this a most
damnably demoralizing thing to tell so valuable a man
miss deneen your excellency-at luncheon he
acquainted her with his desire to become a servant of
marino upon which she told him of the disintegration
room and what happened there last night

  the grand master did not lose control of himself



  as a lesser leader might have done he had indulged
in useless regrets perhaps but they must not deter his
action what had happened was now irreparable

  how many planes have we aboard  demanded the
grand master

  three hundred and ninety-eight sire

  the grand master breathed deeply radio to
gastro ashore he will meet our pilot in captain brett-
ners room in the hotel in los angeles be sure to send
a resourceful man for him also have five hundred
of our pilots ready for action upon an hours notice
have their planes here and ashore equipped for destruc-
tion have the grand marshal remind them that if there
exists a traitor among them he will die immediately
upon being discovered deliver these orders yourself
now have a guard bring captain brettner here the
grand masters voice fell abruptly he wished he could
simplify matters but as they stood the world must be
conquered before it could learn of the power which
was being massed against it

  captain brettner was brought in and placed on a
chaise longue before the grand master for he was
still too weak to sit up his audience with the grand
master came as a relief but he was determined to
keep his lips closed and learn all that was possible the
grand master smiled reassuringly upon him

  you have done good work captain you have
placed two valuable cargo ships in our hands without
being suspected their cargoes alone are of great utility
to marino the planes i will use in the work of re-
ducing several important cities along the north and
south pacific coasts how do you feel about all this
especially if i offer you when we have triumphed
the governorship of argentina

  fred was thoughtful for a moment

  a most unusual offer-a governorship yes if i
can be of such service as to merit such an office your
slightest wish is a command my only request is that
you relieve miss deneen of the mental suffering which
came of her belief that i had purposely allied myself
with you and was aware of the plans for her abduction
before it came about tell her what you may other-
wise however i prefer that you should release her
and retain me to help you

  she would tell the world of our plans objected the
grand master no with her matters shall stand
as they are until you have carried out the great mission
which i have planned for you if i permitted her re-
lease i might not trust you fully to carry out this
mission upon your completion of the great task for
which i have chosen you i give you my word of honor
you and the young lady shall be free citizens of marino
but not until then

  what do you wish of me-what is this great task
of which you speak  asked brettner weakly

  the grand master resumed his scat his eyes
sparkled and his forceful voice was impressive i
gather from an informant ashore that you are ac-
quainted with the great scientist metter he said

  slightly agreed fred he was a passenger on
my plane on several trips

new orders

the grand master was apparently pleased with
himself professor ray was right he said
smiling

  professor ray gasped fred

  the grand master nodded one of my worthy
allies a great scientist of the mind he claims to have
	air wonder stories

  tuned in on you today as you flew this way may i ask
why you wanted him to meet you in your room at the
hotel

  brettner could only tell the truth astonished as he
was he knew that if this mental science had been
so developed as to reveal what was upon his mind at
a given hour they were likely to know the rest of his
message

  i wanted to have him help me obtain the release of
miss deneen he admitted

  you are an honest man said the grand master
with cynicism he leaned backward in his chair and
looked toward the ceiling then straightened with deter-
mination go ashore with your pilot-no  this
time return to your room in the hotel the pilot will
there meet gastro whom you perhaps have already
suspected as my agent you are not to return until after
you have obtained from metter a few pounds of those
explosive tablets you are to telephone as soon as
instructions to do so are given you and make an ap-
pointment to meet him you will tell him you require
this explosive to bombard a shoal out in the pacific and
thus create an island where you can have a little place
of your own it sounds like a weird story but it has
been done i am confident that he will let you have
the explosive it is the only one which will serve the
purpose of the great mission the particulars of which
you are to know when you have returned and reported
to me i am going to give you five thousand pieces of
international gold with which to pay metter you may
depart within an hour remember if anything tran-
spires which shows you to be a traitor to us-and to
your sweetheart-it will mean death to both of you

  brettner rose quickly from his lounge feeling much
stronger apparently not in the least concerned by the
last words of the grand master he was inwardly
troubled however for with professor ray following
his mental trail he dared not make a tangible plan it
seemed that his fate was sealed but he then remem-
bered how the professor had told him of the art of
placing his mind out of focus so that none save him-
self could know his thoughts and if he could accom-
plish that then professor ray who had chosen to join
the conquerors of the world might prove his own
undoing

  this grand master is a resourceful character he
thought while he was being helped outside and into
the room where a white-shirted physician was to ex-
amine him and fit him for the great mission

  knowing that not only the fate of nadia and himself
depended on his ability to conquer marino captain
brettner was at a loss to steady himself for the great
ordeal which he must soon face however in the
depths of his mind there lay a message that vaguely
conveyed some hope the thing was not definite but
his intuitions were strong as were the intuitions of all
educated and refined people of his day and he knew
this plan that was still incubating beneath his con-
sciousness would come to success in some manner

  that evening found fred brettner again in his hotel
room where he waited more or less anxiously for the
return of pilot no  the latter had brought him to
the airport near los angeles and escorted him all the
way to his room then left with the assurance that he
would return as soon as gastro had taken possession of
the room next to his own

  when fred opened the door for a peep down the
aisle and saw gastro enter the room next to his own
a sudden inspiration seized him he remembered the

  orders which had been given him-to converse with
no one he imagined this applied to such individuals
as gastro as well as to those not associated with the
order so he suppressed his desire to spring at the
traitors throat and stepped quickly back into his own
room

  he did not close the door tightly though but stood
there waiting for the appearance of the pilot who was
to return and give him the word to telephone metter
he had a conviction that the pilot would first talk with
gastro-and so overhearing any conversation between
them would be of benefit so he was waiting close to
the door when he heard footsteps come past to gastros
room and a soft knock fred heard gastro open the
door and heard it close again he opened his own door
softly to see if the pilot had entered gastros room
concluding that he had fred stepped softly to the door
of the other room and bent down to listen he heard
the pilot ask gastro to get something from the dresser
the latter turned around apparently to obey and in that
moment through the keyhole fred saw the pilot whip
something from his pocket it was a strangely-shaped
weapon-the radium-ray pistol which kills instantly
without loss of blood brettner thought horrified be-
fore he could open the door and spring upon the assassin
the latter had turned the weapon upon gastro there
was a silent bluish flash and the dispatcher wilted to
the floor and lay still then reason left brettner at
the sight of this atrocious act he forgot the danger that
menaced himself nadia and the world he swung open
the door threw himself upon the back of the murderer
and gave his arm a sudden wrench which sent the gun
spinning into the corner the big pilot turned upon him
and showered a rain of blows with his free hand
squarely on freds face but the latter in his fury
drove his own fist into the body and face of the pilot as
fast and hard as he could strike

  round and round they struggled once in the tur-
moil of it all fred felt himself weakening but a pic-
ture of nadia came to him with all the radiance of her
smile and again all the bitterness in her look the last
time he had seen her these conquerors of the world
were ruthless pirates his own pal joe blaine innocent
of all intrigue had been murdered by them he must
overcome this man yet the pilot was crowding him
and working him around in order to get at the pistol
which lay near gastros body brettner realized the
fact and himself struggled for the position which the
pilot had tried to gain and when once he had forced
his opponents back against the wall the grim determina-
tion of the unbeatable fighter filled him he continued
to exchange blows now with a renewed fierceness an
unconquerable soul dominated him yet an unexpected
blow unbalanced him and he found himself on his
hands and knees on the floor the pilot leaped to get the
pistol a prayer ran through freds mind he himself
was willing to die but now in his hands might lie the
fate of the world he hurled himself in a flying leap
toward the knees of his antagonist it was the perfect
tackle not forgotten since his college days and the big
man crushed to the floor his head struck the side of
the bed and he lay still an ugly wound in his temple
the blow had been fatal fred bent down felt of bis
heart it was still

  there was no time to lose he hurriedly closed the
door locked it and returned to his own room quickly
he washed the blood from his hands and face hurriedly
changed his suit and was ready for further action he
opened the door and then looked down the hallway
freedom of the skies	

it seemed fortunately that no one had heard the fight
so he again opened the door of gastros room and
entered the killing of the dispatcher puzzled him and
he wished to discover its meaning searching the mans
clothes he came upon a curious little badge it was that
of the united states secret service so that was it
gastro in the employ of the government had been out-
witted decoyed to this room and put out of the way

  but he could not waste time over that he had a
mission-to telephone for metter in the telephoto-
phone he saw the face of a japanese servant and asked
for the scientist

  he is out of the country sir spoke the servant
i do not expect him back here for a week

  are any of his colleagues here asked fred sud-
denly frightened he was thinking of what would
happen to nadia if he could not promptly return with
the pills of explosive to the grand master

  they have accompanied him answered the servant
can i help you

  yes said fred i am going to ask you to do
something for me

  the face of the japanese was expectant and pleasant
whereupon brettner outlined his needs the face of
the servant was wreathed in a smile he hesitated a
moment brettner smiled and added and theres five
thousand pieces of international gold for you if you
arrive here within thirty minutes

  the servant agreed instantly

  while waiting for the mans arrival fred examined
the weapon making certain that he could operate it
then he put it into the carton in which he had carried
the gold placing the money on the bed when the
japanese arrived fred greeted him with enthusiasm
and an apparently light heart exchanged the money
for the package of tiny white pills which had cost many
lives and might cost so many more and bade the man
adieu with a feeling of relief

  no words of explanation had been necessary only
there had been in the eyes of the jap a strange light of
humor-a thing for which fred could not account until
he looked into the mirror and saw how his face was
swollen perhaps he could offer an excuse to the grand
master he thought so he switched off the lights and
hurried from the hotel he wondered where to go next
what to do perhaps he could find the course by com-
pass but if he could get a plane through the order
the automatic course-indicator would take him there
reentering gastros room he walked over to the pilots
body and ripped from the inside of the mans blouse a
green and white ribbon that was evidently the sign of
the order so he drove out hastily to the tiny field
where the ships of the order had always landed and on
displaying the ribbon was give a choice of planes the
one in which he had arrived was waiting there headed
into the wind so brettner chose that ten seconds later
he was off to marino

  four hours later while dawn was rising in the east
he saw the indicator settle to zero and knew he was
again over the floating nation he nosed down and
searched the ocean about him until finally he discovered
the deck of the great submarine then he leveled off
circling a mile away while he contemplated his next
move

  suddenly he thought again of professor ray he
wondered if the mental expert had discovered what had
happened by means of what he had learned he be-
lieved that he had closed his mind to the professor
but what if he had failed

  the brightening sky had surely revealed his plane
to those below he dared not wait longer he nosed
down and let out the pontoons until the little plane
settled quietly in the water near the edge of the sub-
marine her pontoons held her there until fred cleared
her and found himself on deck he looked about him
but discovered no one guards always waited at the
landing places on deck it would seem that an amphibian
never landed in the water

  apparently too the grand master was ready to
move the great structure upon a minutes notice and
suddenly this seemed to happen in an unexpected way
a great stream of men suddenly emerged through a
hatchway perhaps a quarter of a mile away and stood
waiting then the elevators brought up plane after
plane and into each of these climbed two men the
planes took their positions in line at the further end of
the deck the silence of the motors was weird and
the whirr of the propellers was fantastic to fred he
was frozen in his tracks for a moment until he recalled
all the ordeal through which he had passed and then
he slid down a hatch and hurried toward the room of
the grand master when he arrived and convinced
the orderly at the door that the packages contained
what the grand master had been waiting for he was
ushered into the antechamber where he had to wait for
only a short time he listened to the voices in the grand
masters office when the orderly announced him he
heard the grand master say yes yes-bring him in
fred laughed silently a flash of intuition revealed to
him that the grand master was in immediate need of
sympathy and assurance that the agony of a troubled
conscience for having sent a hundred or more of the
worlds finest citizens to a terrible death was eating
at the vitals of the super-criminal

  captain brettner steeled himself it was the first
time in his life when he felt the desirability of a stimu-
lant  for he was by nature almost totally incapable of
deception but his plans were made and he must follow
them he was surprised at his own resolution when
the orderly escorted him again into the presence of the
grand master a coolness born of desperation had
come over him and he faced the great pirate with his
boyish smile

  the grand master was grave i am glad you have
reported on time he said you have been in a
struggle he added as he surveyed freds features

  fred saluted to execute your orders your ex-
cellency i was forced to defend the explosives which
you ordered gastro had turned traitor and killed
pilot  and in turn i killed gastro with the pilots
radium-ray gun on gastros body i found the badge
of the united states secrct service the bodies are
awaiting discovery at the hotel of course i cannot
return for i will be accused of their murder i trust
i am safe in your protection

  the grand master studied freds face a moment
and then directed a series of searching questions at our
hero whereupon fred related an ingenious tale of
his suspecting gastro and the latters attempt to gain
possession of the explosives the ensuing struggle and
the killings i had your orders to bring them here
and here they are he placed the dangerous packages
on the desk and stood at attention

  the grand master smiled again reassuringly you
have proved yourself he said he pressed a button
and his orderly entered the room then he turned
back to brettner

                 the austere mr maxwell rushed to save the machine and mr treat rushed to save his cat

of these two gentlemen

 orace treat of treat trout andstarting glider clubs in different districts and by his

            treat corporation fiscal agents looked
            up as his secretary entered the private
            office

              that crack-pot inventor is out here
 again and he says that he is not going away until he
 sees you she announced indifferently

   well dammit send him in and lets get the torture
 over with

   the girl started oflut was almost knocked over
 at the door by that crackpot inventor as he dashed in

   glad to see you mr treat im joe flannelcake
 of the sunset aviation club you
 remember me i was one of the fel-
 lows that helped launch that glider
 the day you dedicated our field ive
 come to you to demonstrate the
 greatest plane the aviation industry
 has ever known a revolutionary idea
 in heavier-than-air craft as you
 know it has long been the idea of
 aviators to produce a machine that
 would rise vertically from the ground
 without a running take-off my
 friend i have just such a machine
 a machine that fills a long-felt need
 present planes will become obsolete
 over night everyone will be riding in
 a flannelcake flyer you cant go

 wrong its-

 hey wait a minute take a
 breath will you said mr treat

 listen young fellow i dont in-
 tend to listen to you practice side-show barking over
 some fool notion of yours now what do you want
 make it short

   the self-styled inventor did not seem bothered at
 the rebuke he only smiled blandly and continued
 mr treat you are in business for money i have a
 stunt here that will make you plenty if you want to
 finance it i he a machine that will rise vertically
 that alone ought to interest you

    if it were true it would interest me but if youre
 another helicopter nut i cant be bothered by the
 way did you make this machine yet

   no i havent but

 thats where you come

 in if you will-

   get out of here i
 havent time to listen to
 fairy tales

   but mr treat i
 havent explained yet-
 a button on the desk
 was pressed and a well-
 dressed but mean-looking
 man walked in

   said mr t r e a t
 youre not going to
 either oscar give this
 guy the works

   oscar responded by
 lightly tossing joe flan-
 nelcake into the hallway

   horace treat was pri-
 marily a hard - boiled
 financier but he had
 done much to further
 the causc of aviation by

       interests in aviation societies his position had made
       him the target for a number of get-rich-quick inventors
       who hoped for his financial backing but after this
       last inventor had gone he felt that in spite of the fellows
       book-agent tactics he seemed sincere

    

         two months later a man bearing a model airplane
       sought admittance at the palatial treat home in sea
       cliff terrace the butler announced to mr treat
       the arrival of a mr flannelcake

         throw him out ive seen enough of that flat-
                      head growled horace treat

                            as the butler left the library one
                          of the full-length windows opened
                          and the ever-smiling face of joe
                          flannelcake appeared

                         you aint seen nothing yet mr
                       treat said he ive got my plane
                       here and it works

                        horace treats anger was mixed
                      with curiosity so he said nothing as
                      the inventor entered the room and
                      placed his model plane on the floor
                      it resembled the conventional form
                      of toy plane except that the rear air-
                      foils or elevators were of the same
                      size as the front wings in fact
                      there was no telling which was the
                      front for each end had a propeller
                      mounted on it it seemed as though
                      h mckay	constructed from two toy airships

                            hooked tail to tail

          horace treat looked at it closely

         which way does it go anyway

         up returned joe smiling blandly as ever yes
       sir it goes up

          well lets see it go then snorted the financier

                        first success

      joe started to wind up the model you see mr
      treat this plane is powered by a steel spring of
      the type found in german-made mechanical toys it is
      light and efficient a propeller is connected to each
      end of the spring which causes both propellers to turn
      but in opposite direc-

 ood humorous science stories are a rarity 
 and we feel that the present one will give
 you more than one hearty laugh incidentally
 there is nothing contained in the science of this
 story that will not be evolved in time

   inventors are becoming thicker than pro-
 verbial flies and not a day goes by without
 some of our wealthy or near wealthy men
 being pestered to death by budding inventors
 with new-fangled inventions frequently too
 although the inventions may be crude at the
 time they are brought out and may seem ridicu-
 lous to us they eventually become necessities
 of life

   it is not so many years ago that men like
 lilienthal and the wright brothers were
 laughed at and alexander graham bell who
 invented the telephone was shown the door as
 a crank at any rate the present effort of
 our new author gives us an excellent and laugh-
 provoking picture of a type of present-day
 inventor

 

 tions you will notice a
 small gear on this prop
 this is the rear end of the
 plane this gear has a
 stop fastened to the teeth
 at one point which auto-
 matically stops the rear
 propeller after it has
 turned a certain number
 of times now the idea
 of the thing is that when
 both screws turn the
 plane will not move along
 the ground because they
 pull against each other
 the angle of the wings
 is adjustable and in
 starting the front and
 rear wings are tilted op-
 positely the wind from
 the propellers strikes the
 wing surface and is de-
 flected downwards caus-

ing the plane to rise upward by virtue of newtons
second law of motion or now lemme see maybe it

was the third law-

  mr treat was at last interested or at least curious
but he was also impatient

  to hell with newton lets see the thing go
  yes certainly of course now watch its wound

up and as soon as i set the gear stop-

  somebody sure wound you up too if those pro-
pellers develop as much wind as you do the thing
ought to go to the moon

  all right here goes now the rudder is set so that
it will circle the room after its aloft

  joe flannelcake released a trigger on the device and
stepped back the propeller spun and the craft rocked
slightly to and fro on the rug one end lifted slightly
it rocked a bit more and then the whole machine slowly
lifted in a wobbly fashion to a height of about three
feet from the floor at this point the gear stop took
effect the rear prop ceased turning and the machine
started to circle the room in a curiously lame fashion
the rear end hung slightly downward and the whole
machine wobbled back and forth

  you see commenced joe i will have to put a
model of the jenkins reversible propeller on the rear
end which will reverse after the machine has lifted
this will push and keep the rear end level i shall also
arrange to have the wings level out automatically after
rising so that it will fly faster

  the craft remained in the air about a minute and a
half and then gradually settled downward as the spring
wound down about a foot from the floor the ma-
chine suddenly went into a side-slip and landed in a
corner on top of mr treats maltese tomcat the cat
made several passes at it before joe rescued the plane
but the cat growled ominously it apparently thought
the score hadnt been settled yet

  mr treat arose with a broad smile and extended his
hand

  well my boy it isnt much but it seems to work
ill tell you get the thing fixed up and be around here
next saturday afternoon ill have mr maxwell of
the peninsular air transport company here to give
his ok on it if he likes it we can have a real one
made

  thank you mr treat thank you you havemade
a great decision you will be hailed as the greatest man
aviation has ever known the royalties from this ap-
paratus will make us as rich as croesus itll-

  gin the chatter and get out and dont forget to
be back here saturday

  yes sir i already have a larger model in the making
and ill have it finished up by saturday

an accident

at saturday noon a group of men was assembled
at the treat home for the try-out mr treat mr
maxwell several reporters and a photographer were
there to see the latest in aircraft mr joseph flan-
nelcake proudly displayed a model plane powered by
two miniature gasoline engines manufactured from
cartridge shells it was about four feet in length and
of about the same wing spread

  well mr treat where shall we try it out said
joe

  wed better try it outside its too big for the
house

  not at all mr treat the machine can be con-
trolled perfectly and besides the wind is too strong
to-day

  hmmm well lets take it into the reception room
then but if it breaks anything ill break your neck
the reception room of the treat mansion was of
ballroom dimensions it was high-ceilinged and
adorned with pictures vases and bric-a-brac of artistic
or antique design

  joe placed his machine on the floor and made adjust-
ments on the rudder and on the gears

  we have here gentlemen he began a true model
of what the ideal plane should be it is equipped with
reversing propellers adjustable wings and automatic
stabilizers now gentlemen this machine is fool-
proof  it is so constructed that it is impossible to crack
up in it it cannot go into a tail-spin because it has
no tail it cannot nose-dive because of the adjustable
wings it can side-slip but its perfect balance will cause
it to right itself it has no landing wheels because it
can travel straight up or down and needs none it
can stop start and go backwards while in the air you
wouldnt have an automobile that had no reverse in

it would you then why have an airplane-

  will you please stop that salesmanship and start
that thing going broke in mr treat

  joe started each of the tiny motors by winding a
string around a projecting shaft and pulling on it
they sputtered a bit but soon commenced to idle beau-
tifully emitting a noise like an outboard motor in the
distance

  fine little motors these he said made em out
of forty-five shells a piece of string from the gas
tank to the manifold serves as a carburetor capillary
attraction just like a lamp wick yes sir this little
boat will go straight up just an application of mechan-
ics you know same thing as if you take an auto-
mobile and go up a hill that is fifty feet high the
car will do it nicely but if you should attempt to climb
a pole of the same height you couldnt do it not
because the car hasnt the power but because it is not
harnessed right now if you would put a drum of
small diameter on the rear axle and wrap a cable
around it and tie the cable to the top of the pole the
car could be made to pull its own weight off the ground
similarly with the plane the motor will ultimately get
you to a certain height then why not straight up
the audience was becoming impatient that is except
for a newspaper man who was inspecting one of the
motors oblivious of joes speech said mr maxwell
never mind about all that start the thing off

  joe moved a small lever on the back of the machine
which caused the motors to speed up to a more or less
uneven roar he then removed his hand from the top
of it and stepped back the machine floundered about
for a bit like a moth that has been burnt in a candle
flame and then lifted slightly from the floor it slipped
back and forth like a piece of cardboard in a high wind
and then rose vertically into the air a cloud of pale
blue smoke eddied up with it making it resemble a
pinwheel the exhaust pipes threw a pretty little flame
and the thing was under way

  watch my friends the propeller is about to re-
verse cried joe above the noise

  and sure enough the rear blades whined a moment
and changed their pitch the rear wings also adjusted
themselves to the angle of the front ones instead of
opposite and the machine started at a good rate around
the room it circled once perfectly and the room was
beginning to smoke up quite a bit when mrs treat
entered the room and with a statement about smoking
up her valuable tapestries ordered the butler to open
a window
flannelcakes invention



  the window was opened and when the plane made
its next revolution it was forced downward by the
draft it had been circling just over everybodys heads
but now it came down and just skudded over a
gorgeous chesterfield on the far side of the room up
to this time no one had noticed that the maltese was
reclining on the said chesterfield but as the plane
passed over it the cat made a springing leap for it and
sunk the claws of both forefeet into the fuselage the
craft had considerable momentum it yanked the cat
into the air and then banked sharply upward from the
added weight on the rear like a big bird fighting a
wildcat the austere mr maxwell rushed to save the
machine and mr treat rushed to save his cat and
both arrived just as the cat let go and landed in a mad
scramble on the faces and heads of those two gentle-
men  the infuriated cat clawed deep furrows in mr
maxwells bald pate with its front paws while its
hind legs were gaining good traction in mr treats
mouth and nostrils

the juggernaut

the plane released from its unwelcome passenger
continued upward at its same sharp angle the
first thing encountered in its line of travel was the
expensive glass-prism bedecked chandelier which it
struck vigorously the rear propeller sustained the
weight of the machine while the front one merrily
shot glass pendants all around the room soon the
machine cut its way through and the remainder of the
fixture crashed down to the floor above the groans
of treat and maxwell who were bleeding from many
scratches the voice of joe happy as usual could be
heard he was talking to the photographer who was
setting his camera ana enjoying the scene immensely

  that proves the durability of my ship it is prac-
tically wreck-proof the machine is perfect

  but the machine wasnt as perfect as it might have
been its control wires were severed for it now pur-
sued an erratic course around the room scraping walls
and dousing everything with the oil and gasoline that
were exuding through several gashes in its body the
butler dashed out of the room and mrs treat ran to
the rescue of her bleeding husband she was stopped
half way however by the flying machine which struck
her squarely on the back of the head and the front

prop proceeded to tear out her hair she fought it off
madly and succeeded in throwing the machine back-
ward into the air it veered around boomerang
fashion and then it shot over the photographers
head smearing his face with oil he reeled over back-
wards and went down with the reporters like pins in
a bowling alley accidentally discharging his flashlight
gun with a smart explosion and cloud of smoke this
efficiently set fire to the gasoline that the plane had
sprayed around the room was in a turmoil when the
butler returned with a shotgun and aimed at the plane
which now had one propeller in the goldfish aquarium
tossing water and fish about the place the aquarium
broke open and the plane again took the air just as the
butler let both barrels go he missed the ship but
took most of the tapestries and plaster from one side
of the room joe flannelcake trying to catch his brain-
child was desperately running around the room step-
ping and falling over everybody how long pande-
monium would have reigned is not known if it were
not for a lucky circumstance in the flight of the ship
for no reason at all the plane suddenly started to fly
straight-yes straight for the large bay window at the

  well gentlemen its too bad that things turned out

this way but really it shows what a good machine-

  good machine h- said the battered mr treat

now our line turned like a wheeling nuke high in the dr and waa ruahing back upon the
circle of our enemies and as our long line of mighty cities whirled past them all our
batteries were thundering


cities in the air

by the author of the hidden world

         what has gone before

  war hot been declared bettoeen the american federation of cities in
the air and the combined european and asiatic federations

  it is at a time when all the cities of the earth are suspended in the
air on great metal structures like discs the cities being movable hori-
zontally os reel i as vertically

  captain martin brant commander of one of the air squadrons is
called back to new york to join his fleet they have learned that
from europe and asia are coming two waves of attack on america

  captain brants squadron with a great number of other cruisers is
ordered out over the atlantic to repel the european invasion while on
equal number of american cruisers are ordered out over the pacific
to repel the asiatic invasion

  the americans meeting the european cruisers over the atlantic are
outnumbered although both sides lose a great number of ships in the
bombardment of heat shells the americans by a ruse ombush the
invaders who finally retreat defeated the next day captain brant
is sent with a fleet of cruisers on a raiding expedition to berlin the
capital of the european federation after many adventures the ameri-
cans break through to berlin and make a raid on the city but brant
and his two junior officers macklin and hilliard are captured in their
cell they meet connell another american officer who had been detected
by the europeans as a spy he tells brant that the europeans are
making some improvements in their air cities and intend to move the
cities of their coalition against the americans and finally destroy them
now go oni

strode to the square little window
looked forth from it it was quite open
and unbarred and large enough too to
allow one to pass through it yet as i pro-
jected my head from it and gazed up and
downward in the darkness i saw that there was no need
of bars across it for the little win-
dow was set directly in the sheer
towering side of the mighty power-
towers pinnacle far up above our
level soared that tremendous tapering
tower so far that the tip seemed
among the stars above while far be-
low a thousand feet at least lay the
smooth metal of the great plaza and
though there were other windows be-
low and above us each was separated
a full ten feet or more from the other
and as we knew to merely escape
from our cell into another level of
the great tower would avail us noth-
ing since to gain the plaza outside
we would need to pass through the
towers lower levels thronged always
with armed guards it seemed in-
deed that as connell had said there
was no hope of escape for us the
door being solid thick metal and as i turned back
toward the other three something of connells own
hopelessness had taken root within my heart

  and that hopelessness grew within me in the hours
that followed for when day came and illumined with
brilliant light all the giant air-city that stretched far
around us it seemed only to emphasize the utter help-
lessness of our position

edmohd hamilton

far beneath on the great
plaza lay many cruisers
and could we win to one
of them we might well
make a break at top speed
across the atlantic since
so simple in design and
so unvarying in their ex-
haustless power - supply
are modern air-cruisers
that one man alone at
their bridge-room con-
trols could operate them
yet to win down to those
cruisers down to the
great plazas surface-
that seemed impossible
and so as that day
waned and night swept
over the great floating
mass of the towers of
berlin to be followed by

day again my despair was waxing ever stronger deeper

  for during those days we could see plainly from
our window the great preparations going on still in
the air-city about us already throngs of workers had
cleared away the twisted and fused wreckage that had
been made by the attack of our ships and new masses
of supplies were pouring into berlin
in shipload after shipload from all the
air-cities of the european federation
to replace those we had destroyed in
their great arsenals the air seemed
filled indeed with great freight-car-
riers and official cruisers arriving and
departing and beneath all this great
surface activity and preparation we
knew down in the great tube-propel-
ler compartments of the air-citys
mighty base other and greater prepa-
rations were going on other and dif-
ferent tube-propellers were replacing
the citys tubes and swiftly the time
was approaching when all the city
would be able to rush meteor-like
through the air

  it was that knowledge that made
our despair most deep for though
there was now a lull apparently in
the great wars course the european and asiatic forces
preparing for their final giant blow and the americans
gathering their own forces apprehensively to resist the
next attack we knew that it was but the lull before
the final terrible storm that was to settle the fate of
earths three mighty nations and we knew too that
it was the fate of our own american federation that
v would be sealed in that

    fhe letters that come pouring in with
   l praises of cities in the air are best proof
   to us of the approval of mr hamiltons latest
   story but the best part-the most intensely
   interesting as well as entertaining finale-is pre-
   sented herewith

      let no one think that just because the theme
    of the authors story is so revolutionary it may
    never come about stranger things have hap-
    pened and more so-called impossible inventions
    have occurred during the past few hundred years
    than the basic idea of a city floating in the air
    after all everything is comparative one hun-
    dred years ago a person who had declared that
    it would be possible to transport ten thousand
    men in a single vessel and carry them in a week
    from new york to france would probably
    have been declared insane

      but such is progress and it behooves us to
 be careful when we indict anything natural as
  being impossible

gigantic attack unless
connell could make his
way soon to our land
with his great secret
and that he could not
do so that he could not
even escape from the lit-
tle cell in which we were
prisoned was all so clear
to us tliat almost i wished
that death had come to
me in the cruisers crash
to spare me the torture
of mind that i and all of
us were now undergoing

   it was a torture accen-
tuated i think by the
complete emptiness and
eventlessness of those
hours and days save
for what we could see
from our high window


	air wonder stories

upon the city around us we were as cut off from
the world as though upon the moon twice each
day at dawn and at dusk our door was opened by the
guards that brought our food that food being as in
our own air-cities the paste-like synthetic compounds
of artificial proteins and fats and carbohydrates which
had decades before replaced the old natural foods but
though our door was thus flung open twice each day
there was no hope of escape for us in that fact for
the two guards who brought our food in to us carried
their heat-pistols always in one hand and always night
and day there watched in the corridor outside a full
score of similarly armed guards by whom one could
not hope to pass living toward the cage-lifts it seem-
ed indeed as connell had said that weeks of frenzied
meditation could never disclose any plausible plan of
escape and so i lapsed with him into a state of half-
lassitude that had been induced by our utter despair

  and so days passed not even the prospect of our
own deaths which i knew to be looming before us was
sufficient to rouse me from that lassitude not even the
fact that at the end of that fortnight as i had guessed
the great attack of the air-cities was to be launched
upon the american federation and that it was for
that reason that our captors had given us that time

  connell macklin myself-we three had faced in our
time perils and risks enough but so overwhelming was
the doom that hung over us and over our nation now
that it stunned us held us in stupefied despair but
one of us there was that was not so stunned and that
was hilliard my young second officer his eager
restive nature chafing at our imprisonment and at the
thing that was looming for our land resisted stub-
bornly the deep hopelessness that had settled upon the
rest of us and hour after hour he spent in pacing about
the little cell or in striving to devise some means for
escaping from it and at last upon the fourth day
of our imprisonment there in the tower he turned
suddenly toward us with an eager cry upon his lips

chapter vi
a daring venture

t have it he exclaimed a way that two of
 us can win free with-and maybe all a chance
out of millions with death at the end of it maybe
but a chance to get connell and his secret back j

  but how i questioned how can two of us
even get clear of this cell 

  the guards he exclaimed excitedly the two
guards that bring our food each dawn and dusk-if
we can overpower them-

  its useless hilliard i said even if we did
overpower them we could not pass the score of other
guards in the corridor outside or the scores of others
on its lower floors

  but listen he appealed and then as he went on to
detail to us the plan that he had devised i felt some
slight measure of hope rising within me saw that
dawning hope reflected in the faces of connell and
macklin

  it is a chance he exclaimed and if we can do
it if i can get back to our own land it means a chance
still for the american federation for the european
and asiatic federations wont be starting their at-
tack for another ten days or more their preparations
not finished till then and in that time by bending every
effort toward it our own engineers could put the new
tube-propellers in all our american air-cities could
make those cities able to meet the enemy cities attack

when it comes

  so with that foremost in mind we swiftly decided
that upon that very evening when our guards brought
our food at dusk we would put the plan into operation
would stake everything upon it for even if but two
of us could escape by it if connell could be one of
those two and could get back across the atlantic with
his tremendous secret it meant a fighting-chance for
our federation and with that in mind the rest of us
were willing to take all chances to dare all risks risky
enough the thing would be we knew all depending
upon what occurred in one moment of rushing action
and numberless were the features of it that might go
entirely wrong and ruin us but we steeled ourselves
with the thought of what would become of our feder-
ation if we failed and so ready and tense with re-
solution we waited for the coming of dusk

  to me through the remaining hours of that day it
seemed that never had the sun sunk westward so slow-
ly from our window we could see all the activities
that went on in the great air-city about us could see
far across all this great mass of towers and streets
and thronging crowds which hung here miles in the air
above the earth and could see those activities lessen-
ing somewhat as the long shadows of sunset fell across
narrow streets and smooth plazas in the great plaza
beneath at the foot of that electrostatic tower in which
we were imprisoned there rested always a number of
great cruisers of the european fleet reporting to the
first air chief there in the towers base and now
with the approach of night other cruisers from the
swarming masses above the city were slanting down to
rest upon the plaza and these cruisers we watched
with intent gaze as the sunsets light declined

  outside in the corridor we could hear the oc-
casional movement of feet as the score of guards there
moved about now and then but heard not the ap-
proaching feet of the two that brought our food what
if they were not to come upon this evening or what
if more than two or less than two were to come
either contingency would be equally ruinous to our
plan and with the passing of each moment we sat in
an increasing agony of expectation connells eyes
burning macklin as imperturbable as ever hilliard
eager and tense then at last when the shadows of
dusk were falling across the great city of the air out-
side were deepening in our little cell we heard voices
outside the greetings of our guards in the corridor
and then a moment later the solid metal door of our
cell had clicked open then into the cell stepped our
two usual guards with our food their heat-pistols ready
as always in their right hands

   the eyes of one warily upon us the other took both
of the metal containers of synthetic food and reached
to place them as usual upon the lower bunk-rack
at the rooms right hand side macklin was lying upon
that bunk-rack having stretched himself out as though
sleeping the rest of us were lounging at the cells
other side the second guards heat-pistol watchfully
upon us while the first reached toward the bunk-rack to
place the metal food-containers beside the supposedly-
sleeping macklins head but as lie placed them there
as he began to turn away from it macklins hands shot
suddenly behind his head as he lay there and grasped
the arm of the first guard in a single movement jerking
him toward the bunk-rack like lightning the second
guard turned with his pistol toward that sudden move-
ment and as he did so forgetful for the instant of the
rest of us we three had leaped upon him and then
as hilliard and i bore the second guard to the floor
cities in the air



wrenching the pistol from him macklin and connell had
jammed the first one against the cells corner with hand
upon his mouth and had him equally powerless

  the whole swift scene of action had taken but a
flashing moment to carry out and so lightning-like
had been our movements so careful above all had we
been to gag with our hands the two guards as we
grasped them that no single sound save for a few low-
choking gasps had come from them and then while
with hands over their mouths and with all the
strength of our muscles hilliard and i held the two
guards macklin and connell were swiftly stripping
their tight-jacketed green uniforms from them

  a moment more and connell and macklin were
swiftly doffing their own black uniforms of the amer-
ican federation and donning the green ones now
came a restless movement of feet in the corridor with-
out and with the speed of utter necessity we took the
two discarded black uniforms and forced them upon
the two guards holding them still voiceless and power-
less then that done the two guards were as like
in their black uniforms as hilliard and myself with
connell and macklin the latter having been chosen
because of the similarity of his appearance to one of
the guards wearing now the guards green uniforms
and now the very climax of our endeavor was come
that moment upon which depended all for now sud-
denly removing our hands from the lips of the two
guards we held we added our own sudden cries to
theirs and at the same moment connell and macklin
in their green uniforms were engaging in a mock
struggle with us and with our guards whose din seem-
ed terrific there in the quiet upper levels of the great
tower

  instantly as those cries arose there was a rush of
feet outside and the score of guards there poured down
the corridor and through the cells door to see four
of us in black uniforms struggling apparently with
two green-uniformed guards who were in reality con-
nell and macklin it was the moment upon which all
rested and in that moment the score of guards acted
as- hilliard had foreseen gazing not in that wild mo-
ment of frenzied action at faces but at uniforms see-
ing only in that first moment in the dusky cell four
black-garbed men struggling with two green-garbed
ones they had seen enter it but moments before and
seeing this they rushed upon us four black-uniformed
ones hilliard and myself and the guards whom in
the guise of aiding in the struggle we had held and
began to beat us back against the cells end totally
forgetting in that moment the two green-uniformed
men they were succoring and in that moment as
they pressed us back connell and macklin were steal-
ing swiftly out of the cell and down the corridor
toward the hall of the cage-lifts

  for but a moment more did we struggle with our
outnumbering opponents there and then as they
gripped and held the four of us helpless and jerked
our heads up wild cries came from them as they saw
the faces of us saw that two of us were their own
guards then the next moment needing no other ex-
planation of what had happened they turned with
their own black-garbed fellows rushed out of the cell
slamming shut its door behind them down the cor-
ridor and toward the cage-lifts after connell and mac-
klin we heard those cries re-echoed swiftly over all
the mighty building heard rushing feet and repeated
calls on the levels of the great tower above and be-
neath us and then as we flung ourselves to our

window gazed downward we saw in the next mo-
ment two green-garbed tiny figures issuing from the
giant electrostatic towers base far beneath us run-
ning across the great plaza toward the nearest of the
cruisers they were connell and macklin

  i cried out with hilliard hoarse words of encourage-
ment forgetful that none could hear from our ter-
rific height saw connell and macklin rushing up the
slender gangplank in the cruisers side and through its
open door saw that door dam shut behind them just as
from the base of the tower there poured out after
them a flood of pursuing green-garbed figures those
pursuers were raising their heat-pistols and a hail of
shining heat-cartridges were flying through the air
toward the cruiser in the next moment but as they
shot toward it there came faintly up to us the dron-
ing of the ships great motors and then with all the
power of those motors in its vertical lifting tube-prop-
ellers it was rising upward was lifting smoothly and
swiftly upward toward us and at the same moment
the green-uniformed crowd of guards beneath were
rushing across the plaza toward the other resting
cruisers were rushing within them to soar up after
connell and macklin

  up toward us shot the lifting cruiser of our two
friends though up toward our little window for such
had been our plan by which two escaping might
rescue the remaining two but as it shot upward i
looked down saw beneath the scores of cruisers on
the plaza rising now after it heard through all the
great tower and for far around it a great roar of
rising shouts as the escape was discovered saw the
giant gleaming muzzles of the great batteries of heat-
guns around the plaza turning swiftly upward on their
pivots toward the rising cruiser of connell and mac-
klin and so the next moment as that cruiser shot
up toward us as i made out macklin plain in its
transparent-windowed bridge-room driving it up to-
ward us i flung an arm outward from the tower to
him shouting in frenzied appeal

  back macklin i cried with hilliard crying too
beside me no time to get us-back home with con-
nell for gods sake

  he saw my frenzied gesture westward caught the
meaning of my wild warning shout as the guns be-
neath swung toward him and the cruisers below rushed
up and i saw him hang there for a fraction of a
moment irresolute hesitating then the next moment
just as there came a swift-spreading thunder of deton-
ations from the great heat-guns around the plaza he
had whirled the wheel over and sent the great cruiser
rushing away from the tower sent it rushing westward
through the dusk above the great air-citys gathered
lights in the next instant there shot through the
air where it had been the shining heat-shells from be-
neath and then as macklins cruiser rushed comet-
like onward through the dusk the great heat-guns be-
neath were turning again toward it

  i cried out hoarsely as they thundered again but
with a whirl sidewise macklin and connell had
evaded the rushing shells and were hurtling on now
over all the great air-city over all the mighty mass of
berlin was spreading a roar of alarm and now the
cruisers that had rushed up in pursuit were rocketing
westward after that single fleeing one the batteries be-
neath us holding their fire lest they strike their own
pursuing ships with our hearts pounding hilliard
and i saw that single little cruiser leap on saw it shoot-
ing through the dusk until its gleaming shape was now
far away from the great air-city racing westward
	air wonder stories

swiftly though the numberless pursuing cruisers were
converging upon it and then as we strained our eyes
to see the flying gleaming craft there came a greater
thundering of guns as all the suddenly-alarmed bat-
teries at the air-citys westward edge loosed their shells
upon the fleeing cruiser that cruiser seemed to halt
for a moment unaccountably there was a great blind-
ing flare that could be made only by heat-shells strik-
ing and then the cruiser the cruiser that held macklin
and connell and all the american federations fate
was reeling blindly downward and out of sight whirl-
ing lifelessly downward toward the earth far below

chapter vii
the great movement start

stunned and stupefied hilliard and i gazed
out in that moment from our wmdow out through
the dusk above the air-city to where the cruiser
of our two friends had plunged to death i think
now that for those first few moments neither of us
was able completely to comprehend what had happened
to comprehend what malign fate it was that had sent
our friends down to death there as they seemed making
their escape staring forth blankly we saw the
cruisers that had been pursuing them that had been
overtaking them turning back now toward the air-city
heard a cheer rolling across that city as the crowds in
its streets witnessed the destruction of the fleeing
craft the flare of the shells that had destroyed it
that great roaring cheer from beneath penetrated at
last into my brain with realization of what had hap-
pened

  macklin-connell- i whispered macklin and
connell-gone-and the last chance to warn our fed-
eration gone-

  hilliards eyes were bright with unshed tears our
last chance he said

  looking back i think now that it was not the passing
of our one chance for freedom nor the passing even
of our one chance to carry connells great secret home-
ward that weighed upon us most in the following time
it was the swift passing of our two friends of macklin
especially who for long had formed with hilliard and
myself the trio that commanded my cruiser that stab-
bed us most in those first following hours and days
prisoned there as before but two of us now where
there had been four we waited now in a certain heed-
lessness for the doom that we knew awaited us and our
federation the wild break for freedom that two
of us had made and that had ended in those twos
dest uction had apparently not changed the plans of
the european first air chief in regard to us and we
knew that at the end of the designated fortnight less
than ten days hence now we must either reveal all our
knowledge of the american forces which we could
not do or suffer death

  we knw too that even as connell had guessed
it was at tnfe end of that fortnight ten days hence
that the european and asiatic federations planned to
launch their final gigantic attack of air-cities since it
was evident that they wished to gain their information
from us only to use it immediately in their attack
for now below in the citys base-compartments the
great new tube-propellers that were to whirl it through
the air at such terrific speed were being completed we
knew as in all the two hundred air-cities of the euro-
pean and asiatic federations the long months of
experimentation over it needed but weeks or days to
rush those new tube-propellers into place and had

connell escaped with his secret it might well have been
i thought that even in the ten days left the new-type
tubes could have been swiftly manufactured by thou-
sands and placed in all our own american air-cities

  if connell had escaped but connell had not es-
caped connell had plunged to death with macklin
amid the flaring heat-shells prisoned there in our
little cell hilliard and i despite that ever-approaching
doom almost paid no attention whatever to all out-
side and about us brooding there in silence hour upon
hour as night followed day and day night we had
not even the slightest further thoughts of escape
altho such thoughts would have been hopeless for now
our door was never opened save by the full score of
armed guards outside so losing all thought and all
hope of freedom we sat on in our little prison high
in the mighty tower dead to all the unceasing rush of
preparations and gathering of cruisers in the city about
us

  but at last upon the eighth day after the break of
connell and macklin and the second day before our
approaching doom there came an event which roused
us suddenly from that renewed apathy into which we
had fallen for days we had noticed that the crowds
in the streets were proving fewer and fewer the only
people now remaining being groups of green-uni form-
ed officials unceasingly moving in and out of the head-
quarters there there was finally made clear to us
the reason of their activities for as we gazed forth
from our window on the afternoon of that day we
seemed to sense a certain air of anticipation in the
people that remained they swarmed forth into the
great air-citys streets we heard in a moment more a
strange great hissing from far below us all around the
citys base and edge and then were aware that with
that hissing sound and with a great tremor of power
that beat through all its colossal metal mass the great
air-city was moving was moving not slowly and
majestically as air-cities commonly move but was
leaping forward through the air with sudden tremen-
dous speed we knew now that most of the citys
population had been removed to the ground and the
movement toward the west had started

  now came excited roars from the crowds beneath
as the giant mass that was berlin leapt forward and
now as hilliard and i leaned from our window with
an excitement almost as great we caught our breaths
for we could see now from the cloud-masses that
lay beneath in the distance that the great air-city was
cleaving the air at a speed that was rapidly mounting
to over a hundred miles an hour terrific winds were
whirling all about our power-tower as it shot through
the atmosphere and those same winds sweeping with
titanic force through the citys streets and about its
towers forced the crowds in those streets swiftly within
the shelter of the structures and still at ever-mount-
ing speed the hissing of power and the tremendous
roar of winds increasing still the mighty air-city was
whirling on its soaring towers of metal swaying back
beneath the awful winds of their progress whipping
through high cloud-banks and out into clear air again
giving us flashing glimpses from our own wind-swept
window of the ground far outward and beneath flash-
ing back at immense speed as we shot onward as all
the colossal city sped on at a velocity that i knew by
then must be over a hundred and fifty miles an hour

  a colossal city speeding through earths atmosphere
awed despite ourselves hilliard and i clung at our
window there as with all else in the city we sped on
a colossal city five full miles in its diameter with all
cities in the air	

its works and streets and giant batteries of heat-guns
and rushing above earth at a velocity seeming almost
unattainable and even as we watched we felt the
great city slanting upward with the same terrific speed
climbing swiftly upward until the air about us was all
but freezing and then diving down toward earth once
more on a long gliding swoop then it had turned
in mid-air was flashing back over its course was go-
ing through maneuver after maneuver until at last the
great hissing from its base ceased and it hung at its
former height above the earth once more the crowds
in its towers surging forth now to renew their excited
shouts

last preparations

hilliard and i gazed for a long moment at each
other the tube-propellers they were putting in
-finished- he said slowly and berlin ready now
for the great attack-

  and all the other european federation cities i
said and all those of the asiatic federation-all must
be nearly completed now their new tube-propellers
installed also and in two more days-

   in two more days it was the thought that beat ham-
mer-like in my brain and in hilliards in those hours
that followed those hours that were now closing down
one by one upon the doom of ourselves and of all
our nation two more days two more days at the
end of which would have ended the fortnight of our
imprisonment when would come for us the death that
had loomed larger and larger during each of those pass-
ing days two more days at the end of which the
great air-cities of the european and asiatic federations
would rush like whirlwinds over the oceans toward our
own slow-moving and helpless cities to beat them down
with all the thunder of their giant batteries two more
days- and at the end of them for us and for all
the great air-cities and all the millions of the american
federation doom

   it is not to be wondered at therefore that in the
following hours hilliard and i felt close about us the
intense despair that ever since the ill-fated attempt of
connell and macklin had surrounded us through all
that night following the first demonstration of the im-
mense speed of the air-city we sat awake listening to
the great shouts of triumph and exultation that came
dimly up to us from the crowds that remained in the
streets far beneath the european federation we
knew already felt the glow of imminent victory that
this new speed of their great air-cities would give them
and were exultant at the chance to annihilate com-
pletely the hated american federation and to ac-
complish that the very last great preparations were
going on now in every part of the air-city

   great loads of shining heat-shells were being trans-
ferred from the stores that had been brought to berlin
to the giant batteries of heat-guns around the citys
edge and its central plaza around the electrostatic
tower the cruisers of the european battle-fleet still
some two thousand in number were resting on all the
landing plazas and were being cared for and inspected
by hordes of green-uniformed attendants all other
air-craft were lowered into the great citys base-hangars
to be out of the way during the oncoming combat by
a stroke of genius on the part of berlins commander
the power of the great air-forts had been added to that
of the city itself by simply placing the air-forts here
and there on unused landing plazas where they formed
in effect great armored gun-turrets on the citys sur-
face and finally the mighty citys speed and power

to maneuver had been tested rigorously with all its
peoples inside its metal towers it was shot at terrific
speed low and high above the earth turning and dip-
ping and rising at that awful velocity like a flashing air-
plane rather than a gigantic city of the magnitude it
really had

  through all the hours of that night and the next
day the thirteenth of our imprisonment those great
preparations that unceasing rush of excited activity
continued night came and still the last preparations
were to be made magazines were being filled and
green-uniformed figures were swarming in countless
numbers in the streets going about their maneuvers
battle-cruisers were moving ceaselessly across the sky
during the hours of that night as hilliard and i sat
silent there high above all the tremendous turmoil of
the streets and plazas below we sometimes raised our
eyes to watch also the calm slow march of the great
constellations across the sky above glittering groups
of stars that seemed to look down with cool and con-
temptuous eyes upon all this mad flurry of human ex-
citement and human endeavor dozing a little now
and then we sat there until at last dawn sent its rosy
light across the world it was the last dawn i knew
that hilliard or i would look upon

  now it seemed all the preparations in the giant air-
city about us were completed the crowds that had
moved in its streets during the day and night before
remained but silent now with the thrill of approaching
combat tense and silent the city remained as the sun
crept up toward the zenith through the morning hours
of that fateful day and high in our tower-cell hil-
liard and i found ourselves gripped by the same tense
feeling of anticipation from our window as we
watched the city we made out the west a dark spot
rushing through the air toward berlin a spot that was
growing steadily larger in size that was broadening
out into a large dark disk and then as it came swiftly
closer we saw with astonishment that it was a city a
giant air-city almost as large as berlin itself

the gathering of the cities

we heard a stir of excitement in the streets below
as that mighty air-city came closer to us then
saw it slowing down until at last it had come smoothly
to rest out to the south of berlin hanging there in mid-
air a half dozen miles away it was london even
as i had recognized it hilliard had done so also lon-
don  the great air-city that held all southern england
for the european federation could be clearly recog-
nized not only by its size but by the somewhat different
architectural design of its metal towers and plazas
we could make out clearly now the surface of the other
city its huge batteries of heat-guns and its great tow-
ers surmounted by a central pinnacle and now as
we scanned the horizon away to the north we could
see another dark disk another mighty air-city rushing
swiftly toward us

  theyre gathering hilliards voice was agonized
gathering-all the air-cities of the european federa-
tion  its the beginning of the end

  gathering for their great attack i said

  god if connell and macklin could have escaped
hilliards cry burst from his tortured soul if our
own air-cities had only the speed and the power to re-
sist this attack

  steady hilliard i told him my hand on his shoul-
der its the end i think-the end for our federa-
tion as well as ourselves-but we must face it

now the air-city from the north was rushing closer
	air wonder stories

was hanging northward of berlin and we saw that
it was stockholm and even as it came to rest out
there beside us two other air-cities were rushing up
from the south looming larger swiftly and identifying
themselves when they too shot up to hang near our
central city as geneva and rome and then from the
west were coming others paris and brussels and am-
sterdam while down from the cold east were speeding
moscow and helsingforsand leningrad city after
city was rushing from all quarters of the compass from
every part of the european federation until they filled
the sky through the hours of that afternoon we
watched their numbers grow until they numbered over
a hundred they had come from every part of the
earth over which the european federation held sway
from the bleak eastern steppes from the jagged peaks
and green valleys of the pyrenees from the great ice-
locked fiords of the north and from the blue plains ot
southern africa they were rushing at colossal speed
to gather here in a great circle about their capital city-
berlin great air-cities each of which flashed through
the air at the same tremendous speed each of which
bore upon it great batteries of those giant heat-guns
that nothing else in the air could sustain each of which
held upon it a soaring electrostatic tower and thousands
of other clustered pinnacles as in berlin the crowd-
ing seething millions of its peoples had been left on
the ground quarters prepared for them the gathering
of the cities at last with the coming of sunset all
but the last few of the federations mighty air-cities
had gathered around berlin

  by then gazing out from our window high in the
electrostatic tower hilliard and i seemed to be looking
across a single gigantic city that stretched in mid-air
as far as the eye could reach so closely were the scores
of great hovering air-cities hanging together it was
as though we were looking forth across an endless plain
of clustered towers of metal from which rose here and
there the higher pinnacle of a citys power-source a
titanic plain of towers and streets of metal crowded
with millions of the european federations soldiery
and as the blood-red sunset flamed eastward upon
all this huge assemblage now waiting only for the last
of their number something seemed to snap in my brain
and all the stoicism which i had summoned to meet our
fate and our nations fate abruptly vanished

  we cant stay here while doom rushes upon our
nation i cried madly since they start out tonight
-since our time is up and we die ourselves tonight-
well go to death fighting for our freedom

  but now it was hilliard who endeavored to calm
me its useless brant he said a few hours
more then all will be rushing west while the asiatic
federation is moving east upon our air-cities and at
any moment now before that attack starts they will be
coming here for us

  but theyll not take us to a death like that i ex-
claimed a cold long-repressed fury surging up within
me if were to die well do it striking a blow at our
enemies

  like a caged tiger i paced the little cells interior
growing shadowy and dusky now the sun had dis-
appeared from the corridor outside came the voices
of the guards and at any moment i expected the door
to swing open and admit those who would take us to a
last examination at which our silence would bring im-
mediate death already far out over the great mass
of scores upon scores of giant air-cities that filled the
air about us a great complicated pattern of brilliant
lights was gleaming through the deepened twilight and

now from south and east and west the last of the
great european federations air-cities were assembling
about that tremendous gathered mass of cities then
as i turned from the metal door which i had been ex-
amining in blind and futile rage my eyes fell upon our
bunk-racks and the strong but slender strips of metal
that held them out from the metal wall against which
they were set diagonally and as i looked at them
an idea a last flame of hope burned into my brain
and i turned swiftly to hilliard

  those strips of metal  i exclaimed pointing toward
them those bunk-supports-its a chance to escape
a chance that means death hilliard i think-but death
is upon us now in any case-

  swiftly almost incoherently i explained to him the
idea that had suggested itself to me i heard his breath
catch as lie comprehended its appalling nature then
i saw his eyes gleam as he realized that inasmuch as
almost certain death awaited us death in escaping could
not deter us for we were already doomed so we
grasped one of the metal strips and tried with all
our force to tear its lower end loose from the metal
wall that lower end set directly in the wall seemed
integral with its metal and as we pulled upon the
metal strip gasping with our great effort muscles tired
we still kept on we had to work quietly lest some
sound betray us to the guards without it seemed that
we could never tear it loose straightening from the
violent exertion with dizzy heads muscles aching we
paused for a moment then reached to grasp the strip
again braced ourselves against the wall and exerted all
our force upon it it held for a terrible moment then
seemed to give to bend-and then with a little grating
sound we had pulled the strip loose from the wall into
which it had been set

            chapter viii
            a single chance

intently for a moment we listened without mov-
ing but there came no sound of alarm from with-
out nothing but the occasional voices of the guards
and now we grasped another of the metal bunk-sup-
ports and wrenched its metal strip loose from the wall
with another tremendous effort we had in our hands
two metal strips each of some three feet in length
these we now bent swiftly into two ls or right angles
of equal sides using all our combined strength on each
to bend the strong metal then swiftly loosening the
long strong leather belts that criss-crossed over our
black air-jackets we formed of them swiftly two leather
ropes ten feet in length each of these we attached
to one of our metal ls making each fast to one of
the jagged broken ends of one of the bent strips then
panting from our swift efforts we stood erect and
moved toward our little window

  night lay over the world now and from our window
we saw the cities illumined by their lights stretching
out to the horizon on the landing plazas of the air-
city beneath us rested the great european federation
battle-fleet in the plaza directly beneath us that which
surrounded the base of our great electrostatic tower
there rested but a few score of cruisers those of the
commanders who were now at the headquarters inside
the great towers base the plaza was practically de-
serted  for it was the evening meal for a moment i
stood there at the window gazing out over that tre-
mendous mass of giant air-cities then summoning
all my courage i flung my right leg over the windows
base through its opening
cities in

  sitting astride that opening while hilliard watched
anxiously behind me i placed the metal angle i carried
upon the flat metal sill of the window one end of its
angle catching on the sill while the other end to which
my leather rope was fastened pointed straight down-
ward toward the great plaza a thousand feet beneath
then holding to that leather rope i slid out of the
windows opening and hung by my hands from the
slender rope with only empty air between me and the
plaza far below tensely i swung there in that mo-
ment but the metal angle caught in the sill held my
weight and so sliding down the leather rope fastened
to it i felt my feet strike in a moment against the
sill of the window below another moment and i stood
upon that sill crouching within that windows opening

  the window in which i crouched opened into one
of the great upper corridors of the electrostatic tower
but i knew that to venture back into the building
swarming now with guards was to meet death nor
did i plan to do so giving my leather rope a twitch

i worked loose the angle resting on the sill above and
when that dropped toward me i placed it on the sill
on which i stood and the next moment was sliding
down to the window below and now above me hil-
liard using his own metal angle and leather rope in
the same way was following me was sliding from win-
dow to window after me down the smooth side of the
mighty pinnacle to the street far below down-down
-like two strange insects we crept downward from
window to window none in the streets below glimpsed
the two tiny shapes crawling down the mighty towers
side for the darkness had deepened now and in the
plaza directly beneath us there were none of the crowds
that swirled elsewhere

  our greatest danger indeed was that we would be
seen by someone inside the tower as we swung down
from window to window and twice i was forced to
hang for a few seconds from my leather rope above
a window inside which i could hear voices yet still
down and down we swung praying that the regular
line of windows in the static-towers side extended
unbroken clear to its base for otherwise we were lost
down and down we went moving more hastily now
despite the awful hazards of our progress so hastily
that once hilliards hook or angle slipped halfway out
from the sill upon which it hung and all but precipi-
tated him down to death before he could slide into
the window beneath him

  but now we were within the last dozen levels of the
plazas surface and were down with all the eagerness
of renewed hope for in the plaza there beneath us
there lay still the unguarded cruisers their officers and
crews gathered in the great tower down which we were
creeping another level-another-and down we swung
through the dusk in such a descent as surely man never
had made before the plaza was close beneath the
window of our cell now far above from far around
that plaza from berlin and from all the air-cities about
we heard the great hum of final preparations being
made i knew they were ready now to sally forth upon
their gigantic attack but we were within the last few
levels of the plaza now swinging down with mad
haste from window to window toward its smooth sur-
face and then it was when we were within a few
yards of that surface that i heard a dim cry from
far above

  down now with all your strength hilliard i i cried
to my friend above me theyve come to our cell
after us-are giving the alarm

  the nearest cruiser there below he exclaimed

the air	

thickly as he swung madly down after me well
make it yet

  but now the cry of our guards high above was being
taken up and repeated by other voices in the great
electrostatic tower that cry was coming down through
it from level to level even as we swung from the last
window to the level plaza and as we staggered across
it toward the open door of the nearest cruiser there
came a series of popping detonations from above and
the next moment little flares of terrific heat were burst-
ing all about us as the guards shot their heat cartridges
down toward us from their great height and through
the dusk their aim was poor and in a moment more
we were at the cruisers open door but now the alarm
was spreading over all the tower behind us and at the
same moment that we flung ourselves in through the
cruisers open door slamming it behind us we heard a
wild clamor of voices from the power-towers base

  the next instant though we were bursting up into
the cruisers bridge-room and for a moment of agony
i fumbled at its controls set differently from those of
our american cruisers then the motor-stud had
clicked beneath my fingers and as the great electric
motors beneath droned suddenly loud with the current
rushing through them i sent all their power into the
cruisers tube-propellers up it went rushing up and
away at terrific speed and at a steep slant even as a
mass of green-uniformed figures burst from the electro-
static tower into the plaza out and over that plaza at
terrific speed we shot out and upward at such awful
mounting velocity that before the great batteries of
heat-guns around us could turn before the alarm from
the power-tower had time to spread we were whirling
tip and through the dusk over all the massed towers
and gleaming lights of the great air-city berlin

  out and over-and now as we soared upward into
the rarefied levels of the air like a shooting-star our
cruiser was driving outward over the cities stabbing
westward through the air literally chasing the sun that
had disappeared hours before from berlin behind us
there rose a hundred cruisers soaring in swift and
deadly pursuit but so swift had been our rush so
tardy had been the alarm of our escape that before
the great batteries of berlin could blast us from the
air we were beyond them and before the other massed
air-cities over which we were rushing could receive
that alarm we had split the air westward above them
and had rushed out from over the last of their titanic
floating masses and into the night

  were clear of the cities i yelled to hilliard over
the thunderous droning of our motors and the roar of
winds about us if we can shake off these pursuing
cruisers well win back across the atlantic yet

  but their whole battle-fleet is rising now cried
hilliard gazing back and now all their air-cities
are beginning to move westward too-all their hundred
air-cities are moving west to the attack

across the atlantic

despite the wild peril of our rushing ship i felt
for a moment all the blood congealing around my
heart as hilliard yelled those words and i looked back-
ward for one last glimpse for there behind us behind
the hundred ships that were pursuing us the whole two
thousand cruisers of the european battle-fleet had risen
and were coming westward also they were not pur-
suing us so much as they were speeding westward ac-
cording to their plan moving after as in a great cres-
cent formation and behind them we could see now
all the hundred gigantic air-cities of the european fed-
	air wonder stories

eration massed there in a colossal circular formation
about their central city of berlin moving westward
also behind the crescent of their fleet they were flash-
ing with terrible majesty through the air in their cir-
cular-massed formation at a speed that mounted
swiftly to two hundred miles an hour

  the great attack had begun

  only a moment i gazed back upon that colossal spec-
tacle never seen by man before and knew that in that
moment far on the worlds other side the hundred
great air-cities of the asiatic federation would be rush-
ing eastward the two great forces of hurtling air-
cities were converging upon the american federation
then as we shot forward with our own greater and
terrific speed the vast massed cities and the fleet before
them had passed from sight behind us and only the
hundred grim pursuing cruisers were visible in the
night as we hurtled on

  on-on-and now i shouted to hilliard to go be-
neath to the cruisers motor room he moved down
toward them while i gripped the wheel tightly standing
there alone in the bridge-room of the long great cruiser
that had but hilliard and i inside it and while we
hurtled on at our maximum terrible speed as the cruis-
ers behind drove steadily after us we realized that we
and our pursuers were outracing the sun around the
earth  we saw by the growing light that we were high
above the sea instead of land the sea tliat we saw
through breaks in the vapor-layer gleamed to the west
of us with sunset lines we were over the atlantic
and now as hope of escape from our pursuers burned
stronger within me there came a sudden faltering in
the steady drone of our great motors i felt our
cruiser lose speed in that moment knew that faltering
to be caused by the circuit-breakers tripping at the tre-
mendous power we were using but then after an
awful moment of hesitation the motors were droning
as loudly as ever as hilliard beneath had thrown back
the circuit-breakers in the connections that conveyed
the static electricity from the atmospheric charge about
us to our transformers only a moment had we fal-
tered thus but in that moment the hundred pursuers
behind had come swiftly closer

  coward still like some phantom we rushed minute
after minute of droning racing flight with the sun-
set ahead flaming brilliant now as we overtook it
steadily the long gleaming ships behind us were creep-
ing closer while the sun rose in the western sky
though hilliard was working like a madman in the
motor-room beneath tending the motors as a mother
anxiously watches her child he was but one and could
not do the work of a dozen and so on after us they
came drawing toward us so close that at last i knew
that we could not win free of them in our frenzied
flight for although we had rushed on for a time
that seemed endless to us and a few hundred miles
remained between us and the american coast their
leaders were so near now that another minute i knew
would find them using their bow guns upon us

  even as the thought came to me there was a thunder-
ing detonation behind us and then but a few feet to
either side a shining heat-shell flashed past us an-
other detonation and another followed and i knew that
not for long could we escape them thus since with each
moment the shooting was becoming more accurate so
just as a dozen of their bow guns thundered again i
suddenly drove the cruiser downward in a flying head-
long plunge down through the vapor-layer beneath us
and as the pursuing ships plunged straight down after
us i sent our own cruiser instantly whirling upward

 and through that layer once more

   it was a maneuver that gained us a moments advan-
 tage since when the pursuing ships drove up through
 the vapor-masses again on my track it took them an
 instant to locate and shape their course after me in
 that instant we had moved a little from them but now
 remorselessly as ever they came on after us as pur-
 sued and pursuing ships drove like light toward the
 flaming western sky on and on on until again they
 were close behind until again their guns were begin-
 ning to thunder and then i repeated my former ma-
 neuver my last resort i dived headlong downward
 again through the vapor-layer and upward again as
 their ships drove after me but when i flashed up
 again through the vapor-masses this time i suddenly
 slowed my ship slowed it and then held it motionless
 there in mid-air with cold of icy fear tight around my
 heart in that moment for this time half of the
 hundred pursuing ships had not dived down after me
 but had flashed on ahead as i drove down and so
 now when i flashed up they hung before me while the
 remainder drove still toward me from behind i was
 trapped at last between their masses of ships before
 and behind me

   slowing my cruiser holding it motionless there with
 mechanical fingers in that moment i knew it to be
 the end our last moment had come the two masses
 of ships were moving toward me from ahead and be-
 hind were moving toward our cruiser our only escape
 cut off no twists or turns now could save us they
 were converging upon us were moving deliberately
 toward us from either side another moment i knew
 and hundreds of heat-guns would thunder from them
 hundreds of heat-shells would send our ship down-
 ward in flaring fusing destruction another moment-
 a great cry sounded beside me and i wheeled to find
 hilliard pointing mutely upward toward a mass of
 long gleaming shapes that were rushing headlong down
 upon us from high above that were diving headlong
 down upon the european cruisers to east and west of
 us raining a hail of heat-shells upon them american
 ships my cry was echoing hilliards great gleam-
  ing cruisers outnumlering the hundred east and west
 of us were driving down upon those hundred with all
  their heat-guns thundering then in the next moment
  while our own cruiser hung motionless helpless there
 in mid-air american and european cruisers were whirl-
 ing in a mad swift battle about us ships striking and
 falling like lightning on all sides of us and before
 we could comprehend with our stunned minds what was
 taking place the european cruisers had suddenly
 dropped from that battle had massed together and were
 splitting the air eastward rushing back eastward and
 disappearing toward the mighty approaching armada
 of great air-cities and cruisers of which they were the
 scouts

   now from the mass of the american cruisers one
 shot toward our own level and hung beside our own
 ship and as its door was flung open we opened the door
 of our own i stared at a tall figure not crediting my
 eyes

   macklin i cried as i recognized him macklin
 you got clear then

   brant-hilliard- he was himself exclaiming
 it is you two in that ship then we were sent on a
 last patrol out here saw your ship attacked by other
 european ships came to your rescue-

   we escaped from berlin i told him but you
 macklin we thought you and connell dead saw your
 cruiser struck by heat-shells and falling-
cities in

  it was a last ruse macklin swiftly explained
those pursuing ships were overtaking us so when
their batteries fired a storm of heat-shells after us we
fired one of our own heat-guns back toward them at
the same time and our shells meeting one or two of the
oncoming ones made them burst and flare there behind
us then at the next moment we sent our ship whirl-
ing down as though struck and destroyed

  but connell then i cried connell got back with
his great secret all the hundred european federation
air-cities are rushing across the atlantic to the attack i

  we leaped across the gap to the gangway the door
of macklins cruiser closed behind us and he gave the
order that sent it with the whole cruiser fleet west-
ward at swiftly mounting speed then he turned back
to us

  connell got back with his secret yes he said
and though the hundred european federation air-
cities are rushing westward and word has come that the
massed hundred asiatic federation cities also are rush-
ing eastward for the attack they will find the great
air-cities of the american federation massed together
and ready for them in the ten days since our return
every effort of our cities has been exerted to make use
of connells knowledge and to equip with the new
tube-propellers that will give them the same tremendous
speed as our enemies and now all our cities are
massed together and waiting for the attack of our
enemies

chapter ix
the battle of the air-cities

now the hundred cruisers of our force were
cleaving the air westward at terrific speed while
macklin and hilliard and i stood together in
the bridge-room of the foremost as it rushed on be-
neath us the gray atlantic showed here and there
through openings in the vapor-masses and ahead the
sun still hung in the western sky and within a few
minutes more we saw that the vapor-layer beneath was
thinning and that now we were flashing not over the
sea but over land over green hills and valleys that we
could glimpse rushing past far beneath us i gazed to
north and south in search of new york and the other
coastal air-cities that should have hung there but noth-
ing was in sight

  all our american federation air-cities macklin
told me are massed together hanging south of the
great lakes from buenos aires to winnipeg theyve
come

  you think then that the european and asiatic
federation air-cities are going to make a simultaneous
attack from both sides i shouted to him above the
roaring of our flight he nodded emphatically

  undoubtedly the asiatic federation cities are
over the pacific now and are keeping in touch with the
european ones by distance-phone to time their attack
to coincide from east and west they know our own
cities have massed together must know now that theyve
been equipped with the great new spced-tubes also
but theyre coming on

two to one i said two hundred air-cities at-
tacking our one hundred god what a battle it will be

  but now hilliard had broken into our conversation
was pointing far ahead toward a tiark flat mass that
stood out against the brilliant western sky and toward
which we were moving the terrific speed at which we
had been racing on for hours was decreasing now far
beneath the land was still rolling back at great speed
long green plains now since already we had flashed

the air	

west over the alleghanies then as the dark mass
westward grew steadily with our approach to it other
ships were driving suddenly beside our own watchful
patrols that drove down upon ojir hundred cruisers and
swiftly challenged them macklin answered those chal-
lenges by the distance-phone but for the moment i paid
small attention to him gazing forward with heart beat-
ing rapidly at the great mass that hung high in mid-
air before us for as we drove closer toward that
mass it was becoming visible to our eyes as our goal
the hundred giant air-cities of the american federation 
the hundred mighty american federation air-cities
were clustered there miles above the green plains in a
great circular mass with new york most colossal of
all of them at the center cities that had long hung
over north and south america from sea to sea air-
cities whose names were those of the long-vanished
cities of the land that once had dotted the surface of
those continents boston and los angeles rio de
janeiro and chicago mexico city and quebec val-
paraiso and miami-these and scores of others hung
there in that great cluster all the air-cities of the
american federation were gathered here about their
air-capital of new york to withstand the tremendous
attacks now closing in from east and west i
massed there as they were the hundred mighty air-
cities seemed even as the european ones had seemed
to me but one vast plain of metal towers and streets
as far as the eye could reach there stretched away
the tremendous forest of those soaring towers with
here and there rising from them the taller spires of
each citys great electrostatic tower and everywhere
among those towers everywhere around the rim of
each great circular air-city and at its center there loomed
great batteries of giant heat-guns while here and there
on the plazas of the cities rested the turret-like cubes
of the recalled great air-forts their own grim heat-
guns protruding expectantly and through streets and
towers between the batteries and around the air-forts
and across the plazas of the assembled cities there
swarmed the millions of their peoples wild with excite-
ment now as the last dread hour approached and
massed there above all the great floating cities hung
grim and motionless the two thousand or more cruisers
that still remained of the american federations eastern
and western fleets

  it was toward these massed battle-cruisers at a level
somewhat higher than that of the air-cities that our
own hundred cruisers were rushing over those assem-
bled giant cities we raced the great mass of them
below us almost hiding the ground beneath as we
shot above them i saw now that they had been ranged
in a tremendous circle the great capital of new york
hanging in the center across the great ring of the air-
cities we rushed were racing at last above new york
toward its own giant power-tower then we had
reached it and were sinking vertically downward until
our hundred cruisers came to rest upon the central
plaza here even as in berlin the central plaza was
reserved always for the ships of the first air chief
and his followers so that although immense crowds
now beat through all the streets and plazas about it
there were none around our hundred ships and in
an instant macklin and hilliard and i were out of that
which had brought us and hastening across the clear
space toward the static-towers base

preparations

on past its guards and through the ante-rooms we
strode and in another moment were in the office
	air wonder stories

of the first air chief there was unfamiliar appa-
ratus among the great switchboards of its walls i noted
as we entered the first air chief himself had risen
from his great table-map as we entered and was com-
ing toward us beside him another figure whom i
recognized instantly as connell then both of them
were grasping the hands of hilliard and of myself

  brant yarnall was exclaiming i got macklins
report of your escape and his rescue of you-man but
im glad that you got free and it was what you did
there in berlin what you did to help connell and
macklin escape that has enabled us to use connells
knowledge and fit our air-cities for the coming battle

  i did no more than the others i told him but
you know of the enemys coming then you know
that already the european federation cities are on their
way 

  he nodded they and the asiatic federations
cities from the westward brant he said and we
are awaiting them here-awaiting them with a chance
at least thanks to you four-to strike back at them
when they come and already they are near-by the
map here you can see-

  and he turned toward the great table-map upon
which was depicted the whole of the earths surface the
red circles upon it tlenoting as before the position of
the air-cities that hung above it now however all
the circles of the american federation cities were
massed together south of the white outline of the great
lakes hanging motionless as the cities around us were
hanging motionless away to the east on the map
though just moving in from the atlantic over the
eastern coast there was creeping across the map an-
other mass of red circles moving slowly toward our
own that represented the great gathered cities of the
european federation that were rushing westward
toward us and in from the pacific was creeping a
similar mass of a hundred little red circles that were
i knew the asiatic federations cities

  from east and west they were moving there on
the map moving even as the cities they represented
moved through the air automatically showing their
positions and progress this was accomplished i knew
by means of special batteries of cruiser-finders tuned
and trained to detect the great electro-static motors of
air-cities and recording instantly thus whenever those
cities moved with their great electric fields their
records were carried through complicated mechanical
calculators which plotted the exact positions and move-
ments of the cities and these calculators in turn were
connected to small special projectors set beneath the
great ground-glass table-map casting upward upon it
the red circles of the air-cities thus those red circles
moved upon the map even as the great air-cities moved
across the world

  this arrangement indeed was of no late date and
was used by both european and asiatic federations
as well as by ourselves but as i gazed now about
the great circular room i saw that within it were some
new arrangements also these consisted of a series
of six great glass screens which were arranged in box-
like form about the great air-citys controls at the
rooms center and while the first air chief swiftly
explained to us their purpose and design i saw that
one sitting inside their box-fonn with four on four
sides and one above and one below could see in
all those directions as though from the very top of
the great power-tower for they were in effect great
electrical periscopes four great similar screens had
been set on four sides of the electro-static towers high

tip and another one above that tip while the sixth had
been set in the under-side of the great citys base the
views possible to those six screens were then trans-
ferred down to the six there about us the light-vibra-
tions that struck the screens above and beneath being
transformed by television receivers into electrical vibra-
tions and brought down to television reproducers behind
our own six screens

   sitting there at the citys controls amid those six
screens and looking into them one could see as clearly
as though from the power-towers tip in all directions
it was quite necessary too that this should be the case
since the man who operated the great air-city from
its six direction-controls and its single speed control
there must see clearly in all directions now that the
great air-cities could rush at such tremendous speed
through the air when i said as much to the first
air chief who had turned now and was gazing intently
at the great table-map upon which the eastern and
western masses of circles were slowly creeping toward
our own he nodded and contemplated me for a mo-
ment with a curious expression

  the man he said finally who is to hold the
controls of new york in the battle tomorrow will be
you brant

  the honor is great i said ive operated the
citys controls though never did i expect to take it into
battle but macklin and hilliard here-i want them
to stay here for the time being-i want the hundred
cruisers on the plaza outside to stay there during the
battle

  you have a plan the first air chief asked but
i shook my head

  no more than an idea i said an idea that may
help us if the battle goes against us if their attack is
too strong for us even then it is too insane perhaps
to be of any use but it might help us-

   yarnall nodded assent and then macklin and hilliard
had joined the two dozen or more of black-garbed at-
tendants and engineers who were busy at the great
switchboards that lined the circular rooms walls they
scrutinized its dials to determine the rate of the vast
currents rushing down from the power-towers tip far
above to the motors in the citys great base added a
fresh battery of transformers or threw in resistances
to hold that curtent steady and moved ceaselessly
about the walls in their anxious watch now yarnall
and connell and i were marking our own places the
three metal seats there behind the big table-map with
the great screens of the electrical periscopes all about
us yarnall would sit in the center with eyes upon
the red circles on the great map tensely watching their
progress as admiral of our mighty fleet of colossal
cities ready to direct it and our cruisers to the battle
connell would be at his right before him the black
mouthpiece and speaker of a single distance-phone
behind that were the scores of switches and intricate
controls which connected that distance-phone to the
operators of all our hundred air-cities

the battle nears

as the third of the trio i would sit at yamalls
left before me the six switch-levers which sent
the colossal city of new york whirling through
the air in any direction while beside them was the
gleaming knob which regulated the citys speed the
great batteries of new york were at my command also
all their mighty heat-guns around the citys edge and
around our electro-static tower and elsewhere were con-
trolled by the distance-phone whose mouthpiece rose
cities in

before me the great batteries of all our other cities
were controlled in the same way by their own oper-
ators and were subject like new york to the com-
mands of the first air chiaf beside me who could
maneuver our whole great armada of tremendous cities
at will through the air in the city of san francisco
too we knew was the second air chief placed there
to take command in case new york were destroyed or
the first air chief disabled

  thus on the morrow were grouped we three who
were to sway such colossal forces in a battle as no men
had seen before now yarnall was pointing to the
table-maps surface where the red massed circles of the
european and asiatic federation armadas were in-
dicated but a few hundred miles on either side of our
own great mass of cities watching them there we sat
in silence save for the clicking of occasional switches
by the engineers about us from far away far across
new york and all the other air-cities gathered around
it there was coming the dull dim throbbing of the life
of millions that swarmed through those cities and
now yarnall reached forward and touched the control
of the great electrical periscopes whose screens boxed
us in

  instantly those dull glass screens were alive with
light and it was as though we were gazing forth from
the very tip of the power-tower out over our gathered
mass of cities north and east and south and west
from all the screens about us the views were alike of
a tremendous mass of clustered metal towers that en-
circled new york below us was the screen above
which our metal seats were suspended on supports it
seemed a trap-door through which we were gazing down
toward the green plains far beneath though in reality
all the citys massive base lay between us and that view
so intensely realistic was the scene that lay about us
that we all but forgot the great circular room in which
we really were and seemed suspended high in air above
the great mass of our gathered air-cities

  the enemy armadas said yarnall his voice low
will be in sight within fifteen minutes

  for upon the map the two masses of red circles were
rushing on from east and west and seemed now almost
upon the mass of circles that was our own great fleet
of cities looking out over those cities through the
periscopic screens about us we could see the forts
raising their great guns to firing range i realized as
i saw it that the battle now ready to start would mean
annihilation to half the world this was indeed arma-
geddon when on earth itself was left no human being
at peace when every nation was rushing through the
air toward this last conflict 

  now however yarnall touched another control and
from the electro-static towers tip high above us flashed
great signals of brilliant lights that were taken up and
repeated from all the power-towers of all the hundred
cities that ringed us round and as those signals
flashed the great crowds that filled the streets of the
air-cities were suddenly flowing out of those streets
into the cities towers until within a few moments none
were visible in all the streets and plazas save those
black-uniformed men who stood ready at the great
heat-gyns of our batteries and those crowds went
quietly despite their tense excitement because they
knew that they were being ordered inside for their
greater protection there was no refuge upon the
earths surface far beneath for them when the destruc-
tive powers of all the world were battling above it in
the air

the air	

  then the first air chief spoke a brief order and
as connell beside him repeated it swiftly into the dis-
tance-phone as he did with yarnalls orders in all the
combat that followed the great fleet of cruisers hang-
ing above us and visible in our top screen divided into
two masses of a thousand or more ships each which
swept swiftly to east and west beyond the great ring
of air-cities they leaped until they were far out and
each division then formed into a great curving line
screening our ring of cities to east and west facing the
fleets rushing toward them from those directions then
we were gazing again at the table-map before us a
deathly silence seeming to grip all the world upon that
map we could see the european and asiatic armadas
were now within hardly more than a hundred miles of
our own and tensely we watched the east and western
screens now gazing out beyond our cities

  theyll use their cruiser-fleets for their first attack
yarnall was saying as we gazed tensely forth theyll
try to wipe out ou cruisers before they bring their
cities on to attack ours

  i nodded it would give them a big advantage
when the cities come to blows but our cruisers beat
them back once with the odds two to one and now-

  i broke off sharply and at the same moment heard
a low breath from yarnall and connell simultaneously
felt seemingly a low tremor that seemed to run in-
stantaneously across all our massed air-cities for
there far to the westward black against the sky there
had appeared a line of far-flung black dots that were
growing very quickly in size and that were massed to-
gether in a crescent formation whose horns were toward
us it was the advancing cruiser-fleet of the asiatic
federation forces tensely we watched it as it came
on then we looked to the east to see a similar crescent
of advancing dots the european cruiser fleet on they
came smoothly rushing toward our own lines of
cruisers hanging to the east and west of our cities and
then for the moment we forgot them as we made out
to east and west behind them advancing toward us
great black masses that even at that distance seemed
to fill the air they were the two massed mighty
armadas of the european and asiatic federations air-
cities rushing to battle with our own

           chapter x
           the first clash

for one moment we gazed toward them and toward
the advancing cruisers that rushed before them as
though held by the grandeur of the spectacle the
tremendous mass of our air-cities hanging there high
above the earth the gleaming ranks of our own two
thousand cruisers that poised to east and west the
advancing cruiser-fleets of twice their strength behind
which there rushed gigantically on the great massed
air-cities of our enemies-it was a spectacle breath-
taking enough but then the two enemy cruiser fleets
had come within a short distance of our own waiting
cruisers and as they did so both their fleets shot
suddenly upward as though in answer to a common
order to drive above our own cruisers and our air-
cities 

  instantly yarnall had uttered a swift order and as
connells quick voice sent that order flying out to our
cruiser-masses they too whirled upward and forward
to meet the onrushing enemy fleets then far out in
mid-air to east and west of us the great cruiser fleets
had met had smashed into each other with blind fury


air wonder stories

through our screens we saw cruisers enveloped by
scores in blinding flares in that first moment of combat
as they raged in two separate mighty battles

  but east and west our own cruisers were outnum-
bered two to one and despite their fierce resistance
were being pressed steadily back toward our gathered
cities goser and closer through the air toward us
were reeling those struggling lines of cruisers more
and more american ships falling in white-hot destruc-
tion as the heat-guns of their opponents concentrated
upon them still far beyond them to east and west
the colossal masses of the european and asiatic air-
cities were now rushing on toward us yamall sent
another order flying out and the next moment a mass
of cruisers that had remained at the edges of our gath-
ered cities on either side and had not been in the first
battle were leaping forward now like suddenly re-
leased hounds after prey a score of them to the
eastern combat and a score to the western one they
flashed and each as it reached the lines of struggling
ships shot up over them and then flashed along their
lines above them and as they did there shot down-
ward from them over the battling cruisers intense jets
of concentrated water vapor which puffed out instantly
into great white cloud masses that enveloped all the
grappling thousands of ships	

  yamall had brought into the battle i saw those
great artificial cloud projectors that had saved us in
our first great battle over the atlantic and even
as their white masses enveloped the struggling ships
he sent forth another order and our own cruisers shot
upward and downward out of those cloud-masses at
the very instant that they had been formed then
with all our own cruisers clear of the cloud-masses to
east and west and the european and asiatic ships in-
side them driving for the moment in blind confusion
our cruisers poured a deadly hail of heat-shells down
into the cloud-masses and the thousands of ships that
swirled inside them only for a moment was it that
they remained within the cloud-masses before fighting
their way free but in that moment they had been un-
able to fire a single effective shell at our own ships
outside and we had poured a veritable storm of deadly
shells into the cloudy masses so when a moment
later the european and asiatic ships broke from the
vapor-clouds east and westward our broadsides had
taken toll of hundreds of their blinded ships and hardly
more than our own forces did they number now

  but when they broke free from the cloud-masses
and into open air again they did not advance toward
our awaiting ships instead they shot back from either
front toward their cities in answer to some mysteriflus
order at once a similar order from yamall brought
flashing back to form again above our own cities our
own ships-still nearly two thousand strong and almost
as many in number as the combined cruisers of our
enemies i heard dimly the great cheers that were
rolling across all our cities for this mighty blow which
had beaten back our enemies cruiser-fleets once more
then those cheers died swiftly away for far away to
east and west the gigantic masses of the approaching
air-cities loomed larger and larger rushing through
the air toward us

  eastward the european federation was approaching
in a gigantic circle that seemed to fill the whole eastern
sky to us three sitting there amid our periscopic
screens it was as though all the eastern screen was
filled with that great oncoming mass of cities paris
london moscow cairo rome-all the tremendous
air-cities of the great european federation-and their

capital of berlin still at the center

  and westward upon our western screen loomed
equally gigantic the similar circle of air-cities of the
asiatic federation peking the third in size of the
worlds air-capitals at the center of its cluster of cities
rushed at the same smooth speed toward us with
shanghai and tokio and bombay and rangoon fore-
most in its circle from east and west thus the two
stupendous circles of cities rushed toward our own
grimly waiting and as we watched them there flashed
over me in that tense moment a strange wonder as
to the feelings with which one of a hundred years
before would have watched this battle then i laid
aside that passing wonder as the two great circles drew
nearer to the range of our great heat-gun batteries
and this surely was a spectacle that none had ever
seen or dreamed before-this spectacle of the worlds
mighty cities converging swiftly upon each other in
battle to the death

  and as strange too must have been the sight of us
three sitting there amid our box-like periscopic screens
the heart of the mighty towers base yet seeing and
directing from there all the great mass of the hundred
mighty cities around us

  theyre not going to join forces i exclaimed
theyre going to strike us at the same moment from
east and west

  yamall nodded his eyes intent upon the screens
either that he said or-

he broke off suddenly for at that moment there
came to us a giant salvo of thunder from both
east and west a terrific shock of sound that rolled
deeply through the air toward us from the two distant
armadas advancing an instant later there was a
whistling sound over our own cities and we knew that
a great storm of heat-shells was plunging toward them
a few struck with wild bursting flares across our
massed cities and with their suddenly-released gigantic
heat there appeared great craters of fusing melting
metal the greater part of the shells though fell
short whirled down to earth to flash on the ground
far below the range was not yet closed i knew and
so far our own great cities remained silent as death
yamall was watching now with hands clenched tightly
as the two circles from east and west came on a
moment later there rolled from them another great
salvo and another mass of shells rushed toward us
but though most of these also fell short a greater
number than before flared and fused in melting sear-
ing death upon our own massed cities

  i gazed anxiously at yamall a strange dread taking
possession of me for an instant as the tremendous
armadas came on would he never give the order to
fire he was sitting still as a carved statue his eyes
upon the screens and his lips compressed and in that
moment there came to me a dim sense of all the ter-
rific responsibility that weighed upon him the leader
of a third of earths cities and peoples battling against
the remainder of mankind silent he sat and still while
the great approaching armadas rushed nearer their
cities coming more and more distinctly into view in
our far-seeing screens in another moment i knew
another thunderous broadside would be belching toward
us but just as i looked for it to come yamall spoke
a single word and as connells swift voice sent that
word flying out to all our cities as my own flashed it
to all the batteries of our centermost city of new york
there was a hush of a split-second and then out

armageddon
cities in the air	

from all our own hundred giant cities there broke such
a titanic thundering detonation as seemed to shake
violently all the air about us and an instant later
we saw the heat-shells from our batteries falling in
thousands upon the two advancing armadas upon their
rushing gigantic cities and flaring into white-hot craters
of fusing roetal

  before that terrific blow the two advancing masses
seemed to stagger a little in mid-air to hesitate for
an instant but then they advanced steadily onward
and their own great batteries thundered an answer to
our salvo then as the two giant circles drew nearer
to our own on either side the whole world seemed
swallowed again in one ceaseless thundering of sound
the giant batteries of all our great air-cities burst forth
again to send a storm of heat-shells rushing east and
west upon our enemies the air between us and the
armadas nearing on either side must have been filled
with shells in that moment for we saw tremendous
flares there in mid-air as shells of ours met some of
theirs and burst but few of them did that most of
them whirling through the air to burst and flare in all
their awful destroying heat and brilliance upon the
air-cities

  in that instant as the batteries of all three gigantic
armadas thundered it seemed that numberless foun-
tains of brilliant light and terrific heat were springing
into being amid the metal towers of all the three masses
of great air-cities great fountains of heat unthink-
able beneath which all the metal about them fused and
melted instantly and about which all life was scorched
into annihilation yet this had taken but the first
moment of the battle to accomplish and now as the
two great circles of the european and asiatic federa-
tions swept nearer i saw that two of the foremost of
the great european cities paris and lisbon were stag-
gering and reeling as they rushed forward with the
rest they had met an awful storm of striking heat-
shells from our own cities and though their great
motors were deep in their mighty bases though the
alloy of their electrostatic towers could not be affected
by heat-shells yet the deadly hail of shells that had
fallen upon them had penetrated apparently almost
down to their great motors beneath

  i whirled to yarnall paris and lisbon i cried
theyre falling behind the rest a little-theyre hit
hard

  he nodded eyes burning now all east batteries
concentrate on paris and lisbon he ordered and
as connells voice sent the order flying out to our eastern
massed cities their batteries were thundering with even
greater fury

  but now all their shells were aimed toward the two
crippled cities of paris and lisbon and a hell of burst-
ing shells were flaring across those two ill-fated giants
of the air it was as though a living wave of bril-
liant heat and light from the bursting shells were dan-
cing like lightning across the two cities and in that
instant it must have burned from them all the life in
their towers even as they were striving to do with
our own the towers of each city became in that
moment almost a single great surface of fusing white-
hot metal its awfulness added to by the exploding of
the stores of heat-shells and magazines leneath the
terrific flares out beyond them and around them
there swept other cities of the european armada to
protect them there came madrid and london and
moscow all their guns thundering answer but now
our own gunners were not to be denied of their prey
as our batteries sent repeated storms of shells upon

the two doomed cities we saw paris staggering slip-
ping to a lower level hanging a moment there and
then whirling sidewise downward down to the green
earth far below in a moment it had crashed with a
terrific rending and cracking of metal

  i heard a dull roar of cheers rolling across our city
above and between the thunder of the guns cheers that
were redoubled a moment later as lisbon too whirled
downward to annihilation a mere mass of fusing metal
but even as the cheers sounded they were stilled and
yarnall was uttering further orders to our batteries

  from the asiatic federations circle a great smoth-
ering fire of shells had been falling in those moments
upon the westernmost of our own cities upon omaha
its guns were still thundering in savage answer but
battery by battery they were going silent as there fell
upon them the concentrated fire of the whole advancing
asiatic federation cities the great guns of peking
thundering at the center of the rest then omaha
too had slipped and staggered and was whirling down
to earth in fusing destruction its motors reached by
the bursting shells at last

avoiding the ambush

now it seemed as though in all the world was
nothing but thundering guns and bursting shells
for now as they came nearer toward each other the three
great circles of cities were exchanging a veritable tem-
pest of heat-shells upon each other watching that
hell of battle through our screens we three sat tensely
there yamalls eyes were intent upon the advancing
armadas connell gripping his distance-phone was
barking orders to the great cities that were thundering
about us the two giant circles of the enemies cities
were very near our own now rushing toward us at
their tremendous speed and as they thus neared us
it seemed that nothing could surpass the tremendous
roaring broadsides that were hurled from city to city
i saw amsterdam and madrid staggering a little behind
their fellows reeling beneath our awful fire saw hong-
kong in the asiatic forces its great towers all but
evelled by the flaring heat-shells plunge suddenly down-
ward as more of those shells reached its motors but
in our own mass now new orleans was plunging like-
wise beneath the fire of the advancing fleets and st
louis was swaying as though badly hit

  but at that moment there came an abrupt exclama-
tion from yamall and then we saw that the two ad-
vancing circles of the enemy cities rushing toward our
own were changing their form were changing swiftly
into two great crescents of which the horns of each
were toward us those two giant crescents were mov-
ing to join each other to form one great circle and
if they did so our own mass of cities would be com-
pletely surrounded by the overwhelming numbers of
our enemies the easy target for all their mighty bat-
teries we would inevitably be annihilated by the
enclosing circle of the enemy but even before i had
understood that maneuver yamalls swift order was
flashing out to all our gathered cities

  north at full speed for all cities unchanged for-
mation 

  the next instant our whole great mass of cities was
moving was moving with swiftly mounting speed north-
ward for as his order sounded i had jerked open
the speed-control before me had flung back one of the
direction-levers and as i did so there had come a
great droning of motors from beneath resounding even
above the madly-thundering guns flinging all the mighty
city of new york northward also there came the
	air wonder stories

great hissing of the numberless new tube-propellers
that were jerking it swiftly forward and as new
york leaped northward at my touch all its great bat-
teries still detonating so were all the great air-cities
that ringed us leaping northward and all their guns
were still thundering toward the advancing armadas

  but now the enemy had seen our swift leap north-
ward and as their commanders guessed our purpose
they sent their own two crescents whirling toward us
with even greater speed to enclose us before we could
escape for the next moment it was a race between
the three great city-masses a race in which our own
sought to evade the two that closed upon it from either
side and as our cities and theirs raced through the
air at tremendous speed ev gun still firing it seemed
that we must lose for just north of us the two
northward horns of the closing crescents had almost
met were almost joined before us that northward
horn of the asiatic crescent held shanghai and colombo
and singapore and others while the horn that pro-
jected from the european mass had foremost in it mos-
cow and brussels and algiers and as we shot north-
ward in that wild moment to escape before those two
horns could join yamall sent flying forth a swift order
for all batteries in all our cities to concentrate their
fire now upon the foremost cities in the two closing
horns to the north

  at once our own guns were thundering with re-
doubled fury for unless we could destroy in the next
few minutes the foremost of those cities north of us
they would have closed upon us and brought our irre-
trievable doom so disregarding for the time all the
other air-cities of the two closing crescents about us
all fire was concentrated upon the foremost cities of
the two horns closing northward a storm of heat-
shells rushed thick through the air toward them but
at the same time the masses of european and asiatic
cities east and west of us were pouring down upon us
the broadsides of their own giant batteries and be-
neath that terrific fire cities among our mass were
falling swift in fusing destruction st louis and
miami and seattle were whirling to death as we raced
onward all the people in them who had been left
alive by the shells were meeting annihilation in the great
crash far below

  but though we were being decimated by the fire of
the closing crescents on either side our own terrific
concentrated fire was having effect upon the closing
horns of cities north of us and in the moments while
we rushed toward them singapore colombo and brus-
sels had been sent down in white-hot destruction by
our awful fire the remaining cities in those two pro-
jecting horns were still rushing toward each other with
their utmost speed to close the gap between them before
our great circle could speed through it with moscow
and shanghai at their eastern and western tips the two
homs swiftly closed toward each other while as swiftly
and with every motor droning its loudest with every
heat-gun thundering northward we shot onward for
a moment the whole great race was in doubt for a
moment it seemed to us that our great mass of cities
coild flash through that gap before it closed

  but as we watched in tense terrible hope even as
our mighty cities raced northward the cities of those
closing homs seemed to make a last supreme effort
a last great burst of speed they shot forward their
leaders shanghai and moscow almost racing into each
other and then with all their tube-propellers reversed
they were suddenly halting a barrier of mighty air-
cities all around us but nothing now could halt our

tremendous mass so awful was our speed and so close
were we to the enemys line i saw those cities loom-
ing suddenly gigantic before our own mass as we raced
on heard hoarse exclamations from yarnall and con-
nell beside me and then with a terrific shock that
seemed the shock of meeting worlds our vast north-
ward-flying mass of air-cities had crashed headlong
into the great line of cities before us

           chapter xi
           city against city

in the moment that followed after our flashing circle
of cities had thundered headlong into the line before
us all other sounds all the thunder of countless
guns and the drone of motors and the hiss of tube-
propellers and cries of voices were drowned in one
tremendous splintering crash of metal upon metal the
giant mass of cities about us seemed to reel drunkenly
in mid-air in that moment new york at their center
staggered from the awful shock transmitted to it then
upon the screen north of me i saw titanic metal masses
that had been cities falling downward moscow with
sydney and algiers and boston with detroit these
whirled downward in that moment-no longer recog-
nizable as air-cities and seeming to the eye but great
twisted bulks of rended metal

  but not even that giant collision had been able to
halt the tremendous momentum of our northward-
thundering mass of cities for as those cities before
us crashed downward the whole great circle of our
mass new york still at its center was thundering on
through the gap that that crash had made in the line
before us we were sweeping northward and out
beyond that line that our great crash had shattered we
had won free only by means of that awful crash in-
stantly yarnall had cried another order and our great
mass of air-cities was swiftly shifting its formation
into a long line and at its head rushed our own city
of new york and then while the great circle of the
enemys combined armada remained there for the mo-
ment still behind us as though stunned by our colossal
crash and escape through it the first air chief sent
another order flashing forth at once our line turned
like a wheeling snake high in the air and was rushing
back upon the circle of our enemies we were rush-
ing back and along the line of european federation
cities that made up that circles eastern half for the
moment and as our long line of mighty cities whirled
past them all our batteries were thundering upon them
roaring death

  the advantage now was all with us since in their
great circular formation more than half their great
mass of cities could not reach us with their guns and
so during that moment the odds were more than even
as our long line swept on with all our batteries pour-
ing their broadsides forth steady at the controls i
held new york at that colossal lines head holding it
at an even distance from the great circle of the enemy
cities i saw now that our terrific fire as we rushed
past those cities was swiftly in that moment taking
effect upon them even as i gazed amsterdam
vienna cairo and madrid were falling beneath the
awful concentrated fire of our rushing cities and in
our own line buenos aires staggered swayed and fell
as the enemy barked savagely back toward us

  on yamall was crying beside me its our
chance to strike hard at them-before they can bring
the rest of their cities into action

  but theyre doing it now i shouted back to him
cities in the air	

above the thunder of guns the drone of motors and
hissing tube-propellers theyre stringing their circle
out into a line also

  for it was plainly visible upon the great screen be-
side me that the commanders of the enemy were striv-
ing to form their great circle into a line that could meet
our own more effectively in mid-air we saw their
cities rushing inward and changing formation there
beside us but we knew that our change had come and
so hung upon the flank of the great mass of cities our
line rushing along it with all our guns turned toward
it and now though quebec was falling in our line
our guns had sent down copenhagen yokohama and
calcutta in the mass beside us since by now we had
raced past the mass of the european air-cities and our
guns were thundering against the asiatic cities their
guns roared sullenly in answer to us as we flashed past
them but for the moment in their disorganization
in their attempts to reform swiftly from their circle
into a line like our own their fire was seriously ham-
pered by their own movements in that moment we
were pouring a smothering hail of shells upon them
and city upon city was whirling downward in wild
destruction

  then suddenly with a supremely swift effort their
circle had lengthened straightened their confusion of
the moment had vanished and their cities had formed
almost instantly into a long line like our own but
longer than our own we found ourselves in that
moment with our own line parallel in mid-air to theirs
a mixture of european and asiatic cities directly oppo-
site us and then as we raced on they were racing on
with us their own batteries thundering with newly-
released fury as they sought to blast us from the air
beside them i i heard the sharp order of the first air
chief beside me and held new york steady at the head
of our line the two great city-fleets were racing
through the air in a great running fight with every
gun thundering

  directly opposite new york there raced at the head
of their line the mighty air-city of peking third of
the three great air-capitals the two giants were evenly
matched and now at the head of our respective lines
we engaged in a tremendous duel in mid-air a duel
so intense that almost i forgot the fate of the rushing
armadas behind us in all new york about us mighty
fountains of brilliant light and awful heat were flar-
ing with each salvo of heat-shells from the asiatic
capital but at the same time our own gunners were
working their batteries like madmen and we could
see similar giant craters of fusing metal springing into
being over all the vast mass of clustered towers that
was peking far behind in the enemys line raced the
third great air-capital of berlin and we guessed that
it was now from berlin that the movements of all our
foes were being directed but so awful was the battle
that we were undergoing with the asiatic capital oppo-
site us that for the moment we forgot almost all else

  behind us i was dimly aware of all our great line
of air-cities grappling with the line rushing opposite
chicago a little farther back in our line from ourselves
was carrying on as terrific a duel with london con-
stantinople in the enemys line was whirling downward
beneath the batteries of denver and valparaiso mon-
treal in our own was falling in fusing death as it be-
came the target for all the giant batteries of the colossal
city of berlin city after city in the two racing strug-
gling lines was falling to annihilation as the awful battle
raged on high above the colossal lines of racing cities
our own great fleet of cruisers and the enemys were

whirling in a wild fury insane as our own giant battle
of cities surely armageddon had come upon the earth
at last

   although the european and asiatic cities still out-
numbered us we had cut down their great margin
of superiority in that attack which our line had made
upon their confused circle now with equal fury they
were striking from line to line

   straight ahead of our two racing lines there loomed
now a great bank of drifting vapors great cloud-masses
drifting south from the lakes to the north neither
of our two battling lines desired to enter those vapor-
masses and so as one when we neared them both
lines shot downward

surrounded again

down-down-with our batteries thundering still
across the gulf toward peking whose own guns
answered with as great a fury though in their city
as in ours battery after battery was being silenced
down-down-until the green earth beneath lit by the
descending afternoon sun seemed just beneath us rush-
ing up toward us with awful speed as we shot down
to it yet in that dread moment neither line of strug-
gling cities straightened upward each fearful of the
others gaining an advantage in an instant more it
seemed new york must crash together headlong into
the earth

  downward we shot and i saw the green plain loom-
ing awful beneath us at the last moment i jerked
back another of the direction-levers before me and
as in answer to the controls new york tipped sharply
upward once more i saw peking opposite rushing up
at the same instant saving itself as we had done be-
hind us the cities that directly followed in our two lines
were curving up as swiftly all their guns thundering
still as furiously but farther back in the two lines
there were cities that had swooped too low to recover
had dipped lower and in the next moment had crashed
and been annihilated upon the green earth as they
collided with it at their terrific speed

  but while our two lines were whirling upward at
as steep a slant as they had descended the battle seemed
to deepen in furious intensity new york and peking
were stabbing still at each other with all their forces
each colossal city seeming too mighty to be struck
down though each was flaming under a terrible fire
of shells behind us after a running duel that had
achieved almost the magnitude and fully the intensity
of our own chicago had given london the finishing
stroke and that great city was wavering staggering
then slipping and falling in white-hot annihilation
toward the earth and as all along both lines other
cities staggered and fell i saw that above us the two
whirling cruiser-fleets had almost entirely vanished
they had almost entirely annihilated each other by the
insane fury of their attacks

   i felt my brain spinning felt all things about me re-
solving into a wild whirl of thunderous sound and flar-
ing light i heard as though from a great distance the
orders of yarnall beside me and the frenzied voice of
connell sending those orders flashing out from the
distance-phone heard the thunder of guns and sound
of motors and propellers and wild noises that were
coming from all the city about us then before our
two onrushing lines there loomed another great mass
of drifting vapors and again our two lines dipped
downward to avoid those masses but as we shot
downward the line opposite us with peking at its head
shot as quickly upward again in answer to some com-
	air wonder stories

mand it raced on through the vapor-masses instead of
beneath them

  in the next moment we had shot our own line upward
again to race side by side with them still but we were
too late for that moment had given them at their tre-
mendous speed the advantage for which they sought
for in that moment rushing on through the vapor-
masses instead of beneath them they had gained a
little so that when we shot upward again to their level
they were ahead of us as well as beside us and then
their line ahead of us was swiftly curving back and
around our other side as we slowed instantly to
avoid a collision that would annihilate us and all our
mass they swept the end of their longer line around
the rear of our own and thus in the next instant were
forming a complete circle around our cities they had
at last accomplished their great object had managed
to surround our mass of mighty cities outnumbering
us still

  as their circle closed lightning-like about us we three
sat in that moment as though stunned and then from
all the air-cities that encircled us a terrific thunderous
fire was pouring upon us encircled we were a per-
fect target now for all the european and asiatic gun-
ners around us pouring all their mighty broadsides
upon us and now yarnall had leaped to his feet
the tense agony in his eyes reflected in those of connell
and myself in that terrible moment

  theyve got us he was crying hoarsely theyve
got us inside their circle at last-theyre hammering us
to doom

  cant we break out i cried break through this
circle about us 

  he shook his head his eyes burning no-their
circle is complete around us now and wed only crash
our own cities to earth-but well try above and below

  with the words he gave a brief order and as con-
nells voice flashed that order to all our confused mass
of cities they leaped upward in sudden concerted mo-
tion all their motors energy turned suddenly into their
vertical lifting power but as they shot upward thus
to win free of the circle about us that circle lifted at
the same speed as our own mass hovering still around
us and beating us still with all the relentless fire of
their massed batteries and when we shot suddenly
downward in an attempt to escape from below they
sank downward at as quick a speed were encircling
us still and now beneath that awful hammering fire
of all the massed cities that enclosed us our own were
beginning to stagger to sway and reel

  the titanic circle of enemy air-cities about us and
our own great throng of cities each a giant circular
mass of belching flame floating there miles above the
earth the thunder of each citys giant batteries and the
terrific brilliance of the storms of heat-shells that struck
from city to city the great glowing craters of metal
that each striking shell made in a city all these things
seemed merged in the six periscopic screens that en-
closed us like some chaotic and meaningless panorama

  i was aware of yamalls agonized expression as we
strove with every power that was ours to save our great
air-cities from destruction for now in our cluster
city after city was falling beneath that deadly fire of
fusing shells los angeles winnipeg panama and
nashville whirled down one after the other and
though our batteries were still thundering their roar-
ing answers our surrounded cities were still striking
savagely out with the colossal batteries of new york
still thundering loudest i saw how swiftly we were
being annihilated for raging there in fearful battle

high in the dusk between earth and stars there was
left now hardly more than sixty of our hundred air-
cities while in the circle about us there still hung
despite the giant blows we had struck them a hundred
or more of the european and asiatic cities and with
all their guns thundering into us the odds were swiftly
changing and becoming more in their favor 
finally i stood up as though jerked to my feet by
some strange force greater than myself and wheeled
toward the first air chief

    its the end now yarnall i cried to him above that
 thunderous roar of battle that seemed splitting all the
 night about us the end for all our cities within an
 hour if this keeps on

   the end he said his own face grim but theres
 no escape-we can only meet it fighting

   my eyes held his fixedly in that tense moment the
 hundred cruisers in the plaza outside i said the
 cruisers i had you keep waiting for me-that last crazy
 plan of mine is our one chance now

   your plan  he cried a flicker of hope rising into
 his eyes but when i explained that plan in a few
 swift words his eyes widened with sudden stunned
 astonishment and he cried out the things insane
 brant youll never make it

   but its our last chance i shouted to him as the
 thunderous drumming of doom all about us deepened
 and two more of our cities crashed earthward its
 the one last chance to save our cities

   he paused there silent a second then reached wrung
 my hand tightly then go brant he said simply
 take the hundred cruisers-and god grant that you
 are able to do the thing

   i shouted to the black-jacketed attendants who were
 working like madmen around the great rooms instru-
 ment-panels cutting out motors that the heat reached
 switching in spare motors and tube-propellers keeping
 the mighty sustaining power of new york steady two
 of them leaped swiftly at my call to the side of yarnall
 to take the places of connell and myself and then
 macklin and hilliard who had been working with them
 were running toward us also and we four were run-
 ning across the room and through the ante-rooms until
 we issued out from the electrostatic towers base into
 the great plaza

    standing there in that plaza with the darkness gather-
 ing about us there stretched from horizon to horizon
 a boundless mass of gigantic light-gemmed cities our
 own and the titanic ring that encircled us the myriad
 lights of those cities though by which their gun-crews
 worked the great batteries were feeble in comparison
 to the tremendous and blinding flares of brilliance in
 all directions that were fountaining up in giant gouts
 of dazzling light across all those cities floating there
 leaped and flew the heat-shell flares and the thunder
 of the guns was deafening titanic like the thunder of
 a stream of falling worlds beneath that thunder
 there came to us thin high cries the wild cries of
 crowds in the towers of cities and in their streets and

 elazas and high high above all these far far over-
 ead began to gleam the pale mocking eyes of the dis-
 tant watching stars

   all about us in that moment that we burst out onto
 the plaza it seemed that heat-shells were striking and
 flaring but the static-tower itself was of a composi-
 tion that the shells could not harm the rare refractory
 alloy that in air-cities is used only for the vital power-
 towers and though shells had struck here and there
 at the plazas edge and on its surface though there
  were on it and around it still-glowing craters of fusing
cities in the air	

 metal few of the hundred close-massed cruisers that
 waited with their crews upon it had suffered serious
 injury in the awful course of the battle so far and
 now macklin and connell and hilliard and i were racing
 across the plaza toward those cruisers into the fore-
 most of them and up to its bridge-room then macklin
 jumped to the controls as i called an order into the
 distance-phone over the titanic drumming of guns in
 the next moment our hundred cruisers were driving
 up like mad things above the titanic battle raging there
 above

  up-up-through a wild inferno of rushing shells
up over all the struggling thundering reeling cities
we sped on the wild venture that was our last wild
chance as we drove upward i now saw others of our
central mass of air-cities falling atlanta and cleveland
and mexico city were whirling downward giant masses
of lights in which glowed countless great fusing craters
of metal gyrating insanely down through the darkness
to crash in awful destruction on the surface of the
affrighted earth far below hardly more than a half-
hundred indeed remained of all our air-cities now
and the odds against them swiftly lengthened as they
were hammered still upon an anvil of fire and death by
the circle that hemmed them in they were staggering
ever swifter were reeling and swaying so that within
a few minutes even as i had said the remorseless fire
from all about them would send them to earth also and
wipe the last of the cities and peoples of the american
federation from above the earth

  but as i saw that our own cruisers were whirling
on above that giant central mass toward the great
ring of enemy cities about them macklin at the con-
trols with teeth set sent our ship and those behind it
driving low above the awful combat with the storms
of rushing shells from both sides thick about us ship
after ship behind us was flaring and fusing and falling
in white-glowing meteoric destruction unnoticed and
unheeded by any in the titanic thundering battle be-
neath  on-on-we sped rocketing through the night
seemingly the only cruisers now in the air since the
two great fleets had all but annihilated themselves
yet as we shot on it seemed almost that no cruisers
could exist in the air over that great battle since in
dozens in scores our own ships were falling stricken
by the tempests of shells through which we were
rushing

  but now we were reaching our goal the giant berlin
that hung there in the enemys circle with all its mighty
batteries thundering again our doomed cities down
toward it our cruisers swiftly rushed unseen by any in
the wild confusion that swept that city below us down
until we saw plainly the terrific spectacle of thundering
batteries and wildly-rushing men here and there were
heat-shells bursting and flaring in dazzling death as
the guns of our own cities roared savage answer
down toward it moved our ships now hardly more
than a score in number until there loomed just be-
neath us that mighty central static-tower in which we
had been so recently imprisoned as we shot down
toward it i beheld a glass ball above its tip recognized
that as similar in purpose to the periscopic-screens
on our own towers tip and then we had shot down past
it until our score of cruisers hoved beside the great
towers side at the fifth level

  hovering there in that moment beside the tower
with all the wild confusion raging beneath and the
plaza wow still empty we were still unseen by any
beneath by any in the great batteries that were thunder-
ing all around that plaza poised there in the darkness

we could see that the windows beside us were bright-
lighted  that guards were swarming in the static-towers
upper levels rushing to and fro then as our cruisers
door swung open just level with a window beside us
macklin and connell and hilliard and i were springing
forth from that door and across the narrow gap through
that window our heat-pistols ready in our hands and
at the same moment there burst after us our crew
and from all the windows around that level from all
the cruisers hovering beside those windows a stream
of black-uniformed americans with heat-pistols in
hands were pouring into the towers fifth level 

  instantly the guards in that level were snapping their
own weapons up toward us but before they could fire
a score of cartridges from our pistols had flicked and
flared among them as they sank lifeless in scorched
burned heaps of flesh we were racing through the other
rooms and corridors of that level killing the guards
in it with our heat-pistols the surprise of our attack
taking them unawares so awful was the drumming
of the titanic battle all around and outside that no alarm
of our presence penetrated to the levels above and lie-
low us and now with the last of the guards wiped
from that fifth level i turned toward my three com-
panions

  connell and hilliard take half our men and find
your places here in the tower keeping anyone in its
upper levels from getting farther down than this
macklin watch with our cruisers outside-at this low
height the batteries around the plaza cant reach the
ships cant pivot toward you-and be ready to keep
anyone from getting into the tower from outside

  as they whirled to obey my orders with the other
half of our men some hundred and fifty in number
i was running toward the cage-lifts with swift blows
we destroyed the controls that guided them from level
to level of the tower and then we rushed toward the
narrow stairs that led also downward another mo-
ment and we were rushing down those stairs while as
we did so there came a scuffle of battle above us and
we knew that the alarm had penetrated to the upper
floors of the tower and that the guards there were
pouring down to battle with connell and hilliard and
their men we leaped on downward though down
until we had burst down into the fourth level there
our surprise was as complete and before the guards
there were aware of our presence almost we had sent
our heat-cartridges flaring among them had swept them
from existence and were leaping down to the third
level and in that it went the same and in the second
below it and then with hearts pounding we were rush-
ing down into the first level

  as we poured down into its anterooms its guards
rushed toward us and their own heat-pistols came up
but they too were falling in scorched heaps a moment
later and we were dashing through the anterooms
toward the great circular inmost chamber that held the
inmost controls of this great air-city of berlin
through those anterooms we burst the surprised guards
falling lifeless and burnt before us and then into the
inmost circular room all around its panelled walls
moved green-uniformed attendants who whirled with
surprise from their switches and dials at our entrance
while at the rooms center there was what seemed at
first to be a great dull-glass globe we knew that that
globe enclosed within itself the great table-map and
controls of berlin and now there were bursting out
through an opening in that globe the three green-
uniformed men who had been within it-the first air
chief of the european federation and the two officers
air wonder stories



who with him had been controlling the movements of
all the mighty combined european and asiatic cities

the captured city

as the leader saw me his swarthy face lit for a mo-
ment with a flash of recognition of astonishment
and then he and his fellows were leaping toward us
their hands flashing down toward the heat-pistols at
their belts as the attendants around the room jerked
forth their weapons also but as they did so our own
heat-pistols flashed up and for the next instant the
great room seemed full of flares of blinding light as
the cartridges burst among them sending them stag-
gering and swaying and falling in seared heaps i
shouted to my men swift orders that sent a score of
them to the great switch-panels to take the places of
the attendants there while the remainder rushed toward
the great doors that opened from the towers lowest
level into the plaza outside swiftly they closed those
doors barred them and massed behind them and then
i was rushing toward the great dull-glass ball at the
rooms center

  inside that ball stood the great table-map upon its
great block while beside it were the six levers and
speed-knob which controlled the speed and direction
of berlin as i took the seat before them now i gazed
about me and saw that the great balls interior was
in effect a great periscopic screen itself one in which
i could gaze in any direction through the other great
ball above the static-towers tip and now gazing
into it around me there i could see that in the outer
night there stretched still the giant ring of the enemy
cities of which this berlin was the heart surrounding
our own survivors and hammering them still with that
deadly fire which would soon bring them crashing to
earth far out over that mighty field of battle its
brilliant lights and blinding heat-flares stabbing the
darkness and its thunderous roar of guns shaking the
air i could gaze while even at the same moment i
heard high above connell and hilliard and their men
engaged fiercely in holding the guards in the upper
tower back at the same instant came a sudden knock-
ing an alarmed rapping and then a battering and cry-
ing of voices against the great towers door from out-
side as the alarm spread from the towers upper levels

  disregarding all these things i grasped the controls
before me watching the scene all about the great city
through the periscopic ball about me swiftly i jerked
open the speed-knob at the same time slamming down
one of the direction-levers and as i did so i saw that
the whole great city of berlin was soaring up now above
the ring of cities in which it had hovered until it
was a little above their level and then i thrust back
the lever in my hand and jerked down another as i
did so the mighty air-city of berlin the titanic air-
capital whose controls we had captured and which lay
now in my hands was driving sidewise toward geneva
that hung beside it in the ring toward it we sped
driving at top speed toward it at a height a little above
it so that our colossal base was on the level of genevas
upper towers and with set teeth i drove berlin on-
ward and in the next moment its great base had sheared
right across the upper towers of geneva had mowed
down those great towers like blades of wheat before
a reaper

  then as berlin drove on from above it i saw geneva
wavering in mid-air behind us for a moment and then
crashing down to earth through the night i had
mowed away the great electro-static tower whose col-

lection of cosmic energy held it aloft and geneva went
crashing down to earth through the darkness like some
giant comet of blazing lights plunging to doom and
then beneath my hands berlin was driving still on-
ward across and over that great ring of enemy cities
shearing now in the same way across the towers of
city upon city in that ring stockholm and cape town
and bucharest fell as i mowed their power-towers from
them and to them that awful spectacle of berlin rush-
ing upon them and sending them to doom crashing
across their great towers must have been utterly stun-
ning and inexplicable in that wild moment

  on-on-around the great ring i held almost insane
with wild fury and excitement in that moment of tri-
umph driving through the night on our captured air-
city and sending city after city whirling to death i
was dimly aware that the fighting above had ceased
connell and hilliard and their men had wiped out the
guards in the tower above and they had rushed down
to defend the electro-static towers doors against which
a wild battering was resounding now huge crowds
were surging madly against the tower as they felt their
great city rushing through the night and crashing in
wild destruction across their fellow-cities but in
the wild excitement that was surging through me now
i paid no attention to all about me for surely i was
swaying such colossal forces as no man ever had swayed
before

  the european and the asiatic cities were breaking
from me in wild panic disorganized and shattered
since there came now no commands to them from this
city of berlin that had held their commander and
as they broke into a disorganized mass the half-hundred
american cities massed in the center who had seen the
terrible havoc that berlin beneath my hands was wreak-
ing upon their enemies were themselves rushing to
the attack once more and all their guns were thunder-
ing toward the disorganized mass of their enemies

  up toward berlin from that mass as we rushed for-
ward there rose to meet us the giant air-capital of
peking battered scarred its commander seeking to
stay this crazy destruction its sister-capital was wreak-
ing upon their own forces up it came and for an
instant it seemed that berlin and peking must crash
together bodily but with a last wrench of the speed-
control i sent berlin racing higher and then as we
met peking crashed over it that mighty capitals power-
tower also with its other clustered towers was sheared
from it by our great base peking was wavering for
a moment and then went whirling down to death yet
even as it wavered slipped and fell its great guns were
thundering savagely upon us until it had crashed to
earth far below

victory i

and now down through the night upon the mass of
our enemy cities i sent berlin slanting down
toward them at its full speed and across them in a tre-
mendous ramming swoop that sheared the towers from
a dozen of them even as they attempted confusedly to
rise and meet the onthundering mighty city of that
confused disorganized and broken mass there remained
of them at last hardly more than a score still savagely
belching death from their guns toward our half-hundred
american cities and still sending an occasional one
downward but now as i whirled the giant mass of
berlin back toward them like a striking gigantic bird of
prey i was aware of a tremendous battering and clang-
ing of metal and at the same moment hilliard was
shouting to me from the great doors that opened from
qties in

the anterooms into the plaza

  theyre breaking down the doors brant he was
screaming above the wild thunder of battle and the
clamor of giant crowds that surged against those doors
outside fight on though-well try to hold them
back

  hold them a moment longer i yelled back to
him a moment more-

  for now i sent berlin whirling downward in another
terrific swoop across the mass of our enemy cities and
it sheared across half their mass as they sought by
rising or sinking to avoid that deadly swoop but a
half-score were left of them now and now the half-
hundred cities of the american federation had gathered
about them and were hammering them with terrific
fire no gun sounded now on berlin all its crews and
soldiers were rushing wildly across it toward the electro-
static tower as the city whirled and crashed and fought
and ran there against their own allied cities caught in
the terrific fire of the cities around them the half-score
european and asiatic cities were going down with guns
thundering into annihilation but now i was aware
at the same moment of a terrific uproar there at the
towers doors and of wild shouts and clanging blows
there as our men fought to hold back the madly surging
crowds outside

  gripping the levers before me for one last effort

i jerked open the speed-control to its widest and then
as it shot above the mass of the european and asiatic
cities only a half-dozen in number now i whirled the
mighty mass of berlin down upon them in one last
tremendous swoop from which they sought in vain to
swerve they toowere hesitating for a moment and
then went whirling down to death the last of the europ-
ean and asiatic cities save for berlin itself about me
and then as i brought that city to a stay with the last
of its companions crashing beneath and with the ameri-
can cities hanging all about us now there was a great
clang of falling metal at the towers doors and back
through them wild crowds without were pushing our
black-uniformed defenders

  connell and hilliard at their head our men were
being pushed back through the ante-rooms back toward
the great circular room in which i sat at the controls
and as i gazed out through the opening in the great
periscope ball about me i saw that an instant more
would see them overpowering the last of our men rush-
ing in upon me to take the citys controls once more
but as i saw that i reached forward slammed down
the lever that sent the city rushing downward i
gripped that lever and with a supreme effort tore it
completely from its socket the next moment a wilder
cry came from the crowds fighting through the door
and the crowds over all the city outside as they felt
that city whirling and swaying beneath them felt it
whirling down to death through the night to annihi-
lation 

  and as they uttered that tremendous cry as the
swaying city flashed downward their struggle at the
door forgotten in that awful moment of doom i was
aware subconsciously that i was staggering with con-
nell and hilliard and our remaining men up the nar-
row stair up to the great towers second level and
to its windows beside which hung our cruisers with
macklin and a skeleton crew holding them there be-
side the tower even as the great city whirled with awful
speed downward then we jumped through those
windows into the cruisers and the next moment just
as the cruisers with ourselves inside them drove upward
like light from the falling city berlin had crashed into

the air	

the earth just beneath us with a terrific annihilating
shock that buckled it broke it made of it but a great
twisted mass of rended metal 

  then we were driving up toward the half-hundred
remaining american air-cities that hung still high above
the giant city of new york still at their center up
until we had soared above those cities and they lay
beneath us giant circles of brilliant light scarred here
and there with countless craters of fused metal their
great crowds of peoples had surged now from their
towers out into their squares and streets they gazed
as if incredulously stunned by their deliverance at the
empty air and night about them where so shortly be-
fore had hung the enemy that had been sending them
to doom in that moment as we hung there high over
them in that moment of incredible surprise and dawn-
ing joy it seemed that all the world was silent after
the terrific thunder of that wild rushing battle that had
riven earth and sky so short a time before it was
as though the night and the winds about us and the
white stars overhead were as silent with astonishment
in that moment as the crowds on the cities that hung
around and beneath us

  then suddenly from those cities there was com-
ing up toward us as though from a single voice a single
mighty cry

dawnward

at dawn of the next day our half-hundred great
air-cities prepared to separate to move back to
those positions that had been theirs before danger
had brought them together through all of that night
they had hung there together their streets crowded
with weeping yet rejoicing crowds and now that the
dawn showed them the green plains far beneath they
were beginning to depart and we five sitting there
within the periscopic screens in the power-tower of
new york were watching them as they prepared to go

  battered and scarred all of them by that titanic
battle through which all had fought many of them
with great towers fused and broken and scarred with
great craters they were crowding toward us wash-
ington was foremost among them until it hung just
beside our city its great streets and plazas thronged
with shouting crowds and in the wild shouts of those
crowds we could hear our own names their roaring
tribute for in their eyes we had saved them by that
last wild effort of ours and then washington was
moving away from us toward the southeast speeding
away and vanishing as a dark spot in the southeastern
sky

  and now another was crowding beside us and an-
other and still they came pittsburgh and guatemala
tacoma chicago and philadelphia rio de janeiro
kansas city and vancouver-one by one they were
driving beside us their giant bulks hanging beside new
york their mighty cheers reaching us they moved
away to north and south and east and west to vanish
as dark dwindling spots in the skies until new york
alone of them remained hovering there high above the
earth and then yamalls eyes returned to the screen
beneath us where there were revealed the great shat-
tered wrecks laying half-buried in the green earth far
below

  we win he said slowly the american federa-
tion wins but at what cost  two-thirds of the worlds
cities have crashed to annihilation and death and a half
of our own

  its so yarnall i said gazing down with him
yet it was our necessity and not our will they at-
air wonder stories



tacked us without warning attacked us with mighty
weapons which they had devised especially to annihilate
us all-and we could but defend ourselves

 i know it brant he said we could do nothing
 else-but i am glad-glad man-only that this great-
 est of all wars is the last

 earths last air war it was macklin speaking
 thoughtfully now the war lords of our enemies
 have gone their people will join with us to end all wars
 to forget all our enmities   

 we will i said as i turned toward the controls
 but we five can never forget what has happened

 and then as the others sat silent at my words i was

 opening the speed-control before me moving over one
 of the great levers and sending new york with its
 great motors droning and its tube-propellers hissing
 away to the east toward the sunrise faster and faster
 rushing eastward over the green plains that were now
 rolling swiftly back far beneath on all the mighty
 city around us in all its streets and plazas its great
 surging crowds were shouting still a great rejoicing
 clamor but we five there at the citys controls in the
 great tower sat silent and unmoving gazing out into
 the blue cloudless heavens before us as our city rushed
 dawnward we looked into the face of the morning sun
 it was the sun rising on a world at peace

                                 the end

the greatest
interplanetarian story
of all time

  is to our minds

 the shot into infinity

  by otto willi gail

  during the past few years the germans have
progressed rapidly in serious attempts to solve
interplanetarian travel in the present story
by one of the greatest german science fiction
authors mr otto willi gail has given the
world a real story on interplanetarian travel not
based upon the usual fiction but upon real
science

   in writing the story he has had the collabora-
tion of the most famous german scientists-
experts on the subject a most marvelous

flight of the eastern star

continued from page 

in the way of tense gripping thrills in the form of
near catastrophes anti mid-air rescues although i en-
joyed every moment of it and it was with pleasant
memories that i finally entered again the office of my
friend jackson worthington in los angeles he was
as pleased to see me again as i to see him he at once
informed me that i had promenaded some of my
paunch away and that i looked as fit as the pro-
verbial fiddle

  by the way jack i said during the course of our
discussion did captain markson deliver the consign-
ment in peiping on time

  jack laughed pleasantly

  certainly tom he said he piloted the eastern
star himself all the way from tokio to peiping and
arrived well ahead of schedule he held up the ship
an hour and with madden saw personally to the deliv-
ery but somehow reports had reached chinas under-
world that a consignment of bullion would be delivered
to the government at that hour and madden and mark-
son had one helluva time they were raided shortly
after they departed from the anchoring tower in a
machine but leave it to madden to fight his way clear
he got a dirk thrust in the arm and a bullet crease
across his neck but they delivered the goods never-
theless

the

   damn it i exploded and i had to miss all
 that just to watch a few crazy japs showing off in
 airplanes markson wasnt hurt then

   no jack replied markson is the luckiest fellow
 i ever knew he has had a lot of ups-and-downs but
 ive never known him to get up too high or down too
 low hes immune to danger either personal or public
 as for madden hes too modest to tell anyone how he
 got his neck in a sling what a corking good half-
 back hed have made on our old bingham team tom
 madden  i said why jack what he couldnt
 do to those gayle men physically would have been
 made up by one look at him when he scowls the
 world ought to tremble in fright but let me tell you
 hes a he-man to the core-and one of the finest de-
 spite his looks

   yep but our new globe-circumnavigator the
 comet is going to part markson and madden mad-
 den has been elevated to a captaincy and will command
 the eastern star the comet is designed to be the
 finest ship ever built and will slice eight hours off our
 usual round-the-world time you ought to book pas-
 sage on her now tom with markson in command
 of such a ship youre bound to see some excitement
 maybe i will jack maybe i will

   and with that we parted

the phantom of galon

              continued from page 

  you know the rest of the story when i saw your
static supercharger i knew that my days were num-
bered  so i persuaded you to go to europe with a pur-
pose to kill you on the way but my good instincts had
not been completely submerged i could not kill the boy
that i had dandled on my knee when i saw that you
were falling in love with miss huntington i became in-
tensely jealous of her for she might take you from me
the fiend who had plotted your death now wished to
preserve you for himself i decided to kidnap her
without delay but in doing so for the first time in
my criminal life my plans were upset and i barely
escaped with a whole skin thanks to you later how-
ever i successfully accomplished the abduction of your
bride and her servant

  did you kill her too broke in manning at this
point he waited dreading the answer which would
verify the death of the one he loved there was a
breathless pause then herrick spoke again

  no i did not kill her i intended to do so but some-
thing has stayed me

  the sudden relief was too much for manning he
broke down and cried like a child

  while manning was getting his emotions under con-
trol herrick spoke some strange words to the malay
who immediately left the room

  the body which you thought was mine herrick
continued and which lies buried back home was
specially prepared by me for the purpose it was my
wish that richard herrick should drop forever from
the sight of the world just a week ago the demon that
had so long dominated my mind suddenly left me for a
time i realized with horror what i had done then
came your pursuit i tried to stop you by paralyzing
your motors but i did not wish to harm you i wanted
only to escape i have decided to give up confess every-
thing and send you home with your bride

  but what will become of you broke in manning

  herrick laughed coldly

  my doom is sealed the demon has gone for a time
only i am a sane man now but i cannot tell how long
that will last if the devil again possessed me i would
become a raging maniac but that shall never be five
minutes after you leave this ship i will die and my
secret will go with me no trace of this satanic inven-

tion shall remain i have had myself bound to my
chair lest the fit return on me before you escape

  a door opened on the far side of the room and the
huge malay entered followed by margaret huntington
dick she cried and ran into his arms

  when the reunited lovers at last turned from each
other and looked questioningly to the master of the
phantom the latter said

  you two must go now and you will never again
return to galon i wish you all the happiness in the
world you must try to forget richard herrick
there was a pause then he continued will you
bid farewell to an old man who has wronged you
deeply his hand was outstretched there was such
a pitiful note in herricks tone that manning could
hardly keep the tears from blinding him after all
he could not forget what herrick had been to him
we forgive all uncle dick said margaret
herrick smiled you are a wonderful girl mar-
garet he said make richard a good wife
good-by uncle dick said manning huskily
good-by and god bless you both herrick replied
the two slowly walked from the room at the door
manning turned and looked back there sat herrick
looking weak and forlorn but smiling faintly he
raised his hand in a farewell salute and the two young
people passed out into the world of sunshine

  for almost five minutes the two who had been so
joyfully reunited followed the narrow trail which led
toward the skyrocket at length they came to the top
of a hill and looked back there in the clearing they
could see the phantom shining black in the tropical
sunshine suddenly as they watched there burst from
the great craft a cloud of dense brown smoke that rolled
out over the clearing in huge billows a dull rumble
shook the ground and a great explosion reverberated
throygh the air then the smoke began to settle in a
fine brown dust over all the clearing when it had com-
pletely cleared away there were to be seen where the
phantom had rested only an irregular crater and shat-
tered fragments richard herrick was at last truly
dead and the phantom of galon was no more

  manning sighed wiped a tear from his eyes and
taking the hand of his bride in his own led her down
the other side of the hill to a new day and a new life

freedom of the skies

            continued from page 

  you have learned how many of these to each plane
will make it capable of destroying a city he asked

  fred nodded issue each pilot five of those tablets
he directed the grand master nodded to the orderly
who hurriedly seized the carton which had contained
the gold and departed on his mission the grand
master continued to smile

  now said he the other package is for your own
use on the great mission let me see its contents
brettner opened a smaller package and revealed a
layer of white tablets each about the size of a pea lying
amid wrappers of cotton wool

  you will retain these for your own use the grand
master said you will rest for two hours after which
you are to depart in our fastest plane to the capital of
the greatest nation in the world-he spoke ironically-
and destroy it

  fred winced does that constitute the great mis-
sion he asked

  the grand master nodded indeed and until you
have destroyed washington completely and returned
here you shall not see your nalia she is safe now
but unless you carry out this mission in good faith and
return here you shall never see her again and-and
she shall die a horrible death

  fred parleyed for time is there no way out of this
-cannot we take this city without destroying not only
the government of the united states but all the people
who live there 

  the grand masters eyes blazed none he said
firmly it is your mission to end their lives the
leaders of the nation must be killed to demoralize it
blow the city to the four winds and make yourself one
of the greatest conquerors of all time 

  fred bowed his head obediently

  go then said the ruler

  before i go fred whispered i have some infor-
mation for you which i can give you only in the utmost
privacy he looked significantly toward the brawny
bodyguard of the grand master standing at the door
through which brettner had come the grand master
looked surprised he pondered for a moment then-
granted he snapped he turned to his guard

  see that we are not disturbed until i ring for you
said the grand master

  the guard bowed and walked out

  when they were alone the grand master turned to
fred what he saw made his face turn a ghastly white
brettner held the radium-ray pistol in his hand pointed
toward the potentate his hand went out for the bell-
button but freds voice stayed him one move means
death mr grand master i will teach you that one man
cannot control the world if that can be done im the
man from now on you are to do as i say

  you may die any minute said the grand master
his face pale but still smiling

  no bluff fred barked you will die first one
overt move and you die instantly

  well

  call in an orderly and tell him to release miss
nadia deneen and bring her here if she is already
dead god help you

  the grand master pushed the button on the desk
fred was watching him carefully his keen eyes alert

the

 as the orderly came in fred stood in a position which
 concealed the gun while the grand master ordered
 the man to bring nadia to the office when he had gone
 fred gave further orders

   there was a tense ten minutes of waiting before she
 came her face terror-stricken she stood staring be-
 tween the two men with a smile brettner waited for
 the grand master to give his other orders to the
 henchman

   have all planes take off with the explosives and
 cover all the cities the master said then return to
 accompany this lady to a plane and see that it is one
 airworthy for a cruise ashore

   nadias eyes leaped with understanding with a
 loving look at fred she ran toward him when the
 orderly had disappeared brettner snapped at the grand
 master get over there in the corner traitor to hu-
 manity stand where i can keep my eyes upon you
 and still kiss this young lady i

   nadia then saw what had happened she flew into
 freds arms you wont suffer any longer darling
 he assured her ive just conquered the conquerors
 of the world

she held him close while he kept free his right hand
holding the radium-ray pistol pointed at the grand
master the latter at last realizing his position de-
manded what are you going to do now captain 
fred grinned and walked closer

   i am going to send miss nadia ashore for the help
 of the air service who shall hand you over to the arms
 of justice true justice for you would mean the torture
 of waiting days until you should enter a disintegration
 room such as you invented for the destruction of inno-
 cent men but as it is you will get your deserts then

 i	shall retire from the air and become-maybe a grower
 of flowers which i shall use to brighten the light and
 love of my life

   the grand master interrupted have you thought
 of all those planes of destruction captain which you
 just dispatched to the greatest cities in the world he
 said laughing madly

   nadia gave a start fred smiled as he told her of
 the terrific explosives and how he had sent those planes
 of destruction out to deal their worst

   nadia was amazed and terrified that this could be
 true but now she trusted him

   have they-have they departed  she asked breath-
 lessly

   freds face suddenly became solemn the grand
 master continued to laugh madly aha splendid
 captain he said you are also an outlaw i could
 not have done better myself your best move at present
 is to remain here and take over my great program i
 nadia was persistent have they gone-to-to kill
 people-all over the country she asked

   freds face was solemn

   yes theyve gone he said theyve gone to fly
 over the greatest cities in the world he turned to the
 grand master then and his face broke into a smile

but just think of all your planes dropping aspirin
tablets over the country like a fleet of advertisers and
no one with the sign of a headache youre a fine con-
queror you have the whole world in your power eh
he would have gone on but nadia was kissing him

beryllium foreseen as aircraft
metal

a prediction ol dr w h gillcm di-
rector of the battclle memorial institute
columbus ohio that beryllium a light metal
now worth  a pound is likely to find com-
mercial utilization in future aircraft construc-
tion is contained in science service beryllium
js now in the rare metal class but becausc of
its light weight-a third that of aluminum-it
would considerably decrease the weight of air-
craft it is estimated by designers that it is
worth forty dollars to roaucc the weight of an
airplane one pound dr gilictt declares how-
ever that although beryllium is so expensive
to-day if there were a demand for it it could
be obtained in quantity at a price of about 
to  a pound geologists estimate that there
is as much beryllium by weight in the earths
crust as lead or zinc and much more by volume
because of its present high cost little is known
as to its case in fabrication and endurance it
is known to have a higher modulus of elasticity
than other light metals and this property nearly
equal that of steel promises to allow aircraft
designers to use methods of construction not
now possible it would be well dr gilictt
declared for aircraft manufacturers to investi-
gate the possibilities of this metal

 miles an hour with -ton
planes predicted

igor sikorsky aircraft builder and de-
signer has predicted that in a few years we
will see giant air liners weighing  or 
tons with a carrying capacity of  persons
that there will be a regular thirty-six hour
trans-atlantic transport servicc and that planes
will be able to attain a speed of from  to
 miles an hour at an altitude of  miles
mr sikorsky states that the sole reason huge
air liners do not exist to-day is the reluctance
to invest so much capital in a single flying unit
the wings of the planes will carry the bulk
of the passengers on the future liner be sa-s
and each will will be capable of accommodating
fifty persons there will be no danger of flying
such planes blind through storm and fog as
flying will be guided by the use of instruments
and the great driving power of thousand horse-
power motors will reduce the hazard mr
sikorsky bases his opinion of attaining a speed
of  miles an hour on professor einsteins
theory that if planes fly at an altitude of s
miles they will be m the stratosphere where
the air is so rarefied that it has no retarding
ct on the progress of the plane by her-
ly scaling both the passenger and engine
rtincnts and artificially maintaining normal
iure it will be possible to rcach this

new york may have central
air terminal

a survey has been made of the metro-
politan district of new york from an air-
plane by w j l banham president of the
new york board of trade with a view to
choosing a suitable site for a grand  central
air terminal the locations most satisfactory
are governors island the west bank of the
hudson or the bronx the site of such a
terminal should be convenient to the important
city transportation lines hotels railroad sta-
tions and the shipping district mr banham
stated he predicted that the city will have
union airport terminals union steamship ter-
minals and union railroad terminals the
steamship companies would never have obtained
control of the new york waterfront he said
had the leaders of a decade or two ago foreseen
the development of the city

work on ocean landing plat-
forms progressing

the work on the first of what may be a
series of ocean landing stations for airplanes
is now progressing rapidly this platform will
be anchored to the floor of the atlantic between
new york and bermuda the united states
hydrographic ship hannibal some weeks ago
made a survey between new york and bermuda
and confirmed a report of a new elevation on the
atlantic floor the plateau is about four miles
square and  feet above the surrounding
ocean bed it provides a surface of clay that
would afford good anchorage for the seadrome
if the plan is adopted for the construction of
a series of trans-atlantic seadromes ocean-
ography will have to be delved into further and
new surveys made to ascertain the most suit-
able locations for the placing of the platforms

tin bubble has successful
flight

another stride forward has been made in
lighter-than-air aeronautics by hte success-
ful cross-country trip from detroit to lakehurst
n j of tbe all-metal dirigible zmc- at an
average speed of forty miles an bour captain
william kepner usa was its pilot a new
composition of plates called aldad  having a
base of duralumin coated with a thin layer of
nickel steel is used in the construction of this
shin two wright whirlwind motors are used
and the ship has a capacity of  cubic feet
of helium gas it was built as an experiment
for the united states navy and as this is the
first successful flight of a craft of its kind it
may be the precursor of larger dirigibles made
of the same material it has a cruising range
of  miles and can carry a crew of four
with  pounds of provisions or ammunition

floating airship will assure
safe travel

 an airship capable of floating in the water
 and docked like an ocean liner is the plan
 described in a new book by commander sir
 charles burney builder of tbe r- ever
 since be began the construction of this latter
 airship be has been experimenting with tbe
 possibility of a floating dirigible and he believes
 that when such a one is constructed it will
 revolutionize the future of long-distance air
 travel he has called the proposed sea going
 dirigible the elliptical ship as its cross sec-
 tions are dliptically shaped instead of circular
 as in the present airship beneath tbe hull
 which will be built on ships lines will be two
 huge pontoons as far apart as is possible these
 will scoop up water for ballast and keep the
 ship floating until the passengers disembark on
 small boats commander burney is of the
 opinion that the present system of mooring
 roasts at land stations is not satisfactory it
 leaves the airship at the mercy of sudden gusts
 of wind he suggests a land docking raft
 consisting of a telcscoriic mooring mast mounted
 at the end of a platform whicn is pivoted at
 the end of a raif-rack leading to tbe hangar
 vertical arms on either side of the platform
 will hold the airship firmly and the whole
 structure including tne mooring mast can be
 swung like a turntable until it points to the
 hangar and run into the shed safely

-passenger airship to be built
by burney

-ommander sir charles burney
-who is building the great british dirigible
r- is now working on plans for a new ship
that would carry  passengers besides a suit-
able crew he says that even the r- though
not yet fully completed is already obsolete
and that if he had had his way it would never
have been built ships much larger than the
r- or the graf zeppelin must be built to
make trans-oceanic air transportation practicable
the air ministry however is of the belief
that tbe present ships tbe r- and r-
must be proved practicable before larger vessels
arc constructed the new ship would have a
single large hull in which everything would be
contained instead of separate gondolas for the
engines the envelope would be more stream-
lined and the hull would extend the whole
length of the underpinning

new hangar to be largest in the
world

 akron ohio is to have the largest hangar
 in the world designed for the goodyear-
 zeppelin corporation and now under construc-
 tion which will be used for the assembling of
 two super-dirigibles being built for the u s
 navy and will house them when completed
 the sides of the hangar arc to slope and the top
 will be arched while the general appearance
 will be that of an enormous cocoon cut in half
 it is thus fashioned to present the least amount
 of resistance to the wind according to tbe archi-
 tect wilbur j watson it will be  feet
 long or half as long again as the hangar at
 lakehurst  feet wide and  v feet high
 the round doors of the hangar will probably
 be the most unusual feature of the building
 according to mr watson they are supported
 on forty forged-steel double-flanged wheels
 twenty-seven inches in diameter and run on
 two rails weighing  pounds per yard each
 the wheels are mounted on bearing boxes and
 rest against heavy springs which will permit
 of the equal distribution of the weight tbe
 doors are operated by electric motors and can
 move at from twenty to forty feet per minute

miniature models of planes
used in tournaments

 anew kind of airplane derby has been
 originated in this derby the contestant
 are boys and girls and the machines arc minia-
 ture planes that look and fly like the original
 thing young america has become greatly
 enthusiastic about aviation and the parks and
 playgrounds are full of youngsters constructing
 novel and ingenious planes which they fly with
 great dexterity clubs are being formed by
 them and boston alone has  model aero clubs
 with aa total membership of  aircraft
 clubs in detroit made  model planea in
 seven months cities of the united states and
 canada are constructing model aircraft build-
 ings through local playground and recreation
 departments the stint of st louis has been
 a very popular model for most youngsters an-
 other form of plane is one using skyrockets as
 means of propulsion following the idea of fritz
 von ooel one plane is said to have remained
 aloft for seven and one-fifth seconds employing
 metal tanks equipped with pistons as motivo
 power

    girls too seem to be taking interest in this
  sport and miss amelia earhart noted trans-
 atlantic flyer is reputed to have ssid that some
 of them prove better carpenters than cooks

air wonder stories



two parachutes used

the advisability of aviator having two para-
chutes strapped to them is voiced by c b
mien in tke new york world by such a
practice many casualties might be avoided this
is especially true of stunt or exhibition
jumpers the army and navy for some time
have required that a double parachute be car-
ried by iheir exhibition jumpers one strapped
to the back and the other to the chest an
incident cited to prove the utility of this plan
as a safeguard to flyers occurred at the 
national air races at philadelphia when an ex-
hibition jumper after a delay in releasing the
cord for a delay opening effect found his
parachute ripped from rim to crown and he
had to have recourse to the emergency one
to bring him safely to earth

flight made solely by
instruments

taking off from the pound making a
short flight and again landing very dose
to a marked spot on the ground lieutenant
james h doolittle while working under the
auspices of the guggenheim fund made a suc-
cessful test of flying solely by instruments at
mitchel field new york inis flight in the
opinion of harry f guggenheim president of
the fund marks the end of the terrible fog
menace doolittle was in a fully-enclosed cock-
pit unable to see anything of the outside world
in place of the natural horizon to guide biro
he nad in his plane an artificial horizon a
small instrument which indicated the longi-
tudinal and lateral attitude of the plane with
reference to the ground with stability assured
he was able to locate the landing held by a
direction-finding radio receiver in addition to
the usual long-distance beacon there is also at
the field an auxiliary beacon to enable pilote
within is or  miles of the field to find their
way to it mr guggenheim believes that with
these and other devices that were used for the
first time the weather hazard will vanish and
in fact the plane will be more independent of
weather than any other form of transportation

lightning doubted as menace to
aviation

that lightning is a menace to aviation it
now a question of dispute it is stated that
there has been no decisive proof that airplanes
destroyed by fire during thunderstorms have
been struck by lightning many other causes
might bring these disasters about according
tb dr joseph e woodman professor of
geology and lecturer on aeronautical engineering
at new york university investigation has
shown that the plane in which the mexican
flyer carranza was killed was destroyed when
he attempted to land during the storm and
crashed-into a tree if a pilot could be found
to sayt positively that his plane bad been hit by
lightning prof woodman says then matters
would be different a body must be heavily
charged with electricity for lightning to strike
it those who hold that lightning strikes a
plane do so on the assumption that the plane
gets charred in flight by accumulation of
charges but this has never been proved on
the other hand professor william jackson hum-
phreys of the weather bureau washington
asserts that the danger of an airplane being
struck by lightning is  times as great in the
air as when on ground

new epoch of air transporta-
tion predicted

considering the successes scored by both
vj airplane and dirigible it is clear that we
stand at the threshold of a new epoch of trans-
portation says t j c martyn in the new
york times it is also clear that dirigible and
airplane are to be pitted against each other for
supremacy and it is possible that they may de-
velop into complements of each other diesel-
type engines or possibly modified oil turbines
are being considered for use for airplane pro-
pulsion indications are that moving wings will
make possible vertical ascent or descent it is
not likely according to mr martyn that the
airplane will be able to carry the pay loads of
a dirigible on the other hand the dirigible
can never expect to attain the speed of an
airplane the dirigible will always have a

greater flying range than the airplane and will
 more spacious and luxurious but the faster
speed of the plane will permit it to outride a
storm faster than the dirigible and to land more
readily a dirigible is apt to become helpless
in a bad windstorm but in the case of engine
trouble it is much safer than a plane which
mutt land whereas the airship may remain aloft
until repairs have been effected the writer
prdicts an airship that will be as luxurious
and as well appointed as a steamship

operation-

airplane speed to be doubled
in ten years

louis bleriot the first man to fly across
the english channel predicted recently
that within the next ten years it will be pos-
sible to attain a speed of  miles an hour by
airplane he recalled that when he flew
across the channel his speed was  kilometers
 miles an hour whereas to day the speed
of nearly  kilometers per hour has been
reached on such progress he said we may
base an expectation that to-days speed will be
doubled in the coming ten years he expects
to offer a bleriot cup tor speed contests between
land planes just as the schneider cup is for
seaplanes

tandem-winged monoplane has
successful flight

a successful test flight of the tandem-
winged monoplane built by the fernic air-
craft company of staten island was made with
george fernic its inventor at the controls it
stayed aloft for twenty-two minutes with a
gross weight of more than  pounds and
attained an altitude of  feet it descended
with a new type of three-point landing the
three points being the contacts of the three
wheels with the tail high in the air and the
plane in flying position ready to take off again
it is said to be impossible to stall it in the
air although the test did not take in this phase
of its design the plane has a carrying
capacity of  pounds and has two wright
whirlwind motors of  horsepower each it
has a cruising radius of  miles and a speed
in excess of  miles per hour the plane is
scheduled for a non-stop flight to roumania
fernics native land

experimenters work on flying
wing

german airplane constructor are evolving
a new kind of airplane which will have
no tail rudders elevator planes nor the long
fuselage that bouses the cabin  one of these
planes built by the rhon-rositten company
and equipped with an engine of less than 
horsepower recently made a successful flight
and attained a speed of over  miles per hour
movable surfaces both vertical and horizontal
at the ends of the wings stabilize and steer
the craft and permit the pilot to make it
climb or glide downward at his will the plane
is propelled from behind and the main ad-
vantage of the plane will be the reduction in
air resistance due to the absence of the fuselage
and tail designers are also experimenting
with a flying-wing type of plane this plane
wjll consist of a wing structure only which
will contain the engines pilots seat passengers
and all essential machinery and this it is
hoped will greatly lessen air resistance a
factor which will have to be solved in connec-
tion with this type of plane is whether it is
better to have the propellers in front of the
wing or behind it both positions have ad-
vantages and disadvantages propellers placed
in the rear of the winrs have nothing to ob-
struct their slip-streams but on the other hand
will have to do tbeir work in disturbcd air
because of the wing in front and away from the
leading edge to give proper efficiency in opera-
tion this will mean that they will have to
be mounted on extension shafts or the en-
gines mounted forward of the leading edge in
special nacelles this too like having the pro-
pellers in the rear is not an ideal arrangement

bell telephone has flying
radio laboratory

the largest and most complete radio labora-
tory in the world is now in use by the beu
telephone laboratories this is a ford tri-
motored all-metal plane and will be used for
the development of radio apparatus for air-
craft communication from the earliest experi-
mental stages through to the final testing of the
finished apparatus under actual flight condition
the plane has been equipped with two large
laboratory benches and a number of antennae
it will have two trailing-wire antennae and two
stream-line vertical-rod antennae supports also
have been erected on the wing tips for the
mounting of various types of experimental an-
tennae generators and storage batteries will
supply the power

catapult practical method of
launching planes from city
roofs

a practical way of launching airplanes
from the restricted areas of city roofs is
suggested by lieut j j chirk usn in
the new york times the principle is bor-
rowed from earlier modes of warfare and has

 roved its practicability in the navy since its
rst test in  the plane is shot into flight
by a catapult from its rush down a sixty-foot
track it can attain a speed of sixty miles an
hour in one and a half seconds this method
of launching airplanes is entirely safe he uys
and to date there has been no fatal accident
through its use in the navy the only fatality
on record was when a land plane took off in
the wake of another and was hurled over the
side by the air blast from the leading plane
plane operations from roofs of bouses would
be even more simple than from carrier decks of
a battleship most buildings are sufficiently
strong to withstand the blows of airplane land-
ings ne says because of the rubber-tired wheels
of the planes and the shock absorbers used
future construction of buildings could provide
for the additional weight of a roof airport

european airdromes praised

ajor clarence m young who is

avi to be assistant secretary of commerce for
aeronautics praises the uniformity of airport
rules in europe at croydon tbe airport in-
cluding buildings and equipment is owned and
controlled by the british air ministry the
direct administration of the airport is under an
airport director or chief airdrome officer the
buildings including administration hangars
shops etc were constructed by the air ministry
and the space in them is leased to the various
companies operating from tbe aiiport five
different airlines operate from the croydon air-
drome each arriving planet whether running
on schedule or not must taxi to a platform or
tarmac and report in departing planes must
also taxi from the platform and await a signal
from the tower before taking off croydon
le bourget and tempelhof airdromes being
adherents to the international convention of
air navigation abide by the regulations
adopted at tbe convention and planes approach-
ing these airdromes must follow a uniform pro-
cedure of landing such as circling tbe airdrome
to the left before coming in and if two
planes are ready to land at the same time the
one flying at tbe higher altitude must maneuver
to avoid the other

air corps has new parachute

a revolutionary type of parachute
that may ultimately lake the place of the
standard one now in use has been developed by
tbe army air corps at the experimental labora-
tories at wright field dayton after more
than a years research

though the materials general size and prin-
ciple o operation of the present-day flyer s
umbrella are utilized tbe newcomer has a dif-
ferent kind of mainsail with far more sta-
bility and safety of operation and a unique
type of pilot chute

instead of the circular mainsail there has
been substituted a triangular one with two
corners rounded and the third sheared straight
across tbe shroud lines extend down spaced
regularly as in the standard chute except
across the sheared-off comer which has no
shroud lines at all the result is that when
the parachute is open this corner forms a tail-
like vent through which the air escapes

more than a dozen jumps and a hundred
dummy drops have been made with the new
chnte these indicate a decreased oscillation
and shock to the jumper at the time of open-
ing besides greater steerability in descent
this improved operation is accomplished mainly
by the new mainsail tbe air escaping through
the tail-like vent propels the chute horizontally
at a speed of from three to four miles an hour

investors warned against avia-
tion swindles

a note of warning is sounded by the better
business bureau to prospective students of
aeronautics as well as to investors in stocks of
companies organized for fake aviation promo-
tions it is estimated that millions have been
lost already by investors in swindles of this
nature it is stated that according to govern-
ment authorities it costs about  for the
ordinarily trained young man to become a trans-
port pilot many of the aviation schools lure
students with promises of a job after a few
brief lessons and perhaps ten to twenty hours
of solo flying fifty hours of flying are re-
quired for even a limited commercial license
and  hours are required for a transport
license in fact moat large companies demand
from  to  hours of solo flying before
hiring a pilot therefore the suggestion is
offered to those interested in taking up a course
in aviation that they thoroughly investigate the
school they expect to attend likewise investors
in aviation stocks should use extreme caution
in their investments although without a doubt
substantial earnings may be expected to accrue
from investment in legitimate aviation enter-
prises

altering the risers or changing the chills when
molding the defects may also be remedied by
changing the corc or the pattern from which
the casting is made the study of the shadow-

in speed over any other form of transportation
even at its present stage of development it
can carry a number of passengers at a speed
of  miles an hour in the matter of con-
struction and maintenance of an airway the

preference given american-
built planes in foreign
countries

foreign countries seem to show a prefer-
ence to american-built planes according to
officials of the ryan aircraft corporation a
unit of the detroit aircraft corporation this
is because of the superiority of construction of
the american plane and their simplicity which
permits them to be set up piloted and serviced

by comparatively inexperienced pilots and me-
chanics another consideration is the reputa-
tion of american manufacturers for fair-dealing
and the american system of standardization
which allows parts and replacements to be
shipped with the assurance that they will be
perfectly interchangeable in the last eighteen
months the ryan corporation alone has sold 
ryan broughams in foreign countries including
china mexico guatemala canada argentina
and some european and south american coun-
tries it is an interesting fact that those coun-
tries incapable of manufacturing their own
airplanes are turning to american-built planes
despite certain trade barriers and pricc and
credit concessions offered by manufacturers to
other countries

hasten slowly polioy to be
adopted by aviation
industry

there is something of a lull in the aviation
industry and manufacturing plants are cur-
tailing their production according to the nett
york world this is a wise policy inasmuch
as there has hitherto been too much of the over-
confidence and optimism that usually goes with
a new and growing industry this lull is not
simply a matter of overproduction but an
attempt to have the industry row normally
without trying to force it too much the amer-
ican public according to the world is by no
means air-minded at the present time and
the averaee person cannot simply consider the
millions of miles flown without accident as suf-
ficient reason to change his ideas regarding the
laws of gravity ingrained in him for countless
generations it will take years and the arrival
bf a new generation before the public will
consider that the atmosphere is a real substance
like water and earth and capable of supporting
tremendous weight aviation methods change
rapidly and the present type of engine and ships
are apt to be changed at any time by revolu-
tionary discoveries in the art of flying

rockets

moon rocket in forefront of
german experiments

the question of building a rocket that can
penetrate into outer space and possibly to
the moon is holding the attention ot scientific
circles in germany according to guido enderis
in the new york timet with men such as
professor hermann obcrth max valier and
fritr von opel experimenting with the possi-
bilities of the rocket much is expected to de-
velop professor oberth who has been working
on the rocket principle for many years is now
having his experiments financed by the ufa
film company of germany this company
which has made many pictures of future scien-
tific accomplishment is now making one called
the girl in the moon and the girl uses a
rocket ship developed by professor oberth the
professor however ia cautious in making state-
ments about bis pet be calls the moon rocket
still a dream being apparently content to
build a ship that can attain an altitude of thirty
miles and have it return to a designated spot
the first teats of his development are expccted
to be made on the north sea coast in the near
future

opel makes flight in rocket
plane

the first successful flight of a rocket piano
was made recently in germany by fritz von
opel manufacturer and sportsman who flew
a milo and a quarter in precisely seventy-five
seconds at an average altitude of  feet the
plane a combination of rocket ship and glider
weighed about  pounds when fully loaded
with the rocketa and carrying the pilot after
two unsuccessful attempts to get his ignition
system to explode the rocketa properly opel
essayed again be was shot along a track on
which the machine rested and then catapulted
into the air at a speed of about  miles an
hour three rockets each weighing ten pounds
were used to shoot him off the ground cch
rocket burning for exactly two seconds the
rockets which carried him through the air
burned for twenty-five seconds each generating

o	total lifting power of  pounds the
speed is regulated by the frequency with which
the rockets are touched off after all of them
are exhausted the plane can glide to earth
opel states that he not only expects to build
bigger and better rocket planes as this effort
was only a crude experiment but also intends
to nse the rocket principle on regular planes
both to give them power to take off from the
ground and to serve as a brake when landing
he expects soon to cross the english channel
in a rocket plane opel is also the builder of
a rocket-propelled motor car with which he
attained a speed of  miles an hour eight
seconds after starting

rocket proposed a mail carrier

a space rocket has been designed by pro-
fessor hermann obertb austro-german
scientist to shoot upward for thirty-two miles
the purpose of this first flight will be to
measure the physical and chemical  properties
of the atmosphere the ultimate idea is to
construct a rocket that will carry mail from
germany to the united states in about thirty
minutes the ufa film company is super-
vising the building of the rocket which will
be fired from a ship in the north sea to obviate
the possibility of uamare the propellant will
be liauid air the mail rocket if constructed
would have automatic steering apparatus and a
parachute to permit its  slow descent to earth
when it reached its deatination

matical studies were made on the same problem

sprof max valier of munich and albert
ueller the results of the latter were made
available to the opel companys engineers

   some years ago prof goddard startled the
scientific world by publishing data showing the
possibility of a rocket flight to the moon these
researches have been continued by him aince
then under the auspices of the smithsonian in-
stitution his rocket be figured could travel
at a speed of  miles a second nearly 
miles an hour this speed would be sufficient
to allow it to escape from the earths gravita-
tional attraction and to take it to the moon in
eleven hours his idea waa that the rocket
would not carry a passenger but would bear a
charge of flash powder to explode upon impact
at the moons surface this great flash could
then be observed through earthly telescopes

rocket airplane heralds suc-
cessful space voyaging

voyages through space from earth to the
moon or to other planets are forecast by
the recent successful demonstration in frankfort
of a rocket-propelled airplane in may 
fritz von opel german automobile manufac-
turer demonstrated his rocket automobile now
after fufrther experiments he has built an
airplane propelled by the same means and
shown that it ia capable of flight
interesting as the method is there is little
likelihood that it will ever become a serious
competitor of combustion engines in terrestrial
vehicles or airplanes for use in the lower por-
tions of the atmosphere says science sertrice
the rocket depends for  its propulsion  on the
kick given by the explosions it uses its fuel
whether gasoline hydrogen and oxygen or ex-
plosives very rapidly but only a small amount
of the fuels total energy is available to furnish
the necessary kick in other words the
rocket has a low efficiency where the same
fuej can be used to apply energy to the ground
as in the automobile or to the air as with the
airplane it is better to use the wheel or pro-
peller to obtain traction

in getting through the space between the
planets containing thinner air than the
vacuum of  an incandescent lamp however
the situation is verjr different there no air
ground or water against which to push is avail-
able and the rocket isthe only known means
of propulsion the kick of an explosion is
just as powerful in a vacuum as in the air
for the push is against the gases formed by
the explosion in fact in a vacuum the rocket
would tend to travel somewhat faster because
of the lack of atmospheric resistance

the theoretical investigations upon the prac-
tical uses of the rocket were begun by prof
r h goddard american physicist at clark
university worcester mass later matbe-

 a rocket to the moon not

impractical

professor robert h goddard
writing in the new york sunday world
expressed his firm belief that rocket flight to
the moon and other planets will one day be
an accomplished fact he states that the whole
subject of rocket flying is a legitimate branch
of speculative physics and is convinced that
there is a solution for every problem involved
even to the matter of a return trip from the
moon from  to  professor goddard
conducted experiments at clark university with
rockets shooting smokeless powder through
nozcles in an attempt to secure high speed
and speeds as hieh as  feet per second
were obtained which figure has never been
equaled by any other worker on the subject
professor goddards experiments are now being
financed by the smithsonian institution chiefly
to study conditions in the upper atmospheres
direct measurements of conditions in tne air
have been made to a height only of twenty
miles and were accomplished by instruments
suspended from balloons the balloon and the
airplane cannot pass into the upper regions of
the earths atmosphere as there is not enough
air to support them the rocket is the only
means ot exploration by sendinga rockets
equipped with instruments into the air simul-
taneously at different parts of the country high-
altitude weather maps could be obtained a
practicable rocket professor goddard believes
should consist almost entirely of propellant with
very little actual rocket before interplanetary
travel could be started however it would be
essential to have a comprehensive study of the
nature of the earths atmosphere he scores
as a fallacy the statement that the terrific
forces in the acceleration of a rocket would
destroy a human being as well as delicate in-
struments tests have proved his contention

why not a motor under the
wings

editor aviation forum

  i have read your air wonder stomes of
september and would like to know why tbe
idea of lowell ii morrow in bis air terror
of having the motor under the wings is not
used

                 fred bolte
detroit mich
a great many ideas that are fine from a
general scientific standpoint do not work tech-
nically the business of tbe scientist is to
outline general laws of nature and to indicate
a possib- application for them it is the job
of the engineer to design and actually build
the machine and to weigh its advantages and
disadvantages in practice as we see ft the
idea of mr morrow might be scientifically
feasible but from a technical or engineering
standpoint we believe that tbe stability added
to a plane would be offset by tbe great loss in

rver the analogy of a plane with a bird
somewhat fallacious for a birds power plant

  neutronium is not known to be an actual
substance in existence it is a possible sub-
stance that will come into existence under cer-
tain conditions it has long been recognized
that even tbe most dense of our elements are
relatively porous substances between the elec-
trons and even between atoms there exist empty
spaces thousands of times greater in volume
tnan the bits of material now tt is believed
and calculated that if the empty spaccs between
the atoms could be filled with substance then a
-material which would weigh  pounds
per cubic inch would result this hypothetical
substance is known as neutronium it would
be so heavy that the earths crust could not
support it as yet no such substance has been
made-editor

higher altitudes by gear shift

editor aviation fomin	

   is it possible by adding a gear shift and
can a gear shift be made light enough to raise
a plane higher by speeding the prop faster
than the engiue in higher altitudes and the
consequent thinner air if the difficulty is in
arranging the gear shaft or its weight would
it be likely to lift the plane to a sufficiently
greater height if not why not

   the ideal arrangement for serials is one serial
r issue and no serial unless exceptionally
me to run in three issues in four issues

             jerry noonan
             co apache inn

the valley ranch new mexico

   what is proposed here might be scientifically
feasible although it is to be doubted that it is
technically possible or that it will solve the
problem that confronts altitude seekers there
is no doubt that one of the difficulties encoun-
tered at high altitudes is the obtaining of a
sufficient tractive effect on the thin air this
might be obtained by speeding up the propeller
but there are several disadvantages the first
is that propellers are already operated at high
speeds and it is to be doubted whether they
can stand the increase in speed necessary to
obtain the added lifting effect desired the
second point is that what is really necessary
is to obtain more instantaneous traction on the
air instead of merely speeding it up in other
words by adding more propellers more air
would be cut at the same time and thus give
a greater lifting effect but the greatest prob-
lem that confronts the designers is that of
obtaining more power from the engines at high
altitudes the rarefaction of the air does not
provide oxygen in sufficient quantities for the
engine superchargers bave been resorted to
and so far they bave been fairly successful
these pump in air faster and thus make up for
the deficiency in the atmosphere but mr
noonan roust not think that by speeding up
the propellerhe will obtain more power he
will merely divide the power between a greater
number of revolutions from a theoretical
standpoint however bis idea is very inter
esting and we should like to see mr noonan
develop it further-editor

                    billie finch

an explanation must be made in the ques-
tion asked here on the matter of invisibility
there is no absolute invisibility an object
that exists can be seen but it may not be seen
by u therefore to our eyes it is invisible
now ip the story the raiders invisibility was
neutralized by tbe professors equipment and to
those using the equipment they were no longer
invisible by other persons however the
raiders could not be seen

   tbe invisibility of the raiders would have ab-
 solutely no effect on tbe jupiter one way or
 another however if the raiders had turned
 their invisibility apparatus on the jupiter then
 it might have been a different story we hope
 this clears up the question-editor



the rocket in a vacuum

editor aviation forum

  would you please enlighten me concerning
the moving of an object through a vacuum by
rocket propulsion

   how can an object be guided in a space void
of atmospheres in interstellar space

   what are the plausible means of interstellar
travel 

  thanking you i remain one of your most
enthusiastic readers

bill rose

venice calif

  if two men were out in space and they
were to flex their arms place palms together
and then push against each other they would
both move and in opposite directions the
movement would be causcd by their muscular
action in creating a force that pushed against
both at once the same thing takes place in a
rocket the gases resulting from the explosion
of the rockets have a great tendency to expand
as the gases in any cylinder this tendency
constitutes a force and when the gases expand
and rush out of the exhaust the force of this
movement pushes the rocket in the opposite di-
rection to the exhausted gases now just as
the motion of the two men did not depend on
the atmosphere so tbe motion of a rocket does
not depend on it  and in a vacuum where the
resistance to motion is reduced to almost nil
the rocket develops its greatest power

  the guiding ot tbe rocket can be done by
having tubes set at all angles in the craft thus
if one wishes to go to the right a rocket on the
left is shot and vice versa if one wishes to
go backward a rocket on the front is shot off
the control is perfect

   the most plausible means of interplanetary
not interstellar travel developed so far is the
rocket machine a gravity nullifying craft
however would almost entirely solve the prob-
lem of flight the shot into infinity in
the fall science wonder qdarteblv is a story
of interplanetary flight based on the rocket

  women have patience too

editor air wonder stories

   i have just to-day received our copy of ait
woxdek stories and as i always turn to the
readers column first of all i was much sur-
prised to find mr kicsslines letter criticizing
serials my vote is keei ur toe serials i
read and very much enjoyed the ark of the
covenant-but i do not think i would have
enjoyed it at all if it had been squeezed into
one issue of your magazine along with the
other stories how could it be as interesting-
because half over half of it would be left out
in order to do so or else you would have had
to forego printing it why deprive the rest of
tbe readers from reading a good story because
some man hasnt the patience to wait until it
ends mr kiesslings request is childish and
unreasonable i think good stories should be
printed regardless of length-the longer it is
the more i  enjoy a fine story certainly a
good story is worth waiting lor as all good
things arc oh these men who havent the
patience to wait for an ending to a story they
are reading-and so they think interesting
stories must be sacrificed because they caut
wait until the end of three or four months i
there are plenty of short-story magazines on
the market if mr kiessling wants to read
them-but dont by any means do away with
the serials-print at least two a month and i
certainly dont object to three just so they
remain interesting and anyhow it gives one
something to look forward to eagerly every
month-not that the readers dont pester the
postman or haunt the newsstauds waiting for
your two magazines to arrive let it not be
said that all men lack patience and i hope
that our readers will come forth with a loud
aye for serials-and also members of the
fair sex let it not be said that we women
havent patience either to wait for a good story
please pardon my criticism of your letter mr
kiessling but truly youre unreasonable when
you expect a three- or four-month serial to be
crammed into one issue its evident that the
story meets with your approval or you wouldnt
get it every month

   as to your covers both on science wonder
stories and air wonder stories-they are
marvelous i mean both tbe covers and the
magazines themselves why will people con-
sider bright cheery colors vulgar if color
will help to describe your stories better why
give it all the color it needs your covers
are the pride of my brothers library and my
own-for we have every issue of your maga-
zines-past and present-filed away to spread
these magazines all down on the floor presents
a rainbow of bright colors and bizarre weird
and sometimes really beautiful drawings some
of pauls drawings are weirdly beautiful and
help to make your magazines two of the most
wonderful on the market pauls art as you
said in answer to a letter is going through
the storm of criticism that all things that arc

new go through it takes the public a long
time to get used to a thing sometimes so set
is it on old standards even though it does
boast that it is becoming more broad-and
open-minded by the way why not publish
pauls picture-so we may sec who paints these
wonderful covers

  i hope that you will have some interplanetary
stories in this magazine im rarin  to go
to distant plants and universes i hope that
you will put out an am wonder quarterly
keep the same type of stories in science
wonder quarterly as you print in your
science wonder monthly and the same with
air wonder quarterly although i like air
wonder stories very much science wonder
stories is my favorite of your two magazines
however air wonder stories comes a elose
second stick to stories in your magazines and
leave out non-fiction articles such as the
problem of space flying while i realize
that this is very educating yetthese two maga-
zines are first of all fiction magazines-let them
remain so your stories all contain a treasure
trove of scientific facts that most of us would
not otherwise know of-unless we were making
science a study i must say that your maga-
zine has done a great deal to promote an in-
terest in science-and we are all the better
for reading your magazines and im sure you
deserve a great deal of appreciation for this

ark of the covenant was very fine in fact
i enjoyed all your stories-and i read each

short stories an insult to
magazine

editor air wonder stories

  in answer to mr kiesslings letter in tbe
october issue of your magazine on long or
short serials i am writing my vote of prefer-
ence i prefer the long serials such as the
ark of the covenant the longer the better
if a story has certain good phases it should
be very long with interesting details around it
i have every issue of your magazine and i
always read the reader airs his views
now i have seen more letters asking for long
serials than short ones so mr editor that
should prove to you that longer serials are
wanted the most now i have a knock for
you in your october issue there are seven
each of them is very small excepting
i he ark of the covenant the sky maniac
was fair hut should he longer for an excellent
storjr like that the rest of the stories went
as high as seven pages even less one was four
pages that is an insult to the magazine and
should be righted with a real long one next
month i see that you are asking whether we
readers would like the magazine of short
stories air wonder stories or the magazine
with three large stories i for one am for the
three long stories idea i am sure your readers
mostly would be of the same opinion

  when will the air wonder quarterly be
out

wants interplanetary stories

editor air wonder stories

i have iust finished reading my october i
of air wonder stories and sciencb wonder

stories and thought i would send you my com-
ments regarding the kind of stories i like in-
terplanetary stories arc my first choice then
good aviation stories like tbe ark of the
covenant but not in serial form-more about
that later and then my next choice is stories
of the future times and inventions

  you statcc in your magazine that inter-
planetary stones were not to be included in
air wonder stories why interplanetary
stories generally deal with aviation and i think
air wonder stories is the proper place for
them rather than in science wonder stories

  now for serials-i do not approve of serials
in any magazine by having to wait month
after month as in the ark of the covenant
a person loses the trend of the story and as
for serials keeping up the circulation of your
magazine i agree with mr j r kiessling of
cincinnati that it has nothing to do with it
in fact i personally think that your magazine
would sell a whole lot better without any serials

  now about the length of stories to be pub-
lished i think about four stories in each issue
would be about right  all long stories to be
put in your quarterly instead of running them
 serial form in your monthly magazines

  about tbe cover-better let well enough off
alone the cover was what led me to investi-
gate tbe first science fiction magazine i ever
read after having investigated  immediately
bought a copy and  have been a faithful
reader ever since

           henry e decker

                   river st towanda pa

  we are gradually finding ourselves yielding
to the persistent demand of readers of air
wonder stories for interplanetary stories the
appeal of our readers is based on the idea and
we must admit with a great deal of justifica-
tion that if flight to other planets is not future
aviation then wbat is

  all we are trying to dot as usual is to ascer-
tain more fully  the desires of our readers
and the more vigorous they make their state-
ments of preferences tbe more clearly defined
will be our knowledge of what to do-editor

doesnt mind waiting a month

editor air wonder stories

  the only comments i have to make come
from the reader airs his views you
ask about semis some of the readers seem
to have hysterics if they wait a month to finish
a story i dont i like serials the longer
the better have two eveiy issue start one
where another leaves off if they are as good
as the ark of the covenant or the forever-
to-be-remembered cruise of the skylark have
them last six months or a year tbe longer the
better cant you get a sequel to the latter
story i like sequels too please have as many
as possible

  about long stories have only one or at most
two short stories and the rest as long as
authors can write tfyem

  you ask which of your two new magazines is
the better i think that science wonora is a
trifle ahead of the other because it covers a
wider ground hut air wonder is a close sec-
ond after all the magazine with the best
stories is tbe better and if the two keep tip
as good as they have started it will be a tie
for both will be absolutely unbeatable

  keep up the forum and the questionnaire
in your magazines although i nave no ques-
tions to ask i enjoy reading them

  and finally let me horn in on this eternal
struggle about the covers as long as they are
as good as this month or last month keep them
as brilliant if not more so

                            portland me
mr thomas is evidently one of those and
thcreare a great many who like to pleasurably
anticipate the good things to come we are
like that very often inasmuch as there are
those who will agree and those who will dis-
agree with mr thomass views wc are trying
to please both classes by striking a pood balance
between serials and complete stories in each
issue we register another vote for scienc
wonder stories in our informal contest to
decide which is the best magazine-editor

grandfather walked- father motored-

you will fly

if the sound of roaring motors or the very thought
ot racing through the sky makes you tingle with joy
then you are among the lucky ones for whom fame and
fortune await

tho present demand for trained flyers is so overwhelm-
ing that a pilot can easily command a starting salary
of  a year this is not a mere statement-it is a
positive fact-and comes from reliable authority

a time is coming-and it is not far off-when airplanes
will be as common as automobiles aviation may even
surpass the automotive industry as it has been con-
clusively proven that the airplane can be depended upon
for safe and swift transportation

this is an age of speed

in the near future distance between cities will be
measured in terms of hours instead of miles the
traveling salesman of  today will be the flying repre-
sentative of tomorrow companies that now operate
fleets of taxi-cabs on the streets will maintain squadrons
of taxies for air service

railroads steamship lines manufacturers jobbers and
practically all industries will rely upon competent pilots
expert mechanics and sturdy planes because they will be
able to buy and sell import and export bring and
deliver their wares quicker and cheaper

these things will soon become realities then   
pilots and mechanics will vie for supremacy

skill will count

the best trained men will lead the held they will hold
the most important and highest-salaried positions in
the aviation industry those of lesser qualifications
will take their pick of the leavings while the cream
of the crop will go as just rewards to the men who
wore willing to prepare-men who were not afraid to
make a sacrifice for the sake of their future-men who
will thoroughly understand the how and why ol
aviation

 model of amphibian

this giant air liner bas a -foot wing spread a seating
opacity of  and is powered by thrco  hp motor
it was built by greer students under the supervision of
govt licensed pilots and mechanics

that is why good judgment will tell you to enroll at
greer college-because it is a pioneer and a
leader in the profession of teaching because it has
been training men for responsible positions tor over
 years

greer trained men are masters of the air tho
new  wacos and other planes as well as the flying
instructors at the three greer airports are licensed by
the united states department of commerce

after completing your training at one of these flying
fields under the personal supervision of a licensed trans-
port pilot you will truly be able to say i have won
my wings

from then on there will be no limit to your earning
power-it will depend entirely upon your own efforts
and qualifications

send for your copy of the new greer aviation book just
off the press every page contains an interesting story
which will take you through the twelve floors of greer
shops and laboratories where you will see students
actually at work

your financial success a year from now depends on
what yon are today-begin your career in the worlds
most fascinating profession now    while it is
uncrowded and beckons with open arms thousands of
dollars are paid monthly to skilled pilots and mechanics

the sun is only half as far from south as the
hour hand indicates therefore a convenient
method ia to bold the hour hand on the sun
and take south as the point half-way between the
hour band and  this is simpler than holding
the sun half-way between the hour band and
 but comes to the same thing this can be
done of course only when the sun is visible
and it does not allow for the facts that standard
time is sun time only in certain places and
that the sun is exactly south at noon on only

 rocket-propulsion engineers

editor aviation forum

  i have several questions

  	just what is a rocket-propuuton engineer
i have tor a long time been interested in the
rocjtct experiments going on in germany i
would like to take this type of work for my
life vocation

  	what schools offer such a course

  i believe i understand bow liquid oxygen
is made but it is beyond me bow they can use
it in rockets can you help me

            franklin smith

   m  pox i to city pa

  	we believe that rocket propulsion has not
yet reached the stage where it ban become a
profession what the newspapers may refer to
as rocket-propulsion engineers are engineers
who have made the study of rockets their
specialty

  	no schools offer courses in the subject
but professor r h goddard of clark uni-
versity worcester mass is the leading amer-
ican expert on it

  	you probably understand that oxygen is
the portion of the air which serves to burn a
substance in the pure form it brings about a
rapid ignition with the release of such tre-
mendous energy that it causes an explosion as
with the union of oxygen and hydrogen the
reason for using liquid oxygen is chiefly to
get the oxygen in a concentrated form tbo gas
would require too much space and too much
weight for the containers to be efficient further-
more by having it concentrated greater ex-
plosive power is obtained the oxygen in
practice ignites a concentrated fuel such as
benzine or alcohol or a combination of these
and the gases formed rush through the exhausts
at a tremendous velocity the reaction to the
force of the exhaust propels the plane for-

a watch as a compass

 editor aviation forum

 i have heard that it is possible to use a
 watch as a compass will you please tell me
 bow it can be done

    jerry noonan
    co apache inn

            red star ranch new mexico
in order to use a watch as a compass one
must consider the watch as a twenty-four hour

 is made clear in the illustration accompanying
 now suppose our watch registers noon and we
 wish to ascertain our directions if we face
 the sun with the htrnr hand toward the sun
 it is pointing approximately south that will
 be true also for our watch for at noon the
 hour hand on our watch is at the same point
 on the dial as on a -bour chronometer again
 suppose it is  p m our -bour chronometer
 would show the hour hand at  or lth of
 the way around the face on our watch how-

 astronomical chronometer in other words on
 such a chronometer the hour  would cor-
 respond to noon and the hour of  would be
 midnight so while the hour hand on our
 watch moves around the face once in  hours
 that of the astronomical chronometer would
 move around the face once in  hours this

ever the same relative position will be only at
the figure  which ia also lth of the dis-
tance around the dial while the hour band is
at  which is lth of the way around while
therefore on our astronomical chronometer the
sun is always in line with the hour band-
when  is to the south-on a common watch

 illustrating bow a
 watch can be used
 as a compass at

  p m if the

 hour band of a -
 hour chronometer
 is pointed toward
 the sun the num-
 ber  would indi-
 cate south using
 a watch with 
 numerals on it the
 number  would
 be pointed toward
 the sun at  oclock
 and  would in-
 dicate south

editor air wonder stories

    i have read every issue of your magazine with
 tbe exception of the july issue the magazine
 could not be better

   in the department the reader airs his
views i read a letter of a certain mr john
r kiessling of cincinnati in which he said
that serials should not have more than two
parts i think that he is wrong if the serials
are like the ark of the covenant they can
be as long as the author can make them give
us more serials like it

    the stories that i liked most were

      	the ark of the covenant

      	the invisible raiders

      	around the world in  hours
   the air spy the sky maniac and

 through the air tunnel were pretty good
 i did not like the robot master

before i close i would like to know about
the rocket principle in regard to airplanes

                          san juan p r
 for the rocket principle with regard to air-
 planes we refer mr blanco to the december
 issue of science wonder stories and the
 article entitled the rocket comes to the

 pretty good answer to bis question as well as
 the latest developments on rockets-editor

editory air wonder stories

i have noticed that many of your readers
have sent in a list of air wonoer stories

 and science wonder stories classifying them
 according to their likes or dislikes i had this
 idea and used it for your former publication
 and am now using it on your present stories
 though i have never sent them in to you i
 have a sort of index made up in one of my

--------u- tc f the jtory tjrpe

and in what magazine

 note books giving the title of the story tjrpe
 of story bow i liked it and in whatmagazt
 and the issue i can find it in this i ha

 done for my own information only as i keep
 all of jrour magazines in binders and wben
 the desire comes to read a good story by the
 use of my index i can find at once tbe type of
 stonr which will appeal to my particular mood

here is mv classification for the first three
issues and all of the ark of the covenant

  is excellent and it has to be an extraordinary
 story to get under this class  is very good
 and will bear rereading time and time again

 	is good but one reading is about enough

 	is fair hardly worth mentioning

                   class 
      the ark of the covenant

      the planets air master

                   class 
      the silent destroyer

      the yellow air-peril

      beyond gravity

      the bloodless war

      the air terror

      flight in 

      gass 
      men with wings

      the beacon of airport seven
      islands in the air

                   class 
      where gravity ends

 under the different classes i have also listed
 the stories in the order as i liked them such
 as in class  i liked the silent destroyer
 the best though the others are all dose to it
 under class  i am rather puzzled as it is
 a tie as to which of those two stories i like
 best the first issue of the ark of the
 covenant i classed as very good but as
 tbe story went on i decided i just had to class
 it all as excellent

 regarding mr kiesslings letter in the oc-
 tober issue i will say that i do not care for
 lone serials and really would prefer  say a
 book-length or near book-length story in each
 issue one long story and one or two shorter
 stories because the only reason most editors
 have serials is to keep up circulation and so
 far your magazines have neen fine enough to

 reader without that extra inducement

 keep

anc

 nd now regarding edward e chappelows
 r in your first quarterly his suggestion
 is excellent and i believe you are the logical

 one to start such a club and have a page or
 two of your magazines devotl to the club
 this could be used to settle main questions and
 arguments and keep the different clubs informed
 as to what other clubs were  doing the idea
 being to have a branch club in each state or
 more or less  depending on how the idea goes
 over i believe it would also be a good idea
 to have one of your authors at the head of
 each club if thev wire in favor of the idea
 then we would all be one great big family

thatthe editorial  mind has tucked away lie
carries it with him therefore and everv day
he takes it out and examines it he salts hfs
food and flavors his drink with it our
readers must rememlwr that starting a science

tremendous undertaking it must be a good
one it must have a tremendous appeal and a
fine purpose before we would start it and
we are therefore considering what the nature
of such a club might be and its ultimate pur-

editor air wonder stories

   air wonder stories is certainly a nifty
magazine but being a loyal supporter of
science wonder stories which i prefer to
be my choice i cannot or will not say that air
wonder stories is better or equal to science
wonder stories the reason for this inequality
lies i am certain in the difference between
the range or scope of the two magazine air
wonder stories must content itself with only
aviation stories whereas its aister publication
may have stones dealing with many sciences
on each of which numerous stories may be
written as you well know science wonder
stories therefore can never be uninteresting
or tame

air wonder stories may be divided into
five classes designated by letters a means

of course the ark of the covenant by
victor macclure is in the a class as are also
the silent destroyer by henrik d juvc
the planets air master  by edward chap-

lowell h morrow is an especially good
writer i wish you could persuade him to try
bis hand at a long story for science wonder

 in class b i included tbe following islands
 in the air by lowell morrow the beacon
 of airport seven by harold s sykes the
 bloodless war by dr keller beyond gravity
 by ed earl repp and the flight in 
 by bob olsen

 the impression that harold s sykes wanted
 to convey to us regarding the character of dr
 lawson did not rcach me at all i thoroughly
 sympathized with dr lawson who working
 as a scientist should was disturbed and lura-
 pered by a company of nitwits who build their
 airport dose to his laboratory now who
 wouldnt get sore i know i would

 only one story is in the c class and that is
 the yellow air-peril by harl vincent

 i placed in class d the rest of the stories
 that i have not mentioned these are where
 gravity ends by robert h leitfred and men
 with wings by leslie stone

 there were no stories in the f class but i
 felt very much like putting men with wings
 in it this story had more biology in it than
 aviation and should have been placed in science
 wonder stobies where i feel sure it would
 have received the harsh criticism that it de-
 served well mistakes will happen you know

 as a whole aib wondeb stobies is the best
 science fiction magazine on the market with
 the exception of science wonder stobies in
 a year or two tbe publications will be more
 widely known and with such backers as we
 subscribers are and were good advertising

 there seems to be quite an interesting con-
 troversy arising among our readers regarding
 which magazine science wondeb stobies or
 air wonder stobirs is tbe best we would
 like to bear from more of our readers regard-
 ing their views as to mr kurzejas opinion
 of dr lawson in the beacon of airport
 seven we might say that dr lawson might
 justifiably have felt resentment at the in
 trusion of the airport field near his laboratory
 but to deliberately send innocent men to their
 death to express his resentment is exceeding
 giite definitely the bounds of justification-

quarterly will satisfy readers

editor mir wonder stories

 it was very hard to pick out the best story
 in the october issue of aib wonder stories
 i finally place the stories as follows

 	the ark of the covenant by victor mac-

     clure

 	the sky maniac by henrik dahl juvc

 	the invisible raiders by ed earl repp

 	through the air tunnel by harl vincent

 	the robot master by o beckwith

 	the air spy by edward lee harrison

	around the air in  hours by r h

     romans

 	the reader airs his views

 i am for serials so far your best story
 has been a serial some of your readers dont
 like the story to be continued to the next
 issue when they come to an exciting part i
 think that this makes tbe story all the more
 interesting i was disappointed in not seeing
 a new serial start in the same issue that the
 old one ended in

 i am glad to know that edmond hamilton is
 coming to air wonder stobjes i consider
 him among the best of your authors

 if you put out a quarterly soon the readers
 who want just complete stories should be
 satisfied

 i have a complaint to make on your binding
 its awful please use two staples in holding
 the magazine together

 the illustrations in tbe october issue were
 great keep up the good work paul youre
 getting better in each issue

 an air wonder qoartebly however wc
 may have something interesting to announce
 in the near future about it
 mr darrows views on serials are definite
 enough to make anyone sure of where he stands

inexhaustible as mans
imagination

editor mr wonder stories

after reading the story the ark of the
covenant by victor macclure i will have to
admit that you have stumbled onto tbe best
story since the second deluge the stones
mentioned above are the ones that i consider

 the most peculiar coincidence possible i be-
 lieve happened in connection with the ark
 of toe covenant i was wondering why a
 story like it bad never been published that
 carried tbe details so far and that still was not
 boring when along came the ark as if the
 author had used my thoughts i got nearly
 as big a kick out of it as if it bad been my
 own

 the present story that you are publishing
 cities in tbe air starts out as a fair one
 but it has not the essential details that arc
 necessary for a really good story

 the work you have started is inexhaustible
 as mans imagination and i hope you con-
 tinue tbe careful selection of your stories to
 keep the high level you have begun 

 i believe that tbe cover contest in sciencb
 wondeb stobies will prove quite interesting
 but i dont quite care for stories as short as
 they will be i think the average reading time
 for a good short story should be between eight
 to ten minutes

from a reader of before the time of the
second deluge

          albert e dawson

 grecnview ave chicago 

 mr dawson makes quite an apt statement
 when he says that our work is as inexhaustible
 as imagination we  have long ago realized
 that-that the possibilities inherent in life are
 as infinite as mans ability to conccive them
 for what man conceives based on natural laws
 he will ultimately achieve in other words his
 capacity for achievement is as infinite as time
 our writers are mirroring that capacity of men
 to achieve and although many of our authors
 do not realize the time that is necessary to
 realize what they picture still for the most
 part their predictions aro prophetic so we of
 the early twentieth century may sit back in
 our chairs and have the centuries of tbe future
 rolled back toward us-editor

no strangling in air pockets

editor air wonder stories

 i have just finished reading the november
 issue of air wonder stobies and though the
 stories were not the best i have read i liked
 all of them

 now about tbe short stories the long stories
 and the serials tbe erials are all right but
 there are too many short stories most of
 them i know by heart

did i like them well well see the
air spy was good but short around the
world in  hours needed lengthening like-
wise the invisible raiders when space
ripped open was too poetic in the october
issue through the air tunnel came only
after the ark of tbe covenant cities in
the air was good but i dont see bow it could
be possible for the cities to be able to travel so
fast even with the new device for so many
buildings would offer resistance to the air

 the aviation forum is good keep it up
 the aviation news is hopelessly antiquated
 so take my advice and discontinue it if you
 want to put something good in give a descrip-
 tion of an airplane every month in the
 science wondeb you offered prizes on the
 composition what science fiction means to
 me so why not have what aviation means
 to  me in this magazine  also why not a
 suitable aviation design to appear on the cover
 each month some time ago a friend asked
 me what an air pocket was i think it is a
 vacuum i replied well then how is it
 that the aviator can breathe be came back at
 me well i leave it to you mr editor how
 can be breathe before i sign off i want to
 know what happened to the author of hicks
 inventions with a kick i am sure lie can
 write a humorous aviation story and edgar
 rice burroughs and the quarterly

             ronald j small

new york city

 an air pocket is not an absolute vacuum
 where there is no oxygen but it is an area in
 which the air pressure is very much reduced
 such an area may be only a half or even a
 quarter of a mile long and the aviator may be
 out of it in a fraction of a minute the reason
 why it is dangerous is thqt the sustaining
 force on the wings is very much less in that
 area and the plane very frequently takes an
 abrupt dip it presents however no particular
 danger from suffocation

 we accept gratefully the suggestions for addi-
 tional features for aib wondeb stobies and
 will give them consideration mr fexandie
 the author of hicks inventions with a kick 
 is now traveling abroad and is apparently not
 doing any writing-editor

professor younger speaks

editor air wonder stories

 with reference to your recent letter soliciting
 an expression of opinion on the type of stories
 appearing in air wonder stories permit me to
 quote from your editorial in volume  no 
 engineers and pure scientists are too bound
 by conventions and far too practical and cautious
 to look far into the future they do not as a
 rule risk their reputation by making inspired
 guesses your science-fiction author knows no
 such restraints take jules verne for example
 his five weeks in a balloon though deemed
 impossible at the time it was written has long
 ago become an actuality yet he was bitterly
 denounced and ridiculed when he first published
 it when we read it to-day it sounds hope-
 lessly tame

 out of the first four numbers of air wondbr
 stories i have read most of the stories appear-
 ing and with considerable interest i also note
 with interest in the section the reader airs
 his views that your authors as you point
 out in the case of jules verne are sometimes
 bitterly denounced personally i have no
 denunciation of the authors or criticisms of the
 stories to make i think the magazine is serv-
 ing a purpose and doing it well it is cer-
 tainly a diversion from the everyday facts and
 figures to spend an hour or so in the evening
 letting the imagination run with the authors
 of air wonder stories even if i cannot
 make the neutralisation of gravity compatible
 with my little store of information it is a
 pleasant diversion to conjecture with the author
 the possible results

 it appears to be reasonable that this type of
 magazine with its science stories as differen-
 tiated from magazines dealing with passions and
 lusts of human beings deserves the support of
 the public

associate editor of air wonder stories

 wc feel that professor younger speaks for
 the great majority of broad-minded educators
 they realize that constructive imaginative
 stones with an educational tone to them pro-
 mote an intelligent understanding of tbe world
 about us we therefore appreciate the co-

 ration of men such as

wants lessons on flying

editor air wonder stories

 on reading tbe fourth issue of air wonde
 stois i want lo say that the sky maniac
 was very good and i would like to see more of
 mr juves stories about addisons adventures
 in the future world the ark of the cov-
 enant was one of your biggest successes and
 i would like to see more of such stories in this
 magazine through the air tunnel was
 fair there should be a sequel to the robot
 master in which the invention of h l
 benning is turned over for the benefit of
 mankind

 i also think that your aviation news and
 aviation forum are of interest and of bene-
 fit to the readers you should also do as many
 other magazines on aviation are doing that is
 put in an account on the principles of flying
 and lessons in flying each month

 all the stories were interesting so far so
 keep up the good work and the air wonder
 stories will rise to great heights

larry levine
west new york n j

 it is a pity that in most of our stories-
 the ark of the covenant was a glorious ex-
 ception-that most of the great inventions of
 our geniuses are used for selfish and destructive
 pnrposes we personally do not feel that the
 great minds to-day are bent on attaining a
 selfish control for it is usually true that the
 inventor is not much interested in social affairs
 bis consuming passion is in creation and he is
 perfectly content to allow the affairs of state
 to rest in the hands of others

we must be very careful how wc expand
the features of onr magazines we already
have quite a bit of non-fiction material in air
wonder stories enough to make a nice bal-
ance we arc afraid that we cannot extend
tho non-fiction content of tbe magazine at the
present-editor

editor air wonder stories

   i love to read air wonder stories  my
grandfather  years ago told me that if i
lived to be  years old i would see people
flying through the air and grandfather at tbe
time was over  years old so it can be seen
that flying was on the way even at that time

    but before it came my idea as to how it
 would be done was that somebody would invent
 a gravitv-sbield whereby a mans weight would
 be nullified then he could take two palm-leaf
 fans in his hands and propel himself along
 a very simple construction it one but bad the
 gravity-shield

    nevertheless before it is invented well have
 to fly by some other means so my idea is to
 concentrate the rocket plane and the winged
 plane into one plane this can be done by in-
 serting the propeller of the winged plane into
 the hollow tube of the rocket plane the long
 hollow tube or tubes would be serving their
 purpose the air would be blowing back
 through them and producing the rocket power
 planes thus constructed would not only be more
 concentrated which would be of great advantage
 but their propellers would be more protected i
 besides the propellers would not be blowing
 back against the planes as they do now thereby
 producing work against itself

of our readers of course it is difficult to
judge of such a device that our correspondent
suggests from the mere detail of an idea while
it is interesting we are frankly skeptical of its
practicability on application however some-
thing resembling it has been thought of to be
used on dirigibles for example in the sep-
tember issue of air wonder stories harl vin-

 dirigible having a tunnel through the center
 a propeller blows air through the tunnel so
 that a partial vacuum is formed in the front of
 the vessel this was also predicted as far back
 as  by hup gernsback but between this
 and what mr wilkinson suggests is a far cry
 he would attempt to duplicate with a propeller

 i	have just finished reading the november
 issue of air wonder stories i am sorry to
 say that it is the most unsatisfactory issue of
 that magazine that i have read

 cities in the air by edmond hamilton is
 very good and i look forward to the concluding
 chapter next month when space was ripjied
 open is entirely too fantastic and utterly im

 pssible to make a good story mr wilkins
 am sorry to say does not appeal to my taste
 at all or other his style does not suitcase
 airplanes was fair but mr skinner stretched
 thing a little i think beyond the aurora
 was mr repps poorest attempt at science

 issues were fine but it seems to me that he
 was poor in this one the second shell

icotiintttd from png 

was good how about a sequel to this story
and cities in the air the crystal ray 
would pass on a dark night with a big push
but it certainly would needs lots of push

  the best story you have published so fat with
no exceptions is the ark of the covenant
really mr macqure can be ranked now only
with jules verne or h g wells it cer-
tainly was a most remarkable story with a
finely interwoven plot told in a most inter-
esting way with a wonderful ending how
mr macclure ever wrote such a masterpiece
is beyond me while it may seem a little far-
fetched now yet i believe that all the weapons
and scientific instruments which be explained
with great clarity will change from proba-
bilities to actual reality in a few years i am
sure that everv reader of your magazine wants
another story by this author try and get one
for us will you

  one criticism for your magazine-it is named
alt wonder stories and you publish only
stories of the future why not publish some
stories of present-day aviation so that we
readers can folly grasp its possibilities and its
function then give us the stories that you do
now you cannot expect readers the majority
of whom ill wager do not understand the
workings of the present-day airplane to under-
stand stories of aviation in the future please
remedy this fault and i think you will have
the best magazine published to-day

  your artist paul is certainly a genius the
way be depicts the various stories is wonder-
ful i know that the reason i bought my first
copy of the magazine was because of the
illustration on the front it caught my eye
and  picked the magazine up glanced over it
and in a moment i had purchased it and as
for the silly suggestion by some of your readers
that the covers are too loud why its ridicu-
lous the cover is really the salesman of the
magazine therefore the cover should be attrac-
tive and by taking away the colored illustra-
tion by paul and substituting a drab-colored
affair i am sure that the sales would fall off

  flight in  was good bob olsen ranks
among the best of your writers the air
terror was also very good more stories by
mr morrow would be appreciated the robot
master though you were tardy in presenting
it far exceeded my expectations mr beck-
with rave us the story that i believe ranks next
to the ark of tbe covenant in excellence
it tells wbat we may see developed by man
in the way of the robot in coming years
around the world in  hours was humor-
ous yet it showed us the extent that speed via
air may be reached in coming years the air
tunnel while it was interesting seemed too
fantastic to be sensible and possible i do not
think that tbe air tunnel as mr vincent speaks
of it will ever be perfected

  kindly publish this in the section of your
magazine called the reader airs his views
for as i have criticized you i feel that others
may criticize me and i want r them to do so
because i may be wrong and if i am i want
to be corrected

               watson ruch
                     osceola pa

  we are vcry sorry that tbe november issue
did not meet with mr ruchs approval per-
sonally we thought the stories in it were on
the average better than in any other issue

  tbe reason why we have made our stories of
the future is that we know that  thousands of
readers who wanted aviation stories wanted to
know-not that roan could fly for we all know
that-but they wanted to know the possibilities
of the future instead  of printing broncho
busting or wild-west stories of the air we are
pioneering into the realms of the imagination
and printing stories that are not only thrilling
but stimulating as well

  for those who wish to learn the operation of
the present-day airplane we have started the
aviation forum in which we will answer any
question on aviation thus you will get at
once not only the present-day operation of
planes but als a glimpse into the future-
editor

aviation forum very fitting

editor air wonder stories-

 having been a reader of air woxder
stories since the first issue i decided id like
to state some general opinions about tbe
magazine

  i dont think anyone should kick about the
covers because if anything should sell the maga-
zine and gain for it more popularity artist
pauls drawings ought to settle the question
as to the paper i myself like a good many
others think that it ought to be a trifle better
grade which would not make the magazine so

  the aviation forum is a decided help and
is very fitting for air wowdbr stories in
acceptance to your invitation on views about
serials i think one serial is enough at a
time and begin a new one tbe month after the

air wonder stories

preceding one also two months i long cnouh
to wait for the general run of serials in
regard to your other stories i think three or
four long storjes better than five or six short
ones because in the shorter stories your inter-
est is hardly aroused before the finis

  your best story so far in all issues is
victor macclures ark of the covenant and
i heartily think nearly everyone will agree
with me i have just finished tbe last instal-
ment and was delighted at the ending  hope
wo shall hear more from mr macclure

best wishes to future air wonder stories

dean st clair mitchell

                    north th street

                            lincoln neb

  mr mitchell represents the moderates in
the battle of serials he stands for serials
but those that take no more than two issues
there are many who stand with mr mitchell
but we pose this question to them suppose wc
were able to print a corking good or even an
unusual story of  words jwe have now
such a story in miudj printing it in two
issues would mean devoting practically all the
editorial snace to it that would be unfairto
those readers who may not like the story and
who wish a greater choicc of stories should
we therefore forego giving our readers the
privilege of reading an unusual story bccause
wc must confine it to two issue we are sure
our reader when confronted with such an actual
case would say print it regardless of length

flight in -too early

editor air wonder stories

  ihave just finished reading your third num-
ber of air wondkr stories bob olsens
flight in  was ok the only thing
wrong with that story is that its name is not
a good one and i think its date is a bit too
early to have such inventions but dont pub-
lish any more stories such as the ark of th
covenant or i will send a brickbat a wg
one too instead of a subscription for the next
eight issues of scuitcx wondek stories in the
september issue of science wonder storim

novels boy if you could get mr burroughs
to publish one of bis mars books ill bet

all six stories fine

editor air wonder stories

  have just finished reading the november issue
of air womde stories to which i subscribe
and i must say that all six stories are fine
your magaiine gets better every month when
do we have another story by victor macclure
the gentleman who gave us the ark of the
covenant that was undoubtedly the best
story of its kind that i ever read and i have
read some good ones now if tbe question as
to why there were not a few germans fea-
tured in the ark is bothering mr arthur
h walter why doesnt be write macclure
and ask him i also agree with several of
this months critics about printing your maga-
zine on better paper the kind you use is en-
tirely too heavy and cumbersome also wbile
im writing i want to put in a good word
for your cover artist paul-be sure is a
wonder

  it is very difficult to state with certainty bow
quickly our great inventions will come mr
olsen gives us seventy years to bring about the
state of affairs that he predicts in flight in
 if we look back seventy years to s
we see a nation in which there was no tele-
phone radio automobile flying machine electric
light the telegraph was comparatively new
if we survey the wonders that have come to us
in the past seventy years we must indeed look
for many more during the next seventy-editor

make the quarterly twice as

editor air wonder stories

  i	have just finished reading john r kiess-

  the only practical way to end serials would
be to either make the quarterly twice aa big
or issue an annual or semi-annual along with it

  if you do not follow tbe suggestions above
please do not tart another serial tbe month you
