enchanted bookshelf b wmpmcgivern adventures march gargle listerine quick it may spare you a deep-seated cold or a nasty sore throat in tests with lisrerine antiseptic germs on mouth and throat surfaces were reduced as much as fifteen minutes after a listerine gargle-

up to  one hour after

  we believe this explains listerines astonishing
clinical test record in combatting colds these
tests made over a period of  years consistently
showed

listerine antiseptic immediately starts to kill the
threatening germs which left the other fellows
nose and throat to set up housekeeping in yours

  the more of these germs lisrerine antiseptic
destroys the less chance there is of a mass inva-
sion of the tissue followed by the discomfort of
a cold and sore throat

  regular twice a day listerine antiseptic users
had fewer colds and jeuer sore throats than those
who did not use it

  dont you think in view of these facts that
listerine antiseptic used systematically is a worth-
while precaution against colds as well as an emer-
gency treatment when a cold is coming on if youve
been in contact with those with colds-if youve
been in a draft-if your feet have been wet and
cold-and you feel under par with a cold coming
on never omit the listerine antiseptic gargle

fantastic adventures

ne of the most famous sayings of today
- tell it to the marines originates in a
fantastic story told by a certain sea captain
newly returned from the western ocean to
charles ii of england he told of how he had
seen fish that actually flew through the air like
birds the king and his court were naturally
doubtful about this tall fish story but the
captain persisted thereupon the merry mon-
arch motioned to a lean salt-crusted colonel of
a sea regiment

  colonel the king complained this tarry
breeches here makes sport of us landlubbers he
tells us of a miraculous fish that forsakes its
element and flies over the water like a bird
sire replied the colonel of the marines he
tells the truth i myself have often seen these
fish in your majestys seas around barbados
well decided the king such evidence can-
not be disputed

  that is how it came to be that for more than
 years the u s marine corps which has
fought and is fighting in every quarter of the
globe has had the expression tell it to the
marines attached to it

  its something the japs are learning to respect
too

   oss rocklynne and his wife dropped in
on us the other day enroute to the west
coast where they will spend several months we
gave ross several illustrations which he will
work into stories for fantastic adventures and
amazing stories no doubt youll be reading
the results in a few months

d obert fuqua your favorite gadget art-
ist who has one of his finest gadgets on
the current cover of amazing stories tells this
one about his fellow artist james b settles
who does such fine work on the back covers of
amazing stories it seems that one christmas
jim decided to have a party so he got some
good liquor then called all his friends and in-
vited them all this on the very verge of christ-
mas eve when everybody had already made
plans came time for the party and no one
showed up jim waited a while then decided
hed just have a party by himself so he got
eut his liquor sat down and proceeded to drink
it after a while things got a little blurred to
jim and he began to have memories at one

time jim attended a military school and now
he decided he would find out if he could still go
through the manual of arms jim owned a
beautiful rifle with a telescopic sight on it he
got it out and in a few moments he was swing-
ing the rifle around with great gestures and
finally in the process of shouldering arms
knocked himself completely cold with the sight
he flopped to the floor and lay still a few
minutes later one of his friends feeling rather
sorry about breaking the party date dropped
in and found jim lying on the floor in a pool
of blood with the gun lying beside him horri-
fied the friend rushed to the phone and pro-
ceeded to notify the world in a short time the
doctor arrived and many friends feeling very
terrible about poor jim shooting himself because
no one came to his party the doctor after a
short examination declared that jim was okay
and when he was revived he had his party to
the great relief and joy of his friends

it

ubeck	but the lean young man who had

there was sudden shock in spoken first-he of the tropic-bronzed
the way the word exploded skin and the intense brown eyes-
shock and a tension that leaped like jerked loose from his companions re-
a startled buck and utter incredulity straining hand in flat contradiction

and something more perhaps some-
thing indefinable like an ominous
shadowy foreboding spiced with the
slightest tinge of fear sternly
repressed

  youre crazy ray it cant be

lubecks in australia theyre ex-
pecting to pick him up there any day

lubeclc eyed the

giant daugavo queen crouching over him

         
following the throb of
weird jungle drums from
chicago to south america 
captain holcomb uncov-
ered an astonishing plot


fantastic adventures

  its lubeck all right  he snapped
god knows what hes doing in chi-
cagos loop but hes here and that
means trouble for the u s a

  but it cant be reiterated the
other look at him ray this guy
doesnt even have konrad lubecks
general appearance-

  the bronzed man pulled him back
into a doorway out of the streaming
sea of pedestrians thronging the sun-
dappled intersection of chicagos state
and madison streets both of the pair
wore captains insignia on their united
states army uniforms

  do you think descriptions count
with an ace nazi agent like lubeck
chick he demanded in low-
toned fierceness that devils the
greatest master of disguise the worlds
seen in a hundred years-

 then how-

  i spent two years on his trail i
saw him kill off four of my partners
in succession i watched him slip
through dragnets a mouse couldnt have
gotten past when youre that close
after a man and for that long chick
you dont go by looks any more you
get so you can smell him almost no
matter how he covers up you recog-
nize a hundred little things no one
can disguise-mannerisms gait per-
sonality    things you couldnt de-
fine in a thousand years but-
so-

  so thats konrad lubeck take
it from me chick it is and you
can bet your bottom dollar hes here
for a reason damn his black nazi
soul the lean captains brown eyes
blazed well this time were having
a little of the luck maybe we can
nail him and his whole crew with
him

  young chick williams the other
captain grinned at rays intensity
chick was always grinning he was a

chubby blond fellow with good na-
ture sparkling through his personality
from stem to stern

  together the two watched the man
ray holcomb had pointed out as kon-
rad lubeck he was stockily built
and wore a majors gold oak leaves on
his uniform for several minutes he
had been interestedly inspecting a store
window now he swung back into the
flow of saturday afternoon shoppers
sauntering calmly south on state
street accepting the jostlings of the
crowd with easy good cheer

  its lubeck all right ray grated
gripping chicks arm deep in his
brown eyes was the triumphant gleam
that marks the hunter who at long
last sights his quarry as one they
drifted into the stocky majors wake

rjheir prey paused in a corner
drugstore to buy cigarettes his
shadows fell back taking up a
stealthy vigil through the stores side
window

  the major hesitated by the door-
way for a few moments covering the
wait by opening his cigarettes not
by the slightest flicker of an eyelid did
he betray nervousness or emotion

  a little grin of reluctant admiration
parted sun-bronzed ray holcombs
lips

  no wonder lubecks the ace nazi
agent he muttered to chick out of
the corner of his mouth that devil
never relaxes its a cinch he hasnt
had time to spot us yet but even
though he hasnt any reason to think
hes being tailed he still watches his
back trail he just isnt taking
chances 

  now the bogus major moved toward
one of the telephone booths at the
stores rear he chose one far in the
corner

  ray whistled talk about luck if
drummers of daugavo



we can get in a call-

  the store had a second entrance well
back on the side by using it the lean
young captain was able to slip into
one of the phone booths without expos-
ing himself to his quarry he dialed
hastily outside chick williams stood
at the alert ready to checkmate any
sudden move of the spy

  a voice at the other end of the line
said sixth corps area head-
quarters

  captain ray holcomb of intelli-
gence calling ray snapped give
me g--colonel randolph quick 
its important

  right sir just a moment
  seconds ticked by

  sorry captain holcomb colonel
randolphs left his office for a few min-
utes we cant locate him will any-
one else-

  from the corner of his eye ray
caught a glimpse of moving khaki
chick waved frantically

  lubeck leaving

  no ill try to call back good-
bye

  choking off an exasperated oath
he slid out of the booth again he and
chick took up the chase

  completely casual the nazi agent
strolled on down state street pausing
now and again to window-shop idly
then drifting onward equally unob-
trusive the two captains followed
sometimes behind their prey some-
times ahead but always blending into
the bustling multitude that thronged
the sidewalks in a manner that practi-
cally defied detection

  they reached van buren street
the man in the majors uniform swung
left down the side street he marched
to wabash to michigan

  for a moment then he paused on
the corner and looked around the
next instant he had disappeared down

one of the stairways leading to the
illinois central suburban station

hick williams started to lunge
after him but ray caught his
arm

  hell be waiting at the foot of the
stairs to see if hes being tailed  he
rapped

  even as he spoke he led the way
in a headlong dash across michigan
avenue heedless of traffic on the
other side was another stairway-one
which would bring them into the sta-
tion ahead of lubeck

  in seconds they were onto the plat-
form and waiting for the spy to appear
he came boarded a south-bound ex-
press the two young officers were in
the next car and still together the
three dropped off at hyde park

  here the problem became more
difficult there was no crowd now to
give the intelligence men anonymity
but by dint of much dodging and
ducking they succeeded in trailing the
bogus major to an apartment house
some four blocks from the station

  the building was old narrow and
three stories high staring up at it
from across the street the two young
captains hesitated

  what do we do now inquired
chick leaving the burden of decision
to his more experienced partner

  ray bit his lip his eyes were nar-
rowed and gleaming by rights we
ought to call g- for help he said
damn it though i hate to take the
chance so far weve had a run of
luck sighting lubeck and then manag-
ing to trail him here he hesitated
trouble is if we wait for help im
afraid hell slip out now maybe hes
off guard-

  a girls slender graceful figure
moved into the sun-bronzed officers
field of vision high heels tapping


fantastic adventures

pertly as she walked she turned in at
the same apartment house as had
lubeck

  discretion went with the wind

  come on ray barked

  he and chick were across the street
before the girl had reached the top step
by the time she had fished the key to
the outer door from her purse they
were close behind her ray politely
pushed open the door as she keyed
back the latch he followed her in-
chick on his heels- then cleared his
throat

  pardon me miss-

  the girl pivoted slowly and with
eyebrow lifted inspected the lean cap-
tain from head to foot

  we were sent to this address with
an important message for a certain
major he hurried on now-he
gulped in convincing simulation of em-
barrassment-we find we forgot to get
his name if you knew of an officer
living here    his voice trailed off

  amusement crept into the girls dark
eyes and her lips quivered with the
effort of repressing a smile

  i dont suppose the message gives
the gentlemans name she suggested

  er  no miss its a verbal
message

  at that the girl smiled openly i
hope its not really important after all
then she remarked because a mem-
ory so poor it cant even recall the name
of the addressee certainly will distort
it terribly

jd ays cheeks reddened a trifle under
their bronze and chick gave vent
to a little snort of mirth but the girl
already was turning toward the stair-
way

  follow me she commanded mov-
ing upward with a shimmering of shape-
ly silk-encased legs theres a man
just down the hall from my place who

wears a uniform maybe hes the one
you want and when they reached
the third floor thats his door the
one at the end

  still smiling at their discomfiture
and before they could thank her she
disappeared into her own apartment

  chick grinned i guess we got told
he remarked shaking his head ruefully
and her such a pretty girl too-

  so what we got in here without
using a jimmy or rousing the house
and the odds are weve located our
man

  yeah a pause well what
next

  ray knifed glances about the hall
weve got to get a look into that apart-
ment to see what kind of a set-up
lubecks got and weve got to do it
without him knowing

  fire escapes-

  no dice ray shook his head
that stuffs fine in the movies but this
business of playing peeping tom from
an outside wall on a saturday afternoon
in chicago just doesnt work out

  for a moment there was silence
while both operatives racked their
brains for a solution to the problem
then ray spoke up again

  ive got it

  what how do we do it

  the bronzed g- man squatted down
beside a door midway between the one
the girl had entered and the one she had
indicated as lubecks it bore the num-
ber  in brass figures

  this place is empty he explained
see the dust along the bottom of the
door

  dubiously yeah but maybe that
door just leads into one of the other
places-sort of a back entrance

  ray shook his head no there
wouldnt be a number on it unless it was
a separate apartment he rose come
on
drummers of daugavo



  a few moments fumbling released
the lock the two young officers slipped
inside

  as ray had predicted the apartment
was obviously unoccupied dust lay
thick upon the furnishings high-lighted
by the afternoon sun in the wall to-
ward lubecks apartment was another
door

losing the hall door behind them
ray hurried across the room to this
second portal he dropped to his knees
before it squinted through the big old-
fashioned keyhole

  chick his voice was a hoarse
excited whisper

  got something

  yes this door must open right
into lubecks livingroom   his
voice died away

  his friend hunkered down beside
him anything wrong ray

  no nothing wrong there was
a strange puzzled expression on the
others sun-darkened face i just dont
get it the rooms sort of dark but
i can see figures    like the shadows
of naked women dancing  i never
saw anything like it before it makes
the chills run up and down my spine
somehow    despite the suns
warmth on his back he shivered mo-
mentarily

  here give me a look chick
planted his own fat knees in front of
the portal his face twisted in a squint
what- he jerked back turned on
his lean companion ray do you
hear drums beating    tom-toms
maybe

  ray frowned you too he hesi-
tated i dont know i thought i did
but when i got away from the keyhole
it seemed to stop i thought maybe it
was just my heart pounding

  yeah chick nodded he pressed
his ear against the door then you

only get it when you look through
there isnt any sound really he
licked dry lips nervously i dont get
it ray my head feels so heavy and
funny   

  there was a moments silence then
ray could lubeck have some
girls-

  the lean operative shook his head
no thats not it lubeck doesnt
fool around hes crazy about his wife
insists on having her assigned to help
him and hes such a genius at spying
sabotage he can get what he wants
even in the third reich

  again chick peered through the key-
hole suddenly ray i got it those
are movies not people

  what- ray shoved him aside
chick youre right its some kind
of a tribal ceremony i can see drums
too  a jungle in the background
its a bunch of women torturing a pyg-
my or maybe its an ape

  the lean captain stopped short
turned to face his companion with an
even more puzzled expression than be-
fore but why if those movies
showed plane plants or gun emplace-
ments or troops i could understand
lubeck being interested but sav-
ages-

  maybe it isnt lubecks apartment
after all chick suggested

  and as if to contradict him there
came the sound of voices the two
americans listened tensely

  you have convinced me feinkell
said someone in perfect english yes
the expedition will be long-hard-
dangerous but the results ha hit-
ler himself will decorate us

  konrad lubeck ray whispered
he pasted his eye to the keyhole again
the sound of the master spys voice
had completely erased the strange un-
easiness he had felt a few moments be-
fore


fantastic adventures

teyond the keyhole the bogus
majors arm was about the shoul-
ders of a gaunt stooped man with white
hair now another individual-short
roly-poly-moved into view

  get the evening papers krag
hurry

  jal the plump little man bounced
away a moment later the apartment
door slammed footsteps shuffled down
the hall

  and now barked lubeck we
must pack at once feinkell for me
to stay in chicago is dangerous but
for you i would never have come here
ray turned away from the keyhole
as the gaunt man nodded nows our
chance to nab em chick  while
theyre packing

  what if they try to run for it de-
manded his partner with a worried air
do we shoot

  the lean young captains mouth har-
dened try to take em alive but
if you have to shoot to kill there
was fire in his brown eyes id sort
of like to see them try to get away
when i think of some of the boys these
rats have murdered needlessly

  click i

  as one the two americans whirled
toward the door into the hall from
whose lock had come the sound

  already the door had swung wide
framed in it stood the stocky malev-
olent figure of konrad lubeck mili-
tary mauser in hand behind him and
to one side was the roly-poly little man
he had sent out for papers he too
carried a gun

  and so captain holcomb we meet
again murmured the nazi agent with
murderous politeness a grim smile
twisted his lips i am so pleased to
see you captain that i shall grant
your wish we shall try to get away
again the smile in fact i shall be
very surprised if we do not succeed

  ray did not bother to answer he
was staring death incarnate in the
face and he knew it but chick could
not restrain himself

  how he gasped in blank amaze-
ment

  lubeck favored him with a glance
how did we discover your presence
is that what you want to know and
as the chubby operative nodded as
usual with americans you made a
clumsy mistake while our apartment
was not completely darkened for the
showing of the pictures you observed
we shut off all possible light therefore
the beam of afternoon sun which came
through the keyhole of your door was
clearly visible when you and captain
holcomb put your heads close to the
door the beam was shut off its ab-
sence told us we were being spied
upon

  so now we pay the penalty for our
carelessness said ray

  correct captain holcomb you
will be a martyr to the cause of sci-
ence then smiling sinisterly at the
bewilderment this last announcement
brought krag

  jal

  the force ray

  force ray ray and chick went
tense what-

  the roly-poly little man pulled out
a queer thick-barreled pistol the
americans breath came faster like
coiled steel springs they stood watching

  then for the fraction of a second
lubecks cold blue-grey eyes left them
to glance at the strange weapon

 now

  even as he shouted ray erupted
into action his body hurtled through
the air at the nazi agent chick too
lunged forward

  but lubecks eyes flashed back the
mausers long barrel chopped down on
chicks head the little man with the
drummers of daugavo



queer pistol already had it sighted on
ray his finger was squeezing back
the trigger

  no sound came forth but the lean
young captain stopped short he felt
as if a -pound sledge had slammed
him in the chest he staggered the
world was spinning in a mad rigadoon
he glimpsed chick collapsing in a
fleshy heap the planets of a dozen
universes were exploding in his
brain   

chapter ii
outlaw

jphere can be no excuse for such
a thing thundered colonel jo-
seph randolph g-s sixth corps area
chief his fist crashed down on the pol-
ished surface of his desk in a tumul-
tuous exclamation point

 cant you see ray holcomb
blazed back cant you recognize a
frame when it stares you in the face
and tardily    sir

  the colonels face was dark as a
thunder cloud

  certainly i can see captain he
roared his voice trembling with anger
i can see that you indulged in conduct
thats a disgrace to the whole united
states army let alone intelligence i
can see that it resulted in the uncalled-
for death of one of your comrades-in-
arms what more is there to see isnt
that enough

  my god sir are your eyes so
blinded with formality and circumstan-
tial evidence that you cant understand
whats happened doesnt my record
in the service-my experience trailing
lubeck-mean anything to you the
lean young captains face was pale and
drawn beneath its heavy tan his in-
tense brown eyes burned like live coals
his voice was a whip-lash of passion

  colonel randolph half-rose in his
chair he was a big and powerful man
all bone and muscle and sinew for a
moment it seemed he was going to lose
control completely-to charge out like
a mad bull and attack his subordinate
then slowly he forced himself to con-
trol his rage he sank back into his
seat

  captain holcomb he said grimly
your record is the only reason youre
not on trial for negligent homicide right
now i had you brought here so you
could speak in your own defense before
formal action was taken-

  thank you sir a chance to ex-
plain is all i ask

  the colonel picked up a thin sheaf
of onion-skin reports he glanced
through them

  you were found in a wrecked car
just outside cicero captain williams
was with you and both of you were
reeking with liquor

  yes sir

  you werent hurt not badly at
least just a few minor cuts and bruises
but williams skull was fractured he

died before he reached the hospital

  yes sir choked ray his face
twisted with emotion he didnt have
a chance chick was too fat to be
quick on his feet    and lubeck hit
him over the head with a mauser bar-
rel

  colonel randolph leaned forward
his first anger had gone out of him

  ray he said i wish to god i
could believe your story but how can
i he threw down the reports

  to begin with he continued
theres no question about your being
drunk i ordered our doctor to check
for systemic evidences of alcohol they
found them you were so drunk-
ray gripped the corners of his su-
periors desk until his knucles went
white


fantastic adventures

  you can understand why sir he
cried we both know how easy it is
to pour liquor into a man when hes
semi-conscious then a little more on
my clothes-

 jphe colonel shook his head sorry
ray a liquor store clerk identi-
fied you as having bought the whiskey
found in your car and the drive-it-
yourself outfit who supplied the car
swear you were the man who rented it
but cant you see that says lu-
beck sir the lean young officers
face was beaded with sweat hes a
master of disguise thered be nothing
simpler for him than to masquerade
as me if we were standing side by
side it wouldnt hold up of course but
for casual inspection-like the liquor
store clerk and the car agency would
give- hed look enough like me so they
later would say i was the man who
came to them he wanted chick and
me out of the way but he didnt want
too thorough an investigation so he
planned this frame its old its simple
and the way he did it its nearly fool-
proof cant you see-

  colonel randolph sighed i wish i
could believe it ray he repeated
but look at the facts this lubeck
business for instance

  lubecks in australia united na-
tions operatives have been hot after him
for months by now they may even
have closed in and no man can be
two places at once if lubecks in
australia he cant be in chicago
hes slipped away before sir the
sun-bronzed captain protested pas-
sionately time after time weve
thought he was in one place yet hed
turn up in another-

  his superior waved him down the
description holcomb even you admit
this man you say you followed looked
nothing like konrad lubeck williams

-whod studied his photographs like
every other operative- didnt recog-
nize him from beginning to end you
admit yourself-

  but disguised-

  the disguise angle is a bit over-
done ray actually disguise conceals
very little from a man who has studied
the portrait parle system you know
that yet williams couldnt recognize
this man

  furthermore lubeck never works
without his wife time after time hes
taken the maddest sort of risks in order
to have her with him hes never
tackled an assignment without her
where was she when you were watch-
ing lubeck in his apartment

  she-she could have been away
temporarily sir the beads of sweat
were joining to roll down rays fore-
head his throat felt tight his lips dry

  the colonel shook his head your
own statement made just afteryouwere
found in the car rather precludes that
you said lubeck ordered this man
feinkell to pack at once they were
getting ready to leave there was no
mention of waiting for lubecks wife
freda to return

  maybe she was disguised sir-
disguised the colonel raised a
bushy eye-brow disguised as what
captain one of the chairs in lubecks
apartment

  the lean young officer licked his lips
fumbled frantically for an answer

  as    as    well maybe as
one of the men sir as feinkell   
or the little man krag he suggested
lamely at last

d eally captain holcomb youre
trying my patience colonel
randolph snapped brusquely im
trying to give you the benefit of the
doubt then you say a thing like that
-knowing as you do that freda lu-
drummers of daugavo



beck is a small slender young woman
he riffled the onion-skin reports uwhat
else have you to say what else that
is that makes sense

  his subordinates brown eyes flashed
i guess i havent got anything that
makes sense as you call it he re-
torted angrily all i know is that i
recognized lubeck how i cant tell
you i cant cite a single definite char-
acteristic but i knew it was he and-
sorry holcomb mental telepathy
and clairvoyance are not as yet recog-
nized as scientific techniques of coun-
ter-espionage im afraid youll have
to face the consequences of your be-
havior even though you do claim its a
frame-up good day the big officer
turned back to his paper work in a
gesture of dismissal

  but ray would not let him go

  the apartment sir he cried
surely youll at least investigate-
colonel randolph turned on him
naturally captain holcomb he
snapped g- takes nothing for
granted the investigation was a mat-
ter of course its already been made
you mean-

  i mean-oh ill let you have a talk
with the man who did the job the
big man pressed a desk button

  less than a minute later a quiet
young man in civilian dress entered the
office

  yes sir

  colonel randolph jerked his head in
rays direction

  tell captain holcomb what hap-
pened at your investigation of that
hyde park apartment lieutenant
the operative turned to ray i
went out to check on whether konrad
lubeck was living at the place he
explained to begin with i checked
the caretaker or janitor or whatever
you want to call him  he told me the
apartment in question hadnt been oc-

cupied in nearly two months

  what

  thats right the operative nodded
his reaffirmation he said no one lived
in it

  of course i didnt take his word
for it i went up to the third floor and
investigated and the place was empty
all right the floor and the furniture
were dusty no tracks in the dust
either

  but i was there ray protested
bewilderedly he felt himself tremble
a little wondered vaguely if perhaps
his mind was slipping-if maybe he
had actually imagined it all

  then he remembered chick chick
had been with him when he trailed lu-
beck chick had visited the apartment
with him too and now chick was
dead-dead with a fractured skull

  the lean young officers lips com-
pressed to a thin dangerous line he
was sane all right he had imagined
nothing but konrad lubeck was the
cleverest nazi agent alive endowed
by the devil with a fiendish ingenuity
that enabled him to disappear without
a trace leaving his victim behind to
hang

  that janitor he grated he
must be one of them his eyes
burned let me talk to him ill
strangle the truth out of him 

colonel randolph inter-
rupted curtly we are not the
gastapo captain torture is not our
line you should know that

  the rebuke stung

  how about the apartment next to
lubecks he demanded to cover his
embarrassment

  but his first nervousness was gone
now once again he was captain hol-
comb the american operative-young
in years but old in trouble a man
with a hair-trigger brain a relentless-


fantastic adventures

ness and a resourcefulness that marked
him so that even konrad lubeck recog-
nized him and called him by name

   the lieutenant who had investigated
the apartment house frowned shook
his head

   nothing doing there either the
place was occupied not vacant i
talked to the tenants they said theyd
been living there for nearly a year
and the wife told me shed been at
home all yesterday afternoon so that
no one could have been in her apart-
ment

   but the apartment itself just the
 fact that my description matched-
sorry sir but it didnt oh there
was a door there all right but you
couldnt have looked through the key-
hole because that whole wall was lined
with bookcases

  ray bit his lower lip savagely
checkmated at every turn he tried
to think of another angle

   the girl on the third floor he ex-
claimed suddenly she told us a major
lived down the hall from her 

  the lieutenant smiled patiently
im afraid she was a little bit mixed
up he commented i talked with
her and she admitted shed only lived
in the building a short while

   whats that got to do with it
everything she still doesnt know
anyone to more than say hello and
since theres a major living in the
same relative apartment on the second
floor that you said lubeck was occupy-
ing on the third-

  a major maybe hes the one
maybe he moved downstairs he
could- rays eyes were burning
with excitement

   the other g- man shook his head
no dice i saw this fellow hes
in the field artillery home on furlough
i checked his papers and his finger-
prints then re-checked with the service

even talked with his wife and kids
hes on the up-and-up i guarantee
it

  but the girl-

  forget it the lieutenant brushed
the idea aside impatiently she gave
me the same line at first-that there
was a major living down the hall from
her but when i took her to the
apartment and proved it was vacant
she finally broke down and admitted
she might have been mistaken-that
maybe the man she saw was on the
second floor instead of her own

rjhe mans self-confident attitude
nettled ray sure he snapped
i dont doubt that she admitted she
might have been mistaken after you
got through brow-beating her but i
was there and i saw konrad lubeck
in that apartment at the end of the
hall his eyes stabbed at lieutenant
and colonel alike besides the fact
that you found that girl proves chick
and i were at that apartment-

  colonel randolph interrupted his
voice was brusque it proves you
were there nothing more it doesnt
indicate what condition you were in
it doesnt prove that lubeck was there
all it testifies to is your own uncertain
mental state-remembering some things
and getting twisted on others

  that isnt fair sir ray flared
he hunched forward resting his hands
on his superiors desk there was ten-
sion in every line of his lean brown
face

  im sorry you think so captain
holcomb snapped back the colonel
frankly however i cant waste any
more time with you

  from the start ive considered your
past record ive given you the ben-
efit of the doubt on every point ive
considered every mitigating factor

  but i still come out with the same
drummers of daugavo



answer youre obsessed with the no-
tion that konrad lubeck is in chicago
you hold to that in spite of everything
you disregard all facts in your origi-
nal statement you rambled at length
about lubeck spending his time watch-
ing motion pictures of a crowd of na-
tive women yet you admitted you
yourself couldnt understand why he
was doing it

  he talked to feinkell about an ex-
pedition the young captain blazed
he said hitler would decorate them
both if they succeeded-

  wait til im finished young man
thundered colonel randolph youll
do well to remember that im still your
superior even though i also have been
your friend

  ray reddened beneath his tan yes
sir im sorry sir

  all right thats better the
other relaxed the fact remains
however that the only real answer you
have to the charges facing you-grow-
ing out of your driving while drunk
and williams death-is that youve
been framed

  its not good enough captain
holcomb not nearly good enough
im left without any alternative i
must turn you over to the civilian
authorities for trial on charges of neg-
ligent homicide as a result of driving
while drunk

  his subordinate stared at him

  you mean he choked that ive
made no impression on you whatso-
ever

  not enough to justify action
my god sir- rays eyes were
blazing his hands had knotted into
white-knuckled fists

  colonel randolph turned to the
young lieutenant who still stood at
attention in the background

  lieutenant there are two police
officers waiting in the outer office

please escort captain holcomb to

them

jphe moment that followed was the
   longest in rays life

  in his minds eye he saw himself in
court saw the judge pronouncing sen-
tence saw the guards leading him
away to prison

  but overshadowing all the rest-
dwarfing it to puny insignificance-he
saw the mocking smile of konrad lu-
beck brimming with the evil satisfac-
tion of another goal achieved he
could visualize the germans report
describing in detail how one american
agent had been killed and another
framed for his death

  he saw chick too grinning as of
yore it sent a strange pain shooting
through him for even in the relatively
short time he had known the chubby
intelligence man he had come to think
of him as a good friend

  another loop of the gordian knot
that confronted him sprang into promi-
nence again it was lubeck but from
a different angle

  this time he saw lubeck in action
   stalking like a menacing wraith
through dank jungles    climbing
mountains swimming rivers and in
the end reaching his goal-a goal that
spelled disaster for the united states
for no petty mission could be worth
the nazis while

  and then suddenly captain ray
holcomb realized the truth hideous in
its clarity someone had to stop kon-
rad lubeck not because of any per-
sonal feeling not because of savage
desire for vengeance no those were
unimportant

  he ray holcomb must stop lubeck
as part of his duty to his country

  if his country did not understand
his motive it was unfortunate if he
died as a result of his efforts that was


fantastic adventures

too bad also but try he must

  ok captain said the lieutenant
at his elbow this way

  with an effort ray let the tension
drop from him his shoulders slumped

  all right

  he turned to go the other opera-
tive was paying him little heed rays
right hand closed in a bony fist like
lightning striking he pivoted on one
heel his fist came up in a vicious
blow

  straight to its mark it drove
straight to the young lieutenants jaw

  crack

  his victims head snapped back
the knees buckled the lieutenant
crashed to the floor out cold

  holcomb came colonel ran-
dolphs roar stop-

  but ray already was across the
room and out the private door which
led into the hall he sprinted for the
stairway took it five steps at a time

  half an hour later he paused on a
corner a police squad car was abreast
him waiting for the light to change
through its open windows ray heard
the police radio call

      name ray holcomb this
man is wanted locally for manslaughter
and by the army for desertion ap-
proach him with care he is danger-
ous that is all   

chapter iii

escape to jeopardy

rjhe cubbyhole marked janitor
acted as sort of an entryway be-
tween the apartment houses outer door
and its cellar now five hours after
rays late-afternoon escape it was
completely dark

  damn the lean young officer mut-
tered as he stared across an alley at
the little rooms blackened panes ive

got to get to that janitor lubeck and
his pals have flown the coop by now
no doubt about that and theyre too
smart to leave clues

  stealthily he crossed the alley every
nerve on the alert for five long hours
now he had been hiding waiting for
night to fall so that he could come here
to the place where konrad lubeck had
made his headquarters

  a dozen times he had given up hope
that he would ever make it time after
time he had escaped military and civil
police almost by the skin of his teeth
once he had had to run nearly a dozen
blocks before he could throw off pur-
suers never before had the omni-
presence and relentlessness of the law
been so impressed upon him he felt
like a hunted beast

  and now at last here he was drawn
to this spot by some vague theory that
in this house he might conceivably find
the clue which would lead him to kon-
rad lubeck

  as quietly as possible he forced open
a small window close beside the door
reached through and turned the knob
another moment he was inside

  instinctively he shrank back against
the wall

  if i got shot here he told himself
with grim humor theyd give the guy
who did the job a medal  i hope
that janitor didnt go to bed early

  his pencil flash shot a thin beam of
light around the tiny room it was the
home of a tidy man ray decided
everything in its place the bed was
neatly made the carpet was clean
in one corner was a small desk its drop
front closed a big standard typewriter
rested on a chair beside it while atop
it was a row of well-worn books

  the lean young officer crossed the
room on tiptoe with his light he in-
spected the volumes

  all were in german
drummers of daugavo



  so thats it said ray half-aloud
his eyes bright with excitement the
caretakers a german himself prob-
ably thats why lubeck moved in here
he knew he could depend on this fel-
low

  next he tried the desks drop front
it was unlocked but he found little
inside-only a handful of letters from
germany some stationery and the
other miscellany that accumulates in
any desk

  he gave the rest of the room a sum-
mary search without expecting to find
anything of great importance nor did
he

  that task completed he sat down on
the bed to consider the next move

  its a cinch they cleaned out the
apartment upstairs pretty thoroughly
he decided at last that means that
whatever stuff was left should be down
here in the trash heap

a gain the sun-bronzed american
got to his feet he went into the
cellar

  this too was well-kept the floor
had even been swept recently but over
in front of the furnace was a large box
containing what was apparently the
days accumulation of junk and gar-
bage there was so much of it that ob-
viously it included the refuse from
every apartment in the building

  anh ray spat his disgust as he
plunged into the unpleasant task before
him bit by bit he removed the trash
from the box and spread it on the floor
working on the remote hope that some-
thing in it might give him the lead he
sought

 my god

 the g- mans stomach nearly
turned over he stared down at the
small round object in his hand at
first he had thought it was an orange
but now in the light of his torch he

realized the truth-

  a shrunken head

  rays hand-the one holding the
gruesome object-was trembling he
licked his lips nervously tried to
analyze the strange feeling of fear that
came over him as he stared at the
sightless eyes and shriveled face

  he had seen heads like this one be-
fore-every long-time resident of equa-
torial america has run into them at one
time or another but somehow this
one was different there was something
sinister about it something hideous

  its like yesterday he muttered
staring down at it i can hear drums
beating when i look at it   

  he shifted uneasily a thousand
eyes seemed to be leering at him from
the blackness of the cellar his skin felt
taut and uncomfortable then

  those pictures that feinkell fel-
low must have taken em in jivaro coun-
try in ecuador or around the mun-
durucus tribe in brazil

  laying the head aside he went on
with grim determination to sort the re-
mainder of the debris but after an-
other half-hour of trying to puzzle out
some information from the trash he
gave up and returned to the janitors
quarters taking the shrunken head with
him he wondered again where the
caretaker himself was

  ive got to have somebody who can
give me some real information he
grated right now i havent got a
thing to go on i can guess that fein-
kell and lubeck are going on an ex-
pedition from this head-he stared
down at it and in spite of himself
shivered again- the movies yester-
day and what little i heard of lubecks
talk but that could all be phoney be-
sides south americas a big place
even if i were sure they were going
there i wouldnt have a chance in a
thousand of finding em


fantastic adventures

  still racking his brain he sat down
on the janitors bed again his lean
face was puzzled his forehead wrinkled
by a frown under his breath he cursed
the day he had heard of konrad lu-
beck squirming restlessly as he did so

  the squirming dislodged the shri-
veled head it dropped off the edge of
the bed rolled from sight beneath it

  damn exploded ray he leaned
over to retrieve it thrusting an explora-
tory hand into the blackness in search
of it

  another hand met his

tt was cold as ice-cold with the chill

  of the unburied dead a cry of
sheer unashamed terror rose in rays
throat but somehow before it be-
came a sound he stifled it trembling
he played his light beneath the bed

  he knew then why the janitors lit-
tle room had lain in darkness for here
beneath his own bed lay its occupant
he was dead had been so for many
hours shuddering a little the young
officer dragged the corpse out into the
open

  the mans eyes were open staring up
at the ceiling in frozen fear his fore-
arms were jammed tight against his
chest palms out as if he had died try-
ing to push away his murderer and on
his throat were great bruises where
powerful hands had strangled him

  ray searched the body hurriedly
found nothing he scrambled to his
feet putting the shrunken head in his
pocket

  time to get out of here he mut-
tered choking a little at the horror of
it all he moved toward the door

  then his eyes lit again on the type-
writer beside the desk mental gears
clicked into place he raced back to
the pitch-blackness of the cellar

there in the pile of discarded ref-
use he found the thing he had remem-

bered-an empty typewriter ribbon
box its label indicated that it was
for the same model machine as that in
the other room

  seconds later he had removed the
ribbon from the typewriter he
scanned it eagerly under his light

  letters stood out on the new ribbons
surface-clear-cut easily read because
the ribbon had been used so little it
had not even reversed itself the words
were in german they made up a
lengthy report referring several times
to a mysterious mission

  nothing important so they didnt
bother putting it in code he told him-
self hurrying to finish with a savage
disappointment deep inside him

  but before he could complete his
reading of the message a flash of light
caught his eye it came from the alley
outside the little rooms window

  hastily extinguishing his own torch
and stuffing the typewriter ribbon into
his pocket ray slipped close to the
window he looked out he caught
a glimpse of a big car with men swarm-
ing out of it a groan escaped his lips

  g- he choked some genius
figured id come here

  turning on his heel he ducked back
into the cellar there to peer anxiously
out a front window he could see grim
figures scurrying through the darkness

  and then it came to him he who
had said he would like to strangle the
truth from the janitor now was block-
aded in this cellar with the caretakers
corpse

  beads of sweat formed on his fore-
head worry sent chilly prickles up
and down his spine

  i havent got a chance in front of a
jury he exclaimed aloud if they
catch me im as good as hanged

vutside a whistle blew its silvery
trill coming faint to rays ears
drummers of daugavo



he ran back across the big room
ahead of him loomed the slanting black
bulk of a flight of stairs

  thats it i can stall em off by
going up

  he sprinted up the steps halting in
the first floor hall to listen briefly for
sounds of pursuit there was none
but he heard someone fumbling with a
door stealing close to the front en-
trance he looked out

  almost as he did so someone gripped
the knob the lean young officer
glimpsed the figures of intelligence men
in the street beyond he ran for the
second floor almost before he reached
it there were men in the halls below

  panic seized him for an instant he
rushed for the third floor three steps
at a time below him footsteps
clumped upward

  tense and wary as a rattler ray
stood in the third floor hall his brown
eyes probed every nook and cranny for
a means of escape

  it came to him then that there was
no way out-that with this cordon
around the house he was inevitably
trapped unless he could hide

  but where was there to hide two
of the apartments he felt confident
were empty for lubeck and his hench-
men certainly were gone to take ref-
uge in them would be futile his fellow-
operatives would drag him out like ter-
riers do a rat the third-

  the girl he exploded thats
it

  even as the thought struck him he
was moving his hand gripped the
knob of the girls apartment door it
was unlocked he burst in

  oh

  it was not so much a word as a little
cry of fear the girl who had pointed
out lubecks apartment to him sprang
from her seat she clutched her scanty
negligee close about her

  grim-faced and panting ray stood
with his back to the door he could
still hear the faint clumping of search-
ers footsteps

  what do you want the girl de-
manded a little lilt of terror in her
voice

  the young officer stared at her his
eyes narrowed and intense this girl
was his last chance he had to judge
her rightly he probed her dark eyes
the firm set of her small chin semi-
consciously he noted the black hair
that framed the smooth white oval of
her face the shapely yet slender figure

  suddenly he reached his decision

  i want you to hide me he said

  what there was incredulity in
her eyes

  g--thats army intelligence-is
looking for me they think im crazy
or a crook or both

  so why should i hide you de-
manded the girl im an american
if youre wanted id be the last one
to protect you

rjhe footsteps in the hallways were
growing louder coming closer

  ray shoved his wallet-full of identi-
fication papers at her here look
at these im with intelligence too
but ive run onto something so hot no
onell believe me im framed for a
murder rap sure if i dont get away

  why should i believe you the
girls eyes searched his but the first
rush of fear had gone out of them

  ray met her gaze to tell you the
truth i dont know he confessed ac-
tually youd probably be foolish to be-
lieve me he hesitated i guess im
just hoping he said at last and its a
mighty slim hope

  the only reward i can promise you
is the possibility of a few years in the
penitentiary for harboring a fugitive
im hoping though    that somehow


fantastic adventures

you will be willing to gamble that im
on the level if you do feel that way
maybe-and its a long shot im warn-
ing you-it will be the means of help-
ing the united states to win the war
he stopped there was really noth-
ing more he could say either she be-
lieved him or she didnt and in either
case shed have to make up her own
mind

  footsteps were coming closer and
closer now they stopped outside the
apartment door there was a thunder-
ous knocking

  rays eyes were still locked with the
girls for a century it seemed they
stood in silence then as the knocking
began again she moved

  come on she said abruptly ill
try it

  she led him to a big door

  open it she ordered

  ray obeyed down came a built-in
bed

  get in

  the lean young officer stared at her
what do you mean get in where
just lie face-down on the bed with
your head toward the foot she ex-
plained hurriedly as the knocking at
her door grew louder then ill put
the bed back up when its closed
youll find you can squeeze over to one
side back of the paneling no one can
see you then even if they open up the
bed again this things a home-made
affair apparently and the one board is
loose then answering the knocks
just a moment im coming give me
a chance to get something on

  the next instant she jacked the fold-
ing bed-and ray-into the wall and
closed the door he hastily squirmed
sidewise as instructed and found him-
self in a musty space between the walls

  i just hope she meant it when she
said shed help me he muttered grin-
ning in spite of his situation this cer-

tainly would be the devil of a spot to
be caught in

he could hear voices in the girls
apartment now g- agents were
explaining why they had to search her
rooms and she was co-operating albeit
somewhat irritably

  a few seconds later light streamed
into his eyes through a crack and he
knew they had opened up the bed he
stood stiff as a ramrod while a drop
of sweat trickled slowly down his spine
he could never remember his mouth
having been so dry before

  then the light went out again with a
click that indicated the door-bed had
closed more minutes passed ray re-
laxed but only slightly at last how-
ever he heard the faint slamming of
a door and breathed a sigh of relief
moments later the bed again opened
its all right you can come out
now the girls voice said

  the bed closed ray squeezed back
over onto it it opened once more he
lurched out into the light blinking
and took the girls hands in his

  lady he declared i dont know
who you are or where you came from
but if you ever need a right arm look
me up and ill cut mine off for you
she smiled an easy amused smile
ill have my reward she announced
if i just dont read in tomorrow morn-
ins sun that youre from the gestapo
the lean young officers lips smiled
but the old intense gleam had come
back into his brown eyes he hurried
across the room glanced out the win-
dow g- cars which had been parked
in front of the house were gone he
turned back to the girl

  pardon me for rushing off he
apologized but ive got to get going
he reached the door to the hall in
two quick steps

  so long and thanks again
drummers of daugavo



  he opened the door started to step
out into the hall

  got you  cried a triumphant voice
an arm flashed down

  by sheer reflex the bronzed intelli-
gence man sprang back from beneath
the blackjack blow he slammed shut
the door then jumped aside fearful
that a colts leaden messenger of death
would follow him in

  the girl was facing him her eyes
wide with fear what-

  some smart op must have suspected
something ray grated theyve got
me trapped here now i cant even do
any shooting those are my own bud-
dies out there he laughed harshly
thus ends my bright idea id
better give up before they start blowing
holes in that door

  as if in echo a voice shouted come
out with your hands up holcomb or
were coming in shooting

  the girl caught his arm

  this way she gasped

  blocked on all fronts he followed
she led him into the kitchen

  here she indicated a small door
near the floor the laundry chute 

jphe lean officer wasted no words

  he wormed his way feet first into
the chutes cramped dimensions a
moment later he was sliding downward
only the friction of his own body
against the sides slowing his precipitate
fall he landed with a thud in the cel-
lars blackness

  before he could stagger to his feet
a heavy object shot out of the chute
and hard against him

  oh came the girls voice what
a ride that was

  you ray helped her erect while
she fumbled awkwardly with an arm-
ful of feminine garments my god
girl what did you do that for

  her soft half-frightened laugh was

like a night breezes caress

  she said how many years did you
say id get for harboring a fugitive
mister in other words youve taken
on a partner

chapter iv

the shrunken head

aptain ray holcombs lean face
was haggard in the grey light of
false dawn he stared gloomily out the
cheap hotel rooms smudged window

  relaxed on the big bed behind him
sheila murray-that he had learned
was the girls name-lay watching him
her dark eyes followed him as he turned
once again to pace the floor

  ray youve got to get some rest
she reminded him for the dozenth time
ever since we got away from the
apartment house youve been holding
yourself at a tension why dont you
try to go to sleep before it gets light
an angry gleam burned in the young
officers eyes i cant sleep he
snapped ive got to figure an angle-
something thatll tell us where to go
we cant stay here forever like rats
in a hole

  the girl got up

  youre so tired you cant think
she told him come on youre going
to lie down give me your coat
rather than argue ray took the
garment off and handed it to her ignor-
ing his disgruntled air she marched him
toward the bed

  lie down she commanded then
staring at the coat no wonder mens
clothes always look like theyd been
slept in what on earth have you got in
these pockets

a head ray sighed wearily an
ugly shriveled shrunken indian head
uhhh the girl shuddered she
drew out the ghoulish trophy laid it on


fantastic adventures

the stand beside the bed and began
emptying the other pockets

  whats this typewriter ribbon for
ray glanced up didnt i tell you
about that i saw the typewriter in
the janitors room and all of a sudden
it hit me that he probably wouldnt
have any use for one but lubeck
would and he might have left it behind
because it was so heavy then i re-
membered seeing a ribbon box for that
model in the trash i thought the rib-
bon might give me a lead but no dice
he explained how he had read the mes-
sage from it and his disappointment
did you finish it

  say thats right the lean opera-
tive raised himself on one elbow
here lets see the thing its a waste
of time but i might as well check it all
the way through

  picking up where he had left off he
read aloud on through the monotonous
routine of a formal report

  and then he saw the last five words
  jetzt gehen wier nach quito
he read and suddenly jubilation was
singing in his voice

    we go now to quito  sheila
translated fluently her lovely face puz-
zled whats that

ay gripped her hand

  its the jackpot little lady
he cried its the thing weve been
looking for-the place we can pick up
konrad lubecks trail and it fits in
with the movies i told you about and
the shrunken head

  but where-

  quitos the capitol of ecuador he
grinned almost boyishly but the man-
hunters intensity was burning in his
brown eyes south america here i
come 

  the girl shot him a pointed glance
did i hear you say here  come 
she inquired

  the bronzed g- mans face grew
serious im afraid so sheila youve
helped me more than i can ever tell you
but now ive got to be on my way ill
always remember-

  no

 what-

  the dark eyes flashed fire no
im not going to be left behind you
got me into this business and now im
going to stay with you

  but you cant sheila ray pro-
tested im nearly broke-

  all the more reason for taking me
ive got a little money tucked away in
a safety deposit box

  the lean young officer sighed look
sheila id like to have you with me
i dont blame you for wanting to go
but this proposition is just too danger-
ous lubeck plays for keeps besides
if you were to come along youd never
be able to square yourself with the law
as it is you can claim i forced you or
scared you into helping me

  and now you listen to me captain
ray holcomb the girls lips were
twitching in a little smile she took his
hands in hers

  to begin with i dont care if it is
dangerous you never bothered to ask
me what i did for a living well ill
volunteer the information then im a
free-lance feature writer and if you
think you can talk me out ov what may
be the biggest story of any writers
career youve got another think com-
ing no ray you havent a chance in
the world to get rid of me im in on
this party and i intend to stay that
way 

  they argued on for an hour but in
the end ray gave up in despair for
who ever heard of a mere man dissuad-
ing a young and beautiful woman from
her purpose

  the days that followed were a night-
mare to them both they crossed the
drummers of daugavo



country to san francisco with a driver
contacted by a fly-by-night auto tran-
sit company they left the united
states on a tramp freighter whose cap-
tain was not too particular about his
passengers if his palm had been crossed
with silver a crooked ecuadorian of-
ficial forgot to ask for their non-exist-
ent passports when they contributed
most of their remaining cash to his
private old-age pension fund

and then at last they were in quito

a days discreet inquiries told them
the story yes a party answering
the description of konrad lubecks--
a stocky man a gaunt man and a short
fat man-had been here

  where were they now

  a shrugging of shoulders quien
sabe

  everywhere the answer was the
same night found a disgruntled ray
slumped in a chair staring dourly at
the shrunken head his one remaining
lead-if lead it was

  its a long shot he said finally
  sheila looked up what is

  this head but maybe itll take us
to lubeck

  i dont understand how can it
here he beckoned her to him
ive seen a lot of heads at one time or
another but never one like this

 you mean-

  it must come from some mighty ob-
scure tribe it isnt prepared like most
the mouth for instance he traced it
with his forefinger see its not
sewed there arent any cords hanging
from it either

  the girl shivered its ghastly
then but do all the tribes do it the
same

  pretty much so thats why i cant
figure where this one comes from at
first i took it for granted that this was
just another jivaro head but the more

i study it the more i realize it isnt
the ears for instance - the jivaros
hang feather ornaments in em but
this one hasnt any

  sheila examined the orange-sized
trophy curiously

  its strange she said but it seems
almost as if i can hear drums beating
in a kind of weird rhythm when i hold
this

  so can i the lean bronzed young
officer nodded his agreement thats
another thing thats strange about it
its almost as if the thing had a per-
sonality  his voice trailed away

  how do they make them ray how
do they shrink them i mean

  the intelligence man grinned wry-
ly its a messy business he said
they start it off by parting the hair in
the middle then they slit the skin
from the crown to the base of the skull
-see he probed into the long hair
with his fingers

  the next instant he was tense as a
taut cord

 what-

  ray sheila gripped his shoul-
ders whats wrong tell me

  the lean young officers fingers were
searching through the shrunken heads
hair

  it hasnt been slit he exploded
theres no seam

  but-what- the girls eyes were
bewildered as her tone

  but ray did not bother to answer
his piercing eyes were concentrated
on the shriveled mummy-like brown
face of the shrunken head he whipped
out his knife and with one stroke
ripped open the head cutting straight
down the face

  then with trembling fingers he
turned back the skin while the girl
watched in abject horror

  look

  he peeled the skin back farther


fantastic adventures

  there staring up at them was the
gruesome face of a tiny skull

t dont understand sheila whis-
pered whats the matter
dont you see the skulls not been
taken out its been shrunken too
still inside the skin

  the girls eyes went wide how can
they-

  they cant ray interrupted no
tribe does it all of them remove the
skull then shrink the head they
cant shrink bone

   maybe its  a  a babys head
no he shook his head emphat-
ically the skin is too thick too tough
sos the bone of the skull

  but what does it mean ray tell
me

  the young captain got up he paced
the floor for a few moments biting his
lower lip nervously his eyes narrowed
and intense

  please ray-

  all right understand me sheila
i may be wrong but this is the way it
looks to me

  somewhere back in the jungle out

  	the methods used to shrink heads are quite
elaborate and accompanied with much ceremony
the head is cut open at the back the skull re-
moved and then the skin is sewn back in place
packed with hot sand in repeated operations the
skin is gradually shrunken down until the head is
the size of a small monkeys features hair etc
are retained to a certain degree and it has even
been claimed that certain of these heads have been
recognized upon sight the finished head is called
a tsanta obviously this process does not sug-
gest a power of shrinking bones since they are
carefully removed therefore the amazing thing
that sheila and ray are witnessing here is a matter
for some thought scientists have never found any
instance of the power to shrink bone among the
head-hunter tribes however the jivaro tribes
have a legend of a supreme hunter among their
race who once was able to shrink the heads of his
enemies while alive whether or not this is pure
fantasy does not seem to take much debate yet
many strange things have come out of south
american jungles-ed

there-he motioned eastward toward
the mighty amazons headwaters-
theres a tribe that has the secret of
shrinking not only skin but bones

  what thats got to do with lubeck
i dont know nothing maybe prob-
ably he and feinkell are after some-
thing entirely different but whatever
it is im willing to bet its in the domain
of the tribe that shrunk this skull

  then    what do we do ray
sheila was a little breathless

  the intense brown eyes pierced her
dark ones

  we go there too little lady where-
ever lubeck goes we follow until we
nail him or he gets us

  the girl considered how do we
know where to go

  again ray paced the floor right
now frankly we dont but tomorrow
im going to visit every curio shop and
trading company in quito with this
head and try to find where it came
from

  but at one establishment after an-
other the young american met with
interest-and failure

  no senor never before have i seen
such a head one aged dealer com-
mented in an answer typical of all the
others as a muchacho i lived among
the caucheros-the rubber gatherers
across the andes but even that was
too tame for me i was adventurous
i left the caucheros went alone into
the country of los infieles-thus we
called the head-hunters in those days-
far above the great pongo de manseri-
che canyon

  i visited them all-the antipas the
aguarunas the zaparos the huambi-
sas the patucas every tribe of the
jivaros but never did i see a head
like this one he shook his own gray
head slowly no senor none like
this

  strain showed in rays lean brown

face then you dont know of any-
one who could help me no one who
might be able to give me a lead

  for a long moment the old man hesi-
tated

  there is a man senor he said at
last he has been even farther be-
yond the pongo de manseriche than i
he is muy malo though-a bad man
he was guide to a nazi herr feinkell
who-

tceinkell

       ray spat out the name in sheer
amazement

  yes it is bad that ecuador should
have allowed such a nazi dog to come
here-

  yes yes but where do i find this
man you speak of

  the old man gave him an address
far out on the citys edge he is an
hombre malo- he warned

  but the young american was too
eager to listen more with hurried
thanks he rushed away

  the home of the man he and sheila
sought was a flimsy hovel far distant
from all other habitation the tropical
dusk already was falling fast rays
nose wrinkled as they approached the
ramshackle dwelling

  smells like a garbage dump he
snorted

  sheila allowed herself a little giggle
what a romantic scene for a murder

  even as she spoke a slovenly figure
appeared at the shantys door

  were looking for a man named
ponciano corral ray called does
he live here

  the man in the doorway eyed them
suspiciously

  wat you want eh

  the young american stepped for-
ward i hear youve been into the
jivaro country he explained

  si i bin there

  wed like to talk to you about it

  the man hesitated then awright
you come in

  the smell inside the shanty was even
worse than that without everything
was in complete disorder a small kit-
ten was eating the remain of its masters
meal from a plate on the rooms lone
table it was on a chain their host-
revealed in the uncertain flickerings of
a kerosene lamp as a greasy overfat
man with shifty eyes-cuffed it to the
floor and sat down on the edge of the
table himself

  awright wat you want

  ray reached into his pocket dumped
the shrunken head out onto the table
ever seen one of these before

  the ecuadorian glanced briefly at
the shriveled hideous thing he nodded
si i see lots of em

  where

  a crafty light came into the others
eyes he looked from ray to sheila
and back again and licked his thick
lips

  how much you pay me to tell you
eh

  it was an ancient hold-up game the
lean young american had played it be-
fore

  tell us first then well decide how
much its worth he haggled

orral smiled greasily he swung
the kitten back up onto the table
by the chain shes nice country he
commented but far far from here
he stroked the kittens ears pepe
come from there-no es verdad pepito

  maybe you like to look at pepe
eh he swung the kitten toward
them ray caught it the next in-
stant his jaw dropped

  an ocelot

  si senor corrall nodded an
only seex seven inches long were
you see ocelot like that eh even


fantastic adventures

leetle ocelot in jungles three feet long
he grinned slyly don you theenk
map to place he come from ees worth
mucho dinero

  but his question went unanswered-
forever

  crack

  it was the sharp report of a high-
powered gun a surprised expression
struck corrals face his mouth fell
open

  ray dived for the lamp in a head-
long lunge he sent it spinning against
the wall with a tinkle of shattering
glass

  sheila down he roared

  like a row of exclafnation points
came the chat-chat-chat-chat of a ma-
chine gun bullets tspd through the
hovels flimsy walls

  sheila are you all right

  back came the girls frightened
voice yes im all right only im
scared whats happening

  after the first burst of fire came
silence ray crawled to the doorway
his own colt army automatic ready
near him the grass outside rustled

  the colt in his hand bucked and
roared for an instant he thought he
caught the sound of retreating foot-
steps then against the skyline he
glimpsed the silhouettes of retreating
figures

  whats happening sheila re-
peated again her voice pulled down to
a whisper

  her companions brown eyes were
gleaming the lean jaw was hard

  we broke up a little assassination
party he explained in a low tone

 but who-

  all things considered id say it was
lubeck himself he carries a military
mauser and theyre equipped with a
special holster-stock so you can use em
as a machine gun

  and    corral   

  ray wormed his way over to the
fallen ecuadorian he felt for a pulse
found none

  hes dead he reported grimly as
we would be too by now if my colt
hadnt scared those devils off he
moved over next to the girl she clung
to his arm

  what do we do now she asked

  the lean young officer sat for a long
moment in silence there in the pitch-
blackness of the shanty

  i guess we start over he said at
last there was a note of bitterness in
his voice it looks like our lucks run
out

chapter v

adventure in iquitos

just how thoroughly the fickle god-
dess of fortune had deserted them
they did not realize until the next
morning when a heavy and official-
sounding knock sounded on their suites
door with a queer premonition of dif-
ficulties to come ray crossed the room
to open it he found two ponderous
individuals-one of them wearing the
uniform of an ecuadorian police
sergeant-waiting in the hall

  yes

  the plainclothesman in the lead
smiled unpleasantly

  it is our misfortune to be forced to
bother you with a few questions he
apologized ornately

  we shall take but a few moments
of the senors valuable time however
chimed in the uniformed sergeant

  if we might be allowed to enter the
norte americanos quarters- hinted
number one

  the intelligence man moved aside
gestured them in

  what can i do for you

  the ecuadorian plainclothesman
drummers of daugavo



bowed low to sheila before replying
then he said it is with the sorrow
that i tell you senor a countryman of
mine-a worthless perro ponciano
corral-was killed last night

  thats too bad rays tone and
facial expression implied that he
couldnt quite see how this concerned
him

  yes the ecuadorian nodded of
course senor it is all a mistake but
we have been informed that last night
you and your senora visited this man

  so

  until the matter is cleared up
senor we must place you in-how you
say-protective custody

  i see ray glanced across to sheila
anxiety filled her eyes they questioned
him as to the next move

  but it would be most inconvenient
gentlemen he protested surely you
can release us on our own recogni-
zance-

  the ecuadorian spread his hands in
a gesture of helplessness i am dev-
astated senor i of course can per-
ceive instantly that it would have been
impossible for such as you and the
senora to have any connection with such
a miserable business but my superiors
- he shrugged his despair

  ray was not deceived behind this
latin americans mask of politeness
was a competent and determined police
official who wasnt going to be stalled
off by any excuse or ruse

  very well gentlemen well come
with you his lean brown face grim
the american stepped across the room
got his hat and a trench coat from the
closet his mind was working at top
speed

  obviously this was more of konrad
lubecks work the nazi was deter-
mined to delay pursuit and certainly
this trick would take ray and sheila

out of the running indefinitely

  but why

rjphe question seared itself into the
young officers brain in indelible
letters why should the german have
left his usual work of sabotage and
espionage for south america why
should he be willing to go to such ends
what was the goal which lured him
where would the trail lead next and
what was the link that tied together
the jumbled parts of this strange jig-
saw puzzle into a coherent whole
how could such diverse clues as fein-
kell the nazi explorer-lubeck the
spy-the shrunken head-the tiny
dwarfed ocelot-be parts of the same
pattern

  most important of all what should
he and sheila do now they were
strangers in a strange land because
they had fled the united states as fu-
gitives from the law they dared not
appeal to the american consular offi-
cials for help in fighting the murder
charge which ray now felt confident
eventually would be filed against them
for corrals death for no doubt lu-
beck had framed them with his usual
diabolic skill

  once again the grim realization of
duty drove itself home konrad lu-
beck would never be here unless it was
essential to germanys welfare-and
the united states injury

  rays lips were a grim thin line
to hell with everything else lubeck
must be checkmated regardless of con-
sequences

  he slapped on his hat turned back
toward the ecuadorians stretching
out one arm he started to put on the
coat

  then so fast that the eye could
hardly follow the motion he hurled the
outspread garment over the head of
the uniformed man


fantastic adventures

  almost as a continuation of the same
motion his fist came over in a looping
right that caught the plainclothesman
in the nose his left slashed out in a
savage uppercut to the mans jaw the
ecuadorian went down and out

  ray sprang at the still-entangled
uniformed officer his fists drove out
in piston-like blows the latin amer-
ican crumpled under the assault
quick cords

  sheila went into action with speed
and efficiency she ripped towels into
narrow strips in less than two min-
utes the ecuadorians were tightly
bound and gagged the lean young
officer sprang to his feet

  ray there was the slightest
note of panic in the girls voice what
now where can we go

  her companion shot her a grim smile
we run for it thats all we can do
come on

tn half an hour they were at quitos
airport negotiating with the amer-
ican who ran a charter transport service
from ecuadors capital to all other
south american points

  the veteran flyer shook his head at
rays first question cant set a plane
down at barrancas he explained no
field thats worth the name closest i
could take you would be iquitos
iquitos it is then ray decided
when can we leave

  right now ive got an old fokker
thats all ready to go the flyer eyed
the two with interest say whats
going on over there anyhow youre
the second party in less than  hours
to want to go to barrancas

  the second

  yeah three guys came in this
morning early i sent them through to
iquitos too

 lubeck choked ray then
one man short and fat one stocky

and one tall and thin as a rail
yeah thats the bunch friends
of yours

  the intelligence man relaxed the
grip of jubilation he had taken on
sheilas hand no not friends just
-acquaintances he helped the girl
into the fokker

  the andes rose before them then
fell away again the bright vivid
green of tropical jungles replaced the
more subdued coloration of the uplands
below them they caught glints of the
yellow turbid beginnings of the ama-
zon mightiest of rivers

  sheila sat close beside ray in the
big bare cabin-often used for carry-
ing freight instead of passengers-of
the fokker while its pilot guided it
steadily onward through the mountains
treacherous air currents

when we get to iquitos ray-
he pressed her hand but his lean
features remained somber we try
again he said maybe lubeck will
still be there-

  but most of the trip they sat in taut
nerve-shredding silence itching the
wild country of the ecuadorian-brazil-
ian frontier unroll beneath them

  then they were coming down to a
landing on a barren little field hacked
from the living jungle itself lying close
to a rambling tropic town

  iquitos their pilot shouted above
the fokkers roar

  another plane stood near one edge
of the field

  that the ship that brought in the
other party ray demanded

  no thats gone back the one
over there is the mail plane theyve
got regular service in here now

  with that they landed men came
running toward them across the field
several were in uniform

  together the two young americans
swung out of the ship
drummers of daugavo



  the man in the lead of the group
running toward the plane stopped short
he leveled a quivering forefinger at the
pair

  there he is he cried in the bas-
tard portuguese of brazils back coun-
try arrest him

tefore ray and sheila could so
much as realize what he was say-
ing the mans uniformed companions
swooped down and seized them there
was a moment of frantic struggle
then realizing force could avail them
nothing the americans relaxed

  and what might this mean scnor
ray demanded his brown face flushed
with anger

  still aflutter with excitement the
dark-faced man who had pointed them
out could hardly hold himself in one
spot long enough to answer

  you are captain raymond hol-
comb he cried accusingly

  his manner set warning signals
flashing in the young officers brain
what are you talking about he de-
manded angrily as he did so he
stepped forward simultaneously shov-
ing sheila backward so hard that she
would have fallen had not one of the
brazilians sprung forward to catch her

  well he demanded aggressively
whats it about hurry up

  the brazilian jittered nervously
all eyes were centered on him and the
intelligence man a fact which ray
noted with satisfaction for in the
excitement of his sudden move no one
had caught onto the fact that in shov-
ing sheila out of the way he also had
shoved the wallet in which he carried
his identification papers under the
girls coat

  but    senor    are you not
captain raymond holcomb    

  now a burly figure with heavy jowls
and a military pompadour elbowed his

way forward

  uff course this iss der man dum-
kopj he snarled in a thickly teutonic
accent

  the mans appearance and speech
cued rays next words

  the devil im captain raymond
holcomb im a mining engineer not
a soldier-

  the man with the pompadour glow-
ered uff course hell lie he grunted
didnt der message say he vas tricky
si si that is so

  hold for what ray demanded
what are you talking about

  the brazilian squirmed uncertainly
caught in a quandary

  this very day senor your war
department at washington cabled our
state department at rio de janeiro
it was asked that you be arrested as a
suspected spy in the interests of pan
american solidarity our government
then radioed me and so i now have
arrested you-

  only im not the right man my
names joe murray he turned
here sheila wheres our passports
instantly the girl opened nr hand-
bag she made a great show of search-
ing through it finally she closed it
again and stood in silence staring at
her own feet

  well where are they

  oh joe- her acting was superb
she gave the impression that she was
on the verge of tears

  whats the matter

 joe-i-i-im afraid i forgot
them   

  forgot them

the girl sniveled convincingly

they were right on the dresser
there in quito and i forgot all about
them and walked off and left them-
oh you simple-minded dope look
what a jam youve put us in well


fantastic adventures

never be able to convince these guys
now my lord sheila-

  the brazilian official shifted uneas-
ily from one foot to another while ray
continued to denounce the girl savagely
and she to cry

  perhaps the mistake der is inter-
rupted the burly individual with the
german accent

  sure its a mistake all right
agreed ray heatedly but what i want
to know is what are we going to do
about it-

  oh dot iss all simple   

 huh

  you see  if der passports were
left on der dresser they vill be found
und all dot iss necessary iss dot a
radiogram be sent to quito until
then you should not object to der for-
mality uff arrest und der lady uff
course vill not be held i mineself
-he bowed ingratiatingly-vill see
dot she hass der best quarters in der
hotel

  the brazilian official beamed

  si si that is the solution senor
he cried happily

  ray fumbled for an answer to that
but could find none

  all right he growled at last if
thats how you want it i suppose thats
how itll have to be

  and still grumbling he was led away
through the run-down streets of iquitos
to the local calabozo

  the cell assigned the lean young
officer was better than the average in
that it was at least above ground but
vermin infested it along with all the
others and the bars in the windows
sadly spoiled the view

  nerves jagged with worry he paced
the floor

  its easy enough to see what hap-
pened he told himself grimly lu-
beck wasnt taking any chances damn
him he knew i was wanted back in

the states so he must have cabled the
war department that i was around
iquitos then the local nazi stooge
was assigned to see that nothing mis-
fired

  inaction was driving him frantic he
gripped the bars of the door tried to
shake them but they would not budge
he turned to the windows there
again the iron was set deep in the rock
walls

  anything to break the monotony of
this awful waiting ray searched
through the room with a fine-tooth
comb hunting for some way-any way
-to escape

  by morning at the latest theyll
know that gag about the lost passports
is-just a gag he muttered the
brazilian government will ship me
back ill be tried for desertion-
treason maybe   

  but his frantic searching availed him
nothing there was nothing that of-
fered the remotest chance of a way
out even the furniture such as it
was was entirely of wood

drown eyes like live coals the lean
bronzed officer stared out across
iquitos dim in the dusk it was a
strange place a sort of tropic ghost
town for the decline of south amer-
icas rubber industry had cut its popu-
lation to less than  leaving hun-
dreds of its ramshackle houses to de-
cay and acres of the city to return to
a green wilderness of jungle

  ssst joe

  ray jumped at the sound of the voice
as if he had been stabbed he spun
about

  sheila

  the girl stood close outside the cell
door with her was the burly german
who had been so insistent on rays
arrest she shot the lean young officer
a broad wink
drummers of daugavo



  joe herr heinlein here didnt
know we too are of the gestapo
she spoke in german with an ef-
fort ray veiled his bewilderment

  why didnt he did those dum-
kopjs of the courier service bungle
things again the intelligence man
replied in the same language

  yes the fools must never have
gotten the message through to lubeck
my god hitler will be furious
where is lubeck now

  he left for the interior at once
well have to follow hurry up
get me out of here

  the man with the pompadour gulped
hard

  i cant do it its only because one
of our men is a jailer that i was able
to arrange this visit

  you got me in here didnt you you
fool raged ray now get me out
then

  have you got a gun

  yes here the german handed
over a big luger

  good ray gripped it firmly
now ill tell you how to get us out
he motioned the nazi closer do you
see that light he pointed to a vague
pinpoint of yellow gleaming in the trop-
ic night outside his cell window

  ja the other nodded staring in-
tently at it

  the american slashed through be-
tween the doors bars with the lugers
barrel it struck the man called hein-
lein full on the top of the head the
breath went out of him in a sort of
sighing groan he collapsed on the
stone floor

  oh ray

  sheila flung herself against the bars
sobbing her arms embraced the lean
young officer

  good girl he soothed caressing
her hair gently but dont let down
yet youve got to get me out of here

what do you want me to do
drag heinlein over to where the
door will hide him when its open
then call that nazi jailer in here
and get out of the way yourself

  in less than a minute the jailer
rushed in

  hold it ray rapped he sighted
the luger straight on the mans mid-
riff unlock this door or youre as
good as dead

 the mans eyes went wide he
glanced around wildly but-herr
heinlein- he gasped

  herr heinleins out of circulation
come over here

  nein

  whirling the man lunged for the
door

  stop

  the man paid no heed

  sweat stood out on rays forehead
he saw their lone chance of escape get-
ting away yet he could not shoot a
brazilian peace officer

  then a phrase of heinleins flashed
through his brain its only because
one of our men is a jailer that i was
able to arrange this visit

  brazilian peace officer this man
might be but he also was a traitor

  tight-lipped ray squeezed the trig-
ger

chapter vi

jivaro country

jn the echo-filled second that followed
the shot the jailer pitched to the
floor ray glimpsed sheila backed
against the corridor wall her lovely
face distraught with horror heinlein
lay still behind the door completely
unconscious

  sheila hurry ray clipped
quick the key

  the sound of his voice seemed to


fantastic adventures

break the spell that gripped her she
dropped to her knees beside the dead
man rolling him over she snatched
up his key-ring and ran back to the in-
telligence man a moment later they
swung the cell door open and raced
down the corridor

  ray where are we going

  after lubeck

 but-how-

  lookout rays arm caught her
jerked her aside into another passage
just as a door at the end of the corridor
they had been traversing burst open
belching in half a dozen armed brazil-
ian officers attracted by the lugers
shot

  this way

  together the young americans
speeded away from the new menace
they rounded a turn a door loomed
ahead behind them shouts in portu-
guese told them their ruse had been
discovered

  ray hurled himself at the door its
massive panels did not budge

  snarling a curse he backed away
poured four shots into the lock so fast
they sounded like a machine guns
chatter again he hurled himself against
the stubborn portal

  it shoved open just as the brazilians
rounded the corner behind them a
volley of shots shredded the air about
the americans they lunged on out and
across the street onto which the door
opened

  a car was passing ray leaped to its
running board he rammed the lugers
hot snout into the drivers ribs sheila
sprang up behind him

  drive ray roared

  the language was unfamiliar but the
meaning was crystal clear the man
jammed the gas pedal to the floor the
car leaped forward

  more shots whistled by but none
struck home the car rounded a corner

  alto ray shouted

  their driver jammed on the brakes
the lean young officer jerked him from
the car jumped into the drivers seat
himself and they were off again

  sheila gripped his arm

  ray where are we going

  the airfield

  the airfield

  sure its our only chance

 but what-

  youll see

pive more minutes of breath-taking
speed and hair-breadth escapes and
they were at the edge of the landing
port ray did not even slow down
driving with the skill of a professional
racer and the daring of a madman he
whipped the car past startled gaping
guards and on straight across the field
when finally he braked the vehicle
they were in the shadow of the mail
plane

 come on he helped sheila
aboard then glanced at the panel
praise be its got a starter

  he scrambled in beside her turned
on the motor bullets whistled about
them as they taxied down the field for
the take-off

  sheila stared at him wide-eyed

  i didnt know you could fly she
said

  i started out in the air corps ray
explained grinning

  there was a moment of tension as
they cleared the dense jungle that
rimmed the field then they were
climbing and finally straightening out
on a course

  at last ray leaned back

  now he commanded tell me
what kind of witchcraft you used to
get herr heinlein to come visit me
and to convince him we were good
nazis

  sheila too relaxed she tucked her
drummers of daugavo



feet under her leaned her head on the
others shoulder and let her lips go in
a curve that was more grin than smile

  you wont believe it she warned
it just doesnt seem possible that any
part of the fabulously efficient nazi ma-
chine could be as stupid as that man
heinlein

  ray eyed her howd you work it
whats the secret

  i spoke german

  huh

  honestly at first i didnt think of
it as a trick it was just that heinleins
english was so thick and bad that i
couldnt stand it so i switched to ger-
man

  then what

her eyes sparkled with merriment
he stared at me like id stuck a pin
in him then very suspiciously indeed
he said fraulein i thought you were
american 

  when he said that i took the cue
and got furiously angry i told him
what a fool he was and how we were
the gestapos prize agents i claimed
that ray holcomb was in jail in ecua-
dor and that you and i had been sent
out here to help lubeck i called him
all the names i could think of in ger-
man and i swore the headsman would
get him for his blunder before i fin-
ished he actually was begging me to
put in a good word for him at berlin
ray laughed lady youre a won-
der any woman who can vamp any-
thing as cold-blooded as a nazi is a
phenomenon

  sheila snuggled closer well she
admitted he did keep licking his lips
all the time i was talking to him
then what do we do now

  the old intense flame again lit up
in her companions eyes

we steal a march on herr lubeck
he said grimly hell be expecting us
to follow him if anything instead

well fly on ahead up into the jivaro
country beyond the pongo de man-
seriche rapids we can wait for him
there

awn s gray light revealed a great
canyon far below them with a
river gushing between thousand-foot
walls of living rock

  the santiago cried ray that
canyon must be the pongo de manseri-
che itself

  it was at that moment that the en-
gine began to sputter rays eyes
scanned the instrument board

  out of gas

  oh ray anxiety shone in shei-
las dark eyes the young officer patted
her knee

  its ok youngster i think we can
glide in from here weve got plenty
of altitude

  slowly they drifted earthward with
ray taking advantage of every updraft

  the sputtering ceased and the engine
died completely the plane began to
lose altitude more rapidly worry
shadowed rays face he hunched for-
ward in his seat as if trying to force the
ship onward by sheer will-power

  the great rock walls of the pongo de
manseriche rushed upward toward
them the canyon seemed to extend
onward endlessly

  the couple in the plane could see
details now crevices and jagged
spikes of stone poised like spears to
receive them

  can we make it ray

  the intelligence mans teeth were
clenched with tension maybe but
im beginning to doubt it

  lower lower lower down to-
ward the cruel hard rock

  here it comes  ray choked

  then suddenly the canyon walls
seemed to spread out the river grew
wider the pilot shot it a glance the


fantastic adventures

next instant he was leaning hard on the
stick

  wish me luck sheila he breathed
between dry lips that canyon looks
wide enough here to take our wing-
spread im going to try dropping into
it itll give us a couple of minutes
more before we crash

  the old mail plane hovered above
the canyon itself a moment later it
plummeted sickeningly

  ray it was a little cry of fear

  that waters cold it makes a down-
draft

  with infinite skill ray leveled off
but the water was speeding closer sec-
ond by second

  well lady i guess this is it-

  and then like a miracle the walls
were vanishing they were out of the
canyon-out into  a strange upland
country ahead of them a village of
mud-and-bamboo shacks loomed just
off the santiagos sandy beach

 ray were through sheila
gripped the lean young officers arm in
excitement

ter companion did not answer he
was swinging the plane toward
land and the village but they were
only a few feet above the water now

  he shoved forward on the stick they
rushed down faster and faster then
as they gained speed he brought it
back they cleared the bank by inches

  but the climb was too steep to main-
tain the ship stalled and because
they were so close to the ground they
came down flat in what was almost a
pancake landing uninjured

  already the chocolate figures of na-
tives from the village were darting to-
ward them taking advantage of every
scrap of cover to the point that only
rarely were they visible

  ray scrambled atop the plane and
lifted his arms in a gesture of peace

  friend friend he cried in the
quichua dialect that serves as the es-
peranto of nearly every tribe of the
interior

  slowly the natives came out of hid-
ing their deadly -foot blowguns in
hand they stared warily at the two
americans held many undertoned dis-
cussions with each other then at last
a woman came forward she carried a
gourd bowl in her hands

  giamanchi ray explained over his
shoulder to sheila its food and
theyre offering it to us theyve de-
cided to play it our way and be friends

  for a month the pair lived withthe
tribe they were antipas-a branch
of the jivaro group and despite their
head-hunting proclivities they proved
to be a kindly and friendly people with
their aid ray camouflaged the mail
plane with branches in preparation for
the day when lubecks party finally
would come up the santiago-or as
these indians called it the paute

  and then at last they came

  they were in a canoe all three of
them-feinkell the gaunt explorer-
scientist krag the roly-poly stooge
and konrad lubeck himself

  they did not even pause at the anti-
pas village on they went on up the
river into the country of other tribes
and close on their heels with half a
dozen friendly jivaros as guides came
ray and sheila

  day after day they traveled onward
in the land of the zaparos they left
the santiago for a tributary a stream
that wound back deep into savage bad-
lands of eroded stone

  it was that night that the americans
first heard the drums

  all night long they throbbed beat-
ing out a cadence that sent chills up
and down the whites spines at the
sound ray turned to the antipas chief
who accompanied them
drummers of daugavo



  what tribes drums are those that
beat beyond us he demanded in the
strange jargon of the jivaros

  the chief muttered something be-
neath his breath he would not meet
the lean young officers eyes

  what tribe are they ray re-
peated

  no tribe supais drums

  supai sheila looked at ray
what tribe is that

  the others face was puzzled i
dont get it he admitted supai is
supposed to be a semi-inca god the
evil one their devil so to speak but
hes not a jivaro god ive never heard
them speak of him before

e turned back to the chief

how many days march are we
from the drums

  a thousand moons we never reach
them they are supais drums they
beat you hear but you never find
ray eyed him well see about that
lubecks going toward those drums
and were following

  no the antipas chief sprang to
his feet

  what do you mean

  we no go farther supai kill us all
we turn back here

  even by the firelight in the tropic
night ray could see the stark terror
in the indians eyes

  ok he said at last despairing of
reasoning with the man for now well
talk about it in the morning

  in tense silence the little party
bedded down they fell asleep with
the beating of those distant drums still
throbbing in their brains

  rubbing the sleep from his eyes ray
staggered to his feet with the dawn
the morning was clear and cool
chief he called

  there was no answer

  instantly the bronzed officer was

wide awake

  hey he shouted he ran toward
the spot where the canoes were
beached

  only one was there

  pell-mell he raced back to the camp
sheila aroused by his yells was sitting
up her eyes still bleary with sleep

  what is it ray she yawned
making an effort to smooth her dark
hair

  the antipas theyre gone

  gone 

  yes damn em that chief wasnt
kidding last night he and his men
have pulled out

  then    what    

  ray sat down beside her i wish
i knew sheila a frown wrinkled his
tanned forehead actually i guess
theres nothing left for us to go on

  ray she touched his hand

  yes

  ray im scared

  what of

  those drums ray and that supai
the natives    they were really afraid
of something  

  her companion flashed her a grin
full of a confidence he did not feel
forget it youngster those jivaros
were a superstitious bunch theyd be
frightened of their own shadows he
got to his feet time we got moving
we cant afford to fall too far behind
lubeck

t y day they traveled and by night
they slept and each night the
sound of distant drums grew louder  
louder    louder until they seemed
like the beat of a monstrous malignant
heart the very soul of this wilderness
of stone and silences

  there was no vegetation here no
animal life of any kind either not
even buzzards to circle overhead the
stream up which they paddled flowed


fantastic adventures

through narrow canyons miniatures of
the great pongo de manseriche but
here even the rock was different-col-
ored in a thousand fantastic shadings
as if a mad painter had let his imagi-
nation run riot

  a week now they had been in the
badlands

  the foods nearly gone sheila said
dully as they beached the canoe on a
narrow strip of sand just before sun-
down her dark eyes were lacklus-
terous and weary from strain

  ray nodded yes tomorrow well
finish it

  then as they stood there the sun
dropped from sight the sudden dusk
of the tropics was upon them

  and as if at a signal again they
heard the drums

 boom boom boom boom
boom boom

with a shrill cry the girl cracked
stop it she screamed i cant
stand it theyre driving me mad ray
ray dont let them stop them
ohhh  

  the bronzed intelligence man sprang
to her side his arms embraced her

  dont sheila dont let go he
begged were nearly there now
weve got to keep our nerve we can
do it feinkell made this trip before
and corral we can too-

  but the drums she moaned limp
in his arms all night they beat but
we never reach them no sound could
carry as far as weve come ray its
not a sound i know it isnt its some-
thing in our brains-

  sheila darling he soothed desper-
ately youre unstrung youre let-
ting it get you down dont fight it
just accept it-

  i cant i cant she was sobbing
spasmodically her head buried against
his shoulder i know its in our brains
ive tried covering my ears-plugging

them-but it goes on beating all night
long it seems as if the whole world
were shrinking as if the canyon walls
were falling in on us as if the sky was
coming down my skin feels too tight
its shrinking too cant you under-
stand ray-

  the lean officer caught her shoulder
in a grip of iron

  of course i understand damn it
he slashed back fiercely dont you
think im human too dont you think
my head is splitting my nerves torn
apart

  i know we havent the chance of
rats in a whirlpool but sheila we cant
crack we cant

  i know youre right what we hear
isnt just a sound somehow its a
psychic beat broadcast into our brains
my skin is tight too i feel like i was
being squeezed to death maybe its
physical maybe mental i dont know
i think of that head i found in the
trash can-shrunken skin and bone
alike-and i nearly go crazy

  then lets go back  the girl sobbed
lets get in the canoe right now we
can paddle all night and all tomorrow
and on and on and on i can stand
anything but staying here-

  the racks tortures could not have
contorted rays lean face more sheila
girl he whispered hoarsely my god
i wish we could go back   

  she raised her head looked into his
burning brown eyes

  dont you see he asked we
cant go back lubecks enduring the
same tortures we are but hes going on
that means hes playing for stakes so
big hell even risk madness to win

  lubecks first of all a nazi a
fanatic a man willing to die for ger-
many the only thing hed come here
for would be something tremendously
important to the axis

  thats where we come in for amer-
drummers of daugavo



icas sake weve got to stop him-

  sheila was still looking at him but
suddenly horror-living immediate
fear-sprang into her eyes

  ray look out

  as a rattler strikes ray spun about

  there close behind him stood a
woman the strangest woman he had
ever seen and the biggest-she was
easily six feet six

  she was stark naked save for a
breech-clout dark she was like an
indian but there was none of the
savages simplicity and childishness
about her every line from the erect
stance itself to the flashing eyes and
the proud up-pointed breasts bespoke
imperiousness thick black hair
crowned her head in her hand she held
one of the strange force-ray pistols that
krag had carried that long-ago day
when he and lubeck surprised ray and
chick williams

  instinctively the officer fell back a
step

  what- he choked

  the woman pulled the pistols trig-
ger the american felt himself lurch
backward the ground was coming up
to meet him he barely heard sheila
scream again

lubeck grinned wickedly down at him

  welcome to the land of the dau-
gavos captain holcomb the nazi
cried mockingly your persistence is
rewarded you have achieved your
goal you have caught up with me

  at least retorted the american
you couldnt capture me yourself you
had to have a woman help you his
tone was as flippant as lubecks but
his brown eyes were smouldering

  lubeck chuckled ah you dont
understand my dear captain he cried
this is a land of women of veritable
amazons in fact

  yes ray nodded with a cheerful-
ness he did not feel that specimen
who hit me last night certainly was an
amazon he started to sit up only
to realize that he was firmly bound

  but she didnt hit you lubeck
contradicted eyes dancing he squatted
down beside the prisoner by no means
did she hit you

  what do you mean i certainly
was knocked out

  oh certainly the nazi nodded
his agreement but no blow was
struck youll find no bruises any-
where on your body

  but i was knocked out-

  yes you were rendered uncon-
scious by a technique unknown any-
where but here you were struck down
by a force ray i might even mention
that one of my most important reasons
for coming here was to obtain the secret
of the weapon for the third reich and
its allies

  the mention of the germans mis-
sion snapped ray alert if youve got
no better way of passing the time you
might tell me about it he remarked
hoping his words and tone were just
caustic enough to taunt the nazi into
further explanation

  of course captain thats why im
paying you this visit to explain to you
in detail just how disastrous your fail-
ure to stop me will prove to your coun-
try he chuckled leaned his stocky
form back against a post

  ill begin at the beginning for your
benefit captain lubeck went on his


fantastic adventures

voice brimming with vicious good
humor my story starts several months
ago when professor feinkell one of
germanys lesser scientists reported he
had made discoveries in this area which
he believed would be useful to us

  i was assigned to investigate and
eventually i met feinkell in chicago
ray nodded thats where i picked
you up

correct at the time i was most
disturbed about the whole affair it all
worked out rather badly however-
what about the janitor ray in-
terrupted why was he killed

jphe nazi agent lit a cigarette he
was a fool a soft-hearted simple-
minded fool after wed fooled your
agent by blowing dust all over our
apartment with a vacuum cleaner and
pretending to be the occupants cf the
one next door i saw that he would talk
under police grilling so it became neces-
sary to    eliminate him

  ray could not hide the living hatred
in his eyes

  at first lubeck continued i was
rather worried over your-may i coin a
term-escapability now of course
im rather pleased to have you in at
the finish

  i can imagine

  from beginning to end however
my dear captain your adaptability and
daring astounded me i had never con-
ceived it possible for an american agent
to forget the rules and play a rough-
and-tumble game the way you have
done

  cheer up grunted the lean young
officer under his breath you and
hitler have a lot to learn about just
how rough our side can play when we
get started

  in quito i realized that sooner or
later you would contact corral so he
also was eliminated a telephone call

to the police-

  ray sighed wearily thats all past
history lubeck i thought you were
going to tell me what you came for
dont be impatient young man
the german chuckled youll find out
soon enough too soon from your
point of view then at any rate
we came on up the amazon and the
santiago of course we never were
under any illusions as to where you
and the young fraulein were we re-
ceived a short-wave radio report of
your theft of the mail plane within
minutes after you took off knowing
the way your mind functions i at once
surmised that you would lie in wait
for us then follow to see where we were
going so my first move on arriving
here in daugavo was to order an am-
bush he drew a final lungful of
smoke from his cigarette and snapped
the butt away

  all this cleverness of yours no
doubt will sound fine in your report to
the wilheunstrasse said ray but
its boring me stiff hurry up

 tsk tsk such an impatient
young man

  there was something about the bub-
bling good nature with which the nazi
made the remark that made the amer-
icans blood run cold despite the warm
sun

  you were captured with the force
ray lubeck went on slowly it is a
remarkable example of primitive scien-
tific achievement how it works i do
not know in fact the discovery of its
principle is one of my main objectives

  however it consists of a crude pis-
tol in which a lump of a substance
manufactured by the daugavo witch-
doctors is placed a sort of shutter
arrangement is connected with the
trigger allowing the rays which evi-
dently emanate from that lump to play
on any form of animal life no matter
drummers of daugavo



how briefly immediately stuns its vic-
tim yet no permanent harm is done
the witch-doctors undoubtedly are
selling you the secret for a handful of
beads and two pocket mirrors ray
commented sarcastically

  no lubeck shook his head his
blue-grey eyes were dreamy no
captain holcomb from the start that
was the difficulty the witch-doctors
would not sell the secret they gave
feinkell one of the pistols after much
persuasion but they refused to reveal
the sacred rites by which the substance
was produced

  then howll you get the secret
the nazi smiled coldly i have
never found a situation with which i
could not cope captain i shall show
you how i shall solve this one
rising to his feet he walked swiftly
away in five minutes he was back

  a woman walked beside him her
head towering above his like the
creature ray had seen the night be-
fore she was unclothed but for a
breech-cloth she had the same pride-
ful almost haughty air one of the
strange force-ray pistols was slung at
her side

  lubecks cold eyes were gleaming
with triumph

  this is tigora queen of all the
daugavos he told ray

jphe lean young officers face was
puzzled go ahead from there
he proposed

  it is simple shrugged the nazi
tigora is a queen yet she is also a
woman i shall make her love me
the americans eyes narrowed
how about her current husband
these people are not like the jiva-
ros lubeck retorted here the
women rule he turned hi it
was a command

  seconds later a man stumbled up to

the german he was inches shorter
than the woman his body was gaunt
and emaciated and scarred with
wounds

  yet most remarkable of all were his
eyes for they were exactly the re-
verse of the womans instead of be-
ing fiery and full of pride they were
dull lifeless without the faintest touch
of sparkle

  you see chuckled lubeck he
is like a serf-his spirit is broken by a
thousand years of obedience to wom-
ans slightest whim

  here there is no marriage only
a polyandrous relationship in which
these poor sticks of men are doled out
for breeding purposes the rest of the
time they work as slaves

  in that case said ray i dont
see where you come in

  again the nazi chuckled after
generations of such creatures as these
cant you imagine the desirability of a
civilized man like me tigora as
queen also is chief witch-doctor once
i have aroused her emotions she will
reveal everything

  and freda your wife jibed the
american no doubt she will under-
stand and appreciate your situation
do you think shell like your playing
stud to this amazon

  a brief flicker of worry flashed across
the others face for a moment he
stood silent then i cant allow any
womans emotions-not even my wifes
-to stand in the way of my duty to
the reich freda will have to adjust
herself to reality

  tigora interrupted she tugged at
lubecks arm and she spoke unintel-
ligible syllables to him in a voice as
deep as any stevedores but her eyes
were fond and warm

  hah cried the nazi agent he
winked broadly at the bound and help-
less ray already this tigora begins


fantastic adventures

to appreciate me she wants me to go
with her to visit her subordinates the
lesser witch-doctors wish me luck
dear captain for the axis sake

  with a mocking salute and a laugh
of triumph he strode away at the tall
queens side

  but lubeck would have been sur-
prised-yes and worried too-had he
glanced back all through his conver-
sation with ray the latters face had
been disconsolate but now that help-
less look was gone it had been re-
placed by a queer grim smile-the
smile of a poker player in a no-limit
game whose hand is a royal flush

jhe lean young officer lay quiet un-
til lubeck and queen tigora were
out of sight then he began straining
at his bonds

  you can get out of anything if you
try hard enough and long enough he
muttered to himself flexing his wrists
against the cords which bound them

  it took him two hours and he judged
by the sun that it was past noon before
he was at last free wearily he sat
up rubbing his raw aching wrists to
restore circulation

  from this position he could look out
over the daugavo town it was much
like the villages of the jivaros in that
the buildings were of bamboo-and-mud
construction but that was as far as
the resemblance went

  for here the houses were laid out in
neat geometrical order all facing into
a central hollow that formed a great
natural amphitheatre the inner dwell-
ings-those closest to the hollow-were
remarkably elaborate for so primitive
a people as were apparently the daug-
avos broad verandas rimmed each of
these houses on them ray could see
the naked beautifully-sculptured forms
of the amazons wandering about chat-
ting or relaxing on rude divans ail

the houses were built on - or -inch
stilts

  behind these first buildings how-
ever it was a different story here
were hovels as crude and flimsy as any
jivaro hut they crowded together
in scattered tumble-down clumps like
the garbage-dump shanties of a depres-
sion hooverville and among them
moved the weary stoop-shouldered
serf-men on whose labor the daugavo
culture was based

  so far no one appeared to have no-
ticed that ray was sitting up unty-
ing his feet the intelligence man tried
standing up still no attention was
paid him

  moving slowly and keeping as low
as possible he slid out of the wall-less
shack and on around the dauvago
towns edge a dozen of the men saw
him but they merely stared at him
stupidly making no effort to question
or halt him

  he was almost half-way around the
strange circular village before he saw
sheila

  the dark-haired girl was standing
by the doorway of one of the houses of
the inner circle there were several
daugavo women on the piazza

  within five minutes ray had worked
his way to the rear of the building
still undiscovered in the lethargy of
this afternoon siesta he rolled quietly
into the narrow space between the
slatted bamboo flooring and the ground
then crawled to a spot directly beneath
sheila picking up a twig he poked
with it at the bottoms of her feet

  the girl glanced down her dark
eyes widened as through the slatting
she caught a glimpse of the lean
bronzed adventurer her hands moved
in a little nervous gesture

  ray motioned toward the dark in-
terior of the house it was empty all
the daugavo women were on the broad
drummers of daugavo



piazza then he crawled hastily back
to a point under the middle of the room

asually sheila yawned she
stepped inside the moment she
was out of view of the amazons she
dropped to her knees

  ray her voice was an excited
whisper

  ssshh he silenced her then
very softly how have they treated
you

  she could not repress a tiny giggle
im an honored guest theyve even
assigned a couple of men to wait on
me

  i wish i could say the same
grunted her companion however
this seems to be one place where the
women run the show

  sheilas face became serious

  what are we going to do ray
whats lubeck got planned for us

  nothing pleasant you can count on
that and as to what were going to
do-well well just have to wait and see
what breaks come he gestured to
the rim of mountains which sur-
rounded the narrow valley in which was
set the daugavo town to the rank
jungle which grew between them and
the crags the way ive got it figured
this place is sort of a lost world-you
know conan doyle stuff the badlands
have shut it off from the world until
its developed its own private culture
with the women holding all power
and-

  he never finished the sentence

  there was a sudden sputter of the
strange daugavo language ray
whirled squatting on her heels and
staring in at him was tigora konrad
lubeck at her side her eyes were
flashing with anger she whipped the
force-ray pistol from her belt pointed
it straight at him she snapped a
curt command

  come out translated lubeck
and as the american crawled into the
open congratulations on your bril-
liant maneuver captain holcomb
you couldnt have done this job better
if id given you specific instructions

  two of the powerful women jerked
ray to his feet another dragged sheila
around beside him

  you see my dear captain these
people have developed strange taboos
lubeck explained they feel that
men and the lower animals are on the
same level therefore they segregate
the male-bar him from ever entering
the sacred precepts of their homes save
upon command

  oh can it we didnt come here
for a lecture on sociology

  the nazi agent grinned wickedly
oh but you must hear it i want you
to understand and appreciate to the full
what is in store for you

rjphe germans gloating tone sent a
ripple of fear down rays spine
he stole a glance at sheila her face
was pale

  the penalty for trespass is a most
interesting one lubeck went on
you recall corrals ocelot no doubt
and the shrunken head feinkell
brought back from his first expedi-
tion

  the american said nothing he
stood defiant brown eyes boring into
the nazis blue-grey ones

 his enemy continued when a
man is insubordinate here he is re-
duced-alive-to barely a foot in
height

  youre lying  ray snarled harshly

  oh on the contrary lubeck was
beaming you recall the drums
dont you the drums that kept beat-
ing in your brain and the way the
world seemed to be pressing in about
you


fantastic adventures

  that my dear captain is dau-
gavo magic it was my other reason
for coming these women long ago
learned how to shrink living creatures
yet the process once completed leaves
the mans brain as alert as ever

  the nazi agents eyes glittered with
triumph now can you understand
why i came he demanded can you
see what a tool for sabotage this process
will be with it i can shrink loyal
nazis to a size where they can get in
anywhere half a dozen such little
men in an airplane factory can plant
time bombs in the wings of hundreds
of fighters they can tamper with
machines they can steal blueprints-
break instruments-destroy irreplace-
able plans yet they themselves will
be so tiny that the chances of your
agents catching them or finding them
or even suspecting their existence are
hopeless

  youve gone mad lubeck ray
grated between clenched teeth in-
sanity is the only thing that could con-
vince you that men would subject them-
selves to such a hideous life not even
a nazi-

  the german agent grinned like a
deaths-head

  youre afraid captain holcomb
he jibed you know there are a mil-
lion men in the third reich who would
jump at the chance so to serve the
fatherland himmler himself ap-
proved this expedition he knew that
the force ray and this sabotage tech-
nique would be worth any effort he
shook his head no im not mad
but youre frightened youre afraid
why should i be do i look it
again the nazi shook his head

  no you do not show it but i
can tell-you are afraid

  you should be too because cap-
tain once again you are to play the
guinea pig

  what do you mean

  malevolence glowed in every line of
the germans broad face

  i mean that tonight my friend
when the drums begin to beat you will
be down there he gestured toward
the amphitheatre you will shrink
to a puny creature a mere foot tall
and then as is the custom with these
people youll be put in a pit with an
ocelot to fight like a roman gladiator
until you die

chapter viii
queens are women

toom boom boom boom

   boom

  down in the amphitheatre the great
drums of the daugavos were beating
they throbbed and echoed like low-
hanging thunder turning the tropic
night into an inferno of strange horror
and stranger passions

  ray holcomb sat in a hut which he
judged to be a sort of prison chamber
his lean brown face was taut with
strain and there were circles beneath
his eyes his mouth felt dry and cot-
tony his tongue too big his head was
aching as it had never ached before
with an awful throbbing tempo that
matched the beating of the monster
tom-toms down below

  for the hundredth time the amer-
ican jumped to his feet he paced the
little rooms floor back and forth
back and forth

  and again one of daugavos amazo-
nian women curtly motioned him to be
still

 through the open doorway the
young captain could see the prepara-
tions down there where the drums
were beating a great stake was being
set into a post-hole tigora and her
naked aides moved about directing the
drummers of daugavo



arrangements off to one side a caged
ocelot maddened by the drums hurled
itself against the bamboo bars of its
prison again and again in a frenzy

  by one slender thread of thought he
clung to sanity one chance he had
one card to play

  its an ace if i can only figure out a
way to use it he said aloud the
daugavo women in the doorway stared
at him curiously

  boom boom boom boom boom

  the tempo was increasing now
the very air was alive with tension

  outside the hut that was rays
prison there was a flurry of sound and
motion

  ray

  it was sheila she flung herself
through the door between the amazo-
nian guards and threw her arms
around the lean young officers neck

  oh my darling ray choked his
own arms were about her and there
in the horror of that strange dungeon
they kissed for the first time

  i finally made them understand i
had to see you before  it happens
the girl whispered they didnt want
to but i kept on begging she buried
her face against the intelligence mans
shoulder oh ray weve got to do
something isnt there anything-
she burst into tears

  the others face was grim may-
be youngster maybe well just
have to wait and see he smoothed
her dark hair breathed in the fragrance
of it as if it were perfume

  then what about you darling
what have they done to you

  i-im all right tigora was furi-
ous at first but lubeck persuaded
her to forgive me

  lubeck did

  sheila nodded tremulously yes

  that devil rays breath came
hard has he got his eye on you

damn him

  the girl buried her face against his
shoulder once more

  no

  but the very brevity of her reply
sent needles of suspicion stabbing into
rays heart

  youre holding something back
he slashed what is it tell me

tts-its feinkell h-h-he  wants
   me

  feinkell

  rays voice was alive with shock and
rage in his minds eye he saw the
white-haired scientist with his thin
slavering lips and the fanatics gleam in
his eyes the very thought of the
mans cadaverous face and gaunt form
near any woman-let alone sheila-
sent a wave of nausea surging through
the american

  but before he could so much as
speak a sharp command came from
outside the hut the daugavos at the
door turned upon him their powerful
hands tore sheila from his arms de-
spite his struggles they dragged him
outside and down the slope into the
amphitheatre

  nero would have been at home here

  crowding the natural basins sides
were the women of daugavo their
voices blended with the thunder of the
drums in a savage symphony

  in the forefront close to the stake
towered a dais ten feet high here sat
tigora magnificently primitive on a
great hewn throne her bare brown
skin glowed golden in the light of the
flickering torches that blazed about her
proud eyes swept the throng

  savage she was and queen she was
too regal in every line and motion

  beside her cold and haughty as any
prussian war lord and likewise en-
throned sat konrad lubeck nazi-
doms ace agent his eyes also swept


fantastic adventures

over the gathering but they were
frigid and contemptuous

 then while ray watched the
daugavos queen turned to speak to
the german the imperious lines of
her face softened as she gazed at the
master spy ray saw her touch lu-
becks arm in a caress the nazi in
turn gripped her fingers in his own
he smiled at tigora and leaned close
to whisper something in her ear

  below tigora and lubeck on a sort
of step half-way to the ground were
gaunt professor feinkell and chubby
little krag feinkell was leaning for-
ward like an inquisitive crane making
voluminous notes on all that transpired
his companion however was pale he
lay back in his seat weakly

  the two daugavos dragged ray be-
fore the dais the american caught a
glimpse of a third hurrying toward the
stake behind him with a rope

  abruptly tigora arose from her
throne she glared down at the lean
young officer she shouted angry
phrases at him

  at last she stopped lubeck leaned
forward

  she has charged you with desecrat-
ing a womans home he reported with
an evil grin and she has ordered that
you pay the penalty he half-bowed
and so captain holcomb farewell

  in the moment that followed-long
as eternity-ray felt his guards tug at
his arms but he paid them no heed
nor did he turn to answer sheilas
frantic cry somewhere behind him not
even konrad lubecks mocking smile
disturbed him even though their eyes
were locked in a glare of mutual hate

  instead he breathed a silent prayer
a prayer to the great gods of daring and
of courage and of luck those three
mighty deities who have brought so
many adventurers forth from the valley
of death

  and then as a leopard leaps he
sprang

iltis wrists jerked free from the
guards grasp before they could so
much as realize what was happening
he lunged for the dais

  all about him the amphitheatre
rocked in bedlam but ray paid it no
heed he was leaping for the half-way
step on which sat krag and feinkell
faces twisted in sudden fear they
scrambled for safety he saw tigora
come to her feet saw lubeck whip out
the military mauser

  the american did not even try to go
higher his hand shot out caught
krag by the nape of the neck

  then while the crowd stood para-
lyzed in stark amazement and even the
drums went dead the bronzed intel-
ligence man ripped at fat krags
clothes he tore them off like husks
the others voice rose in a scream of
terror

  but more than clothes came away
padding burst out in a kapok cataract
the fat jowls ripped off thin patches
of treated gauze a dozen strange ac-
couterments fell to the platform

  and there revealed stood freda lu-
beck konrad lubecks shapely lovely
wife

  cringing and blushing in her nudity
she tried to cover herself ray shoved
her in front of tigora

  look at her he roared shes
his wife

  his words meant nothing to the
daugavo queen but sign language is
universal her eyes flashed from the
man beside her to the woman below

  not even konrad lubeck master of
his emotions though he was could wipe
the guilt from his face fast enough

  a tidal wave of hate rose in tigoras
eyes her scream was as fierce as a
wounded jaguars she struck at the
drummers of daugavo



man who but a moment before had
shared her throne he toppled back-
ward off the dais

  again the queen screamed and again
but no longer were her cries mere in-
coherent sounds like a general she
shouted orders her subjects rushed
to obey

  they swept over the dais like army
ants pinioning ray feinkell and
freda lubeck alike

  lubeck himself staggered to his feet
the mauser was still in his grasp he
started to lift it

  as if shot from a bow one of the
amazons dived off the dais toward him
he fell back the gun knocked from his
hand before he could fire a shot

  boom - boom - boom - boom - boom -
boom-boom

  the drums sprang from silence to a
thunderous roll as if by magic the
amphitheatres tumult died

  tigora stood close beside her throne
her arms flung high above her head
again the drums stopped

  aiaguanal

  boom boom boomi boom boom

  once more the tom-toms took up that
awful throbbing tempo that had
haunted the travelers all through the
badlands

pjelpless in the grasp of the giant
daugavo women the whites-
ray sheila feinkell and freda and
konrad lubeck-were dragged before
the dais tigora stared down at them
she had regained her poise and native
dignity but hell shone in her black eyes

  lubecks voice rose in a half-hys-
terical stream of curses you he
raged at ray youve killed us all
damn you but why did you think
you could save your own skin-

  the worst of the strain had gone
from the others face

  no lubeck he shook his head

the faintest of smiles playing about his
mouth no my own skin didnt enter
into the thing

  i came here to stop you well ive
done it force rays and pygmy sabo-
teurs are two problems the united
states wont have to cope with in this
war

  for a long second the master spy
stared at the lean young officer slowly
reluctant admiration spread over his
face he smiled thinly

  correct captain holcomb he
clipped and his voice was once again
steady and even you have won your
achievement gives me a respect for your
country that i never knew before at
least however you have destroyed
yourself too we die together

  tigoras voice interrupted them she
gestured imperiously the daugavos
holding ray and sheila dragged them
back to a position close beside the dais

  lubecks jaw went tense at the
queens words

  no he shouted writhing in his
captors grasp no you cant kill
us and let them go

  but tigoras face was stony she
snapped another order the women
holding lubeck his wife and feinkell
shoved the trio toward the stake in the
center of the hollow

  but feinkells eyes were blazing with
a mad light he hurled himself back
tore free from the daugavos stum-
bling and panting he ran toward the
farthest edge of the amphitheatre

  tigora screamed an order a dozen
of the amazons raced after the white-
haired scientist

  the professor stopped in mid-stride
whirling he hurled himself on his pur-
suers heedless of the knives and spears
and force-ray pistols they carried
there was a flurry of action and then
huddenly feinkell was down

  the daugavos carried his limp form


fantastic adventures

back to the dais a dozen weapons had
spitted him blood fast was dyeing his
clothing crimson already he was dead

  sheila clung to ray oh its hor-
rible its horrible she whispered

  he took the quick way out he an-
swered quietly holding her tight he
knew he couldnt get away so he
wanted to die quickly hes satisfied
now

phe dead mans body was dumped
to the ground like so much carrion
the amazons began binding lubeck
and his wife to the stake

  stiff with tension brown eyes smoul-
dering ray watched them lubeck
stood stiff and unyielding his face
coldly contemptuous

  but freda his wife was crying as
the daugavos tightened the thongs

  lubeck ray shouted

  the nazis eyes met his well
captain do you wish to taunt me as
i die

  forget it lubeck you rate dying
but your wifes a woman ask tigora
to let her go

  do you think tigora would heed
me now the spys lip curled

  the american shook his head no
but if you tell her im asking her and
i confirm it by sign language-

  for the first time ray could remem-
ber the ice went out of lubecks blue-
grey eyes thank you captain he
turned to the queen addressed her in
the daugavo dialect

  for five minutes they talked slowly
the nazis arguments prevailed the
queen turned to ray a question in her
black eyes

  ray nodded gestured toward freda

  tigora hesitated then slowly she
too nodded she snapped a command
one of a daugavos slashed freda lu-
becks bonds and dragged her-moan-
ing and on the point of collapse-to

ray and sheila

  boom boom boom boom boom

  the throb of the drums grew louder
majestically tigora descended from
her throne she moved toward lu-
beck lashed to the stake in the center
of the hollow

  the daugavos were chanting now
in time with the beat of the tom-toms
their magnificent bodies were jerking
like those of puppets as the rhythm
seized them

  tigora stood before the nazi agent
her own voice rose above the others
like the cry of a jungle beast she
gestured and another of the women
swayed forward with a great bowl

  still chanting the daugavos queen
held the vessel to lubecks lips he
tried to dash it away but one of the
amazons seized his head in a grip of
iron tigora tilted the bowl forward
he was forced to drink

  the tom-toms beat faster here and
there a woman lost control of her body
leaped into the hollow in a frenzied
dance

  sheila clung to ray

  my head she cried its shrink-
ing the worlds falling in on me

  he gripped her shoulders hang
onto yourself he commanded fiercely
nothings happening to you nothing
will all youre feeling is the will-
power of these people theyre project-
ing it like a living force but it cant
hurt usl it cant i

tjte was talking to himself as much
as to her trying to hold the mad-
ness of the drums and the chant and
the wild dance and the very scene itself
from his brain

  and out in the center of the hollow
konrad lubeck stood braced against
the stake his face was distorted with
strain and a grimace of pain had bared
his teeth sweat streamed down his
drummers of daugavo



cheeks his eyes had rolled up until
only the whites were visible

  boom - boom - boom - boom - boom -
boom

  louder and louder faster and faster
thundered the tom-toms the chant-
ing rose and fell like the wailing of a
wild wind more and more of the
daugavo women surrendered to the
savage passion of the rites like mad
they danced faster    faster   
faster   

  rays lips were moving his face taut
he held sheila tight against him her
face buried against his shoulder

 my god my god he choked
they cant do it    they cant-i

  but before his very eyes they were
doing it lubeck was screaming in
agony and slowly    slowly   
his body was shrinking

  seconds as long as a lifetime grew
to minutes that were eternity and then
to hours on and on about the stake
the daugavo women danced while ti-
gora like evil incarnate swayed as an
anaconda sways and forced more and
more of the liquid in the owl she held
between konrad lubecks tortured lips

  and on through the seconds and min-
utes and hours lubeck grew smaller
and smaller until at last he stood but
 inches high a tiny figure against the
daugavo queen

  as suddenly as they had started
then the drums stopped the chant
died in the womens throats exhausted
by the orgy they collapsed where they
stood great lumps of weary flesh in a
pagan saturnalia of horror

  for an hour perhaps they rested
then slowly again they arose the
caged ocelot was dragged forward re-
leased in a narrow pit

  now tigora again came forward
she lifted lubeck in her arms as a
mother might a child but black hate
still gleamed in her eyes

  she carried him to the edge of the pit
lubeck looked down saw the ocelot

  he turned then to where ray stood
guarded and helpless his lips twisted
in the contemptuous cold smile so char-
acteristic of him his hand snapped up
in a mocking salute

  tigora dangled a rope into the pit
picking up the nazi she held him so
he could grip it the amazons leaned
forward savage expectancy in every
line

  clutching the rope lubeck hung for
a moment he sneered into the circle
of daugavo faces then in a final
supreme gesture of contempt he spat
full into tigoras eyes

  he died with the first snap of the
ocelots jaws

          chapter ix
          life sentence

preda lubeck said still i do
not understand how you did this
thing how could you know i and
krag were one

  ray his arm around sheila managed
a weak grin thirty hours had passed
since lubecks death but all three were
yet haggard from the strain of that ter-
rible night

  your husband tipped me off he re-
plied you see i kept feeling all
along that something was wrong when
you didnt show up every operative
knows that lubeck wouldnt work with-
out you

 but how-

  i caught the angle though when i
asked lubeck how youd feel about his
making love to tigora

  now if youd been a couple of thou-
sand miles away hed probably have
said something about what she doesnt
know wont hurt her or the like

  but he didnt he acted as if it was


fantastic adventures

a real immediate problem-talked
about how youd have to make the sac-
rifice and that kind of thing

  i knew then that you must be along
which meant that you must be dis-
guised i knew you couldnt be fein-
kell of course no woman as young and
as attractive as you could be made up
to look like that bag of bones

  krag was a different story he was
about your height and i could see right
off the bat that some padding and a
good job of barbering along with a
few other changes could fix you up
so youd pass as a man

  whered you get the idea of tearing
fredas clothes off though sheila de-
manded wriggling into a more com-
fortable position in the crook of the
bronzed intelligence mans arm

  again ray grinned

  lubeck was working on the theory
that tigora was a woman as well as a
queen he figured he could get what
he wanted by making her fall in love
with him

  i realized he was right-she was a
woman so i decided shed get jealous
and angry if she found he was two-
timing her especially if it was ob-
vious to all the rest of the tribe too
so that shed lose face he shrugged
well there it is i couldnt talk her
language so the only way i could ex-
pose the deal was to prove that lubeck
had a woman of his own race with his
party by luck you-he nodded to
freda-were on that dais so i went
about things in the most direct way

  the wife of lubeck stared at him
her eyes were smouldering so you
exposed me-and killed konrad she
said in a tense voice

  ray met her gaze

  for your sake im sorry he said
quietly beyond that-no our coun-
tries are at war and both he and i were
playing a dangerous game he did his

best a dozen times to kill sheila and
me he couldnt expect different re-
sults when he lost

jphere was a long oppressive mo-
ment of silence freda lubeck
stared at the ground

  at last she got to her feet

  let us now go tigora to see she
suggested in a listless voice this place
-i cannot stand it i want to leave
let us ask her when we can go
together the trio arose they found
the daugavos queen sitting on the
bank of the river up which they had
come freda who had learned a few
words of the daugavo tongue explained
what they wanted

  tigora leaped erect eyes flashing
she shook her head violently spat out
a dozen angry words

  what is it freda sheila de-
manded anxiously what does she
say

  lubecks wife turned she wont
let us go  she cried she says never
can we leave

  what do you mean snapped ray
that cant be right-

  but it is she says she will let us
live here forever in peace but that
never may we go away she says that
when one white man came to the land
of the daugavos and left he with four
others returned if she lets us go many
others will come back and soon her
land will be overrun with whites

  ray stared at the queen in open-
mouthed stupefaction sheila beside
him

  but from the freda lubeck came a
tight choked sob i cannot stand it
she whispered in her low accent-laden
voice every night the drums they
will drive me mad i hear them and
i think of konrad-of the ocelot-oh
she dropped to the ground still sob-
bing
drummers of daugavo



  tigora shot the weeping woman a
contemptuous glance and walked away
the drums the drums

  ray looked helplessly at sheila
what can i do he said sadly noth-
ing i can say to her will help

  the girl nodded i know she
must have loved him very much a
pause and the drums-theyre ter-
rible even now that ive seen them
i cant stand them

  the bronzed intelligence man nod-
ded his lean face sober theyre
more than drums he said theyre
what you might call a psychic force
somehow they translate all the pent-
up passion of these people into a wave
of malevolence that reaches far beyond
the actual sound of the drums i heard
them beating in chicago when i first
saw the movies feinkell took when he
was here before it was the same way
when i saw that shrunken daugavo
head and when we first entered the
badlands the force the rites of these
people generates-

  yes sheila interrupted but what
are we going to do we cant stay
here   

  ray nodded his agreement with this
well get away he said stealing a
canoe should be easy and-

rpreda lubeck sat up

it wont do you any good she

said

  what do you mean

  the spys widow smiled without hu-
mor you were brought here uncon-
scious she said so you dont know
what lies between us and freedom
well

  there is a whirlpool in the canyon
below us nothing could come through
it alive beside it runs a narrow ledge
of rock to enter the land of the dau-
gavos you must come along it and
it is guarded so none may pass

  ray forced a grin dont let it worry
you he suggested theres always
a way out and some of these days well
find it

  but as the days rolled by the lean
young officer began to wonder on all
sides this strange valley was hemmed
in by rocky impenetrable badlands
desolate and uncharted only at the
one point was the wilderness travers-
able-by skirting the whirlpool on the
narrow ledge freda had described then
floating down the river

  he was pondering the problem for
the multi-thousandth time one after-
noon when sheila came to him she
sat down on the soft grass of the river
bank close to his side

  any luck ray have you found a
way out for us yet

  he grinned down at her wearily
wrinkles of worry furrowed his tanned
forehead sorry youngster i dont
seem to be getting very far

  i wonder if well ever get back
she smiled a little not that it isnt
nice here in some ways its almost
a shangri-la but i cant get used
to    the nights   

  i know he nodded the drums
im afraid wed never get used to them
besides i cant forget the outside
theres a war on and my buddies are
in it   

  a sudden shadow darkened sheilas
lovely face yes the war she
hesitated then darling have you
noticed freda lately

 noticed her her companions
face was puzzled i dont get it what
do you mean

  shes gotten to be great friends with
tigora lately shes taking part in the
rites at night and this morning i no-
ticed she had a force-ray pistol in her
bed

  ray frowned you dont think shed
try the same thing lubeck did do you


fantastic adventures

like learning the secret of the force
ray and the shrinking process and so
on

  i dont know of course sheila
was very serious but somehow ray
i cant trust that woman first and
last shes a nazi and ive got a feel-
ing she hates you for lubecks death

  the young officer shrugged if she
does im sorry but i dont see what
i can do about it he rose come
on lets go back into the village if
i sit here thinking any longer ill go
crazy

  they were walking close to the edge
of the amphitheatre when the lightning
struck

  one moment there was the drowsy
silence of a summer afternoon broken
only by the faint raucous calls of
toucans macaws and parrots from the
nearby jungle

  the next tigoras angry voice rang
out sharp and clear

  what- ray sprang to the alert

  chat-chat-chat-chat

  lubecks mauser

tefore the two americans could
so much as move freda burst from
behind tigoras house running full-tilt
the military automatic that had been
her husbands was gripped in her right-
hand she raced toward them

  freda what have you done

 run you fools the woman
screamed ive killed tigora theyre
after us

  even as her words reached them
daugavo women rushed into view

  ray took in the situation in one tense
glance

  the river he shouted come
onl if we can out-run em weve got a
chance

  hell-bent the three of them sprinted
for the waters edge ray in the lead
he darted into a thicket of bamboo

the next instant he was dragging out a
canoe

  get in

  the two women needed no urging
seconds later they had the craft in mid-
stream they paddled down-river

  what happened ray grated
what did you kill her for

  freda lubeck laughed half-hysteri-
cally all right the truth will i tell
you she cried i killed her most of
all because she killed konrad i swore
the night he died i would kill her and
you too who sent him to his death
again she laughed you are dead now
together the three of us in the whirl-
pool shall perish

  sheila in the bow turned her dark
eyes were sharp

  theres more to it than that
freda she snapped i know you
youd never have planned to kill any-
one in such a way that your own
precious skin was endangered whats
the rest of it

  silence

  she caught you didnt she
stabbed sheila tigora caught you
stealing the secret of how the force
ray is made and how the daugavos
shrink a man alive

  what if she did fredas control
was going fast her voice was a wild
shriek she tried to clamber upright
in the dugout shes dead isnt she
i have her killed

  sit down ray roared youll tip
us over you fool

 but sheila did more than
shout turning she brought the butt
of her paddle hard down on the head
of freda lubeck it was a vicious blow
with her full strength behind it the
german woman collapsed in the bot-
tom of the canoe ray sighed his re-
lief

  this canoe looks as if youd been
getting ready for a getaway ray
drummers of daugavo



sheila said as she resumed her paddling

 the intelligence man nodded
thats right ive got everything on
board i could think of-food a ma-
chete ropes some bark cloth he
forced a grin you see i had to have
something to do when i couldnt figure
a way out so i fixed this up thought
maybe we could try to ride the whirl-
pool if worst came to worst

jut tragedy was too imminent for
either of them to be in a mood for
conversation already they could see
other daugavo canoes putting out from
shore after them

  on downstream they drove out of
the valley and into a narrow canyon
with high steep sides here the river
ran so fast that its surface was flecked
with foam along the one side they
could see the narrow ledge of rock
which formed a footpath from the lower
river into the daugavo country ahead
the stream swung sharply to the right
paddling close to the outside of the
curve they rounded the turn

  ray the whirlpool

  sheilas voice was alive with panic
she half-rose staring ahead in strange
fascination to the churning maelstrom
that barred their way

  a tiny bamboo-sprinkled beach had
accumulated in the far corner of the
bend a quiet eddy protected by great
rocks ray dug deep with his paddle
drove straight for it an instant later
they had landed

  he helped sheila-trembling with
excitement-from the dugout freda
lubeck still lay unconscious on its
bottom then anxiously he looked
back upstream for signs of the dauga-
vos

  must be they dont dare chance it
so near the whirlpool he muttered
when they did not appear

sheila looked up at him have

we got a chance ray

  i dont know sheila but not if we
have to try paddling through that whirl-
pool

  carefully he made a systematic sur-
vey of their position at this point the
river made what is sometimes called
a stairstep turn-that is it came rush-
ing down from the daugavo country
above swung sharply right then swung
left again between these two bends-
which were only a few yards apart--
lay the whirlpool the beach on which
they had landed was in the outer corner
of the first bend across the river was
the rock ledge of the daugavo trail
terminating in a little strip of beach
similar to their own but located beyond
the whirlpool in the corner formed by
the second bend and beyond the
second bend lay smooth water

  if we could cross the river to that
ledge ray said slowly eyes narrowed
we might have a chance

  as if to contradict him a half-dozen
daugavo women scurried down the nar-
row footpath one drew her force-ray
pistol as she came abreast the whites

  ray dived for the canoe snatch-
ing lubecks mauser from where freda
had dropped it he snapped a shot close
to the amazons head the woman and
her companions beat a hasty retreat
taking refuge in a rock crevice a few
feet upstream

  that does for us ray clipped
they cant hurt us from where they
are but if we try to cross to the ledge
theyll pick us off

  then suddenly the sun dropped be-
hind the canyon walls the tropic night
began to descend and rising in in-
verse ratio came the throbbing boom-
boom-boom of daugavos drums

jphey spent a night of misery there
in the pitch-blackness of the can-
yons depths it would have been bad


fantastic adventures

enough even for sheila and ray alone
for the drums thundered incessantly
and rain fell and their fear of attack
by the amazons made them forego a
fire and then on top of it all freda
lubeck recovered consciousness just
enough to rant and rave and scream in
wild hysteria

  by mornings light things looked lit-
tle better the canyons walls- an
earlier hope-were sheer and unscal-
able they caught glimpses too of
the daugavos on the ledge across the
river menacing as before cutting off
any possible hope of retreat upstream

  ray shook his head slowly im
afraid this is it he said grimly if
we stay here we starve if we go on
we die in the whirlpool

  sheila stared off down the river to
the smooth water beyond the mael-
strom and the little bamboo-studded
beach at the end of the daugavo ledge

  if only we were birds she sighed
we could fly across there straight as
an arrow-

  an arrow  ray sprang to his feet
my god girl youve got it an
arrow  there was sudden hope in his
tone

  an arrow-

  of course dont you see all
these clumps of bamboo-well make a
bow and arrow a big one

  ray are you crazy-

  but the lean young american was
already at work he snatched the
machete from the bottom of the boat
slashing into the clumps of bamboo
with savage strokes

  all morning he worked by noon he
had built a monster bow a full  feet
long he lashed it to bamboo piling
driven deep into the sand

  a five-foot arrow half as thick as a
mans wrist followed around its mid-
dle he tied the long rope he had brought
with him from the daugavo village

  if were lucky he explained ex-
citedly his brown eyes shining ill
be able to shoot this arrow straight
across the whirlpool and into that
thickest clump of bamboo on the other
beach at the lower end of the daugavo
trail

  freda lubeck gave a small de-
spondent laugh even if do it you
could what good wtould it do she
asked

  yes broke in sheila how will
it help

ray s brown eyes had never been
    more intense

  maybe not at all he said grimly
but its a chance its better than sit-
ting here waiting to die

  if the arrow goes into that clump
of bamboo especially with the rope
tied around the center the way it is
itll jam crosswise itll never pull out
from there

  then with you two heaving on the
rope for all youre worth and me pad-
dling well have a chance to work our
way around the edge of that whirl-
pool not much of a chance but a
devil of a lot better one than weve
got now

  sheila gripped his arm

  oh if we could only do it she
cried it is worth trying it is

  freda apparently had been paying
them no heed she had been staring
upstream eyes dull and morose but
now she turned

  if something you are going to try
she said you had better do it now
they are coming for us

  her companions whirled knowing
what to expect

  there drifting slowly down the river
toward them at the end of a long line
came a great war canoe and crowd-
ing it-their faces hate-distorted-were
daugavo women
drummers of daugavo



          chapter x
          journeys end

jace tense ray sprang to the giant
bow working like mad he racked
it back with bamboo levers carefully
he sighted along the arrow

  hurry came sheilas low ner-
vous voice theyre coming closer
the bronzed american changed the
arrows position a trifle hastily he
checked the coiling of the rope made
sure it was lashed securely to the bow
of their canoe he gripped the stave
that acted as a trigger-

  tnnngggg

  the bowstring twanged its wild song
the trio on the beach stood breath-
less watching the arrows flight
straight and true it hurtled through
the air on-on-on and then it
fell not in the bamboo clump but on
the sandy beach they hoped to reach

  i didnt figure enough on the weight
of the rope pulling it down ray
grated he gripped the rope pulled the
arrow into the water and back toward
them through the very heart of the
whirlpool

  rayl theyre coming

  it was sheilas voice shrill with ex-
citement the lean officer spun about
he saw the daugavo war canoe as it
swung in toward their little strip of
beach

  rays hand flashed down to his belt
came up with lubecks mauser he
snapped it to full automatic
chat-chat-chat-chat

  the gun stuttered its hail of death
across the water an amazon gave a
shrill cry and pitched into the water
others crumpled in the boat the re-
mainder hastily pulled the craft back
upstream

  again the intelligence man reeled in
the rope another instant and the ar-

row came in

  coil the cord he flung over his
shoulder to sheila he sprang back to
the catapult hurled himself to the task
of bending the bow again

  a glance upstream told him that the
daugavos were coming back under
his breath he cursed that last burst
had emptied lubecks mauser this
time its high-powered bullets would not
drive back the amazons

  sweat running into his eyes he
braced the bow again he sighted
along the arrow this time changing the
elevation to try to make up for the
weight of the water-soaked rope

  theyre coming cried sheila

  her panting companion did not so
much as look up his brown eyes were
riveted on that little patch of green
across the water so near and yet so far
he tried to stop the trembling of his
hand then with a gasp that was at
once an imprecation and a prayer he
let the bowstring go

  tnnngggg

  it seemed like a higher note this time
the great arrow sang across the water
its blunt nose drove deep into-and
beyond-the bamboo target

  ray help

jlte whirled the amazons ca-
noe already was grounding its
giant women were springing forward
like wolves toward a wounded stag

  full into the face of the foremost
ray hurled the empty mauser

  the canoe he roared run for
it

  were ready sheila cried

  turning ray sprinted across the few
yards separating him from the craft
the amazons close on his heels he
gripped the stern    heaved with all
his might

  the canoe shot out into the current
he stumbled after it half-fell half-


fantastic adventures

clambered aboard

  the next instant they were rushing
headlong toward the whirlpools foam-
flecked core

  heave on that line for gods sake
heave

  even as he shouted ray snatched
up the paddle he drove it deep turned
the canoe away from the maelstroms
vortex

  the five minutes that followed re-
mained forever a nightmare the
swirling waters clutched at them like
deaths own icy fingers but they fought
their way onward on across those
few awful yards of churning green and
white on until at last their frail craft
touched bottom on the other side and
they staggered ashore to fall exhausted
on the sandy beach

  brief minutes later ray lurched
wearily to his feet

  come on he commanded helping
sheila erect the more miles we can
put between us and this devils domain
the better ill like it

  yes the girl shivered to never
hear those drums again would be too
soon

  they turned toward freda she was
gone

 what-

  auf wiedersehen you fools

  as one they spun about

  konrad lubecks widow stood in the
stern of their canoe it was already
yards from shore she waved mock-
ingly to them

  auf wiedersehen she repeated i
go now to deliver to the third reich
the secrets my husband came for-the
force ray the reduction technique
even in death he shall triumph 

  incredulity-stark disbelie f-s t o o d
out in rays eyes

  you cant- he choked not even
a nazi could desert the people who
saved her life twice over-

  the womans laugh drifted back to
him across the water mercy is a
weakness  she retorted that is why
you and your country are losing you
should never have saved an enemys
life in the first place

  his eyes burning like hot coals the
young american watched her as she
started to turn in the boat and then
quite suddenly while his eyes were still
upon her the canoe jerked up short

  the rope  cried sheila close to his
side she forgot to cut the rope

rjphe sudden stop threw the german
woman off balance she tottered
for an instant arms flailing wildly as
she tried to regain her balance

  but the canoe rocked in the current
she toppled plunged overboard her
body struck the water with a loud
splash she threshed about

  aiieee

  it was the scream of a soul in pur-
gatory of death and the devils laugh-
ter

  ray sheila cried she clutched
his arm what is it- that scream
-

  the lean officers arm tightened
about her

pirana fish are small but they run
in schools he said quietly they can
eat a man alive in less than a minute
a shudder ran through the girls
slender form he held her to him

  that ends it he said konrad
lubeck and his wife are dead and the
secret of the force ray and the shrink-
ing process died with them

  sheila looked up her face still was
drawn from the horror of it all but
somehow she forced a little smile to play
around the corners of her mouth

  does that end it she asked softly
the force ray and all i mean

  ray frowned what do you mean
  from beneath her ragged blouse the
drummers of daugavo



girl drew a wallet

  i couldnt bring myself to trust
freda she explained not ever i
was afraid shed do something like this

  so yesterday while she was uncon-
scious i stole this wallet from under-
neath her dress and put an old one i
had in to replace it

	 

ur scientists feel confident that
something very interesting--and
disastrous-to the axis will come from
the force ray captain holcomb an-
nounced colonel joseph randolph as
for the reduction process that will be
turned over to medical research centers
for further investigation

  yes sir ray managed to sneak
in a sidelong glance at sheila standing
off at the far side of the room and look-
ing very proud and happy

  as the result of your having made
these contributions to victory plus
eliminating konrad lubeck it has been
decided to drop various charges previ-
ously placed against you the colonel
went on

  thank you sir

  the colonel tried to look stern with-
out too much success

  at any rate captain holcomb he
continued there is an old army saying
that when a man disobeys orders he is
either court-martialed or given a medal
this time you get the medal-specif-
ically the distinguished service medal
it is your reward for exceptionally
meritorious service to the government
in a task of great responsibility

  at that and because this was a pri-
vate conference instead of the im-
pressive public ceremony at which the
actual decoration would be awarded
captain raymond holcomb allowed his
special sunday grin to brighten up his
lean bronzed face

  thank you sir he said i shall
be deeply appreciative of the medal
but as far as rewards are concerned-
and again he unleashed the grin-i
think i got more than my share when
sheila married me

  for once captain holcomb colo-
nel randolph observed gravely we
agree perfectly

the end

the old juke box broke down-

probably no greater calamity could be-
fall the jitterbugs and hep-cats of america
than the break down of all the juke boxes
and the destruction of all our records and yet
all these records could never have been made in
the first place if it hadnt been for a small ori-
ental insect which produces the shellac to sur-
face the records

  this insect is known as laccifer lacca but is
called lac for short they reproduce with unbe-
lievable speed on the bangan as well as other
oriental trees and thus produce the substance
from which shellac is finally obtained they are
placed on a tree which is called a lac host and
the insect inserts its beak and starts to drink the
sap it exudes a resin which accumulates until
it is plentiful enough to become its home and
breeding place

  after a branch is covered with resin from the
thousands of insects it is removed by a collector
who scrapes the lac into satfsage-shaped cloth
bags then the bags are hung in front of char-
coal fires and the heat causes the lac to strain

through the cloth the melted resin is then
allowed to cool and form flakes known to the
natives as shell-lac from which we get our name
shellac

  the bengal province of india together with
a few nearby provinces accounts for about 
of the worlds shellac the rest is produced in
the other oriental countries of china thailand
and burma none of it is produced in this
country and since the war our only source is
india we import over half of indias output
and use it to surface phonograph records radio
recordings and to give shells and military in-
struments a coat that will not rust it also finds
uses in the manufacture of polishes paints ad-
hesives etc

  this imported shellac is very important to us
since the synthetic products produced thus far
have been unable to satisfy all the uses for
which shellac fills the bill this is only one of
the many reasons why our communication with
india must be kept open

      strange things come to pass when man
      meddles with the science of demonotogy

i was sitting at the bar of the
drakes club enjoying a reflective
scotch and soda when i happened
to glance up and see marmaduke van
milton standing in the doorway

  i lowered my eyes and hoped fervent-
ly that he would go away without see-
ing me there is nothing essentially
wrong with marmaduke but he has
a quality of vacant cheerfulness about
him that i find very depressing also
if he has a brain it is not of the normal
type marmaduke is one of those ami-
able pointless disjointed souls that
wander through life without rhyme or
reason equipped with an elfin inno-
cence that strangely enough is fre-
quently more effective than the most
cynical shrewdness

    i risked another glance in the mir-
  ror and saw that he was still standing
  in the doorway with a vague look on
  his face as if he were wondering how
  he had gotten there marmaduke is tall
  and pale with mild blue eyes and yel-
  low hair the habitually vacant ex-
  pression on his face would be difficult
  to classify so i wont try

    suddenly his eyes met mine in the
  mirror he waved a limp hand at me
  and started slowly across the floor a
  bright smile on his face

     simply wonderful to see you again
  he said climbing onto a stool beside
  me where have you been hiding
  i had had dinner with him the eve-
  ning before but apparently he had for-
  gotten

    ive been around have a drink
  i asked without enthusiasm

    glad to glad to marmaduke said
  heartily

the bartender set him up a scotch
and soda which marmaduke drank in
 one long breath he ordered another
fine to see you again he said be-
tween drinks

     then take a good look i said im
  going into the air corps in two weeks
  are you now marmaduke cried
  apparently delighted at the news




fantastic adventures

how wonderful

  he lifted his drink to his lips and
then set it down there was a troubled
look on his face he regarded me
soberly

  but old fellow he said you cant
fly one of those things can you

  no but theyll teach me

  oh he said his frown cleared
and a smile broke through they teach
you do they

  yes i said patiently they fig-
ured itd be more interesting for the
boys if they knew how to fly when they
took the planes up

  shrewd of them marmaduke said
nodding his head thoughtfully i
mean if a fellows going to go dashing
around the clouds in a plane hed be in
a bad way not knowing how to fly
marmaduke pronounced this deliber-
ate judgment as if it were the last con-
clusion of the einstein theory

  i began to experience the desperate
trapped feeling that too much of mar-
madukes company inevitably brought
about

  lots of the old crowd going into the
service marmaduke said as if that
were some deep mystery he glanced
moodily about the deserted bar wont
be any of the chaps left at this rate
he swallowed another sip of scotch and
shook his head have a devil of time
finding a badminton partner these days
cant tell where its all going to end
i looked sidewise at him

   well thats war i said

t didnt ask him how he stood in
the draft for i was certain that
would unloose a deluge of vacant ram-
bling remarks which would leave me
completely bewildered i wasnt inter-
ested anyway when and if the army
gets marmaduke i dont want to know
about it it wont help my morale any
as you say thats war marmaduke

echoed hollowly youd think from his
doleful voice that the british fleet had
just been destroyed and sunk

  pretty grim isnt it i said
dashed grim marmaduke said
sipping his drink thoughtfully

  well i said philosophically there
wont be much doing around here any-
way with the crowd gone were about
the last left as it is danny malloy
left and so have buckets and stoop and
billy pointdexter-

  pointdexter hasnt gone marma-
duke said unexpectedly

  no i havent seen him around for
a couple of months where is he
dashed if i know marmaduke
said he was rejected by the army
took it pretty hard too but i dont
know where the blighter is now

  this is news to me i said
marmaduke ordered another drink
saw him about a month ago he
frowned and looked down at the bar
mightve been longer than that
though never did have much of a
head for dates he was in a bad way
i tried to help him out but i wasnt
much good i guess anyway i smashed
all of his deuced apparatus that was
the only way i could think to get him
out into the fresh air

  what are you babbling about i
demanded

  marmaduke looked surprised
didnt i tell you about pointdexter
really the whole thing is quite mysteri-
ous i thought i told you but maybe
it was my uncle freddie

  organize that thing you call a mind
and start making sense will you i
said irritably you havent said a
word to me about pointdexter

  well marmaduke said i shall
tell you the whole story immediately
its really frightfully interesting
well get on with it i said
righto he finished his drink and
the man who cried werewolf



set the glass down on the bar do you
know anything about werewolves he
asked

  i started slightly this sudden and
silly digression was typical of marma-
duke but his casual tone was disturbing

  no i dont i snapped

 well never mind marmaduke
said smiling but it is an interesting
subject

  get on with pointdexter i said

  righto he said he waved to the
bartender for another round of drinks
and twisted around to face me his long
horsy features beaming vacantly

jt all started marmaduke said
cheerfully about two or three
months ago when i bumped into billy
pointdexter when he was leaving the
club rather latish one evening

  he looked decidedly glum there
was a bitter scowl on his dark face and
a very unsociable gleam m his eyes if
ever a man appeared to need a bit of
the old cheering up it was pointdexter
that night

  as a true-blue friend and fellow club
member i felt that the job was one i
couldnt shirk

  what ho i said by way of greet-
ing

  he looked at me with disgust

  please go away he said

  i laughed heartily pointdexters
sense of humor always rolls me in the
aisle

  why the gloomy phiz i asked
you look as if youve lost your last
lump of sugar

  you wouldnt understand he mut-
tered gloomily

  we were standing in front of the club
and it was raining nastily he was
waiting for a cab i was just waiting

  thats not the right spirit i said
i could see he was in a bad way he
was staring darkly at the wet pavement

  and he seemed oblivious to the crowds
hurrying past occasionally he would
glance up and look wearily at the traf-
fic for a cab

  please go away marmaduke he
said i am not in the mood for
company

  now look here old fellow i said
taking his arm if you think im go-
ing to walk out on you youve got
another guess coming im not going to
desert you so cheer up

  he looked at me with despair in his
eyes

  no he said bitterly you wouldnt
desert me the way my lucks running
that would be too much to hope for
thats the way to look at it i
said slapping him on the back i
could see already that i was helping
him out of the doldrums what say
we have a quick drink i suggested
you can tell me all about it whats
her name

  its not a her he said
something serious then i said
patting him on the shoulder

  yes its serious he said shaking
my hand from his shoulder and for
gods sake i wish youd let me die in
peace good bye

  a cab had pulled up and before i
could say another word he was opening
the door and shouting an address to
the driver i was still standing there
with my mouth open when the cab shot
away from the curb and disappeared
around the corner

  poor chap must be in a hurry i
thought

  i realized then that i was getting
wet i couldnt remember right off the
bat why id left the club so i turned
around and went back in i had a few
drinks but i couldnt get poor point-
dexter off my mind

  the chap had really been in a stew
i shook my head sadly i knew how


fantastic adventures

he felt when a mans in a mess of
trouble himself he can sympathize with
another blokes hard luck

  of course i was in real trouble for
the past week id been trying to find
a good badminton racket but there
just werent any available and the
club tournament was only a month or so
away it was a simply hellish spot to
be in but id been carrying on as well
as i could keeping the old top lip stiff
and smiling when it hurt

  thats why i was able to understand
poor pointdexters condition

  and i decided that i simpfy couldnt
forsake the chap id look him up find
out what was troubling him and give
him a good old-fashioned fight talk

  but i didnt get around to it for a
couple of weeks i had worries of my
own and it wasnt until i found a de-
cent racket that i was able to put my
mind to anything then of course
i thought of pointdexter right away

  a couple of weeks had passed and he
hadnt been at the club in that time
no one had seen him around at any of
his old haunts so one morning i
grabbed a cab and drove out to his
home which is one of those big
rambling brownstone mansions on the
lake shore drive

  the butler opened the door

  what say i said tossing him my
hat

  good morning sir he said he
was a white haired old fellow named
mudkins he opened the door hesi-
tantly wont you come in

rjphe hallway was gloomy and dark
and there was a peculiar odor in
the air from the hallway i could see
the vast drawing room to my right with
its heavy black furniture and through
the high archway of this room the li-
brary was visible looking just too
deuced intellectual for my taste with

its dusty old leather-bound books
reaching from floor to ceiling

  i never liked pointdexters home i
couldnt figure out why he lived in the
creepy old place when he could afford
a snappy penthouse overlooking the
lake

  mudkins was looking at me rather
nervously

  is the old boy at home i asked

  yes master william is in his room
mudkins said but he hasnt been see-
ing anyone for the past few weeks
im not sure-

  hell see me i said slipping out
of my topcoat i just wont stand for
any nonsense what does he mean
shutting himself away from his friends
like this its not healthy ill drag
him down to the club for a bit of a
work-out do him good

  i do hope you can mudkins said
worriedly ill go up and tell him
youre here

 dont bother i know my way
around

  i trotted up the wide steps to the
second floor the hall was dark and
gloomy and the framed ancestors of
the pointdexter clan frowned down on
me from the wall as i strode along to
billys room the funny odor was
stronger now and i didnt like it i
decided mudkins must be having liver
and onions for breakfast

  i reached pointdexters room and
rapped briskly on the solid oak door
there was no sound from inside for
several minutes then his voice
sounded irritably

  who is it

  open up old fellow i called out
youre in for a pleasant surprise its
marmaduke

  he evidently didnt catch my name
for he shouted for gods sake go
away

  tut tut i said reprovingly
the man who cried werewolf



where are the gracious old point-
dexter manners i rapped again

  finally i heard his footsteps and then
the door was jerked open

  what do you want he cried

  i was slightly startled at his appear-
ance he was wearing an old stained
smoking jacket and his shirt looked as
if he hadnt changed it in days there
was a three or four day growth of
beard on his face and his hair was
hanging in his eyes and i didnt like
the light in his eye too feverish

  greetings i said you look a
mess old chap if youre trying to look
picturesque youre overdoing it

  he glared at me

  what difference does it make what
i look like

  i shook my head sadly pointdexter
had once been the nattiest member of
our group we were always trying to
steal his ties this breakdown was
disillusioning

  come come now i said one
cant just let ones self go to seed can
one one has ones appearance to
think of hasnt one one must-
for gods sake pointdexter cried
stop babbling about one this and
one that what do you want any-
way

  his tone was a bit sharp i decided
i would have to deal firmly with him
after all it was for his good

  i want to talk to you i said fixing
him with a cool steady gaze

  he misinterpreted my expression
stop goggling like a fish and go
away i dont want to talk to you
yes you do i said you iust dont
know your own bind

  he stared wiiily at me for an in-
stant and then he ran a hand dis-
tractedly through his hair his shoul-
ders slumped wearily

  come on in he muttered and
opened the door wide

  i walked into his room the shutters
were drawn and the only light was
streaming from a pair of wall sockets
there was a huge desk in one corner
piled high with thick books bound in
black leather and then i saw what
was causing the unpleasant odor
there was a bunsen burner on the desk
and above it hung a cauldron from
which a murky yellow smoke streamed
upward

  the smoke was harsh bitter and sul-
phurous it hung about the room in
gloomy clouds i coughed and peered
at pointdexter

  why dont you open a window i
asked

  if you find it unpleasant here you
can always leave he said

phat was true and it made me feel
   better

  i glanced around against one wall
there was a lab bench covered with
sheets of paper on which were scrawled
strange characters and designs an-
other bunsen burner was blazing bright-
ly there under a small porcelain beaker
filled with a burbling green mess the
whole set-up was gloomy and mysteri-
ous

  i waved a hand at the books and
chemical apparatus

  what goes i asked are you
studying to be a mad scientist

  pointdexter had slumped down in a
deep chair and he was lighting a stubby
black pipe he stared at me through
the swirling drifts of smoke

  perhaps i am he said quietly
there was a queer look in his eyes

  pull yourself together old chap i
said sharply youre letting yourself
go to pot it wont do at all what you
need is a good dose of sunshine and
fresh air after all i said cheerfully
things are never as black as they look
supposing you tell your uncle marma-


fantastic adventures

duke all about this trouble of yours
there isnt anything to tell he said
moodily he blew smoke around for a
while and then he said i suppose you
know i was rejected by the army
hadnt heard a thing about it i
said people keep things from me
whats the trouble

  bad heart pointdexter said its
all right if i take things easy but it
wouldnt stand much excitement his
face was bitter so i can sit around
and grow old while everybody else is
out fighting and dying for their coun-
try

  thats too bad i said i couldnt
see just why it was bad but after all
pointdexter obviously looked at things
differently than i did

  too bad he muttered staring at
me you havent the faintest idea how
damn bad it is you cant understand
how i feel theyll probably grab you
in a minute

  yes i said running a finger about
the inside of my collar i guess they
will

  i lit a cigarette nervously hang it
all im ready to go when they call me
but i dont sit around dwelling on the
idea theres something morbid about
getting up at an hour when the roosters
are just turning over for another snooze
the mere thought brings out a nervous
sweat on my forehead

  youre healthy pointdexter con-
tinued gloomily youre just the kind
they want youll be able to get out
with the rest of them and blow those
devils to hell he laughed harshly
but im only good for sitting around
and reading communiques god he
cried suddenly its enough to drive a
man out of his mind

  i suddenly realized what pointdex-
ters trouble was with a truly brilliant
flash of intuition i knew that he was
brooding because he couldnt get into

the army he had taken his rejection
pretty seriously and he was letting it
warp his entire existence i felt pleased
with myself for figuring this out

  now look old fellow i said you
dont want to let this thing ruin your
life i waved my hand at the pile of
ancient books and the bubbling beakers
that were stinking up the room
whats the point in locking yourself
away with this junk youll ruin your
health cooped up in this room dash
it its not right what do you expect
to get out of all this studying youre
no kid in a university anymore youre
liable to hurt yourself using your brain
at your age leave that stuff to the
youngsters who have the stamina and
strength to stand it

  well pointdexter said it takes
my mind off myself it helps me to
forget i feel that if the army doesnt
want me im no good to anyone and it
doesnt matter what i do with myself
so i am forsaking this modern life com-
pletely my studies and experiments
are following the line of thought that
was developed in the middle ages and
in that line im making definite prog-
ress ive come across some very fas-
cinating information

  thats all very well i said but
you cant burn the candle at both ends
why dont you leave this stuff alone for
a while and go out and get some fresh
air

  pointdexter looked at me strangely

  that seems to be your cure for
everything he said dryly i cant just
walk out of here now ive gone too
far ive got to see my experiments
through

  well maybe i could help you i
said making a big gesture i took
freshman chemistry at college itd
probably all come back to me with a
little practice what the devil kind of
experiments are you doing anyway
the man who cried werewolf



ointdexter stood up and lit his
dead pipe his hand was trembling
slightly as he tossed the matcli away
with a quick nervous gesture

  did you ever hear of the science of
demonologv he asked

  no i said and from the sound of
the word ill make a quick guess that
i wouldnt be intrigued has it got
something to do with demons

  pointdexter smiled slowly

  yes he murmured you might say
that it has quite a lot to do with demons
there are many legends which today
are derided as superstition but which
actually have a firm basis in fact take
the common story of the werewolf

  you take it i said and jolly well
keep it

  pointdexter picked up a heavy black
book from his desk

  this interesting volume he said
contains a complete and exhaustive
summary of all of the common varie-
ties of werewolves also it has a thor-
ough presentation of the methods used
to change people from their human form
into the forms of beasts there is a
chart of all the charms to be used
against these human beasts and also the
means of restoring them to their human
forms quite thorough isnt it

  i nodded thoughtfully impressed in
spite of myself the book did seem to
cover the ground pretty well of course
why such unpleasant ground had to be
covered at all was another question

  seems to be quite complete i said
who wrote it

  a mad monk in the twelfth cen-
tury pointdexter answered

  he must have been a jolly soul i
muttered

  pointdexter smiled you dont seem
particularly impressed with my little
hobby

  hang it all i said its all right
for a hobby but you shouldnt go loony

over a thing like this werewolves i
dare say are fine enough in moderate
doses but a steady diet cant be good
for a bloke

  it doesnt make any difference what
happens to me he said morosely i
have the feeling that my life is over
anyway if i could have died in the
service of my country i should have
been quite happy but since i cant do
that nothing makes much difference ill
bury myself in these tomes of forgotten
lore and if i gain an atom of peace and
forgetfulness through my experiments i
shall be well repaid

  youre just talking nonsense i said
with considerable heat if you must
shut yourself away and study why dont
you study something worthwhile mu-
sic or art what good will all this pok-
ing about in demonclogy do you what
would you do with a werewolf if you
had one ill be darned if id let you
pass it off on me

  pointdexter smiled slowly and opened
the heavy book which he still held in his
hands

  what would i do with a werewolf
he murmured thats an extremely
interesting question

  your darn right it is i said tri-
umphantly never thought of that did
you

  marmaduke pointdexter said will
you do me a favor

  righto anything you ask
  please go away

  righto i said i figured it was the
least i could do for the chap

  thank you marmaduke he said
with such relief in his voice that i was
touched i felt id taken a load off his
mind

  and so i went away

pow the average chap might have
figured at this point that his duty
was done and with a clear conscience


fantastic adventures

gone on about his own business but
there is sterner stuff in me and i re-
solved to continue my good work

  my first visit to pointdexter had un-
doubtedly done much good but i de-
cided that i would stick to the job until
i had so to speak effected a complete
recovery

  but the best laid plans sometimes go
wherever best laid plans go when they
arent the best laid plans and what with
one thing and another i didnt get
around to see pointdexter for several
weeks

  mudkins answered my ring and he
looked relieved to see me

  wont you please come in he said
nervously

  righto hows your simon legree
these days

  i gave him my hat and stick and
glanced without enthusiasm about the
gloomy house

  is he still pottering around in his
room

  oh yes sir and i am becoming very
worried about his health mudkins
said he hasnt left the house since
that day you were here except for a few
walks after dark

  ha i said thats an encouraging
sign nothing like a draft of night air
to cure what ails you is he upstairs
now

  mudkins looked more worried than
ever

  i-i dont think so sir he didnt
return last night from his walk he left
the back door open and it was still open
this morning and theres no one in his
room the door however seems to be
locked ive called several times but
he doesnt answer really sir i dont
know quite what to make of it

  ill go up and have a look i said

  i trotted up the stairs and knocked
loudly on pointdexters door there
was no answer i tried the handle and

the door gave when i applied a little
weight it wasnt locked just stuck

  there was a light burning on the
desk but the rest of the room was in
shadow obviously pointdexter had
left the light on intending to return but
something had delayed him

  i walked to the desk picked up one
of the heavy books and began leafing
through it i wondered if pointdexter
was still hopped up on that silly de-
monology business

  there were several paragraphs under-
lined in heavy pencil but as i started to
read them i heard a low growl from
one of the darkened corners of the room

  i jumped about six inches and the
book fell from my hands turning
around i saw two red eyes staring at
me from the darkness the growl
sounded again i am not a connoisseur
of growls but there was a certain cheery
warmth lacking in this particular effort
in fact the growl could only be de-
scribed as definitely antagonistic

  nice doggy i said weakly

  that was only a guess but it turned
out to be a good one for as i spoke
the shadows moved and a huge bristling
dog padded slowly from the corner and
regarded me with large gleaming eyes
he was a big dog and his coat was a
rough gray there was something about
his long flat head and the huge fangs
visible in his open mouth that made me
suddenly wish that i had come equipped
with a suit of armor and an elephant
gun

  nice doggy i said again as it made
no move to approach but continued to
regard me solemnly

  my composure returned somewhat
after all a dog is a dog and if one
adopts an intelligent attitude toward
them there is nothing to be worried
about

  i wondered briefly how this big brute
had gotten up here in pointdexters
the man who cried werewolf



room of course it was none of my
business but i still wondered if point-
dexter wanted to keep a slavering crea-
ture like this in his rooms that was his
privilege

  since pointdexter obviously wasnt
home and since i had no desire to linger
in the company of this solemn dog i
decided to leave at once

  i left the room and went downstairs

  mudkins met me in the hall

  hes not there is he

  nope hes still a w o l but
where did he get that big brute of a
dog i asked

  dog mudkins voice was puzzled
i dont know what you mean sir

  i was opening my mouth to tell him
when a voice from upstairs called my
name with some surprise i recognized
the voice as pointdexters

  marmaduke he called again
please come up will you

  theres the master now mudkins
said smiling with relief he must have
been up there all the time because he
couldnt have come in without my know-
ing

go i went back upstairs pointdexter
was standing in the door of his room
he was dressed as he had been the first
time i saw him but he looked seedier
than ever and his face was pale and
drawn there was a wild light in his
eyes which i noticed with alarm too
much studying was telling on the chap
i felt

  he took me by the arm and prac-
tically jerked me into his room he
closed the door quickly and locked it

  i looked about the room cautiously

  be careful i said theres a big
dog up here i wouldnt want to step
on him he didnt look as if he had a
tolerant mind

  but the dog was gone i glanced
everywhere but i didnt see him to

tell the truth i was relieved

  you say you saw a dog here in my
rooms pointdexter asked i noticed
that he was staring at me strangely i
straightened my tie boldly it was one
of his but i felt i might bluff my way
through if he made any charges but
he seemed concerned with other things

  are you sure you saw a dog he
asked again

  well i might have been mistaken
i said i thought for a minute putting
everything i had into it then i shook
my head no i couldnt be mistaken
i did see a dog here

  really now pointdexter said
laughing weakly thats a rather wild
story whom do you expect to believe
that

  i thought this over and then i
laughed too the whole thing was per-
fectly silly a big dog in pointdexters
room how ridiculous

  when i stopped laughing i said
but i did see the brute you know

  pointdexter twisted his hands to-
gether and began pacing

  i shouldnt tell you this marma-
duke he said but- he stopped pac-
ing and faced me squarely there was
a dog here

  thats what i thought i said i
felt relieved at having my opinion vin-
dicated

  but it wasnt an ordinary dog
pointdexter said watching me closely

  ill say it wasnt i said with con-
siderable feeling if he were the norm
for dogs they would never have crept
into the hearts of man as they have
done

  i want to ask you something mar-
maduke pointdexter said i want
you to promise me never to mention see-
ing that dog here

  righto i said ill be very happy
to forget that that particular dog ever
existed


fantastic adventures

  you see pointdexter went on that
dog is-er-a prize dog and i dont
want anyone to know about him until
hes ready for show you understand
that dont you

  of course no word shall pass my
lips but what class are you going to
enter him in wolfhound

  pointdexter winced and turned away
from me

  i was afraid that i had hurt his feel-
ings

  just a gag i said im sure hes
a fine dog whatever his class

  i looked at my watch

  ive got to rtin i said big bad-
minton match this afternoon wish me
luck

  i stopped at the door

  hows the black magic coming
along

  pointdexter turned to me and his face
was in the shadow

  about as i expected he said his
voice sounded terribly tired and sad

  well what could you expect study
and research are fine things without a
doubt but they can become depressing

  i left him then but frankly i was
worried about the chap obviously his
studies were doing him no good and he
was ruining his health living in that
airless sunless room breathing sulphur
fumes all the day

  i felt that i had done him a great
deal of good but the job wasnt done
yet and i asked myself can you de-
sert the bloke while he still needs you

  obviously i couldnt

  what to do i stewed over this for
some time my badminton game suf-
fered because of my concentration on
this problem but i was prepared to
make any sacrifice

  and finally as the old brain got
steaming on the job i figured out what
i would have to do

  it was a very simple plan but as far

as i could see it was foolproof and
that after all is what counted

  briefly i reasoned the cause of
pointdexters sad plight was his pre-
occupation with all of the parapher-
nalia that he had collected about him in
his room

tltaving reached this conclusion
after a week of grim thought i
proceeded to the next step the solu-
tion to this dilemma was obviously to
remove from pointdexter these things
which were ruining his health and
glooming up his mind

  that meant that a bit of the old
stealth was in order i would have to
sneak into the chaps room cart away
and destroy all of his books and chemi-
cal apparatus without his knowledge
that would take a bit of doing i
realized but the results would be worth
all of my labor

  i wondered briefly how pointdexter
would take it well there wouldnt be
much he could do about it the thing
would be done would be a fait ac-
compli before he became aware of my
little plan

  i felt very pleased with this reason-
ing and there was a certain machia-
vellian stealth required in the undertak-
ing that gratified me considerably

  one morning cheery and bright i
punched the bell at pointdexters

  mudkins opened the door invited me
in and looked at me with considerable
surprise

  whatever is the matter sir

  i was wearing baggy disreputable
clothes and a false mustache i
couldnt just barge into this bit of lar-
ceny and housebreaking as marma-
duke van milton could i

  its all right mudkin i said
this is just a disguise

  pardon sir but what is that thing
on your lip
the man who cried werewolf



  i reached up and discovered that my
mustache had slipped up to a perpendic-
ular position probably looked rather
odd that way

  ha ha i laughed sharp old dog
arent you

  mudkins seemed to shudder slightly
sorry sir but the word dog has a
most unhappy effect on me lately
ah i said youve seen point-
dexters mastiff i take it

  yes i have sir and a most fright-
ening animal it is the master keeps
it locked in the room with him all the
time i am becoming desperately wor-
ried theres something going on here
that isnt just right i know sir ive
got eyes and ears

  tut tut i said youre letting
your nerves get the best of you too
much protein in your diet probably
is the mad genius at home

  no sir he isnt he went out last
night for his usual late walk and he
hasnt returned

  excellent i said

  this was a choice bit of luck my
little job would have to be done while
pointdexter was away i had dropped
in on the chance that he might be out
but there was another little thing on
my mind

  how about the dog i asked

  the dog is evidently with the mas-
ter it is certainly not in the house
fine i said im going up to
pointdexters room be a good chap
and give me the high sign if he pops
back in unexpectedly

  but sir mudkins protested the
master gave me explicit instructions to
allow no one in his room while he was
away he was most emphatic about
it

  this is for his own good i said
determinedly

  mark my words hell thank us
both for this some day

and so i went upstairs to point-
dexters room the door was open
and i entered one glance convinced
me that things hadnt improved in my
absence the same general air of
gloom prevailed and both bunsen burn-
ers were going full blast under beakers
of smoking yellow liquids books were
piled everywhere and the floor was lit-
tered with sheets of paper covered with
pointdexters feverish scrawl

  i took off my coat and rolled up my
sleeves my first official act was to
open both windows wide pull back the
shutters and let the strong sun splash
into the room things began to look
better immediately

  i turned off the bunsen burners and
dumped the contents of the beakers
into the wash bowl the steaming sul-
phurous liquid hissed and sizzled as i
turned on the cold water faucet and
let the clean water flush it down the
drain and that did away with the
smoke problem

  the clear keen autumn air whipped
through the room driving out the rank
aroma of the smoking fumes i took a
deep relieved breath pointdexter
would be a new man after spending a
few hours in this glorious smoke-free
atmosphere

  the books were next i felt like a
literary carrie nation as i bundled
them up and carried them into the hall-
way to dump down the incinerator
chute pointdexter would have trouble
retrieving them i thought cheerfully
for a roaring fire was blazing in the
furnace and when the books fell into
the chute they were on their way to be-
ing embers

  there must have been fifty or sixty
of the heavy leather bound books to
dispose of but when i finished the job
i felt a vast sense of relief that i
felt was that

  when i returned to pointdexters


fantastic adventures

room i noticed the sheets of paper on
the floor marked with his scrawled
writing they were arranged on the
floor in what seemed to be a deliberate
design as if someone had left them for
a child to read as it crawled about the
floor

  just another indication of point-
dexters general squirreliness

  i scooped them up and with the last
remaining books dumped them down
the incinerator i smiled happily as i
returned and examined pointdexters
room there was certainly a vast im-
provement over what it had been a half
hour before

  all the books were gone his own fev-
erish notes were consigned forever to
oblivion and the mess he had been
cooking under the bunsen burners
would no longer be filling the room with
its choking vapors

  i felt cheerfully contented the job
was done thoroughly and completely
and i felt that pointdexter would be a
new man from henceforth onward

  at that point i heard a howling full-
throated bark from the downstairs re-
gion of the house and a moment later
the great gray dog of pointdexters
charged wildly into the room

  it glared at me with red-rimmed eyes
and then swung its head about the
room as if it were looking for some-
thing when it completed its inspec-
tion it started loping about the room
raising its head occasionally to howl
mournfully

  frankly i was puzzled i had never
seen a dog act quite this way before
it paid no attention to me at all for
which i was humbly grateful the big
brute just continued to lope about the
place rather desperately and when it
passed the spot on the floor where
pointdexters papers had been arranged
it lifted its long snout and howled piti-
fully

  mudkins appeared at the open door

  what do you suppose is wrong with
him sir he asked worriedly ive
never heard him howl like this before

  probably disappointed in love i
hazarded has pointdexter come in
yet

  no sir he hasnt hes never
stayed out this long before and it has
me worried

  the dog had stopped howling for
which i was glad it was stretched out
on the floor with its nose buried in its
paws occasionally it lifted its head
and stared at me with the damnedest
look-as if it were accusing me of
something

  the brutes stare made me feel rather
uncomfortable and since there wasnt
any point in my hanging around any
longer i said goodbye to mudkins and
toddled off

  and thats that queer business
wasnt it

jyjarmaduke finished this much
of his story and turned to me
with a bright cheerful smile

  i said odd business what he re-
peated what do you make of it

  i ordered another drink and my hand
was trembling as i raised it to my lips
my collar felt uncomfortably tight and
there was a damp sweat on my fore-
head

  i didnt know what to say or think
marmadukes story was so fantastic
and its implications were so horrible
that my mind just seemed numb

  have you heard from pointdexter
since then i finally managed to ask

  marmaduke shook his head

  not a word the bloke just disap-
peared i dropped in on mudkins sev-
eral times but theres been no sign of
pointdexter around there since then

  i ordered another drink i felt i
was going to need it
the man who cried werewolf



  and what about the dog

 the dog marmaduke looked
puzzled oh yes pointdexters dog
well mudkins and i talked that situa-
tion over and did the only possible thing
under the circumstances you see the
brute hung around pointdexters room
ever since that day i burned all of
pointdexters papers and books
wouldnt budge out of there just
howled and moaned and lay on the
floor refusing to eat so we had to
take stern measures

  the glass in my hand crashed to the
floor

  my god you didnt kill him i
cried

  marmaduke took out his handker-
chief and carefully wiped away a few
flecks of the drink from his trousers
then he put the handkerchief away
and waved to the bartender for another
drink

  what did you say he asked

  did you kill pointdexters dog i
asked and the words almost strangled
me coming out

  oh no marmaduke said cheer-
fully we wouldnt do that mud-
kins and i crated him up one day and
shipped him off to the wags

 the wags

 yes the army dog corps we
figured pointdexter would like to have
his dog serving as long as he wasnt
able to

  marmaduke picked up his drink and
sipped it reflectively

  funny thing he murmured the
dog seemed to know what we were do-
ing as a matter of fact it seemed
quite cheerful about the whole thing
interesting what he put his drink
back on the bar and shook his head
but id still like to know what hap-
pened to old pointdexter

  so would i

the end

earth possesses two stratospheres

 according to dr henryk anctowski
-a well known polish meteorologist who is
-  now at work at the smithsonian insti-
tute the earth possesses two stratospheres above
its middle latitudes instead of one as is com-
monly believed this theory is based on a study
of the radiosonde data that was obtained by the
instruments sent to very high altitudes by means
of balloons by the u s weather bureau

  the stratosphere we all know about starts at
the place where the atmosphere reaches its low-
est temperature and does not get any colder
with increasing height this region is called the
tropopause and at the equator it is about 
miles above the earths surface from the equa-
torial point the tropopause slopes downward
toward the poles and thus the entire earth is
surrounded by an atmospheric roof

 but dr anctowski has been studying his
data which indicates that above the tropopause
located at the temperate zones the temperature
remains constant for a great distance up and
then the temperature once again starts to fall
until it reaches a new low temperature that is
constant at a very high level he thus con-
cludes that a second tropopause exists at the
middle latitudes making a separation of another

stratosphere the fact that there are daily
changes in the suns heat has long been known
and also that these changes take place in a com-
plex series of cycles further facts uncovered
by dr anctowskis research is that these daily
changes in the suns heat causes the tropopause
to move up and down from day to day and this
may have a pronounced effect on the earths
weather

  if the earth had no atmosphere the changes
in the suns heat would be felt instantaneously
on the earths surface but since the suns rays
have to travel through our  mile atmosphere
their effects are slowed up moreover the action
of winds clouds and other factors all act on
the rays trying to reach us from the sun when
the changes in the suns heat effect the level of
the tropopause at the equator these changes
move in wave-like motion toward the north and
south pole this tropopause change produces a
change in the height of the clouds and in the
movements of air masses above the earths sur-
face and they affect the amount of the worlds
rainfall

  further research along this line may result in
more accurate weather predictions in the near
future

 five thousand dollars for a rope was
the strangers offer and he might have
enslaved the world had he kept his word

 graham standlee was
deep in a pile of inventory
sheets an unlighted cigar
clamped between his bulldog jaws
when timid knuckles touched the glass
of his office door

  come on in standlee roared

  the door swung inward just enough
to admit a bald head above a weak-
featured face

excuse me mr standlee sir
whaddayuh want now poindexter
godsakes cant the houseware section
run ten minutes without me being on
the floor

  the glasses on mr poindexters
small nose began to quiver as the hue
of standlees neck changed from red to
magenta

  i-i beg your pardon sir but
theres a customer in the department
who wants to buy a-a rope

  the cigar described a savage circle
without leaving the buyers teeth
well godsakes sell him a rope thats

your job aint it

  yes sir but he really doesnt want
to buy a rope i mean he does want a
rope-

  poindexter caught a glimpse of the
mounting conflagration in the buyers
eyes and hurried to finish before it
erupted

  -but he wants us to make it
standlees anger switched to incre-
dulity whaddayuh mean-make a
rope this is a department store not
a factory godsakes mans a screw-
ball throw him outl

  the clerk nodded yes sir ill
tell him to look elsewhere i knew he
must be insane to offer five thousand
dollars for such an item why he
could-

standlee barked shuddupl he
pried his bulk out of the swivel chair
waddled over to the frightened sales-
man and took him forcibly by the arm
how much he demanded

  why- that is- five thousand


fantastic adventures

dollars but he must be era-

  for making a rope hunh

  yes sir but-

  get going said l graham stand-
lee well make the guy his rope
you hear and if he wants to hang
somebody with it well use you

rjhe man was standing in one of
the aisles looking at a vacuum
cleaner display poindexter with
standlee in tow approached him and
said

  excuse me mr uh-

  senoj the man said

  poindexter looked blank i beg
pardon

  my name the man said is senoj
mr senoj was tall and very thin
his narrow face was dominated by a
nose reminiscent of a halberd blade
and which was set between very small
and very black eyes his black hair
was cut short and it bristled he had a
peculiar blank almost frozen expres-
sion on his face

  standlee nudged the little salesman
aside and put out his hand my
name is standlee mr senoj im in
charge of this department i under-
stand you want us to make a rope for
you

  that is true mr senoj spoke
very precisely it gave his words some-
thing of a foreign sound

  standlee took back his unshaken
hand excellent he said warmly
youve come to the right place now
if youll just tell us what grade of
hemp-

  i shall explain senoj said i am
residing at the central hotel yester-
day there was a fire in my room a
valuable rope was destroyed with my
luggage i burned my hands trying to
save the rope notice

  he held out his hands for the others
to see the palms and fingers of both

were swathed in bandages

  i must immediately have another
rope mr senoj continued i have
managed to secure the necessary ma-
terials but because of my burned
fingers i cannot weave it myself for
that reason i have come to you

  do you have the materials with
you standlee asked

  the man pointed to a gladstone bag
on the floor at his feet they are
in there

  okay standlee said you go
sit down someplace mr senoj ill
have a couple men here pretty soon
and then well get to work oh ah-of
course making a rope to specifications
is a pretty expensive job and-

  i mr senoj said will pay five
thousand dollars will that be satis-
factory

  standlee was beaming certainly
sir godsakes yes

  an hour later two men in coveralls
arrived from the acme cordage com-
pany in response to the buyers frantic
call they accompanied mr senoj into
a cubbyhole workshop at the rear of the
houseware section and the odd cus-
tomer closed the door with firm polite-
ness in standlees face

  almost two hours went by before
that door opened again standlee who
had been hovering in the vicinity dur-
ing that time sprang eagerly forward
as the two workmen emerged

  mr senoj a contented expression
softening his sharp features remained
standing in the doorway

  everything satisfactory sir
panted standlee

  i believe so mr senojs small
black eyes were gleaming with a
strange almost phosphorescent light
however i must examine the finished
article carefully to be sure you had
best tell the men to wait in case al-
terations are necessary
they gave him a rope



  sure standlee agreed mind if
i give the rope the once-over with you
id like to see a five thousand dollar
hunk of hemp

  mr senoj glanced carefully around
then put his lips close to the fat mans
ear

even you cannot look at the rope
he whispered a matter of the utmost
secrecy national defense you know
the door swung shut leaving the
buyer on the outside

  godsakes breathed l graham
standlee

  

jphe phone on john shannons desk
   rang sharply

  shannon a lank sprawling man with
a fine aristocratic head and intelligent
face took his heels off an open drawer
put down his paper and picked up the
receiver

  special service shannon speaking
   yeah standlee whats on your
mind  so  so   well of all
the nutty- all right ill send some-
body up there

  he replaced the receiver then flipped
the switch on the inter-office communi-
cations set miss selby whos out
there    witek send him in

  the door from the outer office opened
and a young man with a blond head
strong body and engaging grin came in
want me chief

  yeah shannon said his lips
twitching back a smile and for the
tenth time quit calling me chief
youre working for drey fuss  sons
not the police force

  yes sir

  okay now go up to the eighth
floor and see standlee the houseware
buyer he just called and gave me
some screwy yarn about somebody
stealing a rope youve been asking
for something besides routine assign-
ments since i hired you a week ago

you havent got any special job to
do for a couple of hours yet have you
no sir i just got back from the
bank with the payroll money

  all right better leave that gun
under your arm with miss selby
youre not supposed to pack a rod
while on duty in the store you know
now get on up to houseware

  right away witek said eagerly
moving for the door and thanks
chief

  he was gone before shannon could
reach for something to throw

  joe witek found the houseware buy-
er with several clerks and two men in
coveralls outside a cubbyhole office at
the rear of the eighth floor there was
a great deal of loud talking and many
heated gestures

  the young store detective found l
graham standlee in the center of the
group and identified himself what
seems to be the trouble mr standlee
he asked

  the buyer tugged at an already
wilted collar dont that bum shan-
non tell you nothing he shouted
godsakes we been robbed

  of what joe said his face dark-
ening at the uncomplimentary de-
scription of his boss

  of a rope

  that wouldnt amount to much
would it joe asked innocently

  standlee appeared to be having an
apoplectic stroke  very much he
panted is five thousand dollars pea-
nuts godsakes

  witek said in a dazed voice five
thou- maybe youd better explain this
from the beginning

  the buyer managed to control his
choler long enough to relate what had
taken place

  we waited two hours he con-
cluded bitterly for this guy senoj
to come out when he didnt i finally


fantastic adventures

opened the door and looked in the
room was empty the dirty crook had
skipped out with five thousand dollars
worth of rope and id give five
grand to know how he did it too i
saw him shut the door i stayed in
front of it every minute of those two
hours that guy never came out

  joe witek grinned now look sir
he mustve come out you said your-
self he isnt in there maybe the win-
dow-

  window standlee howled there
aint no window you dumbskull

  the store detective kept his temper
maybe id better look the room over
he suggested

tt doesnt take long he discov-
ered to examine a room six feet
square there was a table in the cen-
ter of the floor a cobweb in one corner
near the ceiling - and nothing else
the only break in the four walls was
the single door

  joe came out shaking his head
he mustve sneaked out when you
werent looking mr standlee he
said only thing possible

  the rotund little buyer sputtered
a string of sounds that joe managed
to translate into a long uncomplimen-
tary statement regarding the inefficien-
cy of the entire special service de-
partment joe tired of it finally and
interrupted the outburst

  did this guy senoj say anything
about himself where he works or
lives

  poindexter the clerk who had been
fluttering about the two men gave the
answer

  he was staying at the central ho-
tel he said thats where the fire
occurred in which he lost his original
rope

  joe witeks face brightened now
were getting some place

  he found a house phone called shan-
non and gave him a brief explanation
of what had happened

  standlee was at his elbow when he
hung up the buyer had recovered
somewhat from his agitation what
are you going to do he asked

  take a crack at the central hotel
any crook whod steal five thousand
dollars standlee said darkly
wouldnt give his right address

  joe shrugged anyway its worth
a try its a cinch he didnt leave any-
thing here to go on

  the store detective went to the locker
room for his hat then caught a taxi
and rode the few blocks to the central
hotel inside he sought out evans
the hotel detective and identified him-
self

  ill say we had a fire here yester-
day the officer exclaimed in response
to witeks query come damn near
being a bad one too gutted room 
and just about ruined everything in


  do you know the guests names in
those two rooms

  sure woman named barnes was
in  guy named sandow or some-
thing like that in  the barnes
dame was smoking in bed and-

  was it senoj joe interrupted
hunh oh in  senoj yeah
thats the name

  was he transferred to another
room

  naw he checked out right away
not that he had anything left to check
out though the fire got every last bit
of his luggage well probably get
sued for damages the hotel detective
concluded cheerfully

  joe frowned did he leave a for-
warding

  evans shrugged search me lets
ask at the desk

  it turned out that senoj had not left
they gave him a rope



a forwarding address nor did his
registration card prove of value it
read simply t senoj city

  joe scratched his blond head looks
like were licked he admitted rueful-
ly poor old standlee hell never
get over that five grand loss

  he turned away then swung back
as a thought struck him

  wait a minute he said what
about senojs burned luggage maybe
thatll give me something to work on
the hotel detective grunted if
you want to paw through a mess of
wet ashes its okay by me and thats
all there is too that fire wasnt kid-
ding

  ill take a crack at it anyway
joe said i got nothing to lose
two traveling bags and a small
charred trunk had been placed in an
otherwise empty storeroom in the base-
ment evans indicated the two bags
with the toe of his shoe

  those belonged to senoj he ex-
plained help yourself

  the bags had been burned into al-
most unrecognizable lumps by the fury
of the flames joe his hands pro-
tected by a pair of canvas gloves bor-
rowed from the hotel fireman began to
paw through the ruins

jje was laboriously sorting through
a collection of buttons and frag-
ments of cloth from the first bag when
a phone call took evans upstairs leav-
ing joe alone

  he squatted on his heels and tackled
the second bag it was in even worse
condition if possible than the first
determinedly he clawed away a mass
of charred cloth disclosing a fused
collection of shaving and toilet articles
a large bottle of what evidently had
once been after-shave lotion had broken
from the heat of flames drenching a
short length of smoke-blackened ma-

terial which lay beneath it

  a hunk of rope joe said aloud
very carefully he took up the grimy
foot-length object ill bet this is
whats left of the rope he had standlee
duplicate

  for some unaccountable reason he
felt his scalp prickle holding the
fragment gingerly in one hand he went
into the hotel boiler-room turned on a
faucet over a deep basin and let hot
water flow over the rope

  gradually under the water and joes
gentle rubbing the coating of grime
began to fade finally he withdrew
the rope shut off the water and re-
moving his gloves carefully dried it
with paper toweling

  in its restored state the short length
of material had become a thing of
beauty an intricate pattern formed
of differently colored strands of hemp
made it an intriguing mystery

  his eyes followed the complex de-
sign as he slowly revolved the rope in
his bare hands

  a peculiar sensation of lassitude be-
gan to steal into his mind his fingers
were taking on a deadening inertia the
bit of rope seemed suddenly to swell
in his hands the weird weave expand-
ing    expanding    then a swirl of
blackness enveloped him there was a
sensation of falling and he lost con-
sciousness

chapter ii

joe witek opened his eyes he
was standing in a stiff strained at-
titude the rope still clenched tightly
in his hands

  he shuddered violently drawing
back his right arm he flung the rope
from him with all his strength and
watched it disappear among the trees

  with a sigh of relief he turned away
and    trees
so

fantastic adventures

  hey wait a minute he gasped
where am i

  a gently rolling plain stretched to
the four horizons dotting the land-
scape were numerous small groves of
trees he was standing at the edge of
one and through the leaves the hot
rays of the mid-day sun dappled the
ground about him

  a sudden weakness that seemed to
center in his knees forced him to a
sitting position on the lush grass he
fumbled for a cigarette lit it and found
the first lungful of smoke a comforting
touch of reality in a personal world
gone mad

  for perhaps half an hour he sat there
his bewildered mind could give no
sane explanation for the abrupt transi-
tion from the basement of the central
hotel to this rural setting

  he stood up finally and started
resolutely off in the direction he was
facing since nothing in his experience
could furnish a solution to his prob-
lem he meant to find somebody and
ask questions    many questions

  twenty minutes later he topped a
small hill and saw less than half a
mile ahead the blunt square outline
of a small white house near it stood
a red barn-like structure and two tiny
outhouses

  spurred on by evidence that he was
not alone in these unfamiliar surround-
ings joe set out at a trot toward the
distant house while he was still sev-
eral hundred yards away the rear door
of the dwelling opened and a man step-
ped out one hand shading his eyes
from the sun as he watched joe come
forward

  hello mister joe shouted while
still yards away the unmasked re-
lief in his voice was almost ludicrous
he rushed up hand outthrust his face
split by a mighty grin say am i
glad to see you i

  the other regarded joes out-
stretched hand with wondering eyes
he was a tall slender man of perhaps
sixty with a thick growth of gray hair
and a strong face remarkably unlined
in one of his age

  what do you want me to give you
he asked uncertainly

  joe witeks hand fell limply to his
side the question had been asked in
a language totally unfamiliar to his
ears yet he had understood perfect-
ly the sounds had seemed to create
a series of rapid pictures in other
words he had actually seen the ques-
tion instead of hearing it

  he said look mister just tell me
one thing where am 

  the mans frank almost child-like
gaze changed from wonder to abrupt
interest

 are you new-born he asked
breathlessly

  the store detective was suddenly
angry do i look like a baby he
demanded his mouth hardened into
a thin line listen all were doing is
standing here shooting questions at
each other all i want to know is
where the hell im at and how i can
get a train back to center city i
got a job brother and i dont want
to lose it

  the man said wait here i will
call my mother

  he turned and re-entered the house
the door closing softly behind him

  joe thought if a guy that old cant
answer a civil question what kind of
information am i going to get from
some doddering old dame

jphe door opened and a girl in her
teens came out the man close at
her heels she wore a house-dress of
some odd shining gray material and
a wealth of soft dark hair framed her
young lovely face
they gave him a rope



  she said who are you and what
do you want with a mature direct-
ness as disconcerting in one so young
as had been the mans child-like be-
havior a few minutes before

  joe politely touched the brim of his
hat im sorry sis but you see im
kind of lost i asked your father here
how i could get back to center city
and-

  there is no such place in esre-
veria the girl said and this is my
son evad

  joe witek felt his senses reel he
took a deep breath said listen sis
i dont feel so good i dont know
where eserver-esveria-
esreveria

  -is and i dont think i want to
i just want to get back where i came
from so if youll direct me to the
nearest railroad station i wont trouble
you any further

  she heard him out carefully a tinge
of suspicion about her level blue eyes
then she said you dont talk like a
new-born and you certainly do not
act like one tell me have you buried
your coffin yet

  co-coffin joe stammered his
jaw sagging a surge of anger flooded
abruptly through him what the hell
kind of a gag are you trying to pull
she seemed entirely unmoved by his
rage in fact there was something of
compassion in her sudden smile

  what is your name son she
asked

  joes face burned at being referred
to as son by one easily ten years his
junior but he let it pass and gave his
name

  i am ecila the girl said perhaps
you are tired and hungry stay a little
while and have food with evad and me
perhaps later we can think of some
way to help you

  her words brought home to joe that

he was very tired he managed a weak
smile thanks ecila i sure hope
you can help me i mean and i
would like to sit down awhile

  she led the way into a small living-
room at the front of the house at
her invitation joe slumped onto a low
thickly padded couch and was sound
asleep before the girl had left the room

jje awoke in utter darkness from
some point in the house voices
mumbled too low for him to make out
the words

  he tossed back the light cover some-
one had draped over him while he slept
and sat up his shoes had been re-
moved and he fumbled about the floor
near the couch until he found them

  the mumble of voices grew louder
by the time he had knotted the laces
he could make out scattered words
spoken in a mans deep voice

  -might have been sent by them to
spy- he missed the rest of the sen-
tence

  i dont believe it joe recognized
ecilas voice pitched in a mixture of
anger and worry hes almost like a
new-born his clothing is like none i
have ever seen and he asks questions i
cannot understand he does not even
talk like us i do not know who he is
or where he came from but he is no
spy yorel

  joe witek walked softly to the closed
door from beyond which were coming
the voices by now his bewilderment
had grown so strong that it began to
turn to anger the conversation con-
cerned him of course he warmed to
ecilas quick defense of him and in
return found an object at which his
mounting rage might be directed the
man who had accused him of being
a spy

  hesitating no longer he twisted the
knob and strode resolutely into the
s

fantastic adventures

other room determined to put an end
to this mystery

  he was totally unprepared for what
he saw the room itself was evidently
the kitchen seated on either side of
a table were two girls ecila and a girl
of no more than six on the table was
a wicker bassinet occupied by a baby
in a gray dress who was propped into
a sitting position there was no sign
anywhere of the man whose voice joe
had heard

  the two girls and-strangely-the
infant were staring at him in hushed ex-
pectancy joe caught off balance by
the tender ages of his audience felt
his anger slip awa

  excuse me he muttered i heard
voices and thought id like to talk
things over theres a lot i want to
know

  theres a great deal we want to
know as well said the baby

  thats okay joe began automati-
cally anything    what

  they waited patiently for him to re-
sume after that final explosive word
but joe witek was not capable of con-
tinuing just then

  sympathy for his obvious bewilder-
ment showed in ecilas blue eyes she
said softly you slept well strange
one

  yeah joes head-shake was al-
most a shudder yeah    listen did
that kid say something

  the two girls looked at each other
their expressions puzzled but it was
the baby in the basket who put a defi-
nite end to joes doubt

  there is no child here if that is
what you mean it said sternly i am
yorel head of twelve clans with me
are my wife amme and my daughter
ecila

  oh it was the best joe could do

  and now yorel said firmly who
are you strange one

joe witek sought for a firm grip
on his slipping sanity but the ut-
ter incongruity of perfect speech in
strong masculine tones from the tiny
lips of an eight months infant made
the task a difficult one

  he said im joseph witek drey-
fuss  sons center city new york
the infants eyes bulged that is
your name

  it was joes turn to be wide-eyed
the muscles about those orbs were be-
ginning to ache so often were they
called into use

hell no im just joe witek from
center city youve heard of center
city 

  no replied the infant decisively
nor of anyone with two names you
are attempting to confuse us i demand
that you tell us truthfully who you
are

  but i did tell you joe wailed
nearer to panic with each new and im-
possible trend of the conversation

  wait father ecila interposed it
is clear that the strange one is being
truthful you must torture him no
further

  yorel shrugged you are young
my child you have not yet learned
how clever the senodab can be it
would be like them to send a spy so
different from us and themselves that
we would not suspect him

  joe witek had had enough

  okay he snapped if thats the
way you feel about it ill be running
along first though if it wont be
too much trouble maybe youll answer
just one question

  some of the hostility faded from the
infants eyes that seems reasonable
you will go away then

  youre darned right i dont like
being here any more than-

  yorel silenced him with a gesture
ask your question
they gave him a rope



  joe took a deep breath so much de-
pended on an affirmative answer to
what he was about to ask did you
he said slowly ever hear of a man
named senoj

  the reaction to the question was in-
stantaneous and electrifying the in-
fant seemed to shrink into one corner
of the bassinet one of the girls gave a
frightened gasp while the other sprang
to her feet a hand raised fearfully as
though to ward off a blow

  yorel was the first to recover then
you are from rorret why have you
singled us out we have been good
obedient people always we give the
proper shares of our crops and our
stock the collectors will tell you we
give them no trouble what do you
want of us

  the tone of abject fear in the babys
voice made the detectives skin creep
he said youve got me wrong yorel
listen im going to tell you the whole
story since you know who senoj is
you may be able to help me after all
they heard him out without inter-
ruption when joe had finished relat-
ing his incredible story yorel tugged
thoughtfully at his lip

  a strange tale he observed final-
ly so strange that it must be true
no man could put together such an im-
possible story unless such things had
actually happened to him so  i
believe you

  we will help you all we can un-
fortunately it will be little your only
chance is to go to rorret the walled
city it is there that you will find
senoj master of the senodab and ruler
of all esreveria senoj has been mas-
ter for thousands of years he is im-
mortal and controls the rites of birth
and death-the religion of all esre-
veria

  have you ever seen him joe
asked interestedly

  oh no he has no time for the
workers of esreveria but the col-
lectors tell of him occasionally when
they come for the senodabs share of
our crops and stock they say that
he spends six months of each year
locked away in a room of the palace
and none is permitted to go near him
during that time they say he talks
with powerful gods then who teach
him strange lore and the secret of ever-
lasting life

  ive got to get him joe said
thoughtfully if i can get my hands
on that rope of his i can return to
center city    where is rorret
yorel

three days journey to the east
there is a gravitrail a few hours to
the north of us follow it to rorret
good joe exclaimed ill start
the first thing in the morning

yrel shook his head no

   you must start now if you at-
tempt to travel during the day the
collectors will capture you it would
not serve your purpose to enter rorret
as a prisoner

  okay joe said finally ill get
start-

  bang-bang-bang

  the sound thundered through the
room both girls jumped to their feet
crying out with sudden terror in his
basket yorel kicked his tiny legs fran-
tically in an effort to sit up
bang-bang-bang 

  a muffled voice reached them from
the front of the house open open
in the name of senoj

  the collectors yorel cried his
small face convulsed with fright
someone must have reported your
presence here

  ecila sprang to the table and blew
out the candle plunging the room into
darkness quick she whispered to


fantastic adventures

joe out this door they mustnt
find you here

  the kitchen door swung back just
enough to allow the young detective
to slip through with a muttered word
of thanks he stepped onto the back
porch vaulted the low railing to the
ground below-and felt strong arms
encircle his body from behind

chapter 

the powerful arms of his un-
seen foe wrapped about him joe
witek acted stooping slightly he
reached back over his head and caught
the attacker about the neck with a
mighty tug aided by the leverage of
his own weight he flung the others
body in a swift arc across his shoulder
a high fear-filled cry tore at joes
ears ending abruptly as the heavy
figure crashed with a dull thud against
the ground

  releasing the unconscious man joe
bolted across the yard as though pur-
sued by demons there was no moon
but the faint light from the stars was
sufficient to prevent collision with any
objects in his path

  voices yelled from behind him and
he caught the sounds of pounding feet
then a thin streak of red fire lanced
through the air a few inches from his
ear and he winced under the brief
touch of intolerable heat

  a rail fence rose in his path so
swiftly was he moving that he had no
time to alter his course straining
every muscle he rose in a mighty leap
clearing the top bar by inches

  his feet came down upon a narrow
ribbon of close-clipped grass beyond
which loomed another fence instant-
ly joe turned to the north and raced
along the lawn-like trail which
stretched straight as a rulers edge
into the distance

  at last his laboring lungs forced him
down to a rapid walk and he stopped
altogether to listen for indication of
further pursuit

  the whispering silence of a rural
countryside was all about him alcove
the soft breeze in the grain field to his
left came the measured chirp of a
cricket a dogs bark reached him
faintly as though from across miles of
prairie

  joe witek realized then that he had
lost his feeling of helpless bewilder-
ment the clash at the farmhouse the
physical exertion required in his mad
dash for freedom had aroused his
fighting blood and sharpened his per-
ceptions he swung lightly along the
trail his blond head hatless held high
now and then he paused briefly to
listen for some sign of those whom
yorel had referred to as collectors

  he had progressed perhaps two miles
or so when one of his numerous glances
back along the path caught a momen-
tary flicker of light far to his rear

  he hesitated still watching and a
second later the light appeared again
larger now

  hastily joe looked about him seek-
ing some point of concealment beyond
the rail fence to his left was a broad
sweep of level plain that offered nothing
to serve as a hiding place to the right
was another stretch of level ground
dotted by low mound-like objects
which in the faint light he was un-
able to identify

  the pin-point of radiance began to
swell rapidly and joe waited no longer
quickly he slipped between the rails on
the trails right and dropped from sight
behind the nearest mound

  and none too soon almost im-
mediately the grass in the path became
visible under the glow of a strong light
and then moving slowly appeared
what at first glance seemed an oar-
they gave him a rope



less rowboat a headlight set in the
prow furnished illumination the fig-
ures of two men were seated in the bow
one of them behind a steering wheel
joe had time to observe no more than
those few details before the strange
vehicle had passed from sight

joe witek got dazedly to his feet
nothing in his experience could ac-
count for the type of locomotion he
had just witnessed for not only had
that strange craft been powered by an
absolutely silent motor but it floated
in thin air a few feet above the trail
like a captive balloon no wonder
the roadway was unmarked by passing
wheels

  joe sat weakly down on the low
ridge of earth and fumbled for a ciga-
rette he would rest awhile before
going on as he sat there inhaling
smoke with deep satisfaction he fell
to examining the raised ground beneath
him and discovered that a small slab
of stone had been set at one end of
the mound as his eyes grew accus-
tomed to the darkness he made out
similar slabs set at the heads of the
other ridges suddenly the truth
dawned on him

  theyre graves he gasped aloud
im in a cemetery

  the realization brought surprise but
nothing of panic at least he reflected
it was better to be in a graveyard than
in the hands of the collectors he
hadnt forgotten that lance-like streak
of fire that had almost burned him
loose from an ear

  he had just extinguished his ciga-
rette preparatory to starting back to
the pathway when it happened

  the ground beneath him began to
move

  with a single horrified shout joe
witek leaped straight into the air he
came down on hands and knees and re-

mained in that position petrified by
what he was witnessing

  a great crack had appeared in the
surface of the mound a crack that split
into a gap as a naked arm thrust up-
ward into view

  helpless to move the smallest muscle
joe witek watched the surface of the
grave disintegrate as an unclothed hu-
man form broke through the layer of
earth slowly it sat up in the now
visible coffin hesitated briefly then
rose unsteadily to its feet and turned
dark eyes on the kneeling awe-struck
young detective

  a voice literally from the sepulcher
croaked a question and the import
of the few words gave the final ma-
cabre touch to the entire incident

  you-are-my--j at her

  eeee yow yelled joe witek and
with the release of his vocal cords came
freedom to the rest of his body his
feet touched ground only twice before
he cleared the rail fence

  how far into the north he ran before
exhaustion overtook him he had no
way of knowing even then he did not
stop entirely but continued on at a
walk glancing nervously across his
shoulder at the trail behind

  three hours later joe witek was still
plodding along the roadway he had
paused to rest twice during that period
of time and was considering a third
when he caught a gleam of light far
ahead

  he drew to a stop eyes intent on the
sliver of light until satisfied it was sta-
tionary reasoning finally that it
emanated from some farmhouse beside
the road joe moved warily forward

  a small circular building of stone
loomed ahead of him light escaping
from beneath the drawn shade of a
window soundlessly joe crept up his
heart beating rapidly and applied an
eye to the narrow gap


fantastic adventures

jppour men clad in tunics of shining

  gray cloth sat about an oval table
on which a meal had been laid they
were conversing over the food their
words reaching joe clearly through the
open window

  hell be found senrab one of
them said through a full mouth a
dozen large kavars will be here by
morning

  daens should have reached rorret
by now observed a second i hope
hell get some action if we delay too
long the strange one may get away
where could he hope to go said
the first speaker our agents will re-
port his presence if he approaches a
farm and he cant possibly remain in
the fields or the woods

  silently joe left the window and
circled the building he found that it
fronted on another grassy trail this
one much wider than the one he had
been following it stretched due east
and west bisecting the narrower path
the road joe decided to rorret-and
to senoj

  he was on the point of setting out on
foot into the east when he caught sight
of the boat-like affair that had passed
him a few hours earlier it was rest-
ing on the ground now a few feet from
the wide road

  curiosity overruled caution joe
stepped gingerly into the craft and be-
gan to examine the series of levers and
buttons mounted on the dashboard
above each was a strange hieroglyph
labeling its use

  a daring thought leaped into his
mind here under his hand was the
means of rapid transportation to mr
senoj and his rope if only he could
solve the mechanism

  joe thrust out his jaw with sudden
resolve sometimes he told himself
a guy has to take chances without
further delay his fingers closed about

a switch-like leer and twisted it sharp-
ly to the left

  in complete silence the vehicle gave
an abrupt vertical jerk and then was
still joe glanced groundward and saw
that the ship was now hovering some
four feet above the surface

  with his heart in his throat he
flipped a second switch instantly a
scream like an enraged air-raid siren
split apart the silence of the night

  frantically joe slammed the lever
back to its original position but the
damage had been done

  the door of the hut banged open and
the four men came piling through
with hoarse shouts of anger they came
racing across the grass toward him

  it was no time for theorizing in one
almost continuous motion joe twisted
every lever and pushed every button
he could reach

  he had not long to wait for develop-
ments

  with a might whoosh he was un-
derway illumination from the head-
light drenching the countryside a
frantic tug at the wheel brought him
over the gravitrail and then he was
being swept along at such tremendous
speed that the fields on either side were
pressed into a grayish blur

  joe hung onto the wheel and prayed
nothing would loom in his path there
was nothing on the instrument panel
that resembled a speedometer making
it impossible to gauge his velocity ac-
tually he was moving far faster than he
dreamed but the absolute freedom
from vibration caused him to under-
estimate his speed

ceveral hours passed without inci-
cident the silent craft raced east-
ward with undiminished swiftness joes
spirits began to rise in ratio to the dis-
tance he was piling up between himself
and his enemies he had no idea as
they gave him a rope



to what part of the world he was in
but senoj and his rope held the answer
to that problem and he was on his way
to obtain that solution

  behind him the sky began to lose its
blackness and the grayish pink of dawn
spread across the western horizon even
the sun joe thought had become con-
fused in this mad world

  he noticed now a fact that had it
occurred to him earlier might have
caused him worry the gravitrail led
over hills and into an occasional valley
but always his ship maintained the same
distance from the surface rising at ele-
vations and sinking into depressions
evidently some sort of regulated pro-
pulsion ray automatically made neces-
sary adjustments

  it was just after his craft had topped
a rather high hill that joe witek was
shocked into the realization that his
wild ride was at an end poised mo-
tionless above the trail a few miles
ahead was a ship similar to his own but
considerably larger fanned out on
either side of it were other such craft
perhaps a score in all despite the dis-
tance he could see their crews vvatching
his approach and as his ship narrowed
the distance the two ends of the line
snaked cautiously ahead bent on encir-
cling him

  with a hopeless groan joe witek
jabbed the button controling the noise-
less motor instantly the boat slowed
braking quickly to a halt by the time
he was able to drop to the ground a ring
of enemy ships were about him

  a tall swarthy man in the gleaming
gray tunic of a senodab stepped out
and approached joe who remained
seated behind the wheel

  get out the man ordered laconical-
ly his face betraying no particular emo-
tion

  the detective did not move now
dont get excited bud he said placat-

ingly im sorry about borrowing your
car without asking but you see i was in
a hurry

  the man eyed him steadily get
down he repeated and when joe
showed no indication of obeying he
drew a strange appearing instrument
from his belt and pointed it threaten-
ingly at the other

  to joe it looked something like an
oversize water pistol the muzzle was
no larger than a tiny nail hole and
then he recalled the thin streak of fire
that had narrowly missed him the night
before

  he said you dont have to get so
damn huffy about it and slid from be-
hind the wheel the man took him by
one arm and urged him not ungently
toward his own ship

  aboard his captor touched the siren
control giving three short bursts of
sound instantly every craft swung into
position the pattern a straight line
pointing toward the east another siren
note and the procession was in motion
like a flight of low flying planes

  joe tugged at the sleeve of the man
with the gun

  where we going bud

  the other swung strangely luminous
eyes toward him i am kram not
bud he said tonelessly and you are
being taken to the master

  whos he

  senoj is master

  joe beamed swell ive been try-
ing to find him ever since i came to
this asylum

the mans glowing eyes were puz-
zled this is not asylum this is-
dont tell me interrupted joe
im in esreveria i still think its a
loony-bin 

  kram shrugged as you wish he
said indifferently

  what kind of a guy is this senoj
joe persisted


fantastic adventures

  you will see

  no i mean it joe said do you
think hell help me get back to center
city

  kram frowned there is no such
place he said flatly

  the detective made a face youre
a big help he snarled

  the other made no reply and joe
lapsed into silence

an hour later a long range of high
hills came into view dead ahead so
swiftly were the ships moving that the
elevation seemed to leap toward them

  the line of boats rose steeply soon
the crest was reached and passed joe
witek gave a sharp gasp of pure sur-
prise

  a wide valley lay beneath them here
was a great city of mighty stone build-
ings in some instances towering a hun-
dred feet in the air a tremendous wall
sat box-like around the outskirts

  rorret explained kram briefly

  this is where senoj hangs out joe
asked

  senoj is master here

  joe nodded satisfied thats what
i mean

  the line of ships passed slowly
through massive gates set in the thick
walls within broad streets were much
in evidence people both men and
women thronged the sidewalks while
smaller ships moved slowly above the
pavemented avenues

  the twenty ships came to a halt be-
fore a huge hangar covering easily the
equivalent of a city block joe between
kram and another of the gray-clad men
entered a small flier and set off deeper
into the city

  joe interested in spite of the uncer-
tainty of his position here looked about
with the greatest interest after a few
blocks his attention suddenly focused
on a comparatively low building before

the wide entrance of which a fleet of
small fliers were being emptied of small
glass-like crates

  joes eyes threatened to pop from his
head when he saw what it was those
crates contained he made a startled
grab at krams arm

  for the love of mike he ex-
claimed am i seeing things or do
those cases have babies in them
kram stared at him in amazement
i see no babies he said there are
no new-born where you are looking
it was joes turn to show astonish-
ment you dont he asked then
what would you call those in the little
glass crates

  krams face cleared oh i did not
understand you why those are peo-
ple of esreveria who have grown aged
in service to the master since they
have reached their dotage and are only
a few hours from death we bring them
here until they disappear

   disappear joe echoed

  yes they are placed in great vats
left there three days when the vats
are unsealed the bodies have entirely
disappeared where only the master
knows

  joes face wrinkled into a distastful
expression forget that i asked he
said now i know this is a special
kind of nut-house

  after a few more blocks had been
traveled the craft stopped before a
mammoth building of white stone tow-
ering many stories into the air enter-
ing the two guards led joe into a room
off the central hall its only furnishing a
small square table with a line of buttons
set into its surface the room itself
was ceilingless far above joe could see
a faint glow where sunlight entered
through a skylight

  kram touched one of the buttons
and without the slightest sound the floor
under their feet began to rise carrying
they gave him a rope



them rapidly roofward every ten feet
or so closed doors appeared in the sides
of the shaft

  at the fifteenth level the floor
stopped its upward motion and stood
still the three men left the room-
like elevator and the young detective
was led down a long corridor and into
a great chamber

  joe who had been building fantastic
pictures of what he would find in senojs
stronghold was completely unprepared
for what met his eyes

tt was as though he had stepped into
the general offices of some central
city corporation neat rows of desks
filled most of the floor space behind
many of which girls were seated at
typewriters busily engaged in turning
out correspondence here and there
about the room men sat behind larger
desks bent over papers or dictating to
secretaries who with shorthand books
poised on crossed knees took down the
words

  a girl at a switchboard near the door
looked up brightly as they entered

  yes she cooed

  we wish to see the master kram
said

  the girl took up one of the cords
whom shall i say is calling

  kram and samoht with a new-
born

  one moment please

  she inserted the plug twiddled a key
and said a few rapid words into the
mouthpiece then she nodded cheer-
fully said thank you sir and with-
drew the cord

  you may go right back she told
them

  the three men followed a railinged
passageway to the rear of the room
kram paused in front of a paneled door
knocked discreetly then turned the
knob

chapter iv

rjphe room was furnished as a mod-
ern business office behind a large
glass-topped desk in front of the ceil-
ing-high windows sat a tall thin man
with bristling black hair and small deep-
set glowing black eyes separated by a
prominent nose there was a chill ici-
ness about his expression that was re-
pellant

  kram and samoht with joe witek
between them approached the desk and
bowed their heads humbly

  the seated man said state your rea-
son for seeking this interview his
words were spoken with a cold frugality
that was impressive

  kram said o master we bring for
judgment a new-born who has proved
troublesome

  the small luminous eyes went into
joe like a dissecting tool

state the nature of the trouble

  kram spent several moments giving
in minute detail a full account of joes
behavior in injuring one collector steal-
ing a small kavar and making neces-
sary the use of twenty large kavars to
intercept and capture him

  when the recital of sins was ended
senoj regarded the silent detective with
a sort of cold respect

  who buried your coffin he
snapped

  joes bewilderment was plain what
coffin

  senojs narrow lips tightened with
exasperation judgment delayed by
idiotic questions will only add to the
severity of your punishment

  joe sighed look mr senoj theres
a hell of a lot of things i dont under-
stand all i know is that i represent
dreyfuss  sons and i came here to
collect the five thousand dollars you owe
them otherwise i want that rope you
swiped from the houseware section


fantastic adventures

  senojs dark face was suddenly sev-
eral shades lighter and his mouth twist-
ed into an o of shocked incredulity

  both kram and samoht were staring
at the master with wondering eyes
kram said the new-born speaks gib-
berish master

  senoj seemed not to have heard the
remark slowly his lips returned to a
hard line and then he spoke the words
little more than a whisper

  how did you cross the gap

  joe understood the question perfectly
with a part of the first rope he re-
plied not all of it burned

  there was hatred in the black eyes
across from him hatred and a glint of
fear and then a grayish film seemed
to mask the luminous quality of the eyes
as senoj turned to kram and samoht

  return to your duties he com-
manded shortly

  the faces of the two went blank with
surprise the new-born- kram be-
gan uncertainly

  he remains here senoj snapped
i will deal with him personally
but-

  do you question my orders senoj
asked silkily

  kram swallowed no master we
hasten to obey

tturriedly the two rorretians
backed to the door bowed deeply
and withdrew only when the door had
closed after them did senoj turn back
to joe witek

  i want you to tell me he said
bluntly exactly how you managed to
follow me to esreveria

  joe explained briefly what had oc-
curred after senojs mysterious disap-
pearance he concluded by saying so
if youll pay for that rope ill be getting
along back to center city

 how

  why ill- hunh

  youre a fool

  now wait a min-

  i said youre a fool senoj snarled
you are in esreveria do you know
where that is

  joe shook his head no he ad-
mitted but then there are a lot of
counties in this state i never heard of
senojs thin lips twisted into a sneer
simpleton this is the fourth dimen-
sion

  the what

  the rope that brought you here
senoj went on calmly is the only
means of passing between the two
worlds long ago i learned the secret
and through it i have become master
here i alone knew the method until
you stumbled across it

  joe witeks head was spinning he
reached out weakly to steady himself
against the desk

  what he asked faintly do i do
now

  senoj was suddenly business-like
he leaned forward and touched a but-
ton on the surface of his desk a mo-
ment later the single door swung brisk-
ly inward and a young dark-haired
woman note-book in hand came quick-
ly across the floor to the desk

  witek said the master give
this young woman the names of those
who directed you to rorret

  joe eyed him suspiciously whats
the idea he demanded you figur-
ing on punishing them for helping me
senoj looked pained of course not
had they not sent you here others
might have learned of my secret i
intend to reward them for their loy-
alty

  the explanation seemed logical joe
admitted to himself he repeated the
names and watched the girl jot them
into her book when she had finished
senoj said that will be all enela
type up the list and turn it over to
they gave him a rope



kram for action

  the girl said yes sir and whisked
out of the office

  joe still standing in front of the
desk shifted uneasily he said if
that takes care of everything mr
senoj id like the money you owe
dreyfuss  sons and the means of get-
ting back to center city

  senoj who now seemed in excellent
spirits nodded

  of course he said im sure that
can be arranged youll have quite a
story to tell those back in your di-
mension i warn you though none will
believe you

  joe grinned if i only tell em
what i know theyre going to ask a
flock of questions i wont have answers
for like how babies can talk and
why they called me new-born here
and how dead men can rise from their
graves those kinds of things

  it will do no harm to supply those
answers now senoj admitted half to
himself

gomething about the faint stress
placed on that last word brought a
lifting sensation along the young mans
scalp

  in esreveria the master con-
tinued the processes of birth growth
and death are completely reversed to
that of your own world here we
are born in that state of development
in which people die in your dimension
a new-born man or woman is not ad-
judged ready to seek a mate until he or
she has buried an empty coffin some-
day from that coffin a new-born will
arise and seek out the one who interred
its bithplace with its parents it will
learn to speak and eat and fend for
itself when the time comes it too
will bury a coffin then seek out a mate

  as the years pass these new-born
grow older but instead of doing so in

the sense you know they become more
youthful with advancing age returning
finally to infanthood when at last
they disappear we know that death has
taken them

  most new-born belong to the tillers
of the fields those who show the
highest intelligence however are
selected to dwell in rorret where they
are taught the duties of collectors and
clerks and soldiers

  joe took a deep breath if i hadnt
seen it myself i wouldnt believe it
and now i see why telling such a yarn
back in center city would get me put
where they keep all the napoleons
and then his brows came together
in a frown how come he asked
that youve lived so long why dont
you shrink down to kid size

  senojs smile was faintly contemptu-
ous elementary he replied six
months of each year i dwell in your
dimension during which time i age that
much in the earth sense of the word
then i return here for a like period
which in your eyes would cause me
to grow younger again thus i have
maintained the same age for three mil-
lenia 

  joe nodded nothing surprised him
any longer strange he mused
that the people of the two dimensions
are alike youd kinda think that
theyd be a lot different

  that senoj said smiling is the
most remarkable thing of all for
when death occurs in your world re-
birth takes place here and when an
infant here passes on it comes to
earth as a new-born babel

  god amighty breathed joe rev-
erently

  senoj rose from his chair now and
sauntered to the door

  i suppose he said mildly that
you are anxious to return to your own
world


fantastic adventures

  thats right joe admitted ive
got to get back before dreyfuss  sons
fire me which brings up a point
how about the five thousand you owe
them

  ah yes senoj was opening a
wall cupboard next to the door reach-
ing in he brought out a small metal
object then turned to face joe

  the younger man stiffened with
alarm for senoj was holding a du-
plicate of the fire-gun which kram
had displayed earlier that day

  hey he said nervously whats
the idea

  the master lazily lifted the muzzle
of the weapon until it pointed square-
ly at joes chest

  it is time for you to leave us my
young friend he said softly there
are two methods to choose from one
the rope which i keep here in this
cupboard the other is of course this
gun

  joe fear flooding his mind took a
step backward the edge of the desk
preventing further retreat uncon-
sciously he lifted his hands above his
shoulders and as he did so he was
suddenly aware of a dragging weight
beneath his left armpit

jljis gun he had neglected to leave
it at shannons office and until
this moment had completely forgotten
it he silently cursed himself for not
having remembered before senoj had
gained the drop on him

  why do you have to kill me he
asked unsteadily

  i cant chance letting you go back
with the knowledge youve acquired
here the other explained while
it is doubtful that anyone would pay
much attention to your story some
earth scientist might decide to inves-
tigate should they hit on my secret
it possibly would prove fatal to my

plans of conquest

   conquest joe repeated

  the master leaned negligently
against the door but the gun in his
hand dd not waver

  yes he said my experiments
have progressed to where i shall be able
to move troops and many kavars into
your dimension with the weapons we
are now constructing we shall have
little difficulty with earth govern-
ments

  your histories record that many
men have aspired to rule your world
i shall be the first to rule two worlds

  joes mind raced with whirlwind
speed he knew that the slightest move
on his part toward the gun under his
arm would bring a ray of fire into his
body

  and then his one chance born of
desperation flashed into his mind

  but if i promise to say nothing of
what i have learned he said stalling
for time as he spoke his left hand
resting on the desk and slightly behind
him slid slowly backward along the
glass surface

  senoj shook his head i cannot af-
ford to take the risk

  he steadied the fire gun until it
pointed squarely at joes heart joes
fingers closed on the object of his
search gradually senoj was increas-
ing the pressure on the trigger

  it was then that the door against
which the master was leaning was
thrust suddenly inward throwing him
momentarily off balance instantly
joes hand darted beneath his coat and
came out again the gun it carried spit-
ting bullets

  mingled with the sound of exploding
cartridges was the scream of senojs
secretary drawn to the scene when joe
had pressed the button on the desk

  in a fog of gunsmoke joe saw the
master of esreveria topple forward
they gave him a rope



red seeping from a hole in his forehead
from beyond the closed door slammed
shut when the girl had retreated hur-
riedly the young detective hould hear
the sounds of running feet

  with two giant strides joe witek
reached the door he could find no
evidence of a lock frantically his
eyes sought an object large enough
to bar entry until he could complete
his escape

  a heavy couch stood along one wall
exerting strength he had never realized
he possessed he dragged the cumber-
some bit of furniture in front of the
door just as someones weight crashed
against the panels

  with savage haste joe dug into the
contents of the cupboard seeking the
rope senoj had said was there al-
ready the couch was beginning to give
under the pressure from the other room

  and then joes fingers found a thin
coil eagerly he tore it from the
drawer finding it to be a slender rope
of many colors woven into an intricate
design

  now im getting somewhere he
gloated

  mufflled shouts reached his ears from
beyond the quivering planks of the
door lifting his gun joe pointed it
at the spot where a crack was slowly
widening under the assault of heavy
bodies and pressed the trigger there
followed a futile click the chambers
had been emptied at senoj

jphe rope gripped tightly in one
hand joe vaulted the desk and
crouched from sight bringing the
strands close to his eyes he peered with
great concentration at the involved pat-
tern following the twisting lines of
color as he had done the day before in
the central hotel basement

  a familiar lassitude began to steal
into his mind dimly he heard a re-

sounding crash as the heavy couch
toppled over the hemp in his hands
began slowly to expand    larger   
larger   

  he felt a sudden sharp pain along
one side of his head a whirlpool of
midnight velvet washed across his mind
and he was toppling forward as from a
great height   

  a voice said hey joe whered
you find that

  joe witek opened his eyes he was
standing in a stiff strained attitude the
rope still clutched firmly in his hands

  he shuddered violently and drew
back his right arm  

   what the hells the matter with you
fella

   joes hand fell limply to his side
evans the hotel detective was leaning
against the boiler-room sink staring at
him with puzzled eyes

   joe took a deep breath of the damp
basement air wow he gasped exu-
berantly theres not a thing wrong
with me not a thing i feel wonder-
ful

  evans stared at him critically
maybe so but you dont look so hot
howd you get that cut on your head

   with the others words came realiza-
tion to joe of a stinging sensation just
above his left ear he lifted cautious
fingers to the spot and drew them away
stained with blood one of senojs
men had winged him after all

  it doesnt amount to anything
he said grinning wryly guess i
bumped myself on the faucet i was
washing the smoke off this piece of
rope and i bent over too quick

   he stole a sidelong glance at the rope
in his hands then glanced hastily away
with purposeful steps he walked to-
warctrhe huge furnace in the far corner
of the room

   evans followed him plainly mysti-
fied he watched joe swing back the


fantastic adventures

heavy iron door revealing the roaring
flames within

 what are you going to do he
asked

  i said joe grimly am going to
burn a rope

 evans jumped forward and caught
his arm now wait a minute where
the hell do you think youre at that
looks like a good piece of rope you
cant come around here destroying
hotel property

 joe jerked his arm away this

given since they differ with the various comp-
anies and with different grades of gasoline it
is up to the companies to portion out their
allowances of tetraethyl as they think best no
official tests have been made by the government
as yet

  little or no tetraethyl is used in third and
lower grades of gasoline so they are not affected

  according to the companies the new gasoline
gives just as good mileage as the old and the
engines start just as easily there is a little
more tendency to knock in pulling a heavy grade
and the acceleration is a little less rapid but
otherwise it is hard to detect the difference in
the new gasoline

atost public speakers are forced to use notes
of some kind in their speeches but most
audiences prefer a speaker who gives his talk
without them since reference to notes tends to
lessen the spontaneity of the speech

  to satisfy both parties a dr forset has in-
vented a device which he named the rostra
forneta the manuscript or notes are prepared
in mirror writing which means that they can be
read from right to left in a mirror but would
be backwards if viewed without the mirror the
manuscript is placed on one cylinder and then
wound onto another cylinder by the speaker as
he desires in front of a mirror hidden from the
audience

  light is provided by a lamp on the speakers
stand and the mirror used is usually a magnify-
ing type so that the writing may be made much
smaller on the cylinder than the size reproduced
for the speaker to see when the speaker looks
into the mirror for his notes the audience thinks

rope doesnt belong to the hotel bud
it belonged to a guy named senoj and
it aint a good rope its a bad one a
damn bad one

  with a savage motion he flung the
length of hemp into the fiery maw of
the furnace then slammed the door

  but my gosh evans protested
what if he comes back and asks for
it

  joe gave a short harsh laugh dont
worry pal senoj wont be back no
sir he wont be back-not ever

he is looking at them and that his entire speech
is extemporaneous or at least so well prepared
that he does not have to be flustered with sheets
getting out of order or losing notes

  all the speaker has to remember is to keep
turning the cylinder this arrangement gives
the audience more enjoyment and the speaker
more ease and confidence

  your editor has been receiving many letters
from you readers commenting on the short fillers
and one-page articles we have been running re-
cently and asking us by all means to continue
this policy you will notice that this issue con-
tains a good number of these fillers we will
certainly continue them

  miles shelton has written a fine novel for us
called craigs book the whole story was
inspired by a very decorative illustration by
magarian it starts out five pretty girls on
one float its a story youll really enjoy and
its coming to you soon

  e k jarvis has done a strange sort of story
around another illustration by magarian called
the curse of many hands this also will
be coming your way soon wed advise you to
watch for it

ttow old were you when you were born

    there seems to be a difference in opinion
between western and oriental peoples on this
topic we westerns consider the baby zero
years old at birth among orientals the 
days of pre-natal development are not so freely
discounted the chinese child has his first birth-
day immediately after delivery so that he is
already considered a year old when born

the willies a yarn which falls into the unique
classification

a lthough most fishes breathe by means of
gills there are still a few relic forms which
have lungs and actually use them these forms
commonly called lungfish are found in africa
and south america they possess no gills and
live in muddy marshes they are never found in
streams or large bodies of water alive because of
the fact that they have no means of extracting
air from the water in the places in which they
live they must pull themselves above the level
of the mud and are usually found lying inertly
against the side of a mudhole if they slip into
the mud too far they die for a long time it
was thought that these fishes were a missing link
of some sort but those scientists who never could
see what such a weak fish could beget have now
shown that the lungfish is merely an evolutionary
offshoot

xe are all well acquainted with the fact that

  we get our sugar today either from the sugar
cane or from beets but now we find that an-
other source that has been completely overlooked
all these years is the parsnip parsnips have an
average sugar content of about  and beets are
only rated at  in addition to having a high
sugar content parsnips are a rich source of iron
proteins calcium phosphorus and vitamin bi
this new source may go a long way to replace
the sugar we formerly imported in such large
quantities

xto longer is it necessary for mechanics to swear
 a blue streak as they painfully try to remove
the grease and grime that has accumulated on
their hands during the day for a new cream
has been developed called mitts which can be
spread on the workmens hands just like cold
cream and it will protect them from ink grease
or paint after the days work is over all you
have to do is wash your hands with ordinary
soap and water and off comes the mitts together
with the grease

  as if this action were not enough the manu-
facturers claim that one of the creams ingredi-
ents has a slight medicinal quality so that it helps
to heal many of the cuts on the workers hands
at the same time it serves as a dirt protector

rerhaps mr lebbens c kemp felt sorry for

	the poor motorists on the east coast who are
having their gas rations decreased but were sure
he will receive thanks from the entire country
including the war department for his discovery
of how to produce anti-knock gasoline from car-
bon monoxide and hydrogen his discovery is
covered by patent number  and has been
assigned to the texas qompany of new york

  both carbon monoxide and hydrogen are gases
that are obtainable in huge quantities and by

bringing them together when the proper catalyst
no mr hitler we wont name the catalyst s
present results in the production of butanes and
butylenes the next step involves the conversion
of the butane into isobutane by isomerization
and this is made to react with the butylene by
means of another catalyst to produce some liquid
hydrocarbons that possess a high anti-knock rating
and vaporizes just like gasoline

ne of the most dangerous of all substances
to work with is radium or a radio-active
material and so science has devised an instru-
ment to protect the lives of workers who must
work with these materials it was developed by
the geophysical instrument company and it op-
erates so that a warning signal is sounded at the
same time that a red light flashes to tell the
worker that there is too much radium or radio-
active materials in the near vicinity

  having been properly warned the dangerous
materials can be removed before any harm is
done when the danger is past the alarm is
turned off and again stands ready to give its
warning in addition to standing guard the de-
vice is very useful in checking the strength of
the radium compounds worked on so that any
loss of the material can be detected at once this
is very vital since radium is so very expensive
and rare that the loss of even a minute amount
can involve thousands of dollars

with these observations we come to the end
of the editors notebook for this month
well be back again next month with more of the
same and with a flock of new stories even better
than the top-notchers youll find in this issue
we havent given you any hint of whats in this
issue but we feel that this time youll write and
tell us what a swell issue it isl and you can
thank our secretary for it-she did all the work

fantastic adventures

hed been awaiting so patiently

  that will be yokomura no doubt
small thought coolly

  he smiled sardonically and flipped
his cigarette over the wharf edge with
thumb and forefinger it described a
flaming arc in the blackness disap-
peared over the pilings then zzzzisssed
out in the softly lapping waters of the
harbor

  the footsteps on the wharf halted
abruptly a voice hissed forth carry-
ing to the colonels ears

  is that you krauss

  colonel small didnt move he
smiled as he hissed a reply

  ja yokomura mien herr said the
colonel it isss me krauss

  there was an audible sigh of relief
from the japanese spy then the foot-
steps started toward small again

  colonel small stepped back ever so
slightly into the even deeper darkness
of the warehouse door he almost
touched the dead body of the nazi
blackguard krauss whom hed slain
less than ten minutes before

  the colonels hand tightened on the
butt of the service automatic in his
pocket his lips went flat in a merci-
less smile and with his free hand he
pulled his dark civilian fedora a little
lower over his eyes

  the jap spy yokomura was only a
few feet away now ten eight six
four feet

  krauss i have the plans for-
yokomura began now standing before
colonel small

  the jap agents hiss of shocked
surprise was followed by colonel
smalls calmly contemptuous voice

  draw you little yellowed weasel
the colonel said

  the japs face was twisted with fear
and treachery

  small he gasped the ace of
u s g-

  did you expect asked colonel
small in a cold mirthless chuckle to
see santa claus

  and then the jap spys hand flew
swiftly to his pocket and with the speed
of a striking snake the enemy agent
held a gun trained on colonel smalls
forehead

  raise your hands colonel small
you american dog yokomura hissed

  small smiled i should judge now
he said evenly that you have every
advantage

  the colonels lightning-like draw of
the service automatic in his trenchcoat
pocket was swifter more miraculous
than the speed of a fast shot camera

  he fired three times and the jap spy
slid forward on the wharf planking be-
fore the colonels feet yokomuras
head what was left of it clearly re-
vealed that all three shots had buried
themselves one on the other in the
center of the orientals skull

  colonel small looked down at the
slain enemy agent his mouth was
twisted sardonically mirthlessly again
he turned and looked back at the dead
nazi agent lying behind him

  you were a little more trouble he
acknowledged touching the chest
wound the nazi had inflicted on him
before being killed

jgack at the office of g- some thirty
minutes later colonel smalls en-
trance created a sensation smilingly
he passed through the outer bull pens
and into the sanctum of the general

  five men were clustered around the
generals desk they were shirtsleeved
haggard obviously worried their at-
tention at the moment of colonel
smalls entrance was centered on a dis-
orderly melee of papers lying on the
desk

  the general looked up

  colonel he gasped you you-
the other abner small



i turned over the bodies to the
fbi sir i think that cleans out
their nest

 every eye in the room was on small
 now and every eye was filled with in-
 credulous awe ungrudging admiration

whats up small asked nodding
at the papers

 the worry came back to all faces
 the general answered

 the intercepted code message colo-
 nel he said weve been trying to
 break it for twenty-four hours straight
 damn it sir but im afraid were
 licked

 casually colonel small stepped to
 the desk reached for the intercepted
 message he looked at it a moment
 frowning

mind my having a go at it gen-
eral small asked

 but good lord colonel our best men
 in the deciphering department the
 greatest brains in- the general began

 but small was speaking already

the sentheby breakdown formula
combined with the idion-greeby fre-
quency count reduction should do it
he said confidently

 the head of the deciphering depart-
 ment looked at him in shocked wonder

 by god colonel you hit on it why
 didnt we think of that

 colonel small tossed the paper care-
 lessly back on the desk he smiled sym-
 pathetically at the overworked deci-
 phering head

 thats all right old man you cant
 be expected to think of everything

 it was then that the general rose from
 behind his desk staring wide-eyed at
 the crimson splotch on the chest of the
 colonels trenchcoat

 good god man the general cried
 youve been wounded

 colonel small smiled sardonically

 have i general he said

 weak from loss of blood colonel ab-

ner small caught at the desk then
started to slump to the floor   

jyrr small mr small

         little abner small looked up
startledly at the sound of the voice
shaken from his daydream

  it was the sergeant behind the desk
and he beckoned with a pencil a tall
erect young second lieutenant stood be-
hind the seated sergeant

  abner small rose quickly from his
seat along the wooden bench

he walked over to the reception desk

the sergeant smiled amiably the
lieutenant will talk to you he said

  the young second lieutenant moved
over a little to one side beckoning ab-
ner to follow him in a corner they
paused

  i i didnt hear the sergeant ab-
ner small began apologetically i i-
he was about to say that he had been
wool-gathering then he suddenly real-
ized what a terrible impression such a
confession would make on the lieuten-
ant after all prospective g- appli-
cants didnt wool-gather or shouldnt

  i i didnt hear the sergeant little
abner small repeated foolishly

  thats quite all right mr small
said the tall young second lieutenant
he had an amazingly friendly smile and
for an instant it warmed the hopes that
beat so frantically in the small chest of
abner small

  i want to thank you for the war
department mr small the second
lieutenant said we appreciate your
patriotism in offering your ah services
to military intelligence especially in
view of the fact that you are beyond
military age however we havent any
need at present for the background you
offer but please rest assured that well
keep your name on file and should we

fantastic adventures

lieutenants voice was lost in a drone to
little abner small a sick aching dis-
appointment had closed its fist tightly
around his heart and was squeezing for
all it was worth the squeezing was
bringing a dampness to mr smalls
eyes and he didnt want to remove his
horn-rimmed glasses and dry them
there in front of the young lieutenant

  dejectedly little mr small muttered
something about thanks and turned
quickly away from the railing

  once outside the doors of the mili-
tary intelligence office mr small
peered beatenly around until he located
the darkened corner in which hed hid-
den his rubbers before entering the
sacred precincts

  he found them put them on picked
up his umbrella from the other corner
in which hed left it and turned down
the corridor to the elevators anyway
they hadnt sniggered at the rubbers
and umbrella the way that young snipe
at the fbi place the week before

  but that was small consolation to the
sensitive soul of little abner j small
nor could he find anthing pleasurable
in the realization that this was perhaps
the fifteenth time he had been turned
away from innumerable such offices

  he had been to his draft board eight
times until they had finally forbade him
to return unless to quote the chairman
this country is invaded

  an invasion mr small shuddered
at the thought that the war would ever
go so badly as that for his beloved na-
tion the elevator stopped and mr
small got on still if there were an in-
vasion   

rjphe newspapers those printed on
the u s side of the lines this side
of the rockies were full of the hor-
rible news wave upon wave of enemy
ships and planes had made beachheads
and from those beachheads enemy

tanks and troops had crashed relentless-
ly past the crumbling but gallant walls
that had been our first defense lines

  the names of the cities swept by the
ravening hordes of the axis were ghast-
ly and familiar to even the youngest
school children fighting cursing dy-
ing grim-jawed u s troops were find-
ing their numbers too small to stay the
tidal wave of the crushing enemy inva-
sion

  the situation was bad-and growing
steadily worse

  its mad sir i know its mad the
staff general said to the commander in
chief but can we lose anything by
it after all he has a long record of
citations for bravery and tactical bril-
liance under fire hed be far more
than a lowly private now if he hadnt
refused time after time the promotions
offered him

  the commander in chief nodded
gravely albeit wearily he sighed

  you say the entire general tactical
staff is behind the plans submitted by
him the commander in chief asked
slowly

  to the last man sir said the staff
general and to the point where we
are determined to force him to take
complete charge of his plans as gen-
eral

  then send him in said the com-
mander in chief

  the door opened then and private
abner small of the united states army
marched crisply into the room clicked
his heels and saluted the commander in
chief and staff general

  private small reporting sirs he
said quietly

  at ease private small said the
commander in chief have a ciga-
rette he extended a box of expensive
cigarettes to the begrimed ragged hel-
meted figure

  thanks sir private small de-
the other abner small



murred i roll my own

  the staff general and commander in
chief watched while private small drew
forth a pouch of bull durham and a
cigarette paper marveled at the swift
dexterity with which he rolled a cigar-
ette

  after an instant when the staff gen-
eral had lighted private smalls cigar-
ette the commander in chief spoke

ive heard much of your heroism un-
der fire private small he said and
of your modesty in refusing promotion
have you sir private small asked
noncommittally

  and now these plans of yours pri-
vate small said the commander in
chief have been called to my atten-
tion and to the attention of the gen-
eral tactical staff they think they are
brilliantly conceived

  they are direct said private small
modestly

  what is your opinion of the entire
situation private small the comman-
der in chief asked leaning forward do
you think we can fight on much
longer

  private small took a slow thought-
ful draught from his cigarette he
smiled sardonically expelling the smoke
as his words rang out crisply

  if my plans are put into effect sir
he said i will guarantee that we will
have trapped and completely annihi-
lated the enemy forces to a man within
two weeks in three weeks sir we will
have their unconditional surrender
both the staff general and the com-
mander in chief gasped eyes wide

  but private small the staff gen-
eral said even with such a brilliant
maneuver as you have outlined-
private small cut him off quietly
you know my record sir

  the staff general nodded of course
everyone in amer-

  private small cut him off again

  have i ever let the united states
of american down

  it was the commander in chief who
sprang up fire and admiration in his
eyes jaw hard

  by god private small the com-
mander in chief said fiercely i believe
in you sir to the hilt your plans will
be carried out-with you in the sad-
dle 

jittle abner small was jarred
from his reverie by the sharp voice
of the uniformed female elevator op-
erator

  thirty-second floor she snapped
this is the top we dont go any
higher do you want to get off or
dont you

  mr small looked up like a fright-
ened gazelle saw that the elevator was
deserted and that the operator was
glaring at him

  mr small flushed miserably from the
brim of his old-fashioned derby to the
edge of his celluloid collar

  i ah im sorry i guess i must
have gotten on the wrong elevator i
wanted to go down not up

  why didnt you notice the light
above the door on the floor i picked you
up from the operator demanded it
would have told you that this elevator
was going up

  i ah i guess i didnt notice said
mr small im very sorry he
started to step out of the elevator

  might as well stay on snapped the
operator this will be the first ele-
vator down

  abner small stepped miserably back
into the elevator realizing redly that
but moments before hed been private
abner small u s a whose keen
analysis of every tactical situation was
about to save the world

  when mr small emerged into the
crowded downtown streets some three


fantastic adventures

minutes later he saw by the clock on
the board of trade building that it was
getting very close to six oclock

  allowing himself the necessary forty
minutes it would take to get home he
realized that he would again be more
than half an hour late to dinner and
that again his spouse velma would be
angered to the point of homicide

  abner small shuddered at this
thought and his weary little shoulders
slumped even more there would be
no explaining to velma the cause for his
tardy arrival there never was and
if she knew that hed left his office-
where hed worked as bookkeeper for a
nickel-squeezing firm of lawyers more
than twenty years-half an hour early
in order to be certain of an interview
with military intelligence officers she
would berate him even more thor-
oughly

  somehow velma had learned of her
husbands attempts to enlist at his draft
board-and the explosive verbal thun-
der that smote abners eardrums ever
since was endless and agonizing to the
little man

  and now if she suspected that he was
still trying-

  abner small let the thought dangle
and squirmed more deeply into the
crowds along the sidewalk as if seek-
ing physically to lose the mental wraith
of his wifes anger behind him

telma plump wrathful and slop-
py met little abner small at the
door of their humble dwelling one hour
later somewhere along the route ab-
ner had daydreamed again and gone six
blocks past his stop-hence the twenty
minutes beyond his original calcula-
tions

  she stood there with her hands on her
large unvenus-like hips her round un-
kempt bleached head cocked belliger-
ently to one side while her angry eyes

sparked forth the state of her mind

  hello velma abner said uncom-
fortably

  velraa watched him as he kicked off
his rubbers and placed them beside the
umbrella rack in the hallway she
opened up as he was slipping out of his
coat

  you bum she shrilled you un-
grateful shiftless loafing bum

  inwardly abner small sighed out-
wardly he betrayed no expression he
started into the living room his wife
at his heels

  i slave all day over a good dinner
and you come home here almost an hour
late velma declared in the strident
tone of one talking long distance with-
out the aid of a telephone

  what inquired abner mildly and
automatically do we have to eat to-
night

  it was significant that abner never
voiced this query with any trace of
hopefulness in his tone

  potato salad velma snorted indig-
nantly and nice cold meats

  abner was aware that velma had
again been to the delicatessen for their
evening fare but he didnt comment on
this fact on the table next to the sofa
was a large box of gooey chocolates or
what had been a large box of the same
a glance showed abner that his wife
had made an overwhelming frontal as-
sault on the box and consumed its con-
tents almost entirely

  thrown carelessly back up on the
floor next to the couch abner saw the
heliothrope cover of a love novel luridly
titled play girl of passion

  well velmas voice came harshly
to his ears whatre yuh staring at

  nothing abner answered feeling
utterly truthful in his reply abso-
lutely nothing at all

  he sighed and sat wearily down on
the couch
the other abner small



  well velma barked are you
gonna get yourself a nap or are you
gonna get out an eat your dinner before
it gets cold

  abner rose have you eaten he
asked

  velma nodded emphatically you
bet your life i have im not gonna
starve myself because my bum of a
husband suits himself about the time
he comes home

  feeling grateful for this small break
abner went out to the kitchen where
on a table covered by last weeks news-
papers velma had set out his repast on
plates that were scarcely clean

  velma didnt follow abner into the
kitchen she remained in the living
room a fact attested to by the sudden
deafening blare of the radio announc-
ing the presentation of the hundred-
and-eighth in a series of slushy pro-
grams entitled dear reginald how
 love you

  velma never missed dear reginald
hoiv i love you it came over the
airwaves at this time three sessions
weekly for one-half hour per session
it was velmas favorite program inas-
much as it stank far more putridly than
innumerable similar programs aired
daily through the kindness of soup and
laxative peddlers

  abner sat picking at his cold potato
salad thinking to himself that there
was certainly reason behind the radio
trade expression of airing a show
most of them needed airing very badly

  after a few desultory swallows of the
cold canned mess of soup at his elbow
abner put his spoon quietly on the table
and began his nightly contemplation of
fate versus abner small

  he began as he always did in such
remorseful relivings with his marriage
to velma everything paradoxically
enough seemed to start and end with
that event

  how many years ago had that been
abner found it hard to remember ex-
actly too long anyway

  abner tried to remember what sort
of a person hed been back then it was
hard very hard to draw any accurate
picture of what he was once like hed
been a little gray mouse far too long
now to enable him to associate any other
type of character with himself abner
had no delusions about himself as he
now was no delusions save those ut-
terly glorious daydreamings in which he
escaped completely from reality with-
out those daydreams abner knew life
wouldnt hold anything worth having

  when had he first started those
blessed escapes through daydreaming
abner tried to think back hed enter-
tained daydreams of course for as long
as he could remember

  very man every human being ab-
ner realized had daydreams of
some sort it was part of the stuff of
human nature but yet his own day-
dreams were far more sharp far closer
to an actual escape from a sordid real-
ity to a glamorous never land than the
average of this abner felt certain

  but that he reasoned bitterly was
merely because he had far more reason
to need complete escape than the aver-
age man sickly enough abner was
aware that his present life was consid-
erably less than that of the average
person and even more sickly abner
knew that it was scarcely anything less
than his own fault

  somewhere back along the drab
scratch in the dust of humanity repre-
senting the line of his life abner small
had sold his birthright when it had
happened or how it had come about
abner wasnt quite aware but it had
happened there was no doubt of it
and from that mark in his life he had
started the all-too-easy slide that had


fantastic adventures

ended with his present status

  velma abner realized was not en-
tirely to blame velma was but a con-
tributing factor had he had guts and
intelligence and a sense of his own des-
tiny abner would have thrown velma
out of his life long ago she would have
been the same sort of wife for whatever
man she married abner knew but how
many men would have put up with a
velma past the point where her actual
character began to show not many
but abner had

  he had put up with velma just as he
had uncomplainingly put up with so
many things in the hope that they would
iron themselves out in time he had
put up with the unfeeling treatment and
slave wages of his employers in exactly
the same fashion hoping that time
would remedy wrongs and he had
mentally and physically become one of
lifes walking doormats a human floor
on whom people thought no more of
walking than they did on any floor

  emotionally however abner had
never completely died at least not
yet the emotional factors in any hu-
man being are harder to kill than his
mental or physical factors and so it
had been with abner his emotions
had stayed on after his mental and
physical self-respect walked out in dis-
gust at him

  which didnt make things any easier
for abner for with his emotions he
could still feel pain he could still rage
futilely at his lot and sense the state
into which he had fallen his instinct
and pure emotional balance made him
all too keenly aware that he was no
longer captain of his fate and master
of his soul

  and yet his emotions and instinct
for things lost permitted those won-
derful dreams and the dreams per-
mitted him a hope that was all too
agonizing because of their utter futility

  abner pushed aside his plate

  from the living room came the af-
fected accents of the heroine of velmas
favorite program

  richard deah deah richard said
the voice of the radio actress if one
must go forward as reginald has to do
ones best against the storm of this
great conflict i would rather that you
were a gallant birdman my love 

  the young radio actor who abner
felt sure was marcelled and perfumed
possessed a voice that was so utterly
affected it must have driven his con-
temporaries mad with envy

  i knew you would feel that way
madeline my sweet the young radio
actor lushed i must fly to battle-
even though it means-

  abner closed his eyes in sick disgust
blotting out the obnoxious voice if
that chap were ever to do any actual
flying abner felt certain it would be
out the nearest window and straight to
a beauty parlor

  abner put his head in his hands and
with his elbows on the table slumped
dejectedly beatenly forward his eyes
were closed already and now fatigue
and weary monotony lulled him into a
coma-like version of sleep  

tt seemed hours later-though it
was more a matter of minutes-
when some alien sensation snapped ab-
ner back into wakefulness quickly
bewilderedly he looked around

  he still sat before the kitchen table
but something else was changed he
looked up at the clock on the wall al-
most forty minutes had passed during
his nap and then he realized what
had seemed to be the alien circum-
stance the radio wasnt blatting
loudly forth as it inevitably was

  abner rose from the table pushing
the sleep from his eyes with his
knuckles
the other abner small



  curiously and not a little surprised
abner walked to the living room
velma wasnt there

  abner turned and walked back to the
bedroom thinking perhaps his spouse
was napping she wasnt there a
quick three minute search of the rest
of the house showed that velma wasnt
anywhere around the place

  maybe shes gone to a movie ab-
ner thought or over to a neighbors
for gossip

  he shrugged feeling a blessed sense
of relief velma did most of her run-
ning around to movies and to neigh-
bors and to bridge parties in the day-
time only infrequently did she ven-
ture forth at night and then never with-
out an announcement of her plans to
abner

  abner went back into the living room
and sat down in the comfortable depths
of the couch

  he reached into his pockets for one
of the five cigarettes his slender budget
permitted him to consume daily found
a match and lighted up with a luxuri-
ous sensation of enjoying forbidden
fruit ages ago velma had established
a set of house rules which included a
taboo against smoking anywhere on the
premises other than in the basement

  then abner picked up a wrinkled
page of the evening newspaper con-
taining the nights radio programs
scanning it quickly he saw that his
favorite commentator news analyst
and war correspondent was due on the
air in less than two minutes

  it had been fully three months since
the last occasion on which abner had
been permitted to hear that commenta-
tor three months ago when velma
had gone out to a bridge party had
been the last time hed tuned in on his
idol otherwise-when velma was at
home-the radio was tuned in only to
the stations of her selection

  eagerly abner snapped on the radio
flicked the dial around to the station he
wanted and set the volume to his lik-
ing then he sat back almost happily
taking a deep draught from his cigar-
ette and lifting his feet up to a com-
fortable position on the couch

  for a minute abner waited while a
dance band finished its quarter hour
broadcast from a remote suburban
night club of wide reputation then
the station identification came through
followed by the time and a spot com-
mercial inquiring gravely into the state
of the listeners liver

  abner listened impatiently to this
and then at last was rewarded by a
network announcers voice breaking in

  f b s is now pleased to present
george holden grentree ace war cor-
respondent author and military an-
alyst speaking to you over a shortwave
broadcast arranged especially by this
network-directly from london

  there was a brief spluttering of
static then the announcers voice say-
ing come in london

  abner small was thrilling to the mar-
row in his spine the very phrase was
enough to send icy tingles of vicariously
captured adventures shivering through
his scalp

  he took a quick deep furious
draught on his cigarette in just an
instant hed be transported across the
roaring seas into the heart of europes
most romantic wartime capitol

  come in london the announcers
voice repeated

  the static persisted and in it abner
felt he could hear the very smashing of
the waves against each other as the
electric finger of his radio spanned the
watery darkness that lay between two
continents at war

  again the announcers call sounded

  hello london come in

  abner waited tensed for the first


fantastic adventures

sound of the deep magic voice of that
ace war correspondent george holden
grentree and then quite unexpect-
edly the static stopped and the sound
of a piano playing something by de-
bussy came in

  abner small was startled at first
then seized by a sudden sick premoni-
tion of impending disappointment the
premonition was fulfilled an instant
later by the fade-off of the piano and
the voice of the announcer coming back
again

  we are sorry to announce that due
to unforeseen difficulties the program
scheduled over shortwave from lon-
don at this time will not be broadcast

  the words rang sickeningly in abner
smalls ears no broadcast no chance
to hear his idols cool deep military
accents vividly painting the thrilling
canvas of the titanic world struggle
it couldnt be there was probably
only some small minor delay in com-
munication arrangements undoubt-
edly the announcer would be back in
a few minutes to state that the program
was now ready to go ahead as scheduled

  but the piano interlude had picked
up again and there was no announcers
break in the program during the ensu-
ing fifteen minutes other than to state
each selection before it was played by
the pianist

  abner small sat there numbly un-
believingly through the fifteen minute
substitute program and not until it
had reached its conclusion was he ready
to believe that he was actually going to
be deprived of his favorite program

  no he muttered almost sobbingly
it isnt fair the first chance i get
to hear george holden grentree in
three full months-and then this hap-
pens

  and at that instant a thoroughly un-
selfish concern came to abner small

  good heavens he thought i

wonder what prevented the broadcast

  for a minute he deliberated bomb-
ing he wondered aloud could it be
that the boche are over london again
and then an even more dire thought
struck him has anything happened
to george holden grentree that ace of
war correspondents

  abner small began to wonder first
about grentree then about the bomb-
ing by the boche then about london
and war correspondents and   

the raid alarm was shrill in the
night and the beams from a thou-
sand anti-aircraft batteries were lancing
the sky like ghostly fingers of death
seeking the destruction of the horror-
laden enemy hawks above

  the interceptors were already climb-
ing up there the first of them mixing it
in death combat with the jerries off
in the suburbs the first dull thumps of
the bombing was starting boche pilots
already frightened into unloading away
from vital destination

  leaning back against the scant shel-
ter of the building ace war corre-
spondent abner small glanced wryly
at the luminous dials of his watch and
smiled faintly

  that calls off my broadcast to
america tonight he murmured
however he shrugged letting the
word trail off

  an air raid warden hustled up to
him

  better take shelter there johnny
said the warden

  correspondent abner small squared
his shoulders under his trench coat and
pushed back his famous battered war
scribes uniform cap the air raid
warden suddenly grinned in recogni-
tion

  oh sir he said didnt realize
right off- he began

  sall right war correspondent
the other abner small



abner small assured him casually
theyre making a bit of mince meat
out of jerry tonight what

  there was a sudden rocking explo-
sion a few blocks off cutting the
wardens reply off

  correspondent abner small made a
wry half-humorous grimace

  that one was close what

  the warden nodded seriously made
a half salute and hurried away cor-
respondent small wondered briefly
about that last bomb then grim-lipped
decided to light out toward the place
it had landed in spite of the fact that
he had no helmet and hot flak was
falling all around

  hed made a block when he saw a
girl lying there in a corner of the street
unhesitatingly small turned swiftly
and dashed to her side

  she was lying face downward and
when he turned her over he saw that
she was young twenty-two or there-
abouts and extremely beautiful her
hair long soft and golden framed a
lovely oval face and delicately chiseled
features

  she was unconscious

  in a swift motion ace war corre-
spondent small lifted the girl in his
arms there was small shelter of a
sort just across the street it was the
nearest and the most logical sort

  moving quickly abner small crossed
the street with the girl in his arms
gently then he placed her in the shel-
tered section hed discovered no
chance to get her to a regular raid
shelter or aid station until this bomb-
ing ended

  briskly holding her lovely hand in
both of his correspondent small
chaffed the girls wrist

  her eyes opened after scarcely half
a minute of this blue eyes which re-
garded the war correspondent quizzi-
cally and then understanding came

into them and she smiled wryly

  must have been knocked out by a
flying fragment of rock eh she
asked

  correspondent small looked at the
small discoloration on her forehead
smiled his relief and nodded

  you hit it on the head he said or
vice versa thats what did it have
a handkerchief

 phe girl nodded and handed small
a tiny white handkerchief he
touched it gently to the bruised dis-
coloration on her forehead making
certain there was no other wound

  how does it look the girl inquired
it really doesnt hurt me a bit you
know

   i think its going to result in nothing
more than a slight headache a little
later small smiled

  the girl rose to her feet standing
close to small in the shelter smiling
gratefully up at him

  thanks awfully she said i
might have gotten a bad one lying there
helpless if you hadnt come along

  it was an opportunity for which i
should be grateful small said gal-
lantly the girl was even lovelier than
he had first imagined

  i must be on she said suddenly
and for an instant their eyes met while
in that glance a world was born between
them

  but you cant small began

  she touched his hand well meet
again really we will she assured him
and when we do ill be glad

  and before small had time to stop
her she was gone dashing down the
street in the direction from which he
had come

  he didnt try to follow he merely
stood there a moment looking at her
and smiling softly to himself

  but i dont know her name he


fantastic adventures

suddenly exclaimed

  he looked down at the small white
handkerchief still in his hand she
had forgotten it he touched it to his
lips catching the faintly taunting scent
of exquisite perfume and then he saw
the tiny monogram in the corner

  e s were the letters there

  you were perfectly right e s
correspondent small murmured quiet-
ly we will meet again for ive some-
thing at least to start my search on
tomorrow

  and then lowering his head against
the falling flak ace war correspondent
abner small set out for that section a
block away that had caught a bit of
the bombing earnestly he prayed
that all the poor devils in the sector
had been in shelter at the time it hit
otherwise thered be some grim   

re you always asleep with your
eyes open fathead a voice de-
manded in shrill anger breaking
through abner smalls wool-gathering

  eh abner looked up startledly

  velma wearing her fur coat over a
housedress stood in front of him glar-
ing irately she repeated her question
in the same tone

  i ah was thinking abner small
muttered

  thinking eh velma laughed
harshly thats really rich if youve
ever had a thought in your head that
wasnt woolly id-

  good god

  the startled exclamation came from
the lips of abner small and with it he
succeeded for once in cutting off his
wife startled velma glared down at
him

  a bner small was holding a tiny white
handkerchief in his hand-a womans
handkerchief obviously

  velma saw that her spouse was star-
ing at it in open-mouthed astonishment

  where did that come from she
demanded in sudden harsh suspicion
and if this is some sort of an act
whats it all about

  but abner didnt answer he con-
tinued to stare at the dainty handker-
chief he raised it slightly and caught
the taunting scent of exquisite perfume

  and it was then that he saw the
initials e s in the corner

  velmas voice came shrilly to him
again

  where did you get that she de-
manded its a womans handkerchief
and it isnt mine

  it was then that little mr small
looked up at his wife and smiled in a
most curious manner

  no he agreed quietly it isnt
yours you wouldnt have a handker-
chief like this ever it belongs to
someone else

  the dark clouds of suspicion in vel-
mas expression changed to sudden
harsh scorn

  hah she rasped another wo-
mans handkerchief is it and if it
is where did you find it its a cinch
no other woman is ever gonna relieve
me of you i wouldnt be that lucky
abner small stood up the exceed-
ingly curious smile still on his lips he
seemed scarcely to notice his wife he
fished absently into his pocket and
found a cigarette then he lighted it
expelling the smoke thoughtfully at the
ceiling

  id like to tell you about all this
he said softly but youre far too
stupid ever to understand its really
quite incredible most unbelievably
wonderful

  the scorn slid from velmas face
and dark suspicion and a faint tinge of
fear replaced it she stared wordlessly
at her husband warily

  i dont understand it really my-
self abner small was saying that
the other abner small



strange smile still at the corners of his
mouth its all so utterly impossible
and paradoxically real k looked
down at the handkerchief in his hand
again shaking his head unbelievingly
im sure of it and thats all i can say
determinedly abner small started
toward the hallway

  velma watched him brush past her
wordlessly her expression was now
distinctly that of distrust and even
stronger fear

  calmly abner small was slipping
into his coat

  where are you going velma de-
manded harshly

  he continued to put on his coat
answering as he did so

  i really dont know and thats the
truth but it will be the sort of a
place ive always wanted to be in
what are you talking about
abner small buttoned his coat took
his black little derby from the rack he
disregarded his rubbers and umbrella

  im not certain that i know myself
he declared but im going to find out
very shortly goodbye velma
abner small had his hand on the
doorknob he turned briefly to smile
at his wife it was the same curious
smile a smile that was to haunt and
irritate velma to her grave

  goodbye he repeated without
malice

that night the night which
was forever to be known to the
neighbors in his block as the night
abner small disappeared little mr
small did considerable walking

  it was after all a selection a choice
at which one could not be expected to
arrive at lightly especially an abner
small and so it was that his long
leisurely thoughtful stroll through the
night went on for a number of hours
before he at last reached his decision

  by what reasoning mr small ar-
rived at that decision no one will ever
know certainly he could have se-
lected a pattern which might well have
been more magnificent than the one he
chose a pattern which for a fact
could undoubtedly have permitted his
dead to live eternally in history

  but such was not the mind of mr
abner small the course he at last
selected proved perhaps that the glory
of the thing had never really been the
motivating factor in those pathetic day-
dreams proved in fact that the
principle of the thing was all that had
ever mattered to him

  and when at last he did make his
decision he knew without having to be
told that it would be successful he
knew that the opening chain of a day-
dream about that role he chose to en-
act would be all that was necessary he
began that daydream  

rjphe blaze of the stricken oil tanker
must have been visible for miles
across the blackness of the night and
the gently swelling sea but visible or
not there was no chance that rescue
would arrive in time to gain revenge on
the gaunt black silhouette of the nazi
submarine lying safely off from its
burning prey

  perhaps the surfaced sub was wait-
ing to make certain that the flames
would be enough to send the blazing
tanker to the bottom of the ocean or
perhaps the machine gunners on its
deck had begged their ruthless com-
mander to allow them time to perforate
the few poor devils whod escaped in
a half handful of lifeboats

  at any rate the sub was lingering
standing off from the blazing pyre that
had once been an oil carrier unconsci-
ous of the fact that it was impossible
for any mortal on earth to still be alive
on the smoke-blackened tankers in-


fantastic adventures

ferno-razed decks

  the tanker had had a gun for de-
fense but its crew was dead now
killed in the first explosion from the
hold which was too bad for that gun
was loaded and trained rather accu-
rately on the side of the surfaced nazi
sub

  yet incredibly a scorched blitered
oil-smeared creature crawled stub-
bornly toward the side of the tankers
single gun he was a little man and
his name was abner small but no one
was ever going to know that yes he
was a tattered blackened spectre of a
man a half-burned piece of humanity
who dragged himself erect behind the
sights of that remaining gun

  he laughed like hell through blis-
tered lips when he saw how nicely those
sights were trained laughed like hell
to think the agonizing and perhaps im-
possible task of loading that gun was
spared him by the fact that the dead

crew had already inserted a shell and
closed the breech

  there was plenty of time to fire that
gun and hero abner small utilized it
to the last second and when the shell
banged forth it made a hit such as no
submarine in the world could survive

  nothing was left of the shark-like
hull of the black nazi sub but oil and
twisted plate fragments and little else
was left of the oil tanker in the deafen-
ing explosion that split it asunder just
a minute after the sub was hit nothing
was left intact on either craft

  not even a recognizable scrap of
little mr abner small for his had
been a daydream from which even such
a thunderous explosion could not jar
him and it is more than reasonably
certain that little mr small would have
cursed roundly any soul whod tried to
rouse him from his final bit of wool-
gathering

rats are expert dieticians

people often refer to the dumb animals
when speaking about tiiem but in many
ways these dumb animals may be smarter
than humans take as an example of animal
ingenuity rats and mice when offered a selec-
tion of foods they will invariably choose those
giving them an adequate diet to promote a nor-
mal growth they will always choose foods
containing a better grade amount of proteins
in preference to foods of low grade somehow
or other they also choose those foods with the
vitamins they need

  of course they can be fooled into choosing
inferior diets that are faked to smell like bet-
ter ones but the rats are not fooled for long
it doesnt take them long to forsake the more
appetizing diets and revert to the diets they
know are more healthy for them

  rats are also able to distinguish poisoned
from pure food and if the poison is selenium
in any of its compounds the rats will starve
before touching the food they are even clever
enough to distinguish between foods that con-
tain selenium in various amounts and they know
just how much selenium they can stand with-
out harm so that foods with a higher poison
content are not touched moreover when the
rats discover that their diet is even slightly poi-
soned they immediately cut down their food
intake to the barest minimum

  if rats are depleted of vitamin b and are
then given two diets only one of which con-
tains the vitamin they will always choose the
diet with the vitamin but if they are not de-
pleted they will eat either diet and a rat that
has been once depleted will always choose the
same diet even though it contains only a small
amount of the vitamin instead of taking a
chance on a new diet offered it without the
vitamin

  experiments have been made showing that rats
when young can be educated to choose a diet
rich in vitamins instead of one poor in them
however if the vitamin is fed to the rat in a
highly concentrated form it may not recognize
when the vitamin is present or not this can
be overcome by flavoring the vitamin-rich diet
with cocoa or meat extract and the rats will
choose it every time

  thus scientists conclude that the vitamin-
depleted rat does not choose the correct diet be-
cause of instinct but because it has built up an
association pattern beween identifying signs of
the correct diet and its experience that this diet
brings the best results

  in this way rats as well as other so called
dumb animals prove that they know even
better than humans what is good and what is
bad for them

stomach cancer test

ever on the look-out for any device or
test that will bring science one step nearer
to victory in its continual fight against
cancer the national advisory cancer council
has approved a grant of  to be used for
continued study of a test devised by dr edmund
n goodman

  the test has been highly successful to-date
having accurately distinguished between cancer
and ulcer of the stomach in  of the cases
tested moreover results obtained show that the
earlier the test can be made the greater the
accuracy of the test however the council di-
rectors warn the public against being too opti-
mistic since the test has only been tried on
between iso and  patients the test consists
of a measurement of the electrical potential dif-
ferences across the patients stomach membranes
when milk is in the stomach

	 

            solid ink
the solution to all the problems that printers
- have had with drying the liquid ink on their
printing seems to be found with the discovery
of solid ink which dries the minute it touches
the paper this new process was developed by
j m huber inc of new york city and is
known as the velo cold set process

  when this new ink is at room temperature
before being used it looks just like the liquid
inks after they have dried on the paper the
solid ink is used with a printing press on which
the ink fountain metal rollers and plate cylin-
ders are kept warm to about  degrees fahr-
enheit

  these warmed parts of the press keep the ink
in liquid condition but just as soon as it touches
the paper which is at the room temperature
the ink solidifies

  through the entire process of being melted
and solidified the ink does not change chemi-
cally the inked printing plates are left clean
after the paper comes in contact with them for
the cooler paper freezes the ink which is trans-
ferred to the paper bodily moreover the ink
does not harden or gum on the press and this
does away with the present job of washups

shot blasting for strength

a ccording to f p zimmerli chief engineer

  	for the barnes-gabson-raymond division of
the associated spring corporation a process used
for some years to increase the strength of auto
springs can also be used to increase the strength
of steel parts of airplane motors

  the process is called shot blasting and in-
volves the bombarding of the parts with tiny
hard steel balls to hammer their surface into an
extremely hard and smooth finish when ap-
plied to the making of auto springs the shot
blasting process increased the useful life of the
spring to a million and a half bends instead of
the former fifty thousand this new process
not only gave car owners great service but also
saved steel that would otherwise be needed for
replacements this conserving of materials is
especially important today with a war going on
and thus mr zimmerli is in favor of shot blast-
ing the connecting rods and other airplane motor
parts that are subjected to heavy strains instead
of grinding and polishing them this would give
greater strength and also might lead to the pro-
duction of the parts with a lower steel content

  mr zimmerli also says that the process can
be adapted to parts made from aluminum alloys
phosphor bronze nickel steel and other ferrous
alloys

	 

termites conquered

tf your house is located on land infested
- with termites you can protect it against the
pests by simply pouring used lubricating oil at
every point where the building touches the
ground according to prof j c cross of the
texas college of arts and industries located at
kingsville texas

  this theory was based on mr cross experi-
ment with a house built on soil heavily infested
with termites the house has  concrete piers
in its foundation and he poured a quart of used
oil into little ditches around each of them oil
was also poured around the base of the chimney
but one place near some concrete steps was
overlooked the overlooked spot was the only
one used by the termites to enter the house

  the oil will stay in the ground for long peri-
ods and will not spread over two or three inches
from the ditch for in mr cross case it did
not even affect the shrubbery six inches away

    bookshelf

         by villiam p mcgivern

      phillip poincare liberated more than a
      dust-encrusted novel when he discovered
      the original alexander dumas manuscript
      hidden in his precious french bookshelf

mi


phillip poincare was a

small undistinguished man with
pale sensitive features and hair
that was graying slightly at the temples

  however on this particular morning
as he hurried along michigan boule-
vard there was an unusual flush of
excitement on his face and his small
neatly gloved hands were clenching and
unclenching nervously

  mon dien if i am too late he
murmured to himself for the dozenth
time

  at this thought his hurrying steps
quickened perceptibly panting
slightly from his exertions he turned off
the boulevard and continued rapidly
down a narrow twisting side-street that
was lined with taverns and small shops

  he did not stop until he reached a

major lanser lunged forward
in a deadly fencers crouch
certain of a quick victory


fantastic adventures

used furniture shop the windows of
which were so grime-crusted that it was
practically impossible to see the vari-
ous goods on display

  with nervous apprehension phillip
poincare peered through the grimy
glass and as his gaze focused the wor-
ried expression on his face faded away
and was replaced by a relieved smile

  ah he murmured softly my
beauty is still waiting for me

  the object of his attention was a
small dusty book repository of the
period louis quatorze there were in-
numerable pigeon-holes and drawers in
the little cabinet and a flat wide ex-
tension for writing it was supported
by four fragile legs hardly thicker than
pencils

  phillip poincare let out his breath in
one final rapturous sigh and entered the
shop

  the proprietor a fat genial man in
a dirty leather apron put aside his
morning newspaper and heaved himself
to his feet

  good morning he said smiling
i wondered when you was going to
break down and come in ive noticed
you looking in every morning now for
the past month

  it has been thirty-four days phil-
lip poincare said gravely the book-
case in the window i desire very much
to buy what is your price

  the proprietor glanced speculatively
at his customers neat but inexpensive
suit and noticed his slightly frayed
gloves he frowned and began to
scratch his chin thoughtfully

  well its a mighty nice piece of fur-
niture he said people lately seem to
be interested in that kind of stuff

  an expression of worry flitted across
phillip poincares features

  but you have not sold it yes
no its still for sale the propri-
etor said for one hundred bucks

  one hundred dollars phillip poin-
care repeated softly he looked help-
lessly at the bookcase and he blinked
his eyes nervously i see sir thank
you very much i will return when i
have a hundred dollars i did not ex-
pect it to be quite that much

  he walked slowly toward the door

  now just a minute the proprietor
said i might throw off a little on
that price how much was you figuring
on paying

  i have only sixty-four dollars it
has taken me thirty-four days to save
that much you see i began saving the
day i noticed the bookcase in your
window

  sixty-four dollars eh the propri-
etor said musingly are you sure
thats all youve got

  phillip poincare smiled wanly i
am quite sure he said

  the proprietor shrugged

  ill never make a dime this way
but its a deal take it for sixty-four
dollars

  the proprietor was being ambigu-
ously truthful he would not make a
dime he would make approximately
five hundred dimes

jdut phillip poincare turned from
   the door his face shining

  that is extremely good of you he
said he drew a thin well-worn wallet
from his inner coat pocket and care-
fully removed the entire contents ex-
actly sixty-four dollars

  the proprietor of the shop took the
money eagerly

  where do you want it delivered
he asked

  phillip poincare gave him the ad-
dress of a rooming house on the near
north side

  i have informed my landlady to ex-
pect an article of furniture he said
she will let your men into my room
enchanted bookshelf



  fine well have it over before
noon

  thank you phillip poincare said
now i must be going

  the proprietor walked with him to
the door

  not that its any of my business
he said but why are you so interested
in that particular piece of furniture
phillip poincare shrugged his slight
square shoulders and a faint smile
curved his lips

  it is hard to explain even to my-
self he murmured perhaps because
at one time it was a part of france
are you a frenchie

  phillip poincare nodded his sensi-
tive features were clouded

  like that bookcase i too was once
a part of france but it has the hap-
pier memories if it can dream it
dreams of the musketeers and king
louis and the days of frances glory
my dreams are bitter reminders of
laval and darlan and their minions
but- he stopped suddenly and
passed his hand over his brow shaking
his head from side to side forgive
me he said quietly i am not often
a bother such as this good day
when phillip poincare left the furni-
ture shop he glanced at his watch it
was almost  he was due at his
desk in fifteen minutes and he had a
long walk ahead of him he set off
walking swiftly toward michigan bou-
levard

  phillip poincare was at his desk in
the large offices of the bartlett broker-
age company by  it took him
only a moment to change his coat for
the neat gray smock which was prac-
tically the uniform of bartlett em-
ployees and when the nine oclock
buzzer sounded he was busily at work
totalling figures and checking accounts
as he had done every day for the past
twelve years

phillip poincare had come to

  america in  because economic
conditions in france had become so
bad that making a living was practi-
cally an impossibility he had applied
for his citizenship papers because he
thought it only fair that he should pay
his taxes and give his allegiance to the
country whose arms had welcomed him
when he was in desperate need but
a part of his affections had ever re-
mained with his own beautiful france
which he had known and loved so well
because of this sentimental attachment
he had collected in his small room books
and paintings and articles of furniture
that expressed the quiet charm of his
native land it was something of a
hobby with him his only avocation for
he was a shy retiring man and he had
never learned the knack of making
friends quickly and easily

  as sometimes happens to men who
are unable to mix smoothly and nor-
mally with their fellow man phillip
poincare found another existence an-
other life in books of fiction and in
these romantic chronicles of swash-
buckling heroes of other times he en-
joyed a thrilling escape from reality
sometimes when he was lost in the ad-
ventures of some romantic hero he
found it difficult to be sure which was
his real existence so completely did he
live and share the vicissitudes of the
character he happened to be following

  the day passed quickly because part
of his thoughts were busy with the
bookshelf and desk he had acquired that
morning when he had spent a few eve-
nings cleaning and polishing its fine old
wood there would be a wonderful differ-
ence in its appearance although the
sixty-four dollars it had cost him had
been saved from his lunch money and
by scrimping on everything else he
didnt in the least regret the expendi-
ture


fantastic adventures

  when he had completed his work the
five oclock buzzer sounded he cleared
up a few last details dusted off the top
of his desk and was about to slip into
his suit coat when the office manager
an unsmiling sharp-tongued man
named harker came up behind him

  i hope youre not in a hurry poin-
care he said ive got a little job
id like you to finish before you leave

  phillip turned slowly trying to keep
the disappointment out of his face the
other clerks were already jamming their
way through the door laughing and
talking animatedly harker never
asked any of them to put in extra time
it was always he who was assigned such
chores

  i didnt have anything in particular
to do mr harker he said what
is it you want

  you dont sound very happy about
staying harker said he was a big
man wdth a round red face and straight
black hair for some reason he took a
peculiar pleasure in tormenting and hu-
miliating his subordinate phillip poin-
care

  i do not mind staying phillip said
quietly there were times when he
longed for the courage to tell harker
precisely what he thought of him but
he was desperately afraid of what might
happen if he lost his job he had known
hunger and the gnawing fear of inse-
curity the better part of his life and
those privations had left a mark on his
soul any dim spark of revolt that
might have kindled in his breast had
long since been stamped out

  i dont see why you should mind
staying harker said sarcastically
you dont do anything with your spare
time but read those wild books of fic-
tion all the time what do you get out
of that anyway take that yarn about
the three musketeers that de maupas-
sant wrote for instance what sane

man would waste his time reading such
an impossible collection of bilge

  de maupassant did not write the
three musketeers phillip said mildly
dumas the elder wrote it and it
is generally conceded to be a classic

jljarkers ironic smile faded his
cheeks flushed with anger
although he didnt realize it his dis-
like of phillip poincare resulted from
the fact that the mans air of quiet cul-
ture and dignity made him feel in-
ferior

 dumas or de maupassant he
snapped what difference does it
make its still a lot of bilge french-
men just dont have that kind of guts
look at em today bowing and scrap-
ing like beggars before the nazis if
they had any guts would they have quit
fighting when the going got tough
the french people fought until
their ammunition was exhausted phil-
lip said he was conscious of a hot
flame of anger running through his
veins only then did they lay down
their arms and they are fighting now
with the underground movement hin-
dering the nazi machine in every way
they can

  bah harker said scornfully
theyre glad to have someone shout
orders at em thats the kind of peo-
ple they are

  the french people phillip said
his voice trembling have had the mis-
fortune to be duped by their unscrupu-
lous leaders but they hate nazism as
bitterly as we do here in america and
when the time is ripe they will prove
that to the satisfaction of the world
the time is now harker said
loudly what are they waiting for
if they hate the nazis why dont they
revolt

  it is not easy when a bayonet is at
ones throat phillip said simply
enchanted bookshelf

m

  that proves my point harker
said triumphantly theyre just gut-
less and afraid thats all and the
frogs always have been thats why
those adventure books you read are
such a waste of time the only place
youll ever find a brave frenchman is
right where you look for them-in a
book of fiction

 but-

  i havent any more time to waste
harker said rudely if youre smart
youll think about what i said youve
got the wrong slant on a lot of things
poincare now get busy youll find
the work ive laid out for you on my
desk it shouldnt take you more than
an hour or so

  he turned on his heel and strode
away the arrogant swing of his walk
and the cocky angle of his beefy shoul-
ders indicated more clearly than could
any words his complete satisfaction
with his handling of the discussion

  phillip waited until he had left the
office then he slumped into his chair
staring unseeingly ahead of him while
he hated harker he realized with sick-
ening clarity that at the moment he
hated himself still more

  finally he roused himself from his
black reverie and began walking al-
though he worked steadily and swiftly
it was two hours later before he left
the office and started homeward

chapter ii

yhen phhlip poincare had fin-
ished his frugal evening meal he
caught a street car and rode northward
to his boarding house

  his landlady met him in the hall

  there were some furniture men here
today she announced i let them
into your room they delivered another
one of them antiques youre so inter-
ested in

  thank you phillip said

  with anticipation quickening his
steps he ascended the carpeted stairs to
his room the annoying worries of the
day slipped from his shoulders and a
cheery whistle was on his lips as he
entered his room and snapped on the
lights

  the first object that met his eyes
was the bookshelf that he had acquired
that morning the delivery men had
left it in the middle of the floor

  phillip surveyed it lovingly some-
how it seemed even more beautiful and
perfect here in his room than it had in
the furniture store his room was fur-
nished with graceful early french fur-
niture and the walls were lined with
books and softly tinted tapestries
against this background his newly ac-
quired bookshelf seemed perfectly in
place

  he got a cloth from the closet and
set about polishing its fine close
grained surface on his knees he dusted
the under sides of the book shelf and
burnished its slender curving legs

  the job took him almost an hour
but when he was finished the book-
shelfs surface gleamed with a new
beautiful luster

  phillip studied the results of his la-
bors with satisfaction as a final
measure he pulled out the tiny drawers
dusted their insides and shoved them
back into place with the cloth
wrapped about his index finger he
probed into the tiny pigeonholes scrap-
ing out the dust and the tiny filaments
of spider webs

  just as he was about to climb to his
feet his hand ran against a sharp
splinter on the underside of the lowest
shelf with a worried frown he bent
low to examine it he saw that the thin
wood had warped slightly and cracked
a slim jagged splinter protruded from
the otherwise smooth surface


fantastic adventures

  carefully phillip peeled off the thin
splinter a touch of varnish should
completely hide the faint scar he
thought he lit a match and bent down
again to examine the damage

  the patch where the splinter had
been removed gleamed whitely against
the dark mahogany of the shelf and
on this white scar phillip saw faint
scratches that looked like writing

  excited he bent closer and struck
another match in the bright illumina-
tion he saw clearly that the scratches
spelled a name and when he read
that name he felt his heart beginning
to beat faster

  for the signature scratched in small
crude strokes on the underside of the
shelf was that of alexander dumas
the alexander wasnt spelled out of
course but who else could a dumas
be but frances immortal writer of ro-
mances

  phillip sat back on his heels and the
match in his hand burned down to his
lingers absent-mindedly he dropped
the match to the carpet for his thoughts
were hundreds of years away

  supposing this was the bookshelf and
desk of alexander dumas the
thought sent tingling shivers through
his body

  with trembling fingers he began a
systematic exploration of the desk if
it had been the property of alexander
dumas there might be other identify-
ing marks which he had overlooked
but although he did not miss an inch
of the desks surface he found nothing
else to indicate that it had once been
owned by the creator of the three
musketeers

ije returned again to the
a crudely scratched signature for
a few seconds he studied it carefully
then he ran his fingers over the faint
scratches when he did this he felt

the wood give slightly beneath the tips
of his fingers

  he tipped the desk on its side a
strange excitement flooding through his
veins again his fingers moved over
the signature but this time he pressed
gently but firmly against the wood a
section of the underside of the shelf
gave way and phillip heard a faint
creaking sound from the side of the
desk

  moving quickly around to the side
of the desk he saw that a small drawer
had slid out from the apparently solid
side of the desk so cleverly was this
secret compartment fitted into the desk
that phillips minute examination had
failed to reveal its presence

  experimentally he slowly closed the
drawer then he again pressed the
section of the shelf on which the name
of a dumas was scratched and again
the secret drawer swung slowly open

  phillip dug his hand into the drawer
felt crackling paper under his fingers
hurriedly he removed the object his
fingers had touched a long flat bundle
of papers covered with a close fine
scroll

  he flipped through the pages and as
occasional phrases caught his eye his
heart began to hammer with suppressed
excitement this carelessly wrapped
bundle of sheets was a french manu-
script of dumas immortal romance
the three musketeers

  phillip knew the novel by heart al-
most and he could not be mistaken
this might even be the original manu-
script in dumas own handwriting

  hardly able to believe his good for-
tune phillip raptly turned the pages
of the manuscript caught again by the
spell of dumas magic the thrilling
character of dartagnan and the three
musketeers athos porthos and ara-
mis strode again across the pages
somehow more real and alive in this
enchanted bookshelf



dust-encrusted manuscript than they
had ever been in the neat pages of a
book

  as phillip turned the pages of the
manuscript dust puffed up from the yel-
lowed cracked sheets and swirled
about his head in a dense suffocating
fog

  he coughed and waved away the lit-
tle clouds of dust with his hand from
the open drawer in which he had dis-
covered the manuscript more dust
drifted up until the entire room was
hazy with the musty fog

  phillip blew his nose and wiped the
dust from his smarting eyes but these
measures helped but little for the dust
continued to swirl up from the drawer
and manuscript like smoke rising from
a banked fire

  alarmed phillip laid aside the man-
uscript and climbed to his feet but
something seemed to be wrong with him
his legs were unsteady and there was
a vast roaring sound between his ears
he knew that he needed air but he
was too dizzy to walk to the window

  the room was now so filled with the
swirling fog of smoke that he was un-
able to see a foot in front of him and
he realized that he must get out or he
would suffocate

  stumbling blindly he turned and
staggered toward the door but before
he had moved a yard his knees gave
way and he fell forward to his knees
and then to his face

  there was a cloudy film of blackness
obscuring his vision and his muscles re-
fused to respond to the instinctive urg-
ings of his brain

  he wondered fleetingly if he were dy-
ing if so it was not exactly unpleas-
ant everything was foggy and hazy
but the floor seemed soft and comfort-
able and he felt that if he closed his
eyes he would drift quietly into a peace-
ful slumber as his last conscious

thoughts faded he imagined he heard
voices behind him and as blackness
claimed him he fancied he felt a strong
hand on his shoulder shaking him ur-
gently

chapter iii

  ivj on dieu i fear our little lib-
erator will never open his eyes

again 

  a pity he looks so pale comrades
a flask of good burgundy wine would
put the glow of good spirits into those
cheeks again id wager

  these voices drifted faintly through
the fogs of darkness which shrouded
phillip poincare and he stirred uneas-
ily

  ah

  he is moving

  excellent

  phillip shook his head side to side
and a white light began to gleam
through the blackness that enveloped
him the voices seemed far away as
consciousness gradually returned he re-
alized that he was seated in a chair and
that a pillow had been propped behind
his head he pressed his hands to his
face as memory suddenly returned to
him what had happened

  he had been working on the book-
shelf polishing and cleaning it when
he had discovered the little secret
drawer and in the secret drawer he
had found the manuscript yellow and
cracked and aged then had come the
smothering suffocating dust   

he shuddered and opened his eyes

  for an instant he stared in growing
incredulity at the four strangely clad
men who looked down at him with
friendly concern in their faces then he
closed his eyes tightly and pressed his
hands to face

  delirium tremens he gasped
and i havent taken a drink in years


fantastic adventures

  he opened his eyes again slowly hes-
itantly expecting that the apparitions
would have vanished but they were still
there regarding him with frankly puz-
zled expressions

  they looked from one to another and
shrugged their shoulders significantly as
phillip continued to stare at them in
pop-eyed astonishment

  phillip pinched himself to make sure
that he was awake

  who are you he gasped what
are you doing in my room

  as he spoke his gaze swung from fig-
ure to figure automatically drinking in
the details of their dress and person all
four were better than average in height
and they were all dressed in cloaks
blazing baldrics and gleaming leather
boots that came up to the middle of
their thighs sweeping plumed hats
were set rakishly on their dark hair but
the comic-opera effect was not carried
out in the long flashing swords that
grazed the floor or the heavy pistols
that were jammed into their gaudy
waistbands these weapons looked
grimly business-like and there was
something in the eyes and manner of
the men regarding him that indicated
they would know how to use those
weapons with skill and relish

phillip swallowed although he
had an average degree of courage
there was something in the weirdness of
this situation that unnerved him

  he clenched his hands nervously
who are you he asked again this
time his voice was a bare whisper

  the young man standing directly in
front of him removed his sweeping hat
with a flourish and bowed phillip saw
that his hair was curling and brown
almost the same shade as his eyes the
face of this young man was lean and
handsome and now it wore an expres-
sion of whimsical friendliness but

phillip had the indefinable feeling tht
that expression could change that those
jaws could harden and that those warm
brown eyes would glint as coldly as ice
if the sword at his side was unsheathed

  with a thousand pardons the
young man said smiling we have
completely forgotten our manners
with your permission i will introduce
ourselves

  he waved negligently to the largest
of his companions a veritable giant of
a man with heavy powerful shoulders
and mighty steel-thewed hands

  this ox-like creature he mur-
mured we call porthos

  turning from porthos he patted the
shoulder of the fair-haired plump man
who stood beside him

  this noble soul is aramis the
young man said and last we come to
athos the pride of the ladies of the
court the fond friend of the perfumers
and lace makers and the coolest blade
in france

  with a slight flourish he bowed to the
last of the strange company a tall seri-
ous faced young man with firm mobile
lips and soft warmly colored eyes

  phillip stared dazedly at the four cos-
tumed men his heart was hammering
with a deafening sound in his ears
those names   

  athos porthos aramis

  what did this mean was it all some
colossal hoax

  he turned beseechingly to the dash-
ing young man who had made the in-
troductions

  who are you where did you come
from

  the tall young man with the lean
face and smiling eyes whipped out his
gleaming blade and raised it in a salute
he laughed and a ringlet of brown hair
fell over his forehead

  my name is gascon he answered
gascon dartagnan at your service
enchanted bookshelf



although the good cardinal has called
me many other uncomplimentary things
men know me simply as dartagnan

  dartagnan phillip breathed the
word slowly

  yes the young man said he
smiled and sheathed his sword now
if there is aught we can do to repay you
for your great service i insist that you
name it do you have enemies por-
thos will wring their necks and athos
will run them through for you aramis
will pray for their souls and i will drink
to their everlasting poor health come
name your wish and by the honor of
the kings guard it shall be our com-
mand

  phillips bewildered confusion in-
creased there was an undeniable ring
of sincerity in the young mans voice
and expression but the entire thing was
so preposterous   

  i appreciate your offer he said
haltingly but i dont have any ene-
mies

  that is unfortunate the young
man who called himself dartagnan
said reprovingly if you have no ene-
mies with whom do you fight

  i do not fight anyone phillip an-
swered

  dartagnan regarded him incredu-
lously

  a frenchman who does not fight
it is unbelievable tell me dont you
find life dull my poor good father
gave me nothing but advice but some
of it was beyond measure fight gas-
con  fight always i can hear his old
voice again repeating these words over
and over and being of course a duti-
ful son i have tried faithfully to follow
his instructions

  p o r t h o s and althos exchanged
amused grins

  and it is only in respect to your dear
dead father that you fight eh por-
thos said gravely

phillip found the situation growing
more and more bewildering there
was something weird and hysterical
about the entire scene as if it were
something rehearsed in a madhouse

  gentlemen please he stood up
an imploring note in his voice i ap-
preciate your offers of help but i do not
need your assistance i would be
obliged if you would tell me who you
are and why you are here i have had
a severe shock tonight and i am not in
the mood for practical jokes

  dartagnan looked slightly puzzled
mon ami he said i have told you
who we are how we come to be here
is a long story and i think you have a
right to hear it do you not agree
comrades he asked turning to his
three companions

  the huge porthos nodded

  but of course said aramis and
athos in one voice

  dartagnan strolled up and down the
room for a few moments in silence his
lean features thoughtful and a curious
mellow glint of reminiscence in his dark
expressive eyes

  it is a simple story he said at last
my friends and i for many years en-
joyed a stimulating conflict with his
eminence the cardinal duke de riche-
lieu and you may be sure that the
red duke was a worthy adversary
clever resourceful and as captivated by
a good hard fight as were we dartag-
nan paused and chuckled but in
spite of our many disagreements his
eminence could never bring himself to
be really angry with us sometimes i
think he was secretly glad when we
routed his precious guardsmen for it
amused him to see their pomposity de-
flated however many of our enemies
were not as tolerant as his eminence
i fear they lacked his sense of humor
for they decided one night to put an end
to our fun-loving pranks by the simple


fantastic adventures

expedient of hanging us by our necks
until we lost interest in the procedure
his eminence saved us for he enjoyed
too much our little feud to see us dis-
patched but he was forced to resort to
drastic measures

  and so dartagnan said spread-
ing his hands expressively with the aid
of his immense powers he entombed us
in the manuscript of the great man
whose fertile pen had transmitted our
adventures to paper the dumas pere

  the entombment he said wryly
was supposed to be only a temporary
sojourn but several events beyond even
the almost miraculous ken of his emi-
nence miscarried among these was the
death of his eminence since then we
have waited long for our liberation and
it is to you we owe thanks for that
happy event now do you understand
how and why we are here

  phillip swallowed and sank back
weakly in his chair his brain was
wheeling in dizzy spiralling circles
nothing seemed to make sense least of
all himself for despite his common
sense he found himself believing the
incredible story of this slim assured
young man why he couldnt say

  now dartagnan said briskly
you must tell us where we are and
what year this is and how far are we
from paris

  you are in america phillip said
weakly a century and a half have
passed since the period you speak of
america dartagnan frowned
that is inconvenient but he
shrugged philosophically i suppose it
cant be helped anyway i shall be
glad to inspect the colonies of the good
king

  the mighty porthos shook his head
worriedly

  this i do not like he said ponder-
ously this is a new strange
world i wish to return to my france

as soon as possible

phillip poincare looked at
these sons and heroes of france and
there was a sadness in his eyes they
didnt know

  that is not possible now he said
gently france has been at war with
germany for the past three years it
would be impossible for you to return
there now

  war  dartagnan cried his strong
brown hand closed over the hilt of his
sword our france at war and we
stand here idle

  all the more reason for returning
immediately porthos said

  but you dont understand phillip
said desperately france lost the war
over two years ago they are now a
subject nation

  dartagnans blade leaped from its
sheath its gleaming point swung to a
stop inches from phillips heart

  take care dartagnan said tense-
ly or i will forget the debt i owe you
phillip looked at the glinting point of
the sword and he saw the grimness in
dartagnans eyes but he felt no fear
only a vast pity for these courageous
adventurers from another time

  gentlemen he said i am only
telling the truth france has been de-
feated

  she will rise athos said his eyes
were no longer warm and his full lips
had flattened into a thin hard line

  who was her enemy dartagnan
demanded

  the germans phillip answered
ah  dartagnan made a gesture of
disgust to lose to those beer swilling
swine is an insult to injury he
wheeled about flinging his cape over
his shoulder well comrades what
shall we do

  we return to france athos said
simply what else could we do
enchanted bookshelf



  aramis nodded slowly and porthos
grunted in assent

  there is no way to return to
france phillip cried the sea lanes
are no longer open the entire world
is at war

  dartagnans eyes danced with
pleased excitement

  excellent he cried my greatest
fear has been that i would arise from
my entombment in a world of dullness
and peace comrades we are in luck
from what our friend tells us we can
step out this door and find enemies lurk-
ing in every street and alley

  you will not find enemies here
phillip said shaking his head the
people of america are now at war with
the germans their sympathies are and
have been always with france
this said dartagnan is becom-
ing more complicated each minute he
frowned thoughtfully perhaps you
had better explain everything in detail
to us

  phillip poincare spent that night and
the better part of the next morning at-
tempting to bring the musketeers up to
date and to interpret to them the inter-
national situation with all of its various
ramifications whether he succeeded
he couldnt tell

  athos and aramis dropped off to
sleep in the middle of the narrative and
porthos was nodding wearily before it
was completed only dartagnan lis-
tened eagerly to the entire recital and
when phillip had finished his account
of the modern world he had but one
question to ask

  where can we find this man de
gaulle dartagnan said softly as his
hand closed about the hilt of his sword

chapter iv

f jhe rays of the morning sun awoke
phillip poincare on the following

day with a start he sprang to his feet
he was still fully clothed and he real-
ized that he had fallen asleep in his
chair for a dazed instant his mind
flickered back over the preceding night
and his first thought was that he had
suffered a weird nightmare

  but a glance about the room con-
vinced him that the previous night had
not been a figment of his imagination
for stretched out on the floor in vari-
ous attitudes of slumber were athos
porthos aramis and the dashing dar-
tagnan looking like an innocent child
with his wavy brown hair falling over
one eye and a peaceful smile curving his
lips

  quietly phillip prepared himself for
work he would have to leave them
here during the day and the thought of
what possibly might happen caused a
nervous perspiration to break out on his
forehead

  but he reckoned without his guests

  he was tiptoeing toward the door
hat in hand when dartagnan stretched
and opened one eye

  ah he cried the greetings of
the day my friend

  with a lithe movement he sprang to
his feet stretched his arms over his head
and then drummed his fists against his
chest the three slumbering muketeers
awoke and sat up greetings were ex-
changed and aramis called down the
wrath of the heavens on dartagnan
for arousing them at such an unearthly
hour

  phillip fidgeted uncomfortably his
eyes strayed to the clock

  i must leave you now he said hast-
ily-

  but no dartagnan cried we
shall accompany you comrade we
need you to act as guide and interpreter
in our wanderings come you lazy
dogs on your feet our comrade waits
impatiently


fantastic adventures

but you cant come with me phil-
lip protested i have to go to work
very well dartagnan said we
shall go with you and help after all it
is only fair

  aramis and athos climbed eagerly to
their feet but porthos shook his head
frowning

  leave me here he said things
have happened too quickly for my poor
tired brain to understand i must think
and i need solitude for that

  also dartagnan grinned you
need something with which to think my
ox-like friend but if you wish to re-
main behind so be it

  i must said porthos i am puz-
zled

  then let us be off dartagnan
cried

  and in spite of phillips feeble pro-
tests the musketeers hurried him out
the door down the steps and into the
street his explanations of the night
before had prepared them for the sights
that met their eyes but still they were
highly amazed by the cars shooting by
and the paved streets and brick houses

  dartagnan stretched his arms in the
sunshine

  but it is glorious he cried he
breathed deeply at least the sun and
the wind and the birds and trees have
not changed they are familiar old
friends

  come phillip said nervously we
must hurry

 lead on dartagnan cried
through hells fire we follow

thillip led them down the street to
the street car line where he caught
the car to work with nervous appre-
hension he noticed the curious glances
of pedestrians as they saw the cloaked
and booted figures of the musketeers

  a fat well-dressed man who was also
waiting for a car studied the three

musketeers for an incredulous moment
and then broke into a roar of laughter

he turned and nudged his companion

  look he chortled pointing a fat
finger at the objects of his mirth i
wonder what election bet the lost

  dartagnans lean face flushed an-
grily his hand flashed to the hilt of
his sword but phillip stayed his arm

he meant no harm he whispered

  the color faded from dartagnans
face and his fingers slowly loosened
their grip on his sword hilt but his
eyes were still as cold and hard as dag-
ger points

  it would give me great satisfaction
to spit him like a roasting hen he said
softly

  fortunately at that moment the street
car arrived phillip climbed aboard
and the musketeers followed his action
greatly excited with their new adven-
ture phillip paid the fares and led his
charges into the body of the car

  the fat man who had been waiting
managed to squeeze ahead of phillip
and settle himself in the last available
seat with a smug pleased expression on
his round pompous face not only had
he outmaneuvered phillip but he had
reached the seat an instant ahead of a
slim red-haired young girl who had got-
ten on at the opposite end of the car
the girl was almost knocked off her feet
by his bull-like dash to the seat and she
grabbed a strap just in time to save her-
self from falling

  the street car started with a lurch

  phillip with dexterity born of long
experience clutched at a strap in the
nick of time but dartagnan and his
two companions almost fell to the floor
as they lost their balance

  mon dieu dartagnan cried as
he staggered back this is worse than
that wild steed of mine

heads turned from one end of the
car to the other and amazed glances
enchanted bookshelf



were fixed on the three picturesquely
clad musketeers with the swinging
swords and flopping hats a running
fire of whispered comment spread from
person to person phillip felt acutely
nervous for a while but his worry
abated slightly as he realized that most
of the passengers regarded his compan-
ions as masquerading college youths
he breathed a sigh of relief

  dartagnan tapped him on the shoul-
der

  yes phillip whispered

  dartagnan nodded toward the red-
haired girl who was hanging uncom-
fortably by one hand to the strap as
the car lurched and swayed she had
difficulty keeping her balance phillip
drew a nervous breath as he noticed the
angry spots of color in dartagnans
lean face

  why is the girl left to stand
dartagnan asked coldly what kind
of gentlemen do you breed in this land
his eyes raked contemptuously over
the men seated comfortably reading
their morning newspapers

  quietly phillip whispered this
is no concern of yours please do not
cause a scene here

rthe florid faced fat man and others
had heard dartagnans remarks
they were looking at him with hostile
glances and phillip could hear mutter-
ings from some of he men

  whats it to you buddy the fat
man snapped he settled himself more
comfortably in his seat and glared
angrily at the three musketeers

  dartagnan looked down at the man
and a slow humorless smile curved his
lips

  my fat friend he said gently
your manners are exceeded in repuls-
iveness by your appearance but only
to a slight degree while your legs are
still able to carry your chubby body i

would advise you to leave you have
ceased to amuse me

  phillip gripped dartagnans arm
please he whispered frantically
you are only going to cause trouble
for yourself

  the red-haired girl turned to
dartagnan and her cool green eyes
widened in amazement she was tall
and slender with fine square shoulders
tapering to a slim graceful waist her
light arched eyebrows were drawn to-
gether in a worried frown

  she laid a gloved hand on dartag-
nans forearm

  dont trouble yourself on my ac-
count she said softly i am accus-
tomed to standing

  trouble dartagnan said with
mock incredulity i assure you gra-
cious lady i consider service in your
behalf the highest privilege

  aramis moved forward smiling in-
gratiatingly his eyes moved over the
girls lovely face and form in a slow ad-
miring appraisal

  my companion he said smoothly
is guilty only of an unpardonable un-
derstatement service for you would
be earths highest reward he waved
his arm down the length of the crowded
car choose the location your heart
desires and i aramis assure you it
will be yours within a very few sec-
onds

  college punks the fat man said
loudly to the man next to him thats
all they are

  dartagnan raised one eyebrow and
studied the man thoughtfully

  it was my impression he said
quietly that i told you to leave some
time ago what is the delay my obese
friend

  you aint bluffing me i know my

rights

  dartagnan sighed and slowly drew
his sword


fantastic adventures

  will you run him through asked
aramis with polite interest

  i dislike doing it in public dart-
agnan said regretfully

  i see your point athos said en-
tering the conversation for the first
time he needs to be killed of course
but it should be done in a quiet secluded
vale where he would not be able to
boast of his death

  with a flick of his wrist dartagnan
twirled his sword in the air and its
gleaming point was suddenly grazing
the fat mans gullet

  now my fat one are you still
anxious to stay he asked

  the fat man dropped his paper and
strained against the back of the seat
his breath suddenly rattling in his
throat his distended eyes stared
downward in horror at the point of the
sword

  watch what youre doing he cried
shrilly that thing is touching me
youre liable to hurt somebody
somebody mused dartagnan
no my corpulent one it will be you
who are hurt

  the fat man stared in horror at the
calm icy depths of dartagnans eyes
and suddenly he began to tremble like
a bowl of quivering jelly

  i was only kidding mister he
croaked the lady can have the seat
honest she can just take that sticker
out of my adams apple

  dartagnan smiled gracefully

  i knew you would do the gentle-
manly thing my friend you only
needed a slight-er-prodding in the
right direction but you must remem-
ber to be more prompt in the future

the

point of the sword withdrew
from the mans neck with a grin
dartagnan flicked his wrist and the
flashing blade slashed through the
mans bright silk tie cutting it com-

pletely in two

  hey the man cried that was
a new tie

  consider yourself fortunate athos
said a tie can be replaced but a
jugular vein presents a more difficult
problem

  dartagnan sheathed his sword the
fat man scrambled from the seat and
ducked down the aisle perspiration
streaming down his neck

  dartagnan bowed to the young girl
with a flourish

  our friend had a pressing appoint-
ment and was forced to leave he
smiled i am sure he would be happy
if you would take the seat he has va-
cated

  thank you the girl said uncer-
tainly but you might have gotten
yourself ino trouble on my account and
it wouldnt have been worth it she
sat down and looked up at dartag-
nans tall figure with a peculiar expres-
sion in her eyes

  the days when a mans sword de-
fended a woman are gone she mur-
mured but sometimes-

  she dropped her eyes and dartag-
nan saw that her small shoulders were
shaking softly

  what is it he asked gently is
there anything i can do

  no nothing the girl said in a small
muffled voice she raised her eyes and
he saw that their cool green depths were
misted with tears thank you i am
grateful please leave me now

  phillip took dartagnan by the arm
come he said this is our stop
we must get off here

  but- dartagnan looked down at
the girl with the troubled eyes we
cant leave just now i-

  come phillip said urgently
unwillingly dartagnan followed
phillip down the aisle of the car but
he stopped at the door for one last look
enchanted bookshelf



at the girls small figure then with a
sigh he stepped off the car when it
rattled past them and disappeared
around a bend in the street he shrugged
his shoulders

  i shouldnt have left her he said
gravely she was in trouble

  she was also very beautiful ara-
mis said that would be sufficient
reason for staying

  we must hurry phillip said with
an anxious glance at his watch i
cant afford to be late

  with the musketeers at his heels he
crossed the street toward the huge
stone building that housed the offices
of the bartlett brokerage company

chapter v

yhen phillip reached the glass
doors that led to the main offices
of the bartlett brokerage company he
paused for the first time he began to
wonder if what he was doing was wise

  he swallowed nervously and glanced
at the three musketeers their faces
were beaming expectantly phillip
thought of mr harker and his probable
reaction to an invasion of the office by
three cloaked be-plumed swaggering
young men and he winced the thought
of mr harkers reaction was not
pleasant

  he mopped his damp brow

  what is it dartagnan asked
you seem worried and nervous let
us proceed

  of course phillip said feebly
its just that your presence here might
not be understood

  then you will explain our pres-
ence dartagnan said slapping him
on the back that is all there is to
it

follow me phillip said resignedly
he led the three musketeers into the
office and to his own desk he noticed

with apprehension that the entrance of
his companions did not go unnoticed
his fellow clerks dropped their pencils
practically in unison and then their
jaws dropped open as if they were syn-
chronized

  dartagnan glanced about the large
desk-filled room

  what kind of work is done here
he asked he was obviously not im-
pressed with the surroundings

  we add figures phillip explained
apologetically

  all day dartagnan demanded
do you mean that grown men spend
their days in this airless coop doing
nothing but adding figures it is in-
credible

  phillip poincare had always known
subconsciously that his work was dull
and unimportant but somehow hearing
it from dartagnans lips brought it
home with vivid force

  but he didnt have time to think of
that any longer for from the corner of
his eye he saw the portly red-faced
form of mr harker steaming across
the floor toward his desk

  this is my superior he explained
nervously to the musketeers w-we
musnt do anything to anger him
reminds me of an innkeeper i
knew in gascony athos observed
thoughtfully i remember very well
the day they hung him horse thiev-
ing i think

  mr harker came to an impressive
stop before phillips desk

  good morning mr harker phil-
lip said im sorry i was late

  mr harker ignored the apology
his outraged gaze raked over the non-
chalant musketeers and swung hotly
back to phillip

  what is the meaning of this he
demanded his voice was cold and
angry this is a business office not
a minstrel show who are these men


fantastic adventures

  -er-friends of mine phillip
answered i-i just wanted to show
them the office theyre from-out-
of town

  they look like theyre from an
asylum harker said witheringly he
shoved his hands in the pockets of his
trousers and his abdomen protruded
belligerently get them out of here at
once he snapped ill talk to you
about this later

  athos tapped mr harker on the
shoulder

  have you ever been in gascony
he asked

  what no of course not

  uncommon resemblance athos
muttered he shook his head thought-
fully

  resemblance to whom harker
demanded he seemed slightly con-
fused by the sudden twist in the con-
versation

  you have an amazing likeness to a
horse thief i saw hung there recently
athos said he peered closely suspi-
ciously at harker are you sure
youve never been in gascony he
persisted

  harkers face reddened in rage the
veins at his temples throbbed visibly

  a wise guy eh he shouted

  aramis had quietly drawn his sword
while athos was talking to harker
there was a puckish mischievous
twinkle in his eyes as he gently laid the
flat of the blade against harkers pro-
truding stomach harker was so con-
vulsed with apopletic rage that he was
unaware of the swords pressure against
his vest

  youll suffer for this poincare he
shouted it might cost you your job
this is no laughing matter

a s he finished speaking aramis
flicked his sword downward and
two buttons from harkers vest

dropped to the floor

  his vest spread open and a tuft of
white shirt emerged

  harker glared angrily at his exposed
shirt and then hastily shoved it back
into place

  you-you young whippersnapper 
he cried ill have the law on you for
this

  dartagnan chuckled and leaned
back against phillips desk while athos
slapped a hand against his thigh and
smilingly regarded harkers outburst

  it is only a prank dartagnan
said grinning

  you arent going to beg off that
easily harker fumed ill have the
whole lot of you locked up he glared
contemptuously at their costumes and
a sarcastic smile touched his full lips
its about the sort of thing one would
expect from wearers of those unifcms
the frenchmen were too busy with
schoolboy pranks to fight the nazis
theyre fine for wearing uniforms and
swords but they leave the fighting to
men well i think ill make an ex-
ample of you this prank wont seem
so funny when youre behind bars

  aramis smiled at dartagnan and
athos

  methinks i see the shadow of the
bastille in the distance he murmured

  dartagnans face was white with an-
ger

  methinks i hear the braying of an
ass he said looking at harker

  harker wheeled on phillip

  if you want your job poincare youd
better have a plausible explanation
ready for this when i talk to you to-
night ive been altogether too decent
with you i can see now that i am go-
ing to have to take disciplinary meas-
ures

  phillip had done a little thinking since
harker had started railing at the mus-
keteers he had thought of himself
enchanted bookshelf



and his job and the mental humiliation
he endured in keeping it and he felt
suddenly sick of himself

  i have no explanation mr har-
ker he said not for you at least
these men are my friends and that is
sufficient explanation for their actions
as far as im concerned

  thats dangerous talk poincare
harker said warningly

  phillip studied harker for a moment
and he seemed to see him for the first
time as he was-a fat bullying coward
with his heel on the neck of those who
couldnt fight back phillip smiled
for some reason he felt a wonderful
sense of release and elation he real-
ized with a touch of wonder that slav-
ery was not only a thing of chains and
fetters and that freedom meant more
than mere physical freedom mental
and spiritual freedom were the impor-
tant things to any man who was worthy
of that title

  his smiling silence brought a flush of
blood to harkers cheeks

  wipe that smile off your face he
snarled he advanced threateningly
toward phillip his meaty fists clenched

  phillips first reaction was to retreat
he took a step backward not through
fear but rather uncertainty at that in-
stant his eyes met dartagnans and he
saw the musketeer was regarding him
sadly pityingly

  phillip stopped and squared his
shoulders he knew what he had to do
and he realized he should have done it
years ago

  harker took another step forward
and phillip doubled up his fist and drove
it squarely into his soft protruding
midriff

  harker gasped his face turned a
sickly white then a dull spotted green
he staggered back and doubled up his
hands clutching at his stomach

  dartagnan slapped phillip on the

back well done he said

  harker collapsed into a chair and
his flabby face was damp with perspira-
tion youre through poincare he
said in a strangling voice youre
fired do you hear get out

  youre a little late phillip said i
quit ten seconds ago

  outside in the street a few minutes
later phillip found his new-found con-
fidence waning after all a man had
to do something to keep body and soul
together

 well what now dartagnan
asked

  thats just what i was wondering
phillip answered frowning he glanced
at the musketeers picturesque uni-
forms the first thing we have to do
is to get you some less conspicuous
clothes then well go back to the
apartment and talk this thing over

chapter vi

yyhen they reached phillips apart-
ment a few hours later the mus-
keteers carried bulky packages contain-
ing their uniforms under their arms and
they were attired in the more conven-
tional but less picturesque attire of the
twentieth century

  dartagnan had chosen a soft tweed
and it fitted his lean supple figure with
careless ease except for his long curl-
ing brown hair he could have passed
for a successful advertising executive
athos wore a classic pin stripe in black
but aramis for some reason had se-
lected a gaudy plaid that fitted his
round body without a wrinkle

  phillip opened the door and stepped
into his room the first thing he no-
ticed was that the radio was on full
blast but the second fact that struck
him almost took his breath away

  the room was empty

  porthos was gone


fantastic adventures

  well he said weakly

  dartagnan glanced about the room
worriedly he looked into the closets
and bathroom but there was no sign
of the huge musketeer whom they had
left a few hours before

  where could he have gone dar-
tagnan asked

  just a minute phillip said he
picked up the phone and dialed central
station when the desk sergeants voice
came over the wire phillip cleared his
throat nervously

  i want to report a missing person
he explained hes a-er-stranger
in the city and im afraid he might be
lost hes a big fellow and hes wear-
ing a rather strange costume

  go on the sergeants voice was
suddenly interested what kind of a
costume

  an early french outfit phillip
said cloak and sword high boots and
baldric you wont be able to miss
him

  ill say we wont the sergeants
voice sounded grim hes behind bars
this minute where he belongs

  what gasped phillip whats
the charge

  disorderly conduct disturbing the
peace intoxication resisting arrest-
shall i go on

  no phillip said weakly i get
the general idea

  if you say you know him the ser-
geant said youd better get down here
right away

  ill be right down phillip said he
hung up the phone slowly he was
stunned

  what is the trouble demanded
dartagnan

  porthos has managed to get himself
in trouble with the police phillip ex-
plained worriedly

  ah the gendarmes athos cried
comrades we will need our swords for

this task we must rescue porthos
no phillip said swords wont
help ill get him out you wait here
ill be back in half an hour

  i had better come too darta-
gnan said maybe i can be of help
all right phillip said come
along he turned to athos and ara-
mis dont leave here until we re-
turn

  with dartagnan at his heels he hur-
ried down the steps

  at the central police station they
found the desk-sergeant grim-faced and
unpleasant

  so youre the friends of that big
nut are you the sergeant snapped
glaring from dartagnan to phillip
he put six of our men on the sick list
for the next two weeks when they tried
to bring him in it took two riot squads
to calm him down what the hell is the
matter with him anyway

  phillip mopped his brow and glanced
fleetingly at dartagnan

  im not quite sure sergeant he
said can we see him and talk to him
for a moment

  ok hes quieted down now
where did you pick him up phil-
lip asked

  at the main studio of the federated
broadcasting company

  federated broad- phillips voice
trailed off weakly what was he doing
there

  trying to tear the place down the
sergeant answered laconically i tell
you hes nuttier than a fruit cake

jhillip swallowed and glanced
nervously at dartagnan what had
gotten into the huge porthos he couldnt
even imagine but there didnt seem to
be any point to asking more questions
of the sergeant

  a turnkey led them to the lockup
  porthos was standing at the door of
enchanted bookshelf



a cell his huge hands gripping the bars
and there was a bewildered confused
expression on his broad homely face
one of his eyes was a gorgeous purple
and his lower lip was split his baldric
and cloak were ripped in a number of
places the sword that hung at his
waist was gone

  you got about ten minutes the
turnkey said leaving

  dartagnan stepped close to the
barred door

  dont worry comrade he whis-
pered well get you out of here if we
have to tear the building down
porthos looked at dartagnan and
phillip with sad mournful eyes but he
said nothing

  phillip asked the question he had
been dreading

  what happened porthos

  porthos shrugged his massive shoul-
ders and his eyes were downcast i
am not quite sure he answered rub-
bing one hand over his forehead he
looked up suddenly and his eyes were
flashing but i only did what any
gentleman of honor would have done
under the circumstances and for that
the gendarmes come in swarms and
swarms and drag me off here in a
screeching tumbrill mon dieu i have
never seen so many gendarmes

  but what did you do phillip per-
sisted

  it was not my fault porthos said
stiffly i have learned that i acted
hastily that i acted perhaps foolishly
but how was i to know

  how were you to know what phil-
lip asked

  that it was all make-believe por-
thos said moodily

  start at the beginning phillip said
he wished frantically that porthos
would tell his story and tell it quickly
so that he could start figuring on how
to get him out of jail if that were at

all possible

  when you left i turned on the little
box that makes music porthos said

  you mean after we left the apart-
ment this morning you turned on the
radio phillip asked he was bewil-
dered by porthos irrelevant digression
he had demonstrated the radio to the
musketeers the previous evening
but   

  i turned on the little box that makes
the music porthos repeated glower-
ing

  yes go on phillip said helplessly
he realized that porthos was grimly
determined to tell his story in his own
way

  but i do not hear the music por-
thos said instead i hear voices i
listen carefully one voice is that of a
woman and the other is that of a man
they are arguing the woman has
jewels and the man wants her to give
them to him he is a scoundrel i
could tell it from his voice porthos
eyes were stormy as his mind flashed
back to the villainy of that voice from
the ether i shouted at her not to give
him the jewels he continued but she
could not hear me anyway she did
not need my advice she knew the man
for the scoundrel he was and ordered
him away but he would not leave
they were alone she was helpless
porthos voice trembled with rage he
took them from her by force and left
her bound and helpless in a closet and
the river waters were rising porthos
cried darkly his voice breaking with
the heat of his emotion

  wtiat river phillip asked

  i dont know porthos shrugged
they didnt say but the water was
rising on the bamboo foundations of
the little hut and this poor girl was
helpless the scoundrel had taken
leave with the jewels

  dartagnan had followed porthos


fantastic adventures

narrative with tense interest

  what happened then comrade he
demanded

  another voice came from the little
box porthos said frowning

  and what did this new voice say
i didnt understand it was all
about soap porthos said

  soap

  yes porthos nodded this new
voice talked interminably about a soap
he called sleczy-suds thats all i could
make out

  but the girl dartagnan cried
she will be dead by this time

thillip put a hand to his forehead
wearily he didnt know whether
to laugh or cry he suspected that he
might do both

  go on with your story porthos
he said quietly

  while this man talks about soap
porthos continued i buckle on my
sword my blood is stirred i cannot
stand idle while villainy goes unpun-
ished and damsels need the protection
of my blade

  well spoken dartagnan cried
  go on said phillip

  the voice suddenly stops talking
about soap porthos said excitedly
the voice exclaims who will save
mary malloy i draw my sword
porthos cried gripping the bars in his
excitement i say i will where can
i find this villain 

  yes dartagnan breathed

  the voice porthos said answers
me it says this adventure took
place in the central studios of the
federated broadcasting co the cor-
ners of lake and michigan 

  i think i know the rest phillip
said you went ddwn to the feder-
ated studios to rescue m-ary malloy
didnt you

  but of course porthos said it

was what any red-blooded son of
france would have done

  and things didnt turn out so well
did they

  no porthos said shaking his big
head sadly things did not turn out
well at all no one seemed to under-
stand what i was talking about a
man laughed at me i drew my sword
and then the gendarmes came by the
dozens porthos sighed i have
learned since that the whole thing was
a make-believe play

  phillip patted his shoulder gently
ill talk to the sergeant he said
ill do what i can

  it is all so confusing porthos said
wearily i wish i were back in my
quiet france

  phillip went to look for the sergeant
he didnt know what he was going to
say but he knew he couldnt tell the
truth of the matter if he tried to ex-
plain that porthos a musketeer from
the eighteenth century had gone ber-
serk listening to the fictional tribula-
tions of a heroine in a radio soap
drama he would wind up behind bars
himself

  he found the sergeant at his desk
grimly studying his reports

  well he said looking up youve
seen your friend now maybe youd
be good enough to tell me whats wrong
with him

  er-hes very sorry about the trou-
ble he caused phillip said

  well thats fine the sergeant said
sarcastically hes sorry so well just
open the doors and let him go we will
not

  he lost his head you see phillip
said thinking desperately hes a ra-
dio actor

  i thought there was something
wrong with him the sergeant mut-
tered

  and he forgot himself actors are
enchanted bookshelf



like that sometimes they become so
absorbed in their parts that they just
arent themselves at all

  thats no excuse for a man behav-
ing like tarzan of the apes the ser-
geant said but as long as it wasnt
anything criminal he did we can set
bail for him are you willing to take
him into your custody until his case
comes up

  yes phillip sighed ill take
care of him

  the details were arranged and in an
hour porthos stood outside the jail with
phillip and dartagnan a free man

  well dartagnan said that is
over and now i am hungry and
thirsty let us forget our troubles
with a bottle of wine mon dieu it
seems ages since my palate has wel-
comed a cooling draught of burgundy
porthos shook his head sadly

  my appetite and thirst are gone
forever i think he said i want to
get away from all this strange civiliza-
tion and think

  phillip realized that he too was hun-
gry and if ever a man needed a
drink he was that person

  he hailed a cab and gave the driver
the address of his boarding house
turning to porthos he said this cab
will take you home aramis and athos
are there and they are worried about
you tell them dartagnan and i will
be along soon

  porthos nodded and climbed into
the cab when it had pulled away
from the curb phillip turned to dar-
tagnan

  now for that drink he said

chapter vii

tdhillip led dartagnan to a
swanky bar in one of the downtown
hotels for some reason he felt like
celebrating he knew that the next

day he would have to start thinking
seriously about finding another job
but today he refused to let that worry
him

  they had barely given their order
to a waiter when dartagnan grabbed
his arm excitedly

  look he said at the table on
the other side of the room

  phillip looked and saw a beautiful
young red-haired girl sitting with an
impeccably clad middle-aged man who
wore a gleaming monocle over one eye

  what about them phillip asked
blankly

  it is the girl dartagnan said ex-
citedly the girl i saw on the street
car this morning she was in trouble
how could you forget that face

  phillip looked again and saw that
dartagnan was right the man with
whom she was seated was tall and lean
with cold blue eyes and slightly gray-
ing hair there was a saber scar on
his cheek that pulled his mouth into a
faint perpetual sneer

  what luck dartagnan cried
springing to his feet

  wait a minute phillip said you
cant go over there

  why not

  she is with a man such things
just arent done

  bah it is about time they were
then dartagnan said grinning ex-
cuse me he bowed and strode across
the floor to the girls table nervously
phillip followed thinking he might be
able to smooth over the situation

  dartagnan bowed to the girl with a
flourish

  this is such a great and unexpected
pleasure that i am overwhelmed i
feared this morning that i might never
see you again but the gods are kind
he pulled up a chair and sat down

  the red haired girl looked at him
and there was relief in her eyes


fantastic adventures

  it is nice to see you again she said
warmly i hardly had time to thank
you this morning i see you have
changed your costume

  dartagnan glanced down at his
tweeds and smiled

  yes i was becoming somewhat con-
spicuous

  the girl turned to her companion
major lanser this is the young man
i told you about

  major lanser inclined his head brief-
ly toward dartagnan and then turned
to the girl a humorless smile touched
his thin lips and the saber scar on his
cheek twisted

  how interesting he murmured
will you be good enough to tell him
we are busy

  oh but we arent too busy to talk
to gallant young rescuers the girl said
laughing but there was a strange
odd note to her laughter as if it were
close to hysteria

  how kind of you dartagnan said
his eyes were watching major lanser
with quiet speculation there was a
tension at the table that was smoulder-
ingly tangible

  dartagnan suddenly grinned dis-
armingly and pulled up another chair
to the table and waved to phillip to sit
down

  my friend he explained i hope
you wont mind he smiled at the
girl it will be someone for the major
to talk to

  the majors lean hard face flushed
red as phillip settled hyxtself cautiqusly
at the table phillip felt the peculiar
tension that seemed to crack across the
table and when he looked into the
majors ice-blue slate-hard eyes he felt
a strange prickling of fear

  the major put his hand on the girls
arm

  i think you must bid your friends
good-bye he said quietly it is time

for us to leave

  no the girl said her eyes met
dartagnans in a mute appeal im
-im not ready to leave yet

  i think you are my dear the major
said his fingers closed over the girls
arm and the knuckles of his hand sud-
denly whitened you wouldnt want
to cause your friends any-er-incon-
venience would you

rjphe girls eyes closed and her face
   was gray

  no you mustnt- she said ill
come with you the last words were a
bare whisper

  dartagnans keen eyes flashed like
the glinting blade of a rapier as he
studied major lansers coldly express
sionless face

  major lanser he said softly the
young lady obviously would rather stay
and finish her drink but you mustnt
let that keep you he emphasized the
last word carefully

  the major looked at him for an in-
stant and the silence was tense and
charged then he shrugged and his
hand released the girls arm he stood
up and smiled down at the girl

  you will find my way would have
been wiser he murmured he turned
slightly to face dartagnan and the
smile was gone from his lips i hope
we meet again he said

 when he had gone dartagnan
turned impulsively to the girl

  forgive me but i do not like your
friend he said cant you tell me
what is troubling you it would make
me very happy to be able to help you
you mustnt see me again the girl
said i have already allowed you to
place yourself in a very dangerous po-
sition if you ever see major lanser
again keep well out of his way she
smiled and stood up you have done
me a great service and i will always be
enchanted bookshelf



grateful good-bye

  before dartagnan could speak the
girl moved swiftly away from the table
dartagnan sprang to his feet but the
girl by that time had disappeared
through a door that led to the lobby of
the hotel

  this time i shall not stand like a
stupid clod dartagnan said hurry
there is still time for us to catch her
she needs our help

  phillip paid the waiter his thoughts
were wheeling nervously

  youve got to be careful he said
worriedly to dartagnan that major
lanser is dangerous i could tell that
from his eyes they were as cold as
the eyes of a snake

  but that girl needs help darta-
gnan said impatiently come along
if the major proves troublesome it will
be most unfortunate-for the major
with phillip pattering at his heels he
strode across the floor to the lobby
except for a few men reading news-
papers the room was deserted

  possibly she took a cab phillip
suggested

  grimly dartagnan shoved through
the revolving door to the street he
grabbed the doorman by the arm

  did you see a young lady leave here
a moment ago a tall red-haired
girl

  i called a cab for her the doorman
answered

  was she alone

  yes she was alone when she got
into the cab but a man stepped in after
her before the cab started they left
together

  what did the man look like dar-
tagnan demanded

  the doorman frowned i didnt get
a good look but i noticed he seemed
pretty well dressed and let me see
he wore a monocle i think he had a
scar on his face but im not sure

  did you hear the address they gave
the driver phillip asked

  i think he said mannerly towers
the doorman answered

  call us a cab dartagnan said
what do you intend to do phillip
asked nervously

  follow them of course we may
already be too late

  but if this girl is in trouble phillip
said its a matter for the police you
dont know what you might be sticking
your neck into let me call the station
and have a squad of men sent over to
the mannerly towers

  dartagnan shook his head the
gendarmes have an unhappy faculty of
making a supreme mess of anything
that requires tact and diplomacy we
must handle this ourselves but you
are right in one respect we may need
help call your room and tell aramis
porthos and athos that i need them
and give them the address of mannerly
towers tell them to come there as
quickly as possible i would rather
have them at my side than all the gen-
darmes in the city

  phillip did as he was directed and
when he returned to the sidewalk a cab
was waiting and dartagnan was wait-
ing impatiently

  phillip crawled into the cab beside
dartagnan and sank back against the
cushions as it pulled away from the
curb with a roar

  mannerly towers  dartagnan
snapped quickly

chapter vii-

jartagnan and phillip stepped
from the cab before the imposing
facade of the mannerly towers the
building was located at the near north
side and it had only taken them a few
minutes to reach it but dartagnan had
fidgeted all the way


fantastic adventures

  when phillip paid the driver he
strode toward the main entrance

  dont you think wed better go
around the back way phillip said
theres no point in advertising our
entry

  there is no time for such maneuver-
ing dartagnan said we must de-
pend on the surprise value of a frontal
attack

  the desk clerk looked inquiringly at
them

  we wish to see major lanser
phillip said what is his suite num-
ber

  thirteen-forty the clerk answered
but is the major expecting you

  yes dartagnan snapped

  phillip led the way to the elevators
the elevator operator shot them up to
the thirteenth floor deposited them and
started back down

  the corridor was carpeted with a
luxurious gray rug that muffled their
footsteps as they moved along the hall
to a gleaming white door bearing the
number 

  this is it phillip said in a whisper
but dont you think wed better wait
until athos and the others get here

  i dont know dartagnan frowned

 

  he stopped speaking as the door in
front of them opened and the tall figure
of major lanser appeared in the door-
way

  a pleasant surprise the major said
quietly did you forget that the desk
clerk would inform me that you were
on your way up

  looking over the majors shoulder
phillip saw a long empty room fur-
nished in quiet good taste

  what is it you wanted the major
asked his face was set in hard ex-
pressionless lines but his eyes were as
dull and cold as death

  the girl dartagnan said meet-

ing his gaze squarely we know that
she accompanied you here and it is to
be our pleasure to relieve her of your
unpleasant company

  so the major smiled you are
still playing the role of gallant rescuer
are you i am sorry to disappoint you
the girl is not here you are welcome
to look if that will ease your mind

  he stepped aside and bowed mock-
ingly

  dartagnan regarded him coolly for
an instant then stepped past him into
the long room phillip followed hesi-
tantly the major closed the door and
strolled to the center of the room his
thin face cynically amused

  are you satisfied he said softly

  no dartagnan said he glanced
about the room with narrowed eyes
he noted a set of fencing foils above
the mantle a picture of the major in
uniform but nothing to indicate the
presence of the red-haired girl

  there are other rooms are there
not he asked

  the major smiled i was hoping
you would have enough sense to be sat-
ised but obviously you havent he
raised his hand in a signal and a door
at the end of the room opened a
squat man with a gun in his hand
stepped into the room and moved to the
side wall where his gun covered dar-
tagnan and phillip

  phillip swallowed nervously and he
could hear the terrified thudding of his
heart in the sudden stillness of the
room

  another man stepped through the
doorway but he was not alone at his
side was the red-haired girl her eyes
were enormous pools in the whiteness
of her face phillip saw that her wrists
were taped together behind her

  oh you shouldnt have followed
me she said her voice breaking she
glanced swiftly imploringly at major
enchanted bookshelf



lanser please dont hurt them let
them go they dont know a thing i
give you my word

  your solicitude is very touching
major lanser said but unfortu-
nately i cant do as you suggest it
would be very foolish of me to let them
go now they have already seen too
much no i am sorry but they must
be disposed of as soon as possible

jphillip was standing beside a table

  on which a heavy metal ashtray
rested he was about six feet from the
man who held the gun almost of its
own volition his hand moved slowly to
the ashtray and closed over it his
heart was hammering frantically all
of his cautious common sense instincts
were demanding that he put his hand
back to his side and forget the wild idea
in his head but instead he lifted the
ashtray slowly from the table no one
was watching him no one saw him
move until he turned and threw the
heavy weight squarely at the closely
cropped head of the squat little man
with the gun

  and then it was too late for anyone
to do anything about it for the ash-
tray caught the man directly between
the eyes and he fell forward on his face
without a whimper

  but then everybody in the room
seemed to galvanize into action

  the man beside the girl lunged for-
ward but she tripped him with her foot
as he passed sending him sprawling to
the floor major lanser wheeled and
leaped toward the mantle his hand
dosed over a slim deadly fencing foil
and with an oath he whirled to face
dartagnan

  but the musketeer had moved too
with a lithe sidestep he evaded the
majors savage lunge and leaped for
the other foil with it gleaming in his
hand he swung to meet major lanser

a grim smile on his face

  major lanser moved forward cat-
like the sword in his hand twitching
like a snake about to strike

  this will be interesting he mur-
mured over his shoulder he snapped
to the man who had tripped over the
girls foot watch the others i will
handle our collegiate don quixote
no the girl cried it isnt fair
he hasnt a chance against you

  i will be gentle with him major
lanser smiled he moved forward in
a lithe deadly fencers crouch i will
not kill him quickly

  you fiend the girl cried she
tried vainly to jerk loose from the man
who held her dont duel him she
cried struggling to face dartagnan
dont you see hes planning to cut
you to ribbons

  dartagnan was leaning against the
mantle almost lazily but his narrowed
eyes watched lansers every move

  save your sympathy for the major
he murmured he is more likely to
have need of it i am not exactly un-
accustomed to the sport of fencing
this is not going to be a sporting
contest the major said grimly with
a sudden feint he lunged to the right
then crossed back to the left and his
sword flashed at dartagnan

  philip cried out involuntarily but
dartagnans sword had somehow
sprung magically to meet the majors
and steel crashed unavailingly against
steel

  a good defense the major said
breathing through stiff lips

  let us test yours dartagnan said
cooly

  his sword seemed to flash with the
speed of light his lean body shifted
forward

  a hoarse shuddering gasp broke from
the majors throat

  the point of dartagnans blade was


fantastic adventures

touching his shirt and dartagnan was
poised to lunge a grim merciless smile
hovering about his lips

  the majors sword was at his side
he had been caught completely off
guard by the speed and skill of dartag-
nans thrust

  his breathing was ragged as he
waited for the cold steel to drive for-
ward into his body but dartagnan
stepped back and raised his sword

  en guarde he cried you wanted
time to kill me slowly and i shall give
you all the time you need

  major lanser raised his sword and
stepped back watching dartagnan
with nervously flickering eyes the
stiff hard lines of his face were dissolv-
ing into a mask of fear he wet his
thin lips with his tongue as dartagnan
moved slowly toward him

  it is not really fair for me to use my
right arm dartagnan murmured al-
most to himself athos himself has
trouble with my right arm with a
smile he shifted the foil to his left hand
this should give you a better chance
major lanser

jtajor lanser lunged forward
savagely his face twisted with an
insane rage there was ablazing light
of anticipated triumph in his eyes

  no man alive can stand against me
with his left hand he cried

  dartagnan parried the thrust with
a turn of his wrist without shifting the
position of his body

  there is always the first time for
such things he said

  lanser lunged forward agin his
breath coming raggedly and darta-
gnan slipped to one side with the ease of
a shadow moving against a wall his
blade flashed down in a spinning arc
steel rang against steel as lansers
blade flew from his hand and fell to the
floor a dozen feet from where he stood

  you seem to have lost something
major dartagnan murmured his
blade was resting lightly in his hand and
the major stared at it as if it were
something bewitched

  you-you devil he cried hoarsely
who are you his face was flushed
and there was a flicker of foam on his
lips with a sudden movement he
sprang back and shouted to the man
who was holding the red haired girl

  cover him drop him if he takes a
step toward me

  phillip cried wtch out

  major lansers henchman shifted
around and covered dartagnan with
his gun

  all right buddy he snapped
take one move and ill let you have
it

  dartagnan looked at the man and
shrugged

  you seem to be in the saddle he
said he bowed ironically to major
lanser and tossed his foil to the floor

  the majors breathing gradually re-
turned to normal

  you will pay for that little exhibi-
tion my friend he said to darta-
gnan

  philip watched the scene tensely the
man with the gun a heavy-set florid
individual who looked like a movie
gangster was standing with his back to
the open door about twelve feet from
where he stood there was nothing
within reach which he could throw at
the man and he was too far away to
tackle there was nothing he or any-
one else could do

  you have a silencer on that gun
the major snapped to his gunman let
our young friend have it

  the man raised his gun slowly and
took aim

  at that very instant a huge shape ap-
peared in the doorway behind him and
a deep voice said mon dieu we are
enchanted bookshelf



barely in time

  the gunman wheeled about his face
a mask of incredulous surprise phillip
screamed be careful but his admon-
ition was unnecessary

  porthos huge fist crashed into the
gunmans face the man hit the floor
in a sprawling crash and the gun slipped
from his nervous fingers

  porthos stepped over the thugs body
and athos and aramis followed him into
the room

  athos shook his head slowly

  my dear boy he murmured to
dartagnan wont you ever learn to
keep out of trouble

  dartagnan smiled turning to his
companions and the major seized that
opportunity to make a break ducking
swiftly he scooped up the foil that
dartagnan had dropped and bolted
for the door

  athos was the only person who stood
between him and freedom

  out of my way lanser snarled

  athos was still wearing his pin-stripe
suit but his sword was buckled at this
waist he dropped back a step and his
blade flashed into his hand

  im afraid i dont like your tone
he said quietly

  lanser lunged forward his blade
driving for athos heart but athos
slipped aside easily lanser his eyes
glaring with mad frustration grabbed
the red-haired girl by the waist and
swung her around in front of him as a
shield

  now he grated stand aside 

  with his sword extended he lunged
forward again shielding his body with
the girls

  athos murmured you are making
my task a bit more difficult

tljis smile was like the flicker of light
on a rapier as he feinted to the left
drawing the major in that direction

his move back to the right was quicker
than an eye could follow the sword
in his hand-the coolest most daring
hand in all france-leaped forward like
a bolt of flashing light and major
lanser stiffened involuntarily a cry
breaking from his lips for an instant
his side had been exposed and in that
instant the blade of athos had found
its mark

  with a strangled curse the major re-
leased the girl and stepped back he
tried desperately to raise his sword arm
but it was a vain effort his tall spare
frame broke at the middle and he fell to
the floor and lay still

  dartagnan sprang to the girls side
and removed the tape from her wrists
she swayed against him and he held her
close

  my compliments athos he said
looking over the girls head at his friend
your hand has lost none if its skill 

  athos saluted with his sword fhank
you

  the girl glanced down at the majors
still form and a slight shudder passed
over her slender body

  cant you tell us now what this is
all about dartagnan asked gently

  i can now the girl said i am an
agent for the free french forces of
general de gaulle my mission here
was to pass along vital information to
a british agent when i arrived i was
met by major lanser whose credentials
indicated that he was the british agent
i was seeking but for some reason i
didnt trust him i stalled him off hop-
ing to find something in the meantime
to confirm or alleviate my suspicions
he became more and more insistent
that i pass over my information i
couldnt go to the police or the fbi
because of the confidential nature of my
work she looked at dartagnan
that is when you arrived on the scene
obviously the major could afford to


fantastic adventures

wait no longer for he decided to get the
information from me by force if nec-
essary

  you say you are an agent for the
free french athos asked

  yes sometimes we are called the
fighting french

  there in none other aramis said
dartagnan looked down at the girl
and his lean face was serious

  couldnt we help you in some way
he asked i would be happy to place
my sword under the command of this
general de gaulle

  and i think he would be equally
happy to have you the girl said
there is work to do all over the world
in tunis in africa in london every-
where there is a need for men of re-
sourcefulness and courage

  dartagnan swung about to the three
musketeers

  what say comrades here is the
opportunity of a fighting mans life
the enemy is everywhere the arena is
the world and the prize is our beloved
france

  athos looked down at the floor his
face grave

  aramis porthos and i have been
talking this over he said we are
going to fight for france-but we are
going to fight for france in france on
the soil of own country

  wbut that is not possible the girl
said there is no way to get there
athos glanced fleetingly at aramis
and porthos and then he smiled faintly
we shall find a way he said

  the girl looked at the three men for

an instant and there was a strange won-
der in her eyes

  i believe you will she murmured
softly

phillip watched the scene and there
was a strange constriction in his
throat

  he cleared his throat apologetically

  he said to athos could i go with
you i know many things about the
customs of today that would be valu-
able and i am sure now of not only
what i want to live for but also of what
i wrant to die for

  athos smiled at him and threw an
arm over his shoulder

  why we couldnt get along without
you he said

  phillip felt that something inside his
chest might burst with his happiness

  athos turned to dartagnan and his
smile was sad and gentle

  this is farewell comrade he said

  perhaps dartagnan said but
we have parted in the past comrades
but a strange fate has always brought
us together again

  porthos and aramis joined arms with
athos and with phillip between them
they backed toward the door

  remember athos smiled one for
all-

  dartagnans arm tightened about
the girls shoulder and he looked down
into her shining face and all for one
he murmured

  when he looked up the doorway was
empty

nerve injury detector

dr robert wartenburg of the

has devised a thumb-tip test which de-

mon wartime nerve injuries

  the patient holds his fingers together while

thumb tips touch each other the median nerve
running through the wrist is not damaged if

the patient cannot make the thumb tips touch
the nerve is affected the tip of the thumb on
the affected side being higher than that of the

bloch

it was early afternoon in jacks
shack the restaurant was almost
empty when i came in and so was
i i ordered a meal and then sat back
watching the proprietor he was train-
ing a couple of new waiters evidently-
teaching them how to put their thumbs
in the soup how to trip a customer
that doesnt tip and other necessary
elements of the waiters craft

i was watching jack show one pupil
how to spill gravy on a tablecloth when



 i got a sample myself

 not gravy ketchup

 the red goo spattered down the back
 of my neck

 stop it jack i yelled im not
 going to be a guinea pig for your new
 help if you must have a customer to
 spill things on buy a window dummy

jack didnt hear me and the
ketchup spattered down

 i whirled around clenching my fists

listen you- i began then


fantastic adventures

halted there was no waiter behind
me

  standing there holding a hamburger
in trembling fingers was none other
than lefty feep

  its you is it i sighed

  the tall dark and unhandsome mr
feep gave me a feeble smile and an-
other splash of ketchup

  cut that out i admonished

  feep nodded and tottered into a
chair

  i am sorry it is you i do with the
goo he apologized but my pinkies
shake so that i cannot catch up with
my ketchup

  whats wrong i asked have
you got the palsy

  it is not the palsy palsy-walsy
explained lefty feep

  st vitus

  st frightus maybe a groan is-
sued from under the hamburger

 you-frightened the idea
seemed incredible but one look at
that doleful face told its own story

  whatever is the matter i in-
quired you look as though youve
seen a ghost

  that is not the trouble at all said
feep it is the other way around
other way around

  yes a ghost sees me

  quit kidding i laughed there
are no such things as ghosts thats
just an old superstition

  well you ought to see the old su-
perstition that i see a couple days ago
then

  you had an experience with a
ghost

  experience compared to what i
go through the life of a spiritualist is
just medium lefty feep announced
when i get finished i go to my doctor
for a blood test and find out it is all
curdled

  you must have been really scared

  scared my hair is raised so high
the barber has to stand on a stepladder
to cut it

  i had a strange feeling i was going
to hear a story about all this chat-
tering teeth couldnt stop lefty feeps
chattering tongue

  i wasnt mistaken

  listen whispered feep i will
recite a fright

  cupping his chin in his hands and
parting his trembling lips lefty feep
began to deliver his shiver



j am running down the drag the
other day in a very rapid hurry
because i do not wish to be late for the
most important appointment in my life
i am keeping a date to drown myself

  i am on the beam to the nearest
stream ready for a suicide slide

  why do i decide to take myself to
the exterminators this way well i
have five good reasons

  the first three reasons are my ex-
wives

  the fourth reason is my exchequer
i am broke

  the fifth reason is the worst i just
get myself turned down by the draft
board because of a few mistakes i make
in my early youth the guy at the
board is very sarcastic too he says
i have enough criminal records to fill
a phonograph album

  for some reason or other this burns
me up plenty because i am now re-
formed and i want to get in there and
slug for my country like a patriotic
citizen

  but they turn me down and my
wives track me down and my pocket-
book gets me down

  so i am ready to go down to the river
and dunk myself

  pretty soon i arrive at a bridge i
pick out-a little bridge down by the
docks where the traffic ia light i pick
the chance of a ghost



it out on purpose because i am afraid
of being run over by a car before i can
commit suicide

  i stand there and look down at the
water for a long time i figure i will
review my mistakes and faults-but
then i give up because i dont wish to
stand there for a solid week

  so i start to take off my clothes 
am wearing a very sporty suit and
naturally i do not care to get it all wet
when i drown myself

  i strip off the coat vest shirt and
tie then i remove the trousers and
stand there in my shorts it is cold
and i know i must jump in a hurry if
i do not wish to freeze to death

  the water looks mean and green i
shiver at the river but i climb up on
the railing of the bridge and close my
eyes it is a long long jump down

  well i whisper here goes

  and i jump

  i whistle through the air i grit my
teeth for the moment when i splash
into the water

  down down down here it comes
now-

 whambo

  i land but not on water

  on wood on my noggin

  for a minute i am out cold but
since i land on my head i am not
severely injured so i manage to open
my eyes and there i am sitting after
a perfect three-point landing

  blow me down and out yells a
voice in my ear a stowaway 

  i blink and look around i am squat-
ting on the deck of a boat which must
pass under the bridge just as i jump

  standing next to me is an old duffer
with white chin-fuzz on a pile of wrin-
kles he uses for a face he is a very
fierce looking pappy and he is yelling
away at the top of his lungs

 stowaway he repeats go
away

  i am not in the mood for poetry

  i get up on my feet and give him a
glare and stare

  listen sea-dog cut out the bark-
ing i advise i am sorry i happen
to land on this garbage scow of yours
garbage scow howls the old boy
you call the best craft on the seven
seas a garbage scow ill keelhaul you
you landlubber

cure enough when i take another
look around i realize i am not on
any garbage scow but a house-boat
this barge has a sort of little cottage
up front all painted and decorated and
scrubbed clean the boat is small but
it looks very neat and orderly

  where am i i ask softening my
hollering a little

  you are now on the good ship
floating kidney says pappy i am
captain rivers better known as old
man rivers

  pleased to meet you i pipe i
am lefty feep

  the pleasure is all yours says old
man rivers and now might i in-
quire what in blazes you mean by
boarding my boat

  just a mistake i tell him i
really am bound for the bottom of the
river

  you mean you plan to scupper
yourself

  i am going to scupper skipper i
answer

  dont be foolish a husky young
fellow like you-why youd make a fine
able seaman

  i feel more like a disabled seaman
after that swan dive i take when i hit
the deck i confess

  well here take a swig of rum of-
fers old man rivers pulling out a
flask

  i take a gulp and feel much better
even though i seem to start a small


fantastic adventures

bonfire in my stomach

  how about some hard-tack asks
old man rivers

  no thanks but i will take an-
other shot of that stuff

  i drink again the bonfire in my
stomach gets hotter and indians seem
to be dancing around it

  you even drink like a sailor he
tells me say how would you like to
sign articles with me im off on a
voyage

  off on a voyage

  certainly fm heaving out to sea
right now

  in this houseboat

  got the port papers and everything
vessel is ship-shape just about steers
itself fine engine ten knots an
hour

  knots i ask

  well miles then miles to me
knots to you

  i let this pass

  but why should i go to sea i ask
besides how do i know you are a good
sailor yourself

 you ask me old man rivers
whether or not i am a good sailor me
-that used to run a rowboat conces-
sion in the park i can pilot every-
thing from a motorboat to noahs
ark

  personally i figure this guy cant
navigate anything except maybe a
schooner of beer

  but what have i got to lose maybe
this old bird has a reason for taking
his daffy little houseboat out on the
ocean

  sure enough he comes out with it
he bends close to me and grabs my
hand

  come up with me while i steer
he says i will tell you a secret

  so i go into the pilots cabin or what-
ever and he grabs hold of the steering
wheel and swings the houseboat out up

the river again

  i dont know why i tell you this
he begins except that i am getting
old and a voyage like his is going to
be a strain besides you can do the
digging

  digging in the water

  no on land you freshwater fishl
on the island 

  what island

  the island were heading for

  he peers over my shoulder he grins
he whispers

  would you like to look at my map
you have a very repulsive map i
tell him

  no-herel he yaps pulling a piece
of paper out of his sailor jacket the
treasure map

  treasure

  of course what do you think you
are going to dig for

  clams maybe i tell him he is
infuriated also a little angry

  we are off to find captain kidds
treasure he announces

  wait a minute i suggest you
may be off yes but not to find treas-
ure and who are you trying to kid
about captain kidd

  avast there and stow the gab
says old man rivers do you think
an old seagull like myself would risk
life and limb on the ocean if there
wasnt a sure thing involved let me
tell you a few things about captain
kidd and his treasure before you run
up a distress signal

  so rivers tells me about captain
william kidd this billy the kidd
it turns out is a personality who
flourishes back in the gay s or
thereabouts he is what is known tech-
nically as a pirate though today he
would be called a sea-going hijacker

jje sails with a mob when he is a
young squirt then reforms and
the chance of a ghost



gets a pardon from the king of eng-
land not only does he get a pardon
but he plans to do a stoolie on his old
pals in fact he is commissioned to go
out with another ship and clean up the
other pirates which he does he
sails off to the african coast and pretty
soon he is knocking off a lot of ships
filled with gold and silver and jewels
and other valuable keepsakes

  but this kidd is not only smart he
is clever first he double-crosses his
old pirate pals and then he pulls a
triple-cross on his friend the king he
collects treasure but instead of turn-
ing it over to the government he evades
the income tax by sailing away to am-
erica and turning pirate again he
even takes one of the ships he captures
to make his getaway-like it is a hot
car or something

  when he gets to the american coast
he decides to put some of the swag
away for a while until it cools off just
where he stows the loot nobody knows
but it is a cinch the stuff does not go
into a safety-deposit box

  he plants it on some islands and
buries it deep at least that is the
story-and it must be true because
a little later on he gets nabbed by the
law-and-orders he confesses but does
not peep about the treasure pretty
soon he has a slight argument with a
rope and comes out on the losing end

  anyway that is the story of captain
kidd but the story of his treasure is
another matter for hundreds of years
various citizens are on the lookout for
the gold digging up half of the ameri-
can coast and raising more sand than
a water-spaniel

  funny part of it is somebody finds
a chunk of his hot money over on
gardiners island near long island-
of all places they locate about sixty
grand in bullion but the rest of it-
millions-nobody can find including

secretary morgenthau and the fbi

  the story goes that it is buried near
new york somewhere a whole lot of
bullion says old man rivers

     sounds like a lot of bull to me
i decide after hearing the yarn

  then look at this chart old man
rivers urges and he holds out the
map for me

  i give it a squint the paper is old
and yellow and crumbling and the
lines on the map are all faded the
writing is very quaint too but i see
a picture of a little island stuck out
past the local bays so tiny that it is
almost hidden away there are a lot
of figures on the paper-latitude and
longitude and altitude and gratitude
and all that nautical stuff-but i am
interested only in the writing on the
center of the island map

  dig here says the chart ten
paces behind stone four feet down
until skull is reached further direc-
tions in skull ye treafure awaits
that settles it

  ye treafure i snort ye gods
the guy cant even spell

  its an old chart grunts the sea-
dog ancient writers use an t for an
s that goes to prove the map is
genuine and look here

  he points to the back of the chart
under a yellow stain i see a very faint
lettering wm kidd-hyf mark
thyf if fylly i yell

  why so asks old man rivers i
get it from a trusty friend

  well why doesnt the guy who owns
this chart originally go after the treas-
ure himself then if he believes it
he is an old man rivers explains
an old sailor with a wooden leg he
cant make the voyage with me because
his leg is recently attacked by wood-
peckers at present he is under the
care of a surgeon a tree surgeon
rivers adds with a thoughtful sigh


fantastic adventures

  woodpeckers should get a feast
from his head too i sneer but ac-
tually i am falling for this idea the
map looks good i think of all that
pirate treasure i read about-pieces of
eight doubloons gold bars bullion
buccaneers from the spanish main
why shouldnt i lend my spanish might
and main to this trip we are sail-
ing and the island is not far outside
the harbor

  well mutters old man rivers
what do you say will you sign ar-
ticles with me for this voyage share
and share alike

  treasure is my pleasure i tell
him

  we shake hands over the steering-
wheel and the voyage really begins

ryhe old houseboat really steams
down the river in a fine fashion
and old man rivers knows how to
handle the floating kidney

  i have no work to do at all he steers
and i sit in a rocking chair on deck
after while i go into the houseboat
cabin which is just like a little parlor
and kitchen and knock out a few flap-
jacks for supper

  when i take them back on deck to
where old man rivers is steering we
glide out into open water past the
harbor the houseboat bobs up and
down on the long ocean waves but it
rides very well and we sit and stare
out at the sunset and eat our flapjacks
it gets dark and quiet

  where do e sleep i yawn

  why in the bunks

  i sleep in a bed and thats no bunk
i insist

  well turn in and get a good rest
tomorrow you may have to dig or
fight

  fight i perk up my ears you
do not mention fighting on the program
before

  i know old man rivers grins
i am just joking you know there
is a silly superstition that the ghost
of captain kidd guards his treasure

  when it comes to fighting ghosts
i am not worried i assure him

  fine you sleep and ill steer
says old man rivers looks like
a little fog coming up

  so i go into the cabin and plunk
into a bunk i look out at the black
water and at the grey smoke of the
fog curling up all around and shiver
a little because it is cold then i drowse
off for a while wondering about tomor-
row and the treasure and pirates and-

  ship ahoy calls a voice

  i sit up the voice comes very faint
and far away

  ship ahoy belay there were
coming alongside

  i jump out of the bunk barking my
elbow and then barking the voice
comes from the side of the houseboat
i lean over the rail down below is
nothing but the thick grey fog

  i turn around to call old man rivers
but then i see the figures

  they rise up out of the fog so fast
i think they are just part of the fog
itself

  as they come over the side climb-
ing up the rail to the deck i look again
and i get a real shock

  they are fog

  three figures grey as mist thin
smoky wavering i can see through
them

tut there they stand on the deck
three foggy figures three men
from the mist a short fat fellow
wearing a three-cornered hat a tall
thin bald-headed fink a big chunk
of blubber that is all stomach and
beard

  who in hades are you i pause
to inquire
the chance of a ghost



  ah allow us to introduce our-
selves the short fat fellow takes off
his hat and bows

  i am william kidd better known
as captain kidd

  the tall thin fink nods his head
he pulls a long curly wig out of his
pocket and puts it on

  i sir am major stede bonnet late
of his majestys service but a gentle-
man privateer

  the big bozo just grins and looks
me in the eye

  teach edward teach he grunts
men call be blackbeard

  i just stare with my mouth open
like a stuffed moose

  somebody around here is crazy and
i have a good idea its me

  three finks made out of a fog step on
deck and claim to be captain kidd
stede bonnet and blackbeard the
pirate

  kidd looks more like an old goat to
me

  bonnet looks like he has bees in his

  blackbeard resembles a fugitive from
a barber college

  but it is their look of fog that has me
agog

 who-what-where are you i
ask feeling like professor quiz but
looking more like a guy who is scared
stiff which i am

  buccaneers freebooters pirates-
call us what you will snaps the lug
who says he is william kidd our
names mean little our deeds loom
large on historys pages

  writ in blood adds stede bonnet

  blood  booms blackbeard with a
nasty grin

  but i get control of myself after
all i can see right through these foggy
babies

  why you anemic-looking impos-
ters i mutter you palefaced pre-
varicators 

  take that back i snaps kidd

  all right-limp liars then i know
that captain kidd and all the rest of
the pirates are dead over two hundred
years

  right you are mate booms black-
beard we are dead men all dead
pirates but dead or alive we take no
insults so-

  on the word so he whips some-
thing out frpm the side of his belt it
is long and gleaming a sword and
there is nothing foggy about its wicked
curving length

  yes snaps stede bonnet sud-
denly a long thin blade appears in his
hand a rapier i guess

t turn around i have a vague idea
i would like to take a short but
swift race around the deck

  but there stands captain kidd with
a mean-looking sabre

  steel makes a sharp argument he
purrs it also has the saving virtue of
cutting arguments short and arguers
whos arguing i answer all
right so you are really captain wil-
liam kidd

  at your service says he lowering
the sabre though long dangling from
execution dock has wrenched my neck
out of joint i fear

  mine too adds major stede bon-
net stroking his thin throat with deli-
cate fingers

  a trifle blackbeard chuckles i
am beheaded no less by that dog of a
maynard even in my ghostly state it
is distinctly a pain in the neck

  fortunately we are all buried at
sea kidd says else we should not
be here now special permission you
know

  special permission

  from our mate and free companion
below

  below


fantastic adventures

  at the bottom of the sea where we
slumber with all good pirates and hardy
adventurers he comes back but now
we rise together

  and just why i ask

  why because of the treasure
thats why isnt this the good ship
floating kidney doesnt the master
captain rivers possess a chart show-
ing where my treasure lies hidden
well- i stall

  exactly captain kidd spiiles a
foggy smile doesnt it occur to you
that the gold and bullion you seek is
rightfully my property

  but-- 

  for nearly two hundred and fifty
years i am a restless spirit a wraith
that cannot sleep peacefully beneath
the sea because ive lost my treasure
you see i am a forgetful man the
location of that treasure is something
even i cannot remember the chart
you possess is the only genuine one so
i await your search to lead me to mv
gold

  you forget where you hide the
swag very careless i scold him

  i too have no memory major
stede bonnet chimes in so i enter
into agreement with kidd that we will
search for each others treasures share
and share alike

  i bury fortunes while drunk
blackbeard growls this is unwise i
know but unavoidable-because i am
never sober i also have a pact with
my two friends-as gallant gentlemen
as ever slit a throat

  we make a deal with our free com-
panion from below kidd explains to
wander once again as ghosts seeking
our hidden treasure trove and so we
come to you you will lead us to the
spot tomorrow

  maybe i better ask old man rivers
about that little matter i suggest
as you wish growls blackbeard

lead the way me hearty

  i lead the way but i am far from
hearty with this party

  old man rivers is steering along
through the fog when i brush through
the dandruff and tap his shoulder

  pardon me i say we have some
visitors

  visitors how could they get
aboard where who

  he turns around and looks at the
three pirates looks through the three
pirates

  the explanation dawns on him

  ghosts he yells shiver my tim-
bers

  my timbers shiver too i tell him

  who are these gaunt haunts he
asks

  captain kidd makes with the explan-
ation again

  old man rivers doesnt like it any
better than i do

  so captain kidd makes with the cut-
lass

  old man rivers decides he will obey

  steer your course man says kidd
you will either lead us to the treasure
tomorrow or walk the plank

  walk the plank quavers old man
rivers

  there is also a rope trick i learn
from the hangman suggests stede
bonnet very gently

  youd hang me in a noose mur-
murs old man rivers

  no noose is good noose i tell him
we better do like these gorill-these
gentlemen advise we will take them
to their treasure

  why not adds captain kidd
its really mine you know-after all
i steal it

  very logical i agree

  steer away then captain rivers
chuckles blackbeard we will be your
passengers on this voyage good to
feel the salt air again got any rum
the chance of a ghost



  yes-rum exclaims stede bonnet

co i take them into the houseboat
cabin and set up the rum under
the lamp light the three of them are
pretty ugly looking customers grey
pale thin ghost-figures i shudder
when i pour

  careful with that stuff yells black-
beard or ill slice your gullet you
chicken-livered squab

  rum sighs captain kidd its
mothers milk to me

  evidently it is because he pours him-
self about a quart of the stuff out of
the big jug on the table and guzzles it
down

  thin as he is he can hold rum so
can the others while i sit and watch
they gargle it all away

  ha ha yaps blackbeard spirits
for spirits thats what i always say

  a haunting we will go cackles
stede bonnet taking off his wig and
wiping his bald forehead

  it is true the ghosts are getting
drunk just three sheets in the wind

  gentlemen-by bloody harry ive
a great ideal  yells captain kidd bang-
ing on the table with one transparent
fist

  spit it out urges blackbeard
yes elucidate major stede bon-
net chimes in

  simple tomorrow these two dogs
dig up the treasure right

  if they know whats good for them
its right

  then we take the treasure with us
and divvy up the swag with our free
companion below isnt it so it is on
this agreement that he consents to let
us go and roam earth again
correct says stede bonnet
only thats where my idea comes
in hiccups captain kidd why
should we divvy up with him below
lets take the treasures and split it

amongst ourselves then we can be
free to roam the earth he wont catch
us ghosts or no ghosts-well be rich
splendid idea laughs stede bon-
net

 old captain kidd chuckles
blackbeard up to your double-cross-
ing tricks again eh suits mel

  who wants to be under water
sneers captain kidd

  right you are id rather be under
rum blackbeard howls

  i turn the lamp a little lower they
do not not need so much light now be-
ing lit themselves then i sneak out
of the cabin and run up to old man
rivers

what are we going to do i ask
what can we do we must take
them to the treasures i suppose
shrugs rivers i guess there is some-
thing in that ghost story after all
cant we get rid of them

how can you kill a ghost

  i doubt it

  but they can kill us all right
  that i dont doubt

  so we find them the treasure old
man rivers decides

  so we do

  i do not sleep that night at all the
three of them are howling away in the
cabin and we stand out and steer
along about sunrise old man rivers
looks at his chart again

  almost there he tells me unless
i am mistaken thats the island looming
up ahead well circle around to the
inlet

  sure enough a little hunk of land-
just a big sandbar really sticking up
out of the water-is on our starboard
bow wherever that is

  in about half an hour we are right
outside the inlet the water is calm
and shallow

  heave the anchor  yells captain
rivers


fantastic adventures

  i never swallow it i answer but
it turns out he wants me to throw a
hunk of iron overboard at the ends of
a rope this is the way a boat is
parked

  so i heave the anchor and we all get
into a little rowboat which we push over
the side of the floating kidney

r jhe three ghost pirates are no pret-
tier in the daytime but with their
fggy grey faces the hangovers dont
show up they are very happy in fact
because they are right on the verge of
laying hands on all that treasure

  we row them on to the beach and
climb out old man rivers has me lug
up a couple of shovels and a pick he
marches ahead with the chart pacing
off feet

  pretty soon we cross the bare sand
and hit a white stone

  count from here rivers says

  aha-i recognize this spot yells
captain kidd

  rivers counts off ten paces

  dig he tells me

  i look at the pirates arent you go-
ing to help me i inquire

  blackbeard has his cutlass out

  dig he suggests

  i dig

  i am down about four feet-a nice
depth for a grave and i feel like lying
down in it-when i strike something
something hard and white

  reaching down i pull it out of the
sand

  a grinning skull

  here snaps captain kidd i rec-
ognize this too why its diego he
gasps blast my bones its diego

  he holds the skull up alas poor
diego i knew him well i ought to-
i cave his throat in with a pick when
he buries the treasure

  bonnet and blackbeard laugh very
loud at this but somehow i do not ap-

preciate the joke i merely grin very
feebly like the skull

  further directions in the skull
captain rivers says reading his chart
what does that mean

  why this says captain kidd he
reaches into the grinning mouth with
two fingers scrabbles around and pulls
out a little leather pouch from the jaws
he opens the pouch and fetches out a
scrap of paper

  forty paces left he reads ye
treafure awaits

  we walk forty paces left thirty
paces anyway then we are at waters
edge

  land washes away kidd explains
out into the water with you feep
ten paces then dig

  who me

  but before the cutlass comes out
again i am in the water digging away
and of all the dirty digs i take in my
time this is the worst

  to make along with the story never
mind the digging i wish i feel the
same way about it-but it ends it
ends when i strike the first iron box
and haul it up on the beach slow

  i pick the lock with the pick and
open it

  gold bars and bars of gold

  more boxes growls captain kidd

  i dig further and strike another iron
box i cant even budge this one with-
out old man rivers to help me

  more gold

  a third box is hauled out then a
fourth and fifth one has silver an-
other has coins in it and the last one
contains nothing but jewels-emeralds
rubies and pearls big stones that
gleam in the sun

  a half million pounds sterling
raves captain kidd

  all ours adds stede bonnet

  hey i suggest what about
me
the chance of a ghost



 you where do you come in
sneers blackbeard patting his fat belly
with a frown

  well-union labor for all that dig-
ging you must owe me around three
bucks anyhow

  pipe down shouts blackbeard
lug this aboard the ship and well cast
off hurry now or well maroon you
two on this island

  better do as he says captain
rivers tells me

co one at a time i row the boxes
back to the boat i hoist them up
on an old cable after tying rope around
them it takes a couple of hours and
at the end of that time i am as limp
as yesterdays paper napkins

  in fact when they are all safe on
board again i can hardly raise my head
let alone the anchor that is what i
want to do-let alone the anchor-but
the three pirates make me pull it up

  i dont dare disobey they stand
there-captain kidd with his long hair
and fat face and little glittering black
eyes stede bonnet with a face like an
old mummy and long rat teeth gleam-
ing big blackbeard with his red eyes
glaring through a hairy jungle-and i
am very unhappy about the whole
thing

  since they find the treasure the
three of them are in high spirits being
ghosts this is understandable

  i laugh every time i think of it
captain kidd says as we get under
way again our friend below will be
half-crazy when we dont show up with
the treasure as the promise stands

  a capital jest stede bonnet
agrees gadzooks what need has he
of treasure acres of it down there
were off to land blackbeard
smirks land and rum well bathe
in the stuff and when we run through
this swag well hunt more treasure

  he strides up to where old man
rivers is steering

  more speed he urges these
newfangled steam engines on boats-
cant compare them with our sailing
ships

 take my quedah merchantkidd
says theres a saucy vessel for you
ive not set foot on a ship for two hun-
dred years and more ah-

  oh i correct him

  and oh it is because looking
over the port bow i see something in
the water ahead

  it is long and grey and pointed it
rises form the water in a very rapid
manner

  one look and i recognize it two
looks and i see the swastika on the
side

  look i yell a german sub-
marine

  it is nothing else but one of the
atlantic coast u-boats up for air

  submarine whats a submarine
asks captain kidd

  this is no time to get technical i
gasp theyre going to sink us

  sink my treasure damn their
eyes let them try it snarls captain
kidd

  but they have machine guns and
torpedos and-

  what are they asks stede bon-
net

  youll find out i tremble

  bring em on blackbeard grates

  old man rivers stops steering

  im going down to shut off the en-
gines he tells me they have us
spotted all right we cant run for it
best stand by and surrender when they
come alongside

  surrender never  yells black-
beard

  but when the submarine coasts closer
the three ghost pirates get a look at the
deadly metal prow and hull at the gun-


fantastic adventures

turrets on the deck they begin to
appreciate what modern pirates can do

lets go below suggests captain
kidd abruptly i dont like this

thing

a jhey scuttle over into the house-
boat cabin old man rivers comes
back and joins me

  now what do we do i ask

  he shakes his head and stares at the
grey sides of the approaching u-boat
the water is draining off the decks and
it is so close we can see the drops
splattering down

  what can we do whispers old
man rivers a houseboat cant fight
a german submarine theyll prob-
ably come aboard search us find the
treasure then sink us

  but well drown i yeh

  dont you tell me you are ready to
drown yourself yesterday snaps old
man rivers

  yes but i change my mind

  well change it back again judg-
ing from the looks of this swab well
both taste salt water soon enough and
i dont mean taffy

  the swab he refers to is the guy
who now steps out on the submarine
deck he is a big german bulldog
wearing an officers uniform he is
close enough to yell over

  surrender in the name of the third
reich he yells or we will your boat
gesink

  we are gesunk i whisper
nothing else to do grumbles old
man rivers we surrender he calls
to the submarine commander

  stand by and we will aboard ge-
commen barks the sausage in the uni-
form

  sure enough we stand by while the
submarine cruises alongside us pretty
soon a whole crew of nazis climb out
on deck-probably to get a little fresh

air they look at the floating kidney
and laugh and point and sneer we
stand there and take it what else
can we do

  then they throw an iron ladder
across from the side of the submarine
deck to our deck and march over
the whole crowd of krauts comes
across

  heil hitler snaps the commander
raising his arm like he wishes to leave
the room

  hell hitler captain rivers an-
swers politely

  we will now your boat gesearch
he announces

  gesearch and be gedamned says
captain rivers

  so a gang of nazi sailors stamps off
to the cabin where the steering wheel
stands

  oh oh i mumble thats where
we put the treasure-remember

  but it is too late to distract them
in a minute they are running out jab-
bering german the commander goes
with them and pretty soon he comes
out with a big smile the rest of the
nazis come out with a big load-the
treasure they dump it on deck

  you carry a valuable cargo hein
for a boat so small remarks the com-
mander and what is in the other
cabin

  nothing at all says captain riv-
ers no need to look there

  aha yaps the commander more
valuables you maybe gehaben

  you are mis-gestaken i yell

  we will a look take he decides
with a leer

  i do not leer i know what is in the
cabin the three cowardly pirate
ghosts

  but the gang turns around with the
commander leading the way and goose-
steps over to the cabin the com-
mander opens the door grins goes in
the chance of a ghost



the rest of them pile after him

  they will scare the ectoplasm right
out of our pirate pals i mumble
suppose they are hiding under their
bunks right now

  all at once i get my ears split by a
shriek

  ach du lieber yells a voice

  himmel comes another dop-
pelgangersi

inhere is a rush and a roar and
the whole crew bursts out on deck
again running for dear life and right
behind them waving their cutlasses
and ready to cuttle with them come
captain kidd stede bonnet and
blackbeard the pirate

  steal our treasure will you you
black-gizzard spawn of a sparrow
howls blackbeard take that and
he swoops his blade down on the com-
mander attacking him with a surprise
thrust to the rear

  the commander does a quick flank
movement around the deck

  thief screams captain kidd
lunging at a sailor the nazi pulls
out a gun and fires the bullet goes
right through the smoky figure of kidd
the nazi goes through a convulsion
fit he runs

  stede bonnet is trying to strangle
another sailor with his wig ill teach
you to board a pirate ship he hollers

  ghosts and doppelgangers the
sailors scream racing around the deck
the pirates hop after them

  blackbeard is something terrific to
see in action he would make a good
wrestler-he butts with his head he
uses his hips like a conga dancer and
his beard stands up on end when he
jumps at a sailor

  his big cutlass swings like a pen-
dulum pretty soon he has the wholfe
crew in a corner

  i turn around and look at stede

bonnet and captain kidd they are
leaning over the side of the rail doing
something then they wheel and re-
join blackbeard

  over the side with them kidd
yells feed the fishes with the scum 

  they drive the submarine crcw
around to where the iron ladder con-
nects the two ships the crew jumps
up on the fail ready to escape to the
submarine

  but when they get to the top of the
rail the ladder is gone it seems stede
bonnet and captain kidd drop it into
the water

  it is too late for the crew to do any-
thing about it the three fighting
ghosts are hacking at them from behind
and they jump overboard

  you too yelps blackbeard lift-
ing the submarine commander by the
naval base he throws him down

  now sings out stede bonnet from
the steering wheel he is swinging the
houseboat over-over towards where
the nazis are swimming in the water

  i close my eyes and ears for a min-
ute then it is all over

  the water is empty and so is the
submarine drifting off on our port
bow

  that finishes those bloody pirates
says stede bonnet and good rid-
dance hessian dogs

  stacking our treasure on deck to
move it over the side sniffs captain
kidd and into an outlandish tin
boat too those fools arent sailors

  beats me old man rivers re-
marks just outside the harbor too
pretty bold

  just outride the harbor echoes
captain kidd you mean well land
soon

  another few hours old man
rivers points off to the shore line

  fine well take the treasure oft
and- captain kidd stops he is


fantastic adventures

staring at us with a very curious ex-
pression all at once he beckons to
blackboard and stede bonnet they
go into a huddle

  i nudge old man rivers

  they are in a huddle i point out
and something tells me we wont like
the signals they call

  that doesnt worry me half as much
as this answers captain rivers he
points up at the sky

gure enough from out of nowhere
black clouds are swirling a storm
is coming up but fast

  a wind whips over the deck the
waves turn dark green almost black
they rise high

  better get back to steering decides
old man rivers

  never mind captain kidd looks
up and speaks

  why not

  we steer from here

  but why not let me steer

  dead men dont steer

  but im alive

  not for long mutters captain
kidd

  what do you mean asks old man
rivers

  i have another idea to begin with
we are double-crossing our pal below
by taking the treasure on land so
why not make the job complete by
double-crossing you and making off
with the boat too

  typical of captain kidds brilliant
if undisciplined mind stede bonnet
comments with a wolfish sneer

  look mutters blackbeard
heres a plank

  plank i mention who needs
a plank

  you do blackbeard tells me
youre going to walk it

  walk the plank but ill drown
  thats the general idea captain

kidd chuckles now you two-line
up he yells suddenly making with
his sword again

  stede bonnet and blackbeard lay
the plank over the rail and weight down
the other end with the anchor and rope

  theres a fine gateway to the bot-
tom of the sea says captain kidd
have a nice trip

  the boat is rolling and pitching now
in the swells the wind howls and
captain kidd has to howl above it

  out you go he shrieks poking at
me and old man rivers with his sword

  steer you fool  screams rivers as
the boat rocks

  never mind-you walk the plank
first captain kidds face is as black
as the storm the three pirates stand
behind us silvery figures in the dark-
ness their swords wave

  i stand out on the plank and shiver
the water yawns below

  hurry up and jump calls black-
beard and say hello to our friend
down below tell him we couldnt
bring him back any treasure he
laughs like a wolf above the howling
waves

  it is a moment i do not forget the
black sky is above me and the black
sea is below me the three gleaming
pirate ghosts are behind me shoving
me along the plank

  jump snarls captain kidd slash-
ing at me with his buccaneering mani-
cure-set

  then it happens

  the thunder roars the boat lurches
and the three pirates turn around-but
too late

  the treasure that the nazis drag
out on deck is sliding over the five
chests crash into the rail-and through
the rail

  bleach my bones screams black-
beard he dives for the chests

  they sail gracefully through the
the chance of a ghost



splintered railing and go kerplunk into
the water

  hes taking our treasure yells
captain kidd hes double-crossing
me william kidd its an outrage

  all three of the pirates lean over the
side of the boat and stare at the swell-
ing water while the chests sink

  old man rivers and i see our chance
and jump off the plank with the boat
lurching and pitching and tossing we
can hardly keep our feet

  the storm is really on now

vhile the three pirates hang on
the rail i get busy i loosen the
plank we are supposed to walk i wait
for the boat to swing it around

  then i yell at kidd bonnet and
blackbeard they are much too oc-
cupied to pay attenion to me

  which is just what i want

  while they hang on to the rail i
hang on to my loose plank i aim it
carefully at the three silvery figures of
the pirate ghosts and when the boat
gives the proper lurch i let it go it
swings across the deck and smacks
hard

  blackbeard bonnet and captain
kidd sail up over the rail and drop into
the water

  there is a single squawk another
bolt of lightning and crash of thunder
and the swashbuckling spirits are gone
below the waves following the treasure

  old man rivers takes the steering
wheel ready to wrestle with the ele-
ments but the funny part of it is
right after the pirates leave us the
storm dies down we make port in
about an hour

  i never see a storm like that one
old man rivers says shaking his head

  there is a lot you never see before
on this voyage i remind him three
ghost pirates a buried treasure a battle
with a submarine and a near yank at

walking the plank

  but that storm mutters old man
rivers it bothers me

  it bothers the pirates more i re-
ply you know i think i figure it
out

  how inquires rivers

  well remember captain kidd tells
us he and his pals come back as ghosts
by special permission from their pal
below they are going to find this
treasure and then take it back and di-
vide it up

  right

  only they double-cross their pal
below

  also right

  so he double-crosses them he
makes the storm come up and gets the
treasure to drop in the water also he
probably helps me knock those three
thugs back into the sea

  but who is he

  who else could he be but davy
jones himself i decide the pal of
pirates you know a guy with lots of
treasure at the bottom of the sea but
one who wants more and seeing as
how our three freebooters get buried at
sea he can raise them up again also
he can pull them down which he
does

  so he raises a storm eh says old
man rivers

  absolutely he must know the pi-
rates secret - because without the
storm i couldnt knock them over-
board anyhow its all over the
treasure is now where it belongs-in
davy jones locker

		jjc jc

t efty feep shrugged and stood up

is it not a misfortune he

asked

  you mean your not drowning your-
self after all

  no-i mean losing the treasure


fantastic adventures

  right but lefty one thing i
dont understand

  yes

  well you say you knocked all three
of these pirate ghosts overboard with
one blow i agree it could be done
with a plank but i dont see why those
tough guys didnt resist you why
didnt they put up a fight

  feep winked thats where davy
jones must help me he explained
because he knows the pirates secret
they are ghosts and have not sailed the
seas in hundreds of years so he merely

sends the storm and they cannot fight
me then

  why couldnt captain kidd and his
buccaneers fight you in that storm i
persisted

  because they are not used to storms
any more feep told me those pi-
rates are utterly helpless when i at-
tack them

  why i yelled

  lefty feep looked me square in the
eye without a blush

  sea-sickness he whispered

scientists produce last element

out of the entire  elements to be found
in the chemists periodic table only one
number  has been able to remain hid-
den all these years however it looks like it
too has been forced to give up its days of hid-
ing this element  has never been found in
nature and had never been produced artificially
until it made a brief appearance when other ele-
ments were bombarded with atomic fragments
whirled at them by the cyclotron at the uni-
versity of california the element still has not
been cured of its shyness for it remained only
long enough to record its appearance by means
of its radioactivity and then it disappeared

 the experiments were conducted by dr emilo
segre research associate in the radiation labor-
atory with the assistance of dr chien shiung-
wu a research fellow dr segre received the
rare earths that had been bombarded about 
months ago from dr luigi rolla a chemist

  element  is a member of the  rare earths
known to science it is assigned the atomic
number  since the nucleus or central core of
its atom has a positive charge that is  times
as great as that found in the nucleus of the
hydrogen atom this positive charge is neutral-
ized by  negative electrons that revolve about
its nucleus since each chemical element is
found in various forms known as isotopes it
is believed that one of these isotopes of element
 was what the bombardment had produced

  according to its position in the periodic table
scientists know that the atomic weight of ele-
ment  is about  and they are also able to
predict what its physical and chemical proper-
ties should be like but until they are able to
produce the element in a stable form so that it
can be measured and studied these predictions
have to remain in the realm of guesses as far
as scientific facts are concerned

using x-rays to increase food crops

dr lewis knudsen head of the hot-
any department at cornell university
has announced that x-rays can be used
to increase the yields of agricultural crops by
modifying the chloroplasts in the plants

  although the effects of x-rays on plants such
as causing changes in the shape of the plant or
the type of flower produced have been known
for some time this is the first case where the
chloroplasts the part of the plant which manu-
factures the foodstuffs have been changed

  moreover the experiments show that once the
x-rays have changed the chloroplasts so that
they produce more food the offspring of the
plants will grow with the new type chloroplast

to produce greater food yields

  dr knudsen is hopeful that this plan can
be adapted to the production of com wheat
oats and other crops that are especially useful
to man

  the plant experimented on was a fern x-rays
were concentrated on the spores holding the
chloroplasts which were later germinated in test
tubes many hundreds of thousands of plants
were treated but only eighty cases of altered
chloroplasts were obtained

  however the eighty cases after being isolated
under a microscope have already produced many
thousands of each type of plant to be used for
further study

vignettes of famous scientists

            by alexander blade ---

jfcavmefi

 he is regarded as the founder of the

 modern science of inorganic chemistry

 antoine laurent lavoisier the
founder of modern chemistry was born
in paris on august   his father
gave him an excellent education at the college
mazarin and he studied methematics and as-
tronomy with n l de lacaille chemistry with
the elder rouclle ancl botany with bernard de
jussieu in  he received a gold medal from
the academy of science for an essay on the
best means of lighting a large town in 
be was elected a member of the academy of
sciences in the following year he was ap-
pointed to the governmental position called a
farmer general of the revenue which paid a
good salary and enabled him to devote most of
his time to research work between  and
the year of his death lavoisier worked out the
principles forming lhe cornerstone of modern
chemistry and during this time held several im-
portant positions in  he was made director
of powder works and introduced valuable im-
provements in the manufacture of gunpowder
in  he was appointed one of the trustees
of the bank of discount and in  became
a member of the commission on weights and
measures taking a prominent part in the move-
ments which finally resulted in the establishment
of the metric system now universally employed

  in  lavoisier was commissary of the treas-
ury and published an interesting paper on the
economic condition of france the farmers-
general of the revenue were men of eminent so-
cial position and considerable wealth and in the
reign of terror their wealth became a source
of great danger to them in  dupin one
of the members of the convention accused them
of being enemies of their country lavoisier a
member of the aristocracy as well as the holder
of several position under the government be-
came obnoxious to the proletariat and on the
th of june  he and  of his companions
were guillotined at the place de la revolution
lavoisiers friends tried desperately to produce
an impression on the tribunal by describing his
scientific achievements the only reply was
we need no more scientists in france

  lavoisier is regarded as the founder of the
modern science of inorganic chemistry although
at the time the principle of the indestructibility
of matter-or the conservation of mass-had
not been grasped as a whole by scientists any
more than the similar principle of the indestructi-

bility of force-conservation of energy-yet he
became aware in his chemical work of the fact
that in all his experiments whatever changes
in kind occurred if all the products of these
changes were preserved their combined weight
exactly equaled that of the original substance
under investigation plus the weight of all re-
agents employed and retained and demonstrated
the fact by introducing the balance into his labor-
atory and the principles of mathematics as its
fundamental tool

  when iron mercury tin and other metals
were exposed to the action of the air their
weight increased the resulting earths con-
tained besides the matter of the metals other
matter and could naturally be split up again
into their constituents they were therefore
complex not simple substances the quantita-
tive method of lavoisier thus threw light on
the nature of various substances and led to a
clear definition of the idea of chemical elements
lavoisier also advanced a general theory of the
formation of chemical compounds according
to this theory all compounds have a binary con-
stitution a binary compound of the first order
is one made up of two elements a binary com-
pound of the second order is formed by the
union of two binary compounds of the first
order the acids formed by the union of sul-
phur nitrogen phosphorous and similar sub-
stances with oxygen are binary compounds of
the first order acids are neutralized by bases
with formation of salts therefore salts are bin-
ary compounds of the second order in subse-
quent times the binary theory proved inade-
quate and had to be abandoned however it
gave birth to a series of important results

  lavoisiers ideas when once accepted trans-
formed the crude chemistry oi the day into an
exact science and was quickly followed by the
development of a system of names to constantly
remind of the composition and properties of
compounds

  during his comparatively brie cavcer la-
voisier produced a large number of scientific
papers most of which were on chemical subjects

  in addition to his purely chemical work la-
voisier devoted considerable attention to physi-
cal projoienis especially those connected with
heat pie also worked at fermentation respira-
tion and animal heat looking upon the processes
concerned as essentially chemical in nature

          by elroy arno

        the willies were real jones found and
        worse yet he was doomed to become one

there wasnt anything very
breathtaking about willowby
jones in fact many people went
so far as to call him a jerk bernice
adams hadnt called him that but she
might as well have

  willowby stood very much alone in
the center of the office he picked up
bernices picture from his desk and

held it high above his head puckering
his lips horribly willowby let the pic-
ture fly with all his strength against
the far wall it showered glass on the
carpet

 damn

  utter horrible silence answered this
outburst almost at once willowby
jones realized that he was just as jeal-





fantastic adventures

ous as ever he walked toward the
coat room adjusted his brown tie and
felt his adams-apple working at terrific
speed

  there was a lump in his throat that
he couldnt work loose darkness was
already closing in around the office of
fox and laird advertising agency
wandering toward the elevator willow-
by knew how the fog horn beyond the
pier felt sending its bellow of pain in
through the open window

  bernice adams was very young ex-
ceptionally sweet and willowby had
thought until tonight in love with him
if he just hadnt waited for her to leave
the office willowby would have been
a happy man had he not tired of waiting
at the parking lot and returned to the
office in search of bernice

  it had all happened with a suddeness
that left him gasping he had gone in
quite softly trying not to disturb those
who were still working then turning
from the door his eyes glued themselves
on the opaque window of mr foxs
office he saw two clear shadows
standing close to each other he knew
the slim shapely one belonged to ber-
nice and that she was lifting a tall glass
of something to her lips her laughter
rang out clearly and the man who drank
with her chuckled willowby didnt
know who the fellow was and although
they didnt actually embrace he was
sure they would very soon

  wtillowby crept softly towards the
mens wash room and with the door
open just a crack waited until bernice
and jimmy bauker came out together
willowby decided on the spot that to
murder bauker would be a perfectly
normal action on his part

  jimmy bauker poised and polished
was the youthful owner of the towns
biggest whiskey plant tall and sought
after by women bauker had points that
willowby could never hope to acquire

even with the wildest stretch of imagi-
nation

  jimmy bauker had placed a healthy
advertising contract with fox and laird
and now it was pretty ol ious why he
had done it at least clear enough to
burn willowby to the depths of his soul

  they had hurried out and wtilowby
stayed in his hiding place for a long
time after the glass door closed damn
bauker and his money they could
get someone else to do that full page
layout for bauker whiskey he wil-
lowby was through for all time he
was thoroughly miserable and fed up
with the whole business

uter drive was a mass of traf-
fic it hesitated plunged ahead
through gaps in itself and then stalled
to wait for another chance to spring
willowby jones drove carefully peer-
ing short sightedly through the wind-
shield at wilson avenue it was im-
possible to see more than a few feet
ahead

  suddenly the car hit something wi i
a sickening thump he felt two sharp
bumps under the wheels and his throat
was suddenly dry and raspy he drew
the car in toward the curb and was out
of it in a reluctant dash

  an incredulous look of disbelief
fanned his thin face there was no
body in sight traffic rolled along as
usual and the cop on the corner didnt
even look around

  puzzled but greatly relieved willow-
by returned to the wheel and drew out
a large clean handkerchief his face
was damp and sticky at a much re-
duced rate of speed he managed to
reach the acorn arms apartment hotel
and park the car in the garage

  then it occurred to willowby that a
hit-and-run driver was the lowest type
of person imaginable wtiat would he
do if the morning papers carried accu-
jones gets the willies



sations against him he fumbled for
his key and entered the apartment feel-
ing very ill sitting down he came face
to face with the full length mirror in
the bathroom a very pale young man
of twenty-six years stared at him guil-
tily he was dressed in a neat if
slightly damp brown suit white shirt
and brown tie there was an undigni-
fied wavering expression on his face
the look of a hunted man

  the bottle of bauker whiskey had
been on the kitchen shelf for months
willowby suspected little of its power
but suddenly felt in need of healing
he hated to drink anything with the
bauker label on it but it was whiskey
and he needed something in a hurry
how such a cool looking amber fluid
could possess the double-barreled kick
of a mule willowby never quite found
out the first gulp went down with a
fierce smoothness that silenced his
adams-apple for all time

  his face twisted into an expression
of sneering disdain for anyone who
bragged of taking their whiskey
straight after the third drink it was
too late to pause for reconsideration

  willowbys fingers closed over the
neck of the bottle and drained it of
every sparkle

  suddenly the mirror looked straight
at him and said in a lisping voice

  i wouldnt do that if i wath you

vxtllowby dropped the bottle
and stared at himself in dismay
but you are me he said and the
humor of the situation pleased him ill
do as i damned please

  another voice came from his right
elbow it was rather nasty he thought

  he said he wouldnt do it and he
means it 

  willowby jerked his body around so
suddenly that the bottle toppled from
his lap and hit the floor with a crash

  there he shouted now damn
you look what youve done

  he arose unsteadily and staggered to-
ward the mirror something pushed him
back against the cushions and his head
dropped to one side willowby felt
very sick

  someone or something lisped in his
ear

  get hold of yourthelf joneth wte
havent got all night

  right the sharp voice sliced in
he said get hold of yourself

  willowby cocked one eye open wisely
and studied the room he wiped a damp
hand across his face something was
very wrong at the acorn arms and he
suspected he was it

  please he begged the mirror
stare at me like a dope if you must
but dont talk i cant stand it
there was a dry chuckle from the
davenport a match flared in mid air
touched the tip of a floating cigarette
and passed to another a few feet away
the cigarettes started to puff on them-
selves contentedly willowby stared at
the mirror and the image of himself
stared back pop-eyed with fright his
eyes were bloodshot and his mouth
hinged wide open

  thith can be very painful the
lispy voice said suddenly we muth
convinth him at oneth

  very painful sharp agreed how
shall we do it

  willowby was on his feet again

  do what he shouted im all
right i got the willies thats all i
cant take my whiskey im-im not
the drinking  

  his voice trailed off helplessly
why am i talking he groaned
youre talking with uth lispy an-
swered coolly go on were inter-
ethed

  yea sharp staccatoed were in-
terested


fantastic adventures

  but it doesnt make sense

  yet in spite of his growing head the
whole thing did make sense there
were two voices in the room and two
smoking cigarettes

  who are you who where and for
gods sake how

  we are the willies sharp ex-
plained we are what you got for
drinking

  and we got a bargain to make
lispy added softly

  willowby tried to convince himself
that he was only drunk filthy drunk

  it didnt work whoever the willies
were they were vefy much with him
he decided he didnt like them

  go on willowby begged whats
the bargain

  he retreated slowly toward the false
safety of the bathroom door

  look here old man lispy became
patronizingly sweet tongued we have
no quarrel with you ith about our
brother you ran over him thith after-
noon you know

yytllowbys body jerked up-
right and his brain started to
whirl about at an amazing speed so
that was it he tried to escape but
firm invisible hands grasped his shoul-
ders

  i didnt see   he stammered
and was silent

  this explained the sudden collision
on wilson avenue the feeling that he
had hit something but how could any-
one prove   

  dont be frightened joneth lispy
begged we didnt like our brother
very well anyhow were glad you hit
him ith juth that hith death bringth
up complicationth

 yeh a broad heavy hand
swooped down and collapsed willow-
bys shoulder his death brings up
complications

  i should say so  willowby whis-
pered ive never killed a-a man be-
fore

  he started to fold up and felt them
holding him on his feet once more in
the chair he sat very still stretching
out as comfortably as he could he
watched the cigarettes with slitted eyes
a wet towel floated from the bath room
and wrapped itself around his feverish
head a tall glass of water drifted in
from the kitchen and stopped at his
lips he gulped feebly and felt a little
better closing his eyes tightly willow-
by felt the room go around at high
speed he opened them again wonder-
ing dully how long the cigarettes could
burn before blistering those invisible
fingertips

  please he said im in no con-
dition for this kind of thing let me in
on the joke will you fellows

  thith lispy assured him in a
shocked voice ith no joke were
short a man now and you have to take
over thith job

  willowby decided to humor them
his stomach cooled off a little and he
sat upright his head wasnt quite so
fogged

  ill gladly pay my debt he shud-
dered i didnt mean to run over your
brother

  from the position of lispys cigar-
ette he knew the willie was nodding in
agreement the stub tossed itself into
an ash tray and the other followed

  youre entirely right lispy said
he didnt play fair he could have
made himthelf vithible before crothing
the threet

  yup sharp chuckled he didnt
play according to hoyle but that dont
cut no ice lets get out of here
dont hurry willowby said and
arose to hold the door open im a
late sitter take your time

  youre not sitting tonight  sharp
jones gets the willies



said quickly youre going with us
willowby felt himself propelled
speedily across the room toward the
closet

  get your coat lispy ordered ith
a methy night and you might catch
cold

  but i dont feel well willowby
protested id rather stay in

  his arms jerked back and the brown
coat slipped over his shoulders his
hat flipped to his head and slipped down
to a devil-may-care angle

  i cant go out looking like this he
protested these clothes look terri-
ble wet you know

  you wont care how you look with
us sharp assured him

i really havent a place in the world
to go willowby protested weakly
im not the type to run about a lot
the room was very silent for a mo-
ment lispy chuckled

  i dont gueth youve ever had the
willieth have you

  willowby shuddered

  did i get you from drinking that
terrible stuff in the bottle

  sharp snorted angrily

  awful stuff why what would we
do if no one ever drank after a few
highballs youll find we aint half bad
to get along with

yrlllowby felt himself propelled
toward the lobby and into the
street with the willies assistance he
staggered toward sheridan road wil-
lowby had trouble keeping his feet un-
der him bauker whiskey was rough
stuff he had trouble keeping himself
in the center of the sidewalk although
lispy and sharp had remained silent
since they left the building their pres-
ence was very evident when willowby
managed to walk more than three steps
in a straight line they would bump him
about until he sprawled full length on

the cement his hat popped off at the
most unexpected places and sharps
foot tangled with his knees until tears
sprang into willowbys eyes people
were staring but it was useless to pro-
test if he tried to plead with the wil-
lies onlookers would be even more apt
to wonder at his sanity

  somehow they reached the end of the
street and willowby found himself
pushed quickly to the side of a waiting
bus

  on with you sharp whispered
hoarsely dont try to give us the
slip

  willowby grabbed the upright bar at
the bus door and felt an invisible arm
around his waist before he could get
a firm grip the arm sent him spinning
full length on the floor at the same
time his coat flew open and the neck-
tie jerked tight against his adanrs-
apple

  ouch willowby yelped

  on your feet bub the bus driver
said this aint any place to take the
cure

  a very fat lady had settled in the
cushions beside willowbys resting
place on the floor she grasped her
ribs suddenly and with a face red with
horror turned on him

  you worm pinch a lady will you

  her broad palm came down with a
loud smack on his cheek

  sharp and lispy were on the job
when willowby felt himself winking at
the blonde across the aisle he knew that
lispys thumb against his eyeball was
doing the trick yet he managed to
live through this nightmare and find
his way out of the bus a bit south of
madison street

  where-where do i go now he
asked helplessly i dont really think
this is necessary

  sharp standing close to him in the
rain laughed aloud


fantastic adventures

  you dont think its necessary do
you his voice was cold and wicked
well youre gonna get drunk and
i mean swimming drunk youre gonna
get drunk and have fun

  but this is the first time ive ever
touched intoxicating beverages wil-
lowby protested i really dont like
them at all

  you will lispy said softy and
we know juth the plathe to learn come
with us

  a sudden kick in the seat of the
pants a jerk on his necktie and willow-
by jones was off on a wild gallop down
michigan avenue he crossed the
street with a howl and a whoop the
necktie still standing out stiffly before
him held by sharps willing hand
willowby jones was well on the way to
experiencing his first drunken spree

t night-owl was a warm smoky
little place on wabash where
friends met after work until it took on
a personality of its own at eleven
oclock willowby jones a shadow of
his former quiet self flew like a projec-
tile through the open door and sat down
on a bar stool

  about to taste his tenth drink of the
evening he realized suddenly that the
glass was doing strange things sharp
had picked it up from the bar and it
hung at his lips in mid-air the bar-
tender a washed-out little man with
flappy ears saw the glass hanging with-
out support he jumped forward try-
ing to catch it willowby realizing that
he was again being made a fool of
knocked it from sharps fingers and the
glass shattered on the floor at his feet
the man with the flappy ears sighed
turned crimson around the neck and
walked quickly away

  no more drinks tonight he mut-
tered darkly getting the willies
again

  then willowby jones saw something
that made him very glad that he was
drunk something that would have
made the sober willowby a demon from
hell jimmy bauker tall and darkly
handsome in a blue topcoat came
through the door bernice adams was
walking close to him her arm in his
willowby wanted to stand up and fight
at once somehow his legs failed to
respond and he knew the willies were
holding him tightly around the waist

  willowby watched the smiling cou-
ple as they passed and chose a booth
on the far side of the room his pres-
ence had gone unnoticed bernice
small and lovely was staring up at bau-
ker with what willowby chose to call
moon eyes there was a sort of smooth
warmth about her slim body that
started willowbys heart flaming all
over again a sucker could tell that
bauker admired those long-lashed blue
eyes the blue-black hair that slipped
down in careful curls against her white
neck it hurt even worse to realize that
he willowby had never even seen the
revealing little dress that she wore to-
night he had never seen her so alive
and exciting

  anchored to the tall fascination that
was jimmy bauker bernice sat down
gracefully in the secluded booth

  willowby realized that he must ap-
proach the couple coolly and in a dis-
interested manner this sounded quite
simple and without the assistance of the
willies he might make the trip safely
perhaps if he pleaded with them

  look fellows he said thats
my girl give me a break will you i
cant keep up this business of being
pushed around all night

  the bartender ears redder than ever
leaned toward him over the bar

  look buddy he pleaded i
dont like to see a guy get to talking
to himself see you better go home
jones gets the willies



and sober up 

  willowby wanted to hide his embar-
rassment at being caught talking to no
one it didnt work one of the willies
sent a thick finger digging into his ribs

  ouch willowby shouted lay
off will you

  the bartender shook his head sadly

  okay-okay he said but dont
say i didnt  

  his voice faded as he walked away

comehow willowby staggered to
his feet neatly dodged sharps fifth
attempt to trip him and swayed toward
the booth where bernice and jimmy
bauker were sipping their drinks he
approached warily knowing by this
time just about when the willies would
again attempt to sabotage his progress
he reached the table and bracing both
arms firmly against it leaned forward
over the surprised couple

  willowby bernice looked up at
him a welcome smile on her lips im
so glad you found us

  bauker stood up

  glad to see you jones he pushed a
friendly hand forward sit down old
man and join us the drinks are on
me

  willowby paused uncertainly felt
sharps hand against his back and
dropped to bernices side just as the
willie applied pressure

  im glad too he said in a slightly
off-key voice and that makes everyone
glad youre glad you got my girl
shes glad shes got you and me-im
glad because i got the willies

  bernice laughed and to willowby
jones it was pure sarcasm at his condi-
tion n

   augh over my coffin he urged
sadly

  wfllowbys hat which he had over-
looked slipped from his head suddenly
and settled down gently on the table

lispy was on the job

  bauker chuckled

  quite a trick he said do it
again will you

  willowby didnt appreciate the sound
of baukers chuckle the world seemed
upside down right now and willowby
felt as though he was clinging to the
under side with both feet in the air
through the mist of floating images he
could make out six baukers and four
bernices all leering at him as though
he were a one-man sideshow

  i-i guess i wont stay he man-
aged to murmur i just happened 
before he could finish the hat lifted
itself from the table floated up and
settled on his head once more then
it arose once more circled the table
and dropped on baukers smoothly
combed top deck baukers mouth
dropped open at a wide angle

  why jones youre a miracle man
he said in admiration i didnt real-
ize that such a trick could be done
hidden strings i suppose

yyillowby s lips quivered visibly
and the table lurched almost out
from under him his stomach felt as
though it had turned over and started
to function backward

its-its nothing much he mum-
bled modestly i practice at home
bernice had been silent admiring him
with eyes that grew three shades more
blue with pride

  how can you say that she de-
manded why-jimmy and i hadnt
thought you   

  so it was jimmy already

  willowby stood up as quickly as the
invisible men on his shoulders would
let him grabbed his hat from baukers
head and slammed it down on his own

  i had no intention of disturbing
you he growled just go ahead and
have a good time ill have to be  


fantastic adventures

  say bauker protested sit down
again jones i want to see more of
those wonderful tricks

  willowby opened his mouth to pour
out words of bitterness he tried to
speak but invisible fingers clamped
over his lips instead of his own voice
sharps came from the thin air behind
bauker

  magic say i can do that stuff all
night born in me

  bernices pretty lips popped open in
surprise and bauker grinned happily

  why the mans a genius he said
he not only does magic but hes an
expert ventriloquist as well

  im not willowby said flatly
thats just-just   

  his arms jerked backward and he
slipped across the smooth floor the
willies were removing him bodily from
the night owl removing him under
strenuous objection they released
him a few feet from the table and he
stood very still a sickly grin across
his face

  good night he said thickly ill
be seeing you

  the couple at the table were much
too occupied with new events at hand
to hear him bernices glass went into
the air suddenly took a tail spin and
crashed baukers arms jerked sky-
ward and his coat slipped away from
him it floated across the room and
settled down on a waiters head the
waiter intent on an armload of drinks
ducked wildly and went to the floor in
a crash he came to his feet slowly
holding baukers coat aloft in holy rev-
erence

  thats the oddest thing i ever saw
the waiter said it just flew across the
room at me

  yeth it wath odd wathunt it
a lisping voice agreed at his shoulder
it muth have grown wings

  i cant understand   the

waiter turned toward the owner of the
sympathetic voice and suddenly real-
ized that he was talking to no one he
turned away quickly eyes glazed with
horror and sought the safety of the bar

  when jimmy bauker had once more
retrieved his coat and returned to the
booth willowby jones was not in sight
willowby realized the time had come
for retreat his last act was the end
any relationship he may have had with
bernice and the fox and laird adver-
tising agency had ended abruptly

ytllowby was miserable why
he had come to the office of fox
and laird was a mystery to him after
the experience he had undergone at the
night owl he felt like seeking out the
quietest place in the world the office
at three in the morning was just that
opening the door softly he held it while
the ever present lipsy and sharp fol-
lowed him inside the main lounge
was a symphony of black and gray
hastening across it he found his desk
and turned on the low light over it
with his head down on the drawing
board willowby tried to sleep his
head felt very large and like a pumpkin
complete with triangle eyes

  a rotten trick thats what it was
he said loudly

  the creaking floor told him that the
willies were close to him listening

  thath gratitude for you lispy
protested take a man out and teach
him the ropeth and thath what we get

  yeah sharp sounded almost de-
jected a good willie has no cooper-
ation these days im all for the good
old days when we didnt know the
meaning of a bromo with his girl
stepping out on him whats he got to
lose

  willowby thought of that for a long
time it was true that bernice had
played a rotten trick on him willowby



fantastic adventures

searched for a pen and with it in his
hand he felt better he found a clean
sheet of paper perhaps a sketch or
two would help clear out his head he
started to draw crooked meaningless
lines on the papers clean surface

  gradually his interest in the drawing
grew something of the misery in his
heart came out of that pen point work-
ing feverishly willowby changed pens
green blue yellow the colors were
brutal and wild he drew across the
paper all the hate and misery that was
in his soul he sketched the willies as
he pictured them with long pointed
ears and wild grins he was rewarded
by the silence about him and their sud-
den gasps of surprise

  how does he know what we look
like sharp whispered

  willowby didnt answer he drew
himself bent over and dejected at his
desk in the drawing the willies were
pounding and torturing his miserable
body as they had done all night when
he finished he threw the pen across the
office and heard it hit the wall

  willowby felt much better

  say sharp said suddenly this
isnt getting us anywhere i left a
couple more bottles at the apartment
lets go back and you kill em

  willowby arose reluctantly he de-
cided it was no use to fight the willies
they seemed to do as they pleased
with him locking the door by force
of habit he wandered out into the
street footsteps close behind him on
the wet pavement told him the willies
were close

xillowby spent eight tossing
pillow wrinkling hours in bed
when he awakened someone was shak-
ing his shoulders and his head throbbed
painfully

  time to wake up it was sharps
voice eager and friendly got to

have another drink before last nights
wear off cant be sobering up this
early in the game

  willowby felt himself being lifted
up not too gently and a full glass of
whisky danced before his lips he
drank quickly and the empty glass flew
away toward the kitchen

  thath a good boy lispy hadnt
deserted him youll feel better al-
moth anytime now

  willowby felt a strange suspicion
arising in his mind

  how long do i keep drinking this
stuff he asked quietly

  lispy chuckled

 hey he shouted toward the
kitchen joneth wanth to know how
long doth he have to drink

  sharps voice responded lear ad
ugly

  ill be right back with more he
answered three more bottles found
their way in last night

  lispy chuckled again and it was
downright nasty

good he said approvingly
thereth more where that came from
willowby sat up adjusted the pil-
lows and tried to reason things out

  it seems to me he said aloud i
ought to sober up pretty soon
lispys voice was filled with alarm
oh no you mustnt  

  but why not willowby protested
i just cant stay in bed and drink
forever

  another glass was on its way across
the room

  and why not sharp had heard
his protest its been done before
keep quiet lispy begged if
he  

  there was a sudden loud crack of
palm against cheek

  thay lispy howled you didnt
have to hit me   

  opinions on that differ sharp an-
jones gets the willies



swered bitterly dont go giving him
ideas

xtllowbys eyes narrowed and
a thought planted itself slowly in
his brain there was something fishy
here could it be these two were afraid
he would sober up would it make
a difference

  youre afraid of something he
said slowly i believe you want to kill
me with that stuff

  silence for an instant then sharp
said in a fatherly voice

  why jones how can you think such
a thing we made a man out of you
overnight we can have lots more
fun

  of courth lispy chimed in here
-take another thip

  a full glass of bauker whiskey wav-
ered doubtfully at willowbys mouth
for an instant he weakened and then
his thin lips closed in a determined
line

  nolhe said

  aw just a little sip wont hurt
sharp pleaded

  try it lispy begged juth for
old timeth thake

  no willowby said again ive
had enough i get in trouble when i
drink

  sharp steadied the glass and put it
down on the bed table

  i can see he said wickedly that
we are going to have trouble

  youve got to sober up willowbys
inner man said they didnt bother
you before and perhaps they cant
when you dont drink

  he threw the bed covers back care-
fully and pushed bare feet over the
edge of the bed

  thats the spirit sharp said ap-
provingly get up and stagger around
a bit youll feel more thirsty in a
minute

  willing arms helped willowby to his
feet they were close to the bathroom
door

  nowi the inner man yelped give
em a push and you can make it

 willowby pushed with all his
strength heard surprised grunts as the
willies toppled backward and dashed
quickly toward the open door his
bare feet pattered on the cold tile and
he slammed the door closed behind him

  he snapped the bolt into place and
leaned against the door with his hand
on his forehead shooting pains played
up and down his back and his head
whirled outside there was a great
commotion sharp was pounding on
the door

  hey open up in there do you
hear open up before i pound the
door down

ytllowby staggered across the
floor and pushed a finger down his
throat shooting stars tore through his
head and he gave everything he had
to the effort the door started to bend
under the combined weight of lispy
and sharp

  willowby sat down he was still
sick but bauker whiskey had lost its
power the pounding on the door
stopped

  lispys voice came to him pleading
and far away

  joneth pleath let uth in weve got
a drink for you a nice cool one

  go away willowby said

  he held his head under the cold
water tap and then under the shower
his body started to awaken and feel
alive again sharps voice came no
more but lispy was still trying

  youll be thorry joneth

  nuts willowby shouted youre
going for good ill never drink again

  youll mith uth lispy pleaded

  yeah willowby agreed like


fantastic adventures

an earthquake

  it was better now better until he
suddenly remembered bis standing with
bernice jimmy bauker and fox and
laird willowby jones sober again
and tired of life would hold no place
of love in the heart of his associates
he hoped that jimmy bauker had for-
given and that for bernices sake the
contract had not been cancelled he
hoped she would be very happy with
the young whiskey millionaire

  if nothing else willowby was a gen-
tleman at heart now that his weaker
self had been conquered he must re-
turn to fox and laird tell them that
he was a heel and take his punishment

  ime had played a trick on wil-
lowby he had thought that only
the night before his evening with sharp
and lispy had been a reality now as
he entered the main floor of the majes-
tic building the calendar on the infor-
mation desk told him that the shock of
whiskey had done strange things to
his body bernice and jimmy bauker
had long since left the night owl club
in fact he clearly remembered the night
as being monday it was still mon-
day but the clock had made fourteen
complete turns since willowby had first
entered the net of his downfall for a
time he stood very quietly in the lobby

  he stared at the calendar with unbe-
lieving eyes it never lied a week
had passed and history had been made
while he willowby jones had floun-
dered in a cesspool of drink when at
last he entered the office of fox and
laird it was with narrowed eyes and
bowed head he felt much like a small
pup who had been whipped and stoned
until his head would never rise again

  willowby crossed the office side-
stepped several desks and sat down at
his own

  willowby where have you been

  the voice was glad and musical a
soft hand touched his arm and he
looked up into bernice adams cool
blue eyes he saw love and concern
for him in them

 why-i-i  something
choked his throat and he couldnt talk
willowby had expected the walls to
crush him and here instead was glad-
ness at his returning

  just you never mind bernice bent
over his shoulder and planted a kiss on
his cheek mr fox has been waiting
for you to come in

  yes willowby answered uncer-
tainly i sort of thought he might be
oh its wonderful willowby
just wonderful i

  yes willowby remembered the
jumping hat and the flying coat but
i guess i couldnt do it again

  he felt himself being tugged gently
across the office toward foxs office
it was through these same opaque win-
dows that he had first seen bauker and
bernice together happy in each others
company

  a returning hunger for her hurt him
deep inside he thought of jimmy
bauker and how fortunate the man was
to have a girl like bernice adams
still she had kissed him and that was
something

jytr fox was talking as they en-
tered his voice dominated the
room mr fox and his thunderous
voice had been dominating rooms
empty and full for twenty years

  i tell you bauker its the greatest
thing ive ever seen

  his voice broke off suddenly as wil-
lowby and bernice entered

  jones good lord man where
have you been weve been look-
ing   

  willowby stood meekly by the door
with his hand in bernices fingers tall
jones gets the willies

handsome jimmy bauker was sitting on
the far side of the desk he eyed
bauker coolly

  ive been home he answered
home fox seemed thunderstruck
by gad bauker thats the only
place we didnt think to look for him
jimmy bauker leaned forward in his
chair chuckled and stood up his arm
was outstretched

  jones he was trying hard to look
business like congratulations old
man its the finest thing ive ever
seen

  i guess that i can only do magic
when im drunk willowby confessed
im-im not really very good at it
jimmy bauker looked puzzled then
he started to pump willowbys hand
vigorously

oh that i wasnt referring to
that act you put on at the night owl
oh willowby was at sea again
wondering just what bauker was talk-
ing about i thought 

  now-dont get me wrong bauker
begged that business of playing the
drunk was clever and the magic was
like nothing ive ever seen before i
could appreciate what you were trying
to illustrate couldnt i bernice
willowby waited not at all sure of
what he should say next bernice
snuggled close to his side

  the poor boy has been ill for a
week mr fox please show him the
advertisement im sure hell feel much
better

  fox seemed like a man who just re-
membered what he came for

 why of course he fumbled
about the pile of papers on his desk
and brought out a new copy of colliers
its right here on the inner front
cover

ytllowby walked across the
room like a man in a confusing

dream and stared wide-eyed at the
full page ad

  there at the top was a reproduction
of the ink drawing he had made that
horrible night with the willies it
showed himself willowby leaning
across his desk and the pictures radi-
ated his headache over his shoulders
stared the willies lispy and sharp
the whole thing was so terrible that it
brought back memories that were bet-
ter forgotten under his pictures in
very black type was the blurb
bauker whiskey will never
do this to you
there was a lot of print about it be-
ing a time of war and a time for safe
drinking bauker whiskey was made
for appreciative people who knew
enough not to sabotage their brains with
whiskey when they were needed on the
job

  one of the finest pieces of art ive
ever seen bauker was saying that
picture has sold an extra five thousand
gallons of our stuff in three days
willowby knew he was supposed to
say something but the small photograph
at the bottom of the page caught his
attention it was taken in foxs of-
fice bernice and jimmy were lifting
full glasses to their lips smiles adorned
their faces and the caption read
bauker whiskey made for better and
more moderate friendship

  moderate willowby mumbled
thats the most wonderful word in the
world

  right bauker agreed warmly
that shot of bernice and myself gets
across the friendly spirit but for
heavens sake man dont be so modest
about your own work you must have
created it in a moment of artistic
frenzy its grand stuff

  willowby turned away from the
opened magazine slowly he took ber-
nice firmly in his arms and kissed her


fantastic adventures

lips he wanted to kiss bauker and
fox in the manner he had seen a
french army officer kiss the cheeks of
his men instead he grasped baukers
hand firmly and nearly pumped it loose
from his shoulder

  i guess that i was in sort of a
frenzy when i did that job willowby
admitted anyhow i dont think ill
ever do another one under the same
conditions

 one is enough mr fox was

beaming upon him like a very proud
parent willowby therell be a real
reward in this for you i can appre-
ciate a sober industrious man like
yourself were they all as temperate
as yourself im sure both the company
and their wives would be very grate-
ful

  amen willowby whispered under
his breath and looked longingly toward
bernice

fantastic-but true

        by alex waman

           facts such as these prove that fan-
           tasy is not confined only to fiction

apples cause rose leaves to fall

whenever industry is stuck on a
problem it is usually up to the scien-
tists to come to their rescue shippers
of field-grown rose bushes in the west have had
the problem of how to remove the leaves from
the bushes before shipment this is necessary
to cut down water loss in the bushes through
evaporation while in transit the old process
was to pluck the leaves by hand since any ma-
chine method would destroy the bushes entirely
this method however was tedious as well as
expensive and workers were continually com-
plaining about the sharp thorns

  j a milbroth elmer hansen and henry
hartman discovered at oregon state college a
method of making bushes shed their leaves by
themselves in a few days if the bushes are
placed in a tightly closed room at a moderate
temperature with one bushel of apples for every
three hundred to four hundred cubic feet of
space they can be made to shed their leaves in
about four days

  the apples can produce this result because
they give off a small quantity of ethylene a
common constituent of natural gas although
the fact that ethylene can remove the foliage
from a plant has long been known this is the
first case where it has been put to a practical
use this method of preparing rose bushes for
shipment is now in wide use

  

           tin saver
 i he present shortage of tin has forced in-
dustry to look around for methods of doing
without the vital metal one of the recent dis-
coveries was made by the merrimac division of
monsanto chemical company which announced
that its new organic chemical will save many
tons of tin each year

  the chemical is known as d p solution and
if it is added in small amounts to clear lacquers
alcoholic shellacs and such nitrocellulose solu-
tions as collodion and pyroxylin it will prevent
these substances from corroding iron and thus
they can be shipped in ordinary steel containers
instead of the tin-lined ones that had to be
used prior to the discovery of the chemical
moreover the new method is much cheaper than
the use of tin-lined containers and this will
replace the old method even after the war when
tin will again be plentiful

	 

increasing efficiency of autos

ratent number  has recently been
 awarded to edward b peck of elizabeth
and peter j gaylor of new jersey covering
their process to reduce the carbon accumulation
in auto engines by using zinc oxide

  when gasoline explodes in the cylinders of an
internal combustion engine carbon is deposited
in the cylinder head and valves this deposit
reduces the efficiency of the engine and must
be removed the present method of removing
the deposit is by hand but this will soon be
changed

  the inventors have discovered that by cover-
ing with zinc oxide the engine parts that become
coated with carbon while the engine is in opera-
tion the carbon formation can be reduced to
a small fraction of its present rate there are
several methods of applying the zinc oxide zinc
may be electroplated on the parts where carbon
forms on the parts and can be sprayed with
vapors of metallic zinc the third method con-
sists of galvanizing the parts by a treatment
with molten zinc in all three methods an oxi-
dizing agent is used to change the zinc into zinc
oxide

	 

better process to deodorize
gasoline

xxthen gasoline is first refined from oil it
  contains certain sulphur compounds known
as mercaptans which give it a very unpleasant
odor very similar to the odor of a skunk for
many years the industry has been using a rather
expensive but effective process to deodorize the
gasoline as much as possible by treatment the
mercaptans are changed into sulphur compounds

without an odor but they have always remained
in the gasoline by remaining in the gasoline
the sulphur compounds acted on the tetraethyl
lead that was added to the gasoline and reduced
its effectiveness in increasing the octane rating of
the gasoline

  however just recently a new method has been
introduced which not only removes the distaste-
ful odor but also raises its octane number this
new method works on the mercaptans and dis-
solves them out of the gasoline completely thus
the gas requires less ethyl to raise the octane
rating to the desired standard

the glorious hollywood sun that
slanted through the windows of
the writers building on the apex
films lot did not particularly impress
laird baxter for that young man was
sound asleep  the leather office sofa
which had been thoughtfully provided
by studio heads for exhausted genius

laird baxter was not exhausted he
had slept soundly the night before and

he had done nothing since arriving at
the studio except open his mail which
had consisted of several duns and a curt
note from a second cousin demanding
a loan of five hundred dollars

  these he had consigned to the waste-
basket without delay and then having
completed his chores for the day he
stretched his lean frame out on the sofa
tipped a hat over his eyes and went

quietly to sleep

  he was still sleeping when his office
boy entered sometime around eleven in
the morning

  hey boss the boys brassy shout
was a blend of sarcastic deference and
envy old w w wants to see you
his secretary sent me over here to get
you

  laird baxter lifted the hat from his
face and peered with dislike at the
scrawny youth standing in the doorway

  go away he said he put the hat
back over his face and closed his eyes

  im just telling you thats all
theres a big conference going on over
there and he wants you to come right
over

  i am resting lairds voice was
muffled behind the hand i am restock-
ing my depleted emotional reservoirs
begone

  all right im going the office boy
said but if anybody asks me youre
crazy

  no one is liable to ask you laird
said so dont let it get you down
he took the hat away from his face
again and studied the youth in the door-
way and why he said squinting
would you be so quick to tell this hypo-
thetical questioner that i am a mental
case

  well gee gloria turner is over
there in w ws office anybody whod
pass up the chance to view that blonde
blitzkrieg at close range must be nuts

  laird baxter got to his feet with sus-
picious haste he adjusted his tie and
smoothed his black rumpled hair with
both hands

  why didnt you say so he asked
the grinning office boy youve been
around this screwy joint long enough to
realize the importance of coming to the
point immediately

  but you said-

  please dont quote me laird said

sternly the quickest way to make a
fool of a man is to quote him verbatim

  yes sir then ill tell w ws secre-
tary youre coming

  laird put his hat on and strode to
the door

  never mind ill tell him myself he
said and left

  as he hurried across the wide sun-
splashed lot that separated the execu-
tive buildings from those of the poor
peons of the writing trade his thoughts
were of gloria turner and very pleas-
ant thoughts they were

  laird baxter was not just another of
the hollywood wolves in padded sports
coats who began drooling at the sight
of the comely wenches who were scat-
tered so profusely and delightfully
about the magic city of celluloid he
was different

  his interest in gloria turner al-
though he had only met her once or
twice was the real thing complete with
dreams of an ivy-trellised bungalow
for two and a crib for one

  he realized that he was a sap for
kidding himself along that way but
there didnt seem to be anything to do
about it in an environment where love
was as outdated and old fashioned as
the silent screen laird baxter found
himself not only in love but in love in
a starry-eyed adolescent sort of way
that was almost embarrassing

lte entered the portals of the
executives building and stopped at
the receptionists desk in the vast palm-
dotted lobby

  the receptionist a pretty girl who
had come to hollywood three years ago
because her high school dramatic coach
thought she had something smiled at
him

  go right in mr baxter she said
theyre expecting you

  thanks he said and where are
trail of the magic slippers



these assorted fruits and nuts as-
sembled

  in w ws office

  laird bowed chivalrously to the girl
and proceeded down a wide corridor
that led to a vast mohagony door which
bore in letters of solid gold the name of
w w winterbloom

  his knock was answered by a full-
throated bellow from beyond the door
which could have been interpreted a
dozen ways laird opened the door
and stepped into an office which might
have doubled in size for a skating rink
and which was cloudy with layers of
swirling smoke and hot air

  through the fog banks of smoke he
made out w w winterbloom standing
in front of his dramatically oversized
ebony desk with a smile of welcome on
his round wrinkled face

  it is so nice to see you my boy he
beamed we were just talking about
you

  laird glanced around at the assem-
bled group of writers directors and
studio press agents and a cynical grin
touched his face

  really nobody went so far as to
say something good about me did
they

  ah my boy w w chortled al-
ways quick with the joking arent you
but today we got problems to settle and
the joking must wait for a while this
is not the time for procrastificration

  laird raised a polite eyebrow

  again please

  w w waved a pudgy hand in a ges-
ture of irritation

  you know the word i am always
using in times like this he said frown-
ing

  oh yes laird nodded that one
procrastination

  thats it ww winterbloom
cried triumphantly just like i said
this is not the time for pro-for that

  he began pacing back and forth in
front of his desk in the pose which his
press agents had made famous hands
clasped behind his short thick neck and
eyes raised ceiling-ward with an expres-
sion of great earnestness on his face

  laird sighed gently w w was in
one of his genius moods and the act
might last indefinitely he regarded
the little mans pacing figure with a
smile of pity he could never quite
decide whether the volatile little pro-
ducer had simply never grown up or
whether he was the victim of senility at
an early age

  and he really didnt care particularly

  hello laird a soft voice said be-
hind him arent you speaking to your
old friends any more

  laird turned in surprise smiling up
at him from the depths of a huge leather
chair was a small girl with honey-
colored hair and enormous eyes of lake-
water blue

  this was gloria turner and lairds
heart skipped several beats in apprecia-
tion of the fact she didnt resemble
the studio publicity stills which were
plastered throughout the nations maga-
zines and newspapers there was lack-
ing the sultry high-voltage appeal that
a camera caught she looked surpris-
ingly intelligent and nice she was
wearing a simple blue dress with a
white lace collar and her jewelry con-
sisted of one small bracelet

  laird sat down beside her because
he was afraid his legs werent going to
be trustworthy much longer there was
already a perceptible tremor at the
knees

  nice weather isnt it

  she grinned at him and he mentally
berated himself for a stupid lout words
were supposed to be his business and
here he was gibbering about the weather
like andy hardy on his first date next
he would probably loosen his tie and


fantastic adventures

mutter that it was getting warm

  he did and said precisely that

  the girl laughed softly

  i hadnt noticed it she said
gravely she glanced sideways at him
with an impish grin that just about
takes care of the weather doesnt it
mr baxter

  laird grinned back at her and lit a
cigarette somehow he felt at ease
again that was the wonderful thing
about this girl although he had only
spoken to her a few times he felt that
he had known her always there was
something genuine and friendly in her
attitude that charmed everyone she met
from producer to propboy

  why the heap big powwow he
asked

  i havent the faintest idea she an-
swered its some idea that w w has
cooked up

  it will probably be sensational
then laird said dryly

 w w winterbloom suddenly
stopped pacing for an instant he stood
stock-still head bowed then he
turned slowly and smiled at the room-
ful of people his mood had changed

  thank you for coming he said
gently it makes an old man feel good
to know that someone is still willing to
listen to him he sighed and clasped
his hands behind his back any mo-
ment he would blink back a tear and
that laird felt was the point at which
he would surely retch

x w padded slowly across the
y   thickly carpeted floor and stop-
ped in front of gloria turner there
was a mild paternal beam in his eye
he patted her gently on the head

  this little girl is like a daughter to
me he said with heavy sentimentality
i have watched her climbing up the
ladder of success with steady strokes
that quickly brought her out of the

waters of oblivion to the oasis of star-
dom

  he paused for a second obviously
pleased with this happy figure of
speech and now my little girl is going
up again past the top to the-

  he paused again and from the look
on his face it was apparent that even
his literary ingenuity was stumped with
the problem of what was beyond the
top

  the heights suggested laird

  as i was about to say w w con-
tinued with a grateful glance at laird
for the assist i have watched my little
girl reach the top and then go on to
scale the heights but she is not yet
through in fact this next year she is
going to be bigger than ever i have
decided that our own little gloria will
be apexs featured star for the coming
year that is one of the things i
wanted to tell you today that is one
of the reasons i asked you to be here
today

  w w began pacing again and now
there was the look of eagles in his eyes
the mood had changed again and the
little producer was tearing into an-
other of his favorite roles

  and how are we going to build up
our little gloria he demanded no
answer was expected and none was
forthcoming w w paused and swung
his gaze about the circle of assistants
ha he cried abruptly you have
nothing to say you are stumped
we face a crisis here that may affect
the entire motion picture industry and
on my own shoulders it is all falling
his tone softened i do not blame
you perhaps it is too much to expect
ordinary flesh and blood to take my
load of work and worry it is lucky i
am here with you in this hour of
trouble and woe i am not stumped
i do not hesitate or falter i have the
answer to our problem
trail of the magic slippers



  what is it w w an assistant
director who longed for full directorial
status asked in an awed hushed voice

  i am glad someone asked that the
little producer said briskly he wad-
dled back to his desk a personification
of decisive energy

  i will tell you we need a pub-
licity campaign to build up miss
turner in the eyes of the american
public that is your answer pub-
licity now we come to my other rea-
son for calling this conference

  he stepped aside suddenly and
pointed at a small ornately carven box
on top of his desk maybe you have
noticed this box he said smiling mys-
teriously he beckoned them to his
side with an expansive gesture come
closer my loyal workers and i will
show you the greatest publicity idea
since i discovered the bathing suit
come on laird murmured to
gloria this is going to be good

  they joined the circle at the desk
and w w smiled fondly at gloria

  this is all for you my child he
said

  he opened the box and lifted out a
small pair of slippers and with a dra-
matic flourish extended them for their
inspection

  the slippers were small and exqui-
sitely fashioned sparkling jeweled
straps crisscrossed the thin soles which
were apparently made of lustrous
ebony the heels were of medium
height and smoothly carved from
gleaming ivory

  why theyre lovely gloria cried
where did you get them

  ah the rotund producer smiled
mysteriously already you are asking
that soon all america will be asking
that and apex films will have the an-
swer these slippers came here with
a refugee from iran formerly persia
i know because i looked it up

  thats very interesting laird said
politely now what

  w w smiled inscrutably

  that is a good question now
what i will tell you these slippers
are a thousand years old they were
made by a famous wizard of persia for
the most beautiful princess who ever
lived whoever wears them the wizard
said will dance on the stars and rule all
men

  that might be fun gloria said
glancing at laird with a smile

  w w winterbloom had drawn him-
self up to his full five feet four as he
was speaking

  this is our new publicity cam-
paign he declared impressively

jaird felt again the strange sense
of bewilderment and confusion
that always claimed him when he was
forced to watch at close range the work-
ing of that strange thing known as the
hollywood mind w w winterbloom
was perfectly convinced that he had
proposed an idea that ranked in im-
portance to human advancement right
alongside the magna carta

  thats very brilliant someone in
the background commented cautiously

  laird regarded the slippers with a
jaundiced and dubious eye

  lets have an encore on the history
of these things he said im afraid
that some of the salient bits about the
wizard slipped by me

  you should be more attentive
w w said reprovingly these slip-
pers are enchanted he looked sol-
emnly about the circle of faces and
nodded secretively as if he actually
believed what he was saying

  you dont say someone said in
awed tones

  absolutely w w said emphati-
cally of course thats just the
story he shrugged might be that


fantastic adventures

they aint

  might be laird said dryly

  the important thing w w went
on is to sell the public on the idea
now i figure that if we arrange a big
sort of pageant and have gloria put on
the slippers for the first time there and
dance in em well sock the public right
in the eye anyway thats my idea
now if any of you dont like it speak
up i like frankness if it stinks
say so

  there was silence for an instant
well ww said and there was
an ominous undertone in his voice
whats the matter

  i think its great the assistant di-
rector said hurriedly beating everyone
else to the punch and practically assur-
ing himself a full directorship

  w w winterbloom beamed on the
young man

  do you really he smiled im
glad to hear you saying so i like your
independence young man i like a
man with a mind of his own now
what do the rest of you think

  there was a swelling chorus of adula-
tion and praise heaped on wws
brain-child and the smile on his face
widened until he was beaming like a de-
partment store santa claus

  i am touched he said softly
deeply touched by your faith in my
suggestion

  laird was getting bored he could
stand w w winterbloom but only in
small doses and he had just about
reached the saturation point

  well im glad everyones happy
he said ill be running along now
to-

  just a minute my son winter-
bloom said putting a hand on his shoul-
der theres something i want to say
to you ive been watching your work
and-he paused and nodded solemnly
-its good

  well thanks laird said weakly
im glad you-

  its so good that ive decided to give
you a real opportunity to show your
ability im going to put you in com-
plete charge of glorias magic slipper
pageant

  youre what

  naturally youre surprised win-
terbloom chuckled patting his shoul-
der but you will find my boy that
good fortune has a way of striking when
you least expect it

  now listen said laird grimly
im a writer not a publicity hound
i dont know a thing about this sort of
thing

  dont ever doubt your own ability
winterbloom said firmly always re-
member- i have faith in you

  hah laird snorted bitterly he
was on the point of telling winter-
bloom precisely what he could do with
the job when a thought occurred to
him this set-up would give him an
unparalleled opportunity to be near
gloria turner he was a sap not to
have thought of that immediately

tlje was on the point of telling win-
terbloom how overjoyed he was
when the door opened and a dark cy-
clone of feminine fury blew into the
room

  you stinking rat she screamed
everyone in the room turned guiltily
standing in the doorway clad in a skin-
tight black satin dress was a voluptu-
ous raven-haired creature whose hot
blazing eyes shot lightning about the
room her hands were set pugnacious-
ly on hips that seemed to undulate even
while she was standing still and the
polished toe of one spike-heeled sandal
was tapping the floor ominously she
wore black net hose over her long white
legs and she looked like a burlesque
queen whose butter and egg man had
trail of the magic slippers



sold out before price ceilings were fixed

  she was breathtaking in a violent
sort of way

  she was colette darcieux fading
star of apex films and a tornado of
temperament when aroused and from
all reliable indications she was plenty
aroused now

  hello my dear winterbloom said
with a nervous smile so nice to see
you again

  dont give me that oil colette
blazed she drew red lips back against
her very white teeth and snarled like a
lady panther whose cubs were in dan-
ger you little sneak i oughta cut
your heart out and squeeze it like a
sponge in front of your eyes

  winterbloom moaned and closed his
eyes a sheen of perspiration glistened
on his high forehead

  such a thought he muttered
you should be ashamed to talk like
that to your old friend colette

  colette wheeled on slim ankles and
glared at gloria a very unlady-like
sneer twisted her carmined lips

  so this is the twist that goin to
take my place eh she took in her
rivals fragile blonde loveliness with
frank scorn its like throwin choco-
lates to wolves after theyve gotten used
to hamburger she said icily

  gloria picked up her hat and gloves
if thats all she said evenly look-
ing at winterbloom i think ill be
running along

  please my dear w w said hast-
ily dont go theres something i
must discuss with you-alone

  all right you dont have to hit me
with a lead pipe colette said causti-
cally ill roll my hoop but if you
think im through with you you little
weasel youve got another guess com-
ing

she tossed a thousand dollar fur
piece about her neck with a scornful

gesture and flung out of the room
slamming the door after her

  a loud painful silence followed her
departure

  a very high-strung creature win-
terbloom said mopping his forehead
and breaking the silence he smiled
weakly temperamental a little she
is too

  youd hardly notice it laird mur-
mured

  you were probably noticing some-
thing else gloria said in a cool little
voice

  laird had been staring at colette
it had been impossible to do otherwise
a man could no longer ignore her
smouldering appeal than he could the
july sun at high noon

  but he hadnt thought gloria had no-
ticed his fascinated gaze and even
so he couldnt see why it should
bother her laird frowned and as very
bright people sometimes do he com-
pletely missed the obvious explanation

  now now winterbloom said rub-
bing his hands together briskly we
mustnt stand around wasting time we
must all get busy on this big idea of
mine laird ill expect you to have
things ready for a dress rehearsal by
next week

  gloria had already left as laird
turned back to his boss

  ok he said wearily ill have
your magic slippers shod and ready to
go come monday

chapter ii

vxhen monday rolled around
laird was as surprised as every-
one else that he had kept his word he
had bullied and badgered the prop de-
partments into getting his set ready on
time and he had rehearsed gloria until
she knew by heart the silly routine she
was to go through for the greater honor


fantastic adventures

and profits of apex films and for the
advancement of her own career

  the act was simple a line of cho-
rines supplied the background for
glorias dance she reclined on a soft
billowing couch in a diaphanous gown
of silver and lace that was cunningly
fashioned to reveal practically as much
as it concealed

  as she rose to her feet the magic
slippers descended amid a shower of
electric stars and from there on she
went into a simple dance routine that
was old when pericles was staging his
greek festivals

  there wasnt much to it but the pub-
licity about the enchanted slippers and
the strange story connected with them
was supposed to whet johnnie publics
appetite and counterbalance any short-
comings in the actual presentation

  laird was waiting impatiently to get
the nonsense over when winterbloom
strode onto the set wearing a wild
sport coat and a yachting cap on top
of his bald head

  my boy youve done miracles he
cried enthusiastically

  not quite said laird sourly

  the coziness he had imagined would
develop between himself and gloria as
a result of their working together had
strangely enough not materialized
she had been friendly but there was a
certain aloofness in her manner that
troubled him he was a very dis-
gusted young man and he was ex-
tremely anxious to get the job done so
he could get back to the comparatively
respectable employment of writing
scenarios

  everything was set to roll as winter-
bloom seated himself with an expectant
look on his face in the first row of the
seats that had been erected especially
for this performance

  im all pins and needles he said
smilingly to laird i feel i am going

to witness something big

  lets hope you arent disap-
pointed laird said

  gloria was reclining on a huge cot
on the center of the stage her gown
spreading about her in waves of soft
silver her long golden hair was
brushed down to her shoulders and
huge sunflowers winked against its
bright sheen she looked too lovely to
be real laird thought wistfully

  whenever youre ready he called
out

  ok she answered waving

  laird signalled and the lights went
down to a pale soft glow and the entire
scene was transformed into a picture of
fairy-like beauty

  the chorus went through its intro-
ductory steps with slow languorous
motions and gloria moving with lithe
grace raised herself from the great
couch and spread her arms wide in a
gesture of supplication and immolation

  it is beautiful winterbloom said
huskily i am feeling tears in my
eyes

  and i am feeling a pain in the
neck laird muttered under his
breath

  what winterbloom asked ab-
sently

  laird didnt bother to answer the
act was apparently just what the old
boy wanted and that was that he
personally was of the opinion that the
entire thing was ridiculous

  gloria had risen to her knees and was
swaying slowly back and forth her
eyes closed and the lashes dark shadows
against the theatrical whiteness of her
face

prom above her head a scintillating
galaxy of stars suddenly showered
down onto the stage brushing her long
golden hair and settling softly on the
billowing folds of her silver dress
trail of the magic slippers



  terrific i breathed winterbloom
in lairds ear

  gloria had raised her face to the set-
tling stars and she swayed voluptuously
as they caressed her cheeks and eyes
before drifting down to lie strewn about
her feet like the petals of flowers

  then through the mist of miniature
stars the ebony slippers appeared de-
scending slowly toward glorias up-
raised arms this seeming miracle was
accomplished by a prop boy who low-
ered the slippers on thin strands of
piano wire which were invisible in the
maze of artificial stars the effect
however was quite impressive

  gloria took the slippers when they
were within reach and slipped them on
her narrow bare feet then with a lithe
motion she sprang from the couch and
pirouetted brilliantly before going into
her dance routine

  marvellous winterbloom said
huskily such beauty and grace is too
much to be bearing

  laird realized then that he didnt
have and probably never would have
what it took to become an impresario
of w w winterblooms mettle the
first requirement necessary to reaching
such an exalted state would seem to be
a juvenile conception of drama and an
imbecilic idea of what constituted good
entertainment equipped with these
fundamentals a man could go far in
hollywood laird realized

  this moody reverie was shattered as
the little producer grabbed his arm ex-
citedly

  magnificent he hissed how
did you do it

  laird turned his attention back to the
stage wondering what had provoked
winterblooms amazed admiration
and when he saw what was happening
on the set his mouth dropped open
foolishly

  another swarm of stars had de-

  scended-but these stars were not the
product of electrical ingenuity and they
were not manipulated by prop men
perched above the stage

  these stars were an unscheduled at-
traction they glowed with a wild
fierce light and laird saw that they
were almost six inches in diameter

  gloria danced on apparently obliv-
ious to the arrival of this host of mys-
terious stars her eyes were closed
and there was an unreal expression of
ecstasy on her lovely white features
the stars floated down forming a
brilliant cone of light directly above her
shining head

  laird rose involuntarily to his feet
something was radically wrong and he
felt a strange fear plucking at his
nerves

  gloria  he shouted

  she apparently didnt hear for she
paid no attention to his cry there was
a dreamy drugged look on her beau-
tiful face as she raised her eyes to the
cone of stars that was settling over her
she raised her arms longingly as the
brilliant light enveloped her obscuring
her completely with misting cloying
radiance

  laird started for the stage but the
little producer dragged him back

  its glorious my boy he cried i
will make you a genius with your
ability

  laird shook his arm loose and sprang
for the set something was terribly
screwy here and he felt his heart thud-
ding anxiously against his ribs

  but before he could reach the stage
the cloud of stars suddenly flamed with
blinding brilliance and the next instant
they were gone

  laird had thrown an arm instinctive-
ly over his eyes and now when he
looked at the stage again he saw that
the line of chorus girls wrere staring in
frightened horror at the place where


fantastic adventures

gloria had been dancing

  laird ran a hand through his hair
dazedly he could hear w ws voice
bleating behind him and he was vague-
ly aware of the scared frightened whis-
pers of the girls and prop men

  but nothing penetrated the fog of
mystery and worry that was settling
over his mind

  for gloria had vanished with the
brilliant host of stars and that one fact
was enough to occupy all of lairds
attention

  it didnt make sense the whole
thing was crazy and incredible but-

  gloria was gone

chapter iii

vtf w winterbloom tapped
 him on the shoulder the
little producer was shaking his head
sadly

  i am disappointed my boy he
said heaving a great sigh i am not
impressed with the finale magic is
no good on the screen these days peo-
ple are fed up with disappearing acts

  that was no act laird said grim-
ly theres something screwy as hell
going on here and im going to find out
what it is

  he leaped onto the stage and stared
with baffled helplessness at the fright-
ened whispering line of chorus girls

  did any of you see gloria leave the
stage he barked the question at them

  they shook their heads and then all
began chattering at once from their
slightly hysterical stories laird real-
ized they knew no more than he did
about the mysteriously materialized
stars and glorias subsequent disap-
pearance

  he waved them into silence

  winterbloom was at his side again
panting from the exertion of having
climbed onto the stage

  my boy he said kindly dont
take this too hard i too have made
mistakes the disappearing act is a
lemorf that fact you must be facing
you will have to work out something
else bring gloria back here now and
we will talk this over remember
winterbloom is behind you and you
cannot fail

  laird ran both hands through his
hair distractedly

  listen he said grabbing the little
producers lapels gloria is gone i
had nothing to do with it i dont know
where in hell she is weve got to find
her send out an order to the studio
and well comb the lot until we do find
her

  winterbloom patted him on the
shoulder in a fatherly way

  you mustnt drive yourself so hard
my boy he said gently a rest you
must be taking for yourself

gloria is gone laird shouted
cant you get that fact through the
armor plate that you use for a skull
winterbloom flushed a delicate shade
of pink

  i do not like your tone he said
stiffly i am a big man a generous
man even my enemies cannot deny
that but unless you apologize-
oh for gods sake laird groaned
will you stop acting like the injured
heroine at the second act curtain this
is no time for petty nonsense dont
you realize that something damnably
queer has happened here that your
top-flight star has just vanished into
thin air if you arent worried about
her at least think of your investment
this blow struck home winter-
bloom mopped his damp brow with a
lavender handkerchief and regarded
laird with suddenly worried eyes

  you are not joking with an old man
are you my boy he asked in a husky
voice if gloria is gone we must find
trail of the magic slippers



her but this is impossible where
would she go why would she go

  well send out a studio alarm first
laird said crisply weve got to keep
this out of the papers for a while if
she doesnt turn up by tonight well
notify the police

  the police winterblooms voice
quavered on the word you dont
think-

  i dont know what i think laird
said but im damned worried

  winterbloom swallowed with an ef-
fort

  i will get busy he said and wad-
dled hurriedly away

  one of the chorus girls tapped laird
on the arm as winterbloom

  mr baxter she said i just found
something you might like to take a gan-
der at

  what is it

  the girl held out a small slipper it
was one of the ebony-soled slippers that
gloria had been wearing during the
dance

  laird took it from the girl and
studied it with worried eyes

  where did you find it he asked

  right in the center of the stage
the girl looked at the slipper and shud-
dered slightly it must have fallen off
when she swallowed uneasily when
she-left she finished emphasizing
the last word queerly

  laird put the slipper in his pocket

  thanks he said to the girl please
dont say anything about this right
away

  trust me the girl said i want
no part of this deal somethings goin
on here that i dont like

  she walked away quickly and laird
tried to fight down the premonition
that her words had evoked but it was
no use even though his reason insisted
that there would be a perfectly natural
and plausible explanation for glorias

mysterious disappearance he was still
worried damned worried   

phe next afternoon when he entered
winterblooms office his worry had
increased so with each passing hour
that he was on the point of blowing his
top completely

  there were three of four cops in the
office and at least a dozen newspaper-
men who immediately swarmed over
laird

  have you heard from her mr
baxter

  is this just a publicity gag

  has she eloped

  who with

  laird waved away the questions
wearily

  for gods sake he said lay off
this is no gag gloria has just dis-
appeared

  w w winterbloom was slumped be-
hind his immense desk managing to
look melancholy and angry at the same
time he pointed a shaking finger at
laird

  i am holding you personally respon-
sible he fumed if it hadnt been for
you all of this would never have hap-
pened to my pretty little star

  captain duffy a solid red-faced offi-
cer from the hollywood police station
looked inquiringly at laird

  how about it mr baxter he said
do you know something you havent
spilled yet mr winterbloom seems to
be implying that you know something
mr winterbloom is a victim of
chronic stupidity laird said angrily
i dont know a damn thing he was
there when she disappeared and i dont
know anymore than he does

  captain duffy inspected his finger-
nails carefully

  your position in this thing isnt
quite clear he said quietly you had
worked with gloria turner on this spe-
l

fantastic adventures

cial publicity gag i understand is that
right

  right laird said but-

  this disappearance might be part of
the gag captain duffy said thought-
fully he frowned and studied laird
for a minute if it is its only fair to
warn you that i am not going to be
amused

  how much longer are you going to
beat around the bush laird asked
ive told everything i know so has
everyone else the girl is gone the
studio has posted a reward why the
hell dont you get busy on the case in-
stead of making stupid conversation
captain duffy frowned

  i dont need you to tell me how to
handle this he snapped i think it
might be a good idea to hold you for
questioning

  laird waved his hands despairingly
  well do something he said

  this is terrible moaned winter-
bloom every day that girl is gone is
costing me thousands of dollars
thats the fine unselfish attitude
that has made you loved and respected
throughout the industry laird said
sarcastically he put his hat on and
walked to the door if anybody wants
me ill be at the studio bar getting
drunk

  now laird my boy winterbloom
cried dont do anything foolish why
dont you go back to your office and
finish the script you are working on
that will take your mind off this terri-
ble thing also i am paying you to
work not to sit around getting drunk
with liquor

  laird regarded him sourly for an in-
stant and then left the office banging
the door behind him with enough force
to cause the three autographed pictures
of w w winterbloom which deco-
rated the walls of that worthys office
to quiver for seventeen seconds

aird went directly to the studio
bar and ordered a bottle of scotch
he knew the scotch wouldnt help his
thinking particularly but it might calm
his nerves

  two hours later his nerves were not
noticeably any calmer but laird was
definitely and noticeably drunk the
bottle of scotch was empty at his elbow
and the last cigarette of his second pack
was burning low in his fingers

  he signalled a waiter by holding one
leg high above his table in what seemed
to him an ingenious and effective man-
ner it was effective for the waiter
dropped everything to hurry to his side

  you feel all right mr baxter he
asked solicitously

  laird regarded him stonily

  your question implies that i
shouldnt be feeling all right he said
with slow dignity and missing only
about half of the vowels and conso-
nants in the sentence he lowered his
leg solemnly

  you been drinking pretty steady
the waiter said maybe you should
sort of taper off

  this seemed like rather stupid advice
to laird he decided that the waiter
must be a dull fellow

  bring me another bottle and gloria
turner he said moodily he stared
dejectedly at his empty glass the
mention of her name had pierced
sharply through the alcoholic fog with
which he was trying to cloud his
thoughts he sighed wearily he
wasnt as drunk as hed hoped he
could still remember

  he got up and left the bar unsteadily
outside it was getting dark and there
was a chill in the air that penetrated
his warm armor of scotch

  he started for his own office wonder-
ing miserably what he could do to help
find gloria he couldnt just wait
around until some definite word was re-
trail of the magic slippers



ceived hed go nuts there must be
something he could do

  when he reached the long gravelled
lane that connected the executives
building with the writers he saw a slim
dark girl just emerging from the palatial
entrance of the studio heads lair

  she was colette darcieux and she
looked like a sleek tigress that had just
polished off about ten pounds of suc-
culent deer steak she sauntered past
laird with her chin in the air and it
wasnt until she was a dozen steps away
that a sudden brainstorm hit him

  colette he yelled trotting after
her

  she turned with swivel-hipped grace
and regarded him with languorous sur-
prised eyes

  yes

  she was wearing a tight red silk dress
and her long blue-black hair fell to her
shoulders framing her hard white face
in a halo of dark enchantment her
legs were symphonies of slender sym-
metry in hose that was as sheer as
moonmist she looked regal and ter-
rific and she was completely aware of
that fact

  i want to talk to you a moment
laird said he smiled as an after-
thought for the girls charm left him
completely cold he could have as soon
worked up enthusiasm over a marble
statue

  ive got an appointment colette
said what was it you wanted to talk
to me about she was smart enough to
know that laird was one of the bright
young men of the studio and that he
might some day be helpful he wasnt
a producer but who knows what might
develop in hollywood

  its a rather personal matter
laird said his idea was now fully de-
veloped and while it was probably crazy
and nonsensical he wanted to give it a
chance

  colette was looking at him queerly
and he smiled

  youre drunk colette said regard-
ing him suspiciously

  with the magic of your nearness
laird said with a courtly bow that al-
most landed him on his head the line
was corny but it was the best he could
manage in his condition anyway
colette wasnt the discriminating type
the producers she consorted with
thought brains were something kept in
laboratory bottles

  colette smiled and there was specula-
tion in her eyes

  thats very sweet of you she mur-
mured

  this little matter i want to discuss
with you is rather of a private nature
laird said supposing we go up to my
apartment its quiet there and the
fireplace works wonderfully on chilly
nights like this you wont be bored
i promise you

  colette chuckled softly in her throat
she smiled archly

  you too she said i thought you
were different honey

  its just a vicious rumor laird
smiled

  obviously said colette her
smile was provocatively warm but the
lights of speculation in her eyes were
cold and sharp she was obviously
weighing all the angles

  finally she slipped her hand through
lairds arm

  come on well go to my apart-
ment im dying to hear what you
have to say

  laird smiled into her deep glinting
eyes

  youll be surprised he said

 i dont think so murmured
colette squeezing his arm gently

  laird turned his face to hide the grin
on his face what a hell of a surprise
youre in for he thought wickedly   


fantastic adventures

chapter iv

rolettes apartment was an im-
mense affair strewn with trophies
of the type dear to its mistresss ada-
mantine heart these spoils of battle
were in the form of furniture rugs and
accessories that would have ransomed a
casting director and they were a lush
tribute to the money if not the brains
of hollywoods most generous pro-
ducers

  colette ordered her maid to bring
drinks and then settled down on a
lounge and crossed her long silken legs

  do you feel like talking business
now she asked with a smile

  not right away laird said

  the maid came in with martinis
laird took one with considerable mis-
givings the scotch he had drunk was
doing its work very effectively and he
didnt need the additional stimulation
of this martini but there was nothing
else to do so he drank it

  colette sipped her drink and told the
maid as she was leaving to bring in the
vermouth gin and some ice when the
maid returned colette told her she
could have the rest of the evening off
the maid did not seem surprised by this
development she obviously expected
it

  when she had gone and the apart-
ment was quiet colette leaned back
against the softly cushioned lounge and
smiled softly at laird

  its cozy here isnt it

  very nice laird said he mixed
two more drinks and he spiked colettes
very heavily she would have to catch
up with him before he could try out his
little idea

  colette patted the sofa beside her
and smiled meaningly at laird

  i feel taller standing up laird
muttered he wondered then with the
first twinge of misgivings if he were

going to be able to put this thing over
it would all depend on colettes state
of mind and her mind was running in
one rather definite direction at the mo-
ment but he couldnt risk offending
her

  she was regarding him in a puzzled
fashion so he mixed two more drinks
and sat down beside her she ran a hand
through his hair and smiled lazily
thats better isnt it

  much he fidgeted a moment
you need another drink he said ab-
ruptly

  but i havent started this one
thats what i mean drink up
colette giggled and finished the mar-
tini laird got up promptly and that
was almost a mistake the room re-
volved in a crazy circle and he felt his
knees buckling and it took all his will
power to keep on his feet he took two
drinks back to the lounge and his navi-
gation defied every premise of the law
of gravity

  honey said colette youre get-
ting drunk

  it is your mind i admire laird
said thickly that streak of discern-
ing observation uncanny positively
uncanny

  that sounds like a crack colette
said with a noticeable trace of grimness

  at the sound of the cracking it will
be exactly time for another drink
laird said solemnly he got up and
made his way again to the cocktail
table he wondered vaguely who was
supposed to be getting whom drunk

  on the lounge again coiette studied
him with puzzled eyes she was getting
tight but the little points of speculation
still gleamed brightly in her eyes

  was there something you wanted to
talk to me about she asked her
coquettish air was fading there was a
definite hardness in her voice

  yes indeed laird frowned i
trail of the magic slippers



must talk with you a very important
matter which- his voice trailed out
slowly and the frown deepened on his
brow what the hell was he supposed
to talk to her about he stared drunk-
enly about the lushly furnished apart-
ment why was he here in the first
place he had had an idea that was
it but what kind of an idea he
looked closely at colette and then
shook his head it hadnt been that
she still didnt appeal to him

tte fumbled for a cigarette and
his hand touched a hard object in
his coat pocket there were hard
beaded straps attached to this object
and after a moment of frowning thought
he realized it was the slipper that gloria
had dropped the day she disappeared

  he had carried it with him since then
hoping it would lead in some way to a
solution of the mystery of her disap-
pearance

  that was it that was his idea he
snapped his fingers excitedly

  forget something colette asked
another appointment

  no i remembered something
laird said he turned and smiled at
her do you mind if i turn on the
radio

  colette stared at him in surprise and
then a slow smile brushed her lips she
settled back on the lounge

thats more like it she murmured
laird turned on the radio and dialed
to a concert orchestra playing a dreamy
waltz he made his way back to colette
and took her hands

  lets dance

  dance colette said sharply
what kind of an act is this

  please laird said urgently you
were made for dancing for smooth flow-
ing motion for the graceful movements
of music and water

  well i put in my hitch on the burly

circuit colette said but nobody ever
watched my dancing

  i can well imagine laird mur-
mured

  reluctantly colette stood up and
moved into his arms they began
dancing slowly to the music laird
danced badly under any circumstances
but fortified as he was by an immense
amount of alcoholic beverage he was
several notches below lousy

  oh ecstasy colette muttered sar-
donically where are the divers
boots

  fine isnt it laird beamed at
her

  for the people who make corn plas-
ters i suppose you mean colette said
wearily

  your shoes are probably too tight
laird said sternly did you ever try
dancing without shoes as one who
was once known to his intimates as the
shoeless wonder of the waltz i cant
recommend it too highly

  youre crazy colette said

  thats right laird agreed but its
still a good idea

  he danced silently for a few seconds
and pondered the situation it called
for drastic measures with a sigh he
deliberately trod heavily on colettes
left foot

  she yelled something unprintable at
him and hopped across the room to a
chair she took off her patent leather
pump and threw it at him with more
enthusiasm than aim

  you clumsy oaf she snapped as
she massaged her foot tenderly with her
hand you must have learned how to
dance from a truck horse

  i cant tell you how sorry i am
laird said sorrowfully here let me
help

  he knelt in front of her and took her
foot in his hands he patted it gently
that feels better doesnt it


fantastic adventures

  well yes colette admitted with-
out too much enthusiasm

  all you need now is another shoe
laird said he frowned and then
snapped his fingers presto

  he dug into his pocket and pulled out
the tiny ebony slipper to the rescue
he slipped it on her foot before she
could say a word

  youre all set now he said briskly
standing up lets finish our dance
ive had enough of your brand of
waltzing colette said she was turn-
ing her foot about studying the ebony
slipper with the jeweled straps and
ivory heel where did you get this
fancy job wheres the mate

  laird wagged a finger at her

  ah did cinderella ask for the other
shoe

  i dont know colette said i
never liked her script anyway she
shouldve married the prince before
twelve and to hell with the conse-
quences

aird took her hands again

  please lets finish our dance
ill be more careful

  do i look crazy

  laird let go her hands and pulled out
his handkerchief he mopped his brow
in despair his whole wacky idea de-
pended on her dancing with him now
while she was wearing the slipper his
idea was based on the simple logic of
a drunk something had happened to
gloria while she was dancing in those
slippers duplicate the circumstances
with the slipper shed left behind and
the same thing might happen again
that was his simple and uncomplicated
reasoning

  it wasnt that he wanted colette to
disappear as gloria had but he hoped
to learn something this time of glorias
whereabouts colette was simply a
guinea pig a damned uncooperative

one at that

  the time he knew had come when
pressure was needed

  darling he said softly did you
know that w w is giving me a shot at
my own production this year

  colettes sulky look faded magically

  how wonderful she cried

  laird smiled benignly and nodded

  thats what i thought he said
would you like to dance now my
dear

  why of course colette said
springing to her feet an ecstatic ex-
pression on her face

  thank you laird said grinning

  they started dancing again moving
slowly to the music

  colettes eyes were closed and she
was smiling softly

  lairds eyes were open and he was
watching the ceiling hopefully they
had been dancing several minutes be-
fore he noticed the faint brilliance
forming above their heads miniature
stars seemed to be swirling down from
the ceiling settling softly about them
in a cloying dazzling haze

 darling colette murmured
someone must have turned on the
lights in the apartment across the court
it seems to be getting brighter here

  keep your eyes closed laird said
you look absolutely divine that way

  you sweet boy

  the stars were swimming down now
brighter and larger and suddenly
laird felt the tug of a powerful suction
that seemed to be as inevitable and
ruthless as the surge of a mighty tide

  colette opened her eyes and there
was a wild fear in their depths she
screamed and fought his arm around
her waist

  laird whats happening let
me go

  laird felt the powerful suction drag-
ging the girl from his arm and he tight-
trail of the magic slippers



ened his grip and dung to her with all
his strength

  a blackness was spilling over him
blotting out all thoughts and sensation

  he heard colettes wild scream a
mixture of terror and anger and then
he felt himself plunging headlong into
a vast tunnel of brilliant radiance that
stretched ahead of him endlessly and
limitessly

  that was his last conscious thought

chapter iv

jaird regained consciousness not
slowly and gradually as he had
always imagined it happened but in
one brief flash his eyes were open his
head was clear and he was staring about
in considerable amazement

  he was lying on what was apparently
a vast silken bed which could have ac-
comodated the sextet from lucia
above him a vast ceiling gleaming with
a soft pearl light vaulted to a majestic
arch dozens of feet in the air

  the room he was lying in was huge
and it was furnished in a style of bar-
baric luxury that was astonishing
great tiger skins were strewn carelessly
about the shining black marble floor
in the corners deep burnished incense
pots were smouldering the heavily
scented smoke drifted toward the ceil-
ing in slow languorous wreaths and
collected there in a filmy pall that was
like a cloud on a bright day

  couches covered with soft gleaming
silk and strewn with great fat pillows
lined the walls the room laird
thought looked like the ideal setting for
a dionysian carousal

  he noticed that he was wearing his
tweed suit it seemed very much out
of place in this chamber of sensuous
luxury he was surprised to find that
he had no hangover his head felt
clear and his body felt well rested

  what the hell set is this

  laird hadnt spoken he looked
around in surprise and saw no one but
he knew that voice he crawled across
the huge bed and looked over the side
there sitting on the marble floor with
a comical expression of mingled be-
wilderment and rage on her cold fea-
tures was colette darcieux she was
still wearing her tight red dress but it
looked pretty wrinkled and laird also
noticed that the small graceful magic
slipper still adorned her left foot

  she scrambled to her feet when she
saw him her eyes flashing with anger

  what kind of a gag is this she
shouted in a high shrill voice she
placed her hands on her hips in a bellig-
erent gesture what was the idea of
bringing me here youd better make
with the explanations smart boy

  laird leaned back and yawned with
irritating slowness

  i do not know a thing my pretty
little witch he said sweetly

  he was thinking of the last scene he
remembered in colettes apartment
the swirling cone of stars had been
sweeping them up and away precisely
as they had done to gloria where they
were how they had gotten here what
was in store for them were questions
he couldnt answer

  colette from the expression on her
face was apparently remembering a
few things also she looked at the slip-
per she was wearing and a puzzled
vaguely troubled look clouded her
face

  we mustve been pretty drunk she
said uncertainly i mustve had the
dts for sure she shuddered
slightly and looked about the vast si-
lent incense-clouded room a lot of
funny things happened while we were
dancing just before i passed out i
seem to remember a flock of stars float-
ing down from the ceiling crazy


fantastic adventures

isnt it

  maybe said laird maybe not
colette suddenly shook her long dark
hair angrily

  this is some kind of a gag and i
dont like it you mustve slipped me
a mickey you-you rat im getting
out of this dump on the double quick
and waitll i tell old winterbloom
what kind of a heel you are hell-

a great booming gong shattered
the stillness the sound of its
mighty tones caused the solid marble
under their feet to quiver the ring-
ing sonorous sound faded slowly and
the silence that followed pressed in on
them inexorably

  colette glanced nervously around
and moved closer to laird

  what goes she asked sharply i
dont like this joint one bit its too
much like the hideout of fu manchu
to suit me

  laird saw then that two mighty
bronze doors at the opposite end of the
room were opening slowly he stood
up and straightened his tie

  look your best he murmured to
colette we have company

  colette followed his gaze and her
hand suddenly tightened on his arm
laird im scared she whispered
well dont feel lonesome laird
said so am i

  the doors swung open soundlessly
the first thing laird saw was another
vast room revealed through the open
doorway the second was the small
round figure that was standing under
the high arch of the great bronze doors
regarding them in silence

  whos he whispered colette

  my dear girl laird said this is
not my county estate i know nothing
of what goes on here he might be the
shah of persia for all i know

  the little man after his momentary

pause in the doorway moved toward
them slowly he wore high-waisted
loose silk trousers that fell in billowing
folds to his pointed red leather slippers
a huge ornate turban was swathed
about his head and he seemed to be
bowed a bit under its weight his face
was round and soft and brown his eyes
looked sad his age was indeterminable

  he stopped about six feet from them
and looked from colette to laird he
looked back to colette and his sad eyes
blinked several times the expression
on his face however remained a sad
mixture of melancholy resignation

  i am el amo the shah of persia
he said he spoke in english without
changing expression he had a slight
lisp and he looked as if he were pouting
when he talked

  and im buffalo bill said laird
cordially the pleasure is all mine
he bowed to colette my colleague
sitting bull

  very funny the little man said in
a mournful voice he was about as
round as he was tall and when he spoke
he seemed to quiver all over like a
mound of soft jelly

  there was something in his voice that
strangely affected laird it was a
quality of sincerity and honesty if
the little guy were crazy he didnt know
it but laird realized so many screwy
things had happened to him in the past
few days that who the hell was he to
decide who or who wasnt nuts

  maybe he was crazy himself not
maybe probably

  the little round man who called him-
self the shah of persia was regarding
colette with the type of interest with
wthich most men regarded colette and
colette was studying the big bright
emerald that adorned the shahs tur-
ban with the type of attention most
girls bestow on big bright emeralds

  ah soul mates murmured laird
trail of the magic slippers



how beautiful

  would you like to join my harem
the shah asked colette with a wistful
note in his voice

  would you like to take a jump in
the lake snapped colette

  she means yes laird said to the
shah but cant we put off all this
delightful nonsense until later right
now im just a mite curious about
where i am and how i got here would
you care to oblige us shah with a little
information

  y-yes said the shah

  look at me and you wont stutter
laird advised him

jphe shah blinked his eyes rapidly
and with an obvious effort turned
from colette to laird

  i will tell you what you want to
know but you wont believe me he
said sadly his round brown face was
sad his soft brown eyes were sad he
looked sad all over

  well shoot laird said

  if you will just try and believe me
instead of telling me that i am crazy
the shah said it will be better for all
of us

  he looked sadly from laird to
colette

  i am the shah of persia this is
the eleventh century you came here
through the medium of a time device
he glanced moodily at the slipper
colette was wearing and shook his fat
head slowly the slipper did it he
murmured almost to himself

  colette laughed bitterly

  youre nuttier than a fruit cake
chum

  the shah turned sad eyes to her and
shrugged his fat round shoulders de-
spairingly

  you see

  he turned to laird

  you think im crazy too

  laird scratched his head and sat
down on the edge of the bed

  somebody is he said he suddenly
remembered gloria have you seen
anything of a blonde girl around here
the shah nodded somberly

  they have her he said gloomily
who are they demanded laird
my grand vizer and my cousin
very soon they will exile me and rule
persia he sighed unhappily

  i dont get this said laird sup-
posing you start at the beginning and
bring me up to date

  my grand vizer is a very ruthless
man by name of raschid my cousin
is a very lovely heartless girl by name
of seramidis they are conspiring to
put seramidis on the throne of persia in
my place he glanced moodily down
at the slipper on colettes foot they
will do it now without delay

 why

  now they have both the magic slip-
pers the blonde girl was brought here
by them but one of the slippers was
gone they were very enraged but
there was nothing they could do with
only one slipper now they will have
both and i will soon be exiled he
sighed again i am very unhappy
he glanced at colette youre sure
you dont want to join my harem
youre afflicted with a one-track
mind laird said where is gloria
now

  gloria

  the blonde girl the one we were
talking about

  oh her they have her she is in
one of the dungeons i suppose sera-
midis doesnt like pretty girls around
her

  laird got to his feet grimly
dungeons eh well see about
that what the hell do they mean treat-
ing the kid that way

  the shah shrugged unhappily


fantastic adventures

i dont know i wouldnt do that to
her i would ask her to join my harem
look wise guy snapped laird
another crack like that and ill churn
that fat of yours into butter

  the shah smiled weakly it doesnt
mean anything he shrugged discon-
solately they never join anyway
colette stamped her foot angrily
this is all a waste of time she blazed
i want to get out of here and go home
im sick and tired of listening to this
mad man rave on

  im not leaving without gloria
laird said ill find her if i have to
tear this joint down with my bare
hands

  this isnt one of your scripts you
know colette said

  the shah held up his soft little hands
in an entreating gesture

  please listen to me i am telling
you the truth you will not be able to
leave here until raschid gives the word
you will save yourself much trouble if
you accept the situation maybe to-
gether we can do something

  i am a patient man laird said
ominously but i too am tiring of your
chatter my little round chum youre
either as batty as an old church steeple
or youre an out-and-out phony if
youre the shah of persia how does it
happen youre speaking good english
we learned it from the crusaders
they have been through here many
times you know he smiled weakly
they speak it rather oddly they say
methinks god wot and other things
like that we dont use those expres-
sions because they seem silly

  that tops everything so far laird
said

  im getting out of here colette
cried this place is getting on my
nerves

  the shah shook his head sadly and
his fat jowls quivered

  you are in for a great disappoint-
ment i fear he said

  as he finished speaking the great
gong sounded again shattering the still-
ness of the room with its mighty rever-
berations the huge bronze doors be-
gan to swing open slowly

  whos this asked laird worriedly

  raschid and seramidis the shah
said gloomily he shuddered and raised
his eyes to the heavens allah save
us

  heaven will protect the working
girl colette said but her voice was
nervously weak

  fine laird said but whos going
to look after me

  the mighty doors opened slowly

chapter v

qphree majestic nubian eunuchs
marched slowly through the open
door they were great magnificent
specimens nearly eight feet in height
and as wide across as two ordinary men
their clothing was silken and the tiny
jewels sewed along the seams glittering
brilliantly in the light of the room tur-
bans as large as pumpkins were wound
around their great dark heads

  harem guards the shah informed
laird and colette moodily they pre-
vent anyone from entering the private
quarters of the harem girls of raschid
he sighed i have to have guards to
keep my girls in

  following the giant guards were a
tall imperious couple clothed extrav-
agantly in lush silks and decorated with
dozens of brilliant jewels of all types
and description

  the three guards separated as they
approached and the man and woman
they were escorting moved forward with
deliberate majestic strides until they
were within a few yards of laird
colette and the fat little shah
trail of the magic slippers



  there they stopped the man ras-
chid was tall and spare his face was
gray and against this grayness his glit-
tering eyes seemed burningly alive he
fingered a tiny jeweled knife at his sash
and smiled coldly

  it was thoughtful of you to receive
our guests he murmured addressing
the shah i hope you have put them
at their ease

  el amo shrugged and looked help-
lessly at laird and colette

  seramidis was studying laird in-
tently and laird felt acutely uncom-
fortable under the directness of her
gaze she was an attractive woman in
a brittle statuesque sort of way her
skin was as pale as ivory and the only
color in her face was in the ruby red-
ness of her full lips and in the deep blue
pools of her eyes the soft silken
garment she wore concealed and at the
same time accentuated the slim perfec-
tion of her form there was no warmth
in her beauty even her long red hair
was a hard lusterless shade that seemed
to emphasize the whiteness of her
classic features and the cold blue of her
eyes

  laird felt a perspiration breaking
out on his forehead he could imagine
this creature condemning a slave to tor-
ture with the same graceful motion that
she would pluck a petal from a rose

  you seem to be making an impres-
sion colette said sardonically

  at the sound of her voice seramidis
turned her attention from laird and
studied colette with the same cold ex-
pressionless gaze finally she smiled
contemptuously

  the man looks interesting she
murmured to raschid but the girl
she lifted her delicate eyebrows scorn-
fully she would not even draw a
second glance at the slave marts

  that takes care of you laird
grinned

  colette shook her long hair angrily
she bared her small white teeth in a
very unlady-like snarl

  listen you cheap looking bag of
bones she yelled ive seen classier
dames than you waiting table in flop
houses

  as she moved forward with mayhem
in mind seramidis gaze dropped to her
feet and instantly a spot of excited
color flamed in her white cheeks

  she took raschids arm with tense
fingers

  look she whispered her other
hand was pointing at the ivory slipper
colette was wearing on her left foot

  praise to allah murmured ras-
chid piously the enemy has been
delivered into our hands

  he uttered a sharp command in a
strange tongue

  one of the huge guards stepped to
colettes side and with one arm about
her waist swung her into the air as easily
as he would a doll colettes arms and
legs flailed wildly and she screamed in
surprised terror but she was carried
helplessly to where seramidis and ras-
chid stood

t aschid removed the slipper from
her foot and almost lost his front
teeth in the process as colette kicked
viciously at his face he presented the
slipper to seramidis who pressed it to
her breast with a fervent cry of ecstatic
triumph

  may allah save us the shah mur-
mured to laird there is no hope left
from any other source

  the giant guard deposited colette on
the floor and seemed extremely happy
to be relieved of his clawing scratching
burden

  ill teach you to manhandle a lady
you big jerk colette screamed shak-
ing her fist in the guards surprised
vacant face she would have had to


fantastic adventures

stand on a beer barrel to hit him but
the guard backed away uneasily a
tragic look of bewilderment on his
stupid blank features

  pardon my curiosity laird said
sarcastically to raschid but i feel
were entitled to a bit of information
we came looking for a young girl whom
we have reason to believe is here some-
where wed also like to know where
we are and when we can leave
raschid smiled but there was no
amusement in his eyes

  the girl you mention is here he
said the land you are in is persia
the time  ad your last question
in regard to when you may leave i can
answer in one word never

  im going to have something to say
about that laird snapped im-
raschid barked an order two of
the guards closed in on laird and he
was instantly pinioned helplessly in
the grip of their mighty hands he
didnt even bother to struggle it
would have been like picking a scrap
with gargantua

  the other guard scooped up colette
beneath an arm as thick as the trunk
of an oak tree and held her there despite
her clawing screaming struggles

  i am tired of your company ras-
chid murmured perhaps a few days
in the dungeons will make you more
interesting

  he gave another sharp command to
the guards and they lumbered toward
the door carrying colette and laird as
easily as if theyd been children   

  the dungeon to which laird and
colette were forcibly escorted by the
huge guards proved to be a vast drafty
room with slate walls and ceiling on
which a damp sweat collected and
trickled to the floor

  the place was musty and dank and
it stank from the fumes of the coarse
candles which supplied a flickering un-

certain illumination

tn the center of this room were two
scaffolds with thick iron rings at-
tached to the cross-bar lairds hands
were bound together with thick leather
thongs and the end of this strap was
passed through the iron ring and pulled
up until he was practically standing on
his toes with his hands suspended above
his head

  the position was not particularly un-
comfortable but he didnt relish the
thought of spending the remainder of
his life in the attitude of a man going
after a forward pass

  the guards then strung colette up in
the same position so that she faced
laird after an inspection of the straps
and a few grunted monosyllables the
giant guards lumbered away closing
and locking the heavy stone door be-
hind them

  alone at last laird said with a
sigh ah the ecstacy of it all
colette struggled futilely at her bonds
and glared at him with eyes that would
have shamed an enraged panther

  you got me into this she cried
if i ever get loose youll pay for this
laird baxter

  that is a very uncharitable senti-
ment laird observed mildly were
both in the same boat and the least you
could do is be cheerful about it
wouldnt you like to join me in a rol-
licking camp-fire girl song wonderful
thing for the spirits im told

  shut up colette screamed she
tugged angrily on the strap that held
her wrists and then in a rage she kicked
her remaining shoe at laird
fortunately it missed

very unwise laird smiled the
high heel added two inches to your
height now youre going to learn toe
dancing whether you like it or not
colette soon discovered that laird
trail of the magic slippers



was telling the truth standing on tip-
toes she glared at him as if he was
entirely responsible for her new pre-
dicament

 you-

  tut tut mustnt swear laird said
quickly now be reasonable baby
this is a tough spot and were going to
have to work together to come out on
top

colette tossed her head sulkily
you got me into it you get me out
thats a fine spirited attitude
laird said but it wont do you one
damn bit of good

  im cold colette said in a more
reasonable voice

  cant do much about that laird
said the big job is to get out of
here

  yes but where are we

  my guess would be that we are in
dear old romantic persia sometime dur-
ing the eleventh century if that sounds
crazy dont mention it i know it does
but its the only answer i can think of
youre getting buggy as that chubby
wolf el amo colette said sarcasti-
cally what do you mean this is persia
in the eleventh century 

  lady said laird i dont pretend
to knew the why and wherefore but i
just know these people weve met arent
kidding

  youre nuts said colette she was
silent then for a while but after a few
moments she asked if this is persia
and its the eleventh century what the
devil are we going to do

  laird shrugged and smiled

  lets just hang around a while and
see what happens he suggested

  on top of everything else you gotta
make with the puns colette said dis-
gustedly she twisted uncomfortably
and raised herself on her toes to relieve
the strain on her arms why did i
ever meet you she wailed

jpor almost an hour they stared at
each other without further conversa-
tion and with each passing second they
became more uncomfortable

  but just about the time that laird
was losing hope the lock rattled on the
solid stone door and an instant later
el amo the shah waddled into the
dungeon

  colette gave a cry of relief

  you look as good as a million nine-
teen twenty six dollars she said fer-
vently

  el amo looked sadder than usual
his face looked like a melancholy
pumpkin he sighed heavily

  there is no hope for any of us he
said sighing again and quivering with
the effort seramidis has the slippers
and is now in complete command i
am going to be exiled

  but whats going to happen to us
asked laird

  el amo shrugged he seemed to
shrug all over

  i dont know probably you will
be killed i am going to be exiled
you said that before laird said
you have my sympathy of course but
i am still selfish enough to be worried
about us when is that she-wolf going
to give us the works

pretty soon el amo answered
he didnt sound very interested he
looked at colette wistfully i am going
to be exiled will you come with me
colettes eyes lit with hope

  sold she snapped to get out of
this rat trap id go with frankensteins
monster

  el amo appeared additionally sad-
dened by this information

  seramidis would never let you go
he said almost on the verge of tears

  listen to me laird said give us
at least a chance cut us down and
maybe we can help you put the lid on
this seramidis dish


fantastic adventures

  it wouldnt help el amo said
she has the slippers now and is in-
vincible the legend says that the
wearer of the magic slippers will dance
on the stars and rule all men the
stars mean the time device and the
ruler of all men part means just what
it says there is no hope i will be
exiled he sniffed sadly

  i seem to recall your mentioning
that before laird said

  el amo drew a small dagger from
his sash and cut the strap that held
lairds wrists

  i do not know what we can do he
said mournfully

  laird rubbed his wrists gratefully

  anyway we can try he said

  hey dont forget me colette
yelled

  el amo cut her down from the scaf-
fold and slashed the thongs that bound
her wrists she stretched like a cat to
relieve her cramped muscles and then
padded to the door with them in her
stocking feet

  where to asked laird

  we have only one chance el amo
said we must gain possession of the
slippers he coughed nervously
seramidis is wearing them now she
and raschid are together in one of their
hidden meeting chambers i will show
you the way there that is all i can
do

  that may be enough laird said

  he and colette followed el amo out
of the dungeon and through a maze of
dimly lit inter-twining passages that
honey-combed the sub structure of the
shahs palace they passed dozens of
guards and minor officials but el amos
presence was a sure-fire passport as
yet he was still head man

  finally they came to a marble door at
the end of a long corridor el amo
opened this and beckoned them to fol-
low him into the long well-lighted

passageway that stretched ahead he
also laid a finger over his lips his
meaning was obvious

yxrhen they reached the end of this
passageway el amo pointed
meaningly to a heavy drapery that cov-
ered a wide high-arched portal from
beyond the drapery laird could hear
the soft murmur of a feminine voice

  she is in there el amo whispered
his entire body was shaking like a
model t ford

  laird moved softly across the floor
and peered through a vent in the
drapery the room into which he
looked was small and exquisitely fur-
nished reclining on a deep couch in
the center of the chamber was sera-
midis her flaming red hair fell over
the rolled back of the lounge to brush
against the blue-veined marble floor
she was lying on her back her long
slim legs stretched out on the sofa and
on her narrow high-arched feet
twinkled the ivory slippers

  raschid was pacing slowly back and
forth smoking a long-stemmed pipe and
passing within inches of laird each
time he reversed his steps

  heres our chance he whispered
tensely to colette

  the next time raschid passed the
drapery laird went into action with
one hand he flung the curtain aside and
with the other he grabbed the grand
vizer by the neck

  raschid wheeled and broke away
from his grip his lean hard face was
frozen in an astonished mask with a
gesture to swift for an eye to follow his
hand streaked to the jeweled dagger
that was sheathed in his broad waist
sash

  that was his big mistake he hadnt
ever heard of the marquis of queens-
bury and the innovations that had been
developed in the future concerning the
trail of the magic slippers



effectiveness of the right cross

  laird swung all his lean hard weight
behind the punch and it caught the
grand vizer squarely on the point of
his long jaw the grand vizer went
down and stayed down laird leaped
over his prostrate form and lunged
toward seramidis

  she was scrambling to her feet as he
charged her cool classic features were
white with rage

  stop she cried

  something seemed to crash into the
base of lairds skull it wasnt any-
thing physical it was his own mental
reaction to the command of the flaming
woman who stood before him arms
raised imperiously he couldnt help
himself he stopped as if he had
collided with a stone wall

  you fool seramidis said scath-
ingly have you forgotten that i am
the master of all men you are helpless
to disobey my commands with the
power of the magic slippers i rule the
will of every man

  laird fought to take a step toward
the woman but he was completely help-
less his muscles seemed to be locked
in a deadly paralysis

  you may control men a cold hard
voice said behind him but what about
women

  lairds eyes were on seramidis face
and he saw her suddenly shift her gaze
to a point beyond his shoulder the
expression on her face with diabolical

  i have this for women she cried
her hand swept to the glittering dagger
at her waist

  a dark cyclone whipped past laird
and he had a panormic glimpse of a
flying skirt and streaming black hair as
colette charged into seramidis as if
she had been shot from a catapault

  the two women went to the floor in
a tangle of arms and legs and at the
same instant the freezing paralysis that

had gripped laird suddenly was re-
leased

  he started for the heap of feminine
fury that was engaged on the floor but
one glance assured him his assistance
would be superfluous

  colette was already assuming com-
plete command seramidis might have
been a tough customer in her own
league but colette had learned the
womanly art of self defense from count-
less brushes with the wolves of holly-
wood and she had learned it thoroughly

  she had jammed her rivals face into
the suffocating depths of a huge pillow
by the simple expedient of sitting on
the back of her head with her knees
she had effected a doubled arm-lock on
the would-be empress of persia that
jim londos might have envied and
she had secured her opponents ankles
in her hands and was in the process of
bending seramidis into the shape of
dangerously tautened long-bow

  there was a muffled cry from the
depths of the pillow that might have
been interpreted a number of ways and
then all resistance ceased

  colette removed the slippers from
seramidis and was in the act of slipping
them on her own feet when laird hap-
pened to glance up just as raschid was
scuttling like a battered crab for the
doorway

  laird plunged after him but raschid
leaped to his feet and ran down the
corridor obviously uninterested in an-
other demonstration of the science of
the marquis of queensbury he reached
an open door before laird and was in
the act of slamming it shut when lairds
shoulder crashed against it with all of
his weight and speed

  the door flew inward and raschid
again landed on the floor

  laird risked a swift glance about the
sumptuously appointed chamber and
when he saw a small trussed figure


fantastic adventures

struggling on the bed he knew that he
had found gloria

  get up he said softly to raschid

  raschid climbed to his feet breath-
ing heavily	n

  laird moved in and pulled the trigger
on another right cross

  but raschid knew all about right
crosses now he had seen one he had
felt one in fact if asked he would prob-
ably have stated that he was authority
on all varities of the right cross

  but he knew nothing about the art
of feinting

  lairds right cross stopped in mid-
circuit raschid had thrown up a hand
to block it and to his consternation he
suddenly found himself vulnerable on
several other fronts

  laird took his time and snapped a
smoking left hook into the raschids
jowls the grand vizer howled wildly
and doubled up turning his back to
laird

  there was nothing left for laird to
do but blast away at the only target
available he drew back his foot and
kicked raschid with such force that
the grand vizer slid ten feet on his nose
across the smooth floor

  laird reached the huge bed in two
strides he quickly untied gloria and
removed the gag from her mouth she
was crying hysterically as he lifted her
in his arms and carried her out of the
room

  its all over honey he said sooth-
ingly everything is going to be all
right now he hoped so anyway

  she cried until he kissed her with
considerable thoroughness then she
melted into his arms and her blonde
head nestled comfortably against his
shoulder

  when they reached the chamber
where he had left colette he heard el
amos voice carrying into the corridor

  you are the most glorious woman

in the world the shah was blubbering
i cannot live without you you must
stay her with me always

  laird set gloria on her feet in the
corridor and then he tip-toed to the
drapery and peered into the room

  colette was standing in the center of
the room with her back to laird she
was wearing the ebony slippers sera-
midis was still lying on the floor at her
feet looking like a tired pretzel

  i think i am going to stay here
colette said in her cool speculative
voice there are jewels and wealth
and power here and with these slippers
ill rule all men thatll be kind of fun
ive already figured out a few paces i
want to put mr laird baxter through
thatll be the most fun of all yep
shah you can consider me a permanent
addition

  laird loosened his tight collar this
situation called for something drastic

  without wasting time on strategy he
stepped softly through the curtain and
moved across the floor until he was
standing directly behind colette

  he raised his fist then lowered it
no he couldnt do it he couldnt
slug a woman-not with her back
turned anyway

  colette darling he said

  she wheeled in surprise and before
she could utter a word he clipped her
neatly on the jaw with a punch that
hardly traveled six inches he caught
her as she fell and laid her gently on
the couch with a smile he removed
the slippers from her feet

  you wont need these to control
men he murmured to her unconscious
figure youve always done that with-
out benefit of magic

  he turned to el amo who was wring-
ing his hands and staring pitifully at
colettes still form

  shell be okay laird assured him
youd better put seramidis and ras-
trail of the magic slippers



chid on ice while theyre still groggy
when colette comes to give her my re-
gards and one more thing el amo-
yes

  laird studied the shahs round sad
face and then shook his head slowly
i was going to tell you too cheer up
that things were never as bad as they
seem but he glanced at colette and
shook his head somberly youd find
out soon enough that i was only kid-
ding

  he stepped back through the door-
way then and took gloria by the shoul-
ders were on our way he snapped
speed is of the essence

  he knelt and fastened the slippers
onto her bare feet

  now lets dance

  but laird gloria said there are
so many questions i want to ask every-
thing has been so strange and wild
what is this place where is it
how-

  later my pet laird said

giving plants

  american agricultural scientists have been
experimenting with the development of
 plants that insects dont like as a new
method of combating the great annual losses that
insects bring to the american farmer although
the insects will not touch the plants they are
still tasty and full of food-goodness for man
and animals who are to consume the plants as
food

   it was over a century ago that the first insect-
resistant plants were discovered and there were
a few scattered examples of farmers having suc-
cess with them however in the last few years
the entomologists and plant breeders have joined
forces to produce on a large scale plants that
can resist insects

  experimental stations were established in
california kansas indiana missouri wiscon-
sin texas oklahoma illinois and ohio to
make tests and develop plants that could grow
in their particular locality out of these sta-
tions have come such crops as alfalfa corn
wheat sorghum and onions which have been
produced with insect resistance the stations
have already released the seeds for most of
these new varieties and have recommended other

   he took her in his arms and began
 to whistle the blue danube waltz as
 they danced down the corridor when
 the cone of stars commenced to mat-
 erialize over their heads he felt a deep
 surge of relief and hope welling inside
 him they settled slowly in brilliant
 arcs of radiant fire and laird watched
 them happily

    a draft swirled under them billowing
  glorias skirt above her waist and she
  smiled in embarrassed confusion

    the draft of the suction grew steadily
  more powerful

   laird tightened his arm about
 glorias waist

    here we go honey he said

   where laird

   ill be damned if i know laird
 said cheerfully but were going to-
 gether

    they were smiling into each others
 eyes as the roaring suction crescendoed
 into a powerful roar in their ears   

the end

self-protection

  seeds produced by private farms a word of
  warning was issued by prof reginald h painter
  of kansas state agricultural college who cau-
  tioned farmers that they should not rely too
  much on the claims of seedsmen regarding insect
  resistance of various plant varieties unless these
  claims had been substantiated by a federal or
  state experimental station

     as yet little is known about the reasons for
  some plants being resistant while others are not
  the scientists do know that some insects get
  sick after feeding on other varieties and that
  some plants will continue to yield a crop even
  after being damaged by insects these char-
  acteristics of plants are inherited and they have
  been known to transfer them to another species
  as well as to another variety of the same species

     the basic idea behind developing insect resist-
  ant plants is to make the plants so distasteful to
  the insects that they would not eat the plants
  but would seek their nourishment elsewhere
  this method of plant protection will not replace
  the old methods such as using poison but will
  be used in conjunction with them to bring the
  insect problem under control for one and all-

by leslie owen

       this letter was delivered twenty years
       before it was written and it gave john
       morrison a choice between life and death

the first letter arrived with the	conventional existence for the first
morning mail november th	twenty-eight years of his life he had

bered that he had considered it a some-	in which he had been born and had

john morrison had led a completely	everything in his life had been quite


fantastic adventures

ordinary and normal and his entire ex-
istence was duplicated thousands of
times throughout the country by other
conventional middle-class families

  all things considered john morrison
was hardly the type of person who
should receive a letter dated twenty
years in the future

  and yet this is precisely what hap-
pened

  on the morning of november th
john morrison sat down to breakfast
and opened the paper with one hand
while he was stirring his coffee with
the other he did this every morning
of his life and he had achieved better-
than-average proficiency at this ma-
nipulation

  his two-year-old son bobby was
gurgling cheerfully in his high chair
and poking a spoonful of gruel at his
ear with one chubby fist

  mrs john morrison a pretty woman
of twenty-five came into the room from
the kitchen carrying her husbands
breakfast on a plate she set it before
him and took the spoon away from the
babys ear with practically the same
motion

  i do wish youd watch the baby
she said hes got oatmeal all over
his face now

  yes dear john said absently he
looked up from the paper and smiled at
his wife but it isnt every two-year-
old kid who feeds himself breakfast
do you think we ought to discourage
him by telling him that his ear isnt the
best place to put oatmeal

  oh fiddlesticks mrs morrison
said

  john reached across the table and
poked his son gently in the ribs

  whata you say this morning tough
guy he chuckled

  bobby aged two waved his fists in
little circles and gurgled happily

  hear that honey john looked

up at his wife beaming

  oh john every baby makes noises
like that she said but nevertheless
there was a bright look of pride on her
face

  not on your life john grinned
he looked at his son and a thoughtful
expression replaced his smile this
kid is going to have the best of every-
thing he said if things go right at
the store do you know what im going
to do im going to send him abroad
for his college education

  there are plenty of good colleges
right here in the united states his
wife said you got a good enough
education right here in your own coun-
try

  i know john said the thought-
ful expression drew lines in his fore-
head but i wanted to go abroad to
edinburgh i couldnt because there
just wasnt any money but if he
wants to go im going to see that hes
able to he leaned over and ruffled
his sons curly hair whata you say
to that tough guy

  well theres lots of time to talk
over his college education mrs mor-
rison said for gracious sakes hes
only a baby now finish your break-
fast youll be late opening up if you
dont hurry

john looked at the clock on the wall
and said holy smokes youre
right honey he finished his break-
fast quickly

  his wife was in the kitchen when he
reached the front door

  will you see if theres any mail
before you go she called

  okay he answered

  he wrapped his muffler about his
neck and stepped out into the cold
morning the mail box was at the end
of the walk leading from the porch to
the sidewalk there were three let-
tomorrows mail



ters two to his wife and one in an un-
familiar hand addressed to himself

  john returned to the house and left
his wifes letters on the sewing table in
the living room his own letter he put
in his pocket to read when he reached
his store

  bye honey he called

  was there any mail

  yes two for you i left em on
the sewing table

  for some reason he did not mention
his own letter there was nothing un-
usual about this but later he thought
about it and wondered

  when he reached his store his clerk
had already opened up and was busy
putting new stock away on the shelves
john said good morning to him and
went to his small office at the rear of
the store to remove his overshoes and
coat there were several invoices on
his desk and he checked through them
carefully before he remembered his
letter which he had left in his over-
coat pocket

  he fished into the coat pocket for the
letter and then sat down at his desk
he snapped on the small desk light and
lit a cigarette then he turned his
attention to the letter

  almost half of the envelope was cov-
ered with stamps and he felt a pleasant
flutter of excitement when he saw that
the letter was postmarked with a for-
eign stamp

  who could be writing to him from a
foreign country

  looking closely at the blurred stamp
mark he made out the word scot-
land but the name of the village from
which the letter had been mailed was
too blurred to be recognizable

  john felt his excitement increasing
and he experienced a sensation of pe-
culiar bewilderment he had never in
his life received a letter from scotland
how could he when he didnt know a

soul there

  he opened the letter carefully and
spread it flat on the desk putting on
his glasses he picked up the letter
leaned back in his chair and read the
large masculine script that covered the
page

  the letter was not long he read it
twice in less than a minute but when
he put the letter back down on his
desk there was a hard set to his lips
and his normally cheerful face was
flushed with anger

   the letter that produced this effect
on john morrison was remarkable in
several aspects it was dated in this
manner edinburgh scotland no-
vember th 

  the opening salutation was dear
dad

   and the letter read as follows

  thanks for your letter and espe-
cially the enclosed check it certainly
relieved the pressure thanks again
you may bet your life im going to be
more economical in the future i know
how hard youre working to keep me
over here and although i dont always
show it i appreciate it very much im
doing well in my studies and am feeling
fine please give my love to mother
and tell her vm writing also thank
her for the shirts they are fine this
will be all for now but i will write you
soon and at greater length all my love
to both of you

                     your son

bob

t ohn morrison stood up and his
j hands were trembling he didnt
know why he should be so enraged at
this stupid crude practical joke but
he was he felt a blinding anger to-
vard whomever had written this letter
and dropped it into his mail box

  there were some things that were
close and almost sacred to a man and


fantastic adventures

such was john morrisons desire to
send his young son abroad for his
schooling possibly his attitude was
silly and illogical but he felt that this
preposterous letter was in the very
worst of taste

  every man has some private per-
sonal hope some cherished desire
locked deep in him and john morrison
felt this letter which was patently ridi-
culing his dream for his sons educa-
tion was unfair and cruel

  john morrison did not boast of his
intention to send his son abroad to
college in the first place he realized
that it was in itself nothing in par-
ticular to brag about secondly the
subject was close and important to him
and he would have felt strangely sacri-
legious had he disclosed his secret
dream to his friends and cronies

  he had mentioned it to his wife this
morning but as far as he could re-
member she was the only person to
whom he had confided his intention

  a puzzled frown settled slowly above
his eyes as he thought of this he
looked at the letter again and then
sat down heavily at his desk

  who could have written this letter
who possibly could have known of his
plan to send bobby to edinburgh he
racked his brain for several moments
trying to think of some occasion when
he might have let it slip to someone
but he could think of no occasion or
of no person to whom he had ever told
his dreams

  that made the entire situation all the
more bewildering for several mo-
ments he sat at his desk a frown on
his face studying the peculiar letter

  finally he decided to investigate the
matter slipping into his coat he left
the store and walked directly to the
office of the local post office

  charley higgins the postmaster was
seated behind the wire grill-work that

enclosed the various mail bins he was
a small gray-haired man with bright
blue eyes protected by a green eye-
shade which no one had ever seen him
without

  john had known him all his life and
he knew he could trust the old mans
sense of discretion he didnt want this
thing blabbed about the town

  what can i do for you johnnie
charley asked in his high piping voice
hows the missus and the youngster
just fine john answered i just
want a little information about a letter
i got today i think its some kind of
a joke

  he shoved the envelope across the
counter the old man picked it up and
studied it carefully

  what is it you want to know he
said this here letter was mailed from
scotland and-

  look at the date john said

  the postmaster raised his eyeshade
and lifted the letter to the light

 well i swan he murmured

nineteen sixty-two november fif-
teenth if that dont beat all he
peered up at john sharply whend
you get this

  today john said it was with
the morning mail

  hmmm charley said thought-
fully he stood up and shuffled across
to a file in the rear of the office after
a few minutes of sifting through pa-
pers and records he turned back to
john and there was a puzzled look in
his eye

  dang funny he said every bit
of mail from overseas that comes
through here is recorded but there aint
no record of this letter ever being in
this office are you sure it didnt come
special delivery

  positive it was with the regular
mail im sure now that somebody
just dropped it in the box as a gag
tomorrows mail



rjphe postmaster picked up the letter
again and studied it thoughtfully
then he looked up at john and shook
his head slowly

  it might be a joke he said but
if it is somebody in scotland is play-
ing the joke this here letter was
mailed from edinburgh cause it was
canceled there the date nineteen
sixty-two was just probably a mistake
on the part of postal clerk

  john morrison felt a peculiar sensa-
tion of panic

  are you sure he demanded are
you absolutely sure that this letter was
mailed from scotland

  aint no doubt of it charley hig-
gins said emphatically but i cant
understand how it got through this of-
fice theres something fishy about
that i should have a record of it but
i aint and i cant figure out who de-
livered it the regular mailman didnt
thats a cinch if you get any more
letters like this i wish youd let me
know

  yes i will john morrison said
slowly

  dang funny charley muttered
shaking his head but lots of funny
things happen in the mail business
yes i suppose they do john said
give my regards to the missus will
you charley said and say hello to
that youngster of yours for me hes
getting to be a fine big boy now be
ready for college soon figured out
yet where youll send him

  john morrison ran a hand wearily
through his hair

  no he said i havent got the
faintest idea

  he moved toward the door with slow
heavy steps

  well lots of time for that charley
called after him see you around
john

  john opened the door and stepped

into the raw wind his hands deep in
the pockets of his coat were closed
about the envelope and the letter he
had received from edinburgh that
morning he walked on for several
blocks hardly realizing that he was
walking in the wrong direction

  when he finally saw his error he
stopped and started back toward the
store on the way he tore the en-
velope and letter into small bits and
dropped them in an ashcan

  ive got too much on my mind he
said aloud to be worrying about a
stupid practical joke

  and he decided to forget all about it

jhat evening after one of his wifes
excellent dinners he settled down
to read the evening papers but for
some reason he found himself tense
and nervous

  his son bobby was crawling about
the floor and john morrison found his
eyes straying to the boy with a curious
questioning

  john dear his wife said patiently
i dont know when ive seen you so
jumpy she was sitting on the oppo-
site side of the room knitting and her
eyes met his worriedly

  john hadnt told her about the letter
im all right he said irritably he
snapped off the radio with a sudden
vicious gesture these commenta-
tors he muttered the heroes of
blatton thats what they are he
stood up and let the paper fall to the
floor

  now john his wife said worried-
ly you always listen to the war news
after dinner whats the matter with
you tonight did something go wrong
at work today youre just letting
your nerves run away with you

  ill be all right he said im go-
ing for a walk

  he walked steadily for two hours


fantastic adventures

letting the harsh raw wind break
against his face and there was some-
thing in its stinging cleanness that
washed away his worry and fear and
gave him a peace and calmness of mind
when he returned home he felt infi-
nitely relieved and he knew now that
he would be able to dismiss forever the
worrying nagging doubts that had tor-
mented him all the day

  he didnt know from where the let-
ter had come he probably never would
know but he was not going to worry
about it any more this time he told
himself he was really going to forget
all about it and thinking this he
went to bed

  it is quite likely that john morrison
would have been able to erase from his
consciousness the memory of that cu-
rious letter if it hadnt been for just
one phenomenal circumstance

  and that circumstance was this the
following morning there was another
letter in the mail box addressed to john
morrison and postmarked edinburgh
scotland

tanding in front of his house
with the letter in his hand he was
oblivious to the cutting wind that
shipped the ends of his scarf about his
face and stung his cheeks

  he felt nothing but the slight weight
of the letter in his fingers he saw
nothing but the heavily stamped care-
fully addressed envelope with his name
written in a bold masculine hand and
the unmistakable postmark edinburgh
scotland

  the handwriting he recognized as
being identical with the address on the
first letter there was no doubt in his
mind of that both letters had been
written by the same hand

  yesterday his reaction had been in-
stant and angry today he knew noth-
ing but a vast feeling of insecurity and

doubt with a baffled shake of his
head he stuffed the letter into the
pocket of his coat and walked slowly
down the street

  when he reached his store he opened
the envelope and spread the letter on
his desk precisely as he had done the
day before it was dated february
 the first letter had been dated
november th  the salutation
was dear dad

  the letter longer than the first fol-
lowed

  please forgive me for not writing
oftener and at greater length but the
press of work sometimes makes it im-
possible but today i have an unex-
pected afternoon to myself and i in-
tend to catch up on my correspondence
to you first you will i hope be
pleased to know that my studies are
progressing very satisfactorily i have
received good grades in history eng-
lish economics and to my own sur-
prise my math grades have been bet-
ter than average you remember the
difficulty i had with geometry and al-
gebra dont you well in spite of all
that i am sailing through trig and
calculus without much trouble i cant
figure it out but im keeping my fin-
gers crossed your letters are the
bright spots of the week for me they
almost make me homesick i was very
pleased to hear that you are thinking of
retiring of all people i know yo de-
serve a good rest the most you hint
that you might come over for a visit
when and if you sell out your interests
that would be wonderful there are
many things here i would enjoy show-
ing you but most of all i would like to
see you and talk to you again i cant
imagine anything that would make me
happier wasnt it fortunate that you
went into partnership with mr hallick
twenty or so years ago of course you
had all the brains and would have been
tomorrows mail



a success at anything you touched but
he had the capital to give you a flying
start just think youre retiring and
preparing to enjoy a leisurely existence
at an age when most men are settling
down for another ten or fifteen years
john morrison lifted his eyes from
the letter and his mind performed a
mental calculation twenty-eight now
and twenty years more would make him
forty-eight that was a wonderful age
to be able to retire suddenly he shook
his head what was he thinking this
letter-this preposterous hoax-
couldnt have any basis in reality he
was letting himself be carried away by
his own wishes and dreams quickly
he scanned the letter obviously it was
a fraud the mention of a mr hallick
with whom he was supposed to have
gone into partnership proved that fact
there never was and never would be a
mr hallick john read the last lines
of the letter with some of the bitter-
ness he had felt the day before

      and please give all my love to
mother hope you both can make the
trip over this spring

                    all my love

bob

  john morrison was scowling as he
finished these last lines someone
somehow was sending him these let-
ters but the purpose behind them was
unfathomable why anyone should go
to the trouble of perpetrating such a
stupid silly joke was beyond him

  carefully he tore the letter and en-
velope into bits and dropped them into
his wastebasket but he could not dis-
pose of his worrying thoughts quite that
easily for the rest of the morning he
sat at his desk trying in vain to an-
swer the questions that crowded his
mind

a t noon his clerk appeared at the
 door

  theres a man here wants to talk
to you mr morrison he said

to see me john looked up in
surprise who is he a customer
no he dont want to buy nothing
he just said he wanted to talk to you
i never saw him before in my life
all right ill see him john said
he walked from his small cubby-hole
of an office into the main section of the
store and saw a tall well-dressed man
of perhaps forty years standing in the
aisle staring interestedly at the various
items on the shelf

  what can i do for you john
asked

  the man turned at the sound of
johns voice and he smiled warmly
are you john morrison he asked
thats right john said but i
dont believe i know you

  you dont the man said he
chuckled but you can relax im
not a life insurance salesman id like
to talk to you for a few minutes if you
have the time

  john found himself liking the man
there was something in his lean good-
humored face that was intrinsically
honest and his keen blue eyes were
straight and unwavering

  he smiled and said fire away
im not busy right now

  ill be as brief as possible the
stranger said i know considerable
about you john morrison ive gone
to the trouble to look you up i know
that youve made a success out of this
business and i think you know your
line of work completely

  why all the interest in me john
asked

  i want to offer you a proposition
its my opinion that this state has in-
sufficient retail hardware outlets and
that there is a definite reward waiting
the man who will merchandise this lo-
cality properly do you agree


fantastic adventures

  generally speaking yes john said
slowly he was puzzled

  im in a position to back my opin-
ions with capital the stranger said
in short i intend to establish several
retail outlets similar to yours right here
in various strategically located towns
throughout the state you have the
practical experience in this line that i
do not my offer to you is this come
in with me on a fifty-fifty proposition
i need a man of your experience and
with my capital i think we will make a
good thing out of it

  johns heart was pounding heavily
a numbing excitement gripped him and
his thoughts flashed to the letter he had
just read

  your name is mr hallick he said
slowly

  thats right the stranger said
he smiled in a puzzled fashion but
how did you know

  i-i dont know john said he
touched his fingers to his forehead and
a wondering light was mirrored in his
eyes

  possibly weve met before mr
hallick said although i dont remem-
ber any such meeting but that is un-
important what do you think of my
offer naturally i dont expect an an-
swer immediately i want you to think
this over carefully and investigate all
the angles before you make any deci-
sions

john morrison hardly heard the
j words his mind was seething with
crazy tumbling thoughts the letter
he had just torn to bits the letter signed
with his sons name had mentioned this
mr hallick and their partnership-
but it was impossible no one in the
world had known ten minutes ago of
this meeting he himself had never
heard of the man and until this in-
stant he had never even considered the

idea of a partnership

  but someone had known of it some-
one had known just as that someone
had known of his plans to send bobby
to edinburgh someone had known

  is anything the matter mr hal-
lick asked solicitiously you look as
if youve received a shock can i get
something for you

  no-no that wont be necessary
john said weakly ill-ill be all
right

  im glad to hear it mr hallick
said you gave me a bit of a turn
ill be all right john repeated
dully

  now as to my offer mr hallick
said i want you to consider every-
thing carefully and-

  john looked at mr hallick

  i think your offer is very interest-
ing he said he extended his hand
youve got yourself a partner

  mr hallick smiled with pleased sur-
prise

  naturally im delighted he said
heartily i dont want to rush you
but im happy that you are able to
make a quick decision if there are
any questions youd like to discuss-
weirwork everything out satisfac-
torily john said i think were go-
ing to do all right he smiled slowly
and his thoughts were far away in
fact ill probably be able to retire in
about twenty years he murmured

jutis wife trusted his judgment com-
pletely but she was still consider-
ably puzzled by the abruptness of the
move

  but john she said that night after
they had put bobby to bed youve
been doing very well for yourself are
you sure youre doing just right going
in with this man after all you dont
know a thing about him

  i know all i need to know honey
tomorrows mail



he patted her hand and smiled ive
got a little inside dope on mr hallick
were going to do great things together
dont worry about that

  you know your business she said
and im glad you feel youre doing the
right thing i wouldnt mind taking a
chance for ourselves but weve got
bobby to think of she smiled
youve got expensive plans in mind
for him you know school in edin-
burgh will come pretty high wont it
im not worried a bit about that
john said he looked at her seriously
bobby is going to edinburgh for his
college schooling and he suddenly
chuckled ill tell you something else
what

  john morrison lit a cigar and leaned
back smiling at his wife

  hes not going to have trouble with
his math

considering the placid com-
mon-place existence john morri-
son had led his acceptance of two let-
ters from the future was rather remark-
able had he been a scientist he would
have known that such a thing was im-
possible had he been a small suspi-
cious person he would have gone
through life believing those letters to
have been the product of some practi-
cal joker

  but possibly faith consists of believ-
ing in things our reason tells us is im-
possible and so john morrison be-
lieved that in some incomprehensible
manner he had actually received two
letters which his son would not write
for twenty odd years

  however he did make an effort to
discover if such a thing were at all com-
patible with normal physical laws the
next morning after looking carefully
in the mail-box and finding nothing he
went directly to the public library and
with the aid of the librarian selected

a half dozen thick volumes on the gen-
eral topics of time and space

  he spent the day poring over their
dusty pages the terminology he
found difficult to interpret and most of
the writings were cloudy and muddled
but when he finally finished the last
book he had convinced himself of one
fact

  no one apparently knew a great deal
about the cosmic implications of time
and space at least even the most
learned of savants were at times at op-
posite poles in their conclusions in re-
gard just what were the laws govern-
ing time and space

  some insisted that the terms were
inter-changable that they were ac-
tually one and the same thing others
argued with much multi-syllabic weight
that time was curved and space infi-
nite while still another school frowned
at this conception and insisted that
precisely the opposite was true

  john morrison shoved the books
away with a sigh their learned squab-
blings led to an inevitable question
mark why was the theory so impor-
tant why to him anyway he had
one fact to advance against all the the-
orizing ever set in print he had ac-
tually received letters from the future
the contents of the second letter spe-
cifically the reference to mr hallick
was proof conclusive that the letters
had been written in the future

  that was a fact and one fact was
worth all the fancy theories in the
world and thus john morrison satis-
fied his mind with a simple and yet
beautifully logical solution to all the
torturing questions that had arisen
since the arrival of the first letter from
his son in scotland

  he lit a cigar and contemplated the
future with contentment as the smoke
curled in slow lazy wreaths about his
head he wondered if he were going to


fantastic adventures

visit bobby in edinburgh when he re-
tired what a kick hed get out of
that

geveral weeks passed during
which john morrison worked four-
teen hours a day making all the many
arrangements necessitated by the new
partnership

  every morning he looked carefully
into the mail box but there were no
more letters from the future john was
not exactly dissappointed but he did
feel a strange hope that there would be
more letters

  and as events proved this hope of
his was not in vain

  the third letter arrived on a sunday
morning john morrison had finished
a leisurely comfortable breakfast and
he was preparing to enjoy this his first
day of relaxation in weeks when a cu-
rious urge prompted him to see if there
was any mail

  there was no regular mail delivery
on sunday but john was not thinking
of the regular mail

  he was sitting on the front porch
wearing a light sweater for the weather
had warmed pleasantly and there was
a bracing wine-like invigoration to the
air his wife was at church and bobby
was playing on the sidewalk with his
wagon

  john kept an eye on the youngster
as he glanced through the sunday pa-
per he could see his blonde head of
curls through the picket fences and
hear his piping cries of delight as he
coasted back and forth in front of the
house on his little wagon

  finally he set aside the paper and
walked down to the mail box he
opened the small door and saw the let-
ter and instantly a thrill of excitement
shot through him he saw that the
letter was covered with foreign stamps
and was postmarked in the same man-

ner that the others had been

  bobby coasted by and shouted glee-
fully when he saw his father

  john smiled down at the excited
red-cheeked youngster

  stay out of the street son he said
just play here on the sidewalk

  with a whoop bobby coasted away
propelling the wagon with short chubby
legs

  john returned to the porch with the
letter in his hand he sat down to
read it but then he noticed a peculiar
thing this letter was different in one
respect from the others he had re-
ceived it was not addressed to him
but to his wife he studied the ad-
dress carefully frowning there was
no doubt of it mrs john morrison
was written plainly and unmistakably
on the envelope in the same hand that
had addressed the other letters

  john morrison hadnt told his wife
of the two letters hed received and now
he didnt know quite what to do if
he showed her this one he would have
to tell her about the others and he
knew that she would be terribly upset
over the whole thing

  he decided to continue his decep-
tion

  opening the letter he saw that it was
dated may th  the salutation
was dear mother

  john felt slightly guilty reading his
wifes mail but under the circum-
stances he was able to assuage his con-
science before starting the letter he
glanced up to see that bobby hadnt
gotten himself into any trouble and
when he saw that the youngster was still
coasting on the sidewalk he spread the
letter in his lap and began reading

  these last jew weeks have been ter-
rible mother and i know that your
heart must be breaking too somehow
i find it impossible to believe that dad
is dead i wake up in the middle of
tomorrows mail



the night hearing his voice plainly and
his image seems to be before my eyes-
and then i realize that i have been
dreaming sometimes it seems more
than i can stand

  john morrison read these lines with
an incredulous sense of horror the
words seemed to stand out in fiery red
against the whiteness of the page
dead no there was some mon-
strous mistake it couldnt be true
but with a terrible feeling of inescap-
a b  e immutable inevitableness he
knew that this letter from the future
this prophecy of doom from the cosmic
reaches of un-born time was stating a
fact as unalterable as fate as inevitable
as the very depths of time and space it
had somehow bridged

a cold rim of ice seemed to be
forming about his heart he
forced his glazed eyes back to the page
the letter continued

 under any circumstances of
course his death would have saddened
me terribly but the realization that it
was i who was responsible for his
death makes it absolutely unbearable
i know what you will say it was an
accident it might have happened to
anyone and that he himself would
never blame me in the least ive said
all these things to myself but they dont
do any good it was my fault that he
died the fact that it was an accident
doesnt make it any easier for me
john morrison raised his stricken
eyes from the letter there was a
ghastly nausea creeping over him and
his forehead was wet with a cold sweat
he could hear as if from a great dis-
tance the gleeful shouts of his son
playing on the walk his hands hold-
ing the letter were as cold and stiff as
pieces of wood

  this letter was his death sentence
as inescapably as if it had come from

the hand of a judge ordering his exe-
cution

  and in some manner his son
bobby was to be cast in the role of
executioner that thought was even
more horrible than the realization of
his own death for john morrison was
not thinking of himself but of his son
death came to every man and must be
borne but bobbys life might be for-
ever twisted and distorted by the
knowledge that he was responsible for
his fathers accidental death

  john morrison knew what he must
do in the years to come armed with
this fore-knowledge of events he would
carefully and subtly condition his son
with a philosophy that would sustain
him in his black moments of torment
and guilt

  this thought was not expressed and
definite it was simply an automatic
and instinctive reaction to the heart-
rending piteous anguish of his son that
was visible through the cold barren
words of the letter

  he turned his attention again to the
letter

  -somehow it seems additionally
hard to bear when i realize how much
dad always did for me his advice
and encouragement did much to keep
my chin up when things were not go-
ing -well perhaps even in this black-
est hour of my life the lessons that he
taught me will come to my aid and see
me through

  john morrison smiled good boy
he whispered

 -do you remember the time
mother when i was struck by the atu-
tomobile dad saved my life that time
with his quick thinking as surely as i
cost him his by my clumsiness 

  john morrison wondered fleetingly
of the manner of his death perhaps
his son jostled him on a crowded train
platform perhaps it would be a boat-


fantastic adventures

ing accident somehow it didnt seem
to matter

  -many times i have thought and
wondered about that accident if i
hadnt been gotten immediately to a
doctor i would have certainly died
and that is what always struck me as
being peculiar how did dad know
that doctor masterson was not at his
office but out at the smith home on an
emergency if he had taken me to his
office first it would have been too late
 would have been dead before the doc-
tor could have been reached doctor
masterson told me that much later
but how did dad know-

a shrieking wail of protesting
brakes tore his attention from the
letter a car had come to an abrupt
stop before the house the driver was
scrambling from behind the wheel a
white scared look on his face

  john sprang to his feet and his heart
was hammering with a terrible fear
god he whispered

  he ran across the lawn to the street
like a madman the driver of the car
was kneeling beside a small still figure
an expression of sick horror on his face

  he ran right in front of me he said
in a hoarse shaken voice i didnt
have a chance to stop

  bobby john cried he knelt be-
side the pitifully small figure and cried
again bobby

  the small soft features were per-
fectly calm there was a dark ugly
bruise at the left temple from which
dark blood oozed slowly the frail
little body was lying on its side like a
broken doll that had been cast heed-
lessly aside

  the driver of the car was hanging on

johns arm

  we got to get him to a doctor he
cried hes hurt bad i didnt have
a chance to stop he cried frantically
we got to get him to doc mastersons
hes at his office now well take my
car

  well get him to doctor masterson
all right john morrison said turn
your car around he ordered in a quiet
voice everything is going to be all
right well take him over to bill
smiths home on terrace street thats
where the doc is

  youre out of your head the driver
of the car said wildly the docs at
his office what makes you think hes
at the smith place

  turn your car around john mor-
rison repeated i know what im do-
ing

  he cradled his sons small body in
his arms and carried him to the car a
peculiar thought occurred to him as he
gently laid his son on the soft rear seat
of the car if he had gone to the doc-
tors office bobby would surely have
died but he himself would have lived
beyond that day in the distant future
when his son a grown man would be
responsible for his death

  the thought brought a smile to his
face

  everythings going to be all right
tough guy he murmured to his son
to the driver he said drive like hell
to bill smiths

  on the way john morrison tore a
certain letter into small pieces and let
them float out the window of the car
somehow he knew that this would be
the last letter from tomorrow that he
would receive and in that he was
right

for the best in science fiction-amazing stories

the author

h b carleton

 author of they gave him a rope

t was born in cleveland ohio on june 
 im -a in the draft and -f with my
wife my three children havent classified me
yet-but they will

  the first fiction ive sold appeared in amaz-
ing stories a few months back it was a
short-short called hard guy which as far
as i can find out no one read oh well   

  my childhood wasnt exceptional in any way
i got through grammar and high schools with
the maximum amount of effort played basket-
ball in high school well enough to have a few
of the pupils regard me warmly and slid grace-
fully into ohio state university i had my
eye on vassar but nothing ever came of it

  four years of university classes gave me an
excellent business training and i found work
loading trucks for a large cleveland department
store this job lasted four years too and i
learned more at it than i did in the university
by the time i left i had attained a position that
permitted me to load little packages on the trucks
while somebody else handled the big ones and
if you think that isnt a degree of success youve
never worked in a shipping room

  afterwards i went to work in an insurance
office as a rate clerk im still with the same
company but with a better job when i was
pretty sure i would be able to eat regularly on
my salary i asked a girl to marry me she was
getting tired of her mothers cooking anyway
so she said yes after marrying me she got
tired of not eating anyones cooking but she
stuck it out the children are glad   

  writing sort of sneaked up on me the edi-
tor of the house organ of the insurance com-
pany asked me for an article on one particular
subject with which i am familiar it wasnt easy
to do and for anyone not interested in the sub-
ject about the driest reading matter imaginable
but the editor liked it-funny guys editors-
and he asked for others later i discovered
that trade journals would pay money for au-
thoritative articles on pertinent subjects so i
used the public library for material sources put
it together in my own words-and got paid for
it our landlord began to say good morning

when he met me in the hall and the installment

collector stopped coming around every week
money may not be pretty but its very useful
or did you know

  ive been an avid reader of pulp magazines
for a long time about a year ago i who felt
i was already an author-trade journals you
know-said i can write better fiction than
these guys these guys as i remember were
writers like richard sale erie stanley gardner
and frank gruber

  so i did-and i didnt i wrote the fiction
all right and it was better-better that is than
kids in the sixth grade could do and there
seems to be some doubt about the last part of
that

  jack woodfords book put my feet on the
right trail i mean his writing and selling
which has more common sense about writing
between its covers than anything you ever heard
of i tried the syndicate field for a while and
managed to sell a dozen or so a few months
ago i picked up a copy of amazing stories
read it said now heres something i can
write the first two i sent that editor came
back-but fast the next a short-short made
the grade the next two bounced-it hurts worse
to draw rejects from a market youve made a
sale to-and then the one which appears in this
issue managed to stick in fact mr palmer
wrote me a very flattering letter asking for
more material of its caliber and if you think
a letter like that isnt something to treasure
youve just never received one thats all

  i doubt if ill ever be able to quit my job
and become a professional writer it takes me
quite a while to finish a story and from what i
hear youve got to be able to knock em out
quick to make enough for a penthouse and a
valet

  i intend to keep sending stories to this maga-
zine i wont sell em all i know but if you
see one under my name now and then one of
us is going to feel pretty good

  i sure hope you like this one

could it be alive how could it
keep on growing
the black
brain

by tarleton fiske

t tes brought me a brain hil-
  i i ton whispered a black
  a -brain

  i stared into that cold grey face and
wondered what madness lurked beneath
the intensity of his eyes

  think of it hilton mumbled a
black brain from mars

  i thought of it and turned away my
own eyes stared at the grinning faces
of the shrunken dworp-heads from ju-
piter that hung from the walls at the
colossal skeleton of the giant qtella

from the saturnic ooze

  it was a long moment before i could
look at dennis hilton again he was
smiling he hugged his triumph gloated
over it chuckled again

  a black brain he crooned a
brain from mars

  i thought vaguely of calling a physi-
cian but you dont easily question
the sanity of a man like dennis hil-
ton-the uranium king himself-
the famous interplanetary financier
thats what the telepapers called him

not only wa the brain alive
and growing it wat powerful
it would have to be destroyed


fantastic adventures

thats what the public thought he was
i suppose i am one of the few friends
who know him in his true guise as a
man with an obsession you couldnt
call it a hobby really dennis hilton
had an actual passion for collecting

  we sat now in his private sanctum
sanctum more truthfully it was hil-
tons private museum all around the
vast chamber were the trophy-cases
the wall chests the display tables hold-
ing hiltons prizes

  jewels from the martian deserts
stuffed ekis from venus mummified
dringi from the caves on the dark side
of the moon    pottery from vlak-
ka statuary from the crypts of ignis
rare parchments found in the seas of
yabar osseous geologic paleonto-
logical remains    fragments of the
forgotten cultures of a dozen planets
   plunder from half a hundred as-
teroids and a score of satellites   
and now dennis hilton sitting there
before me and mumbling he brought
me a black brain from mars

  i snapped out of it

  wait a minute now i said you
flashed me in such a hurry i didnt get
a chance to ask any questions you
told me nothing when i landed on the
roof all ive managed to get out of
you here is something about securing
a black brain lets start at the begin-
ning shall we

tennis hilton sat back lighted
a sybarette and smiled in a mo-
ment the mask of self-consciousness
slipped over his heavy sagging grey
face he was once again the financier
the authority the man of the cosmos

  sorry he apologized with a
chuckle as ingenuous as it was false
guess im a little excited thats all
as one collector to another-you un-
derstand

  i collect facts i told him dryly

im just an author not a uranium
king and so far i havent heard any
facts

  allow me to remedy that said hil-
ton to begin with i got the brain
from arnold kress

  you got the brain from who i
exploded

  arnold kress hilton repeated
the name with a smile of triumph yes
i know how peculiar that must sound
kress and i have been rivals for years
business rivals-and rivals in our hob-
by as well hes always had the jump
on me too as owner of transplan-
etary incorporated he has been able to
organize his own private expeditions
to mars the moon venus and all
points solar always coming back with
ridiculous televisual poses showing him
standing there with a new trophy tucked
under one arm

  as for me you know how ive gone
about my collecting the skippers of
my own fleet have to pick up the items
for me ive sent out my own private
archeologists and planeticians too but
kress has always been able to lord it
over me because he bagged his own
trophies as it were

  i held up my hand and halted his
tirade

  i know all this i said get to the
point why did arnold kress honor
you with this gift and where did he
get it

  he got it on mars and he gave it
to me because he was afraid hilton
replied

  afraid afraid of what

  youll see soon enough hilton told
me but first you wanted facts kress
went out about three months ago some
operator of his up near dalil gave him
the tip you know the dalil deserts
beyond the great chasm

  dangerous territory isnt it un-
explored
the black brain



  right that only made kress keener
to be the first as i understand it his
expedition was very elaborately organ-
ized he made the desert crossing all
right got to the caves beyond
what caves

  the caves where he found the brain
claims to have discovered a totally new
lost martian civilization there noth-
ing alive you understand but remnants
of immense ethnological value quite
a contribution to interplanetary history
and culture as he tells it some of his
professorial hirelings are probably writ-
ing up his findings for monographs

  but all kress actually achieved was
the discovery of the brain it was sit-
ting in the cave ive tried to get fur-
ther details from him but hes devilishly
reticent not only reticent but fright-
ened

  frightened

  yes again hilton chuckled im-
agine that-a big bad interplanetary
buccaneer like arnold kress afraid of
his own shadow and admitting it to
me his rival

  facts i prompted him

  there arent many more from
hints kress dropped his expedition
left the caves beyond the great chasm
in something of a hurry several men
seem to have died in the dalil desert
crossing the voyage back was some-
thing of an ordeal too it seems fever
got two of his staff planeticians-i
gather it was the two who were as-
signed to tend and study the black
brain

  study it

  well get to that also hlton told
me at any rate when kress re-
turned he was a frightened man
whether he had some idea that the
black brain was a jinx in the way that
ancient egyptologists thought mummies
were hoodoos i dont know when he
came to me he merely offered me the

black brain but he seemed quite sin-
cere in warning me that the thing
seemed bewitched he said he wished
he had never removed it from its cave
in fact he went further than that and
said he is going to give up collecting
and by no means will he ever make
another expedition to mars

  where is he now i asked

  he went up to his private estate to
recuperate under the care of a physi-
cian personally i think arnold kress
is a sick man i believe his present
attitude-his delusions about the brain
-spring from a serious ailment frank-
ly some of the things he said to me
werent exactly sane

j rose to my feet

    you know what youve doing to
me dont you i asked hilton
youre giving me the most damnable
itch to see this black brain of yours
all this romantic buildup and air of
mystery

  come on then hilton urged ill
let you peek at it but i warn you
youre due for a shock

  dennis hilton led the way down the
long hall he paused before the bronze
doors of a further chamber and
knocked

  kiti answered his summons and
opened the door

  i shouldnt mention kiti i suppose
but that no longer matters now kiti
was a berian-a venusian from the
warm cities despite interplanetary
codes on immigration dennis hilton
had smuggled him in as a personal ser-
vant berians as all reports show
make the best of all possible servants
combining dog-like docility with utter
devotion to their masters hilton was
a man who liked unquestioning obedi-
ence hence kiti

  still i got a shock when he opened
the door you never get used to a


fantastic adventures

berian it isnt their faces though the
single eye is bad enough its that
greenish complexion the dwarfed
stooping posture and the claw-like fin-
gers that arouse some instinctive repul-
sion in all earth-dwellers

  yess hissed kiti

  were going to look at the brain
said hilton

  he moved forward but kiti didnt
get out of the doorway

  here now hilton snapped

  please please master do not
enter here the soft servile voice
held a note of entreaty

  whats this asked hilton in gen-
uine astonishment

  please do not go to the brain the
brain wants you to go it is not well
to obey it please do not go to the
brain

  berians hilton muttered to me
under his breath excellent servants
but really little better than cretins ac-
cording to earth standards they get
these delusions

  he shouldered the little green man
aside

  this way he called i followed
him into another room it was a room
id never seen before-or had i of
course this had once been a guest
chamber parlor and bedroom now
its walls were tiled antiseptically white
it looked like a surgical theater or a
scientific laboratory laboratory but
why

  we went towards the second door

  hilton turned a face filled with tri-
umph towards me

  here it is he whispered exultantly
the black brain from mars

  i stepped into that room i stared
at that table i gazed at that great in-
verted glass bell suspended on chains
from the high ceiling i gazed into
that bell

  i saw the black brain

  i screamed

  the transparent glass bell  it
was hanging from the ceiling on the
chains like a huge bowl ten feet wide
and within the crystal prison strands
of ebon horror clawing inkily in a fran-
tic effort to escape was the living
throbbing pulsating midnight mass of
the black brain

  its alive i gasped

jjilton turned to me his cold
grey face held a mocking grin

  thats the surprise i promised you
thats the best fact of all isnt it
the brain is alive yes alive

  i forced myself to stare again at the
serpentine horror to my trembling
gaze it looked like a medusas nest-
like an octopus-like an ever-changing
blob of monstrous protoplasmic slime
-like anything but a brain

  can you conceive of the organism
that once held this encased in a sen-
tient skull hilton gloated what
manner of being could control and be
controlled by this brain

  it was a question i didnt want to
ponder on and there were other ques-
tions equally pressing and equally un-
pleasant

  i couldnt hold back the obvious
one however

  what keeps it alive i asked

  i stared searching vainly for clamps
sutures for an electro-attachment such
as surgeons use in keeping animal
brains alive there was nothing nor
did there seem to be any saline solu-
tion in the clear shallow watery liquid
at the bottom of the inverted glass
compartment

  i dont know exactly hilton an-
swered my question slowly arnold
kress found it this way or says he did
the brain was in the cave in a bowl
-this bowl to be exact

  let me get this straight i said
the black brain



kress discovers this bowl in a cave
beyond the great chasm of mars sit-
ting all alone in the ruins of a bygone
civilization no one to tend to it- no
evidence as to how it got there no clue
as to why it managed to stay-alive-
if it is alive thats pretty hard to
swallow

  for answer hilton pointed to the
black blob behind the glass

  there it is he whispered

  and there it was throbbing cease-
lessly its nerve-endings undulating like
tentacles the black brain seethed

  are you sure its a brain i asked
how do you know it isnt some weird
ultra-terrestial life form some macro-
cosmic cell or a sea denizen

  look at the convolutions in the
mass hilton unconsciously assumed
a lecturing attitude as he walked
around the suspended glass bowl here
is a definite line of demarcation be-
tween the cerebrum and cerebellum
and note the prominence of what is
unmistakably the medulla oblongata
these fissures are well-pronounced
the infinity of convolutions betokens
considerable intelligence naturally
the intelligence isnt human or even
mundane yet the men in kresss
party unanimously recognized the mass
as being the living brain of what was
once a conscious organism

  despite my inexplicable fear i
stepped closer i was able to recognize
the truth of what hilton was telling
me yes it was a brain-not the small
grey sponge of a human but the black
alien giant brain of some unknown
monstrosity from another world

  fascinating isnt it hilton re-
marked

  i shook my head horrible i
said

  nevertheless its a prize a re-
markable specimen i will study it

  why dont you turn it over to the

authorities i asked

  hilton frowned his was the indig-
nation of a born collector

  its mine he insisted i intend
to keep it

j shrugged turned to go at the
  door i paused

  by the way i remarked you
said that arnold kress had some de-
lusions about the brain what exact-
ly do you mean

  hilton hesitated before he answered
oh nothing much he thought per-
haps the brain had been preserved as
a sort of god by the forgotten peoples
of the cave cities he thought that it
-well you know the fancies a sick
mind indulges in

   i let it go at that

  let me know if you find out any-
thing i told hilton as i left the
room

  going through the hall i encoun-
tered kiti crouching against the door-
way in the darkness there was a look
of abject fear on his livid little face

  i fancied that arnold kress wasnt
the only one who had strange fancies
about the black brain in the bowl kiti
had them too

  and that night when the memory
of that dark and living horror came
to slither through my dreams i won-
dered whether or not those fancies
might be true



izress has disappeared

        just three words three words
casually dropped by spencer at my
office

  yet for some reason the chills were
racing up my spine

  i tried to be casual as i pumped
spencer for information he didnt
know much got the news over the


fantastic adventures

telepapers this morning kress had
left his private sanitarium there was
a hint that he had not exactly left
in the ordinary sense of the word es-
caped was a better choice because
he had been under observation for an
acute mental disturbance

  in a flash i associated the story
with what hilton had told me kress
was more than a bit disturbed-he was
mad and he had escaped

  of course it wasnt my business
really or was it anyone who had
seen that black monstrosity in the bowl
would make it his business to find out
anythi connected with it and kress
had go  mad because hed found it

  thats why i could hardly wait un-
til evening to pay a call on dennis
hilton

  hilton answered the door himself
  wheres kiti i asked

hilton sighed the crazy fool
he said he left this morning couldnt
argue him out of it either wouldnt
stay in the same place with the thing
the brain

  yes

  i entered the hall but where
could he go hilton you certainly
werent fool enough to turn him loose
outside the authorities would nab
you for that soon enough illegal entry
of planetary visitors and all that

  i arranged to send him back to
venus on the afternoon flight hilton
told me but it leaves me short-
handed here and im worried
worried what about

  hilton answered me as he plodded
on ahead without my asking he was
leading me straight into the chamber
that housed the black brain

  this said hilton opening the
door and gesturing me in

  i stepped under the brilliant lights
stared around the white-tiled room
gaped at the glass bowl hanging from

the chains in the ceiling

jhe brain was there bubbling
blackly as it had in my midnight
dreams it contracted and expanded
rhythmically like some enormous black
heart-an evil heart nourished on un-
thinkable things i watched it pulsate
today the tendrils nerve-endings or
whatever they might be were not wav-
ing the entire mass seemed sluggish
and except for the ceaseless throbbing
it lay quiescent at the bottom of the
huge bowl

  hilton watched my eyes then he
coughed notice anything he asked
his voice was strangely husky

 why-no-that is- i stared
again i did notice something

  its bigger i said

  hiltons pallor was ghastly he
couldnt keep the forced smile on his
lips you see it too he whispered
much bigger i said why

  i dont know and it frightens me
you see kress said that too the
brain gets bigger look at it-nearly
six feet in bulk kress told me and
i laughed at him

  the words recalled my mission
  kress i said hes escaped
  whats that

  dont you know

  hilton shook his head

  i broke the story as id heard it i
thought hed come here to you i ad-
mitted thats why i stopped in
this is serious hilton murmured
he lit a sybarette with a nervous ges-
ture come on well go into my den
and see what must be done cant have
kress running around like this he
needs the proper attention

  we went out down the hall entered
the den i found a chair in the midst
of the museum display and sat down
as i did so my knee knocked against
a stick it fell to the floor with a clatter
the black brain



  i stooped picked it up the object
was a cane with a silver handle it
looked vaguely familiar

  kress arnold kress always carried
a silver-handled canel every telephoto
showed him with his stick my fingers
ran over the silver head encountered
grooves on the surface i looked down
my eyes read the initials a k

  my eyes rose to encounter the
shocked stare of dennis hilton

  all right he sighed ill admit it
kress was here

 when

  this afternoon he left about an
hour ago oh dont look at me like
that i did my best tried to persuade
him to return to the sanitarium but
hes mad i tell you utterly mad
hilton must have read my face
perfectly harmless though he
hastened on simply delusions of per-
secution thats all he wants to go
away to escape

  escape from what

  from the brain of course hilton
sat down heavily on a sofa he thinks
the brain is calling to him

  calling to him i echoed his words
in utter mystification

  yes thats what kiti believed
that the brain is not only alive but
powerful that it calls-telepathically
a sort of radioactive emanation that
results in a hypnotic pull

  thats why he gave the brain to
me kress admitted he thought he
could get away from it he doesnt
like me of course and he usually never
comes near my house so he thought
if i had the brain he might pull free of
it but he cant-he says the brain
called to him and he had to escape he
couldnt get away it called to him
you dont sound much better your-
self i said candidly im afraid
youre a candidate for a strait jacket
yourself

  dont say that hilton was on his
feet his face convulsed dont say
that to me i suppose you think im
crazy eh that i just imagine the
brain is growing that i just imagine
it whispers inside of my head and tells
me to-

e stopped

  go ahead hilton i mur-
mured what does the brain whisper
to you

  nothing he sat down again
hastily nothing i dont know what
im talking about i guess all this is
too much of a shock to me i wish you
could have seen the look on kresss face
when he came here i listened to what
he whispered about the brain he does
believe it was a god of some kind away
in that other world and he said it
must have called the guides to come
to it

  they were almost lost beyond the
great chasm he said though the
guides wouldnt admit it and then
they seemed to go forward all at once
as though they were being-directed
they came to the caves through an un-
believable maze and found the brain
right away because it called to them
kress told me it wanted to be found
it wanted to go out into the cosmos
again to a world where it could find
other minds to call to a world where
it could grow where it could grow
god 

  why does it grow when will it
stop growing how can i make it
stop

  i had the answer to that one

  destroy it i said

  no i couldnt do that hilton
was obviously sincere its too im-
portant a finding to destroy

  i twirled arnold kresss cane hil-
ton i said softly why do you think
the black brain grows


fantastic adventures

  do you want to know hilton
whispered do you really want to
know

  i nodded

  i think it feeds he murmured i
think it feeds on the minds of men
that it drains their thoughts their
urges their emotions that it grows
by drawing the power from other brains
like a black vampire yes a black
vampire thats what it is

  believing that i said-still softly
-do you think it is wise to keep it
here

  hilton gulped youre right his
voice was almost inaudible yes i
can see youre right it must be de-
stroyed will you come back again
tomorrow we shall do it together
you and i right now i dont think i
could stand seeing it again but to-
morrow evening at eight bring a
gun

  it was a pleasant invitation and
thinking of that growing monstrosity
-that black vampire as hilton called
it-it was an invitation i fully deter-
mined to keep

i knocked on hiltons door at
five minutes to eight at eight
oclock i put my shoulder to it and
battered it open in blind panic

  the feeling had been with me all
through the day something was
wrong something was utterly wrong

  now i knew it hilton didnt an-
swer the door

  the hallway was dark the entire
downstairs was dark no servants
human or otherwise greeted me

  and no voice answered my shouts as
i summoned dennis hilton

  i raced up the stairs through the
pitch-blackness of that empty house
switched on every light at the top of
the stairway hiltons room was
empty the house was deserted

 i made for the den the museum
trophy room nobody there i stood
in the doorway glancing around quick-
ly before i turned away

  then i saw the paper on the table

  the paper was crumpled the hand-
writing was so shaky it took me a full
minute to recognize it as dennis hil-
tons penmanship but the message
hit me at once just two words
scrawled in a sprawling hand

  get out

  never have i received more excel-
lent advice and it was advice i meant
to act on for some reason panic
gripped me i had no intention of
going down that hall and looking at
the brain in the bowl

  i would leave now and return with
the police that was the sensible way
-the only sane way somehow the
thought of facing that sinister entity
in the room beyond was terrifying in
a way i couldnt analyze but i
loathed the very thought of the black
brain the black brain pulsing there
throbbing endlessly through uncounted
eons of ghastly life growing and grow-
ing and preying on the minds of men
with a dark unhuman appetite

  i carried that thought with me as i
turned and left the doorway

  then i lost that thought

  i lost every thought

  now i could only feel

  for the house was throbbing about
me yes the house-the floors the
walls everything was pulsing puls-
ing in a weird rhythm a thumping
a contraction-expansion like the
brain

  the very air seemed to move in a
hideously alien tempo of its own it
blew back and forth it hummed with
a tension the tension of a purring
dynamo of a deathless machine a
a machine that pulsed and throbbed
like the brain
the black brain



  my own body seemed gripped by a
similar compulsion the blood sang
in my veins i was conscious of an
altered rhythm in my pulse my heart
pounded my breathing altered to
conform to the beats and my head
seemed squeezed and then released at
every pulsation every pulsation of
that ceaseless ebb and flow like the
brain

  now through the feeling came the
voice

  i thought it was a voice at first
then i realized that it was not a voice
i heard i heard nothing the voice
was felt i felt the voice inside me
whispering urging commanding

 come

  every expansion every contraction
each beat of the insistent rhythm
drove that command into my conscious-
ness

 come

german	
war secret
	discovered

as we all know much of germanys suc-
cess in the present war is due to the skill
of her scientists who have invented and
perfected many implements of war without which
mr schicklegruber would never have had the
audacity to even attempt to conquer the world
movies and stories all tell of germanys mighty
planes and tank corps but one weapon that is
seldom mentioned but was feared by the allies
was the highly efficient anti-tank gun that played
havoc within the british tank corps during the
african campaign

  but this secret weapon is now an open book
to the allies for many of the guns were captured
in perfect condition together with their special
type ammunition in libya

  according to reports that have been issued since
the guns were captured the germans had simply
used the commonly known fact that velocity aids
the penetrating force of a moving body they
have adapted this principle to produce several
different guns that had shells with sufficient
velocity to bore right through tank armor their
most dangerous gun is the  millimeter piece
that can be used either to fight tanks or aircraft
in all appearances it closely resembles a huge naval
gun and it can put a hole in three inches of armor
with the ease of a hot knife going through butter
however it has one defect of being very big
and heavy which affects it maneuverability and
thus it is easier for the enemy to knock it out
to compromise on a gun that would be effective
yet easy to handle the german war scientists de-
veloped the so millimeter gun the whole power
of the gun does not lie in the high velocity it
gives its shells but much of its effectiveness is due

to the type of shells it uses according to one of
the officers who examined the gun and its shells
the shells can be best described as using the trick
of driving a needle through a penny by first push-
ing the needle through a cork so that it cant
bend or break thus the entire shell weighs al-
most four and a half pounds while the part that
does all the boring into the armor is about the
size of a mans thumb in place of the long steel
projectile found on regular shells these anti-
tank shells have only a long thin sharp point
jutting out from the center of the casing with a
square shoulder around the base to give it neces-
sary balance

  the shell does its dirty work in three steps
first of all the needle point comes into contact
with the surface of the tanks armor and thus all
the force of the impact is centered on one spot
with the result that the surface is cracked next
the cylinder of soft metal that surrounds the
bullet compresses all about the point and this
prevents the shot from slithering off the tank
lastly the shot that does the boring rushes
through the soft metal and hits the armor plate
at the instant that the needle point is placing the
greatest possible strain on the plate once the
shot gets inside the tank it moves about like a
drunken driver ricocheting from one surface to
another and leaving death and destruction in its
wake

  many observers of this gun in action regard
this piece of booty to be as important as any yet
captured by the allies and soon this gun or at
least its principles will be fighting on the side of
the allies to bring victory more quickly for our
side	- t bott

 wants more of frank patton

sirs

  i certainly hope that the january fa is an in-
dication of things to come during  cause it
was a darned good issue

  jones front cover was the kind of painting that
sort of grows on one the more you look at it the
better you like it jones seems to be an excellent
fantasy artist-lets see more of his work

  the back cover was fair it presented mercury
in an interesting way but paul fell down a bit on
his portrayal of the god himself

  the stories rank thusly 

  	the man with five lives by clyde
woodruff an unusual yam to say the least
woodruff has a completely original style and i
would like to see more of his work in fa i of
course cannot be sure of what newcomers fantasy
will see in  but just on the basis of his per-
formance in this issue i hereby nominate him as
the find of the year

  	the ice queen by don wilcox the plot
was old incredibly old but wilcox has a knack
of taking old plots inserting new twists and
blending it all with his pleasing style of writing
result another wilcox hit

  	sammy calls a noobus by henry norton
reminded me of something booth tarkington
might have done

  	lefty feep catches hell by robert bloch

  	saunders strange second sight by clee
garson presents an interesting idea not out-
standing though

  	freddie funks madcap mermaid by
leroy yerxa mediocre

  	mr trouble by david wright obrien

  	the perfect husband by dwight v
swain hmmmm

  was very glad to see rod ruth back with so
many fine illustrations jones cannot do decent
interiors-keep him on covers jackson was okay
bilder rather poor

  any chance of frank patton coming back this
year

                         chad oliver

                         s ledgewood
                         cincinnati ohio

  the chances of frank patton coming back this
year are very good chad weve been pursuadmg
mr patton to do another like his doorway to
hell story and we think hes finally kinda sold
on the idea himself-ed

january issue great

sirs

  i dont usually write fan letters but i just had
to after reading the man with five lives it
was great the entire january issue was great
lefty feep was very amusing as usual fan-
tastic magazine heads my list of favorites
everything about the magazine is super

                       janet jones

                         brown street
                        chester penna

  it certainly pleases us to get letters like this
and naturally we agree that the man with
five lives was great it isnt often that your
editor gets a chance to appear in a story-ed

not that he doesnt like wilcox

sirs

  this is the first time that i have written to you
concerning your publication as a rule i read
your magazine without a murmur but i was so
astounded by a series of chronological errors that
i found in don wilcoxs the ice queen which
appeared in your january issue that i simply
could not stay quiet

  the story appears to take place somewhere in
the middle eighteen-hundreds the author takes
pains early in the plot to place its time by describ-
ing the attitude of one steve pound towards the
new-fangled steamship and by pointing out his
disbelief in the possibility of ships ever traveling
in the air the vessel in which the party makes
its way to the north is a sailing ship without aux-
iliary power these statements occur at the bot-
tom of page twelve however after having so
carefully shown the reader when his story is tak-
ing place the author proceeds to completely ignore
his self imposed limits and commit a series of
anachronisms which are really astounding

  the hero of the tale a very adventurous young
painter at several points in his heroic progress
pauses to muse upon what a stir it would cause if
he should be able to bring the ice queen back to
the world of tall buildings and rushing traffic and
bright lights he mentions skyscrapers and such
paraphernalia of our modern civilization follow-
ing any known rule of writing such a young man
living around  could not very well be ac-
quainted so intimately with the world of 
then at the end we find the villain of the drama

lady lorruth shooting down six people before
they realize what she is up to am i correct in
my assumption that at the period the story is
supposed to be unfolding the modem repeating
rifle was not lying around ready to be used by
anyone who so desired also we find the learned
professor of the party talking glibly of the cro-
magnon men and what their implements and
culture had been like it is interesting to note
that the term cro-magnon and knowledge of that
race did not exist until after  the professor
on this jaunt could scarcely be expected to be
acquainted with what their tools were like before
evidences of them had been discovered

  all this goes to show that the story was hastily
thrown together and that little thought went into
is makeup i am not criticising don wilcox as a
writer for he is excellent however i do wish
that he would be a little more careful in his selec-
tion of details such sloppiness is not worthy of
fantastic adventures i hope that this letter
will be received in the spirit in which it is sent

                       william a kaynor
                        yale station

                      new haven conn

  your criticism is absolutely true and i guess we
all slipped up a little on the story what do you
have to say for yourself mr wilcox shame
shamel-ed

story identified

sirs

  i have just read your letters from readers in the
january issue and recognized the description of the
story given by mr cunningham as being chil-
dren of the morning by w l george it was
copyrighted in  by american weekly inc
and in  by g p putnams sons i have it
in book form

  i have been reading fantastic adventures and
amazing stories for the past three years or so and
i enjoy them very much i think they are really
fine but somehow i cant see children of the
morning in your magazine at all it is different
but not really so fantastic and not scientific it is
something that really could happen

  however i wouldnt presume to tell you not to
print it you have done a grand job in suiting
most of us so far and thats good enough for me
i guess other folks have written that they knew
the story too so ill stop

  if no one else did write in then maybe i was
of some help in clearing up the name and author
of the story i hope so

                        mrs c r hayes

                         yi catalpa ave
                         hayden park del

  we have received numerous letters in answer to
mr cunninghams description of a story which
left a deep impression on him but whose title he
had forgotten it seems they all agree as to the
title children of the morning arid most of them
consider it a classic-ed
a miracle issue

sin

  it is against my principles to rave about any
mag a sf magazine cannot expect to glide
through a year on the crest of one good issue
however in some instances these principles do
not hold good this is one of those times most
of the time your magazine is slightly above aver-
age the rest of the time it is below average it
is very seldom that an issue appears on the stands
to really cheer about but once in a while a
miracle does happen and you turn out an issue
with some kick to it first off comes the praise
then comes a couple brickbats what a mess
this letter is

  the dec  issue was one of those miracle
issues the stories were i mean nearly all of
them crammed full of laughs incidentally you
havent put out an issue this good in quite some
time to use a rather childish expression the
stories were super colossal

  mcgivem certainly turned out a fine yarn the
sustained interest and fast moving action made this
story a smash hit i enjoy stories dealing with the
present day situation although the yarn held my
attention from beginning to end it was still a
dressed up adventure yarn the plot was too
plausible it belonged in g-man detective
i hope im not contradicting myself hamilton
was quite a disappointment whats the matter
with him he should subscribe to writers di-
gest long remember was a nice compact
little yam obrien certainly recovered nicely
from his recent fumbles nice comeback the
incredible antique was fair it would have been
much better if the ending had been lengthened
lefty feep or i should say robert bloch is
always good for a laugh and this time was no
exception south did a nice job on his echo
yarn how about a series featuring benny im
sure they would be well received garsons yarn
was right on the beam where did lawlor come
from judging from his story he seems quite an
addition to your tas of authors i see cabot
is still batting em out good for him that boy
sure can turn out the stories yerxa is fast be-
coming my favorite shorts author and now on
to the features

  to me gades articles are fascinating mainly
because they deal with myths and legends the
editors notebook comes through with an assort-
ment of news facts etc my favorite feature is
obviously the readers page that covers the
features so ill rocket on to the illustrations

  mccauley did an extra fine job on the front
cover let fuqua do a cover once in a while
paul was fine on the back cover except for his
usual mistake i believe apollo was a man am
i not right  his face was too effeminate in
plain one syllable words apollo had the face of
a young girl the best illustration in the book was
drawn by virgil finlay mccauley and fuqua
tied for second place milburn easily took third
place he has made quite an improvement

  how come a short story gets two illustrations
while the novels get but one get rid of the
following artists l raymond jones rod ruth

a country school teacher

sirs

  i do enjoy your magazine living in the
country as i do life would be pretty dull if it
wasnt for fantastic and amazing i havent
finished the current issue but so far it is tops
particularly sammy calls a noobus please
continue to use magarian whenever you can get
her there is a wealth of detail about her work
that is refreshing after the blurs some so-called
artists turn out i must say that fantastic and
amazing are less guilty of blurry art work than
some others in the field of science-fiction

  is there any chance of getting bond to continue
his stories of the future like jay chidsey i am
all in favor of more bond  would also like to
hear more about eagle boy and his people

  now leaving fantastic for a moment is how-
ard browne warrior of the dawn just another
name for e r burroughs or is he just a particu-
larly careful imitator of burroughs style and plot
i dont really care either way warrior of the
dawn was one of the best stories i have read in
years but it did remind me very much of bur-
roughs even to the ending which so plainly called
for a sequel where the hero would finally get the
girl of course st j ohn pictures helped the
resemblance a great deal

  now for my own question to the readers can
some one tell me which magazine printed a story
some time in the early s called the prince
of space also who wrote it it was my first
science fiction story and i would like to know who
wrote it

a country school teacher

  no howard browne is not another name for
burroughs mr browne being an enthusiastic
admirer of burroughs may have followed a sim-
ilar style but it certainly wasnt an imitation
the consensus of opinion is warrior of the
dawn is one swell story-ed

s best

sirs

  at last the time has come to recount and nom-
inate the best stories of  it has been a good
year all in all despite some miserable flops-i
wont name them-and well worth remembering
so without further ado the ten best stories of
 in fantastic adventures
fantastic adyentures



   	mademoiselle butterfly by don wilcox
 the kind of story you utter in the same breath
 with austin hall a merritt george allan
 england-in other words a reed classic won-
 derful 

   	rainbow of death by don wilcox when
 this first appeared it scarcely made a splash-
 ca i understand why unless the fans are a bunch
 of saps wilcox definitely justifies the existence
 of fantastic adventures all by himself-not
 that there are no other good authors of course

   	the leopard girl by don wilcox don
 is monopolizing this list twould seem but he
 deserves it

   	the eagle man by don wilcox-well i
 that i believe is some sort of a record dont
 think a sequel would rate this way and advise
 you to ignore the squawks of those who want
 fire jump to return otherwise we might have
 soi ething like what happened to oscar of mars
 the first story of that series was swell but look
 at the junk the latest tale is oscarette is the
 depth of something or other and fire jump is
 a much better character than oscar-altogether
 too good to be worked to death

   	the empress of mars by ross rocklynne
 this reprint would have taken first place easily
 if wilcox hadnt been in the way but definitely
 good-not rocklynnes best but excellent in itself

   	when freemen shall stand by nelson s
 bond it was better than after an age which
 appeared the same month in amazing stories
 binders tale while good was not another dark-
 ness and dawn as you claimed but bonds story
 was better than we had any right to expect on
 this theme and by this author i refuse to ask
 for a sequel

  	fate and the fly by robert moore
 williams a short story appears at last-and a
 good one your shorts this year have been much
 better than those of previous years tales such
 as the scarlet rollers are average yarns now
 but would have been leading the short stories of
  fate and the fly however is no aver-
 age story by anybodys count it is itp there
 with the best

   	house of fire by robert moore williams
 though similar to fifth column of mars in
 plot it was a much better story williams can
 do a neat bit of characterization when he wants
 to

   	the quest in time by edmond hamilton
 heres a story that rolls along with every bit of
 the good old hamilton excitement and plot
 furthermore he must have done a lot of re-
 search for this yarn-the various aztec refer-
 ences have the ring of reality about them in
 sharp contrast to many of your lost-race
 novels encore encore not a sequel to this
 yarn but one on similar theme-in ancient gaul
 with caesar for example is that a good idea
 ed or isnt it

   	doorway to hell by frank patton its
 too bad this author doesnt have more time to
 write as he is your most promising new author

  conclusion don wilcox is your best author
bar none he is surpassed in amazing stories
however by anthony gilmore and one or two
others

  the current issue december shows promise
for   didnt know mcgivern had it in him
to do anything like the ghost that haunted
hitler- he has done fair-to-excellent humor
yarns and some middlin-to-awful adventure
stories but this-theres hope for mr mcgivern
yet was it the theme that elevated him or
what and your short stories pack a terrific
wallop

  oh by the way a correction there is one
of your authors who could outdo wilcox if he
tried hard although the three stories of his which
you printed just barely fall short that author is
nat schachner where has he been this last
year

  p s robert bloch deserves some kind of a
special medal for the lefty feep stories only
two fell from the uniformly high and hilarious
standard and only one of these actually
flopped turning out really funny copy at that
rate is going some

  what we can add to this letter we dont know i
so we wont-ed

here it is in print

sirs

  another month rolls by and another issue of
fantastic adventures comes to my attention was
it an outstanding issue to be frank-it wasnt
was it an average issue no i wont even con-
cede that point it was a below average issue
although it was headed by two novels and they
werent anything to tear ones hair out about
do i make myself clear i think i do

  some people have a tendency to ask the ques-
tion  quote if they dont this and that about
your mag why do they buy it unquote all
ive got to say about this ed is that if all of
the fans or i should say fellow readers gushed
over with praise and honey-dew like some of the
readers this magazine would soon become nothing
but a memory praise is alright in its place but
it can be overdone when an issue arrives thats
worth gushing over ill gush for that matter
i had quite a bit of praise stacked up in my letter
to the dec issue in my rating of sci-fic mags
fa ties for second place with as ffm being
tops on the list

  robert gibson jones did a nice job on the
front cover give him more cover work but
keep him strictly away from inside work that
is if he did the pics for the ice queen his
work for this story was a mere mass of scribbles
and contours it looked like the work of a three-
year-old left alone with a box of pencils harsh
arent i as an artist of humans paul makes a
fine spot-welder i sincerely wish he would stick
to machines and if he must draw humans have
them at a distance

  rod ruths illustrations for the feep yarn
was his best of the four stories he illustrated his
others would pass in a dim-out a k bilder
fantastic adventures



was the ultimate in sci-fic com oh brother
mccauley is alright the odds are always even
if not better when he draws whether he  on
the cover or in the interior jay jackson showed
much improvement in this issue i hope he keeps
it up

  the best story in this issue i cannot even at-
tempt to name the ice queen was quite a
letdown wilcox has done better than that wood-
ruffs yarn wasnt any better it had me skipping
paragraphs and that isnt intended as a com-
pliment what was really a surprise was blochs
tale lefty catches hell after reading the
two novels i naturally expected to relax and en-
joy the feep pick-me-up i was wrong how-
ever this is the first of the feep stories that
has been a disappointment obriens story didnt
ring the bell but it certainly wasnt too bad i am
changing my opinion about yerxa you can do
without him

  i dont like to disappoint the editor but i am
not going to say quote i doubt if this letter
will be printed because of the opinion contained
therein or i dare you to print this letter
nnnyyyyaaaaa unquote i am also not going to
say it doesnt matter whether this letter is pub-
lished or not to tell the truth i would like to
see it in print but there i go using a line like
the other vacuum-minded children who use these
trick phrases to catch the editors eye

  here it is in print richard just as you wrote
it sincere opinions regarding our magazine
whether favorable or unfavorable are always
worthy of publication-ed

one of the best issues

sirs

  the january issue of fantastic adventures was
one of the best that i have ever read even con-
sidering the wilcox novel yes ed thats what
i said even considering the wilcox novel not
that wilcox isnt a good writer but if you would
cut his stuff down to about so pages it would be
about twice as interesting and get him to put
more fantasy in his stories in the ice queen
he used that old plot of the lost race that the
hero accidentally stumbles upon falls in love with
some female or another then finally delivers to
the outside world wilcox has used that plot
twice that i know of jarvis used it once and
hamilton twice on lost city of burma and
daughter of thor please this plot is so hack-
neyed that it can hardly be called fantasy or sci-
ence-fiction any more even leroy yerxa used
it in his queen of the flaming diamond to
go even farther burroughs used it in his series
on pellucedar

  and now to list the stories  the man
with five lives-clyde woodruff ah thats
my dish a new plot can you imagine that
part about the story being written by the liar was
really ingenious how about more by this au-

the black brain

continued from page 

   it was the brain the brain that
 had called to arnold kress the brain
 that had called to kiti the brain
 that might have called to dennis hil-
 ton and now it was calling to me

   come

t walked down the hall the gun
in my pocket was forgotten my
original intention was forgotten my
very name my being was lost to me in
the strength of that hypnotic command

   i passed the outer tiled chamber
 where the light blazed like a man
 in a trance i walked through the open
 doorway and stood before the brain

   the brain had grown its black bulk
 loomed ten feet and towered along the
 glass sides of the huge bowl i stood
 and stared mutely

   it was sucking my own brain eating
 away my sanity this i realized i
 wondered how this would help it grow
fantastic adventures



i wondered what would become of me
-would i be left with a vacant mind
an empty shell i wondered why i
must stand before it so it could nourish
itself

  all this i pondered but i could not
move i could not resist or run away
even as i saw the brain swell and
thicken i couldnt run i was trapped
and the black brain billowed up-

  i heard my name then felt my
name then a voice that was not a
voice-a voice that was only a thought
within me-screamed kill it for
gods sake kill it before it gets you

  i recognized hiltons thought the
spell snapped my hand went for the
gun

  even as i whipped it out i saw
things happen

  i saw the horrid suggestion of a
face forming within those black and
boiling depths i saw the rudimentary
nerve endings resolve into limbs and
feelers that reached out to claw i
saw the utterly hellish suggestion of a
great mouth  a grinning black
maw gaping in the depths of the throb-
bing mass

  i shot i fired again and again the
bowl shattered into a million fragments
but i kept pumping-pumping into the
writhing blackness of the huge mon-
strosity that slithered towards me even
as i ripped it to dirty black ribbons

  in a moment it was over i stared
down at the bubbling coagulated mass
that was all that remained of the black
brain for a moment i fancied i saw
something-but it must have been my
own imagination

  because i knew suddenly what had
happened to the men lost on kresss
expedition i knew what had happened
to kiti-who did not go back on the
afternoon flight to venus i knew what
had happened to kress-who did not
leave the house again after his escape
and staring at the mass on the floor i
concluded on page

fantastic adventures

phaeton

son of apollo
by morris j steele

pictured on this months bock cover is the legendary
young god whose wild ride almost destroyed the earth

in all mythology there is no more action-
packed pathos-filled and significant legend
than that of phaeton son of helios or
apollo the sun god and clymene the nymph

  this young god like all youngsters developed
a yen to drive the old mans car and kept
pestering him to do it he pleaded for many
years until one day the sun god greed- he
hitched up the horses to the sun chariot one
morning gave the reins to phaeton and cau-
tioned him not to dent any fenders nor under
any conditions get off the road

  the young god filled with enthusiasm set on
up the sky and looked down with glee as the
flaming chariot in which he rode became the
sun which earth people worshipped as the
very giver of life of their existence

  as he drove along he became vastly interested
in the zodiacal scenery and unconsciously began
veering off the road at times ominous rum-
blings scared him back onto his course but when
he noted the ease with which he could guide
the horses with the reins he began to get reck-
less he skirted the edge of the sun path dashed
off it and then on again the horses rushed
ahead as he applied the whip their manes
tossed and roaring flames shot out from the
flashing wheels

  phaeton laughed in glee and drove the chariot
at still greater speed he would show the peo-
ple on earth how a real god could drive the
sun chariot he looked down as he saw them
staring up in amazement and fear he drove
lower still

  lightning flashed thunder rumbled and the
earth shook fleeing humans scurried to shelter
from the heat in caves

  the horses frightened by the noise the near-
ness of earth and smarting beneath the whip
of the arrogant young god bolted they tore
the reins from phaetons hands and became run-
aways

  down the zenith flashed the hurtling sun
chariot and now the young god became fright-
ened he screamed at the horses to stop he
belabored them with the whip but to no avail
he was helpless and disaster stared him in the
face

 below earth trembled as the sun drew
nearer gravity forces clashed and continents
stirred in their beds storms swept the air
battered the seas against the shores and blister-

ing heat sent whole forests into flaming inferno

  apollo reached for his checkbook to pay his
delinquent insurance but it was too late the
policy had lapsed-with his good judgment when
he had allowed the youngster to drive the char-
iot now instead he went to zeus father of
gods and gave him the disturbing news

  my wild son is destroying the earth he
cried in terror

  zeus gathered up his thunderbolts and strode
down the sky in pursuit of the runaway sun
chariot already he could see much damage
had been done on earth he ran faster shov-
ing his way past many frightened legendary sky-
fieures and lesser gods who were flocking to
the scene of the impending disaster

  when he came within range zeus loosed his
first thunderbolt it went wide and landed in
the arizona desert with a terrific concussion
the crater and fragments of the holt can be
seen to this day but his second bolt went
true and it struck phaeton in the forehead send-
ing him plunging from the sky like a meteor

  the sun chariot raced on but the horses free
now of their mad master slowed down and
apollo caught them brought them to a halt
and drove back up the appointed highway

  phaetons body landed on earth at the mouth
of the river eridanus a river now identified as
the po in italy here he lay until found by
his sisters the heliades who were grief-stricken
they had loved the handsome youth and they
were so grieved that they changed into poplars
which grow to this day at the mouth of the po

  their tears which were copious were changed
into amber which is also a famed product of
italy in modern times as well as ancient the
tears of the heliades have been cherished as
amulets and trinkets and for jewelry by many
humans through the centuries

  just how much of the legend of phaeton and
his reckless and fatal ride is based on truth is
problematical but scientifically it seems the
one that most lends itself to fact the huge
meteor of arizona and the wide mouth of the
po may have been the result of a flaming visi-
tor from space which is still remembered by
man as the first and last ride of a headstrong
young god named phaeton we will never
know for sure but it is fairly safe to assume
that such a phenomenon is behind this myth
