solitude

sheldon had plunged on into this
new cotintry rather recklessly being
in reckless mood now five days
northward of belle fortune he knew that
he had somewhere taken the wrong trail

  the knowledge came upon him grad-
ually there was the suspicion before
ten oclock that morning when the stream
he followed seemed to him to be running
a little too much to the northwest but
he had pushed on watchful of every step
seeking a blazed tree or the monument of
a stone set upon a rock

     x a-s

    when he made camp at noon he was
  still undecided inclined to believe that
  the wise thing would be to turn back
  but he did not turn back he was his
  own man now all time was before him
  the gigantic wilderness about him was
  grateful  at night when he had yanked
  his small pack down from his horses
  saddle suspicion had grown into certain-
  ty he smoked his good-night pipe in
  deep content

    if you could run a line straight from
  belle fortune to ruminoff shanty-and
  youd want both tunnel and aeroplane to
  do the job nicely-your line would
  measure exactly two hundred and forty

miles it would cut almost in halves the
sasnokee-keewan the country into which
few men come let entirely alone by the
indians who with simple emphasis term
it  bad country

  men have found gold on gold river
where the russian camp of ruminoff
shanty made history half a century ago
they have taken out the pay-dirt at belle
fortune between the two points they
have made many trails during fifty years
trails which invariably turn to east or
west of the sasnokee-keewan for here
is a land of fierce iron-boweled moun-
tains of tangled brush which grows thick
and defies the traveler of long reaches of
lava-rock and granite of mad white
raging winters

   leave it alone men say down in
belle fortune and up in ruminoff  its
no-luck land many a poor devils
gone in that never came out and never
a man brought a show of color out of it

  since belle fortune had dropped one
day behind him it had all been new coun-
try to sheldon although summer was on
its way there had been few men before
him since the winter had tom out the
trails here and there upon the north
slopes and in the shaded canons patches
and mounds of snow were thawing slowly

  more than once had he come to a fork-
ing of the ways but he had pushed on
without hesitating content to be driving
ever deeper into the wilderness he
planned vaguely on reaching french
meadows by way of the upper waters of
the little smoky climbing the ridge
whence rumor had it you could see fifteen
small lakes at once but what mattered
it french meadows or the very heart of
the sasnokee-keewan

  a man who took life as it came was
john sheldon who lived joyously heed-
lessly often enough recklessly when
other men grumbled he had been known
to laugh while these last lean hard
years had toughened both physical and
mental fiber they had not hardened his
heart and yet a short five days ago he
had had murder in his heart

  he had just made his  pile  he with
charlie ward who sheldon had thought
was straight and straight the poor devil
would have been had it not been that he
was weak and there was a woman he
wanted her she wanted his money its
an old story

  sheldon for once was roused from his
careless good-natured acceptance of what
the day might bring he had befriended
ward and ward had robbed him - in
the first flare of wrath he took up the
man trail he followed the two for ten
days coming up with them then at belle
fortune

  there had been ten days of riot wine
and cards and roulette-wheel for charlie
ward and the woman sheldon getting
word here and there had had little hope
of recovering his money but he did not
expect what he did find charlie was
dying-had shot himself in a fit of re-
morseful despondency the woman was
staring at him grief-stricken stunned
utterly human after all

  she had loved him it seemed that was
the strange part of it the few gold
pieces which were left she hurled at shel-
don as he stood in the door cursing him
he turned heard charlies gasps through
the chink of the coins went out tossed
his revolver into the road bought a pack
outfit shouldered a rifle and left belle
fortune  for a hunting trip as he ex-
plained it to himself he had never got
a bear in his life and-

  and there is nothing in all the world
like the deepest solitude of the woods to
take out of a mans heart the bitterness
of revenge sheldon was a little ashamed
of himself he wanted to forget gold and
the seeking thereof and therefore per-
haps his fate took it upon herself to hide
a certain forking of the trails under a
patch of snow so that he turned away
from french meadows and into the sas-
nokee-keewan

  now he was lost lost merely in so
far as he did not know where he was not
that he need worry about being able to
retrace his steps he had provisions am-
the fire flower



munition fishing tackle bedding was in
a corner of the world where men did not
frequently come and could stay here the
whole summer if he saw fit he had been
hunting gold all the years of his life it
seemed to him what had it brought
him what good had it done him
never was man in better mood to be lost
than was john sheldon as he knocked out
his pipe rolled into his blankets and
went to sleep

   now the sixth day out he watched his
 way warily if he were not already in
 the sasnokee-keewan he should to-day
 or by to-morrow noon at the latest come
 to the first of the nine lakes he had
 studied the stars last night he had
 watched the sun to-day it was guess-
 work at best since he had had no tnought
 to prick his way by map

   night came again and he looked from
 a ridge down upon other ridges some bare
 and granite-topped some timbered with
 here and there a tall peak looking out
 across the broken miles with no hint of
 lake nopong he made his way down a
 long slope in the thickening dusk seeking
 a grassy spot to tether his packhorse
 that night the animal crunched sun-
 flower leaves and the tenderer hoots of
 the mountain bushes with the dawn
 sheldon again pushed on seeking better
 pasture

   late that afternoon he came into a de-
 lightfully green meadow where a raging
 creek grew suddenly gentle and wan-
 dered through crisp herbage and little
 white flowers there was a confusion of
 deer-tracks where a narrow trail slipped
 through the alders of the creek banks
 upon the rim of the meadow was a great
 log freshly torn into bits as though by
 the great paws of a bear

   under a tall isolated cedar about
whose base there was dry ground shel-
don removed the canvas-rolled pack and
the pack-saddle turning his horse into an
alder-surrounded arm of the meadow
where the grass was thickest and tallest
while the sun was still high he cut the
branches which he would throw his blan-

 kets upon fried his bacon and potatoes
 boiled his coffee and ate heartily

  then he sat upon the log at which the
bear had torn saw the tracks and nodded
over them noting that they were only a
few days old-smoked his pipe and out
of the fulness of content watched his hun-
gry horse ripping away at the lush grass

   take your time buck old boy he
said gently  well stay right here until
you get a bellyful we dont have to
move on until snow flies if we dont want
to i think that this is one of the spots
of the world weve been looking for a
long time id lay a man a bet two to
one and he names the stakes that theres
not another human being in three days
walk

   and a very little after sunset with the
same thought soothing him he went to
sleep

chapter ii

bones

the seventh day out sheldon began
in practical manner by shaving
his beard was beginning to turn in
and itch and even upon trips like this
he had yet to understand why a fellow
shouldnt include in his pack the razor
brush and soap which altogether occu-
pied no more space than a pocket tin of
tobacco

  he was up and about in the full glory
of the morning before the last star had
gone a grub from a fallen log went onto
a hook into the creek and down a trouts
eager throat and the trout itself was
brown in the pan almost as the coffee be-
gan to bubble over thirty minutes after
he had waked he was leading the fuli-
stomached buck northward along the
streams grassy banks

  the world seemed a good place to live
in this morning clean and sweet blown
through with the scents of green growing
things the ravine widened before him
the timber was big boled with grassy
open spaces though there was no sign of

a trail other than the tracks left by wild
things coming to feed and water he
swung on briskly

   if i really am in the sasnokee-
 keewan he told himself early in the day
  then men have maligned it or else i
 have stumbled into a corner of it they
 have missed somehow it strikes me as
 the nearest thing imaginable to the
 earthly paradise

   he had turned out to the right fol-
 lowing the open coming close under a
 line of cliffs which stood up sheer and
 formidable along the edge of the meadow
 and then suddenly unexpectedly he
 came upon the first sign he had had for
 three days that a man had ever been be-
 fore him in these endless woods upon
 the rocky ground at the foot of the cliffs
 was a mans skeleton

   sheldon stopped and stared the
 thing shocked him it seemed incon-
 ceivable that a man could have died here
 miserably as this poor fellow had done
 alone crying out aloud to the solitudes
 which answered him softly with gently
 stirring branches and murmuring water
 sheldons mood one of serene ineffable
 peace had had so strong a grasp upon
 him that this sign of tragedy and death
 was hard to grasp

   he stood long staring down at the
 heap of bones they were tumbled this
 way and that he shuddered and yet
 he stood there fascinated wondering let-
 ting his suddenly awakened overstimu-
 lated imagination have its way

   there came the query  what killed
 him

   sheldon looked up at the cliffs the
 man might have fallen but the skull
 was intact there had been no fracture
 there nor-sheldon forgot his previous
 revulsion of feeling in his strong curiosity
 -nor was there a broken bone of arm
 or leg to indicate a fall the bones were
 large it had been a big man six feet or

 -	over and heavy no in spite of the
 position of the disordered skeleton death
 had not come that way

   for half an hour sheldon lingered here

restrained a little by the thoughts rising
naturally to the occasion seeking to read
the riddle set before him there were no
rattlesnakes here no poisonous insects at
these altitudes the man had not fallen
to come here at all he must have been
one who knew the mountains then he
had not starved for the streams were
filled with trout and he would know the
way to trap small game enough to keep
life in him and what man ever came so
deep into the wild without a rifle

  it seemed to sheldon that there was
only one answer the man must have
got caught here in an early snow-
storm he must have lost his head in-
stead of going calmly about preparing
shelter and laying up provisions for the
winter he must have raced on madly
getting more hopelessly lost at every be-
wildered step-and then the end had
come hideously

  at last sheldon moved on pondering
the thoughts which centered about the
white pile of bones which once perhaps
four or five or six years ago had been a
man how the poor devil must have
cursed the nights that blotted the world
out the winds which shrieked of snow
the mountains which rose like walls about
a convict

   what became of his gun cried shel-
don suddenly speaking aloud  the
buckle from his belt the metal things in
his pockets knife coins cartridges the
things which prowling animals cant eat
they dont carry such things off

  he came back walking swiftly there
was little grass so close to the cliffs
nothing but bare rocky ground and a
few bits of dry wood two or three old
cones dropped from a pine nothing to
hide the articles which sheldon sought
but although he made assurance doubly
sure by searching carefully for more than
an hour back and forth along the cliffs
out among the trees he found nothing
not so much as the sole of a boot

   and that muttered sheldon taking
up bucks lead rope  if a man asked me
is infernally strange
the fire flower



  as he went on he strove frowningly for
an explanation and found none the
man had not been alone he had had a
companion this companion had taken
bis rifle his knife and watch or what-
ever might have been in his pockets and
had gone on possibly but then why
had he not taken the time to bury the
body and how was it that there was
not a single shred of clothing

   coyotes may be so everlastingly hun-
gry up here that they eat a mans boots
soles nails and all grunted sheldon
 only-i am not the kind of a tender-
foot to believe that particular brand of
fairy tale theres not even a button

  it is the way of the human intellect to
contend with locks upon doors which shut
on secrets the mind given half of the
story demands the remainder john
sheldon as he trudged on grew half
angry with himself because he could not
answer the questions which insisted upon
having answers but before noon he had
almost forgotten the scattered bones un-
der the cliffs the matter thrust to one
rim of his thoughts which must now be
given over almost entirely to finding trail

  for no longer was there meadow-land
under foot the strip of fairly level
grassy land was gone abruptly beyond
lay boulder-strewn slopes fringed with
dense brush all but impassable to the
packhorse

  often the man must leave the animal
while he went ahead seeking a way often
must the two of them turn back for some
unexpected fall of cliff all unseen until
they were close to the edge compelling
them to retrace their steps perhaps a hun-
dred yards or five hundred and many a
time did sheldon begin to think that the
way was shut to the plucky brute that
labored on under his pack

  but always he found a way on a way
down and always being a man used to
the woods did he keep in mind that the
time might come when hed have to turn
back for good if he could in time win
on through come out at the north end
of the sasnokee-keewan then he would

have had a trip which left nothing to be
desired

  if on the other hand there came cliffs
across the trail which buck could not
make his way down around which they
could not go-why then it was as well
to have the way open this way for
sheldon had no thought to desert the
horse without which just now hed make
far better time

  it was the hardest day he had had
that means that half a dozen times be-
tween dawn and dark the man hesitated
on the verge of turning back alone he
could have gone on and with twice the
speed leading buck he wondered many
a time if he could push on another mile
without rewarding his horse with a bro-
ken leg and yet being a man who dis-
liked turning back and having to do with
a horse that put all of his faith in his
master unquestioningly he put another
ten miles between him and belle fortune
that long hard day

  in the afternoon he was forced to leave
the creek which was rapidly growing into
a river which shot shouting down
through a rocky gorge narrow and steep-
sided as the stream began turniftg off
to the west sheldon climbed out of its
canon made a wide detour to avoid a
string of bare peaks lifting against the
northern sky-line and made a slow and
difficult way over the ridge in a sort of
saddle he left his panting horse while he
clambered to a spire of rock lifted a score
of feet above the pass

  he could look back from here and see
the stream he had left here and there
he caught a glimpse of the water slip-
ping away between the trees or flashing
over a boulder as it sped down toward
the gorge he was glad that he had
turned aside as soon as he had done
there would have been no getting out of
that chasm unless a man came back here
and he had lost enough time as it was

  he turned his eyes toward the north
a trlie wilderness if god ever made one
to defy the taming hand of man-a wil-
derness of mountains an endless stretch


all-story weekly

of bare ridges and snow-capped peaks a
maze of steep-sided gorges like the one
he had just quitted a stern all but track-
less labyrinth in which a man if he were
not a fool must keep his wits about him

   gods knows meditated sheldon his
spirit touched with that awe which comes
to a man who stands alone as he stood
looking down upon the world where the
deity has builded in fierce untrammeled
majesty  a man is a little thing in a
place like this i suppose if i were vise
i would turn tail and get out while i
can

  and again he pushed on northward
there was little feed here for buck both
horse and man wanted water though
they had left the creek but two hours ago
the dry air and summer sun had stirred
in them the thirst which sleeps so little
out on the trail

  sheldon knew that they had but to
make their way down into another ravine
to find water in these mountains es-
pecially at this early season there was no
need for one to suffer from thirst from
his vantage-point his eyes sweeping back
and forth among the peaks and ridges he
picked out the way he should go for the
rest of the day the general direction for
to-morrow and then bucks lead-rope
again in his hand he turned down grad-
ually seeking the headwaters of the next
stream hoping for one of the tiny mead-
ows like the one in which he had camped
last night

  it was four oclock when he started
downward it was nearly dark when he
came to water it was such country as
he had never seen before he fully ex-
pected to start back to-morrow he had
seen no game all day he didnt believe
that either deer or bear came here what
the deuce would they come for they
had more brains than a man besides
two or three times buck had fallen the
next thing would be a broken leg and
no excuse for it

  but nevertheless he must find pas-
turage for the night the horse had had
nothing but the tenderer twigs of young

bushes all day with now and then a hand-
ful of sunflower leaves the dark had
fallen the moon was up before sheldon
found what he sought and he admitted
that he was in luck to find it at all

  the rocky slope broken into little falls
of cliff had ended abruptly there was
an open space timbered only by a few
water-loving trees the red willow and
alder and tall grass sheldon yanked off
pack and pack saddle tethered his horse
and went to drink

  the beauty of the brook-it was scarce-
ly more here near the source-with the
moonlight upon it impressed him tired
as he was there was a sandy bed gravel
strewn unusual here where the thing to
be expected was the water-worn rocks
the current ran placidly widening out to
a willow-fringed pool the grass stood
six inches tall everywhere straight un-
trampled

  sheldon threw himself down to drink
what he had thought the dead white limb
of a tree lying close to the waters edge
was a bone he found another then
the skull half buried in mud and grass
it was the skeleton of a man the
second in one days travel and though
sheldon looked that night and again the
next morning there was nothing to hint
at the cause of this mans death nor was
there a gun an ax a pocket knife or
watch or strip of boot leather-nothing
but the bones which the seasons had
whitened here and there discolored by
the soil into which they had sunk

  when-a man is as hungry and tired as
sheldon was that night he does not
squander time in fruitless fancies he
made a rude meal swiftly rolled into his
blankets and went to sleep but he had
muttered as he rolled over to keep the
moonlight out of his eyes

   were not going back yet buck old
horse if other men got this far we can
go a little farther 

  and though he was too tired to lie
awake and think he could not shut out
of his dreams the fancies bred of the v- 
discoveries the stories which men toi
the fire flower



of the sasnokee-keewan the superstition-
twisted tales of the indians came and
went through his brain distorted into a
hundred guises this was no-luck land
-the land into which few men came the
land from which those few did not re-
turn what got them what killed
them

  out of a vision of some great hideous
ghoulish being which robbed the dead
even to stripping the bodies of their
clothing sheldon woke with a start the
moon shone full in his eyes something
had wakened him he heard it moving
there softly  hesat up grasping his
rifle it was very still again suddenly
he could not locate the sound maybe
it had been buck browsing no buck
was tethered beyond the alders out of
sight no sound came from there the
horse no doubt was dozing

  he even got up vaguely uneasy he
had awakened with the decidedly uncom-
fortable feeling that something was above
him staring down into his face that
on top of the sort of dream which had
been with him all night bred in him a
stubborn curiosity to know what the
something was

  he went quietly and cautiously back
and forth to where buck stood hidden
beyond the trees dozing as he had an-
ticipated across the brook he lifted his
shoulders distastefully as he stepped by
the little pile of bones

  there was nothing it might have been
a cat even a night bird breaking a twig
in the nearest pine sheldon went back
to his bed but he was wide awake now
he lighted his pipe and for an hour sat
up smoking his blanket about his shoul-
ders

  he experienced a strange emotion-
something defying analysis - that he
could catalogue only uncertainly as lone-
liness it was not fear-not strong
enough for that he wanted company it
was with a frown that he checked him-
self from going to bring his horse close
in to his camp that would have been
childish

  he moved a little sitting so that his
back was against the tree

chapter iii

footprints and monuments

it had been in the small hours of the
night that sheldon woke the fire he
had replenished before turning in was
a mere bed of coals he threw a log
across it and at last dozed again he
was up and about wfth the first streaks
of dawn the sky was pearl-pink when
he threw the diamond hitch and was
ready to take up the trail again

  and now calm-thoughted with the light
of day he hesitated should he go on
or should he turn back

  as though for an answer he went to
the crossing where the scattered bones lay
close to the water and the answer to
his question came to him presenting him
a fresh riddle if he had stared wonder-
ingly when he came upon the skull at the
cliffs back yonder now did he stare stupe-
fied there came a vague misty fear
that he was growing fanciful that he was
seeing things which did not exist he
got down on his knees his face not two
feet from the track in the sandy margin
of the creek

  something had passed there last night
the track was very fresh whatever it
was that had wakened him had crossed
here and what was it he sought to
be certain he must be conservative the
track was imperfect the lapping of the
water broke down the little ridges of sand
the passing foot had pushed up the im-
print would be gone entirely in a few
hours and there was no other here for
the grass came close down to the water

  he looked quickly across the stream
there there was a little strip of wet soil
the water boiling unheeded about his
boots he strode across despite the
mans quiet nerves his heart was beating
like mad for he saw that there was a
track here fresh made last night and
another now he did not need to go


all-story weekly

down on his knees the imprints were
clearly outlined as definite as though
drawn upon a sheet of paper

   and they were the tracks of a bare
human foot

   if it had been the big track of a big
man sheldons heart would not have ham-
mered so but it was the track that might
have marked the passing here of a boy of
ten or twelve-or of a girl

    a child or a woman came last night
and looked at me as i slept muttered
the man wonderingly  here god knows
how many miles from anywhere bare-
footed prowling around in the middle of
the night good god the cursed thing
is uncanny

   as he had felt it before but now more
overwhelmingly was his soul oppressed
with the bigness of the solitude about him
he was a pygmy who had blundered into
a giants land he was as a little boy in
the inscrutable presence of majesty and
mystery for a little it seemed to him that
in the still white dawn he stood hemmed
about by the supernatural

   why should there be two white piles of
unburied human bones here in a days
travel why should there be a fresh track
in the wet soil made by a little naked foot
in the night why should every bit of
metallic substance disappear from the
presence of those dead men  why should
his visitor of last night peer down at him
and then slip away with no word

  he frowned unconsciously he was
connecting the bleached skeleton and the
fresh track the man had been dead per-
haps half a dozen years the track had not
been there so many hours he was grow-
ing fanciful with a vengeance

   it was with an effort of will that he
cleared his mind of the wild tales which
he had heard told of the sasnokee-keewan
for a little he sought to believe that he
had been so hopelessly confused in his
sense of direction that he had made a great
curve and had come back to some one of
the outposts of civilization that even now
he was separated only by a ridge or by a
bend in the canon from a lumber-camp or

mining settlement but he knew other-
wise one doesnt find bleaching human
bones lying disinterred upon the edge of a
village

  he sought to follow the tracks across
the bed of the canon and could not they
here were lost in the grass which was not
tall enough to bow to the light passing but
a hundred yards farther down the creek
he came upon them again fresh tracks of
little bare feet clearly outlined in a muddy
crossing the imprint of the heel was
faint the toes had sunk deep

   running grunted sheldon  and
going like the very devil too ill bet

  he went back for buck

   were going on old horse he in-
formed his animal  the lord knows
what were getting into but if a kid of a
boy can make it i guess we can

  for he preferred to think of it as a boy
that a barefoot woman should be running
about here in the heart of the mountains
peering down at a man sleeping scamper-
ing away as he woke- prowling around
as he put it-well it was simpler to think
of a half-grown boy doing it

   or a man stunted in his growth he
thought for the first time

  and the thought remained with him
one could conceive of a man who had
never got his full growth physically who
was stunted mentally as well a half-
crazed half-wild being who fled here who
subsisted in a state little short of savagery
who crept through the moonlit forests
subtly stirred by the weird moon-madness
who hunted like the other wild things

   who slipped up behind a man and
drove a knife into his back who even
made way with the clothing everything
leaving the bones to whiten through sum-
mer and winter as other animals of prey
left the creatures they had killed

  big were the forests limitless seeming
as vast as infinity itself resting heavy and
still upon a mans soul the feeling of
last night the loneliness the sort of un-
named dread came back upon john shel-
don he shook it off with an impatient
imprecation but all day it hovered
the fire flower



about him again he was glad of his
horses companionship

  not a nervous man still he was not
without imagination he began to be op-
pressed with the stillness of the wilder-
ness as he pushed on down-stream
watchful for other tracks he came into a
valley which widened until it was perhaps
a mile across carpeted with grass tim-
bered with the biggest trees he had seen
since leaving belle fortune their boles
five and six and seven feet through every
one a monument of majesty planto  cen-
turies before some long-forgotten ancestor
of john sheldon learned of a land named
america

  there were wide open spaces one
looking through the giant trunks seemed
always looking down the long dimly lit
aisle of the chief temple of the gods of the
world power and venerable age-and
silence a silence so eternal that it
seemed veritably tangible and indomitable

  a man wanted at once to call out to
shatter the heavy stillness which bore
upon his soul and felt his lips grown mute
the creek gurgled here and there a cone
fell or there was the twitter of a bird
these sounds passed through the silence
accentuated it were a part of it a foil to
it but in no way disturbed the ancient
reign of silence

  through this world which might have
come at dawn from the hand of its maker
sheldon pushed on swiftly his brain alive
with a hundred questions and fancies
where there was loose soft dirt where
there was a likely crossing he looked for
tracks and as hour after hour passed he
found nothing to indicate that he was not
as he had imagined until this morning
alone in this part of the sasnokee-keevvan

  and yet he thought that last nights
visitor was ahead cf him true a half-
demented supercunning wild man might
have hidden behind any of those big tree-
trunks might even now be watching him
with feverishly bright eyes sheldon must
chance that he could not seek behind
every tree in this forest of countless thou-
sands but he could feel pretty well as-

sured that the creature he sought had not
fled to east or to west any considerable dis-
tance for on either hand seen here and
there through the trees the sides of the
canon rose to steep cliffs where a man
would have to tcl for hours to make his
way half-way up

  noon came again sheldon was in a
swiftly narrowing gorge no longer was
the world silent about him the roar and
thunder of water shouting and echoing
through the rocky defile nearly deafened
him suddenly his path seemed shut off
in front it was impossible to get a horse
over the ridge here on either hand im-
possible to ford the torsent where many a
treacherous hole hid under boiling water
he lunched and rested here wondering if
he must turn back

  while buck browsed sheldon sought
the way out he turned to his right
climbing the flank of the mountain a
man could go up readily enough at this
spot clambering from one rock to another
the boulders were not unlike easily im-
agined steps placed by the giant deity of
the wild but it took no second look to
be sure that never was the horse foaled
that could follow its master here

  tempting the man there rose from the
ridge a tall bare and barren peak from
which he could hope to have an extended
sweep of world about him he thought
that he could come to it within an hour
and if he were to retrace his steps a little
seeking an escape from the cul de sac into
which the stream had led him it was well
to have a look at the country now from
some such peak

  he had done this before perhaps half a
dozen times always selecting carefully the
peak which promised the widest expanse
of view- with the least brush to struggle
through but never had he had the un-
limited panorama which rewarded him
now at last he was at the top after not
one but two hours hard climb and he
felt that in sober truth he had found the
top of the world that he had surmounted
it that he was less in its realm than in
that of the wide blue sky


all-story weekly

  far below the thunder of the stream he
had just left was lost smothered in the
walls of its own canon stifled among the
forests here there mounted only the
whisper from the imperceptibly stirring
millions of branches not unlike the vague
murmur in a sea shell the peak itself
might have been the altar of the god of
silence

  east west south whence he had come
sheldon saw ridge on ridge peak after
peak no-luck land running away until
with other ridges and peaks it melted into
the sky-line

  looking north and almost at his feet
the mountainside fell away precipitously
he estimated that he was at an altitude
not less than eleven thousand feet there
was snow here plenty of it thawing so
slowly that not nearly all of it would be
gone when the winter came again

  below him in the tumbled boulders
were pockets of snow with bare spaces
and the hardy mountain flowers in the
shallow soil down he looked and down
until it seemed as though the steep-sided
mountains fell away many thousands of
dizzy feet and thre below was the wide
valley all one edge of it meadow-land all
the other edge given over to a mighty
forest and at the jagged line lying be-
tween wood and field a little lake calm
and blue with white rocks along the far-
ther rim

  on all sides of the valley lay the sheer
mountains shutting it in so that a man
might look down and see the beauties be-
neath him and yet hesitate to descend
thinking of the difficulties of getting both
in and out

  sheldon had not forgotten the imprint
of the bare foot nor was he ready to
give up the search he had begun there
being no little stubbornness in the mans
nature

  but he stared long down into the valley
before him thinking of the solitude to be
found there the game to be hunted if a
man sought game thinking that some time
he would make his way down yonder joy-
ing in the thought that his foot would be

the first for years perhaps generations  
even centuries to travel there no 
however he would turn back to wlteiv
buck waited seek the pass that must lead
out and learn if it was fated that he
should know who had made the tracks at
the crossing

  his eyes sweeping now across the field
of tumbled rocks which topped the ridge
at the base of his peak were arrested by
a flat piece of granite resting on top of a
boulder which rose conspicuously above its
neighbors

  a monument

  here where only a second ago he had
told himself that perhaps no other human
foot than his own had come the old sign
of a man-made trail the sign to be read
from afar to last on into eternity for
the shrieking winds of winter and the
racing snows do not budge the flat rock
laid carefully upon flat-topped stone

  was he tricking himself had nature
in some one of her mad moods done this
trick he strode over toit swiftly slid-
ing down the side of the slope up which
he had clambered making his way by
leaps and bounds from rock to rock

  the monument was man-made

  nature doesnt go out of her way as
some man had done to get a block of
granite carry it a hundred yards up-hill
and place it upon a rock of another kind
and shade where it can be the more con-
spicuous

  one monument calls for another in a
trackless field of stone in a moment
farther along the ridge he found the sec-
ond monument he hurried to it yon-
der lower on the slope was the third a
hundred yards farther on the fourth

   he got the trend of the trail now for it
curved only a bit and they ran straight
straight toward the eastern rim of the
valley lying far below him and the other
way the trail ran back toward the canon
from which he had climbed a trail here
in the very innermost heart of the sasno-
kee-keewan where met said there were no
trails

  eagerly he turned back toward the
the fire flower



canon monument after monument he
found leading cunningly between giant
boulders undfcr cliffs down a little up-
ward a little down again slowly gradu-
ally seeking the lower altitude again and
again sheldon lost the way which had but
rock set on rock to indicate it but always
going back he picked it up again

  there were a dozen monuments to show
the way before he came down into the
meadow a mile above the spot where he
had left buck and here also at the base
of the slope fully two hundred yards from
the willows of the creek he found a fresh
green willow-rod it had been dropped
here not more than a few hours ago for
the white wood where the bark had been
torn away was not dried out a bit of the
bark itself he could tie into a knot without
breaking it and the stick had been cut
with a sharp knife the smooth end show-
ing how one stroke had cut evenly through
the half-inch branch

   my wild man came this way was
sheldons eager thought  he knew the
trail over the mountain and has gone on
ahead and that knife of his-

  he shuddered in spite of himself and
again cursed himself for getting what he
called  nerves but he thought that it
was a fair bet that same knife had been
driven into the backs of at least two men

  he went back for his horse walking
swiftly three hours had slipped away
since noon but he told himself that he
was not  burning daylight he had
found a way over the mountain a way he
believed his horse could go with him
and if luck was good hed camp to-night
in the valley down into which he had
looked from the peak

  and somewhere far ahead of him per-
haps not a thousand feet away watching
him from behind some tree or rock was his
 wild man  he was beginning to be
certain that it was a man a little fellow
dwarfed in body and mind and soul and
yet-

  and yet the track might have been that
of a boy of ten or of a woman right
then he swore that he was going to find out

whose track that was before he turned his
back on the sasnokee-keewan

   id never be able to get it out of my
head if i lived to be a thousand years old
if i didnt get a look at the thing he as-
sured himself  thank god its early in
the season

  when he stopped to rest he already
had the habit of keeping his back to a tree

chapter iv

the chase

again sheldon traveled on until after
nightfall and moonrise even the
long twilight of these latitudes had
faded when finally following the monu-
ments of an old old trail he came down
into the valley which he had overlooked
from the peak

  horse and man were alike tired and
hungry they found a small stream and
in the first grove where there was sufficient
grass sheldon made his camp for the
night and the fact that he was tired was
not the only reason not even the chief
reason perhaps that he did not build his
custorriary camp-fire

  he ate a couple of cold potatoes a
handful of dried venison a raw onion and
was content he even decided that hed
manage without a fire in the morning
the smoke of his fire last night had no
doubt told of his coming he meant now
to see his wild man before the wild man
saw him so he put it to himself as he
tethered buck in the heart of the grove
and made his own bed and he slept as a
man must sleep so often out on the trail
 with one eye open

  through the night he dozed waking
many times he must have slept soundly
just before morning with the dawn he
woke again and did not go to sleep the
uneasy sense was with him as it had been
before that something had wakened him
he sat up listening

  only silence and the twitterings of the
birds awaking with him and still a
sound echoing in his ears which he could


all-story weekly

not believe had been only the unreal mur-
mur in a dream he drew on his boots
and slipped out of his blankets he was
wide awake and with no wish to go to
sleep again turning toward the creek
he stopped suddenly

  there was a sound far off faint only
dimly audible a sound which was at once
like the call of some wild thing some forest
creature in distress and yet like the cry of
no animal sheldon had ever heard he
strained his ears to hear it was gone
sinking into the silence and yet he had
heard and his blood was tingling

  he snatched up his rifle and ran down-
stream dodging behind trees as he went
pausing now and then to peer through the
early light hurrying on again

   this time if it is you mr wild
man he muttered  ill be the one who
does the creeping up on you

  two hundred yards he went hearing
nothing then again it came a faint
sobbing cry which as before stirred his
blood strangely it was so human and
yet not human he thought less than
human more than human-which in-
articulate wordless a bubbling cry of fear
or of physical suffering the call was
gone sinking as it had sunk before and
again he ran on his pulses bounding

  with sudden abruptness before he was
aware of it he had shot out of the tim-
bered land and upon the edge of the little
blue lake he had looked down upon yes-
terday afternoon not a hundred paces
from him the breeze-stirred ripples of the
lake were lapping upon the sandy shore

  here was one of those white rocks he
had marked at the lakes side and here
upon the rock arms tossed out toward the
sun which even as he paused breathless
shot a first glimmer above the tree-tops
was  his wild man

  clad only in the shaggy skin of a brown
bear which was caught over one shoulder
under the other stitched at the sides with
thongs arms bare legs feet bare the
body a burnished copper the hair long
and blown about the shoulders was a-
girl

  he gasped as he saw still uncertain a
dead limb cracked under his feet and
quick as a deer starts wfien he hears a
mans step she whirled about fronting
him he saw her face clearly and the arm
lifted raising his rifle fell lax at his side
for surely she was young and unless the
light lied she was beautiful

  about her forehead caught into her
hair were strange red flowers unknown
to him her arms were round and brown
and unthinkably graceful in their swift
movements she was as alert as any wild
thing he had ever seen and had in every
gesture that inimitable swift grace which
belongs by birthright to the denizens of
the woodlands

  only an instant did they confront each
other thus the man stricken with a wonder
which was half incredulity the girl still
under the shock of surprise and then
with a little cry unmistakably of fear she
had leaped from the rock landed lightly
upon the grassy sod and wafe running
along the lake-shore her hair floating be-
hind her flowers dropping from it as she
ran

  and john sheldon the instant of un-
certainty passed was running mightily
after her shouting

  not until long long afterward did the
affair strike him as having in it certain of
the elements of comedy now god knows
it was all sober seriousness he shouted
to her inenglish crying  stop i wont
hurt you he shouted in an indian dia-
lect of which scraps came to him at his
need and then breathless he gave over
calling

  she had turned her face a little and he
was near enough to hazard the guess that
she was frightened and that at every shout
of his the fear of him but leaped the
higher in the throbbing breast under the
bearskin so he just settled down o
good hard running he john sheldon
who in all the days of his life had never
so much as run after a girl even figur-
atively speaking

  even above the surge of a score of other
emotions this one stood up in his heart-
the fire flower



he counted himself as good a man as other
men and this girl was running away from
him as an antelope runs away from a
plodding plow-horse

  he saw her clear a fallen log leaping
lightly and when he came to it he mar-
veled at its size and as he leaped feared
for a second that he was not going to
make it already she had gained on him
she was still gaining she looked over her
shoulder again he fancied that the
startled terror had gone that she was less
afraid being confident that she was the
fleeter

   and yet deuce take it he grunted
in a sort of anger  i cant shoot her

  the little bare brown feet seemed to
him to have wings so light and fleet were
they so smoothly and with such amazing
speed did they carry her on seeing that
she would infallibly distance him and slip
away from him into the woods where he
could never hope to come upon her again
he lifted his voice once more shouting
and then he cursed himself for a fool
for at the first sound of his voice boom-
ing out loudly she ran but the faster

  then suddenly sheldon thought that he
saw his chance yonder a few hundred
yards ahead of her was a wide clearing
and in it he saw that a long arm of the
lake was flung far out to the right she
would have to turn there he did not
wait but turned out now hoping to cut
her off before she could come around the
head of the arm of the lake which no
doubt in her excitement she had for-
gotten

  straight on she ran he saw her flash
through a little clump of shrubs close to
the waters edge saw that she was going
straight on and then guessed her pur-
pose she was not going to turn out she
had disappeared behind the trees he
thought that he had seen her leap far out
just a glint of sun on the bronze of her
outflung arms

  still he pounded on turning to the right
certain that he could come to the far side
before she could swim it but the arm of
the lake extended farther than he had an-

ticipated already she was far out swim-
ming as he had seen no man swim in all his
life and he knew that the race was hers
panting he stopped and watched saw the
flashing arms the dark head with the hair
floating behind her

   its a wonder that bearskin doesnt
drown her was his thought

  and then coming close to where she
had disappeared behind the bushes he
saw the bearskin lying at the edge of the
lake the water lapping it and john
sheldon who seldom swore never when
the occasion did not demand it said
simply

   well ill be damned i most cer-
tainly will be damned

  he picked the thing up and looked out
across the lake just in time to catch the
glint of the sun upon a pair of bronze
arms thrown high up as though in tri-
umph as his  quarry speeding through
the screen of willows disappeared again

   the little devil he muttered a lit-
tle in rage a great deal in admiration

  carrying the trailing bearskin still
warm from the touch of her body he
turned again to the right trudging on
stubbornly along the arm of the lake
there was no particular reason why he
should carry the bearskin but on he
went with it a trophy of the chase and
in his heart was as stubborn a determina-
tion as had ever grown up in that stub-
born stronghold hed find her hed get
the explanation of this madness if it was
the last thing in the world he ever did

  and then suddenly lacking neither im-
agination nor chivalric delicacy he felt
his face growing red with embarrassment
the situation seemed to him to be pre-
senting its difficulties

chapter v

the tomb of dreams

sheldon gave over asking himseif
unanswerable questions and hurried
on around the end of the lake and
into the forest beyond where the lithe rac-


all-story weekly

ing figure had shot through the shadows
like a shimmering gleam of light

  he found her trail and followed it eas-
ily for it ran in a straight line and
through a meadow where the grass stood
tall and had broken before her

   only infrequently did it swerve to right
or left to avoid one of the big trees in her
path as sheldon went on he saw many
a field flower or tuft of grass which she
had bent in her phssing straighten up it
seemed to him almost that they were sen-
tient little creatures seeking to tell him
 she went this way

  he was fully prepared to follow the
track of her wild flight across miles if
need be his one hope being that she con-
tinued in a meadow like this which held
the sign of her going he was no longer
running at the top speed with which the
chase had begun nor was he walking as
he had been for a moment while she
swam his gait had settled down into a
steady hammering pace which he could
keep up for an hour his one hope being
now to win with his greater endurance

  for the most part his eyes kept to the
ground that he might not lose the trail
and much precious time finding it again
only now and then would he glance up
to right or left to make certain that she
had not turned out at last to double back
or seek shelter in the mountain slopes

  and as he came plunging with accele-
rated speed down a gentle incline swing-
ing about a grove of young firs which
stood with outflung branches interlacing
so that they made a dense dark wall his
eyes were upon the ground watchful for
her trail

  for a second he lost it then without
checking his speed he found it turning
againa very little this time to the left to
avoid a second thickly massed group of
young firs

  he ran around this swerved again a
very little as he came upout of the hollow
and to a flat open space saw the track
leading straight across the level sward
entered a larger grove of firs lost the
trail for a dozen steps ran on shot out

of the grove and-came to a dead halt
staring in utter amazement

  if at that moment he had been asked
who in all the wide world was the simon-
pure king of fools he would have an-
swered in unqualified vehemence  john
sheldon

  with a bearskin which he must admit
he had acquired rather in defiance of con-
vention in one hand with a rifle in the
other his hat back yonder somewhere
under the limb which had knocked it off
looking he was sure such a fool as never a
man looked before he was standing with
both feet planted squarely in the middle
of the main street of a town

  he had more than a suspicion that in
some mysterious aivay he had gotten very
drunk without knowing it he was by
no means positive that he was not a rav-
ing maniac if he had been obliged to
tell his name at that bewildering second
it is a toss whether he would have said
 king sheldon or  john fool

  his mind was a blank to all emotions
and sensations save the one that reddened
his face if a man had ever foretold that
he would some day see a girl out in the
woods upon a lake shore where no doubt
she was going to take a bath that he
would first scare her half out of her wits
and then wildly pursue her for a quarter
of a mile shouting god knows what mad-
ness at her that hed grab up the morn-
ing robe which shed worn and come wav-
ing it after as he ran that hed rush on
so blindly that he didnt know what he
was doing until he was right square in the
middle of a town-well it would be mild
to say that he would have dubbed that
man an incurable idiot

  and yet in front of him stood a house
builded compactly of logs and rudely
squared timbers that might have stood
there half of a century to the right
stood a house to the left a house
straight ahead ran a narrow street houses
upon the right houses upon the left in
that blindly groping moment he felt that
he had never seen sd many houses all at
once in all the days of his life and yet
the fire flower



he was no stranger to san francisco or
vancouver nor yet new york

  he hardly knew what to expect first
a great shout of laughter as men and wo-
men saw him or a shot from a double-
barreled shotgun 

   if shes got a father or a brother
and he doesnt shoot me he muttered
 hes no man

   but there came neither shout of laugh-
ter nor shot of gun as the first wave of
stupefaction surged over him and passed
leaving him a little more clear-thoughted
there came the inclination to draw back
swiftly into the trees before he was seen

   but he stood stone still for at last it
was evident that there was no one to see
there was the town unmistakably a typ-
ical rude mining camp but it was still
deserted a veritable city of desolation

  nowhere did a rock chimney send up
its smoke to stain the clear sky the
street was empty grown up with grass
and weeds and even young trees no
childs voice in laughter or man or wo-
mans voice calling no dogs bark to vi-
brate through the stillness which was ab-
solute no sound of ax on wood or of
hammer or of horses hoofs no stirring
object upon the steps which were rotting
away nor at door or window

   no sign of life though he turned this
way and that searching everywhere the
wilderness was pushing in again where
once man had come vanquishing it be-
fore him was the most drearily desolate
scene that had ever stood out before his
eyes in some strange way it was unut-
terably indescribably sad

  he came on again slowly obeying an
impulse which he did not consciously
recognize he stepped softly as a man
does in a death chamber his soul was
oppressed his spirit drooped suddenly as
the atmosphere of the abandoned camp
fell upon it

   by daylight gloom haunted the tenant-
less buildings by night here would be
melancholias own demesne nowhere
else in the world does one find that ter-
rible sadness which spreads its somber

wings in the abode of man long given over
to the wild to be a lair for its soft-footed
children

  more questions demanding answers
and all unanswerable he sought to
throw off the influence which had fallen
upon him and went on more swiftly seek-
ing the girl who had fled here had she
stopped in one of these ruined houses
was one of them  home  to her who
lived here with her and why were
they like himself chance comers newly
arrived or did they like the log houses
belong to this land were they like every-
thing of man here being drawn back into
the mighty arms of the wild

  this part of the world the fastnesses
stretghing from belle fortune to rum-
inoff shanty on the gold river was what
he and his fellows glibly called  new
country what country on the earth is
new what nook or corner has not once
known the foot of man and his conquer-
ing hand and given time what bit of
the world has not in the end hurled its
conqueror out trodden down his monu-
ments made dust of his labors and
crowned his hearths in creeping vines
and forgetfulness wresting it all back
from him

  the thoughts which came to him had
their own way in a mind which was half
given to the search resumed questions
came involuntarily he did not pause or
seek to answer them hurriedly he went
up and down turning out for fallen tim-
bers circling tangled growths

  at every open door and window he
looked in eagerly noting less the sagging
panels and broken shutters than the dark
interiors many roofs had fallen many
walls were down many buildings were but
rectangular heaps of ruins grown over
grass but other houses builded solidly
of great logs with sturdy steep roofs
stood defiantly

   there was a time when hundreds of
men lived here he thought as he has-
tened on  men and women maybe and
perhaps children why did they go like
this even a town may die like a man

even its name be forgotten in a generation
or two

  pusning through a rear yard long ago
so reclaimed by the wilderness that he
must fight his way through brush shoul-
der high he came out suddenly upon a
path it ran broad and straight toward
the lake there upon a little knoll until
now hidden from him by the trees was
the largest building of the village the
one in a state of the best preservation
the path ran to the door on either side
of the doorstep cleared of weeds was a
space in which grew tall red flowers he
stopped a moment his heart beating fast

  the door was closed the windows were
covered with heavy shutters he came
on again walking warily his eyes every-
where at once what should a man ex-
pect here in the dead city of the sasno-
kee-keewan a rifle ball as readily as
anything else and yet he came on
steadily his own rifle ready

  at last he stood not ten steps from the
closed door wondering some one lived
here so much was certain the well-worn
path told it eloquently then too there
were signs of digging about the little
flower garden a womans work-hers
and she herself was she in there now

  i might go up to the door and knock
he muttered  the regular way when
you want to know if any one is at home
but i have precious little desire to be-
come pile of bleached bones number
three

  he lifted his voice and called a star-
tled squirrel that had been watching him
curiously vanished with a sudden whisk
of tail and a big woodpecker upon a dis-
tant falling wall cocked a pair of bright
eyes at him impertinently sheldon wait-
ed turned this way and that called again
then again louder

   devil take it he grunted in sudden
irritation  theres got to be an end of
this tomfoolery if i have to do with
crazy folk i might as well know it now
as any time

  he went up the two steps to the door
and rapped sharply still there came no

answer he rapped again and then put
his hand to the latch the door was fas-
tened from within

   whos in there he called  cant
you answer me

  his voice died away into silence the
woodpecker went back to his carpenter-
ing a hush lay over the world about
him

  he called again explained that his in-
tentions were friendly argued with the
silence pleaded and then lost his temper

   open he shouted  or by the lord
ill beat your old door off its hinges
then for the first time he thought that
he heard a sound from within the gentle
fall of a foot as some one moved his
head turned a little listening eagerly he
heard no other sound

  lifting his rifle he drove the butt hard
against the door it creaked rattled and
held he struck again harder

  his rifle was swung back for the third
blow when a voice answered him the
voice of a girl clear but troubled uncer-
tain thrilling him strangely with-the
note in it he had heard this morning when
he awoke suggesting as it did the wild

   wait said the voice  wait-a-
little-while

  to describe the voice to put a name
to the subtle quality of it which made it
different from any other voice sheldon
had ever heard was as impossible as to
describe the perfume of a violet to one
who has no olfactory nerve

  but in one respect her speech was defi-
nitely distinctive in that each word came
separately enunciated slowly spoken
with the vaguest hint of an effort as
though her tongue were not used to shap-
ing itself to words at all

  all right answered sheldon  thats
fair how long do you want me to wait
 just-little-bit came the clear an-
swer the little pauses seeming to indicate
that she was seeking always for the right
word  not-damn-long

   oh said sheldon

   go over by that house that is all
broken continued the voice  then i
the fire flower



will open the door there came a pause
then the words uttered with great impres-
siveness  do what i say almighty quick
or ill cut your white liver out

  sheldon obeyed wondering more than
ever as he went he dropped the bear-
skin close to the door

   im putting your-your dress where
you can reach out and get it he said as
he went

  there was no answer

chapter vi

king midas and napoleon

as directed sheldon went back down
the knoll until he stood near a
tumble-down shanty there some
fifty or sixty feet from the sturdy log
house from which he did not remove his
eyes as he went the door opened a very
little just enough for a pair of alert and
vigilant eyes to watch him

  when he stopped he was prepared to
see a round brown arm slip out to re-
trieve the fallen bearskin but instead
the door opened quickly there stepped
out what at first glance seemed to be a
boy clad in mans trousers boots and
terribly torn and patched blue shirt but
her hair lay in two loosely plaited braids
across her shoulders and hardly the sec-
ond glance was needed to assure him that
here was no boy but she who had fled be-
fore him

  in coming out the door had opened just
far enough for her to pass out then had
been closed so quickly that he had had
no glimpse of the cabins interior she
stood still a ht nd upon the latch behind
her facing him

  sheldon raised his hand to lift his hat
remembered and said quietly

   good morning

   good morning she repeated after
him

  he was near enough to guess something
of what lay in her eyes certainly a
strange sort of curiosity underlay her
penetrating gaze which seemed in all

     	a-s

frankness to search deeply for all that a
long look could tell her

  and it seemed to him under this look
lay another that hinted to him that shed
whirl jerk the door open and disappear
in a flash if he so much a stook a step
forward so he moved back another pace
or two to reassure her leaning against a
fragment of wall

  if she regarded him with fixed intent-
ness no less did the man stare at her
there was every sign of hasty dressing
she must have drawn on the first gar-
ments falling to her hurrying hands the
boots were unquestionably many sizes too
large trousers and shirt weremonstrous-
ly ill-fitting and even so the amazing
thing was that she was most undeniably
pretty and burned as she was from the
sun she was not an indian her hair was
a sunkissed brown her eyes he fancied
were gray

   i am sorry said sheldon after a
considerable silence  that i frightened
you just now

  her gaze did not waver lost nothing
of its steady searching intentness he
could see no change of expression upon
her slightly parted lips she offered no
remark to his but stood waiting

   i think he went on in a little put-
ting all of the friendliness he could man-
age into his voice  that i was at first
startled as much as you id hardly ex-
pected to stumble upon a girl hfre you
know

  if she did know she didnt take the
trouble to tell him that she did there
was something positively disconcerting in
the scrutiny to which she so openly sub-
jected him

   you see he continued his monologue
stoutly determined to overlook any little
idiosyncrasies  it was a surprise to me
to see your tracks in the first place and
then to come upon you like that-and to
find this old settlement here- why i
had always thought that no man had ever
so much as builded him a dugout in the
sasnokee-keewan

  he stopped suddenly it struck him


all-story weekly

as ridiculous this was he babbling on
while she stood there looking at him like
that certainly he had given her ample
opportunity to say something yet she
seemed to have not the slightest inten-
tion of opening her mouth still she
watched him as one might watch some
new strange animal

   whats the matter he demanded
sharply her attitude beginning to irritate
him  cant you talk

   yes just the monosyllable clearly
enunciated she had answered his ques-
tion he hoped she would go on but she
made no offer to do so

   well cried the man  why dont
you youre not keeping still because
we havent been introduced are you
good lord why do you look at me like
i was part of a side show didnt you
ever see a man before im not trying to
flirt with you say something

  his nerves had been tense and at best
his temper was likely to flare out now
and then he wished for a second that
she was a few years younger so that he
could take her across his knee

   flirt she repeated after him lift-
ing her brows she shook her head
 what must i say

  the suspicion came upon him that she
was secretly enjoying herself at his ex-
pense and he said quickly

   i should think you could find a num-
ber of things to say here where a stranger
doesnt come every day you might even
ask me inside and strain no sense of con-
vention you might offer me a cup of
coffee and nobody would accuse you of
being forward you might tell me where
i am and what town this is-or was you
might tell me something about the rest
of your party where they are and when
i can have a talk with some one who is
willing to talk

  for a moment she seemed to be pon-
dering what he had said then as bid-
den she answered speaking slowly tak-
ing up point by point

   you cannot come inside i would
lock the door i would shoot you with

a big gun i have in there it is like yours
but bigger coffee she shook her
head as she had before  i dont know
what that is this town is johnnys
luck i have no one else for you to talk
to you must go away

  sheldon stared at her incredulously
the short laugh with which he meant to
answer her was a bit forced unconvincing
in his own ears the girl watched him
with the same keen speculative eyes

   you dont mean for me to believe
that you are here all alone he de-
manded

  she hesitated then she answered in
her own words of a moment ago

   i have no one else for you to talk to
 thats pure nonsense you know he
retorted bluntly she made no reply

   i got off my trail and blundered into
this place he went on presently  im
going on out presently im not going to
trouble you or any of your people

   that is nice was the first remark
voluntarily given sheldon flushed

   just the same he said a little stern-
ly  im not going out like a blind fool
without finding out a thing or two if
youre up to some kind of a lark it strikes
me that its run on about long enough
theres precious little use in your pre-
tending to be the only one in here

  by now he knew better than to expect
her to speak except in reply to a direct
question and so continued

   will you tell me who you are

   i am paula

   paula he said  paula what 

   just paula quietly

   but your other name

   i have just one name i am paula
for the life of him he did not know
what to make of her there was the pos-
sibility that she was playing with him in
that case she played her part amazingly
well there was the possibility that she
spoke in actual as well as in seeming sin-
cerity

  whois your father he asked ab-
ruptly

  and at her answer calmly quietly
the flre flower



spoken he was startled into the suspicion
of the third possibility-madness

  for she had answered gravely

   he is a king his name is midas
from under gathered brows his eyes
probed at her like knives was she hoax-
ing him or was she mad unless she
was crazed why did she so cleverly seek
to appear so what maid stands out be-
fore a man stranger though he be and
poses to him in the light of an insane
woman if she were not mad then why
was she striving to make him believe her
so then why

  he had come to her for answers and
he but got new questions that were as
yet unanswerable when he spoke again
it was thoughtfully

   why do you tell me your father is
king midas he asked

   because you said to me  who is
your father 

   and you just naturally and truthful-
ly tell me he is a king whats the use
of this nonsense

  she made no reply there was a little
silence before he spoke there came to
him clearly the sound as of some heavy
object falling upon bare floor within the
cabin

   there is some one else in there he
exclaimed impatiently  who is it
why dont they come out and answer me
sensibly if you wont

  positively now there was a quick look
of alarm upon her face for a second
he thought that she was going to whisk
back into the house and then she cried
hurriedly

   he is in there-yes the king
and napoleon is there and richard and
johnny lee shall i throw open the
door for them to put out their guns and
shoot you

  great heavens gasped sheldon
and to her wonderingly  why should
they shoot me what harm am i doing
any one

   i know  her voice until now so
quiet suddenly rang out passionately
 you come from the world outside

from over there she threw out her arm
widely toward the south  you come
over the mountains from the world out-
side where all men are bad where
they fight like beasts for what we have
here where they steal and kill and
cheat and lie and snatch from one an-
other like hungry coyotes and wolves
you come here to steal and kill i
know havent others come before you
bad men creeping in from the outside
a strange sort of shiver ran through
sheldons blood but with quick in-
spiration he asked her

   and what has happened to them
they died was the unhesitating
answer  as you too will die and
quick if you do not go out and leave
us i should have killed you last night
while you slept but you startled me
i had never seen a man like you the
others had beards you had no hair upon
your face and for a little i thought you
were a woman another like me and i
was glad and then you woke-and i
ran i should have killed you-

  she broke off pantipg her breast
rising and falling tumultuously her
eyes were bright and hard her tanned
cheeks flushed

   shed drive a knife into a man
sleeping and never turn a hair was
sheldons silent comment

  i tell you to go she flung at him
again  before i have you killed like
the others what do you want here
what is here that belongs to you you
are looking for gold i know that is
what the others wanted do you want
to die as they died

  listen to me interrupted the man
sharply  i didnt come here to hurt
you i didnt come for gold i came
because i lost the trail

   liar she cried out at him
silenced he could but stand and stare
at her and slowly all sense of anger at
her words died out of him and into his
heart welled a great pity for no longer
did he wonder if she but played a part
or was mad


all-story  weekly

  again through the brief silence
there came to him faintly the sound of
something stirring within the cabin he
listened eagerly hoping to guess what it
was moving beyond the door she guard-
ed so jealously but the sound had
come and gone and it was very still
again

  was there one person in there or
were there two or more man or
woman surely there was some one
surely there could not be two mad peo-
ple here then why did the one in
there hold back letting her dispute en-
trance to the stranger why was there
not another face to show at a crack of
the door or at a window

  questions questions and questions
and no one to answer them but a mad
girl who said that she was paula daugh-
ter of king midas no not even paula
to answer for suddenly she had jerked
the door open slipped inside and
sheldon heard the sound as of a heavy
bar dropping into wooden sockets

  he was quite alone in the empty
street of a town that had lived and died
and been forgotten and never in all his
life had he been more uncertain what
next to do

chapter vii

the company paula kept

less for the breakfast without which
he had left camp than realizing the
wisdom to caching his blankets and
provisions sheldons first step was back
toward the spot where buck grazed

  if those within the old cabin meant
to seek to escape talking with him they
would not stir forth immediately but
would peer forth many times cautiously
to make certain that in reality he was
not watching from shelter of the grove
he could dispose of his pack eat
hastily and be again in front of the
cabin within less than an hour

  he drew back swiftly made sure with
a glance over his shoulder that the door

had remained shut the shutters of the
windows undisturbed slipped through
the fir grove and then broke into a trot
headed up the meadow

  selecting some tinned goods hurriedly
he rolled everything else blankets and
all in his canvas found a hiding place
which suited him in a tiny rocky gorge
piled rocks on top of the cache and re-
turned for his horse buck he led
deeper into the forest that lay upon
the eastern rim of the valley and left
there where there was pasture and
water hobbling him for fear of the long
tie rope getting tangled about the bushes
which grew under the trees

  when the pack-saddle had been tossed
into a clump of these bushes he felt
reasonably sure that his outfit was safe
for the short time he expected to be
away from it then eating as he went
he turned back to the town which
paula the daughter of midas called
johnnys luck

  as he came again into the abandoned
street he examined each ruined cabin
as he passed it stopping for all that
still stood making his way to the door
through more than one weed-grown
yard slipping in at door or window
where the buildings were still upon the
rim of being habitable

  nor were his puzzles lessened at the
signs everywhere that men when they
had given over these dwellings had
gone in wild haste they had not taken
fittings and furnishings with them at
least nothing cumbersome had gone out

  he could picture the exit from the
homes that had been almost a frenzied
rushing out of doors flung rudely open
and left to gape stupidly after their de-
parting masters yes and mistresses
for it was written in dusty signs that
women too had walked here and had
fled as though from some dread menace

  but to a man knowing the vivid tales
of the western country as sheldon knew
them here was a mystery which must
soon grow clear as the memory of half-
forgotten stories came back to him
the fire flower



  he saw rude chairs and tables stand-
ing idly under dust of many many years
accumulation chairs which had been
pushed back violently as men sprang to
their feet some overturned and left to
sprawl awkwardly until as time ran by
they fell apart and in due time came
to disintegrate as all other things phys-
ical crumble in the world

  he saw pictures tacked to-walls knew
that they had been cheap colored prints
or newspaper illustrations thick earth-
enware dishes and utensils of iron and
tin upon more than one stone hearth
invariably the homes of spiders cup-
boards where food had lain and rotted
discoloring the unpainted wood a
thousand little homely articles which in
the ordinary course of house vacating
would have been packed and taken
away

  johnnys luck had been a mining
town for no other conceivable reason
would men have made a town here at
all as long ago as johnnys luck gave
every evidence of having been builded
and its life had been that of many
another village of the far-out land in the
days of the early mining madness

  rumor of gold strong rumor of gold
had brought many men and some few
women most of the latter what the
world calls bad some few perhaps what
god calls good to answer the call and
the lure

  they had been so sure that they had
builded not mere shanties but solid
homes of logs they had remained here
for many months-and then no doubt
the bottom had fallen out of johnnys
luck the vein had pinched out the
gold was gone

  and then so did sheldon reconstruct
the past from the dust-covered ruin
about him word had come to johnnys
luck of another strike out yonder
somewhere beyond the next ridge per-
haps perhaps a hundred miles away
that word had come into camp mys-
teriously as word of gold always travels
men had whispered it to their  pard-

ners  and in its own fashion the word
had spread

  there had been that first attempt at
stealing away by stealth as some few
hoped to be miles from camp before
every one knew others had seen men
in that day attributed but the one motive
to hasty stealthy departure

  the stealing away had turned into a
mad rush some one a nervous man
or an excitable woman had cried out
the magic word  gold and then
homes had been deserted with a speed
which was like frenzy a few precious
belongings had been snatched up chairs
and even tables overturned and down
the long street of johnnys luck they
had gone fighting for the place at the
fore the whole camp and for some
reason they had never come back per-
haps they had come to learn that
johnnys luck was unlucky

  it was simple enough after all he told
himself as he came at length to the base
of the knoll upon which stood the cabin
into which the girl had gone like
everything else in the world simple
enough when once one understood

  up and down the pacific coast from
tidewater some mountainous hundreds
of miles inland how many towns had
grown up like johnnys luck almost in
a night only to be given over to the
wild again deserted and forgotten in an-
other night there are many some still
lifting vertical walls some mere mounds
of grass-grown earth where one may dig
and find a childs tin cup or a broken
whisky bottle

  simple enough when one understood
he pondered staring at the closed door
but what explanation lay just here this
girl could not have been born when
johnnys luck flourished whence had
she come and why

  it was broad morning the sun rising
clear above the last of the trees so that
its light fell upon the two beds of red
flowers on the doorstep lay the bear-
skin as he had left it from the rock
ard dirt chimney smoke rose coming


all-story weekly

closer to the house he heard now and
then a sound of one walking within he
fancied that he heard a voice hardly
more than a whisper

  his purpose taken he stood watching
waiting if he had to stay here until
some one came out if he were forced
to linger here all day camp here to-
night he was not going away until the
last question was answered

   id be a brute to go off and leave
her alone here he told himself stub-
bornly  or perhaps worse than
alone the poor little devil wont know
how to take care of herself god knows
what shes up against as it is any-
way here i stay

  the windows remained shuttered the
door stood unopened the smoke from
the chimney grew a faint gray line
against the sky and was gone it was
death-still in the house an hour passed
and sheldon striding back and forth on
the watch for a possible attempt to slip
away through a door which he had
found at the rear grew impatient

  another hour and never a sound
such watching and waiting with noth-
ing discovered to reward his patience
was the death of what little patience was
a part of john sheldons makeup

   ive waited long enough he mut-
tered

  he strode straight between the beds
of red flowers up the three steps made
of logs and rapped at the door the
sounds died away  as all sounds seemed
to do here swallowed by the silence
echoless as though killed by thick walls
so he knocked again calling out

   ive no habit of prying into other
peopless business but i am not used to
being treated like a leper either open
the door or i shall batter it down
hurried whispers within then silence
he waited for a moment then swing-
ing back his rifle he drove the butt
mightily against the door close to the
latch there was a little cry then
paulas voice he was suie a cry of pure
fear

   poor little thing he thought  she
thinks im going to kill her

  but he struck again and the thick
panel of the door dry and old cracked
again and paulas voice again this
time calling

  wait wait and i will come

   no he answered in flat stubborn-
ness  ill not wait i am coming in-
side open the door

   you cannot you must not what
is it that you want here what have
we that you would take away from us
go back into the world outside go
quick-before we kill you

  he laughed savagely

   you are not going to kill me and
weve talked nonsense long enough i
tell you i am not going to hurt you
who is in there with you why doesnt
he talk	

  whispers quick sharp agitated but
no answer sheldon waited grew sud-
denly angry and struck with all his
might the door cracked again two
long cracks showed running up and
down but the bar within held and the
cracks gave no glimpse of the rooms
interior he struck once more

   wait  paulas voice again strangely
quiet  i am coming

  he stepped back a little standing
just at the side of the door his rifle
clubbed and lifted there was so little
telling what next to expect here in a
land which seemed to him a land of
madness he heard her at the door

  she was taking down the bar he
was sure of it but why was she so
long about it and it seemed to him
that in the simple process she made an
unnecessary amount of noise and she
kept talking rapidly now her voice
raised her utterances almost incoherent
as though she labored under some tre-
mendous excitement

   dont you see i am opening th
door but you must step back down
the steps ill hear you going i am
afraid you might reach out and seize
me just a minute now only a minute
the fire flower



i dont hear you though you must go
down the steps then i will come out
then you can come in i am hurrying-
hurrying as fast as i can

  it only whetted his suspicion what
was going on just ten feet from him
beyond that wall there was no loop-
hole through which an out-thrust gun
barrel could menace him he had seen to
that and if a gun was thrust out as
the door opened he could strike first he
was ready but if he went back down
the steps-

  suddenly he knew he heard a little
scraping sound which low as it was
rose above the sound of paulas young
voice it was at that other door at the
back some one was there opening it
cautiously the forest came down close
to the house at the back

  he leaped down the steps and ran
around the side of the house of no mind
to have them give him the slip this way

  hurry paula had heard him had
guessed his purpose as he theirs and was
screaming  hurry he is coming
the rear door little used perhaps had
caught but as sheldon raced around
the corner of the cabin the door was
flung violently open and an astonishing-
ly wildly uncouth figure shot out
making strange horrible sounds in his
throat as he ran

  it was a man so tall and gaunt that
it seemed rather the caricature of a man
clad in shirt and trousers the flying
feet were bare the head was bare and
from it the hair long and snow white
floated out behind him the beard
long and unkempt was as white as the
hair of his head

  his eyes-sheldon saw them looking
for one brief moment straight into his
own-were the burning brilliant eyes of
a madman had there been doubt in
the case of the girl there was room for
nt doubt here the man was only too
clearly a maniac

  just the one look into the terrible eyes
was given to sheldon the man ran as
paula had run this morning but with a

greater more frantic speed crying out
strange broken fragments of words he
dashed into the trees and sheldon
stopped

  paula was still in the house with
little chance to overtake the man with
no wish to have them both escape him
sheldon whirled and running with all the
speed in him came to the open door
it slammed in his face paula too had
just reached it but not yet had she
had time to make it fast he threw his
weight against it he could hear her
panting and crying out in terror the
door flew open he was in the house

  but now she was running to the other
door the bar there was still in its
place her hands lost no time now but
whipped it out dropped it clattering to
the bare floor jerked the door open

  she was on the steps outside when
sheldons arms closed about her she
screamed and tore at his arms as he
swept her off of her feet he marveled
at the strength in her he felt the
muscles of her body against his and
they were like iron but he held her

  she struck at his face beating at him
with hard little fists but he held her
and at that she had in her all the fierce-
ness of a mountain cat she was pan-
therine in her rage that flashed at him
from her eyes in the supple strength of
her body in all the fierceness which he
had whipped to the surface

  though she struggled he brought her
back into the cabin he even managed
to slam the door and while he held her
and she beat at him to drop the bar
back into place he carried her across
the room to a tumbled bunk there and
threw her down upon it standing be-
tween her and the rear door still open

  suddenly she was quite still she lay
there her breast shaking to the rage and
fear that shone in her eyes she did
not seek to move but lay breathing
deeply watching him

  from somewhere far out in the woods
there floated to them a strange cry bil-
lowing weirdly through the stillness

   sheldon stepped acros the room and
 picked up his rifle

chapter viii

john sheldon-magician

 she stirred a very little then lay still
 again pantherine the word de-
 scribed her as no other word could
 do even in the little movement there
 was the litheness and grace that is so
 characteristic of the monster wild cats
 her eyes moved swiftly with every
 slightest move on his part

  she was like an animal a man has
trapped watching him narrowly under-
standing something of his purpose
groping to read it all when her eyes
left him at all it was to travel in a flash
to the door to come back as swiftly he
still stood in the way he was almost
over her so that he could be upon her
before she was fairly on her feet

   now the wild rise and fall of her breasts
 had lessened a little she breathed more
 regularly with now and then a long lung-
 filling sigh she lay with one arm flung
 above her head the other at her side
 he saw the red marks of his hands
 upon her wrists and frowned

   he had been as gentle as he could
but only unmerciful strength not gen-
tleness could have quieted her he
thought how different she was from any
girl in that outside world of which she
spoke as a land of wickedness

 -	he too kept his eyes upon her her
 and the open door but he glanced
 about the room the interior of the
 cabin was just what he could have
 imagined it to be a few rough chairs
 a table some dishes a fireplace with a
 littered hearth a partition across the
 room with a bunk on each side

   he found that he -was breathing as
quickly as she was his forehead was
wet as he looked down at her rest-
ing she seemed merely a slender sun-
browned slip of a girl he marveled
at the strength in that trim little body

   i am sorry if i hurt you he said
quietly when a few moments had passed
in silence  i didnt want to hurt you

i dont want to hurt you ever wont
you believe me

  she made no answer but continued to
stare at him a hint of a frown gather-
ing her brows her eyes dark with dis-
trust from the depths of his heart he
pitied her would it not be better if
he turned now and went out of the
hcuse leaving her if he went his way
back over the mountains and into the
 outside world carrying not even the
tale to tell of her mad born of a mad
father what hope lay in life for her

   little paula he said gently sooth-
ingly as he might have spoken to a very
little girl  i am sorry for you very
sorry little paula i want to be your
friend cant you believe me

  troubled eyes eyes filled with dis-
trust and fear and emotions which
blended and were too vague for him to
grasp answered him silently he moved
a step her eyes full of eagerness
turned to the open door

   no he said steadily  you cant
go yet pretty soon i am going to let
you go you and your father and i
will go away and not even tell that you
are here he is your father isnt he

   yes she said dully

   all i want now went on sheldon
his voice as gentle as he could make it

 is for you to rest and stay with me
until your father comes back

   he will never come back while you
are here she said listlessly  never

   hell be away a deuced long long
time then he assured her grimly  ill
stay all year if i have to what makes
you think he wont come back if i am
here

   i know she answered decidedly

  she stopped there he questioned -
her still further but she was defiantly
silent so he drew a chair up and sat
down his rifle across his knees she
watched him curiously losing not so
much as his slightest gesture
the fire flower



   perplexed he brought out his pipe
 scarcely conscious that he did so it
 was his way to smoke at times of un-
 certainty when he sought to find a way
 out he swept a match across his
 thigh set it to the bowl of his pipe
 drew at it deeply and sent out a great
 cloud of smoke

    you are a devil she screamed  a
 devil 

   she had leaped to her feet seeking to
 stoop under his arms as he sprang in
 front of her wildly endeavoring to
 escape through the open door but he
 caught her and carried her back to the
 bunk she fought as she had fought
 before striking at him scratching even
 trying to sink her teeth into his forearm

   im not the one who is the devil
 he panted as at last he had thrust her
 back and stood over her again

   his pipe had fallen to the floor he
 saw that her eyes were upon it now in-
 stead of on him and the look in them
 was one of pure terror she was afraid
 of a mans pipe

   suddenly he understood and his abrupt
 laughter startling her whipped her
 piercing look back to him she drew
 away from him crouching against the
 wall ready to strike if he drew closer or
 to leap again toward the liberty he de-
 nied her and sheldon even while he
 pitied-her laughed he could not help it

   but in a little heartily ashamed of
 himself and yet grinning over his words
 he said to her

    you poor little thing that isnt any
 infernal apparatus its just a pipe and
 the stuff in it isnt brimstone but merely
 virginia tobacco everybody smokes
 outside-that is pretty nearly all the
 men do he added hastily  but i
 shouldnt have smoked without asking
 your consent in the first place and i
 shouldnt inflict that old pipe on any
 one if he did consent but honestly
 paula theres nothing satanic about it

   liar she flung at him in scornful
 disbelief

   he picked up the pipe knocked out

the fire and stuffed it back into his
pocket

   look here he said quietly his good-
natured grin still in evidence at the cor-
ners of his mouth and in his eyes  youve
just made up your mind to hate me and
call me names it isnt fair give me a
chance why dont you im not half as
bad as youre trying to make me out

  she looked her disbelief offering no re-
mark she made no pretenses she hated
him held him in high scorn would have
struck him down had she been able
would dodge out of the door- and slip
away into the forest if he gave her the
chance

  but sane or mad there was one char-
acteristic which she had in common with
all other human beings even through
her fear and distrust of him always had
her curiosity looked out nakedly he
sought to take advantage of this to make
her listen to him then to draw her out a
little so speaking slowly and quietly
he began to tell her of his trip in of
having lost his trail of many trifling in-
cidents of the journey

  then he spoke of belle fortune of men
and women there of the sort of lives they
led and of the world beyond belle for-
tune the world  outside of seattle
and san francisco of the ships and ferry-
boats of stores and theaters of public
gatherings dances picnics of how wo-
men dressed and how men gambled-a
thousand little colored bits of life with
which he wished to interest her

   men are not bad out there he as-
sured her  some are of course but
most of them are not they help one
another often enough they are friends
and pardners and a pretty good sort

  he talked with her thusly for an hour
through it she sat very still her back
against the wall her knees drawn up be-
tween her clasped hands her eyes steady
upon his what emotions if any he
stirred in her breast he could not guess
her expression altered very little-never
to show what she thought of him

  he felt rather hopeless ready to give

over in despair when out of her calm and
apparently unconcerned uninterested
quiet came the first swift unexpected
question he was speaking carelessly of
some friends in vancouver with whom he
had visited-the grahams who had the
bulliest little team of twins you ever
saw-

   tell me about them she interrupted
eagerly

  sheldon in his surprise at hearing her
speak at all lost the thread of his story

   the grahams he  asked  why
they- 

   no the babies she said  i have
never seen a baby just little baby bears
and squirrels

  she stopped as abruptly as she had
begun her lips tight shut but sheldon
had gropingly understood a wee bit of
what lay in the girls heart and hurried
to answer pretending not to see her re-
turn to her stubborn taciturnity

   well he told her pleased so that
his good-humored smile came back into
his eyes  theyre just the cutest little
pair of rascals you ever saw bill and
bet they call em just two years when
i saw them last walking around you
know and looking on at life as though
they knew all about it and up to most
anything they are something like young
bears come to think about it just
about as awkward falling over every-
thing and rolypoly fat as butterballs
why would you believe it-

  and so forth before he got through
he made a fairly creditable story of it
combining in the graham twins all the
baby tricks he had ever seen heard or
read of he affected not to be watching
her all the time but none the less saw
that there was at last a little sparkle of
interest in her eyes

   poor little starved heart he thought
 mad as she is she is still woman enough
to suffer for the want of little children
about her

  when he had done with the twins there
was a long silence in the cabin he had
pretty well talked himself out in the first

place and in the second he wanted time
to think he couldnt sit here and babble
on this way indefinitely soon or late he
must seek actively rather than thus pas-
sively for the solution to his problem

  leaning back in his chair his hands
clasped behind his head he smiled at her
pleasantly and he fancied that she was
puzzled by him that almost she was
ready to wonder if all men were in truth
the creatures of evil she so evidently had
thought them was she almost ready to
believe in him a little bit

   swallow some more fire said paula
suddenly

   eh muttered sheldon

   yes she told him  i wont run
this time

  his lips twitching he drew out his pipe
and again lighted it he saw that she
was tremendously interested the
scratching of the match made her draw
back as though from a threatened blow
but she caught herself and did not move
again he drew in a great mouthful of
smoke and sent it out ceilingward she
watched that too interestedly

  you see he informed her with a
semblance of gravity as deep as her own
 i dont swallow the fire i just take m
the smoke and-send it out again

   why do you do it she wanted to
know  is it some sort of magic
bless you no he chuckled its
just for fun a kind of habit you know
a man smokes just as youd eat ice-
cream or candy or something that was
fun to eat just as- by glory he
caught himself up  ill bet you dont
know what candy is do you

  she shook her head

   those little fire-sticks she kept
him to the subject which now held her
interest  they are magic though

  he tossed a match to her

   light it he said  you can do it
you poor little kid

  but she drew away from it shaking her
head violently and taking a chance
that he read her character in one par-
ticular he called her  coward
the fire flower



  she flashed a look at him that was full
of angry defiance and reaching out quick-
ly took up the match he saw that her
hand shook but her determination did
not she scratched the match upon the
wall held it while it burned and her
eyes while the embers fell to her lap
were dancing with excitement

  another she cried like a child in
evident forgetfulness of her hostility
 another

  she lighted them one after the other
over the second she laughed delightedly
it was the first time he had heard her
laugh he laughed with her as delighted
as she she struck a full dozen before he
stopped her saying that matches were
gold-precious on the trail and must be
hoarded

  then let me swallow smoke she
commanded

  the vision of this splendid young girl-
animal smoking his black old pipe tickled
his sense of humor and it was difficult
for him to explain seriously what in most
likelihood would be the result to her

   youve missed a lot of fun little
paula he told her through the cloud of
smoke which seemed of far greater in-
terest to her than were his words if
youve actually lived here all your life as
im beginning to believe you have never
saw a man smoke never tasted ice-
cream or candy never saw a two-year-
old baby toddling around from one mis-
hap to another never saw a street-car
or a boat or a man who had had a shave
by golly growing enthusiastic over it
 never ate a strawberry shortcake or had
a cup of coffee whew

  he put his hand into his pockct he
had seized his lunch from his pack hur-
riedly and at random in his haste he
had thought to pick out a can of beans
and one of corn he had eaten the beans
and had found that he had not brought
the corn but the one tin of peaches
which he had brought with him from
belle fortune

  such things as peaches were luxuries
but sheldon had known aforetime the

hunger for sweets which will come to a
man when hes deep in the woods he
opened his knife and under paulas bright
eyes cut out a great circle in the tin top
he speared a half of a golden - yellow
peach and tasted it to reassure her then
he gave her the can

   taste that he offered

  paula tasted a bit anxiously taking
out the peach with her finger-tips there
came into her expression something of
utter surprise then delight little short of
ecstasy and then-he marveled how
daintily such an act could be performed
-she licked the sirup from her fingers

   good he chuckled

  paula smiled at him

  smiled the red lips parted prettily
the white teeth showed for a flashing in-
stant the smile warmed him went
dancing through his blood it was a quick
smile quickly gone the white teeth were
busy with the second peach

   they were nice said paula she
had finished and turned to him with a
great sigh of satisfaction sheldons
peaches were gone

   ive got a slab of sweetened choco-
late in my pack he told her trying not
to look surprised at the empty tin  ill
bring it to you its like candy

   you are nice too said paula  are
all bad men nice

  again sheldon plunged into a long ar-
gument meant to convince her that he
wasnt a bad man at all he rather over-
did it in fact so that had paula believed
all he told her she must have thought
him an angel but paula didnt believe

   you tell me too many lies she said
quietly when he had done

  he protested and went over th ground
again but in one thing he was greatly
pleased at last she talked with him he
felt that at least some little gain had been
made and he hoped that in spite of her
words she held him in less horror than
she had at first

  once more he sought to draw her out
to get her to talk of herself of her life
of her father


all-story weekly

  have you really lived here all your
 life he asked casually

  yes she answered

  and you know absolutely nothing of
 the world outside

  i know that all men there are bad
 that they kill and steal and lie

  how do you know this

  my father has told me

 what does he know about it

  he knows everything he is very
 wise and once he lived there men
 were so wicked that he left them and
 came away to live here he brought me
 with him once she informed him
 gravely  i was a little baby like the
 twins i grew up big you know 

  not so dreadfully big he protested
  and you live here year in and year
 out

 she nodded

  but the winters there must be a
 deuced lot of snow how do you man-
 age

  there is not too damn much snow in
 here she informed him  the moun-
 tains all around are so high they stop
 much of it

  young ladies in the world outside
 he remarked soberly though with a twin-
 kle in his eyes  dont say  damn 

  dont they asked paula  why
  they call it a bad word he ex-
 plained  maybe it is you in here who
 are bad-

  papa says damn she insisted  he
 is not bad he is good

  well let it go then dont other
 men ever come here

  not many they never come to
 johnnys luck

  why

  papa kills them

 good lord the coolness of her
 statement the careless tone shocked him

  we see their camp-fire smoke some-
 times a long way off

  thats the way you came upon me
 first on the other side of the mountain
 she nodded

  how was it then you came out and

not your amiable father you dont-
dont do the work sometimes do you

   no i dont like to kill things

   and your father rather enjoys it

   n-no she hesitated  but he
must for they are bad and would hurt
us and take away-

   take away what demanded shel-
don sharply

  but she shut her lips tight and the
suspicion came back into her eyes

    oh well he said hastily  it doesnt
matter only you can rest assured that i
didnt come to take anything away un
less lightly though with deep earnest-
ness under the tone  you will let me take
you and your father back with me

  the look of suspicion changed to sud-
den terror

  no no she cried we wont
go-

   youd see other women and theyd
be good to you he went on gently
 youd see their babies and youd love
them youd have girls of your own age
to talk with youve got to believe me
paula the world isnt filled with wicked
people thats all a mistake

  he thought that she wanted to believe
him she looked for one brief instant
hungry to believe he pressed the point
but in the end she shook her head

   papa has told me she said when he
had done  papa knows

  the picture of that gaunt wild-eyed
terribly uncouth man with brain on fire
with madness was very clear m his mind
and how she trusted in him how she be-
lieved in his wisdom to sheldon here
was the most piteous case of his expe-
rience he wondered if the whole affair
would end in his taking the girl in his
arms by sheer brute strength and so
carrying her out of this cursed place or
after all would it be better better for
her if he went away and left them

   i dont know what to do he mut-
tered speaking his thought

   a little sound at the door startled him
he turned swiftly his hands tightening
about his rifle
the fire flower



  a squirrel squatted on its haunches on
the door-step its bright round eyes fixed
on him in unwinking steadiness with
quick flirt of bushy tail a second squirrel
appeared from without he leaped by
his brother landed fairly inside saw
sheldon and turned chattering and
went scampering out from the yard he
too looked in curiously there came the
third drawing near cautiously until he
too sat up on the door-step

  paula called to themsoftly so softly
that sheldon at her side barely heard
the call it came from low in her throat
and was strangely musical and soothing
she called again the squirrels pricked
up their ears

  at the third call one of them came
through the doorway hesitated made a
great circle around sheldon so that the
bushy tail brushed the wall and with a
quick little jump was on the bunk and
under the girls arm his brothers em-
boldened followed him from paulas
protecting arms they looked out at shel-
don with a suspicion not unlike that
which had been so much in her own eyes

  the girl cuddled them cooing to them
making those strange soft sounds deep in
her throat she looked up at sheldon
with the second of her quick smiles

   they are napoleon and richard and
johnny lee she told him brightly
 they are my little friends kiss me
napoleon 

  and napoleon obeyed

chapter ix

 bears are smarter

it was high noon sheldon needed no
glance at his watch to tell him that
he was hungry

  he went to the door which had re-
mained open all morning-left so in hope
of the return of the mad man-and
closed it paulas eyes followed him in-
tently he made the door fast by put-
ting its bar across it a bit of wood
from a pile of faggots by the fireplace he

forced down tight between the bar and
the door jamming it so that if the girl
sought to jerk it loose it would take time
he treated the bar of the front door sim-
ilarly

  the clip of cartridges he slipped out
of his rifle dropping it into his pocket
he had thrown no cartridge into the bar-
rel then he put the gun down turned
again toward paula and said smilingly
 turn about is fair play i gave you
a can of peaches suppose that you treat
me to the lunch

  an instant ago she had been teasing
napoleon and showing no hint of distress
suddenly now her lips were quivering
for the first time he saw the tears start
into her eyes

  wont you go away she asked
pleadingly  please please go away

   why he said in astonishment
 what is the matter dont you want to
give me something to eat	

   oh she cried even her voice shak-
ing  ill give you anything if youll only
go away you are bad bad to keep me
here like this to drive papa away-

   i didnt drive him away i dont
want him away i am waiting for him
to come back thats all i am waiting
for

   but he wont while you are here
he wont come back and out there he
will die

  die muttered sheldon whats
the matter with him

  slowly the tears welled up and spilled
over running unchecked down her cheeks
sheldon little used to women shifted un-
easily not knowing what to do feeling
that he should do something napoleon
wiser in matters of this sort made his
way to her shoulder and rubbed his soft
body sympathetically against her cheek

   open the door begged paula  be
good to me and open the door let me
go to him

   you would not know where to find
him he protested

   oh yes i would i would go to him
running


all-story weekly

   he is sick he asked

  other tears followed the first unno-
ticed by the girl sheldon thought of the
graham twins they cried that way some
time only more noisily they kept their
eyes open wide and looked at you and
the tears came until you wondered where
they all came from

   two times she said her voice trem-
bling i have thought he was dead
she shuddered  i have seen dead
things oh it is terrible this morning
i thought he was dead he did not an-
swer when i talked with him and he
lay still i could not feel him breathe i
ran out i was frightened i cried out
aloud you heard me and ran to kill me
and i ran here and he was not dead
oh i was glad but if you do not let
me go to him now-he will die-i know
he will die and i will be all alone-and
it gets so still sometimes that i cant
breathe please let me go please be
good to me

  she came to him hurriedly napoleon
sprang down and chattered in a corner
she caught up sheldons hand and held
it her eyes lifted to his pleadingly

   dont be bad to me she murmured
over and over  be good to me and let
me go to him

  when bill and bet came to him this
way he knew what to do with them he
picked them up an arm about each one
and carried them about adventuring un-
til their mama expostulated and sur-
reptitiously now and then when no one
was looking he kissed their red little
moist mouths

   please said paula  i shall not
call you bad any more i shall say you
are good and love you please

   hang it muttered john sheldon

   please  said paula

   you see-

  please said paula she laid her
wet cheek against his hand  please

   now look here young lady he told
her flattering himself that he had achieved
a remarkable dignity and looking more
awkward than john sheldon had ever

looked before  ih compromise with
you you say you know where he is
all right sit down and well eat you
and i you will then show me the way
and well go and find him and bring him
back here i havent hurt you have i
i wont hurt him no as her lips shaped
to another please im not going to
let you go alone we go together-or we
stay right here which is it

  paula frowned then she wiped away
the tears whether some deep feminine
instinct had told her that they had almost
served their purpose but were useless
now will perhaps never be known she
went across the room to a rude cupboard
and brought from it a blackened pot con-
taining a meat stew sheldon was hun-
gry enough to dispense with the stew
being warmed up merely to make con-
versation to divert her thoughts from her
fathers danger he said carelessly

   you must have trouble getting your
meat you cant have much ammuni-
tion he tasted the stew and found it
although salt was noticeably wanted sa-
vory and palatable  what sort of meat
is it he asked

   snakes  said paula

  sheldon had swallowed just before put-
ting the last question paula was given
the joy of seeing his tanned cheeks pale
a little a look of horror came into his
eyes then he caught an expression of
lively malice in hers malice and mirth
commingled

   snakes and lizards said paula  we
catch em in holes-

  you little devil muttered the man
under his breath and to show her that
he knew now that she was making fun of
him he went back to his stew  just the
same miss paula he told her threaten-
ingly  if we ever do get to the outside
ill take you to dinner some time and
ill order oysters and shrimps for you
and crab and lobster by glory i won-
der what youll say at that

  paula didnt know didnt have any
opinion on the subject

   they are fishes she hazarded the
the fire flower



opinion with an uncertain show at cer-
tainty  we eat fishes too

  he ate his scanty meal insisting upon
her coming to sit across the table from
him she watched him but refused to
eat plainly she was still deeply dis-
tressed her eyes were never still going
from him to the door to the rifle on the
floor by him to the door again but she
made no further attempt at escape

  meanwhile he took this opportunity to
examine the cabin more carefully than he
had done so far a broken bottle stood
in a corner serving as a vase for a hand-
ful of field flowers upon the walls were
a number of pictures gleaned years ago
from newspapers-one a view of the busi-
ness section of a city one a seascape one
a lady in a ball dress of about i or
 one a couple of kittens

  upon the wall on paulas side of the
partition was a bulge which was evident-
ly the young womans wardrobe covered
over with a blanket hung from pegs an
ax with a crude handle lay on the floor
a long heavy box served both as re-
ceptacle for odds and ends and covered
with a plank as a bench

   now said sheldon  shall we go
and find your father

  paula did not hesitate nor did she
again seek to-dissuade him from his pur-
pose

   yes she said

  he went to the rear door and opened

it

   you must understand he told her
standing in the way so that she could not
pass him his rifle in his right hand his
left extended to her  that i am not
going to take any chances of losing you
too you can run faster than i can and
i dont want you to prove it again you
must give me your hand

  for an instant she drew away from
him the old distrustful look coming back

   i would like to kill you she said
in a way which made him believe that she
meant what she said then she came
to him and slipped her hand into his

  so they went out into the sunlight side

by side sheldons hand gripping paulas
tightly

   which way he asked

   this way she nodded toward the
forest closing in about them at the east
that way the madman had gone she
seemed to feel no uncertainty but walked
on briskly holding as far away from him
as she could manage so that her arm
stretched out almost horizontally from her
shoulder

  so they went on for a hundred yards
or so through the great trees that stood
like living columns all about them every
nerve tense sheldon sought to watch her
trusting her as little as she him and at
the same time keep a lookout for her
father

  one thing he had missed from the cabin
which he had expected to find there if
the madman had killed thos wanderers
who incurred his kingly displeasure by
venturing into his realm then he must
have taken their guns with their other
belongings

  there had been no rifle leaning against
the wall no pistol to be seen what had
become of them certainly no adventu-
ring prospector had ever come in here
without at the least his side-arms it
was quite possible that the madman kept
them secreted somewhere in the forest
that he had run for a rifle that even now
he was crouching behind a clump of
bushes his burning eyes peering over the
sights

  at every little sound sheldon turned
this way or that sharply there was so
little calculating what a madman would
do but he must take his chances if he
did not mean to turn tail and run out of
the whole affair and he told himself
that it had been perhaps a matter of
years since a stranger had brought fresh
ammunition here that the madman
would have long ago exhausted his supply
hunting

  they went in silence paulas eyes
showed a great preoccupation sheldon
had little enough mind for talk as the
forest grew denser about them and the


all-story weekly

undergrowth thickened they came into
a narrow path well trodden now paula
despite her evident distaste was forced
to walk close at his side sometimes slip-
ping a little behind him he judged that
they had gone a full mile before they
came to a distinct forking of the trails

   we go this way said paula indi-
cating the trail leading off toward the
right

  they turned as she directed sheldon
felt a tremor run through the girls arm
and looked at her inquiringly but the
emotion however inspired had passed
she came on her hand lying relaxed in
his walking close at his side passive

  presently she said

   we must watch for him now we
are near the place

  on either hand were many small trees
here and there a fallen log everywhere
small shrubs which he did not recognize
thick with bright red berries he watched
paula watched even more for the mad-
man they came into a cleared space as
wide as an ordinary room

   look yonder  cried the girl sharply

  she had thrown up her left hand point-
ing across his breast he looked swiftly

  in an instant she was no longer pas-
sive with all of that supple strength
which he knew to lie in that beautiful
body of hers she had thrown herself
against him pushing at him his weight
was greater so much greater than hers
that though taken unaware he was barely
budged two paces

  but that was ample for the purpose of
paula he heard a sharp crackling of
dead branches and leaves the ground
gave way under his feet and crashing
through a flimsy covering of slender limbs
and twigs he plunged downward falling
sheer

  he threw out his arm to save himself
his rifle was flung several feet away pau-
la had jerked free and with the breath
jolted out of his body he lay upon his
back in a pit ten feet deep struggling to
free himself of the branches which he
had brought with him in his fall

  at last he stood up he had strained
an ankle in striking he did not know for
the moment whether or not he had broken
his left arm his hands and face were
scratched his body was sore his face
grew red to a towering rage

  standing at the brink of the pit stoop-
ing a little to look down at him was
paula he had never seen a look of
greater gladder triumph upon a human
face

   you are not very smart said paula
contemptuously  to get caught in a trap
like that bears are smarter

  john sheldon for the first time on
record swore violently in the presence of
a young woman she did not appear in
the least shocked perhaps she was ac-
customed to occasional outbursts from
her father rather she looked delighted
in fact she clapped her hands and there
came down to him to swell his rage her
tinkling laughter

   when i get out of this im going to
spank you he growled meaning every
word of it  good and hard too dont
you know you might have broken my
neck

   you are not coming out dimpled
paula  if you are very good i will feed
you every day and bring you water

 sheldon answered her with an angry
silence there is no wrath like that which
has in it something of self accusation he
might have expected something like this
turning his back on her he sought the
way out of the bear pit forthwith his
anger like a tube of quicksilver carried
out into the hot sun mounted to new
heights while he did not

  the trap was cunningly made must
have required weeks in the excavation
at the bottom it was some ten feet wide
at the opening above his head perhaps
not over eight feet thus its walls sloped
in at the- top and he promptly saw the
futility of trying to scramble out he
would have to use his sheath-knife hack
hand holds and dig places out for his feet
and at that he saw that he would have his
work cut out for him
the fire flower



  and his rifle lay on the ground above
a sudden disquieting vision was vivid-
ly outlined in his imagination suppose
that the madman came now he could
stand above and if he had nothing but
stones to hurl down- the vision ended
with a shudder as sheldon remembered
two bleached piles of bones

  crouching he leaped upward seizing
the pitts edge the soil crumbled gave
way he slipped back he heard paulas
laughter coolly taunting he crouched
leaped again furious as he found no hand
hold to try again wouldbut be to make
a fool of himself

  among the broken branches about him
he sought one strong enough to bear his
weight he stood it upright against the
wall of the pit with his knife in one
hand driven into the bank the other
hand gripping the leaning branch he
sought to climb out and then from
across the pit at his back paula called
sharply

   stop i am going to shoot

  he slipped back and turned toward
her she was on her knees his rifle in
her hands the barrel looking unnaturally
large as it described nervously erratic arcs
and ellipses but paulas eyes looking
very determined threatened him along
the sights

  with a feeling of devout thankfulness
he remembered that he had taken out the
clip of cartridges at the cabin then
with sudden sinking heart he remem-
bered also that before he opened the door
to come out he had again slipped the
clip in

  what he could not remember to save
him was whether or not he had thrown
a cartridge into the barrel

   ive got one chance out of a thou-
sand and a cursed slim chance it is h
told himself grimly  she cant miss me
at this range if she tries

  here lay his one chance  he had not
thrown a cartridge into the barrel and if
the girl knew nothing of an automatic
rifle he might have time to get out yet
before she discovered how to operate it

these two  ifs  struck him at that mo-
ment as the tallest pair of ifs he had ever
met

  he racked his brains for the answer to
that one question  did i throw a load
into the barrel one moment he was
certain that he remembered doing so the
next he was as certain that he had not
he was very uncomfortable

  ive got to shoot you paula was
crying  i dont want to oh i dont
want to shoot you but you would kill
us you would kill papa and-im going
to shoot 

   for gods sake shoot and get it over
with then muttered sheldon he
didnt think that he was a coward but he
knew that he was white as a ghost and
he didnt even know that the gun was
loaded

  the gun barrel wavered uncertainly
the girls finger was on the trigger that
a very slight pressure would set ofp-and
it made him faint to see how that finger
was shaking paula had one eye shut
tight the other peered wildly along the
sights one instant she was aiming at
his stomach the next at his knees

  paula shut both eyes and pulled the
trigger after a century-long second in
which there was no discharge sheldon
laughed loudly if somewhat shakily and
seeing his one chance now about to bring
him his safety he lost no more time in
inactivity but began again with knife
and dead branch to try to make his way
out

  paula sprang to her feet her cheeks
that had been pale growing suddenly
flushed and with the gun at her shoulder
pulled again and again at the trigger
sheldon managed to get half-way out
lifted his hand to grasp the brink-and
slipped back again

  then the girl crying out angrily threw
down the gun whirled and disappeared
in a flash sheldon struggled manfully
to work his way out of his pit before she
should be lost to him entirely in the
woods but when at last he was out and
had caught up his rifle the still woods

about him hid her giving no sign which
way she had gone

chapter x

the golden giant

ix the wilderness which is the sasnokee-
keewan a man seeking to escape a
pursuer need not have the slightest
difficulty this fact sheldon was forced
to admit immediately

  there were trackless forests where a
fugitive could laugh at a score of hunters
rocky slopes over which he could run
leaving no sign of his passing thickets in
which he might lie in safety while a man
who was looking for him went by so close
that one might easily toss a stone to the
other

  but for an hour sheldon sought for
paula and her father hoping that through
some fortunate chance he might stumble
upon them he returned to the forking
of the trails where the girl had directed
him to the right now he took the other
path leading toward the northeast but
in a little while it branched and branched
again and there were no tracks in the
grassy soil to help him

  he followed one trail after another al-
ways coming back when there had been
nothing to persuade him that he was not
perhaps setting his back toward those he
sought and in the end he gave over his
quest as hopeless and retraced his steps
to johnnys luck

  the back door was wide open as he had
left it he stepped inside moving cau-
tiously realizing that one or both of them
might have returned here before him but
there was no sign that either had done so
the other door was shut the bar across
it the cabins interior had been in no
way disturbed since he had been there
last

  it seemed that there was nothing that
he could do now to be sure he might
rifle their few belongings in an endeavor
to learn who they were so that if he was
forced to go back alone to the  world

outside he could see to give word of
them to any relatives they might have
but he disliked the job certainly he
would resort to no such action until it
had become evident that it was the only
thing to do he went out closed the
door after him and turned his back upon
johnnys luck for while he had the
opportunity it would be well to look to
buck and to his pack

  his horse he found browsing leisurely
in the grove where he had left him the
pack in the gulch had not been disturbed
sheldon went to it for a fresh tin of to-
bacco made into a little bundle enough
food for a couple of meals and with a
thoughtful smile he slipped his one slab
of chocolate into his pocket then hav-
ing moved buck a little deeper into the
grove he turned again toward johnnys
luck soon or late the madman or the
girl would come back to their cabin
while his patience lasted sheldon would
wait there for them

  this time when he came again into the
cabin where still there was no sign that
its owners had been there since he had
left it he closed the back door and flung
the front one wide open for if the mad-
man and the girl came back sheldon pre-
ferred to have them come this way so
that he could see them in the clearing
that had once been a street of johnnys
luck then with nothing else to do he
strode back and forth in the rough room
and smoked his pipe and stared about
him

  so it was that at last one of the pic-
tures upon the wall caught and held his
attention it was an old line-cut from a
newspaper held in place by little pegs
through the corners the man pictured
might have been fifty or he might have
been thirty the artist had achieved a
sketch of which neither he nor his subject
need be proud the thing which interest-
ed sheldon was the printed legend under
the drawing

  charles francis hamilton professor of en-
tomology in brownell university author of
 the lepidoptera of the canadian rocky
the fire flower



mountains a monogram upon the basil-
archia arthemis etc

  in ten lines was an article  of interest
to the scientific world announcing that
professor hamilton representing the in-
terests of the newly endowed college of
entomology an institution whose aims
 are the pervestigation into the rarer va-
rieties of the lepidoptera flying in the
north american altitudes over 
feet was preparing for an expedition
into the less known regions of the cana-
dian northwest

  here was matter of interest to john
sheldon that such a clipping should be
found upon the wall of a log cabin in the
sasnokee-keewan in itself set him musing
but as he stood looking at it other
thoughts more closely connected with the
matter in his mind suggested themselves
perhaps the madman had also been a sci-
entist an entomologist hence a man of
education that would explain how it
came about that paula spoke an english
which was not that of a rough miner

  but another chance discovery brought
sheldon closer to the truth the cup-
board door was open in plain sight
upon a low shelf was a thick volume
sheldon took it up it was an abstrusely
technical treatise upon butterflies by
charles francis hamilton phd and
was dedicated

 to my dear wife paula

   good lord muttered sheldon

  to be sure there might have been no
end of explanations beside the one which
presented itself to him first but here
was a tenable theory one to which he
clung rather more eagerly than he as yet
understood

 the madman was no other than
charles francis hamilton entomologist
of note about i not only had the
man not always been mad lut at one
time had a brilliant mind he had come
into the unknown parts of the great
northwest so much of which is still un-
known to-day even though men have

made roads through it and there he had
lost his sanity

   one could conceive of some terrible ill-
ness which had broken the man and
twisted his brain hideously or of an ac-
cident from which merely the physical
part of him had recuperated or of some
terrible experience such as is no stranger
in the wilderness hardship on top of
hardship starvation perhaps when a
man is lost and bewildered some shock
which would unseat the reason

  somewhere he had found paula it
migrt be as she herself said that he was
her father that he had brought her a
little girl into the mining country or
it was quite as conceivable that he had
 acquired  some little motherless fath-
erless waif no blood kin to him and had
reared her as his own daughter naming
her  paula in any case it was made
clear why she did not use the speech of
the illiterate

  and it was equally obvious that the
girl might be sane

   of course she is said sheldon dis-
gusted with himself for his perfectly nat-
ural suspicions  what girl raised in a
place like this all her life by a madman
wouldnt be a trifle-different

  and with renewed interest and impa-
tience he awaited their return mean-
while he turned the pages of the book
slowly here and there he came upon
a slip of paper yellow with the years
upon which were notes set down neatly
and in a small legible hand for the
most part these notes consisted of latin
names and abbreviations which meant
nothing to john sheldon against each
annotation there stood a date these
dates went back as far as  some
were as recent as 

    get an alienist and an entomologist
together over this thing thought shel-
don  and they could figure to the day
when hamilton went mad

  for distinctly the more recent notes
were in the same hand but not inspired
by the same brain as the earlier ones in
the latter there was the cofd precision of


all-story weekly

the scientist in the others the burning
enthusiasm of a madman

  a note in the body of the text awoke
in sheldon this train of thought under
the heading papilioninae the swallow
tail butterflies there was written in
lead pencil

  to-day i have discovered it immortal it-
self it shall make me immortal alt  ft
aug  

  sheldon turned a couple of pages
here were further notes under anew
heading sub-family parnassunae the
words were

  i was misled by the osmateria in the larva
it is a parnassian and the fools think there
are only four upon the continent i have found
the fifth but i was right about its immortal-
ity measurement about nine feet from tip to
tip it is found xxxxx its food is xxxxx ho
this is my secret alt xxxxx date xxxxx

f c h

  sheldon shook his head and sighed
to him the penciled words were strangely
pathetic so plainly was there to be seen
the working of the scientific brain which
sought to tabulate important facts in con-
nection with the new parnassian so evi-
dent the insane cunning which compro-
mised by putting down a string of crosses
to baffle him who might come upon these
notes

   there is but the one in the world and
i have found it was a foot-note and
then scattered through the volume were
such penciled jottings as

  i have named it it is parnassius aureus gi-
ganticus the wings are of gold

   giganticus flies at sunrise and at sunset

  i have set my trap at alt xxxxx this time
i shall get him

  only one in the world but-it will oviposit
in nineteen days i shall raise another one
there is but one egg

  a new peak for my trap the alt is wrong

  the only parnassius in the world whose wings
are not white but of gold whose hind-wing tail
prolongations are like papilio this is the golden
emperor of space the monarch of the infinite
master of eternity and immortality for its
diet is that elixir rising mistlike from xxxxx

oh i must not write it down not even little
paula must guess this

   flight of incredible speed i have estimated
to-day that my golden giant travels at the rate
of  mi in  sec id est  mi per hour he
might sail around the world and other eyes than
mine never see him this is why he has re-
mained throughout the centuries for me to dis-
cover	f c h

   another fool from the world outside has tried
to steal my secret from me i killed him

  i am midas king of gold he is parnassius
aureus giganticus great golden monarch of
space we are immortals

  sheldon stared out through the open
door his gaze going over the dead for-
gotten town and to the little lake lying
languid in the sunshine for the instant
he forgot charles francis hamilton and
his thoughts were all for paula

  a girl reared in the solitude taught the
weird wild fancies of a madman accept-
ing insanity for infallible wisdom how
should a man deal with such as she must
be if midas died-then what

   would she go with me back to the
world he wondered  or is the rest of
her life to be that of a wild hunted
thing even if i can find her which is
extremely doubtful can i convince her
that the strongest beliefs of her whole
life are wrong

  in truth he found that his perplexities
were but growing but with his jaw set
he vowed to himself that if he did find
her hed take her out with him if he had
to bind her with a rope like the wild
thing she was suddenly there came to
him through the stillness a long-drawn
cry of pure terror it came from far off
back of the cabin toward the mountain-
side

  rifle in hand sheldon ran out of the
house and plunged into the forest

chapter xi

the golden emperors flight

the hope which stood high in john
sheldons breast was short lived
there was that one cry undoubted-
ly paulas then only the silence broken
the fire flower



by sheldons crashing through the bushes
now and then when he stopped to listen
he heard only his own heavy breathing

  but he pushed on deeper into the
woods her voice had floated to him
clearly she could not be very far away
and he knew the general direction but
when he came at last to the foot of the
mountain where there were long lines of
low cliffs he had found nothing and
although he did not give up as the hours
passed and the sun turned toward the
west his search went unrewarded

  he went back and forth along the base
of the cliffs fearing that she had fallen
that that scream had been whipped from
her as she plunged over a precipice he
breathed more easily when he could be as-
sured that this was not the case after
a while he even called out to her crying
 paula where are you i wont hurt
you but there was no answer

  why had she cried out like that one
suspicion came early and naturally per-
haps to draw him away from the cabin so
that she or the madman could slip back
to it he had retraced his steps when the
thought came to him running but as
before there was no sign that another
than himself had recently visited the
house

  late in the afternoon great black thun-
der clouds began to gather upon the
mountain tops they billowed up with
the wind-driven swiftness of a summer
storm piling higher and higher until the
sky was blotted out	y

  a peal of thunder another-deep rum-
bles reverberating threateningly a drop
of rain splashed against his hand he
could hear the big drops pelting through
the leaves of the trees scattering drops
kicked up little puffs of dust in dry bare
spaces a forked tongue of lightning
thrust into the bowels of the thick massed
clouds seemed to rip them open the
rain came down in a mighty downpour
the rumble of the thunder was like the
ominous growl of ten thousand hungering
beasts

  the lightning stabbed again and again

the skies bellowed mightily the forest
shivered and moaned like a frightened
thing under the hissing impact of the sud-
den wind the dry ground drank the
water thirstily but even so little rivulets
and pools began to form everywhere the
rain like a thick veil blown about by the
wind hid the mountains or gave brief
views of them for fifteen minutes the
storm filled sky and forest noisily then
it passed after the way of summer show-
ers and sheldon came out from the
makeshift shelter of a densely foliaged
tree

  he was a mile or more from johnny
luck the storm over he turned back
on his trail again determined to gain the
cabin before the daylight was gone to
wait there again for those for whom it was
futile to search then the second time
unexpectedly he heard paulas voice
calling

   where are you it cried  oh
where are you

  he stepped out of the trail slipping be-
hind a giant pine she could not be a
hundred yards away he thought that she
was coming on toward him that she was
running

  the world was filled with a strange
light from the lowering sun shining
through the wet air alight which shone
warmly like gold which seemed to throb
and quiver and thrill as it lay over the
forest it gave to grass and tree a new
vivid green a yellow flower looked like a
burning flame out of a fringe of trees
into a wide open space pauta came

  she came on running with her own in-
imitable graceful swiftness until she was
not a score of paces from him here she
stopped abruptly looking this way and
that eagerly listening sheldon his heart
hammering from his own eagerness stood
still if she came a little nearer-

   where are you she called again
 man from the world outside where are
you

  sheldon stared in amazement she was
calling him she was seeking him running
to him


all-story weekly

  before he could answer her quick eyes
had found him out with a strange look
in them which he could not fathom she
ran to him she was in the grip of some
emotion so strong that she was no longer
afraid of him so that she laid her hand
for the fraction of a second upon his arm
as she cried brokenly

  come come quickly

   what is it he demanded wondering
 what do you want what is the mat-
ter

   you must help him she answered
swiftly  he says to bring you but
you must hurry run

  again she had touched him was tug-
ging at his sleeve he looked at her curi-
ously even suspiciously not unmindful of
the bear-pit of this morning but her eyes
were wide with alarm not inspired by him
alarm too sincere to be mistrusted since
all things are possible it might be that
the madman had sent her to lure sheldon
into some further danger but there was
only one way to know

   go on he said crisply  im with
you

  she turned then and sped back the way
she had come sheldon running at her
heels she turning her head now and then
accommodating her pace to his this way
and that they wove their way through the
forest in a little they were again under
the cliffs standing upon the eastern rim
of the valley in the open now he car-
ried his rifle in two hands ready

  but here at least was no trap set for
him paula running on ahead of him
now suddenly had dropped to her knees
and for the first time sheldon saw the
prone body of the madman the girl had
taken his head into her lap and was bend-
ing over him the gaunt hollow burning
eyes blazed full at sheldon and they
were filled with malice with lurking cun-
ning with suspicion and unutterable
hatred but the man made no effort to
rise sheldon came on until he stood over
him

   he fell from the cliffs he asked
looking down for a second into the eyes of

paula which filled with anguish were
turned up to him

  she sought to answer but her voice
broke she choked up and  could only
shake her head he looked away from
her to the head resting in her lap there
was reason enough for the dread in paulas
breast the man was dying

   tell me said sheldon softly  can
i do anything for you is there any way
i can help you

  the burning eyes narrowed the old
man lifted a shaking hand and pushed the
tangled beard away from his lips

  curse you he panted why are
you here

   why father cried paula you
told me to bring him

   him it was a mutter deep in the
throat labored and harsh  you were to
get a dotor girl this man is a thief like
the others he comes to steal our fortune
from us

  both bewilderment and terror stared out
of the girls eyes her hand on the old
mans brow drew the matted hair back
smoothed and smoothed the hot skin

  fully realizing the futility of seeking to
reason with unreason nevertheless sheldon
said gently  i didnt come to steal any-
thing i was just loafing through the
country got lost and came here

  liar scoffed the other i know
what you want but you cant have it
it is my secret 

   but father pleaded paula her lips
trembling  why did you send me for him
if he-

   mr hamilton began sheldon

  the old man frowned

   hamilton he muttered  who is
hamilton where is hamilton

   you are said sheldon stoutly
 dont you remember charles francis
hamilton professor of entomology in
brownell university

   brownell university there came
a thoughtful pause yes of course i
am charles francis hamilton phd
md professor of entomology who
said that i wasnt
the fire flower

m

    then dr hamilton yon ought to be
able to tell by looking at me and sheldon
grinned reassuringly  that i am no
scientist i dont know the difference be-
twen a bug and an insect i swear i dont
im just a mining engineer out of a job
and down on the rocks

    then querulously  you didnt come
looking for-

    for the parnassius aureus giganti-
cus smiled sheldon  no and though
you may not believe it i dont come look-
ing for gold either	

   his words had a strange unlooked-for
effect  he had hoped that they might a
little dispel suspicion instead the mad-
man jerked away from paulas hands
sought to spring to his feet and achieved
a position half-kneeling half-squatting
his whole body shaken a wild fury in his
eyes

   my parnassius he shrieked my
parnassius he comes to steal it away
from me it and my immortality with it
curse him and curse him and curse him
he knows he has stolen my secret he
says  parnassius aureus giganticus he
knows its name the name i have given it
he says  gold  he knows that the
parnassius is to be found only where the
mother lode of the world is bared that
there is a little invisible mist a vapory
elixir which rises from gold in the sun
and that my parnassius lives upon it
drinks it in and that that is why it is im-
mortal he knows curse him he knows
he knows

 he was raging wildly his words came
in a tumbled fury of sound like the fall of
waters down a rocky cliff his body grew
tense to the last muscle and then shook
again as with an ague paula upon her
feet now her hands clasped in a mute
agony of suspense turned frightened eyes
from him to sheldon

  slowly the wreck that was charles
francis hamilton one time man of scien-
tific note straightened up the tall gaunt
form swaying dangerously stood erect
a terribly attenuated arm was flung up
then the forearm drawn across the brow

   as though with the motion which pushed
back the streaming white hair he would
clear the burning brain too

  then just as sheldon was prepared for
a mad attack of the pitifully broken
figure the pale lips parted to a cry such
as he had never in all his life heard it
was a cry of pure triumph the voice was
wonderfully clear now and went ringing
through the silence like a bells tinkling
notes the eyes too were clear bright
as before but now triumphant like the
voice untroubled filled with the sheer
ecstasy of perfect gladness

   look cried the madman  it is
the golden emperor of infinity look
he is coming-to me

  erect he no longer swayed the long
right arm thrown out pointed toward the
western sky and was rigid unshaken for
the - moment the figure was dominant
masterful the gesture demanded and re-
ceived obedience in his final moment
charles francis hamilton stood clothed
in conscious power unshaken in a great
faith-triumphant there was no other
word for him then

   look cried the madman

  but was he mad

  for both paula and john sheldon
turned and looked-and saw what the old
man saw there in the strange weird
light in the west clear against the sky
were a great pair of wings flashing like
pure beaten gold as a graceful speeding
body described a long sweeping curve
seemed for a moment to be dropping below
the mountain-tops then rose climbing
higher and higher

  higher and higher-until it was gone
until as the wide wings trembled in the
vault of the clearing heavens john shel-
don saw that they were no longer beaten
gold but just the feathered wings of a
great eagle metamorphosed for an instant
by a trick of sun

but it was gone gone with it the sod
of a madman without a cry his old lips
forming into a smile indescribably sweet
his eyes still bright with victory he
stooped stooped farther his legs weakened


all-story weekly

under him he settled down rested a mo-
ment fell backward his golden em-
peror of the infinite had borne away upon
its golden wings the soul which craved and
now won-immortality

  he is dead said paula lifelessly
 he is dead

  more moved than he had thought to be
sheldon knelt by the quiet body the
fretful pulse was still the tired heart was
at rest the fever-ridden brain slept

   yes he said quietly as kneeling he
removed his hat and looked up pityingly
into paulas set face  he is dead poor
little paula

  she stared at him with her eyes widen-
ing in eloquent expression of the new emo-
tions in her breast she stood very still
her hands clasped as they had been when
the old man rose to his feet her brown
fingers were slowly going white from their
own steady pressure sheldon could only
wonder gropingly what this tragedy would
mean to her other girls had lost fathers
before now but when had a girl lost
every one she knew in the world as paula
had lost now

  there was nothing for sheldon to say
so he remained a little kneeling his head
bowed in spontaneous reverence waiting
for the burst of tears from her which
would slacken the tense nerves but it
did not come presently paula drew
nearer knelt like sheldon put her two
warm hands upon the cold forehead
sheldon saw a shiver run through her
she drew back with a sharp cry

  dead she whispered dead

   poor little paula he said again in
his heart aloud he said nothing

  after a while he got to his feet and
went away from her dabbing at his own
eyes as he went grumbling under his
breath he wanted to take her into his
arms-as he did the twins bill and bet-
to hold her close and let her cry and pat
her shoulder and say there there
there was much of kindness and gentle-
ness and sympathy under the rough out-
side shell of john sheldon and it went out

  unstintedly to a slip of a girl who was
alone as no other girl in all the world

  when he came back she was sitting very
still her hand patting softly one of the
cold lifeless hands she looked up curi-
ously speaking in a quiet whisper

   he will never wake up

   not in this world answered sheldon
gently  but maybe the soul of him is
already awake in another world

   where the golden t tterfly went
whispered paula

   you saw it

   yes with beautiful wings all of gold
father knew it was like that has his
soul gone away with it up and up and
beyond the clouds and through the sky
and to the other world

  and john sheldon answered simply
saying

   yes my dear

  paula was very still again her eyes
thoughtful

   what will we do with-him she
asked after a long silence the first hint of
tears in her eyes

  then he told her explaining as he
would to bill and bet as one talks with a
credulous child hiding those things upon
which man is so prone to look as horrible
showing as best he knew that there is
beauty in death he spoke softly very
gently with her and her eyes lifted to
him might have been those of little bet

   you will get flowers for him he said
at the end  hundreds and hundreds of
flowers you will put them all about him
we will make him a pretty soft bed of
them we will cover him with them and
every year in the spring other flowers
will grow here and blossom and drop their
leaves on his place and-and little
paula maybe he will be watching you and
smiling at you and happy-

  it spite of him his voice grew hoarse
paula sat now with her face hidden in her
crossed arms he could see a tear splash
to her knee

  when the sun rose after the long night
it shone upon a great mound of field
the fire flower



 flowers hiding a lesser mound of newly
 turned earth and upon a golden-brown
 maiden lying face down in the grass sob-
 bing-and upon a new john sheldon

    for into his life had come one of those
 responsibilities which make men over and
 together with the responsibility a tumult
 of emotions bom no longer ago than the
 dewdrops which the morning had hung
 upon the grass

chapter xii

golden emperors bait

 during that tragic day sheldon
 never lost sight of the bewildered
 girl-she seemed just breathless
 and stunned rather than grief-stricken-
 for more than half an hour at a time he
 watched over her while seeming to be
  busy rifle cleaning or fishing for a trout
 for luncheon now and then he spoke
 just a little homely word of no importance
 other than the assurance to her that she
 was not utterly alone not once did she
 return an answer or offer a remark

    in the late afternoon she brought great
 armfuls of fresh flowers heaping them
 upon the wilted ones as night came on
 she stood looking wistfully at them for a
 loaig time then she turned and walking
 swiftly went back to johnnys luck
 john sheldon went with her

    they had their supper together sitting
 opposite each other at the crude table
 paula ate little nibbiing absent-mindedly
 at the slab of chocolate pushing the fish
 aside untasted drinking the water set be-
 fore her sheldon made coffee and she
 watched him curiously as he drank the
 black beverage but she did not taste it

     look here paula he said when the
 silence had lasted on until after he had got
 his pipe going  weve got some big ques-
 tions ahead of us to answer and we cant
 begin too soon now after all death comes
 to us all soon or late it came to your
 fathers father and mother it has come
 to mine it will come to you and me some
 day while we live weve got to be doing

something youve got to decide what
you are going to do i am going out of
here in a few days and you cant stay
here all alone

   i can she answered steadily  i
will

   come now he objected speaking
lightly  thats all wrong you know it
cant be done why in the world should
a young girl like you want to live all alone
here in the wilderness before when your
father was with you it was different
now what is there to stay for

    i shall stay said paula gravely  un-
til some day the big golden butterfly comes
and takes me away too

   how would you live he asked curi-
ously

   as i have always lived we have the
traps father and i made i could make
others i know how to catch fish i
know many plants with leaves and roots
good to eat when you cook them in water
 but what would you do all the time
 why said paula simply  i would
wait

   wait

   yes for the big butterfly

  then sheldon set himself manfully to
his task he sought to reawaken the in-
terest which she had shown when he spoke
of the world outside he spoke of the thou-
sand things she could see and do he told
her of other men and women of how they
dressed of how they spent their lives of
their aims and ambitions of their numer-
ous joys of aeroplanes and submarines
of telephones and talking machines of
music and theaters and churches but
paula only shook her head saying quietly
 i shall stay here

   and never see any children asked
sheldon  little babies like bill and bet
little roly-poly rascals with dirty faces and
bright eyes and fat chubby hands youll
miss all that

   ill stay here said paula  this is
my home

  and no further answer did he get that
night	

  as her weary body which had known

so little rest during the last two days be-
gan to droop in her chair sheldon left her
going to spend the night out in the open
in front of the cabin paula closed the
door after him saying listlessly  good
night in response to his

   you are not afraid of me any longer
are you paula he asked as he left her

   no she answered  i am not afraid
of you now you have been good to
me

  when in the morning he came to the
cabin the door stood open when he
called there was no answer when he
went in the cabin was empty

  even then he did not believe that she
had again fled from him he went hur-
riedly through the woods until he came
to the heaped-up mound of flowers fear-
ing a little hoping more that he was
going to find her here but though he
looked for her everywhere he did not
find her though he lifted his voice call-
ing loudly she did not answer

  it was a weary empty day at one
moment he cursed himself for not having
guarded against her flight at the next
he told himself that he could not always
be watching her and that there was no
reason why he should have suspected that
she was going to slip away now when
some little sound came to him through
the still forest he looked up quickly ex-
pecting to see her coming to him when
she did not come he wondered if he
would ever see this wonderfully dainty
half-wild maid again

  all day long he did not give over seek-
ing her calling her he grew to hate
the sound of his own voice bringing its
own echo alone for answer he began
to realize what her going meant he be-
gan to see that he wanted not only to
take her with him back into his own
world but that he wanted to give up that
life to showing her the world he had
told her about he wanted paula

  he tramped up and down until he cov-
ered many a mile that day he ran-
sacked his pack for anylittle articles of
food which might be new to her and

they remained upon the cabin table un-
touched

  noon came and afternoon and evening
and without paula he was lonely he who
had come far from the beaten trails to
be alone

  in the early night he builded a fire in
the cabins fireplace for the light and
companionship of it and sat staring into
the flames and smoking his pipe and all
the time listening eagerly a dozen times
he thought that he heard her light foot-
fall but she did not come

  he got up and went to the door stand-
ing long looking out into the quiet night
star-filled the moon was not yet up
the night was so still so filled with soli-
tude that he felt a sudden wonder that
a girl even a girl like paula could be
far out in it alone

  where was she lying face down in
the thick of the woods crushed with the
loneliness which had touched even him
or sitting somewhere in the starlight her
lovely face upturned her deep eyes seek-
ing to read the eternal riddles of the stars
and the night her soul grasping at vague
thoughts her mind struggling pitifully
with the problems of life and death

  all night he sat before the fire dozing
now and then but for the most part
listening waiting when morning came
he made a hurried breakfast and his
plan for the day formed during the hours
of darkness left the cabin

  he had come to the conclusion that
there must be some hiding-place some
shelter other than the cabin which paula
and her father had used to that place
no doubt the madman had fled when he
had sought to avoid sheldon thither
perhaps paula had gone last night

  it might be another cabin far out it
might be a cave in the cliffs sheldon
inclined to the latter belief at any rate
he told himself determinedly that he
would find this retreat and that in it
he would discover those belongings of
the men hamilton had killed their
knives and rifles their boots perhaps
and he hoped to find paula
the fire flower



  he went straightway to the cliffs near
which dr hamilton had died they
stretched a mile or more to both north
and south sheldon admitted to himself
at the beginning that he had his work
cut out ahead of him thorough search
here for the mouth of a possible cave
might consume weeks but all the time
in the world was his he set about his
task methodically

  all day he climbed in and out among
the boulders and spires of rock at night
he had found nothing he returned to
the cabin and throwing himself upon the
bunk which had once been dr hamil-
tons slept soundly

  in the morning he went out again be-
ginning his search where yesterdays had
ended that day passed like the other
ended as it had done in the forenoon
he killed a young buck that had come
down to the creek to drink skinned it
and hung the meat upon the limb of a
tree to dry building a smudge under it

   if i have to stay here until snow
flies muttered sheldon  well then ill
stay

  a week passed during it he had had
no sign that paula existed-no hint of
the theoretical  hiding-place  which he
sought but each day he spent long
hours in the quest striving from the first
glow of dawn to the coming of dusk he
had searched out every spot of the cliffs
to the south climbing high up looking
everywhere now in the same system-
atic way he turned toward the north
and upon the second day of the second
week he came upon part of that which
he sought-that and something else

  upon a broad ledge a score of feet from
the ground hard to climb up to grew a
dense clump of bushes only because it
was his plan to look everywhere did he
go up there at all on the ledge he saw
at once what from below had been
masked by the bushes

  there was a great hole into the cliff-
side through which a man might walk
standing erect beyond where dim dusk
brooded at midday was the cave a

glance as he went in showed that it was
part natures work and part man-made
at his feet lay a shovel with fairly fresh
dirt adhering to it beyond was a pick
other picks and shovels several of them
lay at one side of the long chamber

   paula he called softly  are you
here

  but paula was not there as he moved
on deeper into the cavern he saw that
no one was there there were two tum-
bled piles of blankets one on each side
against the wall by one of them were
five rifles all of old patterns not one
an automatic he picked them up one
after the other none was loaded there
were no unfired cartridges with them

  several sharpened stakes had been
driven into the walls which sheldon found
to be of clay almost rock-hard from
these pegs hung cured skins of both deer
and bear wildcat skins the pelts of other
animals from one was suspended a gay
little array of old old-fashioned gowns
like those in pictures of our grandmothers
sheldon sighed touched them lingeringly
and called again  paula

  he passed on down the length of the
cavern which had been driven thirty
or forty feet into the mountainside at
the far end a pick was sticking into the
wall near the pick was a bag made of
deerskin he struck it with his foot
it was heavy seemed filled with small
stones wondering he turned the con-
tents out upon the floor

  and at the sight disclosed there to him
in the dim interior of this gloomy place
the soul of john sheldon mining engi-
neer adventurer into the far-out places
thrilled within him

  the bag was half-filled with gold
nuggets

  bait for a madmans trap he said
aloud huskily  to catch the golden
emperor of space

  he went down on his knees the gold
caught up into his hands his eyes bright
with the old forgotten but never dying
fever he ran back to the caves open-
ing carrying his hands full staring at

the yellow crumbling particles light-
stricken he had never seen such gold
he had never believed gold existed like
this

  he whirled and hastened back into the
cavern going to the bag which still lay
on the floor the pick still in its flace
caught his eye he jerked it out break-
ing away a dozen handfuls of the hard
clay he struck the clay with his boot-
heel breaking it apart and from the
fragments which he carried to the light
there shone up at him the dull yellow of
gold

  the old old fever rode him hard hav-
ing taken him thus unaware leaping out
upon him from the dark of the unex-
pected his hands shook with it he
had found gold before he had known
the wild fires it sets in a mans brain
but never had he found gold like this
never had he known so seething a tumult

  all men look for the mother lode
he whispered  why shouldnt it be
waiting somewhere for the man who can
find it why shouldnt this be it

  he had forgotten paula a man for-
gets everything when he finds gold much
gold pure yellow virgin gold often
enough he ceases for the moment to be
a man and is like a wild beast hunger-
ing tearing at bloody meat

  he went here and there eager and
breathless driving the pick into the time-
hardened clay taking with shaking hands
the earth he dug out muttering to himself
as he found again and again that there
was in it the glint and gleam of gold

   there is nowhere in the world a man
so rich as i he whispered and then
he thought of paula

  he went out upon the ledge outside
and sat down in the sunshine and lighted
his pipe this gold was not john shel-
dons unless john sheldon were utterly
contemptible it was paulas her birth-
right was he the man to rob a woman
the man to cheat a girl a girl like
paula he shook his head

   i was drunk on the cursed stuff he
said half-angrily

  but if paula did not come back if
lcok as he might days came and went
the summer passed and paula did not
come back and he could not find her

  then a curious fact presented itself to
john sheldon it was this if he were
confronted with a choice in the matter
if he had to lose the wealth untold lying
at his finger-tips or lose forever the
golden-brown maiden-why he could
snap his fingers at the gold

  something has come over me he
grunted at the thought

  he had never been more right in his
life in his own words something had
come over him

chapter xiii

consummation

a month passed and john sheldon
who might have taken the gold
and left the girl let the gold lie
and sought paula

  they were lonely days and more than
once he went to his horse for compan-
ionship the provisions which he had
brought in with him had dwindled away
to nothing his coffee was gone he
drank water for breakfast his bacon
was but a haunting memory beans and
onions and potatoes were with the snows
of yesteryear

  he missed them but could manage
upon venison and trout but especially
after meals and before he turned in at
night when he looked into the black and
empty bowl of his pipe he shook his head
and sighed

  verily a mighty thing is a mans love
for a woman for even when his to-
bacco was a thing of the past john
sheldon a man who loved his smoke
stayed on and contented himself with
sunflower leaves

  he had once said  ill stay if i have
to wait until snow flies now he said
 ill find her if i have to stick on the
job all winter

there were days when he roamed for
the fire flower



miles into the mountains nights when
he slept far out as paula was perhaps
sleeping again there were times when
he slept in the cabin or at the mouth
of the cavern on the ledge

  many a time at dusk he climbed to
some peak to look down over the valley
and distant ridges hoping to see some-
where the blaze of her fire day after
day he sought some other cave some
other distant cabin where perhaps she
was hiding where it might be that sup-
plies had been cached against such a
time as this but the month went and
another was well on the way and his
search was fruitless

  there came a soft night throbbing
with star radiance glowing with the
promise of a full moon just rising be-
yond the eastern ridge when sheldon
tired and spiritless came back into
johnnys luck from a long tramp tojhe
north

  as he trudged back along the trail he
had come to know so well he told himself
that he was all kinds of a fool that if
he were not hed put all the gold upon
bucks back that a horse could stagger
under take upon his own shoulders all
that he could carry and go back to belle
fortune and the world beyond

  but he knew that he would not go
that he would remain there until he found
paula or knew that she was dead lately
he had come to fear that one of the
innumerable possible accidents had be-
fallen her

  head down weary and hopeless he
made his slow way toward the cabin
he was within a score of paces from the
house when he stopped with a sharp
exclamation standing staring

  she was there she had heard him
was before him to the door had come
out into the night to meet him the
man stood looking at her in bewilderment
for here was no paula whom he knew
no brown maiden of the bearskin no
boyish slip in miners boots and clothes

  oddly the memory of something he
had seen years ago and many miles from

here came into his mind vividly he had
once found one of those strange plants
called the fire-flower which flourish in
bleak desolation companionless a won-
derful creation with burning blood-red
heart which upon the barren sweep of
lava-beds is at once a living triumph and
a mystery of loveliness

  this girl here alone in the land of
abandoned ruins and lonely desolate
isolation was like that

  the fire flower

  paula came on taking short little steps
which alone made her some new paula
he looked down and saw a pair of in-
credibly small slippers seeming brand
new flashing in the moonlight he
looked up and saw paula smiling

   i have come back to you said
paula  because you are good and i love
you are you glad

  she had come back to him like a great
lady out of an old love-story her hair
was in little old-fashioned curls her neck
and throat gleamed at him modestly from
the laces and ribbons which bewildered
him upon her brown fingers were dainty
mitts of  and the gown itself it
was an elaborate and astounding ball-
gown all wide hoops and flounces so that
she seemed to him to be riding out to
him upon a monster puff-ball that her
costume should to the last detail be like
that of the lady of the picture she car-
ried in her hand a fan

  paula with a fan paula in hoop-
skirts

   you are not glad cried paula her
lips which had been curved to her laugh-
ter suddenly trembling

   glad cried john sheldon  glad 

  and a hundred things clamoring for
expression that was all that he said
paula put her head to one side like a
bird and looked at him he looked at
her her curls her sleeves her ribbons
her fan-

  then paula gifted with understand-
ing laughed

   are you afraid of me now she
asked softly


all-story weekly

   before god-yes muttered sheldon
huskily

   kiss me said paula

  she put up her red mouth temptingly
her eyes teasing and gay and sheldon
hesitated no longer and was afraid no
longer but took her into his arms hoop-
skirts and flounces and ribbons and laces
and all and held her tight tight

   oh laughed paula  you are like
a bear you hurt and you will ruin my
dress i have saved it always-always
and always-for-

   for what paula dear he asked

   for to-night-for you  she answered
her voice an awed whisper like his own

   but you didnt know-

   oh i always knew some time you
would come a man tall like poor father
and strong-and young-and beautiful
i would dream of it sometimes and it
would make me shiver like cold like
you make me shiver now

   oh my dear my dear said sheldon
 and i have been afraid you would never
come back i have walked mile after mile
looking for you

   i know  nodded paula brightly
 i watched you every day

   what he cried

   oh yes i will show you to-morrow
where i hid it is up there in the rocks
another cave like the one you fpund-
but you could never find this one unless
i showed you it is so cunningly hid
and every day i watched you and one
day i saw you go into the forest and
come back with a strange terrible beast
bigger than a black bear following you
and i was afraid and screamed i thought
that it would eat you and-

   beast asked sheldon

   yes but you had caught it and
tied a rope around its neck and were its
master oh i was glad i was so far
away you didnt hear me and proud
that you were so strong a man so brave
a man to capture a big beast bigger than
a bear-

   buck it was my horse child and
you dont even know what a horse is

   no answered paula wondering
 do they bite

   this one you shall ride-

  i wont cried paula ill run

away

  laughing they turned together to the
cabin where he soon had a splendid fire
going

   why did you wait all these days be-
fore coming back he asked her

   because she told him  i was afraid
at first but i saw you were good you
did not hurt things just to be bad when
you passed close enough to me i could
see that your face was kind

   go on grinned sheldon  dont
stop there

   and she ended happily  i wanted
to see what you would do whether you
would go on looking for me a long time
or whether you would forget me and go
away

   and if i had gone

   then said paula simply  i should
have gone high up on the cliffs and
thrown myself down it would not have
been much fun to live if you had gone
away

 and now he asked her soberly
 are you afraid to go back with me
paula back into the world outside
paula crept closer up to him putting
her hand into his

   yes she said  i am afraid

   but insisted sheldon  you must
see paula-

   i am afraid she repeated and as
he turned toward her he saw that her
eyes lifted to his were shining softly
with utter trust  i am afraid but i
will go with you and be glad

   god bless you he whispered

   tell me something she said pres-
ently  something i have not asked
you but have wanted to know

   yes paula what is it

he wondered just how far back in his
life history that question was going to
search she made herself comfortable in
his arms then she asked her question
 have you a name too
the fire flower



what he replied taken aback
 dont you even know my name

  no sighed paula the sigh bespeak-
 ing a vast and somewhat sleepy content
  what is it

  it is john sheldon he told her

 then-some day-i will be paula
john sheldon

  just as soon cried john sheldon
  as you and i can get to the nearest
 priest on the little smoky and we
 start in the morning

  aha mes enfans said the father
 dufresnil to the two other old men with
 whom he chummed at the settlement on

the

the little smoky it was ten days
later  the worp is fonny to me
to-day there comes out of the woods a
man such a man tall an big an his face
like a boy glad an with him a lady-
oh mes enfans a lady of beauty with
eyes which dance like the eyes of him
an this lady she is dress like the gran-
mother of ol thibault there-in a ball-
gown an i when i marry them oh
there was not to doubt the love in their
four eyes but see what that big man
put in my han

  he dropped it to the oilcloth of the

    the laughter in his wicked eyes

       this very day i heard the wight

        he wore no more the shaggy skin

a different story

nine hours out from bermuda
where the green waves snarl at
the blue like greedy cur dogs
burke laid himself back in his bunk and
gave himself up to the business of dying

  it was hot on the ship the little
stateroom was hazy with heat and the
electric fan beat the dead air an ineffec-
tual spinning blur the open port-hole
was a mere circular glimpse of brassy sea
and blinding sun affording no relief

  it took a long time to die

  burke prone on his dry restless pillow
wondered a little at the prolonged labor
of it the enduring weariness the relent-
less grip of a shattered body upon a tired
and sickened soul life had seemed to
him so frail a thing-a candle flame
flared into nothing by a breath why
was it so hard to die

  he had seen men die-in fever camps
among the gauijt silent pines in border
fights suddenly twitching-strangled by

floods or smothered by flames and al-
ways death had seemed an easy thing a
hand which sponged out the symbols of
the clay as though they were mere hand-
writing upon the waters

  but now the summer was nearly spent
and since the plum-trees blossoming
burke had been dying

  seven weeks in the bulb-farmers house
on the little inlet of glass-blue water-
seven weeks which had brought to him
each morning a stronger look of doom in
the eyes of henley-and now nine hours
on board ship and still he could not die

  henley waj a fine fellow-a fine doc-
tor he had fought the strange bursting
pain which swelled and quivered in
burkes breast-fought it with morphia
and with strange drugs with long names
even with cocain but the gnawing
devil who possessed burkes body was not
to be appeased with potions great phy-
sicians wise simple men had looked at


the man who was dead



burke and fingered his pulse and shaken
their honest heads queer unwashed
quacks sought out from strange corners
of the earth had worked their blatant
exorcisms in vain but still henley
fought on doggedly

  that henley loved jeanne burkes
strong beautiful daughter was a thing
the sick man knew well and also that the
miracles which the young doctor wrought
were miracles for love but in bermuda
burke had seen the desperate cheerful-
ness bum out of henleys face had seen
his hope conquered heard his voice sink
to the dead level of optimism which we
accord to dying men and children burke
saw these things with something of relief
henley had given up now he could die
he was eager to begin it

  lying there with the thick warm air
over him like a cloak he experimented
wondering a little how men set about
thrusting through this hindering of the
flesh he held his breath tentatively and
relaxed on the hot bed trying to wile his
coward spirit forth but the pain tore
at him beat and shook and rasped him
until his body was taut and dominant
again if only the pain would leave him
in peace he could die

  he turned a little on his side and
looked at the little bottle with the blue
label it held the drug which henley
had promised to try - the drug which
would give burke at least ten hours of
sleep-veronal at two he was to have it
it was twelve now-he could tell by the
hot slant of the sun in the port-hole at
two perhaps he could die

  of what use was his life for fifty-
five years it had blessed no man-not
even himself how he had wasted it
this little strand of golden thread which
had been given him how he had snarled
and tangled it dragging it into remote
and evil places tangling the feet of inno-
cent folk in the coils of it until now it
hung upon him like a loathsome web
which he could not shake off

  when he was gone jeanne would have
the money which burkes canny old

mother looking askance upon her wan-
dering son had entailed upon his daugh-
ter so long as burke lived the income
was his-a wasters penny spent before
it was gotten but at his death the whole
beautiful sum compounded and plethoric
from the nourishing of quiet accumula-
tion was jeannes

  jeanne would hoard it wisely-jeanne
and henley perhaps he thought with
grim humor they would build him a mon-
ument - he burke the unstable im-
mured forever beneath one unchanging
stone

  the sun slanted up the painted walls
glinted on the futile fan burnished the
plank ceiling the pain in burkes chest
thrust up and gripped at his throat
wringing his tongue dry setting every
fiber of him on edge he panted and
sweated picking frantically at the hot
sheet under him

  then henley came in henley was a
young man a little stooped with tired
eyes in the hospitals back in the states
henley had always been the first to plead
for morphia when the patients sweated
gray-faced with suffering burke saw
compassion in henleys eyes as he lay
livid with clutching fingers henley
would give him the veronal now then
perhaps when this rending of the flesh
had been subdued he could die

  with strong shaking fingers burke
pushed back the hot rumpled sleeve of
his pajama coat his eyes were eager as
he watched henley finger the blue-la-
beled bottle hesitantly his tongue was
like-sandpaper and speech was gone from
him but his eyes and his snatching fin-
gers commanded

  henley pushed the hypodermic into the
hot flesh burke could feel the tingling
fibers drinking gulping at the cool sleep
which drained from the merciful needle

  the brazen disk of the port-hole had
faded to a cool blue-gray shimmer when
burkes brain quickened and pierced
through the restful oblivion which had
possessed him the air in the stateroom
was fresher now and he could feel the

cool stirring of the fan was this death
-this strange lassitude which overcame
him this weakness which turned his
bones to pulp and his body to water

  he could not lift his fingers from the
sheet where they lay stiffening he could
not hold his eyelids open of their own
weight they closed his skin felt cold
and rigid upon his body strange-mov-
ing currents rushed in his ears

  how keen a mans mind grew at the
last how avid his ears burke could
hear the voices of the crew on the deck
outside hear the whispering mop of a gal-
ley boy in the corridor he could almost
detect the pulse-beat of some one who sat
in the room with him-henley undoubt-
edly

  once the person came to the bunk and
felt burkes pulse burke could not see
but he felt the warm wave from an ap-
proaching body on his face the pressure
on his chilling wrist did his heart still
beat he wondered how long it took to
die

  it was night now the light above
his bunk was burning he could feel the
rays smiting his eyeballs through closed
lids two men were whispering at the
door one was henley

   practically the end burke heard
henley say  you can hardly detect
any heart action with a stethoscope

  burkes lips were stiff and chill but
the vagabond soul of him grinned what
a joke-to hang about and watch his
body die

  did all men haunt their own flesh like
this he wondered what a damn fool
way to end it he wanted to be away-
to explore whatever came next and
here he floated like a silly vapor with ears
agape listening to the wash of the sea
on the port-holes and the tiptoeing of sol-
emn people overhead

  but the pain was gone all the things
of the body were gone every sensation
every desire a naked soul was a com-
fortable thing to live with was he dead
now

  he must be dead at last

  men were stepping softly into the
room speaking in hushed voices they
crossed his hands upon his breast some
one laid a cold wet cloth over his face

  at last

  but did he have to hang around this
husk of his forever

  it was dark and the heat had gone out
of the air burke found himself thinking
of jeanne-jeanne who had always been
loyal to her scapegoat father would
jeanne care-now that he was dead

  he had never done much for jeanne
he was sorry now that he was dead
since her mothers death she had been a
wide-eyed self-confident girl living a
haphazard life with relatives who despised
burke cordially he had brought her a
red dress once from a filibustering trip to
guatemala he was glad of that dress
it made him feel better now that he was
gone

  strange what ideas the preachers had
about death he had heard one at his
wifes funeral long ago orating about the
gates of onyx and streets of jasper and
the swelling music of the spheres he
had pictured death as a sort of torchlight
procession into a wealthy and melodious
land and here it was-no change at all
you simply withdrew a little way out of
your body and listened to what was going
on in the world what a joke on the
preachers

  it was morning now burke could hear
the clink of crockery in the galley the
scurry of feet above on deck the quick-
ened purr of the engines men were com-
ing down the corridor he could hear
them arguing henley and the captain
and the ships doctor

  they were going to bury him at sea-
that was it and henley was protesting
that they were only twenty-four hours
out-that the ship carried her own ice
henley was trying to save him for jeanne
to be anchored forever under a memorial
weight of stone burke was glad when
the captain prevailed the sea was free
and wide and no man knew what lay
therein burke had always loved the sea
the man who was dead



   there was no vision left to him hut lie
knew that they carried him up bn deck-
carried his rigid body with the soul of
him somehow trailing along he was con-
scious of the live stir of air outside of
the warmth of the sun even of the smell
of the sea

  they laid him down on a clean-smell-
ing canvas with a linen sheet folded about
him soon they would sew him in with a
lead weight at his feet they would
moor no dragging weight to his spirit he
knew he wondered where it would go
when his body slid still and stiff into the
sea

  death was a great adventure and
men feared it

  why didnt they finish him up the
captain a stolid english-lutheran had
gone below to rummage for his service
book

   we now commit his body to the
deep- burke remembered that much
of it

  they were all watching something on
the port bow something which had stolen
up out of the salty dawn something
which brought a shrill quality of fear
into the voices of the passengers burke
had heard it coming his spirit-ears
were very keen he had heard it creep-
ing with a soft crackling under the sur-
face of the sea

  a submarine

  men were running along the decks
now he could hear sharp cries loud
commands the yelp of the megaphone
purring bells the frightened leap of the
engines

  how did a submarine happen to be on
this side and why should it attack this
ship-a slow peaceful boat loaded with
wool and onions there were not many
passengers aboard burke remembered-
only henley and himself and a few farm-
ers from the islands of polyglot nation-
alities

  they were making the boats ready
now he could hear the tackle rattle in
the chocks the screws leaped breath-
lessly flinging the boat forward in great

plunging jerks but by the low tense
voices of those on deck burke knew that
the under-sea boat was gaining-that it
was frankly pursuing them

  suddenly the ship gave a quiver as
though she winced from a blow there
was a sound of ripping amidships on the
port side and a sharp sulfuric odor and
a jar then the deck under burke heaved
up with -a roar and dust and splinters
fell in his face he could hear water
rushing below

  the engines choked roared and
stopped feet tore up the companion-
ways there was much loud shouting
and the nervous rattle of boats being low-
ered burke heard henleys voice-even
unafraid there were plenty of boats
the young doctor was saying and the
new jersey coast was only a night away

  then it was still the ship was roll-
ing and burkes stiff body rolled a little
way across the shattered deck the water
was washing over him now and his feet
rose foolishly as the waves smote them

   we now commit his body to the
deep

  how easily his body floated if only
they had got that lead weight fixed the
rites would have been accomplished auto-
matically the ship must be going down
he could feel the whirl and suck of the
waters the suction kept him spinning
but still he floated death had been with-
held from him and now burial was de-
nied him even the sea refused his bones

  the ship was gone now the sea
quivered but the violent heaving had
ceased the boats were gone they
would not linger near the vortex of a
plunging ship to salvage him-a worth-
less dead man he was alone all the
face of the moving waters was his

  then a soft sound of washing waves
came to his ears a liquid gurgling sound
of something rising from the sea the
submarine-he had forgotten it it was
coming up now creeping near to see what
ruin it had wrought he heard the flip
of a screw-voices

  they spoke a language he knew burke


all-story weekly

knew many languages now they were
shouting a man plunged overboard
burke could hear his splashing progress
as he wallowed nearer then a hand
clutched him

  ha felt himself towed inert unresist-
ing violently through the torn water
the hull of the under-water craft rose
sleek and slippery as the belly of a fish
with a line they dragged him up bent
him double thrust his stiff limbs through
a hatch

  men bent over him talking in a tongue
that he knew one laid his stiff hands
straight

   dead he muttered

  but another contradicted him in a tone
of authority rolling burkes eyelids back
with a practised forefinger

   this mans not dead he declared
hes been drugged

  they brought a strange steel apparatus
and pressed it against his chest they
inflated his sunken ribs and sent a cur-
rent rending through his spine and all
the while burke lay and grinned in his
soul of course he was dead what
fools to try to bring a dead man back to
life

  then suddenly something flashed
through his rigid body snatching his soul
rudely out of the restful inertia where it
had floated

  it was the pain

  the pain

  he was alive

  he was alive

  as the strained fibers of him vibrated
with the returning current of life burke
felt a hot anger surge through him med-
dling fools why had they disturbed
him-tortured him back to earth-thrust
this diseased clay with its pangs upon
his tired soul

  he opened his eyes-they came open
quite easily now-and looked at the men
who stood around him kindly men they
were with tired eyes men who looked
like the fathers of sons and the sons of
fathers and yet not an hour ago they
had sent a peaceful merchant ship careen-

ing to the bottom of the smothering
ocean

  an old man with a white mustache
bent over him his fingers were on
burkes pulse his straight strong lips
curved in a smile

   hes coming out he said in the
tongue which burke understood  hes
had a stiff dose-combined with acute an-
gina pectoris i have seen such suspend-
ed animation only once-in freiburg

  burke closed his eyes again wearily
now it was all to do over again - the
thing he had thought well done again
he cumbered the earth a disgrace to his
friends a blight upon jeanne why
couldnt they have let him die

  they were discussing him two of
them were arguing he must be put
ashore there was some discussion about
the boat but burke only lay still very
weary hating the body with its pangs
which he had been forced to reclaim

  the old man gave him something
through a hypodermic and the pain les-
sened he felt stronger quieter even a
little hungry they brought broth in a
quill and dripped it between his set jaws
his lips were cracked and cold and the
salt of the broth stung them they
wrapped him in hot dry clothes and
rolled him in a heavy blanket

  then they put him ashore a boat
came out from some little cove and crept
alongside the bulging belly of the sub-
marine two men went into it - two
men and burke

  he did not see where they were going
his eyes were still weary and he kept
them closed but his ears were keen as
ever-as keen as when he had thought
himself dead he heard the boat grate
on gravel and the voices of men speaking
english he heard the rumble of a mo-
tor and the swish of long grass beside the
path

  then the men who spoke english car-
ried him away in the motor he did not
care if he could not die it did not mat-
ter greatly where he went he wondered
vaguely whether henley was saved-
the - man who was dead



henley and the captain and the ships
doctor henley had given him too much
veronal but he had meant well-poor
old henley then whatever it was that
the white-mustached one had given him
overcame him and he slept soundly for
the first time in hours his avid brain was
still

  when he awoke he was in a hospital
he krtew it for a free hospital by the rows
of beds and the unironed coarse garment
that he wore there was an ice cap on
his head and a cool moist bandage lay
lightly over his dry stretched mouth
burke lay back with a sigh he knew
hospitals for agonized places aching with
loneliness he had lain in many from
buenos aires to stockholm all alike
they were

  at last they let him go they gave him
strange cheap clothes which did not fit
him they gave him no money-hardly
a civil farewell the pain was better and
he felt stronger but he was still a sick
man-sick and penniless and alone in a
strange place he could not work he
did not know how to beg that was one
scalawags trade which he had never tried
-begging

  he would go back to jeanne

  jeanne was loyal she would take him
in and care for him then perhaps soon
he would die and she would be free

  he had a ring left yet-a little cheap
ring he pawned it for enough to land
him on the jersey side sixteen miles from
new york he could beat his way in

  he had traveled from bonong to tam-
pa on a fruit boat once eleven thousand
miles eating at the captains table and
paying nothing he knew how to work
it it is proof of burkes skill that he
did work it he arrived in new york-
riding in a pullman car with money in his
pocket there are still men who ride
pullman cars who think they are clever
with cards

  in the city burke went straight to the
little house on twelfth street he had
been gone four months the leaves were
off the vines now the flowers were dead

in the window boxes he could see the
light of a fire through the window

  very softly he closed the little iron
gate and climbed the two steps he
could see the room through the half-
closed curtains

  jeanne was there-and henley she
was sitting on the arm of hanleys chair
and they were studying a book together
burke could see the pictures in the book
it was an automobile catalogue

  then he remembered the money
of course the money was jeannes she
had that-the only thing he could give
her the red dress had been so little
he was glad that jeanne had the money
then with a start that pained him he
realized that now he was alive the money
was his again-the income of it as long
as he lived

  he had done so little for jeanne

  if he had died

  he cursed the foreign crew with fer-
vent tongue

  then came a chilling thought jeanne
did not know that he was alive to
jeanne and henley he was only an in-
dulged memory hidden from troubling
under a sleeping sea

  to jeanne he was dead

  he turned away

  straight down the two steps he went
and into the street the pain surged up
quickly in his breast but he fought it
down

  he would miss henley henley knew
what to do for the pain but he walked
away and did not look back

  at the grand central he boarded a
fast train very magnificent the world
was under his feet again and his face was
set upon the old road

  for jeannes sake he was dead

  those gentlemen the editors who hold
their fingers continually upon the capri-
cious public pulse maintain that nowa-
days the people will have nothing but
love stories

  gentlemen i insist that this is a love
story

chapter vii

scapegoat

dr gould was making his after-
noon round of calls he reached
the eliot mansion a few minutes
after the death

  devore had gone in from the corridor
he stood beside the door sternly
solemn miss devore sat with arthur
eliot near the bed her face pressed
against his shoulder nan was making
the final entry on the sickchart

  the physician looked close into the
face of the patient he had lost and
shuffled across to nan perplexedly
shaking his bald head she put the
chart into his outstretched hand he
looked at it and then at her with a
frown that failed to mask his deepened
perplexity

   you recharged the syringe this
morning he queried

   yes sir

 where is it

  she handed him the empty syringe
he peered at it and then at the last
entries on the chart

   you are sure this is correct you
gave the hypodermic-there followed a
few seconds of relaxation-after that a
recurrence of the paroxysm

  mr arthur eliot was present
doctor

   most peculiar - unaccountable
muttered the physician he gestured her
toward the corridor and went to tap the
young man on the shoulder  your
pardon mr eliot - a word with you
please

  when all were out in the hall he held
up the empty syringe

   mr eliot did you see miss rose
use this

  the hypodermic - yes doctor i
must say she was very quick about it
and steady

  the puzzled physician blinked pon-
dered and spoke curtly to nan that

seems to bear you out you are no

longer needed here get ready and re-
port back at the hospital without delay
nan turned a level glance upon eliot
but he was bending over the mournfully
drooped figure of miss devore as she
passed through the doorway dr gould
started to follow her devore stepped
in front of him

   beg pardon doctor but this matter
that seems to be troubling you-

  how you mean-

  devore twiddled his monocle  er-
its deuced awkward yknow to have to
say anything only that young woman-

   whats that demanded eliot his
grief-clouded eyes fixed upon the hesita-
ting speaker

   better tell it lennie now youve
started murmured missr devore  we
have no secrets from arthur

   its about her if you insist upon
hearing slowly admitted devore
 probably nothing to it but dr gould
seems to think theres something wrong
 that hypodermic given as pre-
scribed should have checked the
paroxysm of the heart stated the
physician

   but what if- devore stopped
short and pressed his lips together

  go on urged eliot his brows
knotted in a worried frown  out with
it len

   if i must then you see i noticed
an odd look in the young womans
eyes when she ran for the hypo-what-
dyou-call-it-squirt recalled the look
when she came out here and told that
your father was-gone kind of look
youd expect if the party had made a-
fatal mistake i took the liberty to call
up her hospital and inquire in your
name if miss rose had a - clear record
regarding-mistakes

  well

   hospital superintendent referred me
to dr gould

  arthur eliot faced the physician his
eyes stern you know

   it was only her first or second case
over a year ago muttered dr gould

 there was no such chance here-only
the one solution for the hypodermic-
all the rest capsules unless she pur-
posely-

   oh no doctor no do not say it
protested miss devore  is it not pos-
sible the nurse only made a mistake
what if in refilling the-the hypo-thing
she had absent-mindedly used water
the great strain of nursing you know
can one blame her if when dazed from
a hard night she made such an innocent
slip

 water mumbled the physician-
 water that would explain it i will
test what is left in the needle

   whats the use murmured eliot
and his head sank forward dejectedly
 hes gone-and all my fault for anger-
ing him

   carelessness is inexcusable in a
nurse declared the physician crabbedly

  he opened his medical case as the
young man went out with his hand
clashed between miss devores tenderly
sympathetic palms devore lingered to
see the physician unscrew the needle
from the barrel of the hypodermic
syringe

  when nan came down the side stairs
in her street uniform she found the
chauffeur waiting to take her for the
usual afternoon drive though the news
of the masters death had been whispered
from attic to cellar of the mansion no
one had countermanded the chauffeurs
orders and the man was too severely
trained to do anything on his own
initiative	

  the sight of the car brought a grateful
glow into the girls cheeks she thought
that this attention was due to the
courtesy of arthur eliot she had been
carried half way to her favorite park
before the realization of the direction to
which the chauffeur was holding and the
remembrance of his masked surprise over
her uniform and valise combined to dis-
illusion her at the first trolley line she
dismissed the man and boarded a trolley
car that was bound toward the hospital


all-story weekly

  her feelings when she mounted the
familiar steps were not altogether un-
pleasant she had escaped the drudgery
of ward work for a time and she had
done creditable service now she would
go at the routine harder than before
she would compel every one to realize
her earnestness and ability she did not
care for their liking but their respect
would gratify her pride

  at this hour the superintendent usually
was on one of his rounds of inspection
she hoped to slip in and report for duty
tc the matron but as she topped the
steps she saw that he was at his desk
and it would appear waiting for her
dour as was the look with which he met
her it failed to prepare her for his
words

   so you have returned-at your
leisure quite in keeping with your rec-
ord you are discharged here is the
balance of your salary due you to date--
sixteen dollars and forty-three cents
pack your belongings and leave hete at
once

  nan stood for a long moment dum-
founded when she forced her stiffened
lips to speak her voice was hardly more
than a whisper

   this-it is most unjust i shall ap-
peal to the board

   do so and welcome dr gould will
prefer the charges

   charges-what-whatever- why
he said nothing-not a word

   naturally it was after you had
left that he found you had filled the
hypodermic syringe with water instead
of the solution prescribed

  nans eyes dilated  water impos-
sible an angry scarlet flared across
her whitening face  its a trick - a
contemptible trick gould is lying be-
cause mr eliot insisted upon keeping
me the cur how dare he tell such
a lie

   denounce him to the board ad-
vised the superintendent with a coldness
that chilled her righteous heat  if you
wish to know the truth dr gould tested

the drop left in the needle it contained
so slight a trace of the solution that it
failed to react a mr devore witnessed
the test

  the office reeled before nan she
stood swaying her eyes so dark from the
dilation of their pupils that they ap-
peared altogether black her world was
crashing down about her head-all her
hopes her career her ideals

  the superintendent went on inexor-
ably  i warned you the hospital can-
not condone mistakes

  nan reached out her small hands to
him in anguished appeal  i did not-
it is the truth-i did not make any mis-
take i filled it with the solution you
must believe me-you must

   there is also your first mistake the
superintendent reminded her  i should
have discharged you then the reputa-
tion of the hospital has been endangered
take your choice go quietly without
references or appeal to the board and
have your record made public

  pride stiffened nans knees as they
were beginning to bend in supplication
her red head tilted back on her straight-
ening shoulders she caught up her
valise and turned toward the street door

   wait said the superintendent
 you have permission to pack your
other belongings

   thanks theyre about as valuable
as the reputation you are giving me
after ive slaved all this time for your
godly house of healing

 the man winced he thought him-
self no more than sternly just

   you know best whether the effects
you leave are valueless miss rose
but here is your check

   put it in your conscience fund
youll need it the girl sought to wither
him

  hardly was she through the doorway
when she regretted the taunt pride
held her from turning back for the
check yet even in the white heat of
her anger common sense told her that
she could not spare the few dollars that
his temporary wife



she had saved from her nominal salary
there was no one from whom she could
borrow and she had with her oniy a few
small coins

  at the corner drug-store she addressed
impersonally to the hospital an order
for her check to be delivered to the
bearer a newsboy fetched the check to
her and threw in a penny paper with the
service all for a dime

  the paper gave her a list of lodgings
and the advertisement of- a dress sale
she walked to the store and bought her-
self a ten-cent hat shape a few remnants
to trim it and a very cheap suit the
material of the dress was coarse but
strong the cut was defective but the
color harmonized with her vivid hair

  because-of her hospital uniform the
store cashed her check without hesita-
tion she rode across town on a trolley
car and looked up a number of lodgings
in a poor but respectable quarter of the
city

  her final choice was a cramped cubby-
hole hall-room that looked down into a
clothes-line area yet low as was the
rent when she had paid her month in
advance there was only a dollar and
sixty-five cents left in her purse

  the five cents bought her two loaves
of stale bread at the bakery around the
corner the thought of the rich dainties
which she had listlessly nibbled at
luncheon brought a smile to her de-
pressed lips as she sat down to her bread
and water

   anyway it  be good for my com-
plexion she murmured

chapter viii

the tempter

that evening and early in the
morning nan worked so hard to
trim her hat and refit the dress that
she had a trig fashionable costume com-
plete before office hours but she did
not change from her nurses street uni-
form

   she was the first person in the waiting-
room of the physician who had seemed
kindest to her at the hospital he
listened sympathetically to her frank
statement and explained with grieved
softness that professional ethics would
not permit him to differ from the con-
clusions of his esteemed colleague dr
gould

  nan stoutly declined his charitable
offer of a bank-note  i am not a beg-
gar thank you

  the second physician whom she tried
bruskly showed her his door the instant
she mentioned her discharge from the
hospital another one was out two
others vaguely promised to consider her
application for work still another fu-
riously assailed dr gould as a fool and
a quack but wound up with the state-
ment that he had no need of a nurse he
put nans name on a list below the names
of a dozen other nurses

  she went last to the physician she
least fancied he was a black-bearded
suave-mannered man whose non-profes-
sional reputation had been given no lit-
tle whispered discussion in the hospital
he was so agreeable and deferential to
nan that she accepted his invitation out
to lunch to discuss her suitability for
one of his cases

  when he smiled at her across the
secluded cafe table she knew what to
expect but she was tired and hungry
and ready to repay him in kind she
toyed with her wine glass frequently
raising its brim to her lips only to put
the wine down unsipped and she held
off or eluded his advances with coy
coquetry until her last spoonful of
mousse had melted on her tongue

   my dear doctor she murmured as
she dipped her childlike finger-tips in
the bowl and dried them with the dainty
elegance that she had practised at the
eliot mansion-  my dear doctor this
has been a most delightful little lunch-
eon i must compliment you on your
good taste if not your good intentions
however the situation you suggest is


all-story weekly

i fear one for which i am not suited
good day

  she was gone before he could recover
from his indignant amazement and pay
the rather large check

  refreshed by this despoiling of the
egyptian nan drew up a list of physi-
cians whom she did not know in ap-
plying to them she volunteered no state-
ment of her discharge from the hospital
but some recognized her uniform and
questioned her others asked for her
diploma or for references

  on the morning of the third day op-
portunity at last came to her in the sud-
den call of a physician to perform an
operation the emergency -was so acute
that the patient could not be moved to
a hospital and there was not time to hunt
up a nurse when the call was tele-
phoned nan was just stating that she
wished work without stopping to ques-
tion her the physician rushed her to his
little roadster and drove to the home of
his patient

  the operation was successful but
for four days with a kitchen apron over
her street uniform nan fought a losing
fight for the life of her patient after
the end the physician found time to in-
quire about her past the honest ac-
count gave him the chance to relieve
his chagrin over the loss of his firsi
surgical case with a show of mag-
nanimity he saw that she was paid the
exact amount due for trained nursing
he then warned her he would inform all
the medical fraternity of the city that
she was wearing the hospital uniform to
obtain employment under false pretenses

  for two days nan lay in her tiny hall-
room before she could recuperate from
the strain of the surgical case and the
dejection over her shattered hopes she
now had dr gould the hospital this
physician and the one who had lunched
her all actively interested in depriving
her of employment as a nurse

  she must seek her living in other fields

  while overhauling her scant belong-
ings she came upon the sealed en-

velope given her by the millionaire so
shortly before his death she stared at
his written instruction that it was to be
opened sixty days after the event that
had come upon him and upon her with
such tragic suddenness a wave of hot
resentment flared in her face and she
flung the envelope back into her valise
out of his hogshead of wealth he could
so easily have willed her the few golden
drops that would have paid her way to
culture and independence

  willed the word sent a wild thought
whirling through her fancy though
altogether improbable was it not possible
that he had put such a bequest into his
will down under all his display 
cynical selfishness he must have liked
her else he would not have made the
fantastic offer to marry her even his
half-insane animosity against his son
could not have induced him to make such
a proposal if she had not been pleasing
to him

  next morning when judge laton came
puffing into his offices he found a very
small and demure young lady with titian
hair seated at the head of his waiting
clients his restless roving glances be-
trayed no sign of recognition until she
was brought to him in his private office

   miss rose i believe he boomed as
he waved her to a chair  what can i
do for you

  nan silently handed to him the sealed
envelope he read the note on it with
avid interest and shot a shrewd glance
at the girl

   appears to be the writing of my late
client the deceased howard eliot the
meaning of the words is clear and ex-
plicit no need of a lawyer to interpret
the clause

   yes sir but-it was so peculiar that
he should give it to me to hold replied
nan  i do not know what to make of
it perhaps it is of no value yet there
is the chance that it may be very precious
to some one what if i should lose it

 you appear to be a capable
custodian
his temporary wife



   yet if i should you see it is a
kind of trust from him so if there is any-
thing about it in his will that you do not
consider improper to tell me-

  judge latons whitish eyes flickered a
glance at her anxious face he answered
her with gruff regret

   sorry the will has been probated
your name is not in it no mention of
this envelope only thing you can do
is to hold it in accordance with his in-
structions

  nan drew herself to her feet  thank
you sir if there is any charge for your
advice i must ask you to wait until i
get employment

  he darted a piercing look at her
 you have left your hospital

  pride goaded nan to tell the bitter
truth  i was discharged

  the uplifting of the lawyers shaggy
eyebrows led her into giving the detailed
account of the millionaires death and all
that had followed while she talked he
sent his restless gaze roving about the
office and strummed on his desk with
his pudgy fingers

  when she had finished he asked her to
repeat what had happened immediately
before the death afterward he inquired
her address she bit her lip hesitated
and gave the street and number

   that will do good day he curtly
dismissed her

  as she left the great office building
arthur eliot swung his touring car in
beside the curb with him sat the blond
miss devore radiantly aristocratic be-
hind them devore lolled in bored
grandeur miss devore stepped out-
and saw nan she immediately diverted
eliots attention in the other direction
they entered the building together while
nan slipped away through the throngs of
pedestrians

  within a hundred paces some one
jogged her elbow she looked up and
met the gallant smile of devore his
bow and lifted hat brought only a cold
stare of the gray eyes that betrayed no
hint of recognition

   my dear miss rose surely you can-
not have forgotten me so soon he de-
plored

   my dear sir she rejoined  i really
have no remembrance of your having ever
been presented to me

  presented he echoed  clever-
deuced clever but the same roof
yknow-that is an introduction-at mr
eliots

   i was not aware of the fact nor am
i now

   ah well whats such a little matter
between mutual friends of artie

  nan pointed to the policeman on the
corner  you see that nice big son of
erin with a face like a meat-ax

   yes

   would it not be painful algernon if
the nice big son of erin should take hold
of the collar of a little yellow thing called
a masher

  devores florid face went fiery red he
stopped short nan went on without a
backward glance after her contemptu-
ous thrust she felt positive that he would
never again venture within reach of her
scorn

  the rest of the day she spent in a vain
search for work everywhere she found
that employers required either expert
ability or references as to character often
both this applied to all work that- might
be called respectable

  day after day from morning to night
she walked about the city in search of
decent employment but the season was
slack hundreds of skilled girl workers
in every line were seeking jobs

  after two weeks she attempted piece-
work in a laundry the quality of her
work gave satisfaction not so the quan-
tity she lacked strength to push the
heavy iron at the speed required to earn
the food that would renew her strength
she dragged on at the killing labor until
with merciful callousness the forewoman
discharged her as incompetent

 rent day cleared her purse of all ex-
cept a few pennies driven desperate
she started to look for a position at do-


all-story weekly

mestic service fortified by a story that
her trunk had been stolen soon after her
arrival from oregon this falsehood the
first that she had used gained her a place
as housemaid at three dollars a week

  the work was light and there was
plenty of plain wholesome food she was
beginning to regain her strength and
plumpness when her mistress came to her
with an anonymous letter it told only
the truth about her discharge from the
hospital but with her renewed strength
her pride would not permit her to deny
the facts or appeal for leniency

  and it would not permit her to seek
another place under false representations

  a week later her search through the
want columns of discarded newspapers
was rewarded by an advertisement for a
housemaid that ended in the unique state-
ment  appearances preferred to refer-
ences

  she was very tired when a long walk
brought her to the suburban address
named the house set alone in the midst
of a block full of shrubs and old trees
and enclosed from the poor neighborhood
by high brick walls it had the appear-
ance of a fine old farmhouse converted
into a country residence and then used
as an inn

  a few feet inside the open gate of the
drive she spied a bench among the bushes
she crept in to it to rest and tidy her-
self before applying at the house this
necessary preening had not yet been fin-
ished when she was startled by the purr-
ing rush of a big touring-car that
swooped down the street and shot into
the drive

  where she sat even her vivid hair was
invisible to the occupants of the car but
from her side they were easy to see
through the screen of foliage devore was
driving and eliot sat behind with miss
devore nan stole out and away her
face flushed with shame

  another ten days found her close upon
desperation she was weak from hunger
when for the second time devore accost-
ed her on the street he approached her

openly with no trace of gallantry in his
concerned face

   i beg your pardon for speaking miss
rose he apologized but i cant help
noticing you look about pegged happens
ive had a run of luck wouldnt know
the difference if you accepted a little loan
till youre out of the hole

  nan held out her hand and gazed
straight into his eyes as he drew a bill-
fold from his pocket try as he would
he could not mask that which lurked be-
hind his surface smile nan took the
two yellow treasury notes and flung them
into his face

  anger enabled her to reach her miser-
able hall-room there she collapsed on
the cot and lay sobbing in dry-eyed an-
guish she was close to the verge any-
thing except the lightest work would now
be beyond her strength-and she could
not even get hard work there seemed
left only the river or-men like devore

  piece by piece she had pawned her
valise and all her clothes except the
cheap hat and dress her purse was
empty she had no food and the rent was
due the next day

chapter ix

on the verge

she awoke at dawn somewhat re-
freshed by sleep but suffering from
pangs of hunger that water seemed
only to make the more poignant

  an irresistible impulse drove her to
the window she leaned far out above
the littered area to drop head first upon
the cement would make a quick ending of
it all and people would think the fall an
accident

  her dilated eyes stared downward
measuring the distance and the chances
of striking clear between the wall and her
landladys garbage-can something whit-
ish atop the uncovered refuse of the can
caught her gaze she saw that it was a
crust of bread

all else than ravenous yearning for
his temporary wife



that crust vanished from her famine-tor-
tured brain she drew back to slip on
one of her worn broken shoes and drop
the other out of the window as she
twisted about to unbolt the door she
vaguely noticed a wrapped newspaper
lying as if it had been thrust through the
wide crack at the bottom she left it un-
touched and hobbled down the stairs
aquiver with haste and desire

  the odor of coffee and bacon in the
landladys kitchen almost drove the girl
frantic with a desperate effort at self-
control she managed to point to her shoe-
less foot and mumble an explanation
the woman grudgingly let her out into
the rear area

  the shoe was lying close beside the
garbage-can as xan bent down with
her back to the door she clutched the
coveted hunk of bread it was moldy
but so gloriously large that she had to
jam it hard to get it into the shoe at
the edge of the can was a piece of gristle
she could not resist the temptation to
crowd it in on top of the bread

  greed brought its penalty when she
slipped back into the kitchen the suspi-
cious woman noticed the bulging top of
the shoe

   whatchu got there she demanded
its mine-mine panted nan her
eyes glittering

  the woman grasped her arm and tore
the shoe from her by main force she
peered in at the gristle and moldy crust

   my gawd she gasped  robbin
the pigs

  nan made a fierce clutch for her prize
 its mine i tell you-mine you
threw it away give it to me

   you-you- spluttered the woman
 my gawd starvin an never a cheep
you spunky little devil

  she swung nan around bodily and
forced her into a chair at the kitchen
table one big red hand continued to
grip the girls shoulder the other hand
clapped down a slab of bread before her
slopped out a cup of muddy coffee and
dosed it liberally with milk and sugar

   thats all yuh git now honey she
grunted  youre too far gone to stum-
mick bacon

  the girl washed down a mouthful of
bread with a gulp of coffee took another
bite and burst into a storm of weeping

  thats it honey let yerself go
youve held in too long git it out
urged the woman

  hunger helped nans pride to moderate
and check the outburst of sobbing but
her tears continued to brim over they
ran down into her cup as she gulped the
hot coffee midway of a second big slice
of bread pride began to top hunger as
well as emotion she started to rise

   ive imposed on you enough she
said  i cant pay you

   whatchu think i am yuh little red-
headed she lucifer reproached her ben-
efactress  aint it no pay to know a
girl what cn starve ruther n go bad-
a purty one like you at that now take
this here bread an git my man  be
turnin out soon

  nan slipped on her shoe the woman
forced another slab of bread into her
hands and at sound of a snort in the
room off the kitchen shoved her out into
the hall

  though her legs were strangely wabbly
nan danced up the stairs as if her feet
weighed no more than feathers the
bread that she had eaten had eased her
worst craving and the hot coffee aided
by the unexpected kindness of the land-
lady had stimulated her almost to intoxi-
cation

  just inside her doorway her unsteady
foot flipped the wrapped newspaper un-
der the cot she bolted the door laid her
precious bread on the shelf and fished
under the cot for the newspaper it was
the first article of mail to be delivered to
her at the lodging-house but her name
and address were clearly typewritten on
the wrapper

  she tore it open and saw that the pa-
per was an early edition of the previous
afternoons issue among the classified
want-ads was a marked item in the per-


all-story weekly

sonal column she read the item and re-
read it with widening eyes it was brief
and clear

wanted-temporary wife immediate sep-
  aration liberal pay to right party

  the address was that of the suburban
place where she had seen devore drive in
with eliot and miss devore

  her first thought was that he had sent
her the advertisement as a lure she ex-
amined the sheet of thin tough writing-
paper that had been used as a wrapper
the letterhead had been torn off but the
watermark  legal bond suggested a
clue to her stimulated brain

  yet if judge laton really was the send-
er what could have been his motive she
pondered the puzzle for many minutes
until the disquieting thought flashed upon
her that the opportunity might already
have been lost there had been all the
previous evening for others to apply

  questionable as was the proposition
she was not in a position to stickle over
conventionalities if there was no actual
wrong in the affair the chance that
judge laton had sent the paper gave the
matter sufficient face value to make it
worth investigating

   after as careful a toilet as was possible
with her limited facilities she started to
wrap up her slice of bread on the shelf
beside it lay the sealed envelope given
into her keeping by howard eliot there
was a chance that she might not return
to her room for some time she slipped
the letter into her bosom

  after wrapping the slice of bread in
the newspaper she went down to tell the
landlady that she had heard of a possible
position the location of the address
wrenched from the woman a grunt of pro-
test and a nickel

   ride out yuh wanta look fresh
when yuh strike em she advised

  nan took the nickel and rose on tiptoe
to kiss what to her had been one of the
most repulsive of human faces the wo-
man backed away from her

   dont try any soft-soapin on me

yuh gotta pay me back with inturst if
yuh git a job

   a hundred per cent promised nan
as she started off bright-eyed and light
of heart

  the trolley-car brought her to her des-
tination much stronger than when she had
started on the way she had eaten part
of her bread lunch

  she went up the curving drive to the
house where a large pasty-faced woman
with yellowish eyes sat on the rustic
porch crocheting after this guardian of
the entrance had glanced at nan and the
marked item the purring voice in which
she asked nan to be seated bore out her
resemblance to a big tabby cat she
told nan that the parties who had ap-
plied the evening before had all been un-
satisfactory to the gentleman and that
his renewed ad in the morning papers set
the hour of noon for callers

   but seeing that youre here miss you
may as well wait she added  those
others were different you show class
make yourself at home my house is
very restful and private sometimes i
take in roomers who want to be quiet
that is why i call it a residence-inn but
my real business is arranging little enter-
tainments for the bon ton

  after a half-hour of chit-chat over va-
rious members of the smart set lhe pro-
prietress took nan for a stroll through
the shrubberies and left her under an
arbor the girl ate the last of her lunch
and curled up luxuriously in a hammock
its gentle swaying the warm pure leaf-
scented air and her feeling of repletion
and well-being lulled her to sleep

  she was awakened by a soft stroking
of her forehead that suggested furtive-
ness a voice purred in her ear

   the gentleman has arrived miss i
told him you was a lady and he will be
pleased to see you before the others
youre class youll not forget i put in
a word for you if things come your
way

   thank you i shall remember said
nan
his temporary wife



  pride stiffened her knees as she straight-
ened up before the blinking yellow-eyed
tabby woman she adjusted her hair and
hat and dress and followed the proprie-
tress with no outward sign of her inward
fear and trembling

  the woman led her past a waiting
limousine and into the large old-fashioned
parlor of the house a cased stairway
and a narrow upper hall brought them to
the closed door of the rear up-stairs room
nan drew back when the proprietress
scratched gently on the panel

chapter x

a matrimonial bargain

the door was opened by an elegantly
dressed heavily veiled lady she
beckoned nan to enter beyond
her on the far side of the room the girl
saw a tall young man he was facing
about from the door but she caught a
glimpse of his profile

  her first impulse was to run away but
the lady had already recognized her

   so it is you miss rose a muffled
voice murmured through the veil  please
to come in

  nan no longer hesitated the situa-
tion could be no more embarrassing to
her than to him and with him present
she lost all her dread of a trap that the
veiled lady was miss devore was self-
evident nan walked in past her and
across the room to stop at the young
mans elbow

   is the advertisement yours mr
eliot she inquired

  he whirled about to stare at her dum-
founded a deep flush crimsoning his dark
face  you-here

   in response to this advertisement
she explained  i wish to apply if there
is nothing wrong about the affair-and i
am sure there is not if you are the per-
son who advertised

  eliot looked at her with a pleased re-
laxing from his embarrassment  it is
very kind of you to say that miss rose

may we ask you to be seated they
have been overworking you i fear

   i need a change from what i have
been doing replied nan

  she sat down in one of the two chairs
that he drew around miss devore took
the other he stood before them and
drove straight at the purpose of their
meeting

   there is no need to conceal anything
from you miss rose this is the situa-
tion to comply with certain provisions
of my fathers will i must marry some
one else than my fiancee miss devore
yet from my fathers last words i feel
certain he wished to revoke this will i
therefore believe i am justified in holding
only to the strict letter of its provisions
this may be done by entering into a mar-
riage which shall be no more than a legal
form the other party would sign a con-
tract immediately to separate from me
and not contest a divorce

  nan reflected on this and asked
 what would be the reason given to get
the divorce

  eliot looked at her appreciatively
 you hear that verna she puts it be-
fore the matter of compensation my
dear miss rose there are two or three
statutory grounds for divorce that imply
no moral blame on either side for in-
stance incompatibility or refusal to live
as husband or wife

   neither would be so very dreadful
admitted nan

   not at all remarked miss devore
with an almost imperceptible tremor of
eagerness under the cold formality of her
tone  you need not appear in court
the case could go by default as they
say or if you preferred the case could
be brought in your name and defaulted
by mr eliot that is the usual way
and it would enable you to ask the right
to resume your own name

   i understand said nan very quiet-
ly  my own name-i would not retain
even his name

   would that be desirable to either
side put in eliot  i need not tell you


all-story weekly

that the less publicity this matter is given
and the sooner it is forgotten the more
agreeable it will be for all concerned

   quite true assented nan  only i
was thinking of but two sides of the
question and now i see there is a third
i am sorry but it is no use talking i
know now i cannot go on

  she started up and hurried toward the
door behind her she heard miss devore
speak in sharp reproof  you see ar-
thur i warned you not to show your
hand to any of them she will go direct
to that lawyer

 pardon me my dear differed eliot
 miss rose understands that what has
been said here was strictly confidential
 yes replied nan  i give you my
word mr eliot

  her red head was proudly erect as she
opened the door but in the hall with
the door closed behind her she was saved
from an outburst of grief and despair
only by the sight of the proprietress glid-
ing softly away toward the stairs nan
turned her back on the woman and stood
with her hands pressed hard on her bosom
to restrain the sobs that seemed deter-
mined to force their way into her throat

  as she began to regain her self-con-
trol she became aware that she was star-
ing at a calendar hung beside the door
each past day of the month had been
crossed off the  th next to be can-
celled started in her mind a swift train
of associated memories that date was
the last one she had marked two months
before on the sick-chart of howard eliot

  the words that she had just spoken to
his son may have recalled her promise to
the father or it may have been her sub-
conscious awareness of that which was in
the bosom of her dress she drew out
the sealed envelope and looked at the
feeble unsteady writing upon the front
even in her dejection she tingled with a
little thrill of satisfaction and triumph
over the writer of those words

  beyond any doubt he had sought to
tempt her feminine curiosity but pan-
dora had not opened the box-and the

sixty days had passed in fact because
of the one day over thirty in july she
could have uncovered the secret the pre-
vious morning

  yet with his explicit instructions and
the calendar before her eyes she stood
hesitating her exultance suddenly turned
into an agony of suspense

  what was inside the envelope did
her pandora box fiold a malicious imp or
a light elf would she find inside a
small gift to prove his carefully masked
gratitude for her good service or would
it be only a bitter jest to mock her for
refusing his incredible preposterous offer
of marriage and fortune

  her small fingers quivering with agita-
tion drew a brass pin from the coils of
her vivid hair and after two or three at-
tempts slit open the top of the envelope
still more tremulously she replaced the
hairpin and fumbled until she had pulled
out and opened the sheet of paper folded
within that which was written on the
sheet of paper was as brief as it was
astounding to the girl-

  i will all my property to my nurse nan rose

 howard eliot

  the tremulous writing writhed under
nans dilating eyes as if alive her
brain reeled from the effort to compre-
hend this incredible thing twelve
words and the date-that was all yet
it purported to bestow upon her nan
rose the pauper a fortune

  after the girls first shock of utter
amazement came horror and then a wave
of righteous wrath this subsided into
profound pity and indignation

  she bent over the writing her broad
little forehead puckered with the effort
of hard thinking suddenly her body
straightened she looked up her eyes
bright and resolute and her lips half
parted in an eager smile

  her abrupt opening of the door sur-
prised eliot in the midst of a heated pro-
test  -woman of breeding verna-a
lady otherwise we must wait until we
do find one
his temporary wife



   excuse me murmured nan she
met their questioning stares and stopped
short beside the closed door her face
averted and her gaze on the floor  ive
come back i-i changed my mmd

   what you mean you agree que-
ried eliot

  he came striding to her unmistakably
relieved and pleased miss dc ore drew
the thick veil down over her flushed face

   you will sign an agreement-a con-
tract she demanded

   yes answered nan with sudden ici-
ness

   but the compensation miss rose
remarked eliot

  nan murmured the word in a vague
tone as if her thoughts were elsewhere
 compensation

   for your part in the-undertaking
he explained  would five thousand dol-
lars be satisfactory to you

   five thousand- oh yes whatever
you wish

  her indifference puzzled him and
roused the suspicions of miss devore
she whispered in his ear but he met
the insinuation with the same obstinate
quixotic chivalry that had caused him to
refuse to consider the charges against
herself made by his father

   i am positive my dear that miss
rose can be trusted - that she has no
thought other than to carry through the
arrangement as agreed upon

   i will do exactly what you wish
promised nan

  even miss devore could detect no
guile in the direct resolute gaze of the
girls gray eyes

   good said eliot he took out his
check-book and a fountain pen  i will
write a check for five thousand dollars in
your favor as mrs arthur eliot you
will cash it as soon as we are married and
you haw told judge laton you are my
wife

   must i-go and-and tell him fal-
tered i tan

    we consider it necessary replied the
young man  he is sole executor of the

     	a-s

will unless he is convinced of the mar-
riage he can prevent the estate from
coming to me

  nan looked down at her little -ringless
hands  that would be most unjust 
she murmured

   he must do what the will directs
explained eliot u i cannot blame him
while as for my father-you know how it
was with him por old dad they say
no one dies a christian death whose dis-
ease is located below the diaphram he
suffered so damnably fact is i cant
believe he was responsible for all this
anyway im certain he wished to change
his will-there at the last-else id not
have resorted to this miserable subter-
fuge

   suffering makes angels of some peo-
ple- began nan

   and fiends of others miss devore
broke in

    oh no not that  differed nan  it
only makes them as mr eliot says not
responsible

  for the first time the young mans lips
quirked up at the corner in their fasci-
nating crooked anile the girls eyelids
quivered and sank and she drew in a deep
breath

    that settles it he said

  he wrote a check and handed it to her
she thrust it into her bosom without look-
ing at the amount or the names again
he smiled his appreciation

   will an immediate marriage be agree-
able he asked

   the sooner the better replied nan

   she has yet to sign the agreement
arthur miss devore reminded him

  he took a typewritten sheet of paper
from an inner pocket unfolded it and
reached a match from the oid-fashioned
safe of the bracket lamp beside the door

   arthur - wait  shrilled the veiled
lady  you cannot intend-

  why not he asked miss rose
has my check that safeguards her it
is drawn to her as my wife that safe-
guards me for the rest i have her word
and she has mine


all-story weekly

  the match crackled on the sandpaper
front of the safe as he held it to the
lower corner of the typewritten paper
he remarked with an astuteness that
neither girl would have expected of his
frank artifice-disdaining nature

   the fewer who know of this agree-
ment the better if kept in writing it
might have fallen into the possession of
some one unscrupulous enough to at
tempt blackmailing-or judge laton
might have seen it 

  he waved the flaming paper to save
his fingers a whiff of the acrid smoke
sickened nan owing to her weakened
condition she was already faint from the
close air of the room she swayed dizzily
and put a hand against the door to
steady herself

  his voice came to her as if from across
a field of humming bees  youre ill

   no - no she sought to deny
only a trifle- you see at the hos-
pital we usually had a cup of tea-or
something-midmorning

  she was dimly conscious of supporting
hands after a time she roused to the
fact that she was reclining on asofa
before an opened window miss devore
was energetically fanning into her face
the warm but fresh air that flowed in
over the window-sill the veil that con-
cealed the ladys expression caused nans
gaze to shift

  the window was ornamented with an
outcurving grille of copper through the
screen that was stretched over the grille
nan looked out into the grateful dark-
green of a big tree her gaze returned
to the room and for the first time she
had attention to spare for its quiet
charm it was a big old-fashioned bed-
chamber- decorated in restful tones and
furnished with quaint antique pieces
with the exception of the comfortable
modern brass bed

  a pleasant jingle attracted her glance
to the opening door eliot stepped in
and took a tray from a jap who remained
outside as nan drew herself up to a
sitting position he closed the door and

came across to her on the tray were
sugar cream a small pot of cocoa and
a plate of wafers nan lowered her dark
lashes to hide the ravenous look in her
eyes

   wont you and miss devore join
me she forced herself to murmur

   if youll excuse us i wish to speak
with miss devore about the arrange-
ments he replied

  whether or not the act was planned
out of consideration for nan his taking
of miss devore from the room permitted
the hungry girl to eat without restraint
when they returned every dish on the
tray was empty the few cubes of
sugar that nan had not dissolved in her
cocoa were in the pocket of her dress
she was not particularly fond of sweets
but she knew that sugar is one of the
most sustaining of foods and she needed
strength to endure the ordeal of her
temporary marriage

  to divert attention from the empty
tray she remarked her opinion of the
room  this is so quiet and restful do
you know i believe i shall come here
for a weeks vacation while planning my
college course

   good idea approved eliot  you
may consider the charges rather high but
it seems to be a very desirable place for
one who wishes rest and quiet glad to
hear you intend to go to college youll
like it

  miss devore somewhat impatiently
held out a large dark veil and an auto-
mobile wrap of rich-appearing silk

   oh yes said- eliot  miss rose
may i ask you kindly to wear these
its necessary for you to look the part in
your dress as well as-as yourself espe-
cially before laton

 he held the wrap for nan with a
genial courteousness that caused miss
devore to tap the floor with the toe of
her stylish pump nan slipped into the
wrap and took the veil to the mirror

  when she turned about only an ob-
servant woman would have noticed any-
thing lacking in the fashionableness of
his temporary wife



her costume the wrap extended an
undue distance below the hem of the
skirt but it covered over the cheapness
of her dress the veil converted her
home-made hat into a creation and con-
cealed her red hair

chapter xi

law and evidence

there was no one to observe the
three until they came down-stairs
and out on the rustic porch de-
vore was waiting beside the limousine
at sight of him nans flushed face paled
and she coldly placed herself on the far
side of miss devore eliot noticed her
look and frowned inquiringly at devore

   no call to murder me old man
complained the mutely accused  met
miss rose on the street she looked so
pegged i made the mistake of offering
her a loan bally blunder - but well
meant forgot id never been formally
-er-presented to the lady over the
pond yknow the roof is considered an
introduction

   lennie always means well inter-
posed miss devore she turned frigidly
to nan  miss rose i present my
brother it is necessary for he is to be
one of your witnesses

  devore doffed his cap opened the door
of the limousine and stepped aside with
self-effacing deference while eliot handed
in the girls the two men then took the
front seats and eliot drove the car to-
wards the heart of the city

  throughout the trip devore chatted
garrulously to his companion behind
them nan and miss devore sat silent
and as far apart from one another as
the width of the limousine would permit
when the party entered the city hall
the witnesses waited in the corridor
while eliot and nan secured the mar-
riage license they were soon in pos-
session of the required legal permission
for arthur howard eliot age twenty-
three years and annabelle randolph

rose age twenty years to marry one
another

  at the door of the justices courtroom
eliot as too often happens with bride-
grooms found that he had forgotten to
provide a ring

   but is one necessary - for us
questioned nan all on edge from the
frightful mental strain that she was
forcing herself to endure with outward
composure	

   that fat old attorney will look for
it replied miss devore irritably as she
stripped off a glove to remove the
smallest and least expensive of her rings

  nan interposed with frigid decisive-
ness  do not trouble it is too large
and i prefer a plain gold band

  eliot shrugged he was enjoying the
situation no more than nan and miss
devore

   my fault well have to go to a
jewelers

  they returned to the limousine and
he drove to a jewelry store a clerk
brought out rings- of various sizes from
which nan selected a broad band that
fitted snuggly on her small finger with
her hand restored to its usual plump-
ness the ring would have been difficult to
remove

  within a few minutes they were back
at the door of the justice eliot looked
at nan with sudden embarrassed diffi-
dence in his dark eyes

  you are still willing to-go through
with it he asked

  she rallied her faltering courage and
nodded her assent he bowed her into
the drab little courtroom with grave
courtesy miss devore followed at
nans shoulder the justice was leaving
his bench for the noon recess devore
unobtrusively slipped around the out-
drifting throng of spectators and spoke
in the ear of the justice

  a minute or so later nan found her-
self in a dingy office back of the court-
room with her three companions the
elderly justice of the peace and his rat-
faced young clerk


all-story weekly

  the justice was pursy and bald and
good-natured given a cassock he
might have posed for a friar tuck the
suggestion brought nan a touch of di-
version and relief from her stress she
realized that she was at least being
spared the mockery of a ministerial wed-
ding she had escaped what she felt
would have been a religious travesty
and this fusty ceremony would be no
less binding that was the one es-
sential-a legal marriage

  eliot stood beside her very grave and
uneasy-eyed though his mouth was al-
most grimly determined but that is
the way with many bridegrooms she
was deathly pale and her eyes looked
past the justice in a wide gaze that saw
nothing-after the manner of many
brides eliot gave his response in a
husky undertone when the question
was put to nan she answered with dis-
concerting clearness

  she felt her bridegrooms involuntary
start and saw the twinkle in the
humorous eyes of the justice a flood
of scarlet surged into her cheeks her
eyes sank to the worn linoleum at her
feet and she did not stir until eliot had
slipped the ring on her finger and the
justice had pronounced them husband
and wife then very quickly she
jerked the thick double veil down over
her face

  there followed a seemingly intermin-
able delay while entry was being made
of the marriage and a certificate filled
out at last his voice-the voice of her
husband-murmured apolgetically in her
ear

   didnt think it would be so hard
but youre plucky-only laton now

  she could have screamed when he
took her arm but no one saw her ex-
pression for her face was now veiled as
completely as miss devores neither
the justice nor the clerk had noticed
anything unusual about the party aside
from their appearance of affluence and
a degree of emotional stress natural to
the occasion

  from the city hall eliot drove to the
building in which judge laton had his
offices there was no discussion ovc
the method of procedure devore and
miss devore remained in the limousine
while eliot silently handed out nan and
escorted her into the building

  she observed how his eyes steadied
and his mouth became more resolute as
they shot up the elevator toward the
offices of the lawyer it pleased her to
see his uneasy concern over herself turn
to grim preparedness for the meeting
with judge laton the scheme was on
the verge of its crisis and he was going
to face the lawyer like a man

  they found the anteroom and front
offices empty the stenographer and
clerks were out at lunch eliot tried the
door of the private office it was un-
locked he walked in without knocking

  judge laton sat with his portly body
sprawled back in his desk chair his fac
head hung forward with its heavy jowl
puffed down upon his chest his face
and neck were brick red and he was
gasping and gurgling as if half choked

  nan clutched at eliots arm and then
darted forward the big lawyer ap-
peared to have suffered some kind of
apoplectic stroke but at the first touch
cf the girls fingers on his bulging cheek
he uttered a sound not unlike the snort
of a startled horse and straightened up
in his chair to dart a piercing glance at
the intruders at once his little whitish
pig eyes began to twinkle and the smile-
wrinkles at their outer corners puckered

   huh-umm caught me napping
eh he boomed- this hot weather a
siesta fs preferable to a lunch-for a
man of my weight

  the remark gave eliot time to step
forward and place a chair for nan al-
most at the lawyers elbow as she
gratefully sank down upon the seat he
stood over her and fired his bomb

   judge i wish to introduce you to
my wife

  the lawyer sat perfectly still his
every feature immobile except the rest-
his temporary wife



less eyes they flashed their glances in
rapid succession up and down the veiled
lady and the young man then with a
deep puff the lawyer heaved himself to
his feet and bowed gravely to nan

   my compliments to mrs arthur
eliot he rumbled with a barely per-
ceptible hint of incredulity in his voice
and glance

  eliot set his jaw and handed over the
marriage license and certificate judge
laton glanced at them pursed his lips
and sat down to read almost instantly
his face again became immobile he
shot a roving glance at nan

   rose - so - annabelle randolph
rose have i not had the honor of
meeting you before mrs eliot

  nan lifted her left hand in a gesture
that displayed her wedding ring while
she drew up her veil as she met his
momentarily fixed gaze she thought she
saw in the little eyes a twinkle that was
both shrewd and humorous eliot
noticed only the continued immobility
of the lawyers gross face he muttered
half apologetically

   during my fathers last days miss
rose-that was-eased his suffering by
her kind and efficient nursing

  a bland smile wreathed about the big
fat face one of the pudgy hands
thumped approval upon the desk

   spoken like the son of your father
-and still better done you have
broken with the lady whom he disproved
and shown your appreciation of the
lady who gained his affection

   oh no-i- faltered nan  surely
he-

  a slow flush reddened eliots face

   i have come to you on a matter of
business judge laton you now have
the proof that i have married another
than my-than miss verna devore as
i understand your interpretation of the
will i am now entitled to - my prop-
erty

  the smile lingered about the lawyers
eyes as he pondered the point with the
wariness of an old counsellor

   now entitled yes that i believe
is the deduction to be drawn from your
compliance with the fundamental condi-
tion but one should be precise in such
matters that memorandum of the
terms-let us see

  he bent over to open a drawer in the
side of his desk next to nan she drew
her feet farther back under her chair
but his down-stooped head brought his
restless glance in under the hem of the
silk automobile wrap after turning
over the papers in the drawer he straight-
ened up puffing and very red of face

   the memorandum appears to have
been mislaid he rumbled his glance
flickering at and around the young
couple  as you may remember the
terms of the will are somewhat involved
however i will make every effort to
render you a precise statement of your
present status at an early date mean-
time if you require a few thousands for
the-hum-honeymoon trip-

  his glance darted into nans whiten-
ing face before she could drop her veil
the flush that lingered in eliots cheeks
deepened

   thanks no he declined  are
you fully satisfied that our marriage is
legal

   this license and certificate have
every appearance of being incontroverti-
ble the lawyer evaded a direct answer
 with the permission of yourself and
mrs eliot i shall keep them as so to
speak vouchers or if you prefer i
will secure a duplicate certificate of the
marriage and a certified excerpt from
the license record

   you are welcome to keep these and
now if you will pardon us we will take
our leave

  judge laton rose even more briskly
than nan as he bowed to her his bull
voice mellowed to sonorous gentleness

   madam in colloquial parlance i am
the eliot family lawyer you are now
the daughter-in-law of my late client
and friend howard eliot both as ex-
ecutor of his will and as the family


all-story weekly

counsellor i wish to place my services
at your disposal i shall feel honored
to have you consult me if at any time
you feel inclined to ask my legal or
friendly advice

   you are-very-very kind to say
it murmured nan

  for several moments after eliot led
her out the old lawyer continued to
stand beside his desk his glance flicker-
ing about and under the chair in which
she had sat when the first of his clerks
came hurrying back from lunch he
clapped on his old-fashioned broad-
brimmed panama and went out

chapter xii

a check on a check

about the same time that the
lawyer left his offices a limousine
with drawn curtains stopped at the
curb of a quiet side street half a block
short of one of the main business thor-
oughfares eliot swung from the front
of the limousine to open the door for
nan

  when the girl stepped out her cheap
dress and home-trimmed hat were no
longer covered by the disguising veil
and wrap her face was very white
and drawn eliot flushed as he lifted his
cap

   may i thank you for the great serv-
ice that you have rendered me he mur-
mured somewhat awkwardly  i did
not realize how hard it would be for
you really id like to double the
amount of that check

  oh no no exclaimed nan and
she abruptly started to leave so that he
might not see the look in her eyes

   the other way he said  my
bank is at the corner you must be
identified ill ask mr devore to-
no refused nan i dont want
-ill not have him go with me

   but you must have some one ill
go myself verna if youll hand out the
veil and wrap

  instead of the articles miss devore
thrust out her head she looked dis-
dainfully at nan

   you cannot go in with her arthur
theres been quite enough publicity
without that

  nan flared  i quite agree with you
good day mr eliot

  he started towards her as she hurried
off  wait ill take the check in my-
self-cash it for you and-

  but nan was already several yards
away and too angry to realize what he
meant as she did not look around she
was unaware that he was following the
side entrance of a department store of-
fered her escape from the detested gaze
of miss devore she darted through

  for several moments eliot was blocked
st the door by the outsurge of a party of
women shoppers when he entered
nan had disappeared between the
many elevators and the aisles crowded
with shoppers the chance of finding so
small a girl was infinitesimal eliot
frowned shrugged and turned back

  five minutes later nan left the front
entrance of the store and peeped around
the corner the limousine was gone
she stepped back before the store win-
dow and pretended to be looking at the
articles on display while she sought to
regain her composure

  if only he had been cold and business-
like but he had shown himself so kind
and concerned for her and so boyishly
embarrassed as if he really considered
her an equal-as a lady who was break-
ing the conventions to do him a service
yet she had taken his pay

  a hot blush burned her cheeks the
only persons near had just passed she
drew from the bosom of her dress the
check that he had thrust upon her
the sight of it gave added poignancy to
her realization of the situation

  pay to mrs arthur h eliot five thousand
dollars

  she was mrs arthur h eliot - she
was his legal wife there was his wed-
his temporary wife



ding ring on one of the quivering fingers
that held his check what a mockery

  the check crumpled in her clenching
hand she flung it down and stamped
her foot upon it the blow burst open
one of the cracks in the upper of the
worn little shoe at sight of the break
the angry color ebbed from her face
she bent over and snatched up the bit
of soiled paper very carefully she
wiped it with her handkerchief

  i cant help it she murmured to
the disconcertment of a dignified matron
who was turning in beside her to look
at the latest model corset  i must use
it and ive paid for it-doubly

  the matron sheered away quite ob-
livious of the startled lady nan folded
the creased soiled check and walked
resolutely around the corner and along
the side block the hurriedness of her
pace together with the heat of the early
afternoon sun and the stress and excite-
ment through which she had passed
brought her to the bank rather feverish
and by no means as clear-headed as
usual

  she thrust the check in at the paying-
tellers window he stared at it a per-
ceptible moment glanced at its back
and pushed it out to her with veiled
inquiry in his non-commital eyes

   you must endorse the check madam
-write your name onthe back

  oh of course how stupid of me
exclaimed nan ashamed and a bit flur-
ried over her forgetfulness

  as sh turned to the nearest desk the
teller made a sign to a lank narrow-
eyed man who stood lounging against a
pillar the man drifted up behind nan
when she hastened back to the window
the teller looked again at the face of
the check then at the back

   excuse me madam he said
 this check is to mrs arthur h eliot
but you have endorsed it  nan r
rose 

  nans confusion and blush of shame
were indistinguishable from the symptoms
of guilt

   but-but do  have to sign it that
way she faltered  i would much
rather use my own-that is my unmar-
ried name

   unless indorsed by her to you i can-
not pay you this check in mrs eliots
favor replied the cashier

  the girls vexation at her blunder
turned to irritation against him for his
obtuseness she held up her hand with
the wedding-ring

   if necessary i will of course indorse
it as you wish i am mrs eliot

  the narrow-eyed mstn gave the teller a
significant look over her head the teller
smiled apologetically

   may i ask you to get the check
initialed by the cashier he is personally
acquainted with mr eliot mr grayson
here will show you to the cashiers office
annoyed but quite unsuspicious nan
looked around at the narrow-eyed man
and acknowledged with a slight bow the
touch he gave his hat when they came
to the door of the cashiers office he
opened it for her and followed her in
the cashier caught graysons look and
coldly motioned nan to a seat

   what can i do for you miss he
asked in a guarded tone

   i am mrs arthur eliot replied
nan and she handed him the check
 because i indorsed this with my own-
that is my unmarried name the teller
told me to have you do something to it
i forget just what

   probably for me to initial it-indi-
cate that i consider it all right ex-
plained the cashier

  his trained glance looked first at
eliots signature and then at nans in-
dorsement the crinkled and soiled con-
dition of the check seemed to him to offer
the right clue

   do you consider it honest to cash a
check that some one has lost he que-
ried

  nan flushed with indignation  i told
you i am mrs eliot give me a pen and
i will sign my married name

  the cashier exchanged a glance with


all-story weekly

grayson and handed his pen to nan
without the slightest trace of hesitancy
she wrote  mrs arthur h eliot  above
her maiden name

   there she said  now give me my
money

  she thrust the check back at the cash-
ier he took it and looked at her with
keen scrutiny behind his tactfully polite
smile

   if you will pardon me madam i am
personally acquainted with mr eliot and
i had reason to believe that his fiancee
was another lady than yourself i have
yet to receive a wedding announce-
ment-

   we were married this noon very un-
expectedly said nan

   indeed questioned the cashier his
eyes taking in again the girls hat and
dress and shoes  pardon me but may
i ask why if you have been a bride only
these few hours mr eliot did not come
to the bank with you

  nan crimsoned and flared  because
i would not let him besides there ought
to be no need ive cashed checks here
before-when i was at the hospital

   ah murmured the cashier his eye-
brows arching there had been gossip at
the club about young eliots father and a
little red-headed nurse here was a prob-
able explanation of the check the girl
held something against either father or
son and had blackmailed the latter into
marrying her

  the astute official temporized  my
dear madam i of course do not doubt
what you say but we have certain bank
rules may i ask if the superintendent
of your hospital can identify you - i
mean as mrs arthur eliot

   i wouldnt accept the slightest favor
from him if he could give it flashed
nan

   but i regret to say madam it is an
inflexible rule-we cannot cash this check
until you are identified as mrs eliot
shall i call up mr eliots residence

   no  forbade the girl she thought a
moment  would mr-i mean judge

laton do he knows all about it he
has the license

  the cashier bowed and took up his tele-
phone to call judge latons office at
the answer he hung up and looked doubt-
fully at nan

   judge laton is not in

  oh dear she exclaimed but i
must have my money-at least some of
it-at once your bank will close soon
and then i- she bit her lip  i dont
care-i must have it please call up mr
eliot

  at this request the grimly waiting de-
tective stared in blank perplexity the
cashier promptly called up the eliot man-
sion the footman caretaker answered
that mr eliot had given all the other ser-
vants a vacation on pay and was still
occupying his apartment at the ritz-
carlton a call for eliot at the hotel
brought the information that he had not
yet returned from a mornings motor
drive with miss devore and her brother

  the cashier and detective exchanged
glances nan was looking down at the
worn tips of her shoes there was no
place in all the city where she could go
except back to her miserable lodging and
she doubted whether she could walk so
far she was faint with the emotional
reaction from her marriage and the visit
to judge laton her parting with eliot
and now this cruel delay

   if you please she asked  may i
stay here until you reach judge laton or
mr eliot on the phone

  certainly madam by all means
consented the cashier and he cast a look
of relief at the detective  the vice-
president is out for the afternoon mr
grayson will show you into his office
where you can rest while i endeavor to
locate-

  he did not finish the sentence nan
had risen only to totter and sway she
would have fallen heavily had not the
alert detective clutched her lax body as
she sagged down

  out for the count he muttered
 good chance to frisk her sir
bread upon the waters



   no ordered the cashier  there is
no question as to eliots signature and
the girl is not dishonest-though she may
be mentally irresponsible put her on
mr miless divan and have miss mckay
attend to her-call a doctor if necessary

i will ask that judge laton and mr eliot
call me up as soon as they return

  he took up his telephone as grayson
went out at the side door carrying the
limp pitiful little figure of the swooning
girl

to be continued next week dont forget thi magazine it issued weekly and that
you will get the continuation of this story without waiting a month

of course at the finish i was sorry
for both of them but on the whole
i was sorriest for jim beckwith-
backing his belief cost him money but
i am sorry for take-a-chance castle
too because its only a question of time
when that theory of his is going to cost
him money too and more than that a
lot of faith in human nature the excep-
tional kind of human nature not the rule

  take-a-chance castle-his right name
is senator ebert l castle-is one of
those men who say  i never argue and
then goes ahead to convince you of some-
thing you dont believe and dont want
to believe with the eloquence of a silver-
tongued legal light trying a case before
a jury of missouri farmers

  that man had a theory on everything
the war the ponies politics and poker
but the theory that was dearest to his
heart was that its always safe to take a
chance on any member of the human
species

   i dont play the market he used
to say  i dont play the ponies and i
dont play poker-not much that is and
my true friends tell me that not much
is too much-but i do play people i
play em to win for place for show-
right across the board just let me get
a good look at a man thats all i ask
and ill place a bet

  oh take-a-chance castle had an ad-
vanced case of optimania all right and
there didnt seem to be any cure for him


all-story weekly

and that was strange too because his
two best friends-castle had a string of
friends that stretched from bar harbor
to the barbary coast in frisco-were
keith kenlon owner of the chicago star
and jim beckwith president of one of
the largest detective agencies in the
country

  of course what these two didnt know
about human nature-the seamy side-
wasnt worth knowing and they sure did
do their best to pass the results of their
knowledge and experience along to take-
a-chance castle

  but their success was not conspicuous
it was something of a joke with beck-
with because he felt that all he had to
do was to sit tight and wait for some
sweet soul to land castle and hed have
the pleasure of drawing his tried and
trusty  i told you so

  in fact he was so sure about this that
he had a standing twenty-to-one bet with
castle on the subject but his friends
failing used to worry kenlon kenlon
was the worrying kind anyhow and then
besides he more than liked castle he
was fond of him

  jim picked up chance-thats what
his name was shortened up to-one night
toward the middle of september in the
hotel breville chicago chance was
wooing the breeze that was drifting shyly
off the lake and dividing his attention
between a tall frosty glass at his elbow
and a pair of noisy socks that he had
lifted to the window-sill for a better view

  chance hailed jim with delight and
after trying to cool him off with a couple
of the same launched into an enthusi-
astic account of his latest  bread upon
the waters  venture as he always called
his experiences in the so-called proof of
his theory when his mood was high jim
however was in a glum frame of mind
and declined to be interested or even as
was usual with him amused with a recital
of chances optimistic adventures 

   go to it chance he remarked sar-
donically at the finish  im a good
waiter and i know its only a question

of time before-have you heard the song
they are singing over at the liberty

    you can play it once

   and sometimes twice

    but the third time youll get yours

   he turned and wagged an impressive
finger

    and all i hope and pray is that
keith kenlon and i are occupying seats
close to the ring-side when the event
comes off

   maybe the heat was oppressing chance
too anyhow he didnt take this with
his accustomed good humor

    huh he snorted  dont you love
to howl calamity-you and kenlon
too i dont blame you so much jim
you make your living digging up the mis-
takes in this world and dragging them
up to the bar of justice of course its
not to your interest to admit much good
in the world nor the people in it but
kenlon ought to have had his lesson

    dont get you beckwith said

    no you wouldnt its all in a days
work to you but i thought it struck
deeper with kenlon being it hit him so
close to home you know who i mean
-jack kenlon if kenlon had been
willing to take a chance in his own son
you and he wouldnt have spent the
greater part of a year chasing over three
continents-and at that it didnt do
either of you a bit of good you didnt
find the boy and you didnt learn a thing
from it

    what was there to learn jim want-
ed to know  kenlons boy sowed some
heavy crop of wild oats and-

    how do you know they were so wild
why couldnt kenlon have given him
a chance to explain castle interrupted
as always ready to argue at the drop of
the hat

   jim recognized the familiar symptoms
and waved his hand wearily

    oh let it go at that he begged
 its too hot for one of your fights to
a finish he rose and felt his wilted
collar gingerly  im going over to the
bread upon

the waters



club and see if the tank will cool me off
want to come

  castle shook his head and managed a
grin when jim called back warningly

   dont take any wooden money while
im gone

  once alone castle found himself ex-
ceedingly bored he had scant use for
his own society at all times and to-night
he felt rather injured jim beckwith had
started an argument an argument he
would have fully enjoyed and then gone
off without giving his friend a run for
his money castle twisted about in his
chair with the vague notion of going to
hunt up somebody as he turned some
one touched him on the shoulder

   pardon me a smooth voice said just
at his elbow  would you mind moving
your chair a bit i want to use this
desk

  chance rose at once and dragged his
chair around and as he did so the man
behind him paused in the act of reaching
for a pen to look at him closely

   isnt this senator castle he asked
after a second

  chance admitted his identity and be-
gan searching about in his mind trying
to locate something familiar about the
man he was tall light and distin-
guished-looking with iron-gray hair and
a pair of keen eyes to match he was
a man castle felt he should have remem-
bered

   you dont remember me i see the
other suggested smiling  my name is
minton i met you in san francisco a
year ago he paused and his smile
broadened  im a friend of jim beck-
with

  chance beamed and held out his ready
hand

   yes yes indeed he said  glad
to meet you again mr minton dont
place just where we met at the moment
but any friend of jim beckwith- and
he finished with an eloquent gesture

   we met at a falcon club dinner
the other went on to explain he had
evidently abandoned all idea of attending

to his correspondence because he rose and
joined chance in the other broad chair
that faced the street

   sure-ill place you and all about
you in a minute castle promised if
he didnt hed ask castle rescued from
a lonely evening had now brightened to
his usual form  are you from frisco
mr minton he went on  is it your
home i mean you know how it is meet-
ing a man from home on this side of the
rockies

  minton said he knew how it was per-
fectly and went on to give frisco as his
birthplace and quite a few facts concern-
ing his residence there of course castle
knew half the town and those he didnt
know personally he knew people who did
so in less than no time he and minton
were hard at it they went back as far
as the fire and then from there to the
huge fortunes that had been made since
that disaster the politics that had helped
or hindered those fortunes and the news
of the town in general finally minton
rose

   i always drift down to the cafe for
a nightcap about this hour he said
 how about you joining me

  chance accepted with alacrity and
soon the two were seated at a small table
in a corner of the cafe the hour was
late and the place was almost empty in
fact except for a young chap in evening
clothes who sat at the next table the
place was practically deserted

  they gave their order and as the
waiter was turning away the boy at the
next table called him sharply

  the waiter stopped and both men
looked over after a casual glance min-
ton went on with his conversation but
chance who always takes more than a
passing interest in every soul he lays eyes
on continued to look

  after a minute or so he leaned over
and touched minton on the arm  take
a look at that boy he said he looks
like the end of a misspent life and no
mistake 

  minton was plainly surprised by


all-story weekly

chances interest he interrupted him-
self in his story and glanced over his
shoulder

   does look rather seedy he agreed
with no special interest and went back
to what he was saying

  but chances interest somehow seemed
to stick to the boy at the next table

   ive got boys of my own about his
age he said to explain his scrutiny
 anyhow i always take notice of young
folks

  minton nodded with what he evidently
tried to make polite understanding but
couldnt seem to work up much interest
ir their neighbor he was on the cali-
fornians bugaboo a possible japanese
invasion and was entirely wrapped up in
his subject

  when the waiter appeared with their
order he brought the boys at the same
time minton cut short his monologue
and gave his entire attention to his
brandy holding it up to the light and
then carefully measuring it into his tall
glass he took some time about this
and while he waited chances eyes trav-
eled back to the next table

  the boy was slouched down in his chair
staring stupidly at the glass before him
in a moment he roused himself and be-
gan to go carefully through all of his
pockets finally he brought out a small
bottle and after tapping it on the edge of
the table he emptied it into his glass

   idiot  minton exclaimed suddenly
pounding irritably on the table  i dis-
tinctly ordered soda and look what hes
brought me wheres that fool waiter

  he pushed the carbonic siphon violent-
ly aside and twisted about in his chair

  but the waiter after the manner of
his kind had vanished from view and
so with a muttered apology minton
reached across to the next table and
helped himself to the soda siphon that
stood there as he did so his cuff caught
on the boys glass and it went crashing
to the floor

n the boy jumped to his feet  say
he demanded angrily  what do you

think youre doing-what do you mean
by reaching across my table like that
anyhow look what youve done

  well of course minton was sorry and
said so but it was an accident that might
have happened to anybody and he and
chance were both utterly surprised when
the boy angrily waved aside all explana-
tions and after raving for a moment with
a violence all out of proportion to the
cause for offense threw a coin down on
the table and tore out of the place

  now what do you know about that
minton asked staring after him

  chance was equally nonplused and
shook his head

   probably been drinking minton
shrugged and then apparently dismissing
the incident from his mind he raised his
glass   heres luck

  chance raised his glass suddenly over
the rim he noticed that the small bottle
was still lying on the other table he
tilted back in his chair and picked it up

   while you were mixing your high-
ball he explained to minton  that kid
dropped some powder from this bottle
into his glass i wonder what was in it

  minton took the bottle in his hand
there was no label on it so he sniffed
gingerly at the few grains of powder that
still remained on the bottom  know
anything about drugs he asked curi-
ously

   not a thing

  minton put the bottle back on the
table and smiled a bit sheepishly

   of course it would never have en-
tered my head if you hadnt called my
attention to how seedy this chap looked
this in all probability is some medicine
he was taking but still he laughed a
little nervously  im a fool i know
but i once saw a chap in hong-kong-
an attache of the french legation-com-
mit suicide under similar circumstances
and it made a lasting impression on my
mind

   good lord i should think it might
chance said

  minton seemed anxious to throw off
bread upon the waters



the disagreeable remembrance and ab-
ruptly switched to an irrelevant topic
but chance couldnt seem to listen to
him he just couldnt get his mind off
that - boy-his appearance his manner
and finally his outburst over what ap-
peared such a trifling occurrence sud-
denly he rose to his feet

    call me any kind of a fool you like
minton he said  but that boys got
me i simply cant sit here and let him go
out to i dont know what i have a feel-
ing about these things intuition a hunch
or something and ive got to find him

   minton thought he was crazy he told
him that he was and that he was over-
playing his impression but he couldnt
influence chance any he threw off his
hand and hurried to the door and looked
up and down the street then he turned
and beckoned excitedly about a block
away he had recognized the tall young
figure standing in the light from a drug-
store castle started off down the street
with the still objecting minton at his
heels

  when chance touched the boys arm
he whirled around as if he had been shot

 then he recognized the two men and a
black scowl spread over his face

   but it didnt stop chance

   whats the matter with you my
friend he asked with his big smile still
keeping his hand on the young chaps
arm

    is that your affair or mine the boy
snapped jerking his arm away

    on the face of it its yours chance
conceded  but im sort of making it
mine its a way i have i can see youre
in wrong somewhere and as ive got boys
of myown id like to help-if youll let
me

    well i wont and the boy closed
matters by turning back to the drug-store
window

  wont you give me a chance
chance persisted

    say youre a regular good samaritan
arent you the boy sneered

   this brought minton into the game

   thats a fine way to talk when a man
offers to help you he said

  but the boy only scowled at him and
made no reply chance seemed rather at
a loss

   oh come on back minton urged in
disgust  you cant do anything hes
either drunk or hes a dope fiend or-
the boy swung round savagely

   dope-fiend a fine chance for a dope
fiend in this town why you cant get
enough dope here to pass out with you
spoiled the last chance i had

  chance was horrified and even minton
seemed a bit shaken and made no fur-
ther objection when chance determinedly
passed his hand through the boys arm
and turned him round toward the hotel
at first the boy hung back he was sullen
and he was ugly but chance is some per-
suader and in the end he had his way
once back in the cafe he got a stiff high-
ball into the boy and soon had him talk-
ing

  as the boy said there was nothing newt
in his tale but it had its points at that

   im from the coast he said- from
san francisco and of course at this
both his listeners sat upright  my
name is harris whitmore i suppose you
know my dad i g whitmore every-
body does ill cut this as short as i can
god knows its not pleasant telling well
about three years ago i got into a scrape
with a woman it was in all the news-
papers and that finished me with dad
he shut down the brakes and i drifted
east i finally managed to get a position
here and i honestly think i was making
good i married a girl i met here and
have a boy a year old

  go on both men urged as he
paused

   a week ago the woman from frisco
turned up she was on her way to south
america she put a big price on her
going away without telling what she knew
about me and i couldnt raise it-not all
of it her silence meant my wife my
boys name my position - everything
i-i didnt know what to do


all-story weekly

   why didnt you wire your father
minton suggested

   he wouldnt have believed me hes
taken too many chances on me

  there you have it chance burst
cut  good lord if we wont take a
chance on our own where do we aim to
get off anyhow

  the boy shrugged and gulped the re-
mainder of his whisky

   well i got the money i helped my-
self to what i had to have-five hundred
dollars out of the firms cash drawer i
cant keep it dark after to-morrow-and
then the quick finish for me he hid his
face in his hands and his shoulders shook

  minton hadnt seemed much impressed
at the beginning of the boys story but
now he fidgeted about uneasily and as
for chance he was all upset minton
kept looking at him as if to intimate that
their uncomfortable position was undoubt-
edly of his making and it was rather up
to him to do something but chance had
nothing to suggest

   mr castle minton asked slowly
after a thoughtful moment  do you ever
take a chance	-

  chance started as at the mention of an
old friend

  thats my middle name he declared

  minton seemed to search for the exact
words he wanted

   i dont claim to be much of a judge
of people he said presently  but this
boys story sounds straight to me how
about it

   same here

   now im not a rich man minton
went on  and two hundred and fifty
dollars means something to me - but it
means more to this boy it means his
salvation mr castle will you take a
chance

  would he chance had his check-book
out before the other finished speaking
and in less than no time the whole thing
was fixed up the boy could hardly ex-
press his gratitude and chance went to
bed all in a glow of self-glorification

  about ten the next morning while

chance was quietly eating his breakfast
jim beckwith tore into the dining-room
jim began to talk before chance had
much more than a chance to say good
morning

   you had it coming to you he gloat-
ed and then suddenly he became serious
 you know chance he went on to ex-
plain evidently trying to keep the excite-
ment out of his voice  as ive so often
f   
told you this town is a gold-mine for any

one with a quick wit an elastic conscience
and sense enough to go while the going is
good chicago is the crooks paradise

  he leaned over the table and tapped
chances arm

   now theres a pair of crooks ive
chased in and out of about every city in
the union ive never caught up with
them and ive never quite got the goods
on them-until now they didnt stay
long in any one place and the class of
men they get wont make a holler after
they see theyve been handed a gold
brick

   why not

   they dont want to publicly brand
themselves as good things i suppose
jim came to an impressive pause
 chance fate has overtaken you they
got you last night what did it cost
you

  chance protested but when jim went
on and described the whole scene as re-
ported by one of his detectives he had
nothing further to say but he did renig
absolutely and vigorously when jim said
he would have to come across and testify

  he pointed to his nickname almost
tearfully and said hed never hear the
last of it but beckwith wouldnt let him
off and finally wrung a promise from him
that he would meet the detective who
had the pair in charge in half an hour
and do the needful

  now beckwith had rather taken
chance off his feet while he was with him
but once alone he came down to earth
again and got to thinking the whole thing
over the thing he thought about most
was the boy somehow he couldnt
bread upon the waters



bring himself to believe that his much-
vaunted ability to pick people had played
him false he studied the situation from
every angle and the more he studied the
more he hated to do what he had to do

  the upshot of it was that when he
was brought face to face with the boy
he took one look into the white driven
face and then stood up and said hed
never laid eyes on him before then he
turned and made a quick escape the
detective glared after him and got into
communication with beckwith

  once in his own room chance got on
the telephone and tried to reach jim he
was standing with the receiver in his
hand when his door softly opened
chance turned round and nearly dropped
the receiver the boy stood there regard-
ing him with a calm cool smile

  ail of a sudden chances rage mounted

   you young crook he exploded

   calm yourself the boy admonished
him  dont spoil the pretty picture i
have painted in my grateful heart youre
the only man i ever met who could see
farther than his money heres your
check

  the check didnt calm chance much
but after stating his opinion of last nights
doings with excusable profanity he sud-
denly took it upon himself to deliver a
moral lecture he quite fancied himself
in this role and ended by offering to give
the boy a new deal

   any string to that the boy inquired
with interest

   no-that is i should expect you to
testify against minton

  the boy grinned and shook his head

   youll have to excuse me minton
picked me up out of the gutter a few
years back and helped me to make a liv-
ing-such as it is ive decided on the
straight and narrow for myself-you can
put a feather in your cap for that-but i
dont think ill start on my way by giving
minton the double-cross

  chance protested but before he got
fully under way the door flew open and
in rushed jim beckwith he caught
sight of the boy and fell back a step

  the prodigal son he exclaimed

   hello beckwith the boy grinned

  chance looked from one to another in
manifest amazement

   keith kenlons boy jim explained
briefly

  chance turned to stare at the boy and
slowly his glance wavered and drifted
back to beckwith while a beaming smile
overspread his countenance

   take-a-chance castle thats me he
said  ive earned my name and im
proud of it dont you think something
now of my system jim he demanded
 if you do you might come across on
that standing twenty-to-one bet  bread
upon the waters you know be a sport
jim the jokes on you

chapter xii

metamorphosis

desperate as was his predica-
ment and heavily as he knew the
circumstances of his prowling
around back windows on a fire-escape in
fantastic garb would weigh against him
in case of arrest jenkins did not despair

  he had no intention whatever of being
arrested everything now depended on
making good his escape he realized as
he scrambled up the wet and shaking lad-
der pursued by the infamous minions of
the law

  with an agility that absolutely con-
vinced all the rapidly-gathering spectators
a dangerous madman was at liberty-for
who but a maniac could have shown

such activity and strength-jenkins
clambered swiftly to the very top of the
building pursued by the cries jeers
gibes and cat-calls of the populace

  having reached the eaves he hastily
observed the prospect before him pale
sweating and distraught trembling and
with feet already very sore from the sharp
iron rungs of the ladders he peered down
at the dizzy vacancy beneath peopled
by the enemy then up at the far more
dizzy slant of the roof

  in front of him now arose a steep
acclivity of slate several dormer-win-
dows broke this monotonous gray ex-
panse to his left the blank wall of
another building rose about fifteen feet
above the ridge-pole effectually barring
any escape in that direction to his

thi tory began in the all-story weekly for february 


bill jenkins buccaneer



right he saw that the slates ended ab-
ruptly about thirty feet away

   beyond their steep edge several chim-
ney-stacks projected from some other
building evidently lower since jenkins
couldnt possibly descend or stay where
he was-for already a rattling of the fire-
escape told him the sleuths were on his
trail-he made a quick choice of the roof

   pausing only to shake his fist at the
thickening crowd below and to howl
defiantly  go chase yourselves you
rubes he scrambled up over the gutter

   the slates were appallingly steep and
slippery jenkinss hands and feet slid
most alarmingly as he crept up toward
the ridge-pole like a human fly the loss
of his boots till now considered a calam-
 all at once revealed itself as a bless-
ing in disguise for had our hero been
booted he must infallibly have slid off
the edge of the roof and catapulted in a
wide parabolic curve into the alley that
is-our story would have ended right
here and now

    as a get-away this is some warm
jumble jenkins grunted laboring up
the steep acclivity sliding back about
two feet for every three he climbed but
making progress after all  ill give you
mutts a marathon for your coin any-
how

   with a supreme effort he dragged him-
self far enough to lay hold on the ridge-
pole drew himself up straddled it and
began rapidly hunching himself along in
the direction of the chimney-stacks

   the tails of his dress-coat dragged be-
hind him over the slates a chill wetness
began to permeate his trousers a splin-
ter that he encountered pointed the
wrong way brought an agonized  ouch 
to his pale and trembling lips but still
he kept a hunching on on on with truly
commendable concentration on the one
object in view-the end of the roof

   as in a kind of daze he perceived tall
smoking factory-chimneys and far-spread-
ing streets that told him he was in some
considerable town its very name unknown
to him

  up from the alley behind an increased
vociferation indicated that the crowd of
spectators to whom his anguish was but
a subject for sport and jest was moment-
ly increasing but now right in front
of him as he reached the termination of
the slates he perceived a flat tin roof
only about eight feet below he paused
not neither hesitated but leaped with
boldness came down on all fours with a
shock that loosened every vertebra and
most of his teeth got up and ran

  panting he fled over the tin right
in front of him he perceived several small
red structures covering stairways that
led down from the roof

  the hunted hare acquires unusual
speed the deer pursued shows intelli-
gence beyond its norm in covering its
spoor jenkins followed the laws of na-
ture atavism sharpened his wits in-
stead of dodging into and down the first
of these little housings which would have
been the natural thing to do he merely
stopped at it long enough to open the
door and drop his hat inside it

  leaving it open he sped on haggard
wan trembling and wild of eye i sup-
pose a more disreputable ruffian never
existed in this world than our friend
william at this instant hatless and
shoeless with a tight wet dress-suit now
splitting at several seams where his stren-
uous exertions had ripped it with dishev-
eled hair a bruised face and wildly-
glaring eyes-well it was a good thing
sally couldnt see him at that exact
moment

  jenkins was on his way true enough
but he wasnt out of the woods yet the
door of the next housing when he tried
it resisted locked so was the third
only one more remained at the far end
of the tin

  could he reach it in time

  a shout not far below the eaves of
the slate-roofed building told him he
hadnt more than a very few seconds of
race and was this last housing un-
locked if not that would mean run-
ning back to the first one again

	a-s


all-story weekly

   s-s-s-suffering tomcats  gulped the
unhappy wretch flinging himself at the
door of the final structure

  the wind is tempered to the shorn
lamb according to don quixote and
jenkins found the last door unlocked
he beat all worlds records on getting
through doors with the lightning leap he
gave into that blessed shelter

  just as he slid the bolt he heard the
impact of heavy boots on the tin roof
followed by a sound of running feet that
all at once stopped short in spite of
his exhaustion and pain jenkins grinned
to himself battleships to beans the
pursuer had ducked into the blind lead

  stopping not to gloat over having
thrown pursuit off the track even if only
temporarily bill crept in his stockinged
feet down a dusty and crooked flight of
stairs he paused on the first landing
to give ear heard no sounds of peril and
so continued down several more stairways
cumbered with coal-hods mops ash-cans
garbage-pails and other objets dart

  as he went his thoughts worked quick-
ly he perceived that he must not issue
out into the back alley again but must
try to get into the basement there no
doubt he could hide himself in some
coal-bin or behind some furnace until the
hue-and-cry should have subsided

  it seemed to be growing quite a
specialty of his this hiding in holes and
corners somehow or other ever since
he had begun to seek mere justice he had
been cringing in lairs it didnt seem
quite right but this was no time for
analysis jenkins crept down and down
holding breath in trepidation

  the barking yelp of a dog somewhere
within the flats belonging to these back-
stairs the fretful cry of a child the
grumble of a mans voice even the rattle
of dishes set his nerves quivering sup-
pose one of those back doors should just
chance to open and some amazed house-
holder catch a glimpse of him

  gee thought bill soft-footing it
down ever down  this frost makes a
blizzard look like june

  he reached a darker stairway-the last
surely this communicated with the base-
ment joy his hand trembled on the
knob of a door at the bottom the
door opened and jenkins walked through
-into a dingy kitchen

   oi gewalt he heard a thick voice
exclaim  gott im himmel vot iss
dat

  jenkinss startled eye swept up the
scene at a glance he knew he had
blundered into a basement tenement
before him stood a table with a half-
eaten meal thereon at this table sat a
stout red-faced thick-necked little man
with protuberant brown eyes and with
a round black cap on his cranium this
man was now staring at jenkins with an
expression of the most dumfounded sur-
prise jenkins had ever beheld-and our
adventurers experience with surprised
persons as you know had not been
slight

  hello unk said bill forcing a
smile he tried to render casual to his
pale lips  can the astonishments its
all  k both ways from the middle
not too early for biz what

  a somewhat extended acquaintance
with individuals of the type now con-
fronting him made jenkins certain he
was committing no eiror in addressing the
little man as  uncle he closed the
door behind him smiled again and ad-
vanced into the kitchen treading softly
in his wet stockings there are times
and situations when a smile becomes par-
ticularly ghastly  and this was one of
them

  pusiness gasped the stout little
man paling perceptibly not even the
fact that his safe in the little clothing-
shop at the front of the tenement was
locked could quite reconcile him to the
prospect of immediately having his throat
cut by this stocking-footed yegg in a
dripping and unseemly dress-suit  pusi-
ness bolice

  forget that jenkins commanded
sternly coming close to the table and
laying a hand on it
bill jenkins buccaneer



  the little man began to tremble real-
izing that a steel knife lay there what
wouldnt he have given just now to have
been anywhere else

   forget it get flush with yourself
unk and pry off a little of the coin that
good luck is trying to hand you ive
got a real joy-maker of a proposition
for you are you on

   vot you get mine kitchen ouidt
or i calls der bolice yet

   shhhh heres a game that  make
you weep for joy and jenkins bent
confidentially over the table with rapid-
ly returning courage when we are prop-
erly scared nothing will reassure us so
effectually as to meet somebody more
scared than we are  heres something
that will ring the bulls-eye of quick
profits-a deal thats got em all whipped
to a low whisper lamp this suit unk
and jenkins held out his arm so that
the hebrew might observe the superfine
quality of the cloth under the faint light
that seeped in from an air-shaft window
close at hand

   suit

   sure a velvet line of goods if any
was ever basted if you had it you
could breeze into the crib with a wad
j-ou wouldnt need any strong glasses to
count do business

   vot you mean the old gentleman
was now becoming less alarmed and hos-
tile a gleam of human interest had be-
gun to shine in his heavy-lidded eyes
the eloquence of possible dollars and
cents had begun to get its work in
vot iss

   listen said jenkins  this raiment
is a cluster of  k stuff and its yours
for the asking hand me down a street-
suit some kicks and a bean-lid slip
me a few shekels and cop the joyous
harness it never cost less than a hun-
dred unk and as a judge of kippy
cloth you know it say yes 

  the expression of the little mans face
assured bill the proposal was not without
attraction but all was not yet plain
sailing

   vere you get dot the hebrew in-
quired suspiciously  und how comes
it dot you vear it in der morning yet

   oh thats all right unk jenkins
smiled though inwardly his heart was per-
forming gymnastics  i sat in at a little
poker-game last night and got skun to
the raw im busted with a great big
b got to go to schenectady this morn-
ing and-	v

  schenectady ejaculated the little
man staring  oi himmel but dis
iss schenectady yust now

  jenkins stared at him with drooping
jaw then he rallied

   see here unk he explained re-
solved to throw all subterfuge to the
winds and speak the truth the whole
truth and nothing but the truth for
cnce he would try the effect of the plain
facts with no embroidery  spread your
lugs now and ill dope it out straight
last night i was shanghaied ashore here

i dont know just where i am or why
ive only got forty-seven cents my fifty
bucks were snatched from me by a fat
arm in a dirty red kimono i climbed
up the fire-escape blew over the roof
skated down your back stairs and here i
am ready for biz are you on

  a long minute the little hebrew con-
sidered jenkins with pity then shak-
ing his head he sadly inquired

   vot iss der name off der blace you
got ouidt off und how long haf you
been ouidt

   can that retorted jenkins flushing
with anger  im getting sick of being
taken for a nut off the bug-tree thats
what they called me at hamilton asy-
lum thats what the cop said just now
forget it all that matters is this suit
see he struck the table a blow with
his fist hit a saucer half-full of warm
tea and got a shower-bath up his arm

 are you ripe for a hit-bang-and-get-
away deal that will reap you a large wad
of kale or not if so stop rag-chewing
get me

  a certain glint of the little mans eye
seemed to indicate that after all-


all-story weekly

though it were a pity to take advantage
of a lunatic-business was business he
nodded decisively

   all right said he  it makes me
noddings efter all if you are messhiggen
 not i gif you anodder suit hat und
shoes-und zwei tollar

   two beans shouted jenkins aghast
 why you never flashed your shiners on
a finer finish in all your life kick in
with twenty anyhow 

  the little man now quite recovered
from his alarm got up took the lappel
of the coat between his thumb and finger
examined the cloth the lining and but-
tons and nodded again

   tree tollar said he with an air of
finality jenkins knew this was top
price and submitted

   all right go to it he accepted
 but its murder in the first degree if

i	wasnt down to iron and grass youd
never cop it cough the duds and the
three seeds gramp and ill blow

  the hebrew shuffled through a door
into what jenkins could see was a small
dark shop after a minute or two he
returned with a couple of second-hand
suits both of which our hero rejected
his brain was at work on a bold coup

  determined as he was to follow the
victory to square accounts with mal-
colm everett and find out the truth
about sally he felt now that a more
maritime aspect would be essential such
a disguise too would help him slip
through the police drag-net yes he
must have a sailor-suit by all means

   nothing to it unk said he waving
the suits away  i side-step em both
got any mariners togs if so prance
em out

   vot vot you vant demanded the
little man amazed

   sailor-suit ocean ships  a wet
sheet and a flowing sea and a wind that
follows fast get me

   vot der teufel you vant mit such
nonsenses

   never mind unk nev-er mind
sailor-suit for mine

   shaking his head but still obeying the
little man departed again and presently
returned with an outfit that exceedingly
rejoiced jenkinss heart though it be-
trayed some signs of hard usage yet un-
deniably it was the correct thing with
joy our adventurer beheld the v-necked
blouse the wide-bottomed trousers and
the round cap with a ribbon bearing the
words in gold letters south dakota

   atta boy he exclaimed in delight
 me for those and you cop the prize-
package

   all right mein friend change dem
jenkins changed the sailor-suit might
have been made for him so neatly it
fitted and becoming say now that
the infernal dress-suit lay on a chair jen-
kins breathed deep with relief admir-
ingly he looked himself over set the
round cap on his head put his hands
on his hips and grinned

   aye aye sir exclaimed he  sou
by souwest clew up the jiggers spank
the ratline-topsls split the ships log
and carry the kindling into the galley
avast you lubber belay there-and
say unk i havent had a bite for lord
knows how long thanks i will since
you insist

  he pulled a chair up to the table
poured a cup of tea helped himself to
rye-bread sausage schmierkase and
onions and made a good meal while the
little man surveyed him with eyes that
showed signs of alarm once more

    it iss a pity jenkins heard him mur-
mur regretfully a pity mit him so
young

   never mind unk mumbled jenkins
indistinctly around a huge mouthful of
bread and cheese  im over seven
come on now slide us the kicks and the
three bones

  the little man in silence produced a
pair of decent shoes and three dollars in
silver jenkins slid this wealth into the
right-hand pocket of his new trousers-
the pocket seemed very oddly located
thought he-and transferred his old
stand-by of forty-seven cents his pencil
bill jenkins buccaneer



keys and small trifles to the other
pocket

   im getting the hot end of the poker
this deal unk said he surveying the
dress-suit again  come on now come
on give me-

   i haf only two more tings to gif you
mein friend the other replied raising
his hand expressively

   what are those asked bill with
sudden expectations

   mein blessing und hope for your
speedy recovery

   good night im on my way slide
me out through the shop unk and re-
member unk re-e-e-member you never
knew me heard of me or saw me get
me

   goot-by said the hebrew non-
committally as he piloted him through
the dingy little shop to the front door

  this jenkins opened with all the bold-
ness of a heart that feels itself guiltless
he cocked his round cap jauntily on one
side hitched up his trousers round a
stomach that felt pleasantly the comfort
of the hearty meal climbed the area-
steps to the street and so departed from
the premises of morris rosenkatz as the
sign on the window informed him

   ta-ta morris said he as he swung
down the wet and sloppy sidewalk
 some of these days ill be on top and
when i am i wont forget you aw
revaw

  the chase of the victory was begun

chapter xr

a close shave or two

with the assumption of bravery
that his situation necessitated
yet with inward qualms produced
by the appalling publicity of the street
our adventurer navigated past a row of
mean shops and dwellings took the first
turn at random and kept straight be-
fore him

  the sailor togs he now discovered
after all caused him considerable un-

easiness what could be more conspicu-
ous  jenkins fancied everybody was
staring at him and longed for wings like
a dove that he might fly away and be
at peace

  in this cross-street numbers of people
were standing around with here and there
a cop or two some were laughing others
talking most of them were keeping a
weather eye on the eaves of a dingy
six-story building which jenkins realized
with a pang of alarm must be the front
of the same one from the back of which
he had escaped at the end of the block
he also caught sight of a black maria
shivering slightly he hastened on

   gee  he reflected turning a trifle
blue around the gills  if my dope turns
out to be wormy this time im cooked

  he could not simply could not bring
himself to tread the sidewalk in front of
that building at the door or at some
window might there not be lurking some
individual who had seen him the night
before when he had been brought there
drugged and unconscious might he not
on the instant be identified arrested
haled away to durance vile would not
the fact of his having taken a disguise
surely incriminate him

  jenkins knew that  yes  was the an-
swer to all these questions and who
was there to testify for him to save
him nobody his heart quaked within
him as he shied off crossed the street
with as good an imitation of a rolling
jack-tar gait as he could assume and
came abreast of the house of dread all
at once he perceived a rotund officer who
-so it seemed to him-was barring his
way stabbed with panic jenkins never-
theless held game he pulled a facetious
smile jerked a thumb toward the roof
and said

   well matey if youd had a guy like
me to shin up the spinnaker and nail him
youd of mitted him by now

  a look of large surprise widened the
officers optics for a second jenkins
thought his remark was going to be taken
as an offer and with alarm foresaw him-


all-story weekly

self compelled to swarm up shaky lad-
ders and creep over that horrible slip-
pery roof of slate-this time with boots
on-in pursuit of himself but the offi-
cer only raised a repelling hand and waved
him away

   move on you rummy he growled
 by the map on ye an the gab o ye
youve been scrappin an yre half-soused
now if you know whats healthy youll
go an keep goin see dont lemme see
ye on this beat again or ill pull ye
move on

  gulping with terror and relief at one
and the same time jenkins hastily de-
parted from a neighborhood which prom-
ised to be so extremely unpleasant half
a minute later still a free man he had
swung round the comer into a wider and
more reputable thoroughfare and felt
that safety was in sight

  they hadnt got him nailed down yet
he reflected the all-in signal was a long
way from being rung on him still he
turned a few more comers to shake off
all danger and it was only after some
ten minutes brisk walking that he felt
secure enough to halt his stride go into
a cigar-stand and buy a couple of ten-
cent smokes

  beatified by the taste of good tobacco
after long abstinence he once more set
out with a mind now almost wholly
free from alarm he took stock of the
situation as he trudged along in the chill
drizzle through unknown streets with a
trail of cigar-smoke blowing in the sep-
tember breeze the way he now felt
was clear for some decisive action
though his total cash was but three dol-
lars and twenty-seven cents he had eaten
heartily and he possessed clothing which
would fit the part he meant to play to
at

  the canal he knew would be easily
found by following it he would be cer-
tain to locate the yacht after that he
counted fully on being able to handle any
situation that might arise pursuing his
way with high hopes in his soul and a
good cigar in his mouth he felt that life

was after all very good and that the
prizes which nature awards to the strong
now lay almost within his grasp

  but where was the canal

  jenkins didnt dare ask anybody lest
he awaken suspicion and no matter how
many streets he walked along or how
many crossways he peered down he
caught no sight of shipping after half
an hour of this fruitless search a barbers
pole reminded him he hadnt had a shave
since having left new york his sandy
stubble bristled like-well like bristles
sally must positively not see him thus
whether true to him or false jenkins
knew he couldnt face her in any such
condition

   me for the mowing said he and
entered the tonsorial establishment

  it proved to be very small a mere
wedge-shaped little place with only two
chairs and having a door that opened
on some other street at the rear

  with a free-and-easy wave of the hand
such as befitted his new character of jolly
tar he greeted the only barber in sight

   lay alongside capn and reef my
kelp pdq 

  the barber a thin nervous man peered
at him over a pair of silver-bowed spec-
tacles just a bit surprised he pointed
toward one of the chairs jenkins hung
his jaunty little cap on a hook sat down
and relaxed

  ah this was comfort this was lux-
ury our adventurer congratulated him-
self on his escape and gloated over the
inevitable justice he intended to exact
despite all those who were conspiring
against him

  pondering on their terror and humilia-
tion soon to come he observed the various
shaving-mugs bottles and so on the
posters and calendars that for the most
part displayed abundant feminine charms
and finally began to study out two or
three printed notices that he could see
reflected in the mirror the letters came
backward but jenkins found he could
read them with a little effort and the
task diverted him
bill jenkins buccaneer



  just as he was well lathered and the
razor had swept a clean place near his
right ear the door opened to his
amazement and alarm a sailor entered
the shop imagine his disturbed state
of mind if you can at seeing another
nautical rig very like his own on the per-
son of a bona-fide marine jenkinss
heart turned sick he shut his eyes and
groaned slightly

   pull sir inquired the barber with
anxiety

   no no its nothing answered jen-
kins weakly  only get a move on pro-
fessor ive got to catch a boat

  a

   go on reap the crop and can all
chatter said jenkins  and the quicker
you do it the bigger tip ill slide you
see

  nodding the barber began again with
renewed energy jenkinss hopes rose a
very little maybe the shave would only
take a couple of minutes now and he
might get away before any complications
should ensue but such was not written
on the book of fate since the illustrious
don quixote himself had once become
entangled in misadventures at a barbers
shop how could simple bill jenkins hope
to escape them

  jenkins lay quiet as a mouse praying
his stars that the sailor might pay no
heed to him this alas was not to be
for hardly had the newcomer eye fallen
on jenkins when he advanced to the chair
with a cheerful smile shifted a quid in
his cheek and remarked

  hello kid

  hello yourself stalled jenkins
 whats doing

   heluva lot we aint got him yet
but hes a gone coon sure as shootin
wheres leary

   search me

   huh grunted the sailor in a tone
fehat only too clearly told jenkins he had
blundered

  on board i mean jenkins hastily
corrected himself why 

  the sailor stared at him a moment

  with widening eyes then spat profusely
and demanded

  on-what

   on board of course jenkins stoutly
maintained while the barber lathered his
neck

  the others silence as he eyed the un-
fortunate in the chair shot a chill to
jenkinss marrow suddenly with a sus-
picion by no means to be mistaken the
sailor shot out another question

    what ship are you on anyhow

  a pang of wo transfixed jenkins as
he realized in the stress of the moment
he had totally forgotten the words printed
on the ribbon round his cap desperately
he tried to catch sight of it in the mir-
ror but quite in vain and to have sat
up looked directly at it and then an-
swered would have been entirely too raw
daring not refuse to speak and certain
only that the name was the  south some-
thing jenkins grabbed desperately at a
straw and said

   south carolina of course

   south-

  the sailors tone was incomprehensibly
startled then suddenly his mouth
closed with a snap saying no more he
retreated sat down in one of the chairs
behind jenkins and with an expression
of hostility and suspicion-as jenkins
could just make out in the mirror by
painfully straining his eyes - began
watching him

  it was nothing less than panic that now
laid hold on the soul of our hero ar-
dently he longed for escape what mat-
tered it though his stubble was but half
removed what mattered anything if he
were now falling into some unknown and
terrifying entanglement once more

   holy poker thought he in anguish
 as a trouble-maker this suit seems to


have stacked me into the real stew
bitterly he cursed the evil inspiration
which had brought him to this pass

  directly above the head of the sailor
as he sat there studying jenkins the un-
fortunate young mans eye fell on a poster
bearing the portrait of a fellow in nau-


all-story weekly

  tical rig and though he could make out
nothing of the fine print underneath one
word stood out distinctly backward in
the glass

  then understanding dawned on jen-
kins a sickening fear pervaded his
being sweating and trembling he lay
there supine under the hands of the ton-
sorial artist panting for some chance to
escape

  his anguish became unspeakable when
standing up with suspicious suddenness
the sailor removed jenkinss cap from its
hook glanced at the lettering there and
hung it up again then stopping for
nothing he abruptly left the shop as if
with some important business calling him

  jenkinss cosmic distress gendered a
flash of inspiration

   dont let him go  he cried strug-
gling up

   what demanded the barber
amazed

   thats the deserter you boob 
ejaculated our adventurer sitting half
shaved in the chair and pointing toward
the doorway  help me land him-im
a marine detective-and ill go fifty-fifty
with you on the reward i just now
tumbled get busy

  swept clean off his feet by this lure
the barber ran to the door razor still in
hand jenkins jumped out of the chair
as though to follow him then seeing
him already on the sidewalk peering
down the street he tiptoed to the rear
exit

  on the way he snatched his cap from
the hook a second later with one-half
his face shaven clean and the other cov-
ered with lather and bristles and with a
towel round his neck the figure of a
fleeing seaman might have been observed
making tracks down an alley might
have had any been there to see but no-
body was

  gee panted jenkins ducking into
a doorway he snatched off the towel

wiped his face clean stuffed the towel
into his blouse and once more resumed
his hegira

  no longer now he sought the canal
nothing could be more dangerous for a
deserter from the united states navy
than to hang around the water-front in-
stinct told him to get as far away from
water as possible to strike for the coun-
try and seek safety in the rural regions

if he walked far enough and kept on
walking he knew he certainly must reach
places where nobody would ever think of
looking for a sailor therefore he walked

  for about an hour and a half he kept
his course unmolested though in a con-
tinual sweat of terror every policeman
every pedestrian that regarded him filled
him with apprehension he suffered a
thousand pangs thinking each moment to
feel the hand of the law on his shoulder
and find himself face to face with arrest

  of course he could soon prove his in-
nocence on the desertion charge but
what of all the other charges inevitably
one or another would land him and any
interference with his plans would just
now be fatal so he kept on and on
under the fine incessant drizzle his feet 
wet his spirits low and hope fast ebbing
in his heart

  the hilarious scramble that was due to
begin for sally and the coin he cogi-
tated seemed to have struck a severe
frost cross-fires of anxiety bombarded
him

  men do not usually walk at large with
only one side of the face shaven and to
enter another shop and ask to have the
job completed was a thing he dared not
do it would lead to observation ques-
tionings and difficulties hence conceal-
ing his face as best he could in his hand
which he held to his jaw as if suffering
the pangs of toothache he proceeded

  after what seemed an endless tramp
the suburbs thinned out they gave
place to open fields and woods with
infinite relief though troubled at the in-
congruity of his marine costume in this
bucolic setting and now beginning to
bill jenkins buccaneer



feel again the pangs of hunger jenkins
kept his best foot forward along a muddy
country road

  solitude was grateful to his bruised
and battered spirit he no longer had to
keep his hand on his jaw except when he
met an occasional farmer the attention
he seemed to attract from all such greatly
embarrassed him but he could not
avoid it

  passing a country school where recess
had liberated a swarm of children he had
to submit to being tagged by numerous
urchins till the ringing of the school-bell
haled hem away from the entrancing
spectacle he offered jenkins still said
nothing but-his only plan now being to
put as much distance between himself and
schenectady as possible-plodded on and
on and on

  toward midday he spied a sight that
gladdened his heart over a stone wall
a farmhouse was visible with a long ell
running out to a barn in a window of
the ell stood a shaving-mug peering over
the wall jenkins made perfectly sure of
this fact he could even see the handle
of a brush projecting from that mug a
plan took form in his mind why not

   if theres only a razor there too
thought he  ill put the ripsaw to this
foliage mighty sudden

  once rid of his extraordinary facial
adornment he felt his task would be
largely simplified he waited therefore
spying out the land no sign of danger
threatened from the chimney of the
house not even a thread of smoke was
drifting on the wet air jenkins figured
the family must be away

  encouraged by this conclusion and
sure nobody was visible along the road
he escaladed the wall approached the
window cautiously and peered in bliss
a razor lay on the sill half a minute
later jenkins had possessed himself of the
razor and the mug and was executing a
strategic retreat to some place where he
could remove the offending half-portion of
spinach

  the open door of a detached shed

beckoned him invitingly thither jen-
kins hastened stopping only long enough
at a pump to fill the mug under cover
he hastily withdrew the towel from his
blouse lathered himself again and set to
work by the sense of feeling alone

  there was feeling enough all right to
have guided a dozen men

   suffering tripe what is this any-
how a harrow

  some of the bristles came away whit-
tled through others yielded up their
roots and died game to the last jenkins
thought of the time he had hoed up po-
tatoes on puringtons farm this re-
minded him of it blood began to flow
too

  maybe its only a piece of the smiling-
muscle ive cut out though he consoled
himself  i wont ever need that again
anyhow

 bow-wow-www

   damn said jenkins giving a final
rake and carrying away a whole planta-
tion of whiskers the barking of a dog
just now and so very near at hand au-
gured ill

  jenkins peered through a crack ob-
served a loose-hung hound at the back
door of the house and felt the shivers
chase themselves up his spine the
hounds hair was velveted all along its
back in a most businesslike manner and
its vociferations might have waked the
dead

  that the canine uproar had waked the
living anyhow now suddenly became ap-
parent the house door opened and jen-
kins beheld a long lean gangling agricul-
tural person in shirt-sleeves peering in
tently toward the shed

  skitch em prince remarked the
farmer  what now skunk or chicken-
thief ill dum soon find out take em
prince-skitch em

  prince proceeded toward the shed
walking on his toes and emitting contin-
uous sounds of hostility the plow-pusher
retired into the house with purposeful
haste

   help groaned jenkins his eye still


all-story weekly

at the crack as he perceived the farmer
reappear with a shotgun in his corded
fist the farmer still adjuring prince to
commence skitching also advanced shed-
ward

  with wild eyes our adventurer agon-
izingly looked about him for a means of
exit the door whereby he had entered
was impossible ah there was another
yes behind him at the rear of the shed
it offered hopes of safety clutching the
mug as a possible weapon in case of
hand-to-hand war and with the towel
still round his neck jenkins ran to that
door his face was white almost as the
lather that still decked it here and there
as he cast the door open and leaped
through

   a tremendous cackling squawking and
flapping greeted him hens flew wildly
battering themselves against whitewashed
walls and winging their way overhead as
jenkins burst through their quiet domes-
ticity like an elephant through an after-
noon tea-party

  slam went another door now jen-
kins was in the open running through a
hen-yard the wire netting delayed him
but an instant he charged through it
like a regiment of french poilus through
wire entanglements and fled across a
turnip-field toward an orchard

   behind a cry of startled wonder accel-
erated his progress almost any farmer
would be apt to feel surprise at seeing a
sailor burst out of his hen-house with a
towel round his neck and a shaving-mug
in his hand prince snarling wildly gave
chase so did the farmer a very pretty
little athletic event in the hundred-yard-
dash line was pulled off right there
neath the shade of the old apple-tree

  but now prince was imminently at
hand jenkins saw slavering jaws and
white fangs wheeling he flung the mug
luck sent it crashing into princes eye
snarls gave place to howls of anguish
and prince with more than a bellyful of
fight hit the high place for home with his
tail so far between his legs that it stuck
out in front and almost tripped him

  jenkins turned again and fled weapon-
less

  bang

   ow

  rock-salt in sufficiently large lumps is
highly painful even though not danger-
ous when fired from a rusty shotgun at
one hundred paces jenkinss speed in-
creased whether the gun was double-
barreled and whether the ruralite was
still pursuing he stayed not to inquire
as prince hiked one way he hiked the
other doing a regular barney oldfield
toward the stone wall at the foot of the
orchard

  i dont know or care who holds the
worlds record for hurdling for whoever
it is or whatever that record is jenkins
beat it by a clean two feet as he went
over the wall

  he landed in blackberry-bushes scram-
bled through reached a road and de-
parted with celerity for half a mile he
ran-or was it a mile then all at once
he stopped

  before him lay a bridge and under
that bridge passed a stream of water
which in spite of all his agitation he
recognized as nothing more or less than
the erie canal

chapter xiv

an unexpected meeting

the sight of this placid and un-
troubled waterway stretching off on
either hand between fertile fields
and sparsely wooded knolls brought jen-
kins to himself panting he regarded the
canal as though it had been the greatest
curiosity in the world sudden readjust-
ments took place in his mind

  the immediate past with all its pains
and dangers now dropped away in its
place the larger issue rose again the
victory malcolm everett the reward
and sally swung into the current of his
mind in fine jenkins had all at once
found himself once more

   gee he exclaimed drawing a deep
bill jenkins buccaneer



breath as he leaned against the bridge
railing and peered down at the canal
 as a shave that was some craw-craw
shave but forget it kid im back on
the job now with both feet and that
goes

  enheartened by this decision and tak-
ing as a good omen the fact that his wild
flight had brought him directly back to
the canal itself jenkins wasted no time
in deliberation but - having first deter-
mined that the rock-salt had not injured
him -set out in pursuit of the elusive
yacht he clambered down the embank-
ment at the end of the bridge reached
the tow-path and for a moment stood
undecided which way to go

  the sight of water suggested that he
wash his face still smeared with lather
this he did by letting down his towel
wetting the end and swabbing himself
vigorously he wrung out the towel
rolled it up and stuffed it back inside his
blouse as likely to be useful passed a
satisfied hand over his now sketchily
shaven chin and at a brisk pace depart-
ed on his still-hunt for gold and his lady-
love

  what seemed to him a kind of instinct
impelled him to take a direction toward
the left of his line of flight along the road
far ahead he perceived something that
looked like a cloud of smoke hanging high
in the heavens this he figured marked
the position of schenectady and as the
victory had now passed beyond that city
toward buffalo of course he must go in
that general direction

  too wise he to venture  passing
through the city itself however no
when he should get back to the suburbs
he would make a wide detour and strike
the canal again on the other side of the
dangerous place jenkins had it all fig-
ured out very neatly as you see

  as he walked along the path hard-
beaten by uncounted thousands of mules
his spirits began to rise once more no
danger threatened no one was pur-
suing him far away behind down the
straight reach of the canal a boat was

lazily moving in the opposite direction
in fields to right and left an occasional
farmer was at work a ragged boy
perched on the heel-path across the canal
fished intently

  bill waved his hand at the urchin who
stared at him with mute amaze and
passed on whistling the novelty and
beauty of the scene conspired with his
growing hopes to raise his spirits high
he thought that despite the lowering
weather he never had beheld a more
peaceful pleasing landscape here a
flotilla of ducks paddling along the water-
way there a kingfisher darting over the
surface farther on a long - legged crane
that flapped away into a patch of woods
all entertained him greatly  fine busi-
ness thought jenkins as a blues-
annihilator this pursuit of justice along
the picturesque canal seemed to him a
roll of all-wool unshrinkable goods

  after about an hours walk however a
keen and ever - growing pang of hunger
began to make itself insistently felt also
blisters began to form on both heels
caused by the ill-fitting boots morris
rosenkatz had given him

  jenkinss pace slackened a little as it
became something of a limp his whistle
ceased farmhouses barns and hay-
stacks along the way now looked distinct-
ly less interesting jenkins would have
traded them all for his own shoes a place
to sit down and a plate of  ham-and

  so it was that rounding a long bend
that skirted a hill our adventurer beheld
with almost rapture a little shanty perched
beside the tow-path a shanty with a man
sitting before it on a bench while from a
stove-pipe at the rear drifted promising
smoke

  bench and smoke meant rest and eats
jenkins still had three dollars and thirty-
seven cents and he knew that money
talked even though all it had ever said
to him had been  good-by he hastened
his gait in spite ofblisters and weari-
ness for now relief was close at hand
his mouth watered at thought of meat
potatoes pie and coffee the chow he


all-story weekly

told himself would look pretty minus
three minutes after he connected

  as he approached the shanty he be-
came aware of a large beam projecting
from the canal toward it and also saw a
white mushroomlike object beyond this
object presently revealed itself as an un-
usually big cotton umbrella with its han-
dle stuck into the ground on the other
side of the building

  a nearer view disclosed a man seated
beneath the umbrella with an easel in
front of him jenkins recognized that a
painter was at work delineating a view
of the canal and was well pleased he
approved of art but had never seen any
created this opportunity was welcome

  on and on he limped came close and
stopping touched his cap

   how do said he to the old man on
the bench  can i get any feed here

   feed queried the lock-keeper-for
such was his entitlement-as he removed
a short t d with considerable curios-
ity his littie black eyes set in a million
wrinkles observed the strange marine
figure before him a sailor on the canal
was certainly a novelty the painter
meanwhile poised his brush in air won-
dering whether there was any possible
way to work a mariner into a view of an
erie canal lock

   feed sure repeated jenkins ad-
vancing

  the old man shook his head x

   we dont never feed -here said he
decisively

   what

   never do he affirmed putting his
pipe back and clamping his jaw on it
 four mile up though you can git all
the hay you want

   hay

   sartin why not what dyou feed
your mules on anyhow oysters

  mules snorted jenkins reddening
at sound of a chuckle from behind the
canvas on the eas  whats the idea
mules i mean chow for myself eats
ill come across with the coin all right
too get me

  oh answered the ancient one sol-
emnly  why didnt ye say so at fust
i dont run no caffy young man but fer
a consideration i might perduce some-
thin how much you willin to pay
astonished jenkins stared at him
then he answered

   a quarter

   nup fiftys my lowest

   gee youre one hospitable guy
arent you commented jenkins  but
no matter fifty goes what after
all was a little loose change when a
large fortune lay right ahead  chase
up some lunch and ill go you the
quicker the sooner

  the lock-keeper eyed him with sus-
picion what speech was this from a
u s navy tar nevertheless he arose
stiffly for age and rheumatism had sadly
lamed him and he hobbled into the
shack jenkins followed unbidden

  a curiously disordered place it was
with horse-collars and bits of harness
ropes and iron-mongery in corners a
spavined table and a chair or two for its
entire equipment

  with a sigh of relief jenkins sank into
the most likely-looking chair took off
his torturing boots and relapsed into
inertia now for the first time as he sat
there watching the old man pottering
about in a broken-backed way at a
rough-board little pantry he realized how
very much played-out he was yes in
the near future he meant to have the
gold and the girl but what a price fie
was paying-what a price

  the old man set dishes on the table
turned and demanded

   give us the half

  huh oh - all right not taking
any jong shots are you and he pro-
duced two quarters which the lock-keep-
er pocketed with-

   nup i aint been on this here canal
fifty-three years fer nothin go on
now eat there tis

  jenkins drew up to the festive board
and with some dismay observed rye
bread onions cheese and cold tea the
bill jenkins buccaneer



met potato pie and coffee he had
mentally reveled in now faded into

vacancy

  suffering moses he ejaculated
 just the same as breakfast is that
all there is in this neck o the woods

   dunno its all i got anyhow
take it er leave it but no money re-
funded replied the keeper groaning
jenkins attacked the meal the old man
meanwhile sat down across the table
from him and kept those keen glittering
little eyes on him every moment in a
most disconcerting manner obviously
the ancient one had no intention of
losing any cutlery

  famine stimulated jenkins and he
managed to get away with everything
but the last onion with a suspicious
air the keeper said

   jedgin by your appetite young
feller youd ha done better not to run
away at all its a hungry job runnin
away is fer them thats used to uncle
sams feed

   what do you think i am anyhow
demanded jenkins angrily  a de-
serter as well now as later to meet
the charge and repel it

   its none o my business what ye be
but-

   see here said bill determined that
for the sake of safety he must allay all
such suspicions  im no more a de-
serter than you are im on shore-leave
get me furlough ive been at sea so
much i thought id take a flash at this
kind of navigation for a change my
homes in buffalo and im hiking part
of the way thats all get me

  the old one pondered all this a mo-
ment with deliberation then blowing
a cloud of smoke he questioned

   where did you say you was goin
   buffalo of course

   do they know youre runnin at
large

   who demanded jenkins angrily

   your keepers you look human an
you can talk but when it comes to travel
you aint there you aint headed fer no

buffalo young feller the way youre
goin i callate youll jest about make
eastport maine now-

  a long-drawn hail down the canal in-
terrupted his discourse open-mouthed
and sore astonished to learn abruptly that
every step so painfully trodden along the
canal had in reality been carrying him
farther and farther from his goal the un-
happy jenkins stared in silence at the old
man then as the latter got up from
his chair and hobbled doorward he ex-
claimed

  hey wait a minute tell me-

   cant wait theres a boat cornin
to be locked up

  jenkins too arose still half-dazed
he observed the aged one fumbling in his
pockets jenkinss instinct to be helpful
reasserted itself maybe he could assist

   what are you trying to find asked
he  the key

   key demanded the old man turn-
ing  what key

   why to lock the boat up with of
course you said-

  a peculiar sound vaguely resembling
laughter issued from the wrinkled throat
then words became distinguishable

  shhh shhh sonny dont let em
hear ye whatever ye do its a livin
death they say

   what is

   insane asylum come long out here
now an lam somethin

  amazed and understanding nothing of
all this jenkins obeyed out of the
shack he followed the old man who now
approached the big beam that overhung
the tow-path

  some distance down the canal a team
of mules hitched tandem was plodding
round the curve on the foremost mule
sat a youth far behind at the end of
a stout hawser followed a ponderous
blunt-nosed craft blessed with the
euphonious cognomen of lottie peck

  at these objects jenkins stared with
an interest that for the moment quite
obliterated his resentment against the old
mans unwarranted gibes


all-story weekly

    the mules came close off jumped the
 youth with a profanely qualified com-
 mand he halted his animals the tow-
 rope sagged and dropped into the water
 at the bows of the boat a man in shirt-
 sleeves released it the boat moved ma-
 jestially forward deftly guided by a very
 ruddy individual at the long tiller

   in between the granite walls that
 jenkins now saw faced the canal at this
 point it ran toward a massive double
 gate of planks through which streams of
 water were dribbling for the first time
 our adventurer noted that the water-level
 back of that gate was higher than in
 front of it just what was about to
 happen he knew not but it was all very
 interesting gaping a little he stood
 there near a solid iron post set into the
 masonry coping as the boat slid on and
 on

    oh i see thought jenkins
  that gate is the bumper the boat
 butts into it and stops and then-then
 they boost it up some way-maybe with
 jacks and then-

    a rope came sprangling ashore hurled
 by the shirt-sleeved man at the bows

     hey jack he shouted at jenkins
 give us a hand the old mans rheu-
 matic bend that painter round the post
an slack her down

    huh exclaimed jenkins dodging
 the rope  what say

    that painter dum it bend that
 painter round the post an get a move
 on

   oh and jenkins turning started
 a little uncertainly toward the easel he
 took a few steps what was it all about
 he wondered why should anybody ask
 him to lay violent hands on a perfectly
 inoffensive painter and bend him round
 a post no telling still the command
 had been absolutely explicit in the
 plainest possible english moreover it
 was now being violently repeated with
 a hurricane of profanity	t

     where you goin you three-starred
 son of a qualified canine howled the
 man in thebows the old lock-keeper

turning began to hobble with the unusual
celerity toward the rope on the ground
the youth came running too

   whats nibbling all you nuts any-
how shouted jenkins in sudden pas-
sion as he wheeled toward the boat once
more  you tell me to do something
and then when i get busy you raise a
roar he flung his arm toward the man
at the easel  you told me to bend that
painter-

  a composite burst of hilarity from
artist lock-keeper youth helmsman and
bow-tender shattered the speech from
his lips as the youth snatched up the
rope took a hitch round the iron post
and eased the ponderous boat to a halt
none too soon for her stem lay not two
feet from the gate

   sonny remarked the aged one com-
ing close and peering up at jenkins with
pitying eyes  im goin to give ye a
bit of advice will ye take it from a
man old enough to be yr gransir

   advice repeated jenkins his face
aflame while both men on the boat the
youth and the artist looked their eyes
full and listened in a painful silence
 what dyou mean advice

   go back my son go straight back
   back-where

   where you broke out of or home
if you got one taint safe taint right
ner wise ner even christian fer you to
be left wanderin round this way buf-
falo you said this here boat will take
ye thar jest as nice an quiet an e-e-easy
as can be nothin to worrit ye nothin
to bother youll be fed an looked after
an taken all the way back if you aint
got no money ill do at least one humane
act afore i die an contribute a dollar
towards-

  can that interrupted jenkins
burning with shame  what dyou think
i am anyhow a pauper ive got
 and-

  the lock-keeper turned toward the
steersman

   hey jake hes got  said
he  take him to buffalo fer that 
bill jenkins buccaneer



   huh queried the ruddy man with
an expression of surprise

   hes harmless continued the aged
one  do one good act fer to wipe off
some o your many sins jake ive
knowed men to git shot along the canal
fer not understandin-men not in sailor
cloes neither save him by takin him
to buffalo an youll be rewarded above
 all right let him come along as-
sented the steersman  only hes gotta
stay in the cabin all the way

   go my boy an my blessin be on
ye said the ancient one with real feel
ing  i had a son once that was kind
of the same way an i understand we
done all we could fer him but twant
no use i understand good-by
jenkins answered nothing he could
not trust himself to speak but rage
did not obscure his reason here was a
chance unexpected as it was opportune
to pursue the yacht unmolested and in
perfect safety to get constant news oi
her to set himself forward on his difficult
way only a madman could have re-
fused

  without a word he therefore strode to
the granite coping of the lock gauged
the distance to the deck of the canal-
boat-now about two feet from the edge
and perhaps four below it-and jumped
aboard the helmsman eying him nar-
rowly spoke no word but merely jerked
his thumb in the direction of the deck-
house close in front of the long tiller

  jenkins understood he walked to it
trembling with indignation entered the
little door descended a steep half-dozen
steps and found himself in a square
stuffy room lighted only by a row of
small windows near the top

  at a table in the center of the room
two men were sitting deep in conversa-
tion with a bottle between them both
looked up at the new arrival

  jenkins saw that one was thin dark
and well-dressed at sight of the other
he started back with an exclamation he
only just succeeded in turning into a
cough

  do you wonder at his astonishment
and alarm let me tell you the reason
for them the second man there before
him was-youd never guess it in a
thousand years-was simoon sam

chapter xv

a dash in the dark

for the second or third time in his
entire life the urgent stress of a
crisis whipped bill jenkinss wits to
swift action

  what had happened and why he
knew not but the fact remained that
there simoon sam sat visibly in a chair
before him holding conference with a
stranger over a square-face- of strong
waters

  jenkins knew perfectly well that to
make himself known or even be recog-
nized would in all probability be abso-
lutely fatal to all his hopes and end his
piratical career forthwith arrest ex-
posure punishment loss of everything
that now made life worth living would
all follow in natural sequence there-
fore he must not be recognized

  for a tense moment sam held the in-
truder under a powerful and angry gaze
jenkinss heart shriveled to the size of a
dried mustard-seed and ceased function-
ing altogether at that instant he stood
upon the brink of an abyss

  but he didnt fall over with a thrill
of hope he saw in sams ferocious optics
no sign of recognition sam had never
beheld him save by uncertain artificial
light and in totally other clothing jen-
kinss disguise was sufficient to protect
him nothing else mattered not even
sams bellow of

   who the blink - blank are you you
swab an what are you doin here
jenkins made no answer weakly by
reason of the reaction from panic to joy
he leaned against the cabin wall stared
at sam and shook his head his only
game he realized was to assume the role
that fate and all hands seemed deter-

mined to thrust upon him  assume a
virtue if you have it not  floated through
his brain since lunacy might be a virtue
in this case why he would bea lunatic
nothing simpler

  sam roared out his question again this
time embellished with a large variety of
adjectives and qualifications he also
banged the table savagely with his glass
jenkins realizing that this was one of
sams bad days still replied nothing he
let his mouth droop open a little half
closed his eyes and smiled a smile that
would have made angels weep then as
though mustering all his strength he
murmured

   i couldnt find the key to the canal
lock so theyre sending me back to the
buffalo asylum

  dead silence greeted this remark jen-
kins subsided on to a berth at the left of
the cabin rolled over and became inert
holding his breath feeling his heart
pound madly against his ribs he listened
keenly

  another one shplp me he heard
simoon exclaim in a startled almost awed
voice  worse n the one that got away
damfe aint what is this mac - an
omen or somethin

   search me answered the other
came a pause  kind of peculiar
though i must say ive been in the
game eighteen years sam and never saw
it equalled to be working on an asylum
case and run into this-well-

  another silence then heavy footsteps
sounded on the cabin floor jenkins
heard sams voice addressing somebody
out through the door

  jake oh jake

   what you want now replied the
helmsman

   how about this what is it an
where did it come from

   harmless i reckon jake assured
the irate one  dunno nuthin about it
goin to buffalo to some home or
nuther

   well now see here- sam began
to expostulate but mac with a hasty

 pssst pssst interrupted him jen-
kins listening with all  his might heard
this colloquy

   what is it what you want

   shhh dont kick up a ruction
sam

   why not

   come back here and sit down and
ill tell you

   sams footfalls crossed the floor again
a chair creaked as his two hundred
pounds settled into it

   well what demanded he

   dont you see

   no damfi do

  liquid gurgled from the bottle-neck
jenkins realized with considerable joy
that sam had fallen off the water-wagon
and that his wits would therefore be more
or less fogged - probably more if what
sally had told him had been true con-
cerning the mans habits

   its this way explained mac lower-
ing his tone still more so that our adven-
turer could just barely make out the
words and no more  in this game now
the possession of one bona-fide nut might
very likely prove highly important to us
and-

   hows that

   if weve got one taking him back to
the asylum it would lend all kinds of
color to the statement that we were
taking another back too my advice is
to let this bug stay right here and take
particularly good care not to let him get
away at least till we meet harvey at the
eagle house in utica harvey  know
what to do his judgment is o k all
the time a pause punctuated by the
sipping of liquid  with this harmless
loon as a ringer well -stand a lot better
chance of bagging the real game-that is
if you havent got cold feet and want to
quit before tackling the proposition

   me quit demanded simoon with a
silght hiccup  never when i set sail
for a port i never drop anchor till im
there and after the way that qualified
swab handed me my walking-papersjust
because i couldnt help a dod-ratted st-ow-
bill jenkins buccaneer



away messin up things an then escapin
you think id lay down on the propo-
sition not no sir im with you to a
finish mac an heres hopin he spends
the rest of his life where he belongs-in
the nut-foundry

  the glasses clinked again a great
white light dawned over jenkinss per-
turbed mind as he lay there sweating with
a bad attack of nerves  he seemed at
last to understand everything so then
sam had been fired from the victory on
his account jenkins smiled with joy at
this

  at any rate he had paid up part of the
score against his tormentor the rest was
equally clear everything seemed fitting
together like the parts of a cut-out puzzle
disgruntled sam had happened to meet
this mac individual one of the men now
trailing everett to force him back into
hamilton asylum

  mac taking advantage of his anger
had enlisted him in the plot they were
pursuing the victory traveling slowly and
safely-for who would ever think of
looking for passengers on a canal-boat
these days

  at utica they would join one harvey
unknown the other detective plotting
against everett after that a coup of
some kind or other was to be sprung it
all looked clear as crystal and everything
coincided with what sally had told him
in regard to the matter-all except sams
part in the affair which had developed
since jenkins had left the yacht

  with a joy so savage that it hurt and
made his soul quiver within him jenkins
realized he now stood on the edge of vital
developments fortune was about to hand
him a dazzling and totally unexpected
prize-package by falling in with the
plotters scheme and forwarding it he
could take a supreme revenge on everett
for having-as he now firmly believed-
cheated him out of his just dues and run
off with sally he felt like shouting
singing dancing but canny prudence
held him motionless listening with all his
ears

   pipe that will you he heard si-
moon thickly exclaim with a sound as
though striking a paper with his fist
 hes advertising for another mate al-
ready see here in the shipping colyume
im done permanent shelp me ill cut
his liver out first and then berth him in
bug harbor for life or im no ab

   whats that what you say asked
mac eagerly in a low tone  another
mate

  came a little tense silence then jen-
kins heard the whispered give-and-take
of questions and answers whereof he
caught nothing intelligible listen as he
might

  the boat meanwhile was rising stead-
ily in the lock the lower gate had been
closed the sluice-ways in the upper
opened jenkins heard the rushing of
waters

  from where he lay he could just sight
through one of the little windows along
the top of the cabin the granite wall
seemed sliding down now the coping
appeared the legs of a man a view of the
bottom part of the shanty the upward
motion ceased shouts oaths and com-
mands drifted in a hawser creaked
the wall began to slide backward lift-
ed to the higher level the boat was start-
ing toward the west again

  on our way thought jenkins

  safe and sound with everything falling
right from now on its a romp a fun-
fest with a dash of everything in it but
yellow 

  his thoughts raced with unusual celer-
ity things heretofore hidden seemed
plain even the now inaudible plottings
of simoon and the conspirator appeared
to lie open before his minds eye as the
boat slid gently up the canal with a
soothing murmur of waters along its side
jenkins felt he now understood the situa-
tion clearly

  obviously the disgruntled and vindic-
tive mate was arranging that mac should
apply for the job now vacant aboard the
yacht once there he and simoon would
work with the unknown harvey to kidnap


all-story weekly

everett and bear him back to hamilton
jenkins gloated over this idea could
anything more fully glut his vengeance
yes one thing could and that was-

   suffering tom-cats decided jenkins
 ill do the job myself

  could he why not what was to
prevent his getting that job himself
once installed aboard the yacht dis-
guised as a sailor why could he not treat
with simoon mac and harvey as with
equals why not hold them up for a
substantial sum of money dispose of
malcolm everett seize the girl and win
all tricks

  accused of being a buccaneer for noth-
ing why not play the bold game in real-
ity and win all at one supreme master-
stroke jenkinss heroic blood leaped in
his veins just how the thing was to be
brought about he knew not but on the
instant his resolve was firmly taken his
goals were now the victory and alter that
the eagle house utica weltering in a
sea of glad excitement he lay there in
the berth supremely thrilled with an-
ticipation of heroic deeds now close at
hand

  thus lifted high on waves of glory
began his journey aboard the good canal-
boat lottie peck

  now while i should like to trace our
heros mental processes and draw a pic-
ture of his feigned insanity during the
four-and-twenty hours that he spent
there the sweep of our story compels me
to elide this portion of the narrative

  jenkins lay low betraying no signs of
intelligence whatsoever a few times mac
and simoon examined him made him sit
up questioned him and tried to elicit in-
formation as to his personality but jen-
kinss fatuous smile and wandering an-
swers completely baffled them jake the
helmsman also individuals named tim-
mins snuffy and burke-all  trippers
as canal-boat freight-handlers are called
-took turns interrogating him-in vain

  jenkins lay entirely low till schenec-
tady and danger were far behind he
accepted food and tobacco as his due re-

mained quiescent and thanked his stars
that every moment was bringing him
nearer and nearer the consummation of
his burning hopes

  he slept little that night so feverish
were his thoughts in the morning un-
molested-though sam and mac kept
close surveillance on him - he went on
deck with a cigar that sam had given him
there he sat for some hours watching the
landscape unroll as the mules plodded on
ever on westward bound

  with interest he observed villages and
towns pass by locks low bridges feeders
waste-weirs and viaducts and all the busy
life and numerous devices along the route
of the great waterway he watched the
mules at the end of their  trick being
driven aboard the boat and stabled in the
hold forward while a fresh team was sent
ashore and harnessed to the tow-rope

  and ever he listened to the gossip of
the red-faced jake with one or other of
the boatmen picking up odd bits of canal
lore and stowing them away for on a
pinch who could tell what chance piece
of information might not pull him through
some supremely vital crisis

  let all this go with but a word of men-
tion time dragged on so did the lottie
peck noon passed and afternoon wore
on toward evening with increasing ten-
sion jenkins realized the time was close at
hand now for some sharp decisive action
before mac should get that job as mate
on board the yacht he himself must cop
it he must be ready to confront mac
and simoon and-master of the situation
-dictate terms to them

  with this idea in mind he waited till
the early twilight of autumn closed down
upon the world the two conspirators
were still below-decks as usual they
seemed entirely reluctant in fact to be
observed at all outside the cabin of the
lottie peck

  at the bows snuffy was smoking ciga-
rettes jake was asleep below having
given the helm to burke timmins was
dangling his feet overboard moodily
chewing tobacco and from time to time
bill jenkins buccaneer



giving vent to certain stanzas of an in-
terminable song in this wise

 on the erie canal it was all on a summers
    day

 sailed forth with my parents far away to
    alba nay

from out the clouds at noon that day there
came a dreadful storm
that piled the billows high about and filled us
with alarm

   timmins ruminated a bit while jen-
kins pondered escape how could it be
to watch his chance swing up on a low
bridge and run would fatally expose him
in no time simoon and mac instituting
pursuit would hale him back and
-then-

a man came rushing from a house saying

      snub up i pray

snub up your boat snub up alas snub up while
    yet you may

our captain cast one glance astern then forward
    glanced he

and said  my wife and little ones i never more
    shall see

 said dollinger the pilot man in noble words
    but few

 fear not but lean on dollinger and he will
    pull you through

come board come board the captain cried
     nor tempt so wild a storm

but still the raging mules advanced and still the
     boy strode on 

   then what jenkins knew he must
risk nothing by premature action all
might be lost by disclosing his real inten-
tion of flight diplomacy must get him
ashore and away not strength or speed
he longed for the liberty that the poetic
timmins enjoyed cast a wary eye on
burke at the helm and realizing that
burke had him well in view remained
quiescent timmins continued

 alas alas the sheeted rain the wind and tem-
     pests roar

alas the gallant ship and crew can nothing help
     them more

she balances she wavers now let her come
    about

if she misses stays and broaches to were lost
    without a doubt

avast belay take in more sail ho boy hold
    taut on the hind mules tail

   jenkins was thinking faster now the
references to mules had wakened a line
of possible action in his mind at the
next halt if he could only get on shore
with the mules and make off under cover
of the darkness all might yet be well
more confidently he drew at his cigar
and waited as best he could for night to
veil his desperate escape

  so overboard a keg of nails and anvils three
    we threw

likewise four bales of gunny-sacks two hundred
    pounds of glue

two sacks of corn four ditto wheat a box of
    books a cow

a violin lord byrons works a rip-saw and a
    sow

   sadder and more sad grew timminss
voice as he related the woes of shipwreck
on the raging canal far ahead in the
gathering dusk a little twinkle of light
appeared was it another boat approach-
ing a farmhouse a lock or a
changing-station no telling jenkins
could do no more than wait possessing
his fevered soul in patience and hoping
for the best

  sever the tow-line cripple the mules too
    late there comes a shock

another length the fated craft would have swum
    in the saving lock

and some did think of their little ones they
    never more might see

and others of waiting wives at home and
   mothers that grieved would be

   timmins now seemed almost moved to
tears jenkins too felt a great sadness
born of the evening calm of love for his
sally and of unsatisfied vengeance pos-
sess his soul intently he listened while
the lottie peck slid onward ever onward
in the gloom nearer and nearer to the
light upon the bank with almost heart-

    	this poem the only classic ever inspired by the erie canal is attributed to mark twain and
may be found in its entirety in his  roughing it under the title of  the aged pilot man but
probably timmins never heard of  roughing it or mark twain either-editor


all-story weekly

rending melancholy the poetic timmins
concluded

 but now a farmer brought a plank mysteri-
   ously inspired

and laying it unto the ship in silent awe re-
   tired

then every sufferer stood amazed that pilot man
   before

a moment stood then wondering turned and
   speechless walked ashore

  an omen of the best jenkins feit it
in his bones no longer now he doubt-
ed wondered feared deliverance surely
was at hand with rising courage he saw
timmins stand up and walk forward to
join snuffy the light was now very
close already jenkins could make out
three or four buildings near the bank in
front of the door of one of them hung a
sign with a foaming beaker thereon dim-
ly but certainly visible still higher rose
his heart

   getting up as the boat slackened with
the slowing of the mules he shambled
over to burke

    is that a saloon asked he smiling
foolishly as he pointed toward the sign

   tis that burke grunted  why

   i want a drink answered jenkins
simply

    forgit it said burke  aint you
batty enough as tis without pourin bug-
juice into whats left o your brains be-
sides you aint allowed on shore nohow

    please i want a drink repeated jen-
kins mildly  just one i most always
take ginger ale ive got two dollars and
thirty-seven cents and ill buy you a
drink too do we stop here long enough
for me to get you a drink

  a certain glint developed in burkes
eye as he cast a wary glance toward the
short companionway leading downward in
the gloom to a crack of light that outlined
the cabin door

    whist lad he cautioned  i aint
sayin we aint though im a sober man
mostly an thats no high-toned jint it
put timmins there to the bad takin too
many swifters as he went by tim owned
a store once but he poured it all down

his neck tis a good lad yare after all
even if your upper-works is a bit light
ill go ye only mind ye never a word
to them and he turned his thumb ex-
pressively toward the cabin

   all right smiled jenkins foolishly
 please come along i want my drink
now with a piece of ice in it do you
want ginger ale too

  the boat had come to a full stop now
and the tired mules were being unhooked
and led aboard by the boy while snuffy
and timmins vociferously urging another
pair from their stalls by deft tail-twisting
and a profusion of kicks were safely out
of sight

   twont take a minute an sure tis
no harm at all just one muttered burke
standing up

  he pointed at the bank an easy jump
from the low rail of the boat jenkins
needed no second hint he leaped safely
with burke at his side a moment later
quite unnoticed they had slipped into the
low groggery and had fronted up to the
bar

  jenkinss heart was thrashing wildly
but he managed to keep that stupid grin
still on his face under the crude light of
a hanging lamp with a tin shade as he
rolled half a dollar on the sloppy bar and
mumbled

   is that enough mister

   fer what demanded the blue-
jawed bruiser in a dirty apron who offi-
ciated as hebe to the canal men with
amaze he viewed this sailor-boy surely
a new species of genus homo

  burke raised an unseemly index-finger
tapped his brow and winked he
whispered

   four fingers of barb-wire an turpen-
tine fer me mike an ginger-ale fer the
kid and keep the change s all
right

   i getcha answered the gentle dis-
penser manipulating glasses and bottles
he slid the coin into a till  what kind
of a phillyloo-bird is it an where
bound

   search me replied burke eying his
bill jenkins buccaneer



four fingers-the drink looked more like
four thumbs big ones-while jenkins
sipped warm ginger-ale from a fly-
specked glass

   by the rig of him he might of came
off that swell yacht that just went along
to tie up at canajoharie fer the night
where dyou stack into him anyhow
burke shrugged indifferent shoulders
plainly the matter was one of no interest
to him jenkins still smiling vaguely
cast about him eyes that seemed to see
nothing but that in reality very clearly
perceived an open back door at the rear
of the grog-shop

   hey you burke what the-
a bellowing roar in simoon sams
formidable tones echoed from the direc-
tion of the canal startled burke
turned toward the door discovery was
upon him with what dire pains and
penalties who could say

  come along you whelp o misery
he shouted as he reached the door  if
youve got me in wrong with him-
jenkins flung his glass crashing on the
bar turned and like an unleashed grey-
hound darted out the back door he
sprawled over a keg fell flat picked
himself up and departed

  heavy feet trampled the floor of the
saloon he heeded them not harsh
voices shouted after him in the dark he
only increased his speed

  mindful of nothing save increasing the
distance instantly between himself and
the canal he whipped away into the
gloom bolted round a clump of trees
flicked into a country road and like a
hunted rabbit vanished in the all-em-
bracing shelter of the night

chapter xvi

a dazzling vision

pursuit such as there was proved
tardy and ineffectual jenkins heard
various cries commands and ex-
hortations also vague echoes of hurrying
footfalls but all these presently died out

and ceased the chase was over almost
before it had begun for in the darkness
jenkins had vanished like a wraith

  still he rap on and on he seemed
to be getting quite a bit of practice lately
a child fled screaming up a path at the
dim sight of him at a cross-road a
motherly old lady with a basket of eggs
threw up both hands and eggs went
down to meet so very abruptly a
sailor sprinting down a country road at
night coming from nowhere in particular
and bound ditto cannot help startling
motherly old ladies jenkins did not stop
to explain he just kept right on hiking

  after an indeterminate period blow-
ing hard he perceived a few lights that
seemed to indicate a settlement warily
he slackened his pace he halted and
observed no danger appeared to
threaten though inwardly he was quiv-
ering lest at any moment simoon sam
burst upon him like an avenging demon
forward he went again at a walk passed
without molestation down a village street
saw a railroad station and made for it
with a new plan germinating in his in-
tellect

  the name  canajoharie  stuck in his
mind there the bartender had said
the victory was going to tie up for the
night consequently thither he must go
instanter

  fully determined to strike for the first-
mates job on the yacht wreak vengeance
on malcolm everett wring tribute from
the detectives grab the reward and sally
and win the whole campaign by one swift
coup he made inquiries of a cadaverous
station-agent with a wen a cough and
an insatiable curiosity

   next train to canajoharie goes in an
hour an twenty minutes said he  tell
me you see lots o furrin lands on them
there ships dont ye

  sure whats the fare	

   sixty-five cents you got lots o
time tell me bout japan will ye

  good night said jenkins he
turned and walked away into the gloom
with considerable annoyance


all-story weekly

  why the ding-ding couldnt people let
him alone why must he be made
everybodys football butt and question -
box he felt his milk of human kind-
ness rapidly turning to a cheese as he
walked far down the track sat down on
the chill embankment behind a pile of
ties and resigned himself to the inter-
minable wait for the train

  thoughts hopes fears exultations
and despairs turn by turn possessed him
as he sat there chilly hungry tired and
tobaccoless only a great soul he as-
sured himself could endure such divers
and distressing misadventures and still
hold true to its original purpose this
made him feel better

  at the end of a few eons a whistle
sounded far away soon after jenkins
was speeding toward canajoharie thrilled
with joy at thought of all that now surely
lay before him

   ive beaten sam and mac to it any-
how thought he as he sank far down
in the last seat of the gloomy smoker
with one of the train-butchers flor de
garbagios in his mouth  beaten em
to a fine pulp theyll have to do biz
with me now do i hold the big card
some

  beatified with golden visions of ma-
zuma revenge and sally he voyaged
swiftly westward the train was express
between all pairs of bars along the line
and so was easily outdistancing the con-
spirators before morning jenkins cal-
culated the reins of power would lie firm-
ly in his hands

  to make a short story shorter the
train deposited him in canajoharie at
 he supped frugally at a hot-dog
cart-for before going against the ever-
etts he felt the need of inner sustenance-
absorbed dogs coffee and information as
to the whereabouts of the canal all for
fifteen cents and soon thereafter was
standing amid barrels beside the water-
way peering hither and yon for some
glimpse of the victory

  nothing of the yacht was visible jen-
kinss gaze was attracted to a cheerful

little fire on the canal bank a hundred
yards away thither he repaired be-
side the fire sat a night-watchman in
charge of much building-material the
red glow was reflected from a shrewd
deep-wrinkled face as the watchman
looked up at sound of the question

   hello there havent lamped a
white yacht being towed through here
have you

   yacht the old man stirred the
fire with his boot  the victory you
mean

  thats it wheres it anchored
asked jenkins eagerly

   anchored why-she aint an-
chored at all reckon youre kind of a
stranger round here aint you but shes
snubbed up bout a half mile below he
nodded the direction

   thanks said jenkins and started
away then struck by another thought
he returned  you arent wise to whether
anybodys grabbed off that job they were
advertising are you

   dunno what kind of a job

   mate

  the watchman regarded jenkins a long
minute then slowly shook his head

   better not sonny said he  bet-
ter not

   better not what demanded jen-
kins piqued

   better not try to sign articles as mate
a lad that calls a yacht  it an thinks
they anchor in the erie would only be
gettin in trouble take an old-time blue-
water mans advice sonny an dont do
it can you box the compass

   box it queried jenkins  sure
   howd you do it

   well id have to have a box and a
hammer and nails of course to begin
with and then-

  jenkins hesitated at sight of the watch-
mans startled expression something
seemed to tell him he was on the wrong
track

   no i dont mean just that he
amended but the old man still more
sad put another question
bill jenkins buccaneer	

   whats the duties of a mate any-
how

  a mate why-a mate-a mates a
kind of companion everybody knows
that said jenkins  he sort of acts as
a-a companion -for the captain and-
 and stays in the companionway is
that it suggested the watchman

  sure jenkins grasped eagerly at
this saving straw now for sure he was
getting some valuable tips that would
stand him in good stead when he should
confront the everetts  thats just
what i was going to say

   sonny can you run a hay-burner
the old mans question was shot out
with startling abruptness taken aback
jenkins found no answer save

  hay-burner whats that new
kind of engine

   oldest in the world sonny none
older some calls em mules but on the
canal theyre hay-burners can you run
one or mebbe two

   why sure whats the idea

   well my advice to you as a father
is to get a job runnin hay-burners an
not try to sign no mates berth you
aint got no more show fer that my boy
than what youd have to be a-well a
pirate on the canal so-

  startled jenkins turned a shade or
two paler the reference to piracy seemed
to be striking indelicately close what
might or might not this singular old man
know about him with plots and coun-
ter-plots weaving all about with detec-
tives pursuing the victory whom could
he trust he longed to be gone but
the watchman put another question

   when you was to home sonny what
counter did you work at

  i worked in a cigar-store blurted
jenkins indignantly

   i thought so well and the watch-
man nodded gravely  well now if
youve set your heart on a floatin job
you go ask fer a berth as storekeeper
you might just happen to make good
but claw off the lee shore of that mate
proposition claw off sonny

  silently jenkins stared at him a mo-
ment then without further speech de-
parted the old mans advice he real-
ized was sound even though it hurt
after all what mattered his official status
if only he could get aboard the yacht
any position even the most menial
would serve let the mate proposition
go welcome and hail to the job of ships
storekeeper

  greatly enheartened now and with
hopes fast rising in his emotional barom-
eter he strode along the canal in the di-
rection indicated by the old watchman
the fire faded and disappeared leaving
only a ruddy glow from behind the piles
of building-material

  at his left a row of dingy buildings
faintly showed under the light of a few
scattering arc-lamps that threw wimpling
serpents of illumination on the dark wa-
ters keenly jenkins peered ahead for
some sight of the victory only an oc-
casional scow or canal-boat was in sight
tied up to the bank or moving slowly be-
hind its tired span of mules discourage-
ment began to finger at his heart but all
of a sudden-

   gee there it is said our adven-
turer more cautiously advancing

  there indeed she was her trim white
hull and cabins gleaming vaguely in the
dim light aft under the awning which
still covered her deck an incandescent
was burning jenkins saw big wicker
chairs there and in the chairs two men

  he caught the dull glow of cigar-tips
and beheld a waft of smoke curses on
millionaires who sat in wicker chairs
aboard yachts smoking havanas at their
ease while their outraged victim pursued
them through dire perils jenkinss
heart beat loudly at thought of his be-
loved one now so near false to him or
true sally was almost within his reach
at last reward was near and venge-
ance ah pregnant and fateful mo-
ment

  gritting his teeth clenching both fists
and simply oozing outraged dignity jen-
kins came abreast the millionaires he

halted gazed at them a minute with ha-
tred and disdain how little they knew-
malcolm everett and his gray-mustached
father-who now stood within a few feet
of them how little they dreamed of their
impending fate then he raised his
voice and in tones not entirely steady
said

   good evening gents can i come
aboard on business

  malcolm everett peered out across the
narrow strip of water at the figure of a
young man in naval uniform who stood
there hand at round cap in a salute and
queried

   what business

   private matter sir

   all right he gestured toward the
gang-plank-the very same up which si-
moon sam ages and ages ago had kicked
him in such a dastardly fashion jen-
kins needed no second invitation a mo-
ment later he was confronting them both
under the gleam of the bulb

  outwardly bold our adventurer was in-
wardly quaking now for the first time
since having left hendersons cigar-stand
he was face to face with malcolm ever-
ett  would he be recognized would all
his plans in one second be shattered to
dust all his hopes be blighted nay not
so never a glint of recognition ap-
peared in the eyes of the heavily built
black-browed man in the big wicker chair
instead with a look of casual interest he
blew smoke and demanded

   well what is it

   i heard-saw your ad in the paper
began jenkins  but im not trying to
nail that job id like to connect with
your storekeeping department wages no
object any show

  a little silence greeted this rapid-fire
then the older man removing his cigar
asked simply

   have you ever kept store

    yes sir

   where

   on sixth avenue-i mean aboard
the henderson sir and-

   understand the duties perfectly

    yes sir do i cop the posish

   deserter queried malcolm

   no sir thats the uniform i had
when i expired

   when you what 

   i mean when i got through

  the two plutocrats exchanged a glance
of amusement that set jenkinss blood
boiling to be wronged robbed and
cast off to have ones sally stolen away
was it not enough without insult being
added for full measure only a gloating
inward realization of vengeance near at
hand restrained jenkins his heart was
seething in his breast but outwardly he
dissembled to perfection

   i dont know but we might take him
on judged malcolm  he seems an
original sort what do you think
father

   all right answered the other  go
forward and make arrangements with
burch i cant be bothered with these
petty details he dismissed jenkins with
a languid wave of the hand that turned
our adventurers insides to boiling lava
 now malcolm as i was saying he
continued totally ignoring the newly
hired employee  i figure that the sur-
plus production of pig-iron next year
will inevitably-

  waiting to hear no more but with a
seething welter of mingled rage and joy
struggling for mastery of his spirit jen-
kins saluted turned on his heel-as he
had seen sailors do in the movies-and
departed in quest of one burch unidenti-
fied

  how strange how passing strange it
seemed to be once more back on the vic-
tory jenkinss heart throbbed as he
passed a well-remembered place where
sally had stood with him when she had
shattered his dreams of foreign travel and
had told him he was really but in the
erie canal might he not at any mo-
ment come face to face with her might
not any wild entrancing romantic inci-
dent occur might not-

  jenkins paused a little aft of midships
from the side of a window-shutter au
bill jenkins buccaneer



most but not quite drawn a crack of light
was shining it seemed like sallys win-
dow was it not hers

  jenkins advanced half-resolved to
throw all caution to the winds to tap on
that shutter and like romeo of old have
sweet converse with his ladylove true
or false she was still his dulcinea for-
ever and a day

  a sharp metallic clink as of coins
dropping on metal arrested his attention
what might that be quickly he glanced
about nobody was visible he was
quite unobserved who hearing money
chinking will not look at it

  jenkins peered through the crack an
astonishing sight met his gaze there
seated at a table in a commodious cabin
not four feet from him sat cornelius
everett the millionaire who had first em-
ployed him

  in a flash he recognized the thin aris-
tocratic features the deep-set blue eyes
and aquiline nose but-but sally had
told him cornelius would not join the
tion which bade fair to last some time
victory till it had reached detroit

  what fresh deception plotting and
subterfuge was this jenkins knew not
he had no time now to ponder on the
dark mystery for right before him almost
within reach his widening eyes beheld a
profusion of wealth such as till then had
never gladdened them

  yes there sat the millionaire counting
out money by the wholesale nothing
retail about this clinking gold-pieces
dropped into a strong metal box at ever-
etts right hand beside the box lay
stacks of bills-yellow ones-all done up
in neat parcels with paper bands around
them oh it was fascinating it was daz-
zling superb divine

   suffering moses  thought jenkins
transfixed  the genuine elixir fun-drops
by the oceanful

  suddenly a voice spoke somewhere
within the millionaire raised his head
from the task and listened again the
voice

   all right said everett he arose

walked to a door at the side of the cabin
passed through it and disappeared

  instantly a wild tumult burst out in
jenkinss consciousness

  its mine a lot of that is mine
was the wild chorus that rang in his ears
these people had used him had profited
by his unpaid perils labors and tribula-
tions had cast him off cheated and
abused him robbed him of gold and love
and now visibly there before him lay a
fortune

  who could have resisted the obvious
and logical act of simple justice few of
us i know nor jenkins either ideas
of vengeance faded let sam and mac
handle their own case in their own way
here was wealth the girl once pos-
sessed of his rightful dues jenkins knew
he could achieve her here here was the
one immediate and crying essential

  how much ah that was the ques-
tion how much should he take jen-
kins was no thief he didnt want a
penny that didnt rightfully belong to
him but on the other hand he didnt
mean to lose a penny that did at any
rate  was his very own and the
reward oh call that  at a
moderate estimate very well jenkins
with quivering heart dry mouth and
shaking body determined right then and
there to take  correct to a t

  but how determine the amount ob-
viously only one way was open he
must grab it all - all that he could-
quietly leave the yacht seek out a hiding-
place count off the correct sum and re-
turn the rest this was honest this was
fair this was simple plain every-day jus-
tice to work

  boldly as befitted a pirate w-ho knew
his rights and meant to uphold them with 
firm but honest exactitude our buccaneer
slid back the blind

  over the sill he leaned the table wras
within easy reach not a sound was to
be heard save a muffled interchange of
voice from the inner cabin in conversa-
tion which bade fair to last some time

  farther jenkins stretched himself he

elongated his rather spare frame like an
eel out went his arm his clutching
hand already he seemed to sense the
feeling of half a dozen packets of those
delicious yellowbacks stuffed into his
roomy blouse already his fingers were
about to close on them-

 here you what you doing here 
jenkins heard a harsh brutal shout in
his ear he felt a violent jerk his

blouse tore wide with the tremendous pull
that dragged him from the window spun
him round and sent him staggering
against the rail

  open-mouthed and wide-eyed he
stared up at a figure of black wrath tow-
ering above him

  up into a terrible and menacing face
he peered-the face of malcolm everett
his arch-enemy

iucks everything

sometimes it chases a man some-
times he trips over it sometimes it
buries him

  the queerest case of all round good
and bad luck i ever knew of happened
to a fellow i met in western australia
just after baileys reward started the big
rush

  i had been prospecting some gullies
about sixty miles southeast of hannans
that summer just making tucker and
tobacco out of a few fly specks and an
occasional ounce slug i had a pack-
horse plenty of rice and dried apples a
few tins of meat with enough salt water
two feet down in the clay pan to keep
my condenser going

  i didnt feel settled enough to hoist
my fly so slept in the open by the fire
i was a hatter didnt care for mates as

a rule and hadnt met any other pros-
pectors on foot horse or camel since i
had been out nobody seemed to want
that bit of australia

  one evening at tea a man came out of
the scrub with nothing on but ragged
trousers and fell down flat by the fire
his back was burned and blistered his
tongue thick and his bare feet were
bleeding i knew at once that hed been
doing a perish so without asking ques-
tions i poured some hot tea down his
throat and gave him a bit of damper

  he came to pretty quickly and wanted
to explain i saw he was a new chum
and told him to shut up you dont
have to apologize for what the bush has
done to you when youve lost your bear-
ings and your water bag then i threw
a couple of flour bags over him put a
log under his head and let him sleep
luck



  he was a little pasty-faced chap one
of the thousands baileys find had
brought over from the east poor devils
accustomed to streets and policemen
trying where men like me had failed for
twenty years a bushy would have
wanted a smoke first no matter how
parched he was i know i always did

  next morning he was still weak but
got up and helped me to blow up the
ashes his name was david baird and
he had been dry-blowing at the six mile
near hannans he had tented with
some mates who were working for wages
on the perseverance and walked to and
fro every day between there and his
claim-which was a duffer

  at first i couldnt make out how long
he had been lost he didnt seem to know
himself but afterward i reckoned he did
a three days three days without water
is enough for an old chunk of diorite like
me but to baird who had never before
in his life been a hundred yards away
from a bar or a water tap it was hell-
no it was westralia which is worse than
hell

  coming home to camp he had gone
astray and didnt meet sign or sight of
anything living till he fell by my fire

   wasnt there a track i asked

   yes but i missed it somehow he
said  i had been used to guide myself
by the sound of the boulder battery

  i knew the boulder battery it was
the first bit of mining machinery on that
field it was not a real battery with
stampers and mercury box and blankets
-there wasnt enough water to run one
of that kind-but a sort of dry mill that
ground up the quartz in a round hopper
the row it made used to scare the black
fellows it spoiled the bush i thought as
it interfered with your thinking but
baird used to the noise and the clatter
of a city liked it and took it as a com-
pass to steer him home to camp

  he didnt seem able to explain why it
failed him that night as he said he heard
it quite plainly he thought he must
have mistaken the direction of the sound

but why he couldnt tell the country
was flat with low scrub and nothing to
cause an echo and besides he had been
going by that battery for weeks

   anything wrong with your ears i
asked

   no i heard it all the time nearly
but somehow i couldnt come up to it-
it never got any nearer then the night
came-and i was frightened-and began
to run about in the dark and call out-
you know how it is

   i did

   my water bag tore on a branch so
i lost every drop of course i had
nothing to eat and had been hungry
when i left the claim i thought praps
i was walking in a circle and going round
and round that battery which kept up
its  tum-te-te-tum tum-te-te-tum  all
night so i stopped and made up my
mind for a night in the bush i couldnt
light a fire as i hadnt any matches

  the new chum again a bushman
wouldnt stir a yard from camp or mate
without feeling his pockets

   next morning i couldnt hear the
battery at all at first i started blazing
a trail on the trunks with my shovel
the country was different so i knew i
had wandered it wasnt the flat patches
of red soil and quartz gravel i was used
to but low hills of ironstone and thick
scrub i climbed the highest i could see
-and then i heard the battery again
just as if it was near by it was so loud

   but i couldnt see any tents or
smoke-nothing but bush and sky bush
and sky

  i never saw a chap who could talk so
much and drink so little he said all
that on one cup of tea but then he had
to stop the bush and the sky make a
man hold his tongue all you can do
is bite on your pipe and go through
with it and if you say anything make it
a prayer and its best to think that

  i got his tale straight when he told it
later as he did many times at first he
used to mix up the middle and the end-
what he did with what he dreamed-and


all-story weekly

always talked most of the things that
hurt him most of course hed been out
of his mind a bit as a man will when
he does a perish but i dont think baird
ever quite came back for some time

    i tried to steer by my shadow but
i couldnt always watch it it made my
neck stiff and i bumped into rocks ami
tripped over roots i remember once
stopping and laughing thinking how
funny it would be if i found gold-and
i jumped once and the battery went
harder than ever when i picked up a
piece of quartz with specks on it -

   but it wasnt gold it was blood and
i saw i had lost my boots and my feet
were bleeding i heard voices besides the
battery marys and the girls at home
that was in the night and i ran toward
them and thats when i fell and knocked
my head against a tree in the dark-

  so he rambled on telling his story in
bits  felt sorry for him but he didnt
have to tell me i had done it all myself
all except the battery i never heard of
that befoie

  i made him rest for a day or two
while i went fossicking and gaye him
some flour bags to make a shirt and a
hat and boots for himself he was a
willing little chap got to cleaning up the
camp boiling the billy and he knew how
to bake johnny-cake that didnt taste of
the ashes

  i liked him as much as i could like
any man living in my camp except that
he took too much sugar in his tea and
talked too much he told me all about
his wife and children way back across
the bight waiting for him to find their
fortunes - how he had borrowed money
and the money-lender made him take out
a life policy  that nearly stopped me
he said  for the doctor who examined me
said i had a nervous heart and mary
was afraid but he said the open-air life
would do me good

  of course like the rest he thought it
was a picnic i adivsed him to get a
storekeepers job in coolgardie and of-
fered to give him tucker and water to

go in-and a compass i dont think he
was afraid of die bush even after what
he had been through but lie wouldnt
hear of taking a job he had come to
find gold and find it he would

  thats where the luck comes in i
had seen a new chum fall down a hole
an old-timer had given up as a duffer
and strike it rich with his first shovelful
so i didnt argue with him maybe i
thought he would bring me luck he
was lucky in a way to tumble on me if
he hadnt the crows would have got him
by this so i told him we could be mates
till i had to go in for more tucker

  when i knew him better i found out
that if city fellows know nothing they
can learn quickly he had picked up how
to handle the dry-blowers dishes and oc-
casionally came back with a pennyweight
or so and always had tea ready when
i got home and bush tea at that not
ladies stuff

  he had grit too and actually per-
suaded me not to shift camp me a
battler of twenty years experience bred
to the game and bound to die of it he
said if one bit of the country is as good
as another as it is in the west where the
rotten volcanic gold comes anyhow with-
out run or lead wed stand a better
chance if we worked out one claim to
bed-rock before shifting to another

  praps i wasnt used to being talked
to so much praps id got some supersti-
tions of my own in my build that i didnt
know of anyhow we hung on

  one evening as i turned to the clear-
ing i heard his ax going he used it
still like a new chum letting the handle
slip through his fingers till his-palms
blistered i saw him stop dead still and
lift his head in the air

   what is it dave i said

   i thought i heard the battery again
he said

  i had a bad streak that day the gold
had been so fine the wind blew it away
so i was irritable

   drop that dave theres no battery
this side of hannans and never will be
luck



theres not enough gold round here to
stop a tooth

  he didnt answer me the bush and
me were teaching him to be quiet but all
through tea i could see he was listening
and it annoyed me as there was nothing
to listen to i thought he had forgotten
that battery dream of his and i didnt
like it coming back

  i didnt want a crazy man for a mate
its hard enough to keep sane oneself
without company stronger men than
this little home-bred clerk have thrown
up their hands to the bush back east
where theres water-sometimes-and the
trees are big and friendly and theres
life in the scrub ive seen men jump
up from a camp-fire raving just becausc
they couldnt stand it

  but in the west here where everything
is dead dry and thirsty with stunted
scrub hot sand and bald rock with dry
lakes and salt water you have to dig for
with never a beast or insect and the only
birds crows waiting for you to die its
harder still-and i was afraid for davie

  but he said nothing and we rolled
over in our blankets with our feet to the
fire as usual and slept next day i made
my find i knew it before i saw it
something tingled along my pick handle
the moment the point struck the quartz
gold and i ought to know each other
for twenty years through new guinea
chills queensland blacks and westralian
thirsts i had been looking for it-and we
knew each other

  i wasnt at all excited but just stood
looking at that opened outcrop of quartz
-and the jewelers shop inside i didnt
even rush round and pick up sticks to
peg out my claim there was no need
for that anyway as i dont believe there
was another prospector between us and
the southern ocean

   there will be batteries here all right
creswick old man was what woke me

  it was baird at my elbow he never
could get over the town habit of calling
me by my last name and he was shaking
my hand

   im glad of your luck said he

  i think i was glad to get angry on
purpose for a relief

    your luck   said  our luck
our luck

  then i cursed him from there to syd-
ney for thinking i would leave him out
of it only a town chap used to robbing
his mates for a living and calling it busi-
ness would have thought of it didnt
i give him my tucker didnt i call
him my mate wasnt that enough

  i believe id ha hit him if he was big
enough but i talked more than i had in
a year till we shook hands again then
we pegged out our acres and davie made
our sunday duff that night for tea

  well thats how we found the last
look mine

  we got our reward claim of course in
addition to the one we pegged out and
in a week ten thousand men were on the
ground creswick and baird were regis-
tered partners in the wardens office
creswick on the ground in charge as
resident manager with a full- crew to hold
it under the regulations and baird on
his way to adelaide to float the company
get capital and buy machinery

  when he came back three months later
with five teams tugging through the sand
he waved his new straw hat at me and
pointing to the wagons yelled  the bat-
tery creswick old man

  we soon had the machinery up and as
we had dug out piles of yellow-streaked
quartz by this time very soon the first
 tum-te-te-tum tum-te-te-tum  of the
last look battery was startling the crows
from the trees

   i told mary about my perish said
davie  and she was feeling very blue
about that time and praying a lot but i
suppose you dont believe that had any-
thing to do with it

   ill believe anything i said  now
for it was bairds luck that made
him do that perish bairds crazy dream
about his battery that brought him to
me and something praps as crazy in
myself that made me agree to stick on to


all-story weekly

that barren flat when all my prospecting
sense of twenty years said  youre a
damn fool get on

  baird in his assam silk suit the boys
used to guy pottered round the machinery
shed day and night he knew no more
about mechanics than a kitten does of
geology but in a week he had pumped
dan the engineer learned to run it him-
self and knew every crank valve screw
and nut

  he did all the business while i directed
the shifts his interest in mining stopped
at the battery and what tlie battery
crushed out he worried if the returns
dropped a pennyweight and when the
machinery was stopped to clean up-and
the real old quiet came over the bush-he
looked unhappy

  but the last look was like so many
westralian leads and soon began to peter
out the jewelers shop of the first few
feet dwindled down to little threads dying
out in the quartz looking mighty sick to
an old miner

  the reports home began to cause
trouble shares dropped we needed cap-
ital for development and it didnt come
and davie began to worry just like a
town chap

  but i didnt i knew those reefs and
had done fairly well out of this one and
if i lost some storekeeper would go
dividing mates with me and start me off
again

  but davie had never been broken in
he never had a knock-out besides i sup-
pose having a wife and girls does make
a difference

  one day i dragged him off from where
he was moping around the shaft and
took him off for a prospect like old times
we walked about six miles far away from
the tents neither saying a word with our
eyes on the ground as usual sometimes
stopping to feel the weight of a pebble
with our toes when he stopped with his
old listening look

   its going again he said

   it aint i answered  it aint
worth spending the water on the steam

for that low-grade ore and dan wouldnt
start her without orders

   was watching him and kriew he didnt
mean our battery

   you know what  mean he said
 its the one i heard before not ours

  i didnt get angry i had learned to
respect david baird he was a man
and i didnt know everything but i
was certain our battery had not been
started and there could be no other

   cant you hear it-cant you hear
it said davie

  there was only one thing to hear be-
sides davies voice-the dead thick si-
lence of the bush-that silence that is so
heavy that sometimes it seems to shriek
we both stood as still as the rocks davie
listening and me watching him

   its stopped now i heard it though
i heard it

  the way he said it made me feel queer
we walked back to camp and i ques-
tioned dan the engine fires had been
out and not even a hammer raised in the
shed when the men knocked off and
tumbled up from the shaft the foreman
told us the quartz had died out of the
diorite we didnt even have a reef now

  davie looked very white and troubled
i gave orders to start a drive next day
to try and catch the underlay and maybe
the reef would make again we sat down
to tea davie had drunk one cup when
he rose to his feet

   there it is again-cant you hear it
cant you

  he was all wrought up with his face
flushed and he caught hold of me and
shook me as though to make me hear it
 tried to but heard nothing he wanted
to go out but i held him i didnt want
the men to see our manager like this he
semed really crazy

   cant you hear it its louder than
ever-tum-te-te-tum tum-te-te-tum-
in a flash i understood i was pushing
him back into the tent and i could feel
his heart beating hard against my hand
and i remembered what his doctor had
said
luck



   davie old man i said  its the
beating of your own heart youve been
hearing all the time

  i should never have said it ill al-
ways feel i killed him for he just slipped
his hand under his shirt to feel for him-
self tried to smile and then dropped
down dead at my feet

  his battery had stopped for good

  we buried him next day i picked out
the grave where we ended our last walk

  i thought it all out the weak heart
that raced with excitement or exertion
the weak heart that was the plucky heart
that hung on to what it wanted

  we made a coffin out of packing cases
and spread over it our only flag the aus-
tralian red ensign with the southern
cross and six men carried him slowly
through the bush

  as we came near the grave i heard
voices and saw men running and picking
up sticks as they ran the bearers began
to get fidgety a man passed saying they

had struck a new reef richer than the
last look

  there was an excited crowd round the
grave where a few feel below the subsoil
the diggers had struck quartz and their
shovels had scraped the gold till it shone

   boys i said i take possession of
this for the heirs of david baird

  we didnt bury him there of course
but on top of a big ironstone hill with a
twisted tree for his monument where his
wife and daughters came later and heard
the batteries of the new mine-the beat-
ing heart mine-and i fancied davie
himself was there listening too

  some of the boys tried to jump the
claim on priority but the warden at cool-
gardie upheld me digging a grave was
mining and besides i swore i pegged it
out first

  i showed my pegs to prove it-jam-
tins stuck there in the night when i
crawled round like a black feller to do it
to save the beating heart for my old
mates family

chapter xv

how henri mentone rode

it was eight oclock - the clock was
striking in the kitchen-as raymond
entered the presbytere again he
stepped briskly to the door of the front
room opened it and paused no before
going in there to wait it would be well
first to let mme lafleur know that he
was back to establish the fact that it

was after his return that the man had
escaped that his evening walk could in
no way be connected with what would set
st marleau by the ears in the morning

  and so he passed on to the dining-
room which mme lafleur used as a sit-
ting-room as well she was sewing beside
the table-lamp

   always busy madame  he called
out cheerily from the threshold  well
and has mile valerie returned

the sin that was his



   ah it is you monsieur le cure  she
exclaimed dropping her work on her
knees  and did you enjoy your walk
no valerie has not come back here yet
though i am sure she must have got back
to her uncles by now did you want her
for anything monsieur le cure-to write
letters  can go over and tell her

   but no-not at all said raymond
hastily he indicated the rear roomwith
an inclination of his head  and our
pauvre there

  mme lafleurs sweet motherly face
grew instantly troubled

   you can hear him tossing on the bed
for yourself monsieur le cure i have
just been in to see him he has one of
his bad moods he sad he wanted noth-
ing except to be left alone but i think
he will soon be quiet poor man he is
so weak he will be altogether exhausted
-it is only his mind that keeps him rest-
less

  raymond nodded

   it is a very sad affair he said slow-
ly  a very sad affair he lifted a fin-
ger and shook it playfully at mme la-
fieur  but we must think of you too-
eh do not work too late madame 
she answered him seriously  only to
finish this monsieur le cure see it is an
altar-cloth-for next sunday she held
it up  it is you who work too hard
and too late

  it was a cross on a satin background
he stared at it it had been hidden on
her lap before he had not been think-
ing of-a cross for the moment assured
of henri mentones escape he had been
more light of heart than at any time since
he had come to st marleau and for the
moment he had forgotten that he was a
meddler with holy things that he was-
a priest of god

  it seemed as though this were being
flaunted suddenly now as a jeering re-
minder before his eyes and with it he
seemed as suddenly to see the chancel
the altar of the church where the cloth
was to play its part-and himself kneel-
ing there-and curse the vividness of it

he heard his own lips at their sacrilegious
work  lavabo inter innocentes manus
meas et circumdabo altare tuum dom-
ine i will wash my hands among the
innocent and i will compass thine al-
tar o lord

  and so he stared at this cross she held
before him fighting to bring a pleased
and approving smile to the lips that
fought in turn for their right to snarl a
defiant mockery

   ah you like it monsieur le cure 
cried mme lafleur happily  i am so
glad

  raymond smiled for answer and went
from the room

  in the front room he lighted the lamp
upon his desk and stood there looking
down at the two letters that still awaited
the signature of-frangois aubert  i
will wash my hands among the innocent 
-he raised his hands and they were
clenched into hard and knotted fists

 words words they were only
words and what did their damnable in-
sinuations matter to him others might
listen devoutly and believe as he
mouthed them in his surplice and stole-
but for himself they were no more than
the mimicry of sounds issuing from a
parrots beak

  it was absurd then that they should
affect him at all he would better laugh
and jeer at them and all this holy en-
tourage with which he cloaked himself
for these things were being made to serve
his own ends were being turned to his
own account and-it was three-ace ar-
tie now and he laughed hoarsely under
his breath-for once they were proving
of some real and tangible value mme
lafleur and her cross and her altar
cloth he laughed again

  well while she vas busy with her
churchly task that she no doubt fondly
believed would hurry her exit through the
purgatory to come he would busy himself
a little in getting as speedily as possible
out of the purgatory of the present

  these letters now while he was wait-
ing and there was an opportunity he


all-story weekly

would sign them it would be easier to
say that he had decided not to make any
changes in them after all than to have
new ones written and then have to find
another opportunity for signing the lat-
ter he reached for the prayer-book to
make a tracing of the signature that was
on the fly-leaf-and suddenly drew back
his hand and stood motionless listening

  from the road came the rumble of
wheels the sound grew louder the
vehicle passed by the presbytere going in
the direction of tournayville the sound
died away

  still raymond listened even more in-
tently than before jacques bourget did
not own the only horse and wagon in st
marleau but bourget was to turn around
a little way down the road and return to
the church

  a minute two passed another and
then raymond caught the sound of a
wheel-tire rasping and grinding against
the body of a wagon as though the latter
were being turned in a narrow space-
then presently the rattle of wheels again
coming back now toward the church and
now by the church he heard the wagon
turn in from the road

  raymond relaxed from his strained at-
titude of attention jacques bourget it
was quite eyident intended to earn the
balance of his money well for a word
then between pierre desforges and
jacques bourget-pending the time that
mme lafleur and her altar-cloth should
go to bed the letters could wait

  he moved stealthily and slowly across
the room mme lafleur must not hear
him leaving the house he would be
gone only a minute-just to warn bour-
get to keep very quiet and to satisfy the
man that everything was going well he
could strip off his soutane and leave it
under the porch

  cautiously he opened the door an inch
at a time that it might not creak and
stepped out into the hall on tiptoe-and
listened mme lafleurs rocking-chair
squeaked back and forth reassuringly
she had perhaps had enough of her altar-

cloth for a while how could one do fine
needlework-and rock and why that
fanciful detail to flash across his mind

  and-his face was suddenly set his
lips tight-drawn together-what was this
these footsteps that had made no sound
in crossing the green but were quick and
heavy upon the porch outside he drew
back upon the threshold of his room

  and then the front door was thrust
open and in the doorway was m du-
pont the assistant chief of the tournay-
ville police and behind him was another
man and behind the man was-yes-
it was valerie

   tiens cre nom dtin chien 
clucked m dupont  ha monsieur le
cure you heard us-eh but you did
not hear us until we were at the door-
and a man posted at the back of the
house by that window there eh no
you did not hear us well we have
nipped the little scheme in the bud eh

  dupont knew raymonds hand tight-
ened on the door jamb-and as once be-
fore his other hand crept in under his
crucifix and under the breast of his sou-
tane to his revolver

   i do not understand -he spoke de-
liberately gravely  you speak of a
scheme m dupont i do not under-
stand

  ah you do not understand-du-
ponts face screwed up into a cryptic
smile  no of course you do not under-
stand well you will in a moment but
first we will attend to m henri mentone
now then marchant  - he addressed
his companion and pointed to the rear
room- that room in there and hand-
cuff him to you you had better stay
where you are monsieur le cure come
along marchand

  dupont and his companion ran into
henri mentones room raymond heard
mme lafleur cry out in sudden conster-
nation it was echoed by a cry in henri
mentones voice but he was looking at
valerie who had stepped into the hall
she was very pale

  what had she to do with this what
the sin that was his



did it mean had she discovered him
and-no dupont would not have rushed
away in that case but then-

  his lips moved

  you-valerie how very pale she
was-and how those dark eyes deep with
something he could not fathom sought
his face only to be quickly veiled by
their long lashes

   do not look like that monsieur le
cure-as though i had done wrong she
said in a low hurried tone  i am sorry
for the man too but the police were to
have taken him away to-morrow morning
in any case and if i went for m du-
pont to-night itwas-

   you went for m dupont-he re-
peated her words dazedly as though he
had not heard aright it was you who
brought dupont here just now-from
tournayville but-but i do not under-
stand at all

   valerie valerie  - mme lafleur
pale and excited rushed to her daugh-
ters side valerie speak quickly
what are they doing what does all this
mean

  valeries arm stole around her mother
 i-i was just telling father aubert
mother she said a little tremulously
 you-you must not be nervous see
it was like this you had just taken the
man for a little walk about the green this
afternoon-you remember when i
came out of the house a few minutes later
to join you i saw what i thought looked
like some money sticking out from one
end of a folded-up piece of paper that
was lying on the grass just at the bottom
of the porch steps i was sure of course
that it was only a trick my imagination
was playing me but i stooped down and
picked it up it was money a great deal
of money andlhere was writing on the
paper i read it and then i was afraid
it was from some friend of that mans in
there and was a plan for him to make
his escape to-night

   escape-mme lafleur drew closer
to her daughter as she glanced apprehen-
sively toward the rear room

  duponts voice floated menacingly out
into the hall-came a gruff oath from his
companion-the sound of a chair over-
turned - and henri mentones cry
pitched high

  in a curiously futile way raymonds
hand dropped from the breast of his sou-
tane to his side valerie and her mother
seemed to be swirling around in circles in
the hall- before him he forced himself
to speak naturally

   and then

  valeries eyes were on her mother

   i did not wantto alarm you mother
she went on rapidly  and so i told you
i was going for a drive i ran to uncles
house he was out somewhere i could
go as well as any one and if henri men-
tone had a friend lurking somewhere in
the village there would be nothing to
arouse suspicion in a girl driving alone
and besides i did not know who this
friend might be and i did not know
whom to trust i told old adele that i
wanted to go for a drive and she helped
me to harness the horse

  and now as raymond listened those
devils that had chuckled and screeched
as the lumpy earth had thudded down on
the lid of theophile blondins coffin
were at their hell-carols again it was
not just luck just the unfortunate turn
of a card that the man had dropped the
money and the note it was more than
that it seemed to hold a grim signifi-
cant premonition-for the future

  those devils did well to chuclde strug-
gle as he would they had woven their net
too cunningly for his escape

  it was those devils who had torn his
coat that night in the storm as he had
tried to force his way through the woods
it was his coat that henri mentone was
wearing he remembered now that the
lining of the pocket on the inside had
been ripped across it was those devils
who had seen to that-for this-know-
ing what was to come a finger seemed
to wag with hideous jocularity before his
eyes-the finger of fate

  he looked at valerie it was nothing


all-story weekly

for her to have driven to tournayville
she had probably done it a hundred times
before but it seemed a little strange that
henri mentones possible escape should
have been apparently so intimate and
personal a matter to her

   you were afraid you said mile va-
lerie he said slowly  afraid-that he
would escape

  she shook her head - and the color
mounted suddenly in her face

   of what then he asked

  -of what was in the note she said
in a low voice  i knew i had time for
nothing was to be done until the presby-
ter e was quiet for the night but the plan
then was to-to put you out of the way
and-

  his voice was suddenly hoarse

   and you were afraid-for me it
was for me that you have done this

  she did not answer the color was
still in her cheeks-her eyes were lowered

  the blessed saints cried mme la-
fleur crossing herself  the devils
they would do harm to father aubert
well i am sorry for that man no longer
he-

  they were coming along the hall-
henri mentone handcuffed to duponts
companion and dupont himself in the
rear

  monsieur le cure henri mentone
called out wildly  monsieur le cure do
not-

 enough hold your tongue
snapped dupont giving the man a push
past raymond toward the front door
 do you appeal to monsieur le cure be-
cause he has been good to you-or be-
cause you intended to knock him on the
head to-night bah hurry him along
marchand dupont paused before va-
lerie and her mother you will do me
a favor mesdames a very great favor
-yes you will retire instantly to bed-
instantly i have my reasons yes that
is right-go at once he turned to ray-
mond  and you monsieur le cure you
will wait for me here eh yes you will
wait i will be back on the instant

  the hall was empty in a subcon-
scious sort of way raymond stepped back
into his room and reaching the desk
stood leaning heavily against it his
brain would tolerate no single coherent
thought valerie had done this for fear
of harm to him valerie had-there was
jacques bourget who if he attempted
now to-it was no wonder that henri
mentone had been restless all evening
knowing that he had lost the note and
not daring to question-the day after to-
morrow there was to be a trial at the
criminal assizes- valerie had not met his
eyes but there had been the crimson
color in her face and she had done this
to save him - were they still laughing
those hell-devils-were they now engaged
in making valerie love him and making
her torture her soul because she was so
pure that no thought could strike her
more cruelly than that love should come
to her for a priest

  ah his brain was logical now his
hands clenched and unclenched and
clenched again impotent fury was upon
him

  if it were true damn them to the
everlasting place from whence they came
but it was not true it was but another
trick of theirs to make him writhe the
more-to make him believe she cared

  a footstep he looked up dupont
was back

   tiens  he cried  well you have
had an escape monsieur le cure an
escape yes you have but i do not
take all the credit no i do not she is
a fine girl that valerie lafleur if she
were a man she would have a career-
with the police i would see to it but
you do not know yet what it is all about
monsieur le cure eh

   there was a note and money that
mile valerie said she found -ray-
monds voice was steady composed

   zut  m dupont laid his forefinger
along the side of his nose impressively
 that is the least of it there is an ac-
complice-two of them in it you would
not have thought that eh monsieur le
the sin that was his	m



cure no you would not very well
then-listen i have this mentone safe
and now i dupont will give this accom-
plice a little surprise there will be the
two of them at the trial for the murder of
theophile blondin the grand jury is
still sitting you understand monsieur
le cure yes you are listening

   i am listening said raymond
giavely - and instinctively glanced to-
ward the window it might still have
been jacques bourget who had turned
down there on the road or if not then
the man would be along at any minute
in either case he must find some way to
warn bourget iam listening m du-
pont he said again  you propose to
lay a trap for this accomplice

    it is already laid announced m
 dupont complacently  they will dis-
 cover with whom they are dealing i re-
 turned at once with mile valerie i
 brought two men with me but you will
 observe monsieur le cure that i did not
 bring two teams-nothing to arouse sus-
 picion-nothing to indicate that i was
 about to remove our friend mentone to-
 night it would be a very simple matter
 to secure a team here when i was ready
  for it you see monsieur le cure yes
 you see very well my plans worked
 without a hitch

   just as we approached the church we
 met a man named jacques bourget driv-
 ing alone in a buckboard nothing could
 be better it was excellent i stopped
 him i requisitioned him and his horse
 and his wagon in the name of the law i
 made him turn around and told him to
 follow us back here after a few minutes
 you see monsieur le cure yes you see
 m jacques bourget is now cm his way to
 toumayville with one of my officers and
 the prisoner

   raymonds fingers were playing non-
 chalantly with the chain of his crucifix
 raymonds face was unmoved it was
 really funny was it not no wonder
 those denizens of hell were shrieking with
 abandoned glee in his ears this time
 they had a right to be amused it was

 really very funny-that jacques bourget
 should be driving henri mentone away
 from st marleau well now-what

   you are to be congratulated m du-
pont he murmured  but the accom-
plice-the other one who is still at
large

  ah the other one said dupont
and laid his hand confidentially on ray-
monds arm  the other-heh mon
dieu monsieur le cure but you wear
heavy clothes for the summertime

  it was the bulk of the sacristans old
coat there was a smile in raymonds
eyes a curious smile as he searched the
others face one could never be sure
of m dupont

   a coat always under my soutane in
the evenings -raymonds voice was
tranquil and be did not withdraw his
arm

  a coat-yes-of course dupont
nodded his head  why not well
then the other-listen all has been
done very quietly no alarm raised
none at all i have sent mme lafleur
and her daughter to bed the plan was
that the accomplice should come to the
back window for mentone but they
would not make the attempt until late- -
until all in the village was quiet that
is evident is it not yes it is evident
very good you sleep here in this room
monsieur le cure yes well you too
will put out your light and retire at once

   i will go into mentones room and
wait there in the dark for our other friend
to come to the window i will be henri
mentone you see yes you see it
is simple is it not yes it is simple
before morning  will have the man in a
cell alongside of henri mentone do
you see any objections to the plan mon-
sieur le cure

   only that it might prove very dan-
gerous-for you said raymond soberly
 if the man who is certain to be a des-
perate character attacked you before
you-

   dangerous bah  exclaimed m
dupont  that is part l my business


all-story weekly

i do not consider that i have my other
officer outside there now by the shed as
soon as the man we are after approaches
the window the officer will leap upon him
and overpower him and now monsieur
le cure to bed-eh and the light out
at once agreed raymond and

i	wish you every success m dupont
if you need help you can call or if you
like i will stay in there with you

   no no-not at all dupont moved
toward the door  it is not necessary
nothing can go wrong we may have to
wait well through the night and there is
no reason why you should remain up
too tiens fancy imagine did i
not tell you that mentone was a hardened
rascal two of them well we will see
if the second one can remember any bet-
ter than the first the light monsieur
le cure-do not forget he will not
come while there is a sound or a light
about the house dupont waved his
hand and the door closed on him

  raymond still leaning against the
desk heard the other walk along the hall
and enter the rear room - and then all
was quiet he leaned over and blew out
the lamp nothing must be allowed to
frustrate m duponts plans

  and then in the darkness for a long
time raymond stood there and think-
ing of duponts dangerous vigil in the
other room he laughed and thinking of
valerie he knew a bitter joy and think-
ing of henri mentone his hands knotted
at his sides and his face grew strained
and drawn

  and after that long time was past he
fumbled with his hands outstretched be-
fore him like a blind man feeling his way
and flung himself down upon the couch

chapter xvi

 for the murder of -

they sat on two benches by them-
selves the witnesses in the trial of
henri mentone for the murder of
theophile blondin on one side of ray-

mond was valerie on the other was
mother blondin and there was labbee
the station-agent and m dupont and
dr arnaud

  on the other bench were several of the
villagers and two men raymond did not
know and another man a crown sur-
veyor who had just testified to the dif-
ference in time and distance from the sta-
tion to mme blondins as between the
road and the path-thus establishing for
the prosecution the fact that by following
the path there had been ample oppor-
tunity for the crime to have been com-
mitted by one who had left the station
after the cure had already started toward
the village and yet still be discovered by
the cure on the road near the tavern

  the counsel appointed by the court
for the defense had allowed the testimony
to go unchallenged it was obvious it
did not require a crown surveyor to an-
nounce the fact-even an urchin from st
marleau was already aware of it the
villagers too had testified they had
testified that mme blondin had come
running into the village screaming out
that her son had been murdered and
that they had gone back with her to her
house and had found the dead body lying
on the floor

  it was stiflingly hot in the court-room
and it was crowded to its last available
inch of space there were many there
from tournayville-but there was all of
st marleau it was st marleaus own
and particular affair since early morn-
ing raymond had seen and heard
vehicles of all descriptions rattling past
the presbytere the occupants dressed in
their sunday clothes it was a jour de
fete st marleau did not every day
have a murder of its own the fields
were deserted only the very old and the
children had not come

  they were not all in the room for
there was not place for them all-those
who had not been on hand at the open-
ing of the doors had been obilged to con-
tent themselves with gathering outside to
derive what satisfaction they could from
the sin that was his



their proximity to the fateful events that
were transpiring within

  they had at least seen the prisoner led
handcuffed from the jail that adjoined
the court-house and had been rewarded
to the extent of being able to view with
bated breath and intense interest people
they had known all their lives such as
valerie and mother blondin and the
more privileged of their fellows who had
been chosen as witnesses as these latter
disappeared inside the building

  raymonds eyes roved around the
court-room and rested upon the judge
upon the bench his first glance taken
at the moment the judge had entered the
room had brought a certain quick re-
lief far from severity the white-haired
man sitting there in his black gown had
a kindly genial face he found his first
impressions even strengthened now

  his eyes passed on to the crown prose-
cutor and here too he found cause for
reassurance the man was middle-aged
shrewd-faced and somewhat domineer-
ing he was crisp incisive and had been
even unnecessarily blunt and curt in his
speech and manner so far-he was not
one who would enlist the sympathy of a
jury

  on the other hand - raymonds eyes
shifted again to hold on the clean-cut
smiling face of the prisoners counsel
lemoyne that was the lawyers name he
had been told was young pleasant-
voiced magnetic raymond experienced
a sort of grim admiration as he looked
at this man no one in the court-room
knew better than lemoyne the hopeless-
ness of his case and yet he sat there con-
fident smiling undisturbed

  raymonds eyes sought the floor it
was a foregone conclusion that the verdict
would be  guilty there was not a
loophole for defense but they would
not hang the man he clung to that
lemoyne could at least fight for his life
they would not hang a man who could
not remember

  they had beaten him raymond night
before last and at first he had been like

a man stunned with the knowledge that
his all was on the table and that the
cards in his hand were worthless - and
then had come a sort of philosophical
calm the gamblers optimism-the hand
was still to be played they would sen-
tence mentone for life and-well there
was time enough in a lifetime for another
chance

  somehow - in some way - he did not
know how-but in some way he would see
that there was another chance he
would not desert the man

  again he raised his eyes but this time
as though against his will as though they
were impelled and drawn in spite of him-
self across the room that was ray-
mond chapelle alias arthur leroy alias
three-ace artie alias henri mentone
sitting there in the prisoners box at
least that gaunt thin-faced haggard man
there was dressed in raymond chapelles
clothes-and he francois aubert the
priest the cure in his soutane with his
crucifix around his neck sat here among
the witnesses at the trial of raymond
chapelle who had killed theophile blon-
din in the fight that night

  one would almost think the man knew
how his eyes burned into him how they
tormented and plagued him they were
sad those eyes pitiful-they were help-
less-they seemed to seek him out as the
only friend among all these bobbing
heads and these staring gaping faces

   marcien labbee the clerks voice
snapped through the court-room he was
a fussy and important little man who
puffed his cheeks in and out and clawed
at his white side-whiskers

  the station-agent rose from the bench
entered the witness box and was sworn

  with a few crisp questions the crown
prosecutor established the time of the
trains arrival and the fact that the cure
and another man had got off at the sta-
tion the witness explained that the cure
had started to walk toward the village
before the other man appeared on the
platform

   and this other man  - the crown


all-story weekly

prosecutor whirled sharply around and
pointed toward henri mentone -  do
you recognize him as the prisoner at the
bar

  labbee shook his head

   it was very dark he said  i could
not swear to it

   his general appearance then his
clothes they correspond with what you
remember of the man

   yes labbee answered  there is
no doubt of that

   and as i understand it you told the
man that monsieur le cure had just
started a moment before and that if he
went at once he would have company on
the walk to the village

   yes

  	what did he say

   he said that he was not looking for
that kind of company

  there was a sudden curious restrained
movement through the court-room and
here and there a villager with pursed
lips nodded his head it was quite evi-
dent to those from st marleau at least
that such as henri mentone would not
care for the company of their cure

   you gave the man directions as to
the short cut to the village

   yes

   you may tell the court and the gen-
tlemen of the jury what was said then
labbee who had at first appeared a
little nervous now pulled down his vest
and looked around him with an air of
importance

   i told him that the path came out
at the tavern when i said  tavern he
was at once very interested i thought
then it was because he was glad to know
there was a place to stay-it was such a
terrible night you understand so i
told him it was only a name we gave it
and that it was no place for one to go
i told him it was kept by an old woman
who was an excommuniee and who made
whisky on the sly and that her son
was-

  miserable-it was mother blon-
din in a furious scream her eyes under

her matted gray hair glared fiercely at
labbee

  silence roared the clerk of the
court leaping to his feet

 raymonds hand closed over the
clenched bony fist that mother blondin
had raised and gently lowered it to her
lap

   he will do you no harm mme blon-
din he whispered reassuringly  and
see you must be careful or you will get
into serious trouble

  her hand trembled with passion in his
but she did not draw it away it was
strange that she did not it was strange
that he felt pity for her whn so much
was at stake when pity was such a trivial
and inconsequent thing this was a
murder trial a trial for the killing of this
womans son it was strange that he
should be holding the mothers hand and
-it was raymond who drew his hand
away he clasped it over his other one
until the knuckles grew white

  and then prompted the crown
prosecutor

   and then i do not remember how it
came about labbee continued  he
spoke of mme blondin having money-
enough to buy out any one around there
i said it was true that it was the gossip
that she had made a lot and that she
had a well-filled stocking hidden away
somewhere

   crapule mother blondins voice
if scarcely audible this time had lost
none of its fury

  the clerk contented himself with a
menacing gesture toward his own side-
whiskers the crown prosecutor paid no
attention to the interruption

   did the man give any reason for
coming to st marleau

   none

   did you ask him how long he in-
tended to remain

   yes he said he didnt know

   he had a traveling bag with him

   yes

   this one-the crown prosecutor
held up raymonds traveling bag
the  sin that was his



   i cannot say labbee replied  it
was too dark on the platform

   quite so but it was of a size suffi-
cient in your opinion to cause the man
inconvenience in carrying it in such a
storm so you offered to have it sent over
with monsieur le cures trunk in the
morning

   yes

   what did he say

 he said he could carry it all right
 he started off then with the bag
along the road toward st marleau

   yes

  the crown prosecutor glanced in-
quiringly toward the prisoners counsel
the latter shook his head

   you may step down m labbee
directed the crown prosecutor  call
mme blondin

  there was a stir in the court-room now
heads craned forward as the old woman
shuffled across the floor to the witness-
box mother blondin was quite capable
of anything - even of throwing to the
ground the holy book upon which the
clerk -would swear her

  mother blondin however did nothing
of the sort she gripped at the edge of
the witness-box mumbling at the clerk
and all the while straining her eyes
through her steel-bowed spectacles at the
prisoner across the room and then her
lips began to work curiously her face to
grow contorted-and suddenly the court-
room was in an uproar she was shaking
both scrawny fists at henri mentone and
screaming at the top of her voice

   that is the man that is the man 
-her voice became ungovernable in-
sensate it rose shrilly it broke it rose
piercingly again that is the man
the law the law i demand the law
on him he killed my son he did it
i tell you he did it he-

  chairs and benches wyere scraping on
the floor little cries of nervous terror
came from the women involuntarily men
stood up the better to look at both
mother blondin and the accused it was
a sensation it was something to talk

about in st marleau over the stoves in
the coming winter it was something of
which nothing was to be missed

  order silence order bawled
the clerk

  valerie had caught at raymonds
sleeve he did not look at her he was
looking at henri mentone - at the look
of dumb horror on the mans face - and
then at a quite different figure in the pris-
oners dock whose head was bent down
until it could scarcely be seen and whose
face was covered by his hands he tried
to force a grim complacence into his soui

  it was absolutely certain that he had
nothing to fear from the trial nothing
the other henri mentone the other
priest was answering for the killing of
that night and-who was this speaking
the crown prosecutor he had not
thought the man could be so suave and
gentle

   try to calm yourself mme blon-
din you have a perfect right to demand
the punishment of the law upon the mur-
derer of your son and that is what we
are here for now and that is why 
want you to tell us just as quietly as pos-
sible what happened that night

  everybody knows what happened
she snarled at him  he killed my son 

   how did he kill your son inquired
the crown prosecutor with a sudden
crafty note of skepticism in his voice
 how do you know he did

  i saw him i tell you i saw him
i heard my son shout  voleur  and cry
for help  - mother blondins words
would not come fast enough now  i
was in the back room when i opened
the door he was fighting my son he
tried to steal my money some of it
was on the floor my son cried for help
again i ran and got a stick of wood
my son tried to get his revolver from the
armoire this man got it away from him
i struck the man on the head with the
wood then he shot my son and i ran out
for help

   and you positively identify the pris-
oner as the man who shot your son


all-story weekly

   yes yes have i not told you so
often enough

   and this  - the crown prosecutor
handed her a revolver- do you identify
this

  yes it was my sons

   you kept your money in a hiding
place mme blondin  understand-in
a hollow between two of the logs in the
wall of the room is that so

  yes it is so mother blondins
voice grew shrill again  but i will find
a better place for it if i ever get it back
again the police are as great thieves as
that man they took it from him and
now they keep it from me 

   it is here mme blondin said the
lawyer soothingly opening a large en-
velope  it will be returned to you
after the trial how much was there

   i know very well how much  she
shrilled out suspiciously  you can-
not cheat me i know there were all
my savings years of savings-there was
more than five hundred dollars

  a little gasp went around the court-
room five hundred dollars it was a
fortune gossip then had not lied-it
had been outdone

   now this hiding-place mme blon-
din-you had never told any one about
it not even your son

   no

   it would seem then that this man
must have known about it in some way
had you been near it a short time
previous to the fight

   i told you i had didnt i i told
m dupont all that once mother blon-
din was growing unmanageable again
 i went there to put some money in not
five minutes before i heard my son call
for help

   your son then was not in the room
when you went to put this money away
 no of course he wasnt i have
told that to m dupont too i heard
him coming down-stairs just as i left the
room

   that is all mme blondin thank you
unless- the crown prosecutor turned

again inquiringly toward the counsel for
the defense

  lemoyne rose and standing by his
chair without approaching the witness-
box took a small penknife from his pocket
and held it up

   mme blondin he said gently  will
you tell me what i am holding in my
hand

  mother blondin squinted set her
glasses further on her nose and shook
her head

   i do not know she said

   you do not see very well mme
blondin   -sympathetically

  what is it you have got there-eh
what is it she demanded sharply

  lemoyne restored the penknife to his
pocket and smiled

   it is a penknife mme blondin-one
of my own an object that any one
would recognize-unless one did not see
very well are you quite sure mme
blondin-quite sure on second thoughts
-that you see well enough to identify
the prisoner so positively as the man who
was fighting with your son

  the jury with quick meaning glances
at one another with a new interest leaned
forward in their seats there was a tense
moment-a sort of bated silence in the
court-room and then as mother blon-
din answered some one tittered audibly
the spell was broken the point made by
the defense swept away turned even into
a weapon against itself

  if you will give me a stick of wood
and come closer close enough so that i
can hit you over the head with it said
mother blondin and cackled viciously
 you will see how well i can see

  mme blondin stepped down

  and then there came upon raymond
a thrill a weakness a quick tightening
of his muscles the clerk had called his
name he walked mechanically to the
witness-stand it was coming now he
must be on his guard but he had
thought out everything very carefully
and-no almost before he knew it he
was back in his seat again he bad been
the sin that was his



asked only if he had followed the road
all the way from the station to describe
how he had found the man and to iden-
tify the prisoner as that man

   he was to be recalled lemoyne had
not asked him a single question

   mile valerie lafleur called the
  clerk

    oh monsieur le cure she whispered
 tremulously  i-i do not want to go
 it-it is such a terrible thing to have to
 say anything that would help to send a
 man to death-i-

   mile valerie lafleur snapped the
 clerk  will the witness have the good-
 ness to-

   raymond did not hear her testimony
 he knew only that she too identified the
 man as the one she had seen lying un-
 conscious in the road and that the note
 she had found was read and placed in
 evidence-in his ears like a dull con-
 stant dirge were those words of hers with
 which she had left him- it is such a
 terrible thing to have to say anything
 that would help to send a man to death
 who was it that was sending the man
 to death not he he had tried to save
 the man it wasnt death anyway the
 mans guilt would appear obvious of
 course-lemoyne the lawyer could not
 alter that but he had still faith in le-
 moyne lemoyne would make his de-
 fense on the mans condition lemoyne
 would come to that

    my son croaked old mother blon-
 din fiercely at his side  my son what
 i know i know but the law-the law
 on the man who killed my son

   pull yourself togther you fool
rasped that inner voice  do you want
everybody in the court-room staring at
you listen to the incomparable du-
pont telling how clever he was

   yes dupont was on the stand now
dupont was testifying to finding the re-
volver and money in the prisoners pock-
ets he verified the amount dupont
had his case at his fingers tips and he
sketched it with an amazing conciseness
for m dupont from the moment he had

 been notified of the crime up to the time
 of the attempted escape he was con-
 vinced that in spite of all precautions
 the prisoners accomplice had taken alarm
 --since he dupont had sat the night in
 the room waiting for the unknowns ap-
 pearance and neither he nor his deputy
 who had remained until daylight hiding
 in the shed where he could watch the
 prisoners window had seen or heard any-
 thing

  on cross-examination he admitted that
pressure had been brought to bear upon
the prisoner in an effort to trip the man
up in his story but that the prisoner had
unswervingly held to the statement that
he could remember nothing

  the voices droned through the court-
room it was dr arnaud now identify-
ing the man they were always identi-
fying the man why did not he the
saintly cure of st marleau-no it was
three-ace artie-why did not he three-
ace artie laugh outright in all their
faces it was not hard to identify the
man he had seen to that very thor-
oughly more thoroughly than even he
had imagined that night in the storm
when all the devils of hell were loosed to
shriek around him and he had changed
clothes with a dead man

  a dead man-yes that was the way it
should have been did he not remember
how limply the mans neck and head
wagged on his shoulders and how the
body kept falling over in grotesque atti-
tudes instead of helping him to get its
clothes off only the dead man had
come-to life

  that was the man over there inside that
box with the little wood-turned decora-
tions all around the railing-no he
wouldnt look-but that man there who
was the color of soiled chalk and whose
eyes with the hurt of a dumb beast in
them kept turning constantly in this di-
rection over here here where the wit-
nesses sat

  dr arnaud -it was the counsel for
the defense speaking and suddenly ray-
mond was listening with strained atten-


all-story weekly

tionr-you have attended the prisoner
from the night he was found unconscious
in the road until the present time

   yes monsieur

   you have heard me in cross-examina-
tion ask mile lafleur and m dupont if
at any time during this period the pris-
oner by act manner or word swerved
from his statement that he could remem-
ber nothing either of the events of that
night or of prior events in his life you
have heard both of these witnesses testify
that he had not done so i will ask you
now if you are in a position to corrobor-
ate their testimony

   i am replied dr arnaud  he
has said nothing else to my knowledge
 then doctor in your professional
capacity will you kindly tell the court
and the gentlemen of the jury whether
or not loss of memory could result from
a blow upon the head

   it could-certainly stated dr ar-
naud  there is no doubt of that but
it depends on the-

   just a moment doctor if you please
we will come to that  - lemoyne as
raymond knew well that lemoyne him-
self was fully aware was treading on thin
and perilous ice but on lemoynes lips
as he interrupted was an engaging smile
 this loss of memory now will you
please help us to understand just what
it means take a hypothetical case
could a man for example read and write
do arithmetic say appear normal in all
other ways and still have lost the mem-
ory of his name his parents his friends
his home his previous state

   yes said dr arnaud  that is
quite true he might lose the memory
of all those things and still retain every-
thing he has acquired by education

   that is a medical fact

   yes certainly it is a well-known
medical fact

   and is it not also a medical fact doc-
tor that this condition has been known
to have been caused by a blow-i will
not say slight for that would be mislead-
ing-but by a blow that did not even

cause a wound and i mean by a wound
a gash a cut or the tearing of the flesh
yes that too is so

  lemoyne paused he looked at henri
mentone and suddenly it seemed as
though a world of sympathy and pity
were in his face he turned and looked
at the jury-at each one of the twelve
men but almost as though he did not
see them there was a mist in his eyes
it was silent again in the court-room
his voice was low and grave as he spoke
again

   dr arnaud are you prepared to
state professionally under oath that it is
impossible that the blow received by the
prisoner at the bar should have caused
him to lose his memory

   no dr arnaud shook his head
 no i would not say that

  lemoynes voice was still grave

   you admit then that it is possible
  the doctor hesitated

   yes he said  it is possible of
course

   that is all doctor lemoyne sat
down

  one moment-the crown prosecu-
tor crisp curt incisive was on his feet
 loss of memory is not insanity doc-
tor

   no

   is the prisoner in your professional
judment insane

   no declared dr arnaud emphatic-
ally most certainly not

  with a nod the crown prosecutor dis-
missed the witness

  a buzz whisperings ran around the
room raymonds eyes were fixed som-
berly on the floor relief had come with
lemoynes climax but now in dr ar-
nauds reply to the crown prosecutor he
sensed catastrophe

  a sentence for life was the best that
could be hoped for but but suppose-
suppose lemoyne should fail to secure
even that no no-they would not hang
the man even dr arnaud had been
forced to admit that he might have lost
his memory that would be strong
the sin that was his



enough for any jury and-they were call-
ing his name again and he was rising
and walking a second time to the witness-
stand

  surely all these people knew was not
his face set and white and drawn see
that ray of sunlight coming in through
that far window and how it did not devi-
ate but came straight toward him and
lay upon the crucifix on his breast to
draw all eyes upon it upon that figure
on the cross the man betrayed

  god he had not meant this he had
thought the priest already dead that
night it was a dead man he had meant
should answer for the killing of that ugly
scared-faced drunken blackguard theo-
phile blondin that couldnt do a dead
man any harm it was a dead man a
dead man a dead man-not this living
breathing one who-

  monsieur le cure said the crown
prosecutor  you were present in the
prisoners room with m dupont and dr
arnaud when m dupont made a search
of the accuseds clothing

   yes raymond answered

   do you identify this revolver as the
one taken from the prisoners pocket
what was it valerie had said-that it
was such a terrible thing to have to say
anything that would help to send a man
to death but the man was not going
to death it was to be a life sentence-
and afterward after the trial there would
be time to think and plot and plan

   it is the same said raymond in a
low voice

  you also saw m dupont take a
large number of loose bills from the pris-
oners pocket

   yes

   do you know their amount

   no m dupont did not count them
at the time

  there were a great many however
crumpled in the pocket as though they
had been hastily thrust there

   yes

  why did that man in the prisoners
dock look at him like that-not in ac-

cusation-it was worse than that-it was
in a sorrowful sort of wonder and a
numbed despair those devils were
laughing in his ears-he was telling the
truth

   that is all i think monsieur le cure
said the crown prosecutor abruptly

  all there came a bitter and abysmal
irony puppets all were puppets upon
a set stage-from the judge on the bench
to that dismayed thing yonder who wrung
his hands before the imposing majesty of
the law all that was all was it-
the few words he had said who then
was the author of every word that had
been uttered in the room who then had
pulled the strings that jerked these auto-
matons about in their every movement

  ah here was lemoyne this time the
prisoners counsel this time there was
to be a cross-examination yes certainly
he would like to help lemoyne but le-
moyne must not try to trap him le-
moyne too was a puppet and therefore
lemoyne could not be expected to know
how very true it was that  henri men-
tone  was on trial for his life and that
 henri mentone  would fight for that
life with any weapon he could grasp and
that lemoyne would do the prisoner an
ill turn to put  henri mentone  on the
defensive

  well-he brushed his hand across his
forehead and fixed his eyes steadily on
lemoyne-he was ready for the man

   monsieur le cure -lemoyne had
come close to the witness-stand and le-
moynes voice was soberly modulated-
 monsieur le cure i have only one ques-
tion to ask you you have been with
this unfortunate man since the night you
found him on the road you have nursed
him night and day as a mother would a
child you have not been long in st
marleau but in that time so i am told
and i can very readily see why you have
come to be called the good young father
aubert by all your parish

   monsieur le cure you have been con-
stantly with this man for days and nights
you have scarcely left his side and so i


all-story weekly

 come to the question that it seems to
 me you of all others are best qualified
 to answer

   lemoyne paused he had placed his
 two hands on the edge of the witness-
 box and was looking earnestly into ray-
 monds face

    monsieur le cure do you believe that
 when the prisoner says that he remem-
 bers nothing of the events of that night
 that he has no recollection of the crime
 of which he is accused-do you believe
 monsieur le cure that he is telling the
 truth

   there had been silence in the court-
 room before-it was a silence now that
 seemed to palpitate and throb a living
 silence instinctively the crown prose-
 cutor had made as though to rise from
 his chair and then as if indifferent had
 changed his mind no one else in the
 room had moved

   raymond glanced around him they
 were waiting-for his answer the word
 of the good young father aubert would
 go far lemoynes eyes were pleading
 mutely-for the one ground of defense
 the one chance for his clients life but
 lemoyne did not need to plead-for that
 they must not hang the man they
 were waiting-for his answer still the
 silence held

   and then raymond raised his right
 hand solemnly

    as god is my judge he said  i
 firmly believe that the man is telling
 the truth

   benches creaked there was the rustle
 of garments a sort of unanimous and in-
 voluntary long-drawn sigh and it seemed
 to raymond that as all eyes turned on
 the prisoner they held a kindlier and
 more tolerant light and then as he
 walked back to the other witnesses and
 took his seat he heard the crown prose-
 cutor speak-as though disposing of the
 matter in blunt disdain

     the piosecution rests

    valerie laid her hand over his

    i am so glad-so glad you said that
 she whispered

  m dupont leaned forward and clucked
his tongue very softly

   hah monsieur le cure he wagged
his head indulgently  well i suppose
you could not help it-eh no you
could not i have told you before that
you are too soft-hearted

  there were two witnesses for the de-
fense - dr amauds two fellow prac-
titioners in tournayville their testi-
mony was virtually that of dr arnaud
in cross-examination to each of them
the crown prosecutor put the same ques-
tion-and only one was the prisoner
insane each answered in the negative

  and then a moment later lemoyne
rising to sum up for the defense walked
soberly forward to the jury-box and halt-
ed before the twelve men

   gentlemen of the jury he began
quietly  you have heard the profes-
sional testimony of three doctors one of
them a witness for the prosecution who
all agree that the wound received by the
prisoner might result in loss of memory

  you have heard the testimony of ihat
good man the cure of st marleau who
gave his days and nights to the care and
nursing of the one whose life gentlemen
now lies in your hands you have heard
him declare in the most solemn and im-
pressive manner that he believed the pris-
oner had no remembrance no recollection
of the night on which the crime was com-
mitted who should be better able to
form an opinion as to whether as the
prosecution pretends the prisoner is play-
ing a part or as to whether he is telling
the truth than the one who has been with
him from that day to this and been with
him in the most intimate way more than
any one else

   and i ask you too to weigh well
and remember the character of the man
whom his people call the good young
father aubert who has so emphatically
testified to this effect his words were
not lightly spoken and they were pure in
motive you have heard other witnesses
-all witnesses for the defense gentlemen
-assert that they have seen nothing
the sin that was his



beard nothing that would indicate that
the prisoner was playing a part

   gentlemen every scrap of evidence
that has been introduced but goes to sub-
stantiate the prisoners story is it pos-
sible do you believe for an instant that
a man could with his first conscious
breath assume such a part and sick and
wounded and physically weak play it
through without a slip or sign or word
or act that would so much as hint at du-
plicity

   but that is not all gentlemen i
will ask you to come with me in thought
to a scene that occurred this morning an
hour before this trial began and i would
that the gift of words were mine to make
you see that scene as i saw it

  he turned and swept out his hand to-
ward the prisoner

   that man was in his cell on his knees
beside his cot he did not look up as i
entered and i did not disturb him we
were alone together there after a few
minutes he raised his head there was
agony in his face such as i have never
seen before on a human countenance i
spoke to him then  told him that pro-
fessional confidence was sacred i warned
him of the peril in which he stood i
pleaded with him to help me save his life
to tell me all everything not to tie my
hands

   gentlemen of the jury do you know
his answer it was a simple one-and
spoken as simply  when you came in i
was asking god to give me back my mem-
ory before it was too late that is what
he said gentlemen

  there were tears in lemoynes eyes-
there were tears in other eyes throughout
the court-room there was a cry in ray-
monds heart that went out to lemoyne
he had not failed he had not failed
lemoyne had not failed

   gentlemen he did not know le-
moynes voice rose now in impassioned
pleading-and he spoke on with that elo-
quence that is born only of conviction
and in the soul it was the picture of the
mans helplessness he drew the horror of

 an innocent man entangled in seemingly
 incontrovertible evidence and doomed to
 a frightful death he played upon the
 emotions with a master touch-and as the
 minutes passed sobs echoed back from
 every quarter of the room-and in the
 jury-box men brushed their hands across
 their eyes

   and at the end he was very quiet
 again and his words were very low

     gentlemen of the jury i believe in
 my soul that this man is innocent i ask
 you to believe that he is innocent i ask
 you to believe that if he could tell of the
 events of that night he would stand be-
 fore you a martyr to a cruel chain of cir-
 cumstance and i ask you to remember
 the terrible responsibility that rests upon
 you of passing judgment upon a man
 helpless impotent and alone and who
 deprived of all means of self-defense has
 only you to look to-for his life

   there was buoyancy in raymonds
 heart lemoyne had not failed he had
 been magnificent-triumphant even the
 judge was fumbling awkwardly with the
  papers on his desk what did it matter
 now what the crown prosecutor might
 say no one doubted perhaps that the
 man was guilty but the spell that le-
 moyne had cast would remain and there
 would be mercy

    a chill came a chill like death-if it
 were not so what would he have to face

    gentlemen of the jury -the crown
 prosecutor was speaking now- i should
 do less than justice to my learnedfriend
 if i did not admit that i was affected by
 his words but i should also do less than
 justice to the laws of this land to you
 and to myself if i did not tell you that
 emotion has no place in the consideration
 of this case and that fact alone must be
 the basis of your verdict

    i shall not keep you long i have
 only a few words to say the court will
 instruct you that if the prisoner is sane
 he is accountable to the law for his crime
 wte are concerned not with his loss of
 memory though my learned friend has
 made much of that but with his sanity


all-story weekly

the court will also instruct you on that
point

    i shall not therefore discuss the
question of the prisoners mental condi-
tion except to recall to your minds that
the medical testimony has been unanimous
in declaring that the accused is not in-
sane and except to say that in so far as
loss of memory is concerned it is plainly
evident that he was in full possession of
all his faculties at the time the murder
was committed andthat i am personally
inclined to share the opinion of his ac-
complice in crime-a man gentlemen
whom we may safely presume is even a
better judge of the prisoners character
than is the cure of st marleau - who
from the note you have heard read has
certainly no doubt that the prisoner is
not only quite capable of attempting such
a deception but is actually engaged in
practising it at the present moment

    i pass on to the facts brought out by
the evidence on the night of the crime
a man answering the general description
of the prisoner arrived at the st marleau
station it was a night when one and
especially a stranger would naturally be
glad of company on the three-mile walk
to the village the man refused the com-
pany of the curl

    why he as it later appears had
very good reasons of his own it was
such a night that it would be all one
would care to do to battle against the
wind without being hampered by a trav-
eling bag he refused the station-agents
voffer to keep the bag until morning and
send it over with the cures trunk

    why it is quite evident in view
of what followed that he did not expect
to be there the next morning

    he drew from the station-agent cor-
roborating presumably the information
previously obtained either by himself or
this unknown accomplice the statement
that mme blondin was believed to have
a large sum of money hidden away some-
where in her house that was the man
gentlemen who answers the general
description of the prisoner within ap-

proximately half an hour later mme
blondins house is robbed and in an
effort to protect his mothers property
theophile blondin is shot and killed

   the question perhaps arises as to how
the author of this crime knew the exact
hiding-place where the money was kept
but it is not material inasmuch as we
know that he was in a position to be in
possession of that knowledge he might
have been peering in through the window
when mme blondin as she testified was
at the hiding-place a few minutes before
he broke into her house-or his accom-
plice still unapprehended may already
have discovered it

   and now we pass entirely out of the
realm of conjecture you have heard the
testimony of the murdered mans mother
who both saw and participated in the
struggle the jrran who murdered theo-
phile blondin who was actually seen to
commit the act is identified as the pris-
oner at the bar he was struck over the
head by mme blondin with a stick of
wood which inflicted a serious wound

   we can picture him running from the
house after mme blondin rushed out
toward the village to give the alarm he
did not however get very far-he was
himself too badly hurt he was found
lying unconscious on the road a short
distance away again the identification
is complete-and in his pocket is found
the motive for the crime mme blondins
savings-and in his pocket is found the
weapon theophile blondins revolver
with which the murder was committed

   gentlemen i shall not take up your
time or the time of this court needlessly
no logical human being could doubt the
prisoners guilt for an instant i ask you
gentlemen to return a verdict in accord
ance with the evidence

  raymond did not look up as the crown
prosecutor sat down  no logical human
being could doubt the prisoners guilt for
an instant that was true wasnt it
no human being-save only one well
he had expected that-it was even a
tribute to his own quick wit
the sin that was his



  puppets yes puppets-they were all
puppets-all but himself but if there was
guilt there was dso mercy they would
show mercy to u man who could not
remember how many times had he said
that to himself well he had been right
hadnt he he had more reason to believe
it now than he had had to believe it be-
fore lemoyne had beyond the shadow
of a doubt convinced every one in the
court-room that the man could not re-
member

  order attention silence rapped
out the clerk pompously

  the judge had turned in his seat to face
the jury

   gentlemen of the jury he said im-
passively  it is my province to instruct
you in the law as it applies to this case
and as it applies to the interpretation of
the evidence before you there must be
no confusion in your minds as to the ques-
tion of the prisoners mental condition
the law does not hold accountable nor
does it bring to trial any person who is
insane the law however does not rec-
ognize loss of memory as insanity

   there has been no testimony to indi-
cate that the prisoner is insane or even
that he was not in an entirely normal
condition of mind at the time the crime
was committed there has been the testi-
mony of three physicians that he is not
insane you have therefore but one thing
to consider

   if from the evidence you believe
that the prisoner killed theophile blon-
din it is your duty to bring in a verdict
of guilty on the other hand the prisoner
is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable
doubt as to his guilt that may exist in
your minds you may retire gentlemen
for your deliberations

  there was a hurried whispered consul-
tation among the twelve men in the jury-
box it brought raymond no surprise
that the jury did not leave the room it
brought him no surprise that the figure
with the thin pale face who was dressed
in raymond chapelles clothes should be
ordered to stand and face those twelve

men and hear the word  guilty  fall
from the foremans lips

  he had known it every one had known
it-it was the judge now that white-
haired kindly-faced man upon whom he
riveted his attention

  a sentence for life-yes that was ter-
rible enough-but there was a way-there
would be some way in the days to come-
he had fastened this crime upon a dead
man to save his own life-not on this
living one whose eyes now he could not
meet across the room though he could
feel them upon him feel them staring
staring at his naked soul-he would find
some way-there wyould be time there
was all of time in a sentence for life-he
would not desert the man he would-

   henri mentone -the judge was
speaking again- you have been found
guilty bv a jury of your peers of the
murder of one theophile blondin have
you anything to say why the sentence of
this court should not be passed upon
you

  there was no answer what was the
man doing was he crying trembling
was there that old nameless horror in the
face were his lips quivering as a childs
lips quiver when it is broken-hearted

  raymond dared not look dared not
look anywhere now save at the white-
haired kindly-faced-yes he was kindly-
faced-judge and then suddenly he
found himself swaying weakly and his
shoulder bumped into old mother blon-
din

  not that-great god-not that that
kindly-faced man was putting a hack
hat on his head and standing up
everybody was standing up he too
was standing up only he was not steady
on his feet was valeries hand on his
arm in nervous terror or to support him
some one was speaking

  the words were throbbing through his
brain yes throbbing-throbbing and
clanging like hammer-blows-that was
why he could not hear them all

     the sentence of this court   
place of confinement    thence to the


all-story weekly

place of execution    hanged by the neck
until you are dead and may god have
mercy on your soul

 and then raymond looked and
through the solemn silence and through
the doom that hung upon the room there
came a cry it was henri mentone the
mans hands were stretched out the tears
were streaming down  his cheeks and
was this mockery-or a joke of hell
then why did not everybody howl and
scream with mirth the man was calling
upon himself to save himself

  no no-he raymond was going mad
to call it mockery or mirth it was
ghastly horrible pitiful beyond human
understanding it tore at the heart and the
soul-the man was doing what that
figure upon the cross had once been bade
to do-his own name was upon his own
lips he was calling upon himself to save
himself and the voice in agony rang
through the room and people sobbed

   father - father francois aubert
help me do not leave me i do not know
-i do not understand father-father
frangois aubert help me-i do not un-
derstand

  and raymond groping out behind him
flung his arm across the back of the
bench and sinking down his head fell
forward and his face was hidden

   tiens said mother blondin sullenly
as though forced to admit it against her
will  he has a good heart even if he is a
priest

chapter xvii

the common cup

it seemed as though it were an immeas-
urable span of time since that voice
had rung through the court-room he
could hear it yet-he was hearing it al-
ways  father-father francois aubert
-help me-i do not know-i do not
understand and sometimes it was
pitiful beyond that of any human cry
before and sometimes it was dominant
in its ghastly irony

  and yet that was only yesterday and
it was only the afternoon of the next day
now

  there were wild roses and wild rasp-
berries growing here along the side of the
road and the smoke wreathed upward
from the chimneys of the whitewashed
cottages and the water lapped upon the
shore-these things were unchanged un-
disturbed unaffected untouched it
seemed curiously improper that it should
be so-that the sense of values was some-
how lost

  he had come from the court-room with
his brain in a state of numbed shock as
it were like a wound that has taken the
nerve centers by surprise and had not yet
begun to throb it was instinct the in-
stinct to fight on the instinct of self-
preservation that had bade him grope his
way to lemoyne the counsel for the
defense

   i have friends who have money he
had said  appeal the case-spare no
effort-i will see that the expenses are
met

  and after that he had driven back to
st marleau and after that again he had
lived through a succession of blurred
hours obeying mechanically a sense of
routine-he had talked to the villagers
he had eaten supper with valerie and her
mother he had gone to bed and lain
awake he had said mass in the church
that morning-mass

  was it the heat of the day his brow
was feverish he took off his hat and
turned to let the breeze from the river
fan his face and head it was only this
afternoon a little while ago that he had
emerged from that numbed stupor and
now the hurt and the smarting of the
wound had come his brain was clear
now-terribly clear better that the
stupor which was a kindly thing had re-
mained 

 he had said mass that morning
 lavabo inter innocentes manus meas 
i will wash my hands among the inno-
cent in the sight of holy god he had
said that at gods holy altar as he had
the sin that was his



spoken symbolizing his words he had
washed hjs fingers jn water

  it had not seemed to matter so much
then he had even mocked cynically at
those same words the night that mme
lafleur had shown him the altar-cloth-
but that other voice those other words
had not been pounding at his ears then
as now and now they were joined to-
gether his voice and that other voice his
words and those other words  i will
wash my hands among the innocent--
hanged by the netk until you are dead
and may god have mercy on your soul

  he stood by the roadside hatless
through the open doorway of a cottage
a few yards away he could see old grand-
mother frenier who was exceedingly poor
and deaf and far up in the eighties con-
tentedly at work with her spinning-
wheel  the shore where the tide was
half out and the sand of the beach had
merged into oozy mud two barefooted
children overturned the rocks of such size
as were not beyond their strength laugh-
ing gleefully as they captured the sea-
worms whose nippers could pinch with
no little degree of ferocity and with
which later no doubt they intended to
fish for tommy-cods also there was sun-
light and sparkling water and some one
driving along the road toward him in a
buckboard and he could hear bouchard
in the carpenter-shop alternately ham-
mering and whistling-the whistling was
out of tune it was true but what it lacked
in melody it made up in spirit 

  this was reality this was actuality
happiness and peace and contentment
and serenity and he standing there on
the road was an integral part of the scene
--no painter would leave out the village
cure standing hatless on the road-the
village cure would indeed stand out as
the central figure like a benediction upon
all the rest

  why then should he not in truth as
in semblance enter into this scene of
tranquillity where did they come from
those words that were so foreign to all
about him where had they found birth

and why were they seared into his brain
so that he could not banish them surely
they were but an hallucination-he had
only to look around him to find evidence
of that

  surely they had no basis in fact those
words- hanged by the neck until you
are dead and may god have mercy on
your soul

  they seemed to fade slowly away old
grandmother frenier and her spinning-
wheel and the children puddling in the
mud and the buckboard coming along the
road and he no longer heard the
whistling from the carpenter-shop-it
seemed to fade out like a picture on a
moving-picture screen while another crept
-there at first intangible and undefined
to supplant the first

  it was somber and dark and a narrow
space and a shadowy human form then
there came a ray of light-sunlight only
the gladness and the brightness were not
in the sunlight because it had first to pass
through an opening where there were iron
bars cut the ray of light nevertheless
grew stronger and the picture took form
there were bare walls and bare floors
and a narrow cot-and it was a cell

  and the shadowy form became more
distinct-it was a man whose back was
turned who stood at the end of the cell
and whose hands were each clutched
around one of the iron bars and who
seemed to be striving to thrust his head
out into the sunlight for his head too
was pressed close against the iron bars
and there was something horribly familiar
in the figure

  and then the head turned slowly and
the sunlight that was robbed of its
warmth and its freedom slanted upon a
pale cheek and ashen lips and eyes that
were torture-burned and the face was the
face of the man who was-to be hanged
by the neck until he was dead and upon
whose soul that voice had implored the
mercy of god

  raymond stared at his hat which was
lying in the road how had it got there
he did not remember that he had dropped


all-story weekly

it he had been holding it in his hand
this buckboard that was approaching
would run over it he stooped and picked
it up and mechanically began to brush
away the dust

  that figure in the buckboard seemed to
be familiar too yes of course it was
m dupont the assistant chief of the
tournayville police-the man who always
answered his own questions and clucked
with his tongue as though he were some
animal learning to talk

  but dupont mattered little now it
was not old grandmother frenier and her
spinning-wheel that was reality-it was
father frangois aubert in the condemned-
cell of the tournayville jail waiting to be
hanged by the neck until he was dead for
the murder of theophile blondin

  raymond put on his hat with forced
calmness he must settle this with him-
self he could not afford to lose his poise
-either mentally or physically he laid
no claim to the heroic or to the quixotic
-he did not want to die in the stead of
that man or in the stead of any other
man neither was he a coward-no man
bad ever called raymond chapelle or
arthur leroy or three-ace artie a cow-
ard he was a gambler-and there was
still a chance

  there was the appeal he was gam-
bling now for both their lives he would
lay down no hand he would fight as he
had always fought-to the end-while a
chance remained

  there was still a chance-the appeal
it was long odds he knew that-but it
was a chance-and he was a gambler
he could only wait now for the turn of
the final card he would not tolerate
consideration beyond that point-not if
with all his might he could force his brain
to leave that  afterward  alone

  it was weeks yet to the date set for
the execution of henri mentone for the
murder of theophile blondin and it
would be weeks yet before the appeal was
acted upon he could only wait now-
here-here in st marleau as the good
young father aubert he could not run

awjy or disappear like a pitiful coward
until that appeal had had its answer

  afterward-no there was ho afterward
-not now now it was the ubiquitous
m dupont the short little man with the
sharp features and the roving black eyes
that glanced everywhere at once who was
calling to him and clambering out of the
buckboard

   you are surprised to see me eh mon-
sieur le cure clucked m dupont

  yes you are surprised very well
but what would you say if i told you
that i had come to arrest monsieur le
cure of st marleau eh-what would
you say to that

  arrest curious the cold calculating
alertness that swept upon him at that
word

  what had happened was the game
up-now curious how he measured ap-
praisingly-and almost contemptuously-
the physique of this man before him

  and then under his breath he snarled
an oath at the other curse m dupont
and his perverted sense of humor it was
not the first time dupont had startled
him the man was grinning broadly-
like an ape

   i imagine said raymond placidly
 that what i would say m dupont
would be to inquire as to the nature of the
charge against monsieur le cure of st
marleau

   and i said m dupont  would at
once reply - assault assault - bodily
harm and injury-assault upon the person
of one jacques bourget

  oh said raymond-and smiled
 yes i believe there have been rumors
of it in the village m dupont several
have spoken to me about it and i even
understand that the cure of st marleau
pleads guilty

  and then m dupont puckered up his
face and burst into a guffaw

   cre nom-ah pardon-but it is ex-
cusable one bad little word eh yes it
is excusable but imagine-fancy the
good young father aubert-and jacques
bourget i would have liked to have seen
the six that was his



it yes i would monsieur le cure you
do not look it but you are magnificent
monsieur le cure i lift my hat to you
bon dieu-ah pardon again-but you
were not gentle with jacques bourget
whom one would think could eat you
alive and you told me nothing about
it-you are modest eh yes you are
modest

   i have had no opportunity to be
modest raymond laughed  since so i
understand bourget encountered some of
the villagers on his way home that after-
noon and gave me a reputation that to
say the least of it left me with little to
be modest about

   i believe you chuckled m dupont
 i believe you monsieur le cure since i
too got the story from jacques bourget
himself he desired to swear out a
warrant for your arrest you have not
seen bourget for several days eh mon-
sieur le cure no you have not seen
him but i know very well how to handle
such as he he will swear out no
warrant on the contrary he would very
gladly feed out of anybodys hand just
now-even yours monsieur le cure i
have the brave jacques bourget in jail at
the present moment

   in jail raymonds puzzled frown
was genuine  but-

   wait a minute monsieur le cure -
duponts smile was suddenly gone he
tapped raymond impressively on the
shoulder  there is more in this than
appears on the surface monsieur le cure
you see yes you see well then
listen he talked no longer of a warrant
when i threatened him with arrest for
getting whisky at mother blondins i
had him frightened

   and that brings us to mother blon-
din which s one of the reasons i am here
this afternoon-but we will return to
mother blondins case in a moment

   you remember that i caught bourget
driving on the road the night mentone
tried to escape and that i made him drive
the prisoner to tournayville yes you
remember very good this morning

his wife comes to tournayville to say that
he has not been seen since that night we
make a search he is not hard to find
he has been drunk ever since-we find
him in a room over one of the saloons
just beginning to get sober again also
wre find that since that night bourget who
never has any money has spent a great
deal of money

  where did bourget get that money
you begin to see eh monsieur le cure
yes you begin to see

  m dupont laid his forefinger saga-
ciously along the side of his nose

  very good i begin to question i
am instantly suspicious bourget is sullen
and morose he talks only of a warrant
against you i seize upon that story again
to threaten him with if he does not tell
where he got the money i put him in
jail where i shall keep him for two or
three days to teach him a lesson

    it is another bourget a very lamblike
bourget monsieur le cure before i am
through though i have to promise him
immunity for turning kings evidence do
you see what is coming monsieur le cure
no you do not most certainly you do
not very well then listen

   i am on the track of mentones ac-
complice bourget was in the plot it
was bourget who was to drive mentone
away that night-to the l eustace
station-after they had throttled you
now monsieur le cure -m duponts
eyes were afire m dupont assumed an
attitude m duponts arms wrapped
themselves in a fold upon his breast-
 now monsieur le cure what do you say
to that

  it is amazing-raymonds hands
palms outward were lifted in a gesture
eminently clerical  amazing i can
hardly credit it bourget then knows
who this accomplice is

   no-tonnerre-that is the bad luck
of it scowled dupont but there is
also good luck in it i am on the scent
i am on the trail i shall succeed shall
i not yes certainly i shall succeed
very well then listen


all-story weekly

   it was dark that night the man
went to bourgets house and called bour-
get outside bourget could not see what
the fellow looked like he gave bourget
fifty dollars and promised still another
fifty as soon as bourget had mentone in
the wagon and it was on your account
monsieur le cure that he went to bour-
get

  raymond was incredulous

   on mine he gasped

  yes certainly-on yours it was to
offer bourget a chance to revenge himself
on you you see eh yes you see
he said he had heard of what you had
done to bourget very well we have
only to analyze that a little and instantly
we have a clue you see where that
brings us eh monsieur le cure

  raymond shook his head

   no i must confess i dont he said

  hah no tiens ejaculated du-
pont almost pityingly  it is easy to be
seen monsieur le cure that you would
make a very poor police officer and an
equally poor criminal-the law would
have its fingers on you while you were
wondering what to do it is so is it not
yes it is so you are much better as a
priest as a priest-i pay you the com-
pliment monsieur le cure-you are in-
comparable very good listen then
i will explain

   the fellow said he had heard of your
fight with bourget splendid excellent
he must then have heard it from some
one therefore he has been seen in the
neighborhood by some one besides bour-
get who is that  some one  who has
talked with a stranger and who can very
likely tell us what that stranger looks like
where bourget cannot i do not say that
it is certain but that it is likely it may
not have been so dark when he talked to
this  some one -eh in any case it is
enough to go on

   now you see monsieur le cure why
i am here - i shall begin to question
everybody and for your part monsieur le
cure you can do a great deal in letting
the parish know what we are after

  raymond looked at dupont with ad-
miration dupont had set himself an-
other  vigil 

  without doubt m dupont he as-
sured the other heartily  certainly i
will do my utmc  to help you i will
have a notice posted on the church door

   good cried dupont with a gratified
smile  and now another matter-and
one that will afford you satisfaction
monsieur le cure in a day or so i will
see that mother blondin is the source of
no more trouble in st marleau-or any-
where else

   mother blondin repeated raymond
-and now he was suddenly conscious that
he was in some way genuinely disturbed

   yes said dupont  twice in the
past we have searched her place wte knew
she sold whisky but she was too sharp
for us-and those who bought knew
how to keep their mouths shut but with
bourget as a witness it is different eh
you see yes you see she is a fester
a sore we will clean up the place we
will put her in jail the air around here
will be the sweeter for it and-

   no said raymond soberly  no
m dupont -his hands reached out and
clasped on the mans shoulders hie knew
now what was disturbing him it was
that surge of pity for the proscribed old
woman that sense of miserable distress
that he had experienced more than once
before

  the scene of that morning when she
had clung to the palings of the fence out-
side the graveyard while they shoveled
the earth upon the coffin of her son rose
vividly before him and it was he again
who was bringing more trouble upon her
now through his dealings with jacques
bourget

  yes it was pity-and more it was
a swiftly matured but none the less de-
termined resolve to protect her

   no m dupont i beg of you -he
shook his head gravely- no you will not
do that

  heh no and why not de-
manded dupont in jerky astonishment
the sin that was his



 i thought you would ask for nothing
better she is already an excommuniee
and-

   and she has suffered enough said
raymond earnestly  it would seem
that sorrow and misery had been the only
life she had ever known she is too old
a woman now to have her home taken
from her and herself sent to jail she is
none too well as it is it would kill her
a little sympathy a little kindness m
dupont-it will succeed far better

   bah sniffed dupont  a little sym-
pathy a little kindness and will that
stop the whisky-selling that the law de-
mands shall be stopped monsieur le
cure

   i will guarantee that said raymond
calmly

  you dupont clucked vigorously
 you will stop that and besides other
things do you perform miracles monsieur
le cure how will you do that

   you must leave it to me -ray-
monds hands tightened in friendly fashion
on duponts shoulders- i will guaran-
tee it if that is a miracle i will attempt
it if i do not succeed i will tell you so
and then you will do as you see fit you
will agree will you not m dupont and
i shall be deeply grateful to you

  dupont shrugged his shoulders help-
lessly

   i have to tell you again that you are
too soft-hearted monsieur le cure yes
there is no other name for it-soft-
hearted and you will be made a fool of
i warn you well-very well  try it
if you like i give you a week if at the
end of a week-well you understand
yes you understand

  i understand said raymond and
with a final clap on the others shoulders
he dropped his hands  and i am of the
impression that monsieur le cure is not the
only one who is soft-hearted

   bah nothing of the sort nothing
of the sort snorted dupont in a sort
of pleased repudiation as he climbed back
into the buckboard  it is only to open
your eyes he picked up the reins  i

  shall spend the rest of the day around
here on that other business do not forget
about the notice monsieur le cure

   it shall be posted on the church door
this afternoon raymond promised

  he stood for a moment looking after
the man as he drove off then turning
abruptly he walked rapidly along jn
the opposite direction and reaching the
station road that led past old mother
blondins door began to climb the hill

  yes decidedly he would post a notice
on the church door for m dupont if
in any way he could aid him to lay hands
on this accomplice of henri mentone he
-the derision that had crept to his lips
faded away and into the dark eyes came
a sudden weariness

  there was humor doubtless in the pic-
ture of m dupont buttonholing every one
he met as he flitted indefatigably all over
the country in pursuit of his mares nest
but somehow he raymond was not in the
mood for laughter-for even grim laugh-
ter there was a man waiting to be
hanged and besides there was valerie

  there was valerie who come what
would some day near or distant whether
he escaped or not must inevitably know
him finally for the man he was not that
it would change her life it was only those
devils of hell who tried to insinuate that
she cared but to him it was a thought
pregnant with an agony so great that he
could pray-he who had thought never to
bow the knee in sincerity to god-yes
that he could pray without mimicry
without that hideous profanation upon his
lips that he might not stand despised a
contemptuous thing a sacrilegious profli-
gate in the eyes of the woman whom he
loved 

  he clenched his hands he was not
logical if he cared so mych as that why
-no here was specious argument he
was logical his love for valerie great
as it might be great as it was in the
final analysis was hopeless

  if he escaped he could never return to
the village he could never return to her-
to be recognized as the good young father


all-story weekly

aubert if he did not escape if he-no
that was the afterward he would not
consent to think of that-only if he did
not escape there would be more than the-
hopelessness of this love to concern him
there would be-death

  yes he was logical the love he knew
for valerie was but to mock him to
tantalize him with a vista of what
under other circumstances he might have
claimed by right of his manhoods fran-
chise-if he had not years ago from a
boy almost bartered away that franchise
to the devil

  well was he to whimper now and turn
like a craven thing from the bitter dregs
that while the cup was still full and the
dregs yet afar off he had held in bald
contempt and incredulous raillery the
dregs were here now they were not bit-
ter on his lips but in his soul they were
bitter almost beyond endurance-but was
he to whimper

  yes he was logical all else might be
hopeless but it was not hopeless that he
might save his life he had a right to
fight for that and he would fight for it
as any man would fight-to the last

  he had climbed the hill now and was
approaching old mother blondins door
logical yes he was logical-but life
was not all logic in the abstract logic
was doubtless a panaceathat was all-
embracing in the presence of the actual
it shrank back a futile thing from the dull
gnawing of the heart and the misery of
the soul

  perhaps that was why he was standing
here at mother blondins door now god
knew she was miserable enough god
knew that the dregs too were now at
her lips they were not unlike-old
mother blondin and himself theirs was
a common cup

  he knocked upon the door-and as he
knocked he caught sight of the old
womans shriveled face peering at him
none too pleasantly from the window
then her step sullen and reluctant
crossed the floor and she held the door
open grudgingly a little way and the

  space thus open she blocked completely
with her body

   what do you want she demanded
sourly

   i would like to come in mme blon-
din raymond answered pleasantly  i
would like to have a little talk with you
 well you cant come in she snarled
defiantly  i dont want to talk to you
and i dont want you coming here it
is true i may have been fool enough to
say you had a good heart but i want
nothing to do with you you are perhaps
not as bad as some of them but you
are all full of tricks with your smirking
mouths no priest would come here if
he were not up to something i am an
excommuniee-eh well i am satisfied
her voice was beginning to rise shrilly
 i dont know what you want and i
dont want to know but you cant
wheedle around me just because jacques
bourget knocked me down and you-
 it is on account of jacques bourget
that i want to speak to you raymond
interposed soothingly  bourget has been
locked up in jail

  she stared at him blinking viciously
behind her glasses

  ah i thought so that is like the
whole tribe of you you had him ar-
rested

   no said raymond  i did not
have him arrested you remember the
note that was read out at the trial mme
blondin-about the attempted escape of
henri mentone

   well mme blondins animosity at
the sight of a soutane was forgotten for
the moment in a newly aroused interest
 well-what of it i remember what
of it

   it seems said raymond  that m
dupont has discovered that bourget was
to help in the escape

  mme blondin cackled suddenly in un-
holy mirth

   and so they arrested him eh well
i am glad do you hear i am glad
i hope they wring his neck for him he
would help the murderer of my son to
the sin that was his



escape would he i hope they hang him
with the other

   they will not hang him raymond
replied  he has given all the informa-
tion in his possession to the police and he
is to go free but it was because of that
afternoon here that he was persuaded to
help in the escape he expected to re-
venge himself on me and that story too
mme blondin is now known to the
police bourget has confessed to buying
whisky here and is ready to testify as a
witness against you

   le maudit mother blondins voice
rose in a virulent scream  i will tear
his eyes out do you hear i will show
jacques bourget what he will get for
telling on me he has robbed me he
never pays well he will pay for this
he will pay for this i will find some
one who will cut his tongue out they
are not all like jacques bourget they
are-

   you do not quite understand mme
blondin raymond interrupted gravely
 it is not with jacques bourget that you
are concerned now it is with the police
m dupont came to the village this after-
noon-indeed he is here now he said
he had evidence enough at last to close
up this place and put you in jail and that
he was going to do so you are in a very
serious situation mme blondin he
made as though to step forward  will
you not let me come in as a friend and
talk it over with you and see what we
can do

  mother blondins hand was like a claw
in its bony thinness as it gripped hard
over the edge of the door

  no you will not come in she
shouted  you or your dupont or your
police-you will not come in eh-they
will take my home from me-all ive got
-they will put me in jail -she was
twisting her head about in a sort of pitiful
inventory of her surroundings

   they have been trying to run me out
of st marleau for a long time-all the
good people the saintly people-you and
your hypocrites they cross to the other

side of the road to get out of old mother
blondins way and so at last between
you you have beaten an old woman who
has no one to protect her since you have
killed her son

   it is a victory-eh go tell them to
ring the church bells-go tell them-go
tell them and on sunday eh you will
have something to preach about it will
make a fine sermon

  somehow there came a lump into ray-
monds throat there was something fine
in this wretched tattered unkempt figure
before him-something of the indomit-
able of the unconquerable in her spirit
misapplied though it was her voice
fought bravely to hold its defiant infu-
riated ring to show no sign of the misery
that had stolen into the dim old eyes and
was quivering on the wrinkled lips but
the voice had broken-once almost in a
sob

   no no mme blondin -he reached
out his hand impulsively to lay it over
the one that was clutched upon the door
- you must not-

  she snatched her hand away-and
suddenly thrust her head through the
partially open doorway into his face

   it is not bourget it is not jacques
bourget  she cried fiercely  it is you
if you had not come that afternoon when
you had no business to come this would
not have happened it is you who-

   that is true said raymond quietly
 and that is why i am here now i
have had a talk with m dupont and he
will give you another chance

  she still held her face close to his

   i do not believe you she flung out
furiously i do not believe you it is
some trick you are trying to play i know
dupont i know him he would give no
one a chance if he could help it i have
been too much for him for a long time
and if he had evidence against me now
he would give me not a minute to sell any
more of-of what he thinks i sell here
 that also is true said raymond as
quietly as before  he could not very
well permit you to go on breaking the


all-story weekly

law if he could prevent it but in
exchange for his promise i have given him
a pledge that you will not sell any more
whisky

  she straightened up-and stared at him
half in amazement half in crafty suspi-
cion

   ah then so it is you and not du-
pont who is going to stop it-eh she
exclaimed with a shrill laugh  and how
do you intend to do it-eh how do
you intend to do it tell me that

   i think it will be very simple said
raymond-and his dark eyes full of a
kindly sympathy looked into hers  to
save your home and you i have pledged
myself to m dupont that this will stop
and so-well mme blondin and so i
have come to put you upon your honor
to make good my pledge

  she craned her head forward again to
peer into his face she looked at him for
a long minute without a word her lips
alternately tightened and were tremulous
the fingers of her hand plucked at the
doors edge and then she threw back
her head in a quavering jeering laugh

  ha ha old mother blondin upon
her honor-think of that you a smooth-
tongued priest-and me an excommuniee
ha ha think of that and what did
dupont say eh-what did dupont say
 he said what i know is not true
said raymond simply he said you
would make a fool of me

  ah he said that-she jerked her
head forward again sharply well du-
pont is wrong and you are right i would
not do that because i could not-since
you have already made one of yourself
ha ha old mother blondin upon her
honor ha ha it is a long while since
i have heard that-and from a priest-ha
ha how could any one make a fool of a
fool

   her voice was high-pitched again fight-
ing for its defiance but somehow where
she strove to infuse venom there seemed
only a pathetic wistfulness instead

   and so you would trust old mother
blondin-eh well -she slammed the

door suddenly in his face and her voice
came muffled through the panels-well
you are a fool 

  the bolt within rasped into place-and
raymond smiling turned away and be-
gan to descend the hill mother blondin
for the moment was in the grip of a
sullen pride that bade her rise in arms
against this fresh outlook on life but
mother blondin would close and bolt yet
another door unless he was very much
mistaken-the rear door and in the faces
of her erstwhile and unhallowed clientele

  yes he had pity for the old woman who
had no kin now and who had no friends
pity he owed her more than that so
then-there came a sudden thought-so
then why not he would not long be
cure of st marleau but while he was-
well he was the cure of st marleau
he could not remove the ban of excom-
munication that was beyond the authority
of a mere cure it would require at least
monseigneur the bishop to do that but he
could remove the ban-of ostracism

  yes decidedly the good young father
aubert could do that he knew that
there were no degrees of excommunica-
tion but that the rigors of the ancient
punishment had been softened by custom
and usage and that the villagers of their
own accord had drawn more and more
aloof from mother blondin it would
therefore not be very difficult

  he quickened his step and reaching
the bottom of the hill made his way at
once toward the carpenter shop he
could see mme bouchard hoeing in the
little garden patch between the road and
the front of the shop it was she that
he now desired to see

   tiens bon jour mme bouchard
he called out to her as he approached
 i am come a penitent i did not deserve
your bread i am sure that you are vexed
with me but  have not seen you since
to thank you

  she came forward to where raymond
now leaned upon the fence

   oh monsieur le cure she exclaimed
laughingly  how can you say such
the sin that was his



things fancy the idea vexed with
you it is only if you really liked it
h-m drawled raymond teasingly
pretending to deliberate  when do you
bake again mme bouchard

  she laughed outright now

   to-morrow monsieur le cure-and i
shall see that you are not forgotten

   it is a long way off-to-morrow
said raymond mournfully and then with
a quick smile  but only one loaf this
time mme bouchard instead of two
nonsense she returned it is a
great pleasure and what are two little
loaves

   a great deal said raymond sud-
denly serious  a very great deal mme
bouchard and especially so if you send
one of the two loaves to some one else
that i know of

  some one else

   yes said raymond  to mother
blondin

  to-mother blondin mme bou-
chard stared in utter amazement  but
-but monsieur le cure you are not in
earnest she-she is an excommuniee
and we-we do not-

   i think it would make her very glad
said raymond softly  and mother
blondin i think has-

  it was on the tip of his tongue to say
that mother blondin was not likely now
to sell any more whisky at the tavern but
he checked himself mother blondin must
be left to tell of that herself if he spread
such a tale she would be more likely than
not to rebel at a situation which she
would probably conceive was being thrust
forcibly down her throat and in pure
spite at what she might also conceive to
be a self-preening and boastful spirit on
his part for his superiority over her sell
all the more no matter what the conse-
quences to herself and so he changed
what he was about to say

   and mother blondin i think has
known but little gladness in her life

 but-but monsieur le cure she
gasped  what would the neighbors say
 i hope said raymond  that they

 would say they too would send her loaves
 -of kindness

   mme bouchard leaned heavily upon
her hoe it is many years monsieur le
cure since almost i was a little girl that
any one has willingly had anything to do
with the old woman on the hill

    yes said raymond gently  and
will you think of that mme bouchard
when you bake to-morrow--the many
 years-and the few that are left-for
the old woman on the hill

   the tears had sprung to mme bou-
chards eyes he left her standing there
leaning on the hoe

   he went on along the road toward the
 presbytere it had been a strange after-
 noon-an illogical one an imaginary one
 almost it seemed to have been a jumble
 of complexities and incongruities and un-
 realities-there was the man who was to
 be hanged by the neck until he was dead
 and a m dupont who through a very
 natural deduction and not because he was
 a fool-for m dupont was very far from
 a fool-was now vainly engaged like a dog
 circling around in a wild effort to catch
 his own tail and there was mother blon-
 din who had another window to gaze
 from and mme bouchard who had still
 another

   yes it had been a strange afternoon-
 only now that a voice in the court-room
 was beginning to ring in his ears again
  father-father frangois aubert-help
 me-i do not understand

   and the gnawing was at his soul again
 and again his hat was lifted from his head
 to cool his fevered brow

   as he reached the church there came
 to him the sound of organ notes and
 instead of crossing to the presbytere he
 stepped softly inside to listen-it would
 be valerie-valerie and gauthier beau-
 lieu the altar-boy probably who often
 pumped the organ for her when she was
 at practice

   but as he stepped inside the music
ceased and instead he heard them talking
in the gallery in the stillness of the
church their voices came to him distinctly


all-story weekly

  valerie -yes that was the boys
 voice- valerie why do they call him
 the good young father aubert

 such a question valerie laughed
  why do you call him that yourself

  i dont-any more not after what
 i saw at mass this morning

 raymond drew his breath in sharply

what was this what was this that
gauthier beaulieu the altar-boy had seen
at mass he had fooled the boy-the
boy could not have seen anything he
drew back opening the door cautiously
they were coming down the stairs now-
but he must hear-hear what it was that
gauthier beaulieu had seen

to be continued next week dont forget this magazine it issued weekly and that
you will get the continuation of this story without waiting a month

fr years  skinny jimmy  kelly
the tout was distinguished from
others of the numerous kelly clan
by his title in due course another jimmy
kelly attained sufficient prominence in
racing circles to entitle him also to a
distinctive appellation

   kid  blazer official  monniker  in-
ventor hesitated not at all over the parity
of names the original  skinny now so
chunky as to be a parody on his name
became in the kids double-pointed de-
scriptive slang  one-time skinny
while the latest addition to the racing
kellys was nominated  skinny th
two-th or  tooth the latter being
generally accepted by reason of prominent
rabbit-teeth

  after the winter meeting at emery-
ville the two skinnys together with nu-
merous other  hustlers followed the
 
ponies to the meadows at seattle to
victoria and finally to minora park
near vancouver b c here the touts
reaped a harvest it was the first season
of international race meets in the northern
cities and  form  cut very little ice
among the patrons weird tips made
favorites by sheer weight of moneys
wagered of horses that figured absolutely
 nowhere  on their past performances

  that vancouver meeting was a paradise
for touts something to dream about for
all but one-one-time skinny jimmy
kelly he could not pick a winner cast-
ing about for the  jinx  that worked
the blue paper



against him his minds eye lighted on
skinny th tooth not since th tooths
advent had things  broke  for one-
time hence down with th tooth ob-
viously

  returning from the track on an early
car one-time became aware of two men
conversing in the seat ahead it being
the touts pleasing policy to overhear any
and all communications not meant for his
ear he feigned sleep in order to hear as
much as possible one of the men he
recognized as henry carver owner of a
small  string  of horses of which dal-
bro a consistent handicap performer was
the head

  mr carver was bitterly complaining
to his friend a stranger to kelly of a
leakage in his stable crew which had
started a heavy play on ohara a few
days before from what he heard kelly
gathered that carver had delayed in the
paddock until post-time in the belief that
no one knew ohara was in form

  on finally entering the betting-ring he
discovered that ohara had been played
down from ten to one to six to five car-
ver would not back his horse at the short
odds and had had the pleasure  of
watching the gelding win handily without
a dollar of stable money on him

   now the tip is out on dalbro for
the handicap to-morrow continued the
owner while one-time strained every
faculty so as to miss nothing  george
hart told me as soon as the entries were
out last monday that a certain clique
intend to play him heavily theyve been
told he is ready i have been  prepping 
him on the country roads with my son
 up  to try and keep him under cover
but its useless somehow the word has
gone forth and theyre ready to bet thou-
sands

   mr adams -he lowered his voice
until ears less acute than kellys would
have missed the rest- unless they
change their plans ill teach those bribing
sharpshooters a lesson dalbro is short
he needed one more good work-out to

put him on edge and-he did not get it
if he is in front an eighth of a mile from
the wire to-morrow ill eat that poison-
ous vest of yours

  one-time skinny had heard enough he
dropped off the car at the next corner and
walked into town

             -	ii

  one-time sat in a booth behind the
fraser river bar planning a scheme
whereby he could use the information he
had acquired dalbro would be played
a bookmaker armed with the knowledge
that the horse was  short  could safely
 take off  all the money offered and-
why not quickly he considered the lay-
ers of odds with whom he was acquainted

  humphreys no johnny was square
jones no not jones by a long shot
jones would try to get even for that
chuckawala deal grant well grant
might if- morgan thats th guy
of course morgan

  morgan was the latest addition to the
group of  states  bookmakers morgan
would play fair-fifty-fifty only last
sunday on a trip through the inside pas-
sage the  bookie  had hinted he would
listen to  info  of a sure nature kelly
had morgans address in his note-book

  he was interrupted in his search
through its pages by footsteps in the hall-
way leading from the rear entrance a
stockily-built man strode through to the
bar favoring one-time with a hard stare
even looking back over his shoulder as he
passed through the curtained doorway

  huh grunted skinny yuh big
hink yuh oughta know me next time
yuh meet me in m airyplane and re-
turned to his quest of the elusive address
so engrossed was he that he did not
notice a soldierly-looking man who parted
the curtains and stood for a full minute
sizing him up this man hesitated as
though about to speak then swung on
his heel and walked out nodding to the
bartender a moment later one-time ap-
peared in the bar

   lo jack he growled  who was


all-story weekly

that mark that just went out he
gunned me like i owed im

   dont yuh know him queried jack
white a native son from frisco naturally
mistaking the party referred to  thats
donahue sergeant of  dicks from th
way he give yuh th  -  i thought he
was gointa slip yuh a  blue paper 
yeah jeered one-time fat
chanct these cockney bobbys have t
hand me one o them passports i stand
purty well here mself thats a fine
crack fer yuh t make

  the bartender reddened angrily

   dont yuh fool yuhrself mister jim-
my fresh he shouted as kelly headed
for the door  any time yuh figger
these bulls as dummys yuhre way off
they- the door slammed and he left
the rest unsaid

  one-time skinny kelly plodded mo-
rosely on his way to the hotel where
morgan resided in the back of his brain
the words  blue paper-blue paper 
adapted themselves to the rhythm of his
footsteps suppose he should get one
it would be just his luck

  the  blue paper  is an institution
peculiarly vancouveresque when a va-
grant parasite or what other petty of-
fender of public morals becomes particu-
larly obnoxious officers do not arrest him
instead notice is served on such party
that his presence in the city after the
departure of the first boat will be con-
strued as a contempt of the law and
that certain punishment will follow

  that notice is always written on blue
paper hence the cognomen the docu-
ment is clearly worded and means just
that from it there is no appeal if
the one so warned remains he  stands
a pinch and so certain of a conviction
is the officer of any british possession
before an arrest is made that recipients
of the  blue paper  invariably heed its
warning

iii

  one-times route led him past the
central police station as the lights of it

hove in sight he was seized with an in-
spiration a certain inspector of police
was an inveterate race follower kelly
had in a flash of his old-time form
 sent the official in  for three winning
bets for matters of policy he had re-
fused a  cut  of the winnings but now
decided to avail himself of the promise
to return the favor at any time possible
he turned boldly in at the door and asked
for inspector hayden

   cap he said as he took the prof-
fered chair  i come t do yuh a favor
an t get one off yuh at th same time
what dyuh like in th handicap t-mor-
row

   why answered the puzzled inspect-
or  i rather fancied dalbro ive been
informed that he has a good bit of a
chance

   i thought so affirmed kelly with
deep satisfaction  now cap yuh just
lay offa that hoss hes a good hoss-
when hes ready-but hes short he
wont go th route i know what im
talkin about keep this under yuhr hat
an save yuhrself a bet if yuh wanta
play th race set it in on april maid
shell walk in

   now ill tell yuh what yuh can do
fer me theys a feller here by th same
name as mine-jimmy kelly ive had
a lot o trouble on account o him hes
a tout-a common hustler dont pertend
t do nothin but lay suckers hes cop-
pin big dough offa these english john-
nies up here but he cant light on a track

   now i aint no snitch cap but this

me but i dont want him pinched an i
dont want nobudy t know i hollered
but cant yuh fix it some way sos hell
get a plite invite t slip back over th
border

   mr kelly said inspector hayden
smiling through his mustache  i appre-
ciate your tip about dalbro and i shall
the blue paper



heed it as to the thorn in your flesh
i think i may safely promise that on the
departure of the princess victoria to-
morrow night your namesake will be listed
among her passengers if you will please
excuse me now i have some routine mat-
ters to dispose of good night mr
kelly and drop in any time

  highly elated over his machiavellian
cunning in ridding himself of his jinx and
making a better friend of the powerful
inspector at one and the same stroke
one-time skinny jimmy kelly blithely
wended his way in search of morgan the
bookmaker him he found in his rooms
preparing to retire for the night one-
time related the conversation he had over-
heard

   now he said in conclusion  this
hoss is gointa be played-heavy yuh
oughta take off a chunk to th race ill
go hen carver one better if dalbro
wins ill agree t eat him tack jock
an all

  morgan pondered over the proposition
for a few moments

   i intended to favor the horse he
said finally  but if what you say is
true- he subjected kelly to a search-
ing scrutiny which that worthy stood
without flinching one-time was so
absolutely convinced that carver had
spoken truthfully that even his shifty
eyes flashed assurance morgan was
satisfied

   no yuh aint lyin kell he decid-
ed  ill take a chance with th stal-
lion out of it april maid should romp
ill hold her out an lay against th horse

   but if yuhre givin- me th wrong
steer he added darkly  kelly ill-ill
-well dont do it thats all

   ill see yuh at th track an if every-
thing goes right you be at th moosehead
billiard hall at six oclock ill send

to th race i dont want yuh t look me
up to ask any questions beat it now
an walk down-stairs slong

  a beautiful day and a minor stake
the saturday handicap brought out a
record crowd for the days racing bank
holiday released hundreds and betting
was never brisker in the big ring

  solid members of the nobility rubbed
elbows with or were jostled by cockney
clerks in the swirl of the crowded human
maelstrom monocles were in evidence
on the lawn and in the club-house frock
coats and high hats contrasted with
screaming checks in the paddock and
betting-ring it was a typical holiday
crowd of cosmopolitan vancouver

  opening odds on the fourth race dis-
closed april maid as the favorite at seven
to five with dalbro a second choice at
two and a half to one from the first
there was a concerted play on the stallion
that forced the odds on him down until
he ruled an equal choice with the maid
at two to one and still the dalbro
money poured in it seemed as though
every patron of the races from millionaire
bank president to humblest  punter  or
 piker  meant to have a monetary in-
terest in the horses sure win

  morgan laid the best odds in the ring
from opening until starting-bell as the
bettors struggled before his book fairly
raining money upon him he spent some
anxious moments wondering if the tout
had not merely taken a chance he was
a gamester however and when the bar-
rier sprung in front of the grandstand for
the mile dash morgan wiped his slate of
the longest odds in the betting-ring-


all-story weekly

dalbro four to five the book stood to
dear over six thousand to the race if
dalbro finished second or worse

  one-time skinny made no attempt to
lay a client to the race from the
first posting of odds he stood in the
crowd before morgans book watching
every bet accepted his rather sluggish
mind soon lost track of the increasing
total of moneys wageredand although he
could see that morgan intended to fulfil
his agreement he stuck doggedly to his
post the only time he left his position
was to rush across the ring and bet five
dollars on april maid at three to one

  morgan gritted his teeth as he spotted
one-time on guard

   that guys so crooked himself he
muttered  that he wouldnt trust ol
saint peter t pick him out a halo hed
want th key to th prop-room fer fear
th ol boyd slip im a phony it galls
me t mingle with that sport but  all
pleasures have their pains as th monkey
said when he kissed th porkypine

  true to carvers prediction dalbro
was short as he began to drop behind
the challenging april maid at the eighth
pole morgan motioned one-time to step
up on the block beside him

   know donohue th dick asked
morgan  see him standin by th fence
talkin to a feller

  kelly looked in the indicated direction
and discovered the man who had aroused
his ire by staring so closely as he passed
through the fraser river the night be-
fore talking to a tall soldierly-looking
party jimmy nodded

   thats my outside man harding
talkin to donohue hes th one ill send
to-night with yuhr bit be near th door
in th moosehead at six sharp away
now

v

  a group of touts sat in the rear of the
moosehead billiard parlors a little before
six oclock that evening they were lis-
tening to skinny jimmy kelly th tooth
who was  making a roar

   i dont understand this at all com-
plained th tooth bitterly  ive put
williams onta a dozen good things at th
meetin an he never fell down on me
before course this is th first time hes
made any such bet as two grand but
gee im sure entitled to a split on this
one if i dont stop im hes bound t
lose it on dalbro he fell hard fer th
tip on th stud an i had t talk an arm
offa mself t get im t switch t april
maid i didnt give dalbro a chance i
thought th maid was in

   yuh was lucky at that stated th
salt lake kid dalbros th best hoss

between losin two grand an winnin six

dock hello whos that grouch one-
time pointin out in this bunch

  ear the door one-timeskinny had
waited for half an hour at five minutes
to six the door opened admitting the
stockily-built man whom he believed was
donohue the detective the touts heart
gave a joyful bound as the man stood
glancing over the players and loungers

   i bet donohues lookin fer th tooth
now chortled one-time sure enough
the official-looking person crossed over to
him and said bruskly
the blue paper



   im looking for jimmy kelly is he
about at the same time half-removing
a blue envelope from his inside pocket

   thats him standin up back there
said one-time pointing  th one with
th buck teeth the stranger hesitated

   are you sure he asked sharply  i

synopsis of preceding chapters

koyala daughter of leveque a french trader and a native borneo woman has been brought
up as white at the mission school when she learns of her birth her horror and bitterness
turn to hatred of the white race and she becomes the leader of her mothers people-pirates
and head-hunters-who call her bintang burung the argus pheasant and on account of her white
skin and education look up to her with superstitious awe under her leadership lawlessness has
thriven until the dutch government is desperate his excellency van schouten by advice of his
secretary sachsen appoints peter gross the american mate of the ship coryander resident at
bulungan peter after some hesitation decides to accept but is warned by sachsen that koyala
is a beauty and a siren who has already got the acting-resident mynheer muller entirely under
her influence peter decides to take with him only twenty-five picked men he has little difficulty
in getting these but finds it hard to get a leader to suit him finally an old sea captain tells him
of an ex-american army officer captain carver gross finds carver exactly the man he wants and
hires him they arrive in bulungan where peter goes ashore alone and interviews muller and van
slyck the military commander

     peter calls a meeting of all the native chiefs rajas et cetera and tries to win their confidence
under the secret influence of ah sing however the worst element gets control and peter is about
to be killed when koyala interferes and turns the tide in grosss favor most of the chiefs swearing
blood brotherhood captain carver however is not convinced of koyalas good faith and that
same night a poisoned arrow narrowly misses peter a sea dyak is killed and the hill dyaks are
accused accompanied only by paddy rouse peter goes to make inquiry into the murder and
proves to the satisfaction of the chief that the man was killed by his own brother who wanted his
wife and not by a hill dyak a tribal war is averted but ah sing with his gang of pirates turn
up and claim peter as his legitimate prey koyala again interferes insisting that the resident be
allowed to depart in peace he does so but later ah sing treacherously waylays his boat and
captures both he and paddy they are taken ashore to be held fo- torture but the native borneans
seeing paddys red hair believe him a child of the sun and refuse to allow him to be killed peter
however they do not care about and he is taken away by the chinamen in the temporary absence
of ah sing captain carver warned through koyala effects a rescue of peter but paddy has dis-
appeared they follow the tracks of his captors until a scout appears with the news that a big
band of natives is just before them

the fight on the beach

garver gave a low-voiced com-
mand to halt and enjoined his
men to see to their weapons as
he ran his eyes over his company and saw

this story began in the au-story weekly for february 



 their dogged jaws and alert watchful
 faces devoid of any trace of nervousness
 and excitability his face lit with a quiet
 satisfaction these men would fight-
 they were veterans who knew how to fight
 and they had a motive-paddy was a
 universal favorite
the argus pheasant



  a dyak plunged through the bush to-
ward jahi and jabbered excitedly jahi
cried

   china boy him go proa three-four
sampun

   lead the way carver cried peter
gross translated

   double time the captain shouted as
jahi and his tribesmen plunged through
the bush at a pace too swift for even peter
gross

  in less than three minutes they reached
the edge of the jungle back about fifty
yards from the coral beach four hun-
dred yards from shore a proa was being
loaded from several large sampuns some
distance out to sea near the horizon was
another proa

  a sharp command from carver kept his
men from rushing out on the beach in their
ardor in a moment or two every rifle in
the company was covering the sampuns
but there were sharp eyes and ears on
board the proa as well as on shore and a
cry of alarm was given from the deck
the chinese in the sampuns leaped up-
ward at the same moment carver gave
the command to fire

  fully twenty chinamen on the two sam-
puns floating on the leeward side of the
proa made the leap to her deck and of
these eleven fell back so deadly was the
fire only two of them dropped into the
boats the others falling into the sea
equipped with the latest type of magazine
rifle carvers irregulars continued pump-
ing lead into the proa several chinamen
thrust rifles over the rail and attempted a
reply but when one dropped back with a
bullet through his forehead and another
with a creased skull they desisted and
took refuge behind the ships steel-jacket-
ed rail perceiving that the proa was
armored against rifle-fire carver ordered
all but six of his command to cease firing
the six making things sufficiently hot to
keep the pirates from replying

  the sampuns were sinking built of
skins placed around a bamboo frame they
had been badly cut by the first discharge
as one of them lowered to the gunwale

those on shore could see a wounded china-
man scarce able to crawl beg his com-
panions to throw him a rope a coil of
hemp shot over the deck of the vessel
the pirate reached for it but at that mo-
ment the sampun went down and left him
swirling in the water a dorsal fin cut
the surface close by there was a little
flurry and the pirate disappeared

  peter gross made his way through the
bush toward carver the latter was
watching the proa with an anxious frown

   theyve got a steel jacket on her he
declared in answer to the residents ques-
tion  so long as they dont show them-
selves we cant touch them we couldnt
go out to them in sampuns if we had
them theyd sink us

   concentrate your fire on the water-
line peter gross suggested  the ar-
mor doesnt probably reach very low and
some of these proas are poorly built

  a good idea carver bellowed the
order

  the fire was concentrated at the stern
where the ship rode highest that those
on board became instantly aware of the
maneuver was evident from the fact that
a pirate hideously attired with a belt of
human hands leaned over the bow to
slash at the hempen cable with his kris
he gave two cuts when he straightened
spasmodically and tumbled headlong into
the sea he did not appear above the
surface again

   ecu john vander esse a member
of the crew murmured happily refilling
his magazine  now for nummer twee
number two

  but the kris had been whetted to a
keen edge a gust of wind filled the
proas cumbersome triangular sail and
drove her forward the weakened cable
snapped the ship lunged and half rolled
into the trough of the waves then the
steersmen sheltered in their box gained
control and swung it about

   gif heem all you got anderson a
big scandinavian and particularly fond of
rouse yelled the concentrated fire of
the twenty-five rifles emptied refilled and


all-stpry weekly

emptied as fast as human hands could per-
form these operations centered on the
stern of the ship even sturdy teak could
not resist that battering the proa had
not gone a hundred yards before it was
seen that the stern was settling suddenly
it came about and headed for the shore

  there was a shrill yell from jahis
dyaks carver shouted a hoarse order to
jahi who dashl away with his hillmen
to the point where the ship was about to
ground the rifle-fire kept on undimin-
ished while carver led his men in short
dashes along the edge of the bush to the
same spot the proa was nearing the
beach when a white flag was hoisted on
her deck carver instantly gave the order
to cease firing but kept his men hidden
the proa lunged on a hundred feet
from the shore it struck on a shelf of coral
the sound of tearing planking was dis-
tinctly audible above the roar of the
waves the water about the ship seemed
to be fairly alive with fins

   we will accept their surrender peter
gross said to carver stepping forward
 i shall tell them to send a boat ashore
 dont expose yourself mr gross
carver cried anxiously peter gross
stepped into the shelter of a coconut-palm
and shouted the malay for  ahoy

  a chinaman appeared at the bow his
dress and trappings showed that he was a
juragan

   lower a boat and come ashore but
leave your guns behind peter gross or-
dered

  the juragan cried that there was no
boat aboard peter gross conferred with
jahi who had hastened toward them to
find out what the conference meant
when the resident told him that there was
to be no more killing his disappointment
was evident

   they have killed my people without
mercy he objected  they will cut my
brothers throat to-morrow and hang his
skull in their lodges

  it was necessary to use diplomacy to
avoid mortally offending his ally the resi-
dent saw

   it is not the white mans way to kill
when the fight is over he said  more-
over we will hold them as hostages for
our son whom djath has blessed

  jahi nodded dubiously  my brothers
word is good he said  there is a creek
near by maybe my boys find him sam-
pun

   go my brother peter gross direct-
ed  come back as soon as possible

  jahi vanished into the bush a half-
hour later peter gross made out a small
sampun paddled by two dyaks approach-
ing from the south that the dyaks were
none too confident was apparent from the
anxious glances that they shot at the proa
already showing signs of breaking up

  peter gross shouted again to the jura-
gan and instructed him that every man
leaving the proa must stand on the rail
in full sight of those on shore and show
that he was weaponless before descending
into the sampun the juragan consented

  it required five trips to the doomed
ship before all on board were taken off
there were thirty-seven in all-eleven
sailors and the rest off-scourings of the
java and celebes seas whose only voca-
tion was cutting throats they glared at
their captors like tigers it was more than
evident that practically all of them except
the juragan fully expected to meet the
same fate that they meted out to every
one who fell into their hands and were
prepared to sell their lives as dearly as
possible

   a nasty crew carver remarked to
peter gross as the pirates were herded on
the beach under the rifles of his company
 every mans expecting to be handed the
same dose as hes handed some poor devil
i wonder why they didnt sink with their
ship

  peter gross did not stop to explain al-
though he knew the reason why-the mo-
hammedans horror of having his corpse
pass into the belly of a shark

   weve got to tie them up and make a
chain gang of them carver said thought-
fully  i wouldnt dare go through the
jungle with that crew any other way
the argus pheasant



  peter gross was looking at jahi in
earnest conversation with several of his
tribesmen he perceived that the hill
chief had all he could do to restrain his
people from falling on the pirates long
their oppressors

   i will speak to them he announced
quietly he stepped forward

   servants of ah sing he shouted in
an authoritative tone all eyes were in-
stantly focused on him

   servants of ah sing he repeated
 the fortunes of war have this day made
you my captives you must go with me
to bulungan if you will not go you
shall die hete

  a simultaneous movement affected the
pirates they clustered more closely to-
gether fiercely defiant and stared with
the fatalistic indifference of oriental
peoples into the barrels of the rifles aimed
at them

   youve all heard of me peter gross
resumed you know that the voice of
peter gross speaks truth that lies do not
come from his mouth he glanced at a
chinaman on the outskirts of the crowd
 speak wong ling lo you sailed with
me on the daisy deane is it not so
wong ling lo was now the center of
attention each of the pirates awaited his
reply with breathless expectancy peter
grosss calm assurance his candor and
simplicity was already stirring in them a
hope that in other moments they would
have deemed utterly fantastic contrary to
all nature-a hope that this white man
might be different from other men might
possess that attribute so utterly incompre-
hensible to their dark minds-mercy

   peter gross him no lie was wong
ling los unemotional admission

   you have heard what wong ling lo
says peter gross cried  now listen to
what i say you shall go back with me to
bulungan alive if you are willing dead
if you are not at bulungan each one of
you shall have a fair trial every man
who can prove that his hand has not taken
life shall be sentenced to three years on
the coffee plantations for his robberies

then he shall be set free and provided
with a farm of his own to till so that he
may redeem himself every man who has
taken human life in the service of ah
sing shall die

  he paused to see the effect of his an-
nouncement the owlish faces turned to-
ward him were wholly enigmatic but the
intensity of each mans gaze revealed to
peter gross the measure of their interest

   i cannot take you along the trail
without binding you he said  your
oaths are worthless i must use the power
i have over you therefore you will now
remember the promise i have made you
and submit yourselves to be bound jura-
gan you are the first

  as one of carvers force came forward
with cords salvaged from the proa the
juragan met him placed his hands behind
his back and suffered them to be tied to-
gether the next man hesitated then
submitted also casting anxious glances at
his companions the third submitted
promptly the fourth folded his hands
across his chest

   i remain here he announced

  very well peter gross said impas-
sively he forced several chinamen who
were near to move back they gave
ground sullenly at carvers orders a
firing-squad of three men stood in front of
the chinaman whose back was toward the
bay

   will you go with us peter gross
asked again

  the chinamans face was a ghostly
gray but very firm

   allah wills i stay here he replied
his lips curled with a calm contemptu-
ousness at the white mans inability to rob
him of the place in heaven that he be-
lieved his murders had made for him
with that smile on his lips he died

  a sudden silence came upon the crowd
even jahis dyaks scarcely restrained by
their powerful chief before this ceased
their mutterings and looked with new re-
spect on the big orang blanda resident
there were no more refusals among the
chinese on instructions from peter

gross four of them were left unbound to
carry the body of their dead comrade to
bulungan  alive or dead he had said
so it would be all understood

chapter xxvi

 to half of my kingdom-

captain carver selected a cigar
from peter grosss humidor and
reclined in the most comfortable
chair in the room

   a beastly hot day he announced
wiping the perspiration from his forehead
 regular manila weather

   the monsoon failed us again to-day
peter gross observed

  carver dropped the topic abruptly  i
dropped over he announced  to see if
the juragan talked any

  peter gross glanced out of the window
toward the jungle-crowned hills the
lines of his mouth were very firm

 he told me a great deal he said

   about paddy there was an anx-
ious ring in carvers voice

 about paddy-and other things

   the lads come to no harm

   he is aboard ah sings proa the proa
we saw standing out to sea when we
reached the beach he is safe-for the
present at least he will be useful to ah
sing the natives reverence him so highly
thank god carver ejaculated in a
relieved voice  well get him back it
may take time but well get him

  peter gross made no reply he was
staring steadfastly at the hills again

   odd he didnt take you too carver
remarked

   the juragan told me that he intended
to come back with a portion of his crew
for me later peter gross said  they
fan short of provisions so they had to
go back to the proas and they took paddy
with them some one warned them you
were on the march with jahi so they fled
tsang che the juragan says his crew was
slow in taking on fresh water that is how
we were able to surprise him

  that explains it carver remarked
  i couldnt account for their leaving you
 behind

 peter gross lapsed into silence again

  did you get anything else from him
 any real evidence carver suggested
 presently

 the resident roused himself with an
 effort

  a great deal even more than i like
 to believe

  he turned states evidence

  you might call it that

 you got enough to clear up this
 mess

  no peter gross replied slowly  i
 would not say that what he told me
 deals largely with past events things that
 happened before i came here it is the
 present with which we have to deal

  im a little curious carver con-
 fessed

 peter gross passed his hand over his
 eyes and leaned back

  he told me what i have always be-
 lieved of the confederation of pirates
 with ah sing at their head of the agree-
 ments they have formed with those in
 authority of where the ships have gone
 that have been reported missing from time
 to time and what became of their cargoes
 of how my predecessor died he made a
 very full and complete statement i have
 it here written in dutch and signed by
 him peter gross tapped a drawer in his
 desk

  it compromises van slvck

  he is a murderer

  of de jonge-your predecessor

  it was his brain that planned

  muller

  a slaver and embezzler

   youre going to arrest them carver
 scanned his superiors face eagerly

  not yet peter gross dissented quiet-
 ly  we have only the word of a pirate
 so far and it covers many things that
 happened before we came here

  were waiting too long carver as-
 serted dubiously  weve been lucky so
 far but luck will turn
the argus

pheasant



  we are getting the situation in hand
better every day they will strike soon
their patience is ebbing fast and we will
have the prins with us in a week

   the blow may fall before then

   we must be prepared it would be
folly for us to strike now we have no
proof except this confession and van
slyck has powerful friends at home

   that reminds me carver exclaimed
 maybe these documents will interest
you they are the papers jahi found on
your jailers they seem to be a set of
accounts but theyre dutch to me he
offered the papers to peter gross who un-
folded them and began to read

  are they worth anything carver
asked presently as the resident carefully
filed them in the same drawer in which he
had placed tsang ches statement

   they are ah sings memoranda they
tell of the disposition of several cargoes of
ships that have been reported lost recently
there are no names but symbols it may
prove valuable some day

   what are your plans

   i dont know i must talk with koy-
ala before i decide she is coming this
afternoon

  peter gross glanced out of doors at that 
moment and his face brightened  here
she comes now he said

  carver rose  i think ill be going
he declared gruffly

   stay captain by all means

  carver shook his head he was frown-
ing and he cast an anxious glance at the
resident

   no i dont trust her id be in the
way anyway he glanced swiftly at the
resident to see the effect of his words
peter gross was looking down the lane
along jvhich koyala was approaching a
necklace of flowers encircled her throat
and bracelets of blossoms hung on her
arms-gardenia tuberose hill daisies and
the scarlet bloom of the flame-of-the-forest
tree her hat was of woven nipah palm-
leaves intricately fashioned together al-
together she was a most alluring picture
when peter gross looked up carver was

gone koyala entered with the familiarity
of an intimate friend

    what is this i hear peter gross
asked with mock severity  you have
been saving me from my enemies again

   koyala s smile was neither assent nor
denial

    this is getting to be a really serious
situation for me he chaffed i am
finding myself more hopelessly in your
debt every day

   koyala glanced at him swiftly search-
ingly his frankly ingenuous almost boy-
ish smile evoked a whimsical response
from her

   what are you going to do when i
present my claim she demanded

   peter gross spread out his palms in
mock dismay  go into bankruptcy he
replied  its the only thing left for me
to do

    my bill will stagger you she warned

   you know the persians answer  all
that i have to the half of my kingdom 
he jested

    i might ask more koyala ventured
daringly

  peter grosss face sobered koyala
saw that for some reason her reply did
not please him a strange light glowed
momentarily in her eyes instantly con-
trolling herself she said in carefully mod-
ulated tones

    you sent for me mynheer

    i did peter gross admitted  i
must ask another favor of you koyala
the mirth was gone from his voice also

    what is it she asked quietly

    you know whom we have lost peter
gross said plunging directly into the sub-
ject  ah sing carried him away his
uncle the boys only living relative is an
 old sea captain under whom i served for
some time and a very dear friend i
promised him  would care for the lad i
must bring the boy back you alone can
help me

   the burning intensity of koyalas eyes
moved even peter gross unskilled as he
was in the art of reading a womans heart
through her eyes he felt vaguely un-


all-story weekly

comfortable vaguely felt a peril he could
not see or understand

   what will be my reward if i bring
him back to you koyala asked her
tone was almost flippant

   you shall have whatever lies in my
power as resident to give peter gross
promised gravely

  koyala laughed there was a strange
jarring note in her voice

   i accept your offer mynheer resi-
dent she said  but you should not
have added those two words  as resi-
dent 

  rising like a startled pheasant she
glided out of the door and across the
plain peter gross stared after her until
she had disappeared

chapter xxvii

a woman scorned

it was inchi who brought the news of
 paddys return three days after
koyalas departure the little dyak
lad burst breathlessly upon a colloquy
between peter gross and captain carver
and announced excitedly

   him djath boy him orang blanda
djath boy him come

   what the devil is he driving at
carver growled the circumlocution of
the south sea islander was a perennial
mystery to him

   paddy is coming peter gross cried
 now get your breath inchi and tell us
where he is

  his scant vocabulary exhausted inchi
broke into a torrent of dyak by requir-
ing the lad to repeat several times peter
gross finally understood his message

   paddy koyala and some of koyalas
dyaks are coming along the mountain
trail he announced  they will be here
in an hour she sent a runner ahead to
let us know but the runner twisted an
ankle inchi found him and got the mes-
sage

  there was a wild cheer as paddy dusty
and matted with perspiration several

dyaks and koyala emerged  from the
banyan-grove and crossed the plain dis-
cipline was forgotten as the entire com-
mand crowded around the lad

   i shot two chinamans for you
vander esse announced an now daat
vas all unnecessary

   ye cant keep a rid-head bottled up
larry malone another member of the
company shouted exultingly

   aye ban tank we joost get it nice
quiet van you come back again ander-
son remarked in mock melancholy the
others hooted him down

  koyala stood anart from the crowd with
her dyaks and looked on glancing up-
ward peter gross noticed her noticed
too the childishly wistful look upon her
face he instantly guessed the reason-
she felt herself apart from these people of
his unable to share their intimacy re-
morse smote him she to whom all their
success was due and who now rendered
this crowning service deserved better
treatment he hastened toward her

   koyala he said his voice vibrant
with the gratitude he felt  how can we
repay you

  koyala made a weary gesture of dissent
 let us not speak of that now myn-
heer she said

   but come to my home he said  we
must have luncheon together-you and
captain carver and paddy and i with
a quick afterthought he added  i will in-
vite mynheer muller also

  the momentary gleam of pleasure that
had lit koyalas face at the invitation
died at the mention of mullers name

   i am sorry she said but there was
no regret in her voice  i must go back
to my people to djaths temple and the
priests it is a long journey i must start
at once

  you cannot leave us now peter
gross exclaimed in consternation

   for the present i must she said re-
signedly  perhaps when the moon is
once more in the full i shall come back
to see what you have done

   but we cannot do without you
the argus pheasant



   is a woman so necessary she asked
and smiled sadly

   you are necessary to bulungans
peace peter gross affirmed  without
you we can have no peace

   if you need me send one of my
people she said  i will leave him here
with you he will know where to find
me

   but that may be too late peter gross
objected his tone became very grave
 the crisis is almost upon us he de-
clared  ah sing will make the supreme
test soon-how soon i cannot say-but i
do not think he will let very many days
pass by he is not accustomed to being
thwarted i shall need you here at my
right hand to advise me

  koyala looked at him searchingly the
earnestness of his plea the troubled look
in his straightforward gray eyes fixed so
pleadingly upon her seemed to impress
her

   there is a little arbor in the banyan-
grove yonder where we can talk undis-
turbed she said in a voice of quiet au-
thority  come with me

   we can use my office peter gross
offered but koyala shook her head

   i must be on my journey i will see
you in the grove

  peter gross walked beside her he
found difficulty keeping the pace she set
she glided along like a winged thing ko-
yala kd him directly to the clearing and
reclined with a sigh of utter weariness in
the shade of a stunted nipa palm

   it has been a long journey she said
with a wan smile  i am very tired
forgive me peter gross exclaimed
in contrition  i should not have let
you go you must come back with me
to the residency and rest until to-mor-
row

   a half-hours rest will be all i need
koyala replied

   but this is no place for you peter
gross expostulated

   the jungle is my home koyala said
with simple pride  the argus pheas-
ant nests in the thickets

   surely not at night

  what is there to harm me koyala
smiled wearily at his alarm

   but the wild beasts the tigers and
the leopards and the orang-utans in the
hill districts and the snakes

   they are all my friends when the
tiger calls i answer if he is hungry i
keep away i know all the sounds of the
jungle my grandfather chawatangi
taught them to me i know the warning
hiss of the snake as he glides through the
grasses i know the timid hoofbeat of the
antelope i know the stealthy rustle of
the wild hogs they and the jackals are
the only animals i cannot trust

   but where do you sleep -
 if the night is dark and there is no
moon i cut a bundle of bamboo canes i
bind these with creepers to make a plat-
form and hang it in a tree then i swing
between heaven and earth as securely or
more securely than you do in your house
for i am safe from the malice of men if
it rains i make a shelter of palm-leaves
on a bamboo frame these things one
learns quickly in the forest

   you wonderful woman peter grbss
breathed in admiration

  koyala smiled she lay stretched out
her full length on the ground peter gross
squatted beside her

  you havent told me where you
found paddy he remarked after a
pause

   oh that was easy she said  ah
sing has a station a little way this side of
the sadong country-

  peter gross nodded

   i knew that he would go there so i
followed when i got there ah sing was
loading his proa with stores i learned
that your boy was a prisoner in one of
the houses of his people i went to ah
sing and begged his life i told him he
was sacred to djath that the dyaks of
bulungan thought him very holy indeed
ah sing was very angry he stormed
about the loss of his proa and refused to
listen to me he said he would hold the
boy as a hostage

   that night i went to the hut and
found one of my people on guard he
let me in i cut the cords that bound
the boy dyed his face brown and gave
him a womans dress i told him to wait
for me in the forest until he heard my
cry the guard thought it was me when
he left

  her voice drooped pathetically

   they brought me to ah sing he
was very angry he would have killed me
i think if he had dared he struck me
-see here is the mark she drew back
the sleeve of her kabaya and revealed a
cut in the skin with blue bruises about
it peter gross became very white and
his teeth closed together tightly

   that is all she concluded

  there was a long silence koyala co-
vertly studied the residents profile so
boyish yet so masterfully stern as he
gazed into the forest depths she could
guess his thoughts and she half-smiled

   when you left i promised you that
you should have a reward-anything that
you might name and in my power as resi-
dent to give peter gross said presently

   let us not speak of that-yet ko-
yala dissented -tell me mynheer
gross do you love my country

   it is a wonderfully beautiful coun-
try peter gross replied enthusiastically
falling in with her mood  a country
of infinite possibilities we can make it
the garden spot of the world never have
i seen such fertile soil as there is in the
river bottom below us all it needs is
time and labor-and men with vision
koyala rose to a sitting posture and
leaned on one hand with a deft motion
of the other she made an ineffectual ef-
fort to cover her nut-brown limbs cud-
dled among the ferns and grasses with
the shortened kabaya very nymphlike
she looked a diana of the jungle and it
was small wonder that peter gross the
indifferent to woman gave her his seri-
ous attention while she glanced pensively
down the forest aisles

  men with vision she sighed pres-
ently  that is what we have always

needed that is what we have always
lacked my unhappy people ignorant
and none to teach them none to guide
them into the better way leaders have
come have stayed a little while and then
they have gone again brooke helped us
in sarawak - now only his memory is
left a pause  i suppose you will be
going back to java soon again myn-
heer 

   not until my work is completed
peter gross assured gravely

   but that will be soon you will
crush your enemies you will organize
the districts and lighten our burdens for
a while then you will go a new resi-
dent will come things will slip back
into the old rut our young men are hot-
headed there will be feuds wars piracy
there are turns in the wheel but no prog-
ress for us mynheer borneo her
voice broke with a sob and she stole a
covert glance at him

   by heaven i swear that will not
happen koyala peter gross asserted
vehemently  i shall not go away i
shall stay here the governor owes me
some reward the least he can give me is
to let me finish the work i have begun
i shall dedicate my life to bulungan-we
koyala shall redeem her we two

  koyala shook her head her big sor-
rowful eyes gleamed on him for a mo-
ment through tears

   so you speak to-day when yeu are
full of enthusiasm mynheer but when
one or two years have passed and you
hear naught but the unending tales of
tribal jealousies and quarrels over buffa-
loes and complaints about the tax and
falsehood upon falsehood then your am-
bition will fade and you will seek a place
to rest far from borneo

  the gentle sadness of her tear-dimmed
eyes the melancholy cadences of her
voice sighing tribulation like an october
wind among the maples and her eloquent
beauty set peter grosss pulses on fire

   koyala he cried  do you think i
could give up a cause like this-forget
the work we have done together-to
the argus pheasant



spend my days on a plantation in java
like a buffalo in his wallow

   you would soon forget borneo in
java mynheer-and me

  the sweet melancholy of her plaintive
smile drove peter gross to madness

   forget you you koyala my
right hand my savior savior thrice over
to whom i owe every success i have had
without whom i would have failed utter-
ly died miserably in wobangulis hall
you wonderful woman you lovely
adorable woman

  snatching her hands in his he stared
at her with a fierce hunger that was half
passion half gratitude

  a gleam of savage exultation flashed in
koyalas eyes the resident was hers
the fierce insatiate craving for this mo-
ment that had filled her heart ever since
she first saw peter gross until it tainted
every drop of blood now raced through
her veins like vitrol she lowered her
lids lest he read her eyes and bit her
tongue to choke utterance still his grasp
on her hands did not relax at last she
asked in a low voice that sounded strange
and harsh even to her

   why do you hold me mynheer 
the madness of the moment was still
on peter he opened his lips to speak
words that flowed to them without con-
scious thought phrases as utterly foreign
to his vocabulary as metaphysics to a
hottentot then reason resumed her
throne breathing heavily he released
her

   forgive me koyala he said hum-
bly

  a chill of disappointment like an arc-
tic wave submerged koyala she felt the
sensation of having what was dearest in
life suddenly snatched from her her
stupefaction lasted but an instant then
the fury that goads a woman scorned
possessed her and lashed on the blood-
hounds of vengeance

   forgive you she spat venomously
 forgive you for what the words you
did not say just now orang blanda when
you held these two hands

  peter gross had risen quickly and she
also sprang to her feet her face furious
with rage was lifted toward his and her
two clenched fists were held above her
fluttering bosom passion made her al-
most inarticulate

   forgive you for cozening me with
sweet words of our work and our mission
when you despised me for the blood of
my mother that is in me forgive you
for leading me around like a pet parrot to
sayr your words to my people and delude
them forgive you for the ignominy you
have heaped upon me the shame you
have brought to me the loss of friend-
ships and the laughter of my enemies

   koyala- peter gross attempted
but he might as well have tried to stop
niagara

   are these the things you seek forgive-
ness for koyala shrieked liar se-
ducer orang blanda 

  she spat the word as though it were
something vile at that moment there
was a rustling in the cane back of peter
gross bewildered contrite striving to
collect ms scattered wits that he might
calm the tempest of her wrath he did not
hear it but koyala did there was a
savage exultation in her voice as she
cried

   to-morrow the last white will be
swept from bulungan but you will stay
here mynheer-

  hearing the footsteps behind him pe-
ter gross whirled on his heel but he
turned too late a bag was thrust over
his head he tried to tear it away but
clinging arms arms as strong as his held
it tightly about him a heavy vapor as-
cended into his nostrils a vapor warm
with the perfume of burning sandalwood
and aromatic unguents and spices he
felt a drowsiness come upon him strug-
gled to cast it off and yielded with a
sigh like a tired childs he sagged into
the waiting arms and was lowered to the
ground

   very good mynheer muller koyala
said  now if you and cho sing will
bind his legs i will call my dyaks and

the attack on the fort

 when peter gross failed to return
 by noon that day captain car-
 ver becoming alarmed began
 making inquiries hughes supplied the
 first clue

    i saw him go into the bush with the
 heathen woman while we was buzzin
 paddy he informed his commander  i
 aint seen him since

   a scouting party was instantly organ-
 ized it searched the banyan grove but
 found nothing one of the members an
  old plainsman reported heelmarks on the
 trail but as this was a common walk of
 the troops at the fort the discovery had
 no significance

    where is inchi captain carver in- x
 quired search also failed to reveal
 the dyak lad as this disquieting news
 was reported lieutenant banning was
 announced

   the lieutenant a smooth-faced clean-
 cut young officer who had had his com-
 mission only a few years explained the
 object of his visit without indulging in
 preliminaries

    one of my java boys tells me the re-
 port is current in bulungan that we are
 to be attacked to-morrow he announced
  a holy war has been preached and all
 the sea dyaks and malays in the resi-
 dency are now marching this way he
 says the pirate fleet is expected here
 to-night i havent seen or heard of cap-
 tain van slyck since he left for padang

   he was plainly worried and carver
 correctly construed his warning as an ap-
 peal for advice and assistance the cap-
 tain took from his wallet the commission
 that peter gross had given him some
 time before

    since captain van slyck is absent i
 may as well inform you that i take com-
 mand of the fort by order of the resi-

 dent he said giving the document to
 banning the lieutenant scanned it
 quickly

   very good captain he remarked
with a relieved air his tone plainly in-
dicated that he was glad to place respon-
sibility in the crisis upon a more expe-
rienced commander  i suppose you will
enter the fort with your men

   we shall move our stores and all our
effects at once carver declared  are
your dispositions made

   we are always ready captain was
the lieutenants reply

  from the roof of the residency carver
studied bulungan town through field-
glasses there was an unwonted activ-
ity in the village he noticed scanning
the streets he saw the unusual number of
armed men hurrying about and grouped
at street corners and in the marketplace
at the waterfront several small proas
were hastily putting out to sea

   it looks as if banning was right he
muttered

  by sundown carvers irregulars were
stationed at the fort courtesy denomi-
nated it a fort but in reality it was little
more than a stockade made permanent by
small towers of crude masonry filled be-
tween with logs set on end the eleva-
tion however gave it a commanding ad-
vantage in such an attack as they might
expect peter gross had been careful to
supply machine-guns and these were
placed where they would do the most ef-
ficient service putting the javanese at
work carver hastily threw up around
the fort a series of barbed-wire entangle-
ments and dug trench-shelters inside
these operations were watched by an
ever-increasing mob of armed natives
who kept a respectful distance away
however banning suggested a sortie in
force to intimidate the dyaks

   it would be time wasted carver de-
clared  we dont have to be afraid of
this mob they wont show teeth until
the he-bear comes well confine our-
selves to getting ready every second is
precious
the argus pheasant



  a searchlight was one of carvers con-
tributions to the defenses double sen-
tries were posted and the light played the
country about all night but there was no
alarm when dawn broke carver and
banning up with the sun uttered an al-
most simultaneous exclamation a fleet
of nearly thirty proas laden down with
fighting men lay in the harbor

   ah sing has arrived banning re-
marked absent-mindedly he mused  i
wonder if captain van slyck is there

  carver had by this time mastered just
enough dutch to catch the lieutenants
meaning

   what do you know about captain
van slycks dealings with this gang he
demanded looking at the young man
fixedly

   i cant say-that is- banning took
refuge in an embarrassed silence

   never mind carver answered curt-
ly  i dont want you to inform against
a superior officer but when we get back
to batavia youll be called upon to tes-
tify to what you know

  banning made no reply

  carver was at breakfast when word
was brought him that mynheer muller
the controlleur was at the gate and de-
sired to see him he had left orders that
none should be permitted to enter or leave
without special permission from the offi-
cer of the day the immediate thought
that muller was come to propose terms
of surrender occurred to him and he
flushed darkly he directed that the con-
trolleur be admitted

   goeden morgen mynheer kapitein
muller greeted as he entered his face
was very pale but he seemed to carry
himself with more dignity than customari-
ly carver noticed

   state your mission mynheer  car-
ver directed bluntly transfixing the con-
trolleur with his stern gaze

   mynheer kapitein you must fight for
your lives to-day muller said  ah
sing is here there are three thousand
dyaks and malays below his voice
quavered but he pulled himself together

quickly  i see you are prepared there-
fore what i have told you is no news to
you he paused

   proceed carver directed curtly
mynheer kapitein i am here to fight
and die with you the controlleur an-
nounced

  a momentary flash of astonishment
crossed carvers face then his suspic-
ions were redoubled

    i hadnt expected this he said with-
out mincing words  i thought you
would be on the other side

  mullers face reddened but he instant-
ly recovered  there was a time when
i thought so too kapitein he admitted
candidly  but i now see i was in the
wrong what has been done i cannot
undo but i can die with you there is
no escape for you to-day they are too
many and too well armed i have lived
a celebes islander a robber and a friend
of robbers i can at least die a white
man and a hollander

  carver looked at him fixedly

   where is the resident he demanded
   in a hut in the jungle

   in ah sings hands

  he is koyalas prisoner ah sing
does not know he is there

   um carver grunted the exclama-
tion hid a world of meaning it took lit-
tle thought on his part to vision what had
occurred

   why arent you with koyala he
asked crisply

  muller looked away  she does not
want me he said in a low voice

  for the first time since coming to bul-
ungan carver felt a trace of sympathy
for muller he too had been disap-
pointed in love his tone was a trifle less
gruff as he asked  can you handle a
gun

   ja mynheer

   you understand youll get a bullet
through the head at the first sign of
treachery

  muller flushed darkly  ja mynheer
he affirmed with quiet dignity it was the
flush that decided carver

   report to lieutenant banning he
said  hell give you a rifle

  it was less than an hour later that the
investment of the fort began the dyaks
scurrying through the banyan groves and
bamboo thickets enclosed it on the rear
and landward sides ah sings pirates
and the malays crawled up the rise to at-
tack it from the front two of ah sings
proas moved up the bay to shut off escape
from the sea

  an insolent demand from ah sing and
wobanguli that they surrender prefaced
the hostilities

  tell the raja and his chinese cut-
throat that well have the pleasure of
hanging them was carvers reply

  to meet the attack carver entrusted
the defense of the rear and landward
walls to the dutch and javanese under
banning while he looked after the frontal
attack which he shrewdly guessed would
be the most severe taking advantage
of every bush and tree and particularly
the hedges that lined the lane leading
down to bulungan the malays and pi-
rates got within six hundred yards of the
fort a desultory rifle-fire was opened
it increased rapidly and soon a hail of
bullets began sweeping over the enclosure

   theyve got magazine-rifles carver
muttered to himself  latest pattern
too thats what comes of letting trad-
ers sell promiscuously to natives

  the defenders made a vigorous reply
the magazine-rifles were used with telling
effect banning had little difficulty keep-
ing the dyaks back but the pirates and
malays were a different race of fighters
and gradually crept closer in taking ad-
vantage of every bit of cover

  as new levies of natives arrived the
fire increased in intensity there were
at least a thousand rifles in the attacking
force carver judged and some of the pi-
rates soon demonstrated that they were
able marksmen an old plainsman was
the first casualty he was sighting along
his rifle at a daring manchu who had ad-
vanced within three hundred yards of the
enclosure when a bullet struck him in the

forehead and passed through his skull
he fell where he stood

  shortly thereafter gibson an ex-sailor
uttered an exclamation and clapped his
right hand to his left shoulder

   are ye hit larry malone asked

   they winged me i guess gibson
said

  the dutch medical officer hastened
forward  the bones broken he pro-
nounced  well have to amputate

   then let me finish this fight first
gibson retorted picking up his rifle the
doctor was a soldier too he tied the
useless arm in a sling filled gibsons mag-
azine and jogged away to other duties
with a parting witticism about americans
who didnt know when to quit there
was plenty of work for him to do within
the next half-hour ten men were brought
into the improvised hospital and carver
on the walls wondered whether he would
be able to hold the day out

  the firing began to diminish scan-
ning the underbrush to see what signifi-
cance this might have carver saw heavy
columns of natives forming the first
test was upon them at his sharp com-
mand the reply fire from the fort ceased
and every man filled his magazine

  with a wild whoop the malays and
chinese rose from the bush and raced to-
ward the stockade there was an an-
swering yell from the other side as the
dyaks spears and krises waving sprang
from the jungle on the walls silence
the brown wave swept like an avalanche
to within three hundred yards the jav-
anese looked anxiously at their white
leader standing like a statue watching
the human tide roll toward him two
hundred yards-a hundred and fifty
yards the dutch riflemen began to
fidget a hundred yards an uneasy
murmur ran down the whole line fifty
yards

 carver gave the signal banning in-
stantly repeated it a sheet of flame
leaped from the walls as rifles and ma-
chine-guns poured their deadly torrents
of lead into the advancing horde the
the argus pheasant



first line melted away like butter before
a fire their wilds yells of triumph
changed to frantic shrieks of panic the
dyaks broke and fled for the protecting
cover of the jungle while the guns behind
them decimated their ranks the ma-
lays and chinese got within ten yards of
the fort before they succumbed to the
awful fusillade and fled and crawled back
to shelter a mustached manchu alone
reached the gate he waved his huge
kris but at that moment one of carvers
company emptied a rifle into his chest
and he fell at the very base of the wall

  the attack was begun checked and
ended within four minutes over two
hundred dead and wounded natives and
chinese lay scattered about the plain
the loss within the fort had been four
killed and five wounded two of the
dead were from carvers command john
vander esse and a californian as he
counted his casualties carvers lips tight-
ened his thoughts were remarkably
similar to that of the great epirote  an-
other such victory and i am undone

  lieutenant banning mopping his brow
stepped forward to felicitate his com-
manding officer

   theyll leave us alone for to-dav
anyway he predicted

  carver stroked his chin in silence

   i dont think ah sings licked so
soon he replied

  for the next three hours there was only
desultory firing the great body of na-
tives seemed to have departed leaving
only a sufficient force behind to hold the
defenders in check in case they attempted
to leave the fort speculation on the
next step of the natives was soon an-
swered scanning the harbor with his
glasses carver detected an unwonted ac-
tivity on the deck of one of the proas he
watched it closely for a few moments
then he uttered an exclamation

   theyre unloading artillery he told
lieutenant banning

  the lieutenants lips tightened

  we have nothing except these old
guns he replied

   theyre junk carver observed suc-
cinctly  these proas carry krupps
im told

   what are you going to do

   well see whether they can handle it
first if they make it too hot for us-
well well die fighting

  the first shell broke over the fort an
hour later and exploded in the jungle on
the other side twenty or thirty shells
were wasted in this way before the gun-
ner secured the range his next effort
landed against one of the masonry towers
on the side defended by the dutch when
the smoke had cleared away the tower
lay leveled nine dead and wounded men
were scattered among the ruins a yell
rose from the natives which the dutch
answered with a stinging volley

   hold your fire carver directed ban-
ning  wed better take to the trenches
these had been dug the day before and
deepened during the past hour carver
issued the necessary commands and the
defenders except ten pickets concealed
themselves in their earthen shelters

  the gunnery of the chinese artillery-
men improved and gaunt breaches were
formed in the walls one by one the tow-
ers crumbled each well-placed shell was
signalized by cheers from the dyaks and
malays the shelling finally ceased ab-
ruptly carver and banning surveyed
the scene a ruin of fallen stones and
splintered logs was all that lay between
them and the horde of over three thou-
sand pirates and malay and dyak rebels
the natives were forming for a charge

  carver took the lieutenants hand in
his own firm grip  this is probably the
end he said  im glad to die fighting
in such good company

kris at the door peter gross thought over
the events of his administration as resi-
dent of bulungan his thoughts were
not pleasant shame filled his heart and
reddened his brow as he thought of how
confidently he had assumed his mission
how firmly he had believed himself to be
the chosen instrument of destiny to re-
store order in the distracted colony and
punish those guilty of heinous crimes
and how arrogantly he had rejected the
sage advice of his elders

  he recollected old sachsens warning
and his own impatient reply-the event
that he deemed so preposterous at that
time and old sachsen had foreseen had
actually come to pass he had fallen vic-
tim to koyalas wiles and she had be-
trayed him bitterly he cursed his stupid
folly the folly that had led him to enter
the jungle with her the folly of that mad
moment when temptation had assailed
him where man is weakest

   in his bitter self-excoriation he had no
thought of condemnation for her the
fault was his he vehemently assured him-
self lashing himself with the scorpions of
self-reproach she was what nature and
the sin of her father had made her a child
of two alien unincorporable races a
daughter of the primitive wild untamed
uncontrolled loving fiercely hating fierce-
ly capable of supremest sacrifice capa-
ble too of the most fiendish cruelty

  he had taken  this creature and used
her for his own ends he had praised her
petted her treated her as an equal com-
panion and helpmate then when that
moment of madness was upon them both
he had suddenly wounded her acutely sen-
sitive bitterly proud soul by drawing the
bar sinister how she must have suf-
fered he winced at the thought of the
pain he had inflicted she could not be
blamed no the fault was his he ac-
knowledged he should have considered
that he was dealing with a creature of
flesh and blood a woman with youth and
beauty and passion if he believing his
heart was marble could fall so quickly
and so fatally could he censure her

  carver too had warned him not
once but many times almost daily he
had laughed at the warnings later almost
quarreled what should he say if he ever
saw carver again he groaned

  there was a soft swish of skirts ko-
yala stood before him she gazed at him
coldly there was neither hate nor love
in her eyes only indifference in her
hand she held a dagger peter gross re-
turned her gaze without flinching

  you are my prisoner orang blanda
she said  mine only this hut is mine
we are alone here in the jungle except
for one of my people

   you may do with me as you will ko-
yala peter gross replied weariedly

  koyala started and looked at him
keenly

   i have come to carry you away she
announced

   peter gross looked at her in silence

   but first there are many things that
we must talk about she said

  peter gross rose to a sitting posture
 i am listening he announced

  koyala did not reply at once she was
gazing fixedly into his eyes those frank
gray eyes that had so often looked clear-
ly and honestly into hers as he enthusi-
astically spoke of their joint mission in
bulungan a half-sob broke in her throat
but she restrained it fiercely

   do you remember mynheer when we
first met she asked

   it was at the mouth of the abbas
river was it not at wolangs village

   why did you laugh at me then she
exclaimed fiercely

  peter gross looked at her in astonish-
ment  i laughed at you he exclaimed

   yes on the beach when i told you
you must go you laughed do not
deny it you laughed  the fierce inten-
sity of her tone betrayed her feeling

  peter gross shook his head while his
gaze met hers frankly  i do not recol-
lect he said  i surely did not laugh
at you-i do not know what it was-
a light hroke upon him  aye to be
sure i remember now it was a dyak
the argus pheasant



boy with a mountain goat he was drink-
ing milk from the teats dont you re-
call

  you are trying to deceive me ko-
yala cried angrily  you laughed be-
cause-because-

   as god lives it is the truth

  koyala placed the point of her dagger
over peter grosss heart

   orang blanda she said  i have
swpm to kill you if you lie to me in any
single particular to-day i did not see
that whereof you speak there was no
boy no goat quick now the truth if
you would save your life

  peter gross met her glance fearlessly
 i have told you why i laughed ko-
yala he replied  i can tell you noth-
ing different

  the point of the dagger pricked the
residents skin

   then you would rather die

  peter gross merely stared at her ko-
yala drew a deep breath and drew back
the blade

   first we shall talk of other things
she said

  at that moment the rattle of rifle-fire
reached peter grosss ears

    what is that he cried

  koyala laughed a low laugh of exul-
tation  that mynheer is the children
of bulungan driving the white peccaries
from borneo

   ah sing has attacked peter gross
could not help in his excitement letting
a note of his dismay sound in his voice

   ah sing and his pirates koyala
cried triumphantly  wobanguli and
the warriors of bulungan lkath and his
sadong dyaks the malays from the
coast towns all bulungan except the hill
people they are all there as many as
the sands of the seashore and they have
the orang blanda from holland and the
javanese and the loud-voiced orang blan-
da that you brought with you penned in
van slycks kampong none will es-
cape

   thank god carvers in the fort pe-
ter gross ejaculated

   but they cannot escape koyala in-
sisted fiercely

   we shall see peter gross replied
great as were the odds he felt confident
of carvers ability to hold out a few days
anyway he had yet to learn of the ar-
tillery ah sing commanded

   not one shall escape koyala reite-
rated thetigerish light glowing in her
eyes  ah sing has pledged it to me
wobanguli has pledged it to me the last
orang blanda shall be driven from bulun-
gan she clutched the hilt of her dagger
fiercely

  amazed at her vehemence peter gross
watched the shifting display of emotion
on her face

   koyala he said suddenly  why do
you hate us whites so

  he shrank before the fierce glance she
cast at him

   is there any need to ask she cried
violently  did i not tell you the first
day we met when i told you i asked no
favors of you and would accept none
what have you and your race brought to
my people and to me but misery and
more misery you came with fair prom-
ises how have you fulfilled them in the
orang blanda way falsehood upon false-
hood taking all giving none why dont
i kill you now when i have you in my
power when i have only to drop my hand
thus- she flashed the dagger at peter
grosss breast- and i will be revenged
why because i was a fool white man
because i listened to your lies and be-
lieved when all my days i have sworn i
would not so i have let you live un-
less- she did not finish the thought
but stood in rigid attention listening to
the increasing volume of rifle-fire

   they are wiping it out in blood
there she said softly to herself  the
wrongs of bulungan what my unhappy
country has suffered from the orang blan-
da

  peter grosss head was bowed humbly

all-story weekly

thought you worked with me for bulun-
gan and bulungan only with no thought
of self so i worked yet somehow my
plans went wrong the people did not
trust me i tried to relieve them of un-
just taxes they would not let me take
the census i tried to end raiding there
were always disorders and i could not
find the guilty i found a murderer for
lkath among his own people yet he
drove me away i cannot understand it
 do you know why koyala ex-
claimed exultingly  do you know why
you failed it was i-i-i who worked
against you the orang kayas sent their
runners to me and said  shall we give
the controlleur the count of our people
and i said  no djath forbids to the
rajas and gustis i said  let there be
wars we must keep the ancient valor of
our people lest they become like the jav-
anese a nation of slaves you almost
tricked lkath into taking the oath but
in the night i went to him and said

 shall the vulture rest in the eagles nest
and he drove you away

  peter gross stared at her with eyes
that saw not the house of his faith was
crumbling into ruins yet he scarcely real-
ized it himself the revelation of her per-
fidy had come so suddenly he groped
blindly for salvage from the wreck cry-
ing

   but you saved my life-three times
she saw his suffering and smiled so
she had been made to suffer not once
but a thousand times

-	 that was because i had sworn the
revenge should be mine not ah sings or
any one elses orang blanda

  peter gross lowered his face in the
shadow he did not care to have her
see how great had been his disillusion-
ment how deep was his pain

   you may do with me as you will juf-
jrouw he said

  koyala looked at him strangely a mo-
ment then rose silently and left the hut
peter gross never knew the reason it
was because at that moment when she
revealed her dyak treachery and uproot-

ed his faith he spoke to her as he would
to a white woman- juffrouw

   they are holding out yet peter
gross said to himself cheerfully some time
later as the sound of scattered volleys was
wafted over the hills presently he heard
the dull boom of the first shell his face
paled

  that is artillery he exclaimed
 can it be- he remembered the
heavy guns on the proas and his face be-
came whiter still he began tugging at
his bonds but they were too firmly
bound his dyak guard looked in and
grinned and he desisted as time passed
and the explosion continued uninterrupt-
edly his face became haggard and more
haggard it wtas because of his folly he
told himself that men were dying there-
brave carver so much abler and more
foresighted than he the ever-cheerful
paddy all those he had brought with
him good men and true he choked

  presently the shell-fire ceased peter
gross knew what it meant in imagina-
tion he saw the columns of natives form-
ing column upon column all that vast
horde of savages and worse than savages
let loose on a tiny square of wthites

  a figure stood in the doorway it was
koyala cho seng stood beside her

   the walls are down she cried tri-
umphantly  there is only a handful of
them left the people of bulungan are
now forming for the charge in a few
minutes you will be the only white man
left in bulungan

   i and captain van slyck peter
gross said scornfully

   he is dead koyala replied  ah
sing killed him he was of no further
use to us why should he live

  peter grosss lips tightened grimly the
traitor at least had met the death he
merited

  cho seng edged nearer peter gross
noticed the dagger hilt protruding from
his blouse

   has my time come too he asked
calmly

  the chinaman leaped on him  ah
the argus pheasant



sing sends you this he cried hoarsely-
the dagger flashed

  quick as he was quick as a tiger strik-
ing its prey the argus pheasant was
quicker as the dagger descended ko-
yala caught him by the wrist he struck
her with his free hand and tried to tear
the blade away then his legs doubled
under him for peter gross although his
wrists were bound could use his arms
he fell on the point of the dagger that
buried itself to the hilt in the fleshy part
of his breast with a low groan he rolled
over his eyeballs rolled glassily upward
thick choked sounds came from his
throat-

   ah sing - comeee - for koyala-
plenty quick- with a sigh he died

  peter gross looked at the argus pheas-
ant she was gazing dully at a tiny
scratch on her forearm a scratch made
by cho sengs dagger the edges were
purplish

   the dagger was poisoned she mur-
mured dully her glance met her prison-
ers and she smiled wanly

   i go to sangjang with you mynheer
she said

  peter gross staggered to his knees and
caught her arm before she comprehend-
ed what he intended to do he had his lips
upon the cut and was sucking the blood
a scarlet tide flooded her face then fled
leaving her cheeks with the pallor of
death 

   no no she cried choking and tried
to tear her arm away but in peter
grosss firm grasp she was like a child
after a franticfutile struggle she yield-
ed her face was bloodless as a corpse
and she stared glassily at the wall

  presently peter gross released her

   it was only a scratch he said gently
 i think we have gotten rid of the poi-
son

  the sound of broken sobbing was his
only answer

   koyala he exclaimed

  with a low moan she ran out of the
hut leaving him alone with the dead body
of the chinaman already bloated purpl

  peter gross listened again only the
ominous silence from the hills the silence
that foretold the storm he wondered
where koyala was and his heart became
hot as he recollected cho sengs farewell
message that ah sing was coming well
ah sing would find him find him bound
and helpless the pirate chief would at
last have his long-sought revenge for
some inexplicable reason he felt glad that
koyala was not near the jungle was
her best protection he knew

  a heavy explosion cut short his rever-
ies  they are cannonading again he
exclaimed in surprise but as another ter-
rific crash sounded a moment later his
face became glorified wild cries of ter-
ror sounded over the hills dyak cries
mingled with the shrieking and explosion
of shrapnel-

   its the prins peter gross exclaimed
jubilantly  thank god captain enc-
kel came on time

  he tugged at his own bonds in a frenzy
of hope exerting all his great strength to
strain them sufficiently to permit him to
slip one hand free but they were too
tightly bound presently a shadow fell
over him he looked up with a start ex-
pecting to see the face of the chinese
arch-murderer ah sing instead it was
koyala

   let me help you she said huskily
with a stroke of her dagger she cut the
cord another stroke cut the bonds that
tied his feet he sprang up a free man

   hurry koyala he cried catching
her by the arm  ah sing may be here
any minute

  koyala gently disengaged herself

   ah sing is in the jungle far from
here she said

  a silence fell upon them both her
eyes averted from his sought the ground
he stood by struggling for adequate ex-
pression

   where are you going koyala he
finally asked she had made no move-
ment to go

   wherever you will mynheer she re-
plied quietly  i am now your prisoner
	all-story weekly

  peter gross stared a moment in aston-
ishment  my prisoner he repeated
 nonsense

   your people have conquered myn-
heer she said  mine are in flight
therefore i have come to surrender my-
self-to you

   i do not ask your surrender peter
gross replied gravely beginning to un-
derstand

   you do not ask it mynheer but some
one must suffer for what has happened
some one must pay the victors prize i
am responsible i incited my people so
i offer myself in their stead they are
innocent and should not be made to
suffer

   ah sing is responsible peter gross
said firmly  and i

   you mynheer  the question came
from koyalas unwilling lips before she
realized it

  yes i juffrouw it is best that we
forget what has happened-i must begin
my work over again he closed his lips
firmly there were lines of pain in his face
 that is he added heavily  if his ex-
cellency will permit me to remain here
after this fiasco

   you will stay here koyala asked
incredulously

   yes and you juffrouw 

  a moments silence  my place is
with my people-if you do not want me
as hostage mynheer 

  peter gross took a step forward and
placed a hand on her shoulder she trem-
bled violently

   i have a better work for you juf-
frouw he said

  her eyes lifted slowly to meet his
there was mute interrogation in the
glance

   to help me make bulungan peaceful
and prosperous he said

  koyala shook herself free and walked
toward the door peter gross did not
molest her she stood on the threshold
one hesitating foot on the jungle path that
led to the grove of big banyans for
some minutes she remained there then

she slowly turned and with pale set face
reentered the hut

   mynheer gross she said in a chok-
ing voice  before i met you i believed
that all the orang blanda were vile i
hated the white blood that was in me
many times i yearned to take it from me
drop by drop many times i stood on the
edge of precipices undecided whether to
let it nourish my body longer or no only
one thing kept me from death the
thought that i might avenge the wrongs
of my unhappy country and my unhap-
py mother

  a stifled sob shook her after a mo-
ment or two she resumed

   then you came i prayed the hanu
token to send a young man a young
man who would desire me after the man-
ner of white men when i saw you i
knew you as the man of the abbas the
man who had laughed and i thought the
hanu token had answered my prayer i
saved you from wobanguli i saved you
from ah sing that you might be mine
mine only to torture her voice broke
again

   but you disappointed me you were
just you were kind righteous in all your
dealings considerate of me you did not
seek to take me in your arms even when
i came to you in your own dwelling you
did not taunt me with my mother like that
pig van slyck-

   he is dead peter gross interrupted
gently

   i have no sorrow for him sangjang
has waited over long for him now you
come to me after all that has happened
and say  koyala will you forget and
help me make bulungan happy  what
shall i answer mynheer 

  she looked at him humbly entreating-
ly peter gross smiled his familiar con-
fident warming smile

   what your conscience dictates
koyala

  she breathed rapidly at last came
her answer a low whisper  if you wish
it i will help you mynheer

  peter gross reached out his hand and
the argus pheasant



caught hers  then were pards again
he cried

chapter xxx

the governors promise

peter gross had just concluded
an account of his administration in
bulungan to governor-general van
schouten at the latters paleis in batavia
the governor-general was frowning

   so mynheer he exclaimed gruffly
 this is not a very happy report you
have brought me

  peter gross bent his head

   no census not a cent of taxes paid
piracy murders my controlleurs - god
knows where they are the whole province
in revolt this is a nice kettle of fish
sachsen glanced sympathetically at
peter gross the lad he loved so well sat
with bowed head and clenched hands
lines of suffering marked his face he had
grown older oh so much older during
those few sorry months since he had so
confidently declared his policies for the
regeneration of the residency in this very
room the governor was speaking again

   you said you would find mynheer de
jonges murderer for me van schouten
rasped  have you done that

   yes your excellency it was kapi-
tein van slyck who planned the deed and
cho seng who committed the act pricked
him with a upas thorn while he slept as i
told your excellency here are my proofs
a statement made by mynheer muller to
captain carver and lieutenant banning
before he died and a statement made by
koyala to me he gave the governor
the documents the latter scanned them
briefly and laid them aside

   how did muller come to his death
he demanded

   like a true servant of the state fight-
ing in defense of the fort peter gross
replied  a splinter of a shell struck him
in the body

  h-m the governor grunted i
thought he was one of these traitors too

   he expiated his crimes two weeks
ago at fort wilhelmina your excellency
 and cho seng the governor de-
manded  is he still alive

   he fell on his own dagger peter
gross described the incident  it was
not the dagger thrust that killed him he
explained  that made only a flesh
wound but the dagger point had been
dipped in a cobras venom softly he
added  he always feared that he would
die from a snakes poison

   it is the judgment of god van
schouten pronounced solemnly he
looked at peter gross sharply

   now this koyala he asked  where
is she

   i do not know in the hills among
her own people i think she will not
trouble you again

  the governor stared at his resident
gradually the stern lines of his face re-
laxed and a quaintly humorous glint
came into his eyes

   so mynheer gross the woman de-
ceived you he asked sharply

  peter gross made no reply the gov-
ernors eyes twinkled he suddenly
brought down his fist on the table wfth a
resounding bang

   donder en bliksem  he exclaimed
 i cannot find fault with you for that
the fault is mine i should have known
better why when i was your age a
pretty woman could strip the very but-
tons from my dress coat-dammit myn-
heer gross you must have had a heart of
ice to withstand her so long

  he flourished a highly colored silk
handkerchief and blew his nose loudly and
lustily

   so you are forgiven on that count
mynheer gross now for the other it
appears that by your work you have cre-
ated a much more favorable feeling to-
ward us among many of the natives
the hill dyaks did not rise against us as
they have always done before and some
of the coast dyak tribes were loyal that
buzzard lkath stayed in his lair fur-
thermore you have solved the mysteries


all-story weekly

that have puzzled us for years and the
criminals have been muzzled lastly
you were the honey that attracted all
these piratical pests into bulungan har-
bor where kapitein enckel was able to
administer them a blow that will sweep
those seas clear of this vermin for years
to come i believe you have not done
so badly after all mynheer gross of
course you and your twenty-five men
might have come to grief had not sach-
sen here heard reports that caused me
to send the prins lodewyk post-haste to
bulungan but we will overlook your too
great confidence on the score of your
youth- he chuckled-  now as to
the future-

the

  he paused and looked smilingly into
the eyes that looked so gratefully into his

   what say you to two more years at
bulungan mynheer to straighten out af-
fairs there work out your policies and
finish what you have so ably begun

   your excellency is too good peter
gross murmured brokenly

  good van schouten snapped
 donder en bliksem mynheer it is only
that i know a man when i see him can
you go back next week

   yes your excellency

   then see that you do and see to it
that those devils send me some rice this
year when the tax falls due or i will hang
them all in the good old-fashioned way

eternal vigilance is the price of
vogue old bill dinsley kept
paying it right along that is
why at fifty odd he was still accounted
the  old fox  among the track coaches
of the country and the sporting editors
frequently marked his name for box-car
type old bill ferret eyed and of master-
ly cunning continued to deliver the goods

  upon a day when winter retained a
hammerlock on spring and the snows still
fell upon the valley and hills upon which

sprawled the city of perlham bill dinsley
looked over his awkward squad of re-
cruits in the gymnasium of the university
as from time immemorial signalizing this
important occasion his lean crinkled face
looked more so as he sadly shook his head
he delivered the ancient judgment any
of the alumni would have grinned had you
repeated it to them

   well i got to do the best i can with
what i got i suppose come on out till
i get a line on ye
gingering jerry



  and according to the traditions of perl-
ham from away back he led forth that
squad of striplings for their initial
scamper bundled in a heavy jersey
wearing unpulchritudinous pants and
heavy shoes and with soft black hat
drawn down over his eyes he led the
squad the storied race that always won
from his  fresh  recruits their whole-
some respect the very first day

  old bills tryouts were invariably in the
nature of obstacle races as always the
members of the squad trailing along in
sweaters and flapping running-pants and
stepping through the snow in low shoes
grinned at the easy indianlike lope over
smooth going which the veteran affected

  presently bill swerved off the comfort-
able highway leading toward fabius and
leaped a stone wall the boys following
like a flock of sheep the way led across
a frozen plowed field a few slowed up
to pick their steps but with definite sur-
prise resumed the lope as they noted the
coach continuing across the bumpy reaches
with no diminution of pace

  he came to a steep hill he walked up
it as fast asthe ordinary man would walk
down already some of the youths be-
hind him were sounding like asthmatic
automobiles serene leather-lunged his
furrowed face as expressionless as a mum-
mys dinsley instantly resumed his easy
swinging lope of all the company
which followed him all but two or three
were already in difficulties

  not only did the famous old coach re-
quire his neophytes to do no more than he
did himself but at the outset of the sea-
sons work he invariably made allowances
for the stragglers-up to a certain point

  arrived back at the gymnasium after a
grueling scamper of four miles he nodded
approvingly at the dozen lithe-limbed
young athletes who had weathered the
pace with him one trio standing to-
gether he favored with a dry grin tom
ford tim dyer and jack litscom had
beaten him out by little more than inches
in the final dash to the gymnasium steps

  all the company however were heaving

like wind-broken horses the big en-
closure sounded as if filled with bicycle
pumps in action old bill stood with
sinewy chest rising and falling under the
tight jersey in rhythmic iteration he
had it over every one of his boys it was
a matter of pride with him to keep himself
as hard as nails the year round

   go on and strip an shower he told
them succinctly an mind ye rub
down well afterward

  then he drew out his watch and stood
waiting for the stragglers one of the
seniors who stood looking on explained to
a pair of curious neophytes his reason for
this

   hell allow the late arrivals three min-
utes he said  any one who comes
staggering in after that he wont bother
with he never does

  surely enough old bill stood there
watch in hand mentally noting the late
arrivals till the time mentioned had
elapsed then he left the gymnasium
steps passing indifferently some dejected
youths who loafed in panting at what
was practically the eleventh minute

  suddenly just as the coach was about
to descend the hill near the end of the
college campus toward his home a red-
haired youth approached him at a lagging
walk he was encased in a wonderful red
and black sweater and running trunks and
shoes he was liberally freckled he had
most attractive dark-blue eyes

  right here old bill dinsley violated all
his established precedent he glanced
into the attractive eyes of this otherwise
homely tailender of the bunch and
stopped so did the novice

  dinsley was famous for his few words
 spavined he inquired

  it was at once evident that verbal
greek had met greek

   heaves replied the youth his mot-
tled face was as expressionless as old bills

   whats yer name

   jerry heath

   hm-m-m

  dinsley looked him over there was
apparently no reason on earth why this


all-story weekly

gangling slim-legged gosling should not be
able to run like a scared cat

   where you from

   homer

   cigarettes

   some

   thought so

  old bill looked straight into blue eyes
that gave him glance for glance  cut
em out he questioned

   yes

   stick to it  laconically encouraged
old bill  make the training table

  he walked down the hill jerry heath
ran the remainder of the way to the gym-
nasium

  for the next few days dinsley appeared
to pay no attention to the recruit who con-
tinued to work with the squad despite the
fact that he had been last to finish the
initial run the others wondered at this
departure from the usual and some of
them questioned the freshman  he told
me to keep on was the only reply given
by the youth who in the students estima-
tion was already running a  slow race 
with the coach in the matter of a limited
vocabulary

  two weeks after the initial run dinsley
made a slashing cut in the squad the
suni kors ordered to the training table in-
eluded ford dyer litscom and the
spangled jerry heath

  the next day ford standing with dins-
ley at the gymnasium steps unloaded vol-
uble thanks and assurances of mighty
deeds to come

   your wind is all right acknowledged
old bill as the athlete finished  save it
for the track work

  ford retired thinking it over dins-
leys eyes twinkled across to those of a
youth sitting on the steps little imps in
the eyes of heath wigwagged back

  the college world was watching perl-
ham which had won the intercollegiates
at philadelphia the previous season by a
good margin of points a new national
mark had been set by danby perlhams
great miler in that event with featherly
his varsity mate close up and danziger

the vale crack third since then the two
perlham stars had graduated danziga
now a senior was generally picked by the
experts to win the mile run at the coming
intercollegiates in june it was not be-
lieved that old bill dinsley stellar coach
though he was could develop from raw
material another man capable of securing
a look-in at the mile

  perlhams candidates for the intercol-
legiates would be determined by the re-
sults of its own meet early in may the
first two or three to qualify according to
event to be eligible

  it gradually developed that jerry heath
was dinsleys favorite candidate for the
mile and because jerry was as wholly un-
like the average college athlete-who fiz-
zes like summer soda-as possible this
caused much comment he took his track
work as he did his books with seriousness
he  mixed  like a hermit and chatted
like the sphinx

  he was not at all surly however merely
silent science teaches us that the re-
verberations of the human voice together
with the putt-putts of motor-boats the
chuggings of flivvers and the whole bar-
gain sale of earthly sounds forever echo
through space jerry heath contributed
but little to this ghostly anvil-chorus

  old bill bestowed much time upon him
this brought to the stolid heath person-
ality no visible preening he just plugged
along the little fiends which whispered
in the ears of other athletes emphasizing
the joys of breaking training rules took
one look at the sober jerry visage and
hopped onto the others

  but with all his earnestness his wiry
legs his  bellows  improved by the dis-
carding of cigarettes jerrys work in some
elements failed to satisfy dinsley the
coach continued his laconic pointers
jerry strove to comply but often in
watching him the dinsley eyes puckered
and the dinsley brow scowled

  he thought perhaps the irritating lack
might be due to physical reaction with
this reflection his thoughts naturally
leaped to the item of diet his assistant
gingering jerry



dowd always sat with the boys at the
training table but upon an afternoon
dinsley telephoned his landlady that he
would not be home for supper

  he sat at the head of the board with
the squad soon after casting a cursory
glance over the satisfying of healthy ap-
petites his sharp gaze became riveted on
one man

  jerry was first away from the table
old bill a close second tapped him on
the shoulder as they stepped out into the
veranda

   you eat too fast alleged bill

   do i

   yes you gobbled your steak like a
lion an spinach aint a gargle youre
supposed to inhale it slow

  jerry looked solemn

   gobblin hurts yer work concluded
bill  take yer time

   i will promised heath

  thereafter he  fletcherized  to an ex-
tent that irritated maids waiting to clear
the table

  jerrys workouts improved but the
shrewd eyes that watched his red-haired
find continued to pucker and the brows to
scowl as the days passed he had dis-
covered that the item of too speedy eating
now corrected had not been the dig ob-
stacle in the development of his prospect

  the trouble was not in the stomach it
lay at a point to the left of that organ

  when circling the stadium track alone
jerry was a modern mercury when
traveling with others the little imps of
doubt and indecision attached to his plod-
ding heels leaden weights

  old bill had run across these fellows
before equipped with everything needed
by the runner except the all-important
item of heart many such after he had
become wholly convinced had been
dropped quick

  the varsity meet which would deter-
mine the intercollegiate contenders was a
week away often under such circum-
stances he had laconically dismissed some
embryonic crack from the training table
and only they two had known why

  across the table from him it seemed as
if the youth with the attractive eyes sat
silent awaiting his decision

  should he go on with what he was now
convinced was a forlorn hope or should
he adhere to his rule hitherto inviolate
and drop the lad who lacked the great
requisite of the game

  dinsley ceased to ponder slow fire
gathered in his eyes his big fist thumped
on the table

   hes got to make good he muttered
and filled up his pipe

  the next afternoon when jerry finished
in the ruck of a practise-mile scamper led
by dyer and litscom dinsley took him
aside

   tired he asked

   no

   anything holdin ye

   not as i know

  old bills eyes searched his own  yes
there is its yourself

  a moment the frank eyes suddenly
troubled endured the piercing gaze that
bared the souls of men then jerrys gaze
dropped

  he knew of dinsleys custom of merci-
lessly weeding up to the last minute he
stood silently awaiting dismissal

  at last old bill spoke  you can beat
em all do it

   ill try answered heath

  light work marked the remainder of the
week all dinsleys athletes were in the
pink of condition for the coming tests in
the public mind and among the student
body interest centered in the mile run

  for this event dinsleys knife had left
seven contenders out of thirty original
aspirants the first three men across the
tape would be perlhams entries for the
mile run at the intercollegiates a month
later there were no trial heats a single
race would determine the personnel of the
team

  the big saturday arrived it was a
lovely may day the warm sun flamed
the lofty surrounding hills were robed in
cool green fleecy clouds scurried across
the blue sky


all-story weekly

  all perlham and its environs thronged
the great stadium the students section
was ablaze with red and black before
the collegians capered the cheer leaders
busy with megaphones and rhythmically
swinging arms the lusty chorus pealed
songs and college yells

  before the start of the program many
eyes sought old bill dinsley he was
striding back and forth on the cinder
track in front of the covered portion of the
concrete enclosure he wore a flamboyant
golfing cap pulled well over his eyes his
hands thrust in the pockets of his norfolk
jacket

  the starters pistol cracked for the
opening dash a general yelp of joy
sounded as a half dozen scantily clad
youths bounded away

  event after event was reeled off the
time made the distance of hammer hurl-
ings and shot puts the height achieved in
the pole vaults all these indicated that
perlham would be worthily represented at
the intercollegiates

  the mile run was the last contest
scheduled public attention was at a
painful tensity seven men crouched at
the line the magnets for thousands of
eyes there could be plainly heard the
murmur of the light may breeze the
flaring red and black colors of the stu-
dents section lay idle the cheer leaders
faced about megaphones in their hands
staring with the rest the starter stood
back of the entrants his pistol raised

  in all that company not a human being
was stirring in this tense instant but one
old bill dinsley was walking from the
finish line in front of the covered stand
to the opposite side of the track

  he did not pause as the pistol cracked
and a mighty roar ascended he did not
look back as he reached his point of
vantage the leader for the first half-lap
flashed past him

  he was dyer ten feet behind him was
litscom the others were grouped far
back jerry heath was sixth he was
running as smoothly as if with oiled bear-
ings

  if he noticed his mentor he did not
evidence it he flashed by in splendid
form with a superb mechanical action as
though wound with a key

  when the runners sped by dinsley
again heath was fifth but dyer and lits-
com had increased their lead on the others
they seemed determined to make a run-
away race of it the throng cheered their
efforts but many eyes watched heath
curiously was it not time for old bills
rumored  find  to show

  as jerry passed the coach forthe sec-
ond time-apparently still unnoting his
presence-dinsley scowled most prodigi-
ously he turned and walked up along
the oval green that fringed the track he
was headed for the lower turn

  as he strode he looked across the oval
dyer flashed by the mark half his journey
completed with litscom at his elbow
dinsley noticed that the gallant pair had
gained a little on the others in the last
half-lap a deepening roar ascended as
they sped for the lower turn

  jerry heath was now third well ahead
of the remaining four stragglers who fal-
tered in the murderous pace but heath
was apparently hopelessly distanced by
the pair of flying meteors fighting it out
ahead

  the third lap was well underway the
beginning of the end on this quarter-mile
track

  old bill dinsley had nearly reached
the turn when he whirled and stood wait-
ing with set teeth and gleaming eyes
arms and legs working like pistons dyer
and litscom shot by him now shoulder to
shoulder going at a terrific clip far in
their wake came jerry heath running
without perceptible effort every stride
leaving the four discouraged  trailers 
far behind

  the coach stood with blazing eyes wait-
ing for him his lean jaws snapped to-
gether like those of a nutcracker his big
hands were clenched he crouched as if he
were about to hurl himself upon the ad-
vancing runner

  instead as heath flashed alongside
gingering jerry



dinsley whirled and ran along the strip
of green beside him the lean jaws
opened a miracle occurred from that
mouth which had for years dropped spar-
ingly single syllables there issued a tor-
rent of them merging in a scourging
thong a roweling spur to action

  you eight-day clock bawled old
bill as he raced stride for stride with this
fading phenomenon  you stationary
engine you run like you was skippin a
rope some one ought to put a dress on
you wheres your doll and hoop
youre that yellow you hurt my eyes
trail in you heartless wonder and then
go die some one ought to tow you in
i picked out your mother in the stand
i know cause she was hidin her face

  for once the speckled face turned to old
bills sneering visage with an expression
of flaring hatred then it tensed in an
expression it had never worn before the
red head bent as if to charge a whole
army there was a flash of a hurtling
form and a deep-throated roar from the
crowd as jerry heath left his racing men-
tor in a most discourteous hurry

  old bill came to a halt a wry smile
crinkled the corners of his mouth he
strolled slowly across the oval watching
his galvanized fiend tearing after those
twoflying leaders at every giant stride
cutting down the intervening distance

  the trio sped by the mark and squared
away for the final quarter the great
stadium shook with thunderous sound in
a half-lap jerry heath had cut down a
third of the distance toward that ap-
proaching lead

  in the center of the oval the veteran
whirled slowly his glowing puckered eyes
like those thousands of other eyes riveted
upon the long-legged whirlwind now eat-
ing up distance in prodigious strides the
coachs gaze flashed for an instant to the
stop-watch in his hand set with the shot
of the starters pistol then alternately
watching it and the runners he walked
swiftly over to the line as the men tore
around the lower turn into the stretch

 while men shouted and women

screamed while collegians danced as if de-
mented and megaphones and caps were
thrown high in air dinsley stood stoically
by the timers stop-watch in hand a red-
haired fury came flying down the stretch
already lengths in advance of dyer and
litscom still close together but blown

  past a massed screaching lane of hu-
manity flew jerry heath speckled features
mobilized in a vengeful grin teeth flashing
like those of the carnivori glaring eyes
temporarily unattractive faster and
faster he came his spikes spurning the
cinders gathering force with every stride
he covered the last hundred yards as if
the race had been for that distance while
the craning thousands wholly parted with
the poise of sanity with upflung arms he
broke the tape as dyer just entered the
shadow of the covered section

  old bill stop-watch in hand leaned
toward the timers  what d ye make
it he bawled above the din

  their watches matched his own not
only had jerry smashed all university rec-
ords his time was a full two-fifths of a
second better than the intercollegiate rec-
ord established by danby heaths prede-
cessor of perlham the year before

  the tumult died long enough to allow
the announcement of this fact then it
was doubled tripled and quadrupled
jerry still glaring would have liked a
word with old bill instead he was made
the helpless center of a human vortex and
rose out of the whirlpool like a flurried
nymph perched protesting upon jubilant
shoulders

  jerry sat that evening in the parlor of
the hotel five nations upon the sofa
next his chair sat bolt upright and with
primly folded hands a plump pretty little
woman with brown hair softly tinged with
gray she had beautiful eyes jerrys
eyes were like hers

  there came a hesitant step they
turned to behold old bill dinsley standing
in the doorway

  at sight of the little woman bill crossed
to the sofa in two giant strides his big
hand eagerly sought her own gave it one

awkward shake and dropped it he
turned to jerry their hands met hard

   mad asked bill

  there crossed jerrys face the most
spontaneous grin that had ever visited it
no he exclaimed fervently

  he turned to the little woman  im
going out ma he said  ill be right
back

  old bill took the chair jerry had seat-
ed the little woman gazed at him with
shining eyes dinsley with an effort
leaped into conversation of limited
syllables

   its been a long time

   yes she answered  going on
thirty years in sparing conversation as
well as in the item of eyes jerry was the
son of his mother

   i saw you in the stand he continued
 id known you anywhere

   id known you too i saw you on the
track

   did you know i was coachin him

   no he dont write much he didnt
want me to come afraid he wouldnt
win i find he just told me what you
said to him

  old bill grinned  hes some kid
win the intercollegiate sure

   i hope so her warm smile belied
her calm words

  across his lined face a shadow drifted
 hope he wins all lifes races i lost one
the bigone

  she sat silent with nervous folded
hands her frank eyes a little misty

   we never said much bill went on
 if we talked a little more it might have
been as well

   it might conceded the little woman
her tone held a hint of reserve

  hurriedly bill skated off the ice  i
knew jerry when he started training be-
fore i knew his name knew him by the
eyes theyre yours

   ive been told so she answered
primly

   made up my mind he couldnt lose
with a mother like you i made him
win 

  you certainly did now her tone
was as spontaneous as a girls her sweet
eyes glowed while little pink banners
flaunted in her soft round cheeks

  dinsley asked his next question with an
effort  wheres-his father he here
with you

   mr heath she answered a little
hesitatingly  oh didnt you ever hear
he died when jerry was five of course
you wouldnt know you went out west
years ago it didnt-turn out-very
well

  old bills lined face was heavy with the
shadow of many years that in this mo-
ment seemed irretrievably wasted  it-
didnt he stammered and paused

   we bury those things with the dead
she supplied with gentle dignity  i
brought up jerry i took in sewing we
got along he earned his money for col-
lege

  suddenly dinsleys face grew lighter
hope once more glowed in his bachelor
breast after all there were some years
ahead

   when you going back to homer he
ventured

   to-morrow

  bill cleared his throat  whats the
use of goin back

   what do you mean she queried

   i aint never married will you marry

me

  he sat fidgeting with his hat as self-
conscious as a boy in his best suit his
eyes sought her face grown pink as a
young girls she sat with downcast gaze
her hands twisted in her lap together
they resurrected a past which in this mo-
ment seemed as yesterday

  finally she looked up at him and her
eyes also were like a young girls

   yes she told him

  he dropped his hat and grasped her
hands

   when

   well she replied her voice as frank
as her eyes  i dont care if i never go
back to homer i can send for my
things
wth every passing day the wild places of the earth grow fewer each rising sun
sees the reclamation of some great waste visibly advanced civilization
that for centuries crawled slowly painfully forward now aided by steam
electricity-and high-power guns strides onward resistless inexorable trolley-cars
run where a few years ago savages roamed at will cities rise in deserts that for ages
had borne no greater burden than the feet of an occasional and hardy adventurer

    about asia and africa the bonds are tightening the rod of the surveyor has
banished the mystery of the great amazon valley only the great frozen north holds
out and even there the steel and wire tentacles of civilization are pushing onward it
is still unconquered however vast silent iron-hard cruel and remorseless and as the
country so the men-and women-it produces for here as nowhere else the doctrine of
the survival of the fittest is exemplified only the fit-the perfectly fit-can survive

    so naturally when we want a hero-a real hero of epic proportions of red blood
and iron soul-we turn to the country that produces such men-the great northwest
it is here that our new five-part serial which begins next week is laid it is called-

the gun brand

by james b hendryx
author of  the promise  the one big thing  marquard the silent etc

and certainly no one is better qualified to tell the story of such a hero-and heroine- -
than this author as those of you who have read any of his other stories will testify
bob macnair- brute  macnair as he is called-is the hero born at the hudson
bay post of which his father was a factor he becomes a free-trader upon his fathers
death and the influence of his powerful personality is soon felt throughout the north
the heroine chloe elliston is a city and college-bred girl but in her veins runs the
blood of old  tiger  elliston whose heroic work in the conquest and civilization of
the malay archipelago was second only to that of brooke the elder and it is the drive
of this restless unconquerable blood that has sent her into the heart of the wild atha-
basca country to bring education and civilization to the indians

     i am not going to tell you a thing about this story it would be impossible to do so
without to some extent anticipating but i will say that from beginning to end it is
full of strongly dramatic situations vivid pictures of life in that land of ice and iron
and some of the most splendid characters you have met in a long time-pierre lapierre
for instance the polished college-bred quarter-breed free-trader and big lena chloes
gigantic and faithful swedish maid nor must we forget wee johnny tamarack
macnairs old indian henchman and the half-breed louis lefroy who- but that
is enough only do not fail to get next weeks all-story and begin this wonderful
story

did you read  narcissus by horatio
winslow in the october  number of
this magazine one enthusiastic fan wrote in to
say that he had studied latin and greek authors
in the original but had never in all his experi-
ence read such an accurate and convincing pic-
ture of ancient rome as was contained in that
story and as far as ye editor was concerned
he crowned the novelette forthwith as being a
hundred per cent perfect technically

  well weve got another  narcissus  for you
next week but as different a story as possible
in almost every way it is-

ozer totis daughter

by jennie haskell rose

  youve read longfellows  saga of king
olaf  in all probability and have been thrilled
through by the stirring verse-of grim vikings
and the rapture of the sea-fight and the capture
and the life of slavery  it was einar tamber-
skelver stood beside the mast from his yew-
bow tipped with silver flew the arrows fast
aimed at eric unavailing as he sat concealed
half behind the quarter-railing half behind his
shield- and the rest and youve read mighty
little fiction of that time and country at that
well venture to say

  ozer totis daughter gunhilda of helgeland
was as real a character as olaf himself though
she lived a hundred years before olafs time
she was as young as she was beautiful at the
period of this story and as deadly dangerous as
she was young her gray-green eyes could
promise all things to a man at one momentand
freeze him the next and when her father the
bonde sent her to lapland to learn magic of
the lapp wizards-

the search for the unexplainable riddle of

liberty or death

by charles b stilson

a  different   story

is the amazingly fantastic conception born in the
mind of therott karker of a souls activity
after death the theory expounded is simply a
theory and makes no pretense to be anything
more than that but it is an astonishingly grip-

ping piece of fiction altogether worthy of a
place in our  different  department

than which no higher praise need be given

 the late figger bush by e k
means is another delightful tickfall comedy
which goes to prove what the persian prince
learned to his sorrow-that it is foolish to flee
from your lion

  riggers lion was a mighty harmless one-or
so it seemed to figger in short it was that
ebony gentlemans granddad but in view of
the fact that figger-about the laziest darky in
tickfall-had trouble enough to keep his own
soul and body together without working he had
no intention whatever of supporting his ancient
 kinnery

  so figger sought the advice and counsel of
skeeter butts and vinegar atts and among
them they cooked up a scheme that you shall
learn all about next week

  consider the oath of mtaga by
achmed abdullah is another story of that re-
markable firm of traders on the west coast of
africa donachie and daud known affectionately
over half the continent as the firm of dd
captain abdullah certainly knows the native of
africa as few do-as no white man but an arab
can-and in this story he introduces you to a
phase of native character in his relation to his
white masters that is as strange as it is in-
teresting lieutenant johnny mortimer was new
to the coast he did not realize-though mah-
moud ali daud the arab member of the firm
of dd endeavored to show him-that there is
a difference between a mission-bred coast negro
and a chief of the bayaka johnny couldnt see
it at all and his blindness cost him- well
that is the story or part of it the other part
daud himself played and that i think is
enough to tell you here but do not fail to read
the story next week it is very much worth
while

 frozen ground by thomas jeffries
betts is an intimate little study of chinese life
that in its way is a little gem-a picture there
are all kinds of pictures in the world big
splashy oils and soft water-colors fine clean-cut
engravings delicate etchings and the ubiquitous
photograph but this story is neither one nor
the other in the truth and minuteness of its detail
it is perhaps photographic but it has also the
subtle softness and charm of a perfect miniature
-and that is exactly what it is and that is
all i am going to tell you about it for it would
be a shame to spoil by even a hint your enjoy-
ment of this little masterpiece next week

to the editor

   i enclose one dollar to continue our subscrip-
tion to the all-story from february 

  my wife and i have been reading the all-
story for two years we read many periodicals
and consider the all-story the best magazine
we can find on any news-stand when we are
traveling we are at home this winter and
while we are a mile and half from the post-
office it is never too cold or stormy to make the
trip on friday to get the all-story

   i wish to congratulate you on the  make-up 
of your magazine and your staff of writers i

can honestly say that i read every issue from
cover to cover and enjoy it immensely of
course every reader of a magazine has his favor-
ite writers-my wife and i find several among
the staff of the all-story

   the brass check  was intensely interest-
ing   the iron rider  kept us anxious for the
next instalment  the black cloud  was grip-

james frederick topping must have had some
experience in the show business to be able to
write his mrs mcjimsey stories-every trouper
can sure appreciate them but dr e k means
is my favorite and like achmed abdullah he
must have  been there and he certainly has
made a study of his subject to me each of his
articles grows more interesting

  may the all-story long continue to enjoy its
well-earned success

to the editor

  i am not an old reader of your fine publica-

you how much ive enjoyed your stories it
was only recently that i got hold of a copy in
fact and what i read there convinced me that
the all-story is about the best magazine going
if it keeps to its present pace ill read it if it
takes my last double-jitney

  not long ago you published in your heart to
heart talks a letter by william rand loescher
i want to say that this young man is a very
good friend of mine and that is the reason i
stopped in his home town holyoke it was
through him i came in contact with all-story
for he is a great reader and a good critic well
to resume he and i used to travel together
and many were the adventures we faced side
by side there were four of us and he was the
acknowledged leader and as a leader he was
about the most reckless cuss who ever crossed
the mexican line and got himself all shot up
before he had sense enough to beat it back to
where he belonged but the best of it was that
no matter what predicament he got himself into
he always managed to get out again and neatly

 he could tell a lot about our travels together
 because he happens to be there in the literary
 line himself and is something of a talker-when
 he gets started

that story about tarzan was good and the
same can be said about  too much efficiency
 nuala omalley  the black cloud  the
yellow furlough  the golden hope  the
brass check  the god of the invincibly strong
arms  jewels and fine gold the e k
means stories  the girl from farriss et
cetera

too many people are kicking about means
and i think it about time to say that he is one
of the best writers on the staff of the all-story

                     very sincerely yours

 although i have been a reader of your stories
 for over a year this is the first letter i have
 written to you to let you know how much i
 enjoy reading the all-story weekly

i think that our readers ought to thank you
as well as the authors for the many good stories
they have given us this last year at least i thank
you because you are responsible for the good
stories	esther thurber

newport kentucky

although i have only been reading the all-
story for several months i cannot but say that
it is the best fiction magazine i have ever read

although some of the stories are highly im-
aginative they are written in a way that makes
one feel oneself a part of the plot the serials
are the best part of the all-story although
some of the short stories are fine

 i would like to see a story with the plot cen-
 tering around wireless telegraphy the best
 stories i have read so far in the all-story are
 the courtship superlative contraband and
  the girl from farriss i think the last-
 named is a masterpiece it sure is some story

how i raised my earnings
fiom  to looo a week

         the story of a young mans
         remarkable rise as told by himself

three years ago i was earning  per
week with a wife and two chifdren to
support it was a constant struggle to
make both ends meet we saved very little and
that only by sacrificing things we really needed
to-day my earnings average a thousand dollars
weekly i own two automobiles my children
go to private schools i have just purchased for
cash a  home i go hunting fishing
motoring traveling whenever i care to and i
do less work than ever before

  what i have done anyone can do-for i am
only an average man i have never gone to col-
lege my education is limited and i am not  bril-
liant  by any means i personally know at least
a hundred men who are better business men than
i who are better educated who are better in-
formed on hundreds of subjects and who have
much better ideas than i ever had yet not one
of them approaches my earnings i mention this
merely to show that earning capacity is not gov-
erned by the extent of a mans education and to
convince my readers that there is only one reason
for my success-a reason i will give herein

  one day a few years ago i began to  take
stock  of myself i found that like most other
men i had energy ambition determination yet
in spite of these assets for some reason or other
i drifted along without getting anywhere my
lack of education bothered me and i had thought
seriously of making further sacrifices in order to
better equip myself to earn more then i read
somewhere that but few millionaires ever went to
college edison rockefeller hill schwab car-
negie-not one of them had any more schooling
than i had

  one day something happened that woke me up
to what was wrong with me it was necessary for
me to make a decision on a matter which was of
no great consequence i knew in my heart what
was the right thing to do but something held me
back i said one thing then another i decided
one way then another i couldnt for the life of
me make the decision i knew was right

  i lay awake most of that night thinking about
the matter-not because it was of any great im-
portance in itself but because i was beginning to
discover myself along towards dawn i resolved
to try an experiment i decided to cultivate my
will power believing that if i did this i would not
hesitate about making decisions-that when i had
an idea i would have sufficient confidence in
myself to put it  over -that i would not be
 afraid  of myself or of things or of others i
felt that if i could smash my ideas across i would
soon make my presence felt i knew that hereto-
fore i had always begged for success-had always
stood hat in hand depending on others to  give 
me the things i desired in short i was controlled
by the will of others henceforth i determined
to have a strong will of my own-to demand and
command what  wanted

  but how shall  begin what shall i do first
it was easy enough for me to determine to do
things-i had  determined  many times before
but this was a question of will power and i made
up my mind that the first step was to muster up
enough of my own will power to stick to and
carry out my determination

  with this new purpose in mind i applied my-
self to finding out something more about will
power i was sure that other men must have
studied the subject and the results of their ex-
perience would doubtless be of great value to me
in understanding the workings of my own will
so with a directness of purpose that i had
scarcely known before i began my search

  the results at first were discouraging while a
good deal had been written about the memory
and other faculties of the brain i could find
nothing that offered any help to me in acquiring
the new power that i had hoped might be pos-
sible

  but a little later in my investigation i en-
countered the works of prof frank charming
haddock to my amazement and delight i dis-
covered that this eminent scientist whose name
ranks with james bergson and royce had just

in answering this advertisement it is desirable that you mention aja-stout weekly
all-story weekly-advertising section

completed the most thorough and constructive
study of will power ever made i was astonished
to read his statement  the will is just as suscep-
tible of development as the muscles of the body
my question was answered eagerly i read fur-
ther-how dr haddock had devoted twenty
years to this study-how he had so completely
mastered it that he was actually able to set down
the very exercises by which anyone could develop
the will making it a bigger stronger force each
day simply through an easy progressive course
of training

  it is almost needless to say that i at once began
to practice the exercises formulated by dr had-
dock and i need not recount the extraordinary
results that i obtained almost froift the first day
i have already indicated the success that my
developed power of will has made for me

  but it may be thought that my case is excep-
tional let me again assure you that i am but an
average man with no super-developed powers
save that of my will and to further prove my
contention let me cite one or two instances i
have since come across which seem to show
conclusively that an indomitable will can be
developed by anyone

  one case that comes to my mind is that of a
young man who worked in a big factory he was
bright and willing but seemed to get nowhere
finally he took up the study of will training at
the suggestion of mr w m taylor the famous
efficiency expert of the willys-overland com-
pany and in less than a year his salary was
increased   then there is the case of
c d van vechten general agent of the north-
western life insurance company cedar rapids
iowa just a short time after receiving the
methods in will development suggested by prof
haddock he felt that they would be worth from
 to  to him

  another man mr h d ferguson residing in
hot springs ark increased his earnings from
 a week to  a week in a remarkably short
space of time after he began the study of will
training these are but a few-there are many
other equally amazing examples which i person-
ally know about and aside from the financial
gain this training has enabled thousands to over-
come drink and other vices almost overnight-
has helped overcome sickness and nervousness

has transformed unhappy envious discontented
people into dominating personalities filled with
the joy of living

  prof haddocks lessons rules and exercises in
will training have recently been compiled and
published in book form by the pelton publishing
co of meriden conn mr pelton has author-
ized me to say that any reader who cares to
examine the book may do so without sending any
money in advance in other words if after a
weeks reading you do not feel that this book is
worth  the sum asked return it and you will
owe nothing when you receive your copy for
examination i suggest that you first read the
articles on the law of great thinking how to
develop analytical power how to perfectly con-
centrate on any subject how to guard against
errors in thought how to drive from the mind
unwelcome thoughts how to develop fearless-
ness how to use the mind in sickness how to
acquire a dominating personality

  some few doubters will scoff at the idea of will
power being the fountainhead of wealth position
and everything we are striving for and some
may say that no mere book can teach the devel-
opment of the will but the great mass of
intelligent men and women will at least investi-
gate for themselves by sending for the book at
the publishers risk i am sure that any book
that has done for me-and for thousands of
others-what  power of will  has done-is well
worth investigating it is interesting to note that
among the  owners who have read used
and praised  power of will are such prominent
men as supreme court justice parker wu ting
fang ex-u s chinese ambassador lieut-gov
mckelvie of nebraska assistant postmaster-
general britt general manager christeson of
wells-fargo express co e st elmo lewis
governor arthur capper of kansas and thou-
sands of others

immediate action in this matter before you it
