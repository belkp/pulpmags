 canyons of the night

by robert dale denver

it was a tortured country racked by the plotting of greedy men and to
these canyons of the night a man and girl came each for a different reason
to find that their destinies lay in bringing light to this land together

began whistling a gay somewhat in-
tricate tune which her father the driv-
er had often played on what their
rancher neighbors called a fiddle-in
reality an expensive violin

 in the wagon dan carvel nodding
in time with the whistled music sud-
denly hauled back on the reins mak-
ing a sharp turn about a cliff shaped
like a boats prow the team had run

chapter i

enemy country

etween high blood-
rec canyn weills the
tral ran snakily cross-
anc recrossn a
noisy little creek
along the road two
chunky gray horses were pulling a cov-
ered studebaker wagon with a tarp
patched in variegated shades stretched
over its bows driving was a gray-
mustached pleasant-faced rancher puff-
ing contentedly on a pipe

  following the wagon came six loose
saddle horses hazed along by a pretty
dark-eyed girl sitting a blood-bay gel-
ding with a careless thistle-like grace
dressed in gray breeches woolen shirt
a flat-crowned sombrero she looked to
be a youngster of fifteen or sixteen but
jean carvel was past eighteen as the
wagon and the horses passed through
the sun and shadow of the canyon she
into half a dozen horsemen drawn up
in a line

  a battle line plainly for four of the
riders held rifles above their saddle
horns the group as soon as the wag-
on had stopped began to move on past
the gray team in the lead was a big
beefy-faced middle-aged man dressed
in dandified style-a cream-white wide-
brimmed hat red and black checkered
shirt black leather chaps with huge
silver conchas

  where you think youre headin
fellow this man addressed carvel
harshly

  i dont see any keep out signs
posted along this road said the driver
quietly my name is dan carvel im
here on legitimate business i ranch
over in the piedras country to the east
a year ago i bought five horses that
were raised in this night canyons
country a while ago they all headed
back for their home range i paid good
money for them and ive come to get
them if youve got no objections he
added with mild sarcasm

  we got plenty objections growled
the beefy rider im george threllen
manager of the cross seven ranch and
i never sold you any horses its a ten
to one bet if you bought any night can-
yons horses they were stolen from us
that bein the case you got no claim

to em turn your outfit and hightail
it out of here

the girls father eyed the six riders
and the mild look left his face to be




robert dale denver

replaced by one of stubborn determin-
ation that sounds like an order
threllen carvel stated and i dont
work for you or the cross seven fur-
thermore all this night river country
except the little used for ranch head-
quarters is government land-never has
been homesteaded its still public do-
main and as a citizen ive got the right
to travel over it on my business ive
got a bill of sale from the garys in
dawn canyon for those horses with
proper descriptions and brands and
those brands werent cross seven and
they had not been blotted after i find
my stray horses you can look them
over to see if youve got any claim or
title to them

  threllens big face turned redder his
almost colorless eyes began to glow
a bunch of thieves all the garys
he stormed the whole tribe of em
and their neighbors-thieves and worse
killers murderers im giving you one
last chance git outa here or else

  or else what inquired carvel un-
perturbed but his calm had just the
opposite of a quieting effect on threl-
len the riders big hand fell to the
six-shooter in his holster but as the
ugly snout of the gun came up jean
carvel spurred past the wagon to push
the blood-bay in between her father
and threllen at this threllens horse
shied starting his rider to swearing
and spurring then as the rowelling
made the horse sheep jump threllen
holstered his six-shooter to use both
hands to jerk the animals mouth sav-
agely

  sitting her blood bay meanwhile
jean carvel her dark eyes luminous
angrily surveyed the group of them
all of them in unconscious compli-
ment to the girls looks straightened
a little in their saddles one horse-
faced man black bearded as a biblical
character with greasy black hair curl-
ing from under a torn sombrero
grinned in a loose-lipped way and slyly
began edging his horse closer to the
girls she was talking to her father

  dad do what they say she urged

you have no chance against six armed
men turn the team around lets go
back

  dan carvel shook his head no
jean im going on the girls gray-
mustached father was one of those quiet
men whose anger can equal in intensity
the loud-mouthed rage represented by
threllens blustering sort i know ive
got no chance against them he ad-
mitted all ive got is a shotgun in
the wagon loaded with birdshot but
a man has a right to travel over govern-
ment land on his own business and
im not turning back they wont touch
you jean if they harm me you ride
back and notify the sheriff

  he spoke to the team and the wagon
rolled on through the riders for a
few yards it was allowed to proceed
then the cross seven manager threl-
len barked an order two men at once
spurred after the grays to lean down
and seize their bits again the outfit
halted threllen still yanking vicious-
ly on the bloodied mouth of his horse
came up on the off side of the wagon
opposite jean carvel

  shooting has been what we handed
people passing through here after we
warned em to keep out he snarled at
carvel but wed hate to shoot down
a father in front of his own girl so
well make it a quirtin for you-as a
special favor grab him some of you
and truss him up against that pine
maybe losing a little hide will teach
him we mean what we say yank him
down

  for a few moments under the blooa-
red cliff walls there was a struggle-
a desperate but hopeless one pushing
past jean carvel two men had dis-
mounted to climb over a wheel plan-
ning to drag her father from his seat
behind them the girl took down her
lariat intending to drop a loop over
the pair

  stop that she-cat hake yelled
threllen and the man with the curly
black beard came in to snatch away the
rope then dropping the lariat he
caught the girls wrists in his hands
canyons of the night



 meanwhile dan carvel had landed
one hard blow on the jaw of the lank
cowboy reaching for him promptly the
cowboy fell back over the wheel hit-
ting the ground hard two other cow-
boys however seized carvel and des-
pite his savage fighting brought him to
the ground here they tore off his shirt
and undershirt and a few moments
later dan carvels body bare above the
waist was plastered against the rough
reddish bark of a pine then his arms
were bent around the trunk and the
wrists lashed together with a length of
thong leather after that at a word
from threllen the lank cowboy that
carvel had hit in the jaw went to get
a quirt from his saddle

  jean carvel her wrists in the vise of
the big hands of the man threllen had
called hake tried vainly to break
loose while her blood-bay danced nerv-
ously hake chuckled and grasping
both her wrists in one big wide paw
he put the freed arm around the girl
drawing her slim body close to him

  you aint no she-cat youre just a
little pigeon thats what you are he
murmured cutest little pigeon i ever
laid eyes on

 dont you dare hit him jean
carvel screamed as she struggled fu-
riously to get loose the girl was be-
side herself with horror and anger
looking for some way to free herself
she glanced down at hakes knee cov-
ered only by a pair of levis bringing
up one leg agilely she jammed the spur
wheel against the mans leg

 a loud squall of pain came from
hake and his grip on the girls hands
slackened jean jerked them loose and
reached for hakes six-shooter riding
in a holster at his waist the big hog-
leg came out of leather but threllen
was coming in on her left crashing his
horse deliberately into the girls blood-
bay jean clung desperately to the six-
shooter but before she could use the
weapon threllen had clamped her arms
to her sides next instant he twisted
the gun roughly from her hand

  the weapon fell to the ground and

with it went the girls slim chance of
helping her father hake had captured
her wrists again and was twisting them
cruelly jean began crying not because
of the pain but in pity for her father

 let him have it quinn yelled
threllen to the man with the quirt
and we ought to give his wild-cat
daughter a dose of the same medicine

  the man lifted the quirt high over
dan carvels bare back but before the
blow could fall a clatter of hoofs
sounded and another rider came out of
the trees down canyon a young wom-
an riding side saddle and dressed in
an impractical garb for range country
-a long green riding habit topped by
a sombrero as a concession doubtless to
the strong southwestern sun she was
blonde tall slender-too slender for
vigorous health the face too thin for
beauty her eyes a deep blue in color
were dull dead with a definite look of
haunting melancholy she rode straight
to the tree to which dan carvel was
bound

 i asked you to wait down canyon
for us miss linda said threllen

  what are you doing here the girl
returned what has this man done
threllen who is he

  you can see for yourself what were
doin threllen told her sullenly we
never saw him before him and his
daughter say they want to hunt some
stray horses they claim they bought
from the garys most likely horses the
garys stole from us if there was any
horses like he claims its my idea hes
a gary spy we cant allow no stranger
in here on our range you know that
mr temple has given orders to stop
anyone coming in on the ranch

  if this man had intended any harm
the girl pointed out he wouldnt risk
bringing in his own daughter since
theres no other wagon road to dawn
canyon hes entitled to travel through
our range to the gary ranch to get back
his horses give him a reasonable time
to find them and take them out i dont
understand why you have to count
everyone as our enemies you and tem-


robert dale denver

pie take it for granted that anyone
coming into this country comes to do
us harm

  and we got a right to take that for
granted burst out threllen we
didnt start whats been started in here
one of the garys and a neighbor killed
your father didnt they and theyve
killed five of our cross seven men
havent they its us against the garys
and the rest of those ranchers in dawn
and star canyons theyve been steal-
in our horses and now that theyve
started shootin us down we got to
fight back im having this man
whipped so him and other men will
learn to keep off our range his voice
had an almost fanatical earnestness

  i say to turn him loose said the
girl sharply lashing a man for just
crossing our range is beastly and in-
human turn him loose

  threllen evidently was having trou-
ble in reaching a decision a powerful
man physically with a huge store of
vitality he plainly was a slow thinker
the other men patiently waited for his
orders except for the black-bearded
man hake they appeared to take little
interest in the affair it was just an-
other job to them

  having to make up his mind seemed
to enrage threllen almost to the point
of bursting his dark-colored face
turned purple he muttered to him-
self then all right turn him loose
he ordered finally but listen to me
you he snarled at carvels back you
can go on to the garys the road to
dawn canyon turns up a side canyon
to the right up there a ways well
give you three days to get back through
here and well look over any horses
you take out turn the girl loose
hake

  freed carvel silently replaced his
torn clothing then he addressed
threllen if you had had me
whipped he declared id have killed
you some time for it he would have
said more but jean carvel dismounted
to lay a hand on her fathers arm to
urge him toward the wagon

  and dont you turn a foot off that
road to dawn canyon said threllen
as a final word dont hunt for horses
on this range if you brought em from
the garys they wouldnt of come back
here

  that turnin off dont apply to you
little pigeon the black-bearded hake
told jean carvel his little pig-like eyes
gleaming you can turn off any time
you want to just so you turn my way

  at this carvel swung angrily on
hake but the girl on the black horse
spoke up hake she remarked in a
voice that was suddenly like a whip-
lash keep a decent tongue in your
head

  the carvel wagon creaked on again
with the loose horses trailing after it
jean carvel rode over close to the girl
in the riding habit thank god you
stopped them she said in a low voice
ill never forget that never

  the rider of the black horse was at
least three or four years older than
jean she looked at jean gravely now
as at a child and then she smiled sad-
ly im only sorry it happened she
said adios

  as the outfit went on with the wag-
on wheels jolting hard over stones the
girl on the black horse looked after the
slim graceful figure of jean carvel in
her blue eyes with the tragic cast was
plain envy silently the whole group of
cross seven riders watched until wag-
on and horses were out of sight lafe
hake with his loose-lipped smile keep-
ing his small eyes fixed on the girl on
the blood-bay

  then threllen frowned at the sun
which was low enough to send a path
of rays over the pines making a comb
along the ridge gettin late he mut-
tered

  yes agreed the woman on the
black i wish i could trade places
with that girl threllen she seems
really happy without a worry shes
of the sun while all of us that live here
in these night river canyons are of
the shadow and there is nothing
ahead for us but shadows
canyons of the night



  threllen looked somberly at his
horses ears well have the shadows
cleared up fore long miss linda he
said gravely and then well have
plenty sun-all the sun there is for
ourselves were due for a big ruckus
but when its ended well have those
garys wiped out and well have all the
canyons of the night to ourselves he
spoke with the heavy conviction of a
person who had few ideas but had
those few firmly fixed

  the woman shivered lets go
back she said abruptly and the group
went along the canyon at a jog trot
two men riding a hundred yards in
front threllen with miss linda and
three men in the back as they rode
the men kept rifles over their saddle
horns ready for instant use

chapter ii

night ambush

ldish andy partle
who was roane bran-
dons partner on a
small cattle ranch
was frequently heard
to declare that his
young partner had
been born a few dec-
ades too late roane
andy maintained should have lived in
the days when he could have trapped
the rockies in the company of kit car-
son jim bridger and their kind roane
liked hunting and catching wild mus-
tangs more than he did ranching the
business of ranching often bored him
and at such times he would load a pack
horse whistle to a half-dozen hounds
and ride back into isolated country to
hunt and trap a few weeks or months
later looking as wild as a wolf he
would reappear ready for another stint
of ranch work

  two inches over six feet loose
rangy with a deep good-humored
voice roane brandon in a buckskin
quill-ornamented jacket made a strik-
ing figure lounging now against the bar

of the coulter saloon in the town of
hurley after a trip of a hundred miles
from their home he and andy partle
a gray-mustached man of sixty had
ridden into hurley that morning with
two pack horses having made camp on
the outskirts of the place and hobbled
their horses they had spent the hours
since loafing about the town

  standing with them now in the coul-
ter bar and gambling place was fred
temple president of the big cross
seven ranch company temple was a
transplanted easterner a city man
dressed in a business suit with english
riding boots a long-headed reddish-
blond man of forty-five who would have
looked entirely in place at a bank direc-
tors meeting andy and roane had
practically forced their company on the
rancher temple being the snobbish
sort who did not readily pick up ac-
quaintance with strangers andy and
roane were drinking beer sparingly
temple was drinking scotch-a lot of
it-and warming up a little under its
influence

  the two had been lucky in having
found temple in town that day but
that was as far as their luck went they
had come to the hurley country to
make a deal with temple for cross
seven horses but temple had declared
curtly that he had no horses for sale

  the cross seven is not selling
horses i tell you snapped temple
when andy partle brought up the mat-
ter for the third time they would
need gathering and we havent time to
do that just now we have more impor-
tant matters to attend to

  well do the gathering offered
partle and wed pay mighty good
money for a hundred head or so that
we got a chance to turn a profit on
well give you a hundred a piece for
three- to five-year-old mares and gel-
dings thats mighty good money

  good money admitted temple
startled and you can make money
paying that much for unbroken
horses

  yeah stated roane brandon


robert dale denver

these night canyon horses are some
of the best in the west and theyve got
looks besides we know a bunch of
easterners that will pay big money for
horses to stock the ranch they just
bought well pay you a thousand dol-
lars down now as earnest money the
rest when we tally out the hundred
head

  for the first time temple considered
the deal the ranch could use that
money he said those horses do us
no good out there just running on the
range you say you can gather them
yourself theyre hard to corral in
those canyons

  i know that country mr temple
said andy partle like i told you i
rode for the cross seven some years
ago thats our offer-a hundred a piece
for a hundred head totaling ten thou-
sand dollars

  partle and brandon glancing at tem-
ple knew that the man was seriously
turning over their offer there was a
money look in his light blue eyes

 youve got the thousand dollars
earnest money in cash he asked

  andy partle promptly pulled out a
roll of bills but another man had
strolled up to the bar stepping in be-
tween temple and the other two partle
recognized the proprietor of the saloon
and gambling place gid coulter andy
had noticed him before standing talk-
ing to a customer doing some solitary
heavy drinking at a nearby table the
customer seemed vaguely familiar to
andy but he had not been able to place
him

  hello coulter said andy still
doing business at the old stand i see
many a dollar of hard-earned wages i
lost in here a long time ago when i
worked for the cross seven

 nobody asked you to lose your
money in here coulter rasped the
saloon man was tall and raw-boned
with a battered hook-nosed face
seems to me i heard you talking about
selling some horses temple probably
i heard wrong

  its mighty easy money coulter

said temple ten thousand dollars for
a hundred head-thats the offer we
got so many horses out there running
wild that theyre eating the range
poor

  i wouldnt sell no horses now tem-
ple growled coulter not with these
other things to attend to step back in
the office and well talk it over
coulters voice was uncompromising
and harsh it was the wrong tone to
use on temple who had had too many
drinks of scotch

  whats there to talk over he re-
turned arrogantly im president of
the cross seven and capable i trust
of running its affairs we need money
whats a better way to get it than to
sell horses ill take your offer he
told andy partle and roane brandon
hand over that money and ill give
you a receipt

  it would be businesslike i guess to
have a sales agreement besides a re-
ceipt said roane brandon and taking
a pencil and sheet of paper from a pock-
et he began writing on the bar top

 now look here temple put in
coulter i say well talk this over first
youre drunk and dont know what
youre doing

  temple who was a plain snob when
sober and worse when drunk turned on
the saloon man my dear coulter he
said sarcastically will you kindly con-
cern yourself with your own business
all right growled coulter abrupt-
ly and his greenish eyes held a glare
that boded no good for temple have
it your own way he retreated to his
office staying there while the deal for
the horses was completed the sales
agreement signed and the thousand dol-
lars paid over

  during that interval the hard-drink-
ing customer at the table had gotten up
to stroll into coulters private office
closing the door behind him

 temple tucked the money in his
pocket and promptly left the saloon
brandon and partle were about to fol-
low when gid coulter emerged from
his office and strode toward them
canyons of the night



 you men probably think youve
made a good deal he remarked try-
ing hard to appear friendly but
theres a war on in those canyons of
the night youll get shot if you go in
-by one side or the other the garys
and the mcwhirters and the neils got
two of the seven canyons on the east
side of the river and the cross seven
has the other five they been fightin
to see who gets them all the prin-
cipal owner of the cross seven addi-

roane brandon

son stevens was killed in a gun battle
not long ago this city dude temple
whos running the ranch has no more
business managin a horse ranch than i
got ramroddin a sunday-school if i
were you id keep out of that fight
temple and his punchers cant protect
you from the garys and their neigh-
bors

  the garys used to be decent folks
when i worked here before remarked
andy tough now are they
tough you bet theyre tough i
wouldnt ride through those canyons
now for all the horses in the west
five of the cross seven men been
killed besides addison stevens

  you take a lot of interest in our
health said roane coolly id like to
ask why

  coulter stared at brandon hard you
could ask he rasped out and id tell

you that its none of your damned busi-
ness except that it happens i dont
want you or anybody else in that coun-
try is that plain

  the saloon man had raised his voice
suddenly so that his words could be
heard over the entire room roane and
partle quickly glanced about them the
gambling establishment in the coulter
saloon occupied over half of the big
room a half-dozen dealers were on
duty lounging about their tables and
layouts since the saloon was practically
empty these dealers partle and bran-
don noticed were suddenly alert all
were armed with six-shooters the faro
lookout was holding an ugly-looking
shotgun over his knees roane realized
this coulter saloon and gambling place
could be a tough place he himself was
not armed he never went armed into
a town he went armed in wildernesses
where he might run into a grizzly on
the rampage

  andy partle wore an old bisley mod-
el six-shooter stuck behind his belt
andy moved now so that he faced both
the dealers and coulter with his hand
just above the handmade cedar handles
of the gun i wouldnt start anything
coulter said andy im old but i
can still plug a dollar in the belly at
thirty paces my friends got no gun
but he dont need one that youngun
without a shootin iron is more danger-
ous than you are with one coulter
with his bare hands he could tear you
apart you and any two men you got in
here and what he cant tear apart ill
shore shoot apart

  for a moment coulter stared at andy
partles bisley then he looked at roane
brandon in his garb that was reminis-
cent of the old fur trapper days mean-
while the dealers in the place looked at
their employer for some signal abrupt-
ly coulter shrugged his shoulders

  if you want to go in and buy horses
off the cross seven all right he stat-
ed its no funeral of mine turn-
ing he strolled back into his office

  coulter had backed down but when
partle and brandon left they kept a

wary eye on the coulter dealers out-
side the pair looked at the little town
built on a slope of the monster canyon
cut by the night river upstream in
an enormous bend of the river were the
seven so-called canyons of the night
dusk in which the cross seven head-
quarters lay and four sister canyons
comprising the cross seven range-
dark twilight moon and midnight
closer explained andy partle were
the two canyons dawn and star in
which were the ranches of the garys
the neils and the mcwhirters

  nothin to keep us from travelin
into them canyons now-ceptin our
good sense remarked andy and the
two headed for their camp

  a big flop-eared hound came out to
greet roane leaping up on him and giv-
ing one deep bark roane patted the
black and tan hide of the animal called
savvy because he was a smart dog with
lots of savvy

  bringing in their hobbled horses
they packed up and prepared to travel
although the sun was already swinging
low over the rims

  i dont like this trip andy partle
grumbled as he tightened a pack saddle
cinch that gambler wasnt tellin us
no fairy story about how dangerous it
is down there with a war on between
the cross seven outfit and their neigh-
bors in dawn and star canyons theys
alius a lot o tough cowboys ridin them
canyons nobody would ever work that
rough country ceptin outlaws on the
dodge

  is that why you took a job there
asked roane slyly

  yes it was the other man admitted
frankly i had to go on the dodge for
a few years until the trouble i was in
cleared up best horses i ever seen
down there but them canyons is just
good places for funerals a thousand
feet straight down in some places
them canyons had me spooked then
and they still got me spooked im tell-
in you i got a feelin well never get
back out of there

 roane brandon chuckled you

ought to get yourself a gypsy outfit and
tell fortunes for a dollar a throw bet-
ter buy yourself a quart of liquid cour-
age before you leave town

  itd take a barl to help me andy
said whimsically as he slapped the sad-
dle on his horse the kind o shivers
i got now would take moren whiskey
to warm up nossir i didnt like this
from the time that nab woman sent me
a thousand dollars cash to hand fred
temple as down money in a deal to buy
horses i couldnt see no sense to hand-
in out a thousand dollars for nothin
what was to keep me from just waltz-
in in i thought

  but that woman was right she
wrote that any other way it wouldnt be
safe strangers found in them night
canyons are shot on sight with gun-
hands jist hired to exterminate garys
and neils i caint believe it-when i
worked on the ranch addison stevens
was plumb friendly with the garys but
hes dead now and this here temple is
in charge a different breed

  andys jaw suddenly fell and he
stopped his work now i know that
fattish feller that sat at the table he
exclaimed hamlin stevens addisons
half-brother he used to be a slim sort
owned some stock in the ranch and
used to come there to live and hunt in
between traveling to europe and back
drinkinest feller i ever heard of two
quarts a day was nothin to him when
he was goin good but he was quiet
on his drunks-not no hell raiser
not like you then remarked roane
jokingly come on get that horse
loaded you can chatter later

  they set out jogging along with
jouncing pack boxes and with the
hound savvy sniffing at trails but fol-
lowing none knowing this was not a
day to hunt but after the hound had
scared two young grouse whirring into
a pine roane shot them grouse would
make a good supper

  reaching the rim of a deep canyon
andy halted moon canyon he said
next one to it is dusk where the
cross seven headquarters is located
canyons of the night



might as well camp here its gittin
late i used to stop here often years
ago when i was ridin for the cross
seven

  roane hobbled their horses while
andy cooked supper the return to the
country where he had ridden years be-
fore had put the oldish partle in a sen-
timental and reminiscent mood

  its sorta like one of these romances
you read about in books confessed
andy as they ate this here margaret
mcnab woman-we called her nab-
she looks rough as an alligator but un-
derneath shes got a soft heart and a
big one she was on the ranch as nurse
to that motherless little girl linda ste-
vens when i was ridin there that
little girl couldnt a had a better moth-
er that nab was a mighty fine nurse
too-she saved my life one time i had
pneumonia thats when i fell for her
-hard

  why didnt you marry her de-
manded roane

  id of done it in a second the only
reason why i didnt is nab wouldnt
have me then said she was going to
stick to this little girl linda stevens
-that linda bein without a mother
needed her moren i did so when i
left the ranch i told her nab if you
ever need a wuthless roughneck to per-
form some triflin service let me know
and she promised me she would but
i never heard nothing more all these
years until i got that letter from her

  she said the stevens girl had been
sent back east to school a few years
back and nab had gone to the coast to
nurse in some hospital now she was
back on the ranch again sort of as com-
panion for linda stevens who was all
grown up she said that lindas pa had
been killed in a gunfight and if i was
still willin to give that help i offered
once to let her know but that it might
mean a risk to my life so i wrote her
back id come and thats when she sent
the thousand cash so i cd get on the
cross seven disguised as a horse buyer
thats all right but i hadnt no call to
get you into it

  you didnt get me into it dis-
agreed roane i begged for the chance
to come along and anyway i owe you
something i havent forgotten how
you took me in after dad died

  andy spat tobacco juice you dont
owe me nothin for that you could of
raised yourself from the time you was
a five-year-old weaner livin by hunt-
in and trappin nobody had to take
you in

jean carvel

  all right said roane good-humor-
edly theres no debt on either side
and i just came along for a chance to
look at these night river horses and
see some new country and to see this
nab lady fall into your arms

  savvy busy with part of a grouse
carcass suddenly began a low growling
andy scolded the hound

  let him growl said roane sav-
vys hearing something and warning us
against it and by his growl its no
coyote smelling our grub its some-
thing more serious savvy smells a
man

   cordin to you that hound kin
talk andy hoorawed his partner
that brutell get you into trouble
some day hell tackle a bear and then
run back to git behind you for pro-
tection

  not savvy returned roane im
going to douse the fire and when i do


robert dale denver

you jump back into the brush and
dont waste any time jumpin thats
a man savvys smellin back there

  leaning forward he swiftly spilled
a canvas bucket of water over the small
flame as steam and smoke arose he
and andy leaped back into the dark-
ness seconds later came the crash of
a rifle sounding from the direction of
a rocky point behind camp a second
shot came a moment later roane grab-
bing a rifle from his bedroll shouted
to savvy go git him boy when
the hound with a deep bark streaked
toward the little rocky hill roane was
close at the dogs heels

  there were no other shots but as the
hounds voice lifted again in a booming
bark up ahead came the quick drum of
horse hoofs and the crash of a horse
through the brush savvy pursued hot-
ly as the fleeing rider kept to the dense
cover of pinion and cedar racing away
from the camp roane realized the man
would put a bullet into the hound if
savvy got too close and taking a whis-
tle from a pocket he sent a shrill blast
to recall the dog from his hopeless
chase

  before he returned to camp roane
found the boot tracks of the ambusher
not many yards from the camp using
several matches he photographed their
shape in his mind and took measure-
ments with a piece of string

  andy had built up the fire again and
was stomping about angrily when
roane returned the blasted killer
he growled all set to take a potshot
at us likely sneakin up to git close
range shots at us when you put out that
fire lucky that hound smelled him
out

  yeah agreed roane searching
about in his bedroll and bringing out a
pair of indian moccasins which he be-
gan exchanging for his high-heeled rid-
ing boots that bird came from the
direction of hurley he was sent out
likely by someone there id mention
your old friend coulter if it wouldnt
hurt your feelings

  id like to hurt coulter with a hot

sixgun slug grunted andy if twas
him that sent that buzzard after us
you sure aint goin chasin a feller at
night in this country afoot he pro-
tested watching roane put on the moc-
casins its goin to storm and in the
dark theres cliffs where if you fell off
youd land about in time for breakfast
-only itd be some buzzards break-
fast not yours

  roane swiftly laced the moccasins
i got a pair of night eyes and ill take
savvy along on a leash to uide me
ive got to go afoot if i rode a horse
that fellow would hear me coming a
mile away

  goin afoot after a man on a horse
exclaimed andy and then abruptly shut
up he knew that roane was a buck-
aroo who had ridden bad outlaw horses
and as a mountain cowboy had roped
bulls on treacherous slopes andy also
knew that in hunting roane and his
pack of hounds had run innumerable
bear and lion in country too rough to
ride a horse over and had done it for
hours at a stretch roane could travel
all day at a trot most lion and bear
hunters can they usually have to in
following their hounds on a hot trail

  standing by the campfire in his buck-
skin jacket roane looked like an in-
dian except that his features were too
square and his eyes were blue he put
a knife in a scabbard at his waist
wrapped a little bread jerky and coffee
into a package and dropped a dozen
rifle cartridges into a pocket i feel
like taking a little run he remarked
if i dont come back tonight you
move the outfit on tomorrow to the
cross seven headquarters ill join you
there

  if savvy was a little bigger you
could put a saddle on his back and ride
him said andy but i hate to see
you go roane its risky following a
bushwhacker like that in rough coun-
try he may lay for you or he may
travel fifty miles fore he stops

  roane shrugged and picked up the
carbine i wont kick at going fifty
miles after that hombre i aim to find
canyons of the night



out who would sneak up on us to am-
bush us want to ask him why he did
it

  better put a bullet in him first and
ask him later cautioned andy partle
they play marbles for keeps in this
night river country and they use lead
slugs for marbles

chapter iii

two good samaritans

avvy had no trouble in
picking up the trail of the
horse of the would-be dry
gulcher the rider had head-
ed down into moon canyon
on the trail roane and andy
had followed from town savvy trot-
ted down it sniffing occasionally tug-
ging on his leash but not very hard
whining a little in a bored way savvy
wasnt too keen to be on this trail
there was nothing exciting about fol-
lowing a tame horse it was just a job
chasing a rabbit would have been more
fun and sport

  the canyon bottom was wide fairly
level and clear of trees off under the
peaks a storm was brewing but here the
moon was out to show a wagon road
the rider was following this road and
after him trotted savvy mile after mile
with roane jogging along tirelessly in
his moccasins

  out of this canyon the road angled
finally to climb through a long pass in
a ridge then crossing a wide mesa it
dropped into another canyon from
andys description roane knew that
this would be dusk canyon in which
lay the cross seven headquarters

  he rested a minute or so listening to
the night noise of the wind through the
pines on the slopes lulled by it as if by
music from a great organ then again
man and dog went on the road forked
one branch climbing into a side can-
yon the horse tracks were plain in the
moonlight turning up the side canyon
roane turned with them several times
he thought he could catch the sound of

a horses steel shoes up ahead it did
not surprise roane that he should be
overtaking the horseman ordinarily
men did not ride fast at night in can-
yon country-a jog at best-and roane
had trotted almost steadily since he had
left andy he increased his pace a lit-
tle clouds were beginning to drift
across the moon and stars and the road
angled back and forth along a dark
wooded slope

  roane was a hundred yards or more
from what he judged was the canyon
rim when he heard the crash of a gun
a six-shooter above him two or three
seconds and there was another shot
then a third roane halted listening
hard whoever was doing the shooting
was certainly not firing at him after
a little period of silence came the sound
of a horse running away tearing
through brush with a clatter of flop-
ping empty stirrups plainly the horse
was riderless

  savvy growled but roane silenced
him another horse was in motion now
going across the mesa with the regular
hoofbeats of a lope roane began climb-
ing again following the road at a trot
with savvy padding ahead of him the
moon was blanketed by clouds a few
stars gave a little light

  the most plausible explanation for
the shots was that the man he and
savvy had been trailing had met an-
other rider and there had been a short
fight between the two one man had
been knocked from his saddle and his
horse had run off without him the
other not waiting to make sure wheth-
er he had killed his man or not had
loped away

  on the rim roane hesitated for a
moment from the thick darkness of a
clump of cedars and pinions came the
sound of a human voice raised in what
seemed a faint call for help he moved
toward it warily for as andy had said
this was dangerous country savvy
growled a little he stopped to tie the
dog to a tree

  after that he catfooted along car-
bine in his hand moccasins pressing


robert dale denver

down softly until he was certain there
were no sticks to crack under them
there was no further call but he heard
several groans someone had been shot
but an injured man if still alive can be
as dangerous to someone wanting to
help him as to an enemy

 pushing aside a growth of small
pines roane looked out on a little open
space the light was just sufficient to
show the dark blot of a man lying on
his back roane moved in quietly to
kneel by the fellows side first making
sure that the fellow had no gun the
wounded mans hands were empty and
drawn up under his right shoulder

  roane struck a match cupped it the
man was a long sandy-haired cowboy
somewhere in his early twenties his
eyes were closed another match in a
swift examination showed that his pair
of high-heeled boots were much small-
er than those worn by the man who had
ambushed roane and andy this cow-
boy was a victim of that ambusher
which warmed roane to him at once

  building a little fire out of dry twigs
he took away the clenched hands and
found blood soaking the flannel shirt
just below the shoulder cutting away
part of the shirt revealed a hole made
by a bullet which had smashed through
the mans right side high up leaving
a gaping wound from which blood
flowed freely to staunch the flow
roane divided his neckerchief to make
two wads fastening them with strips
of cloth torn from the mans shirt
hearing the murmur of a creek not far
away he brought a hat full of water to
pour some down the throat of the man
who had begun to whisper faintly
water-still without opening his
eyes

 there was not much help roane
could give a doctor was needed here

 they were roane knew somewhere
on the big mesa above the cross seven
headquarters in dusk canyon he
could go down the trail and along the
canyon bottom until he came to the
ranch but that would be a long time to
leave the young fellow maybe too long

 in cutting away the blood-soaked
shirt hed heard paper crinkle in a
pocket examining the paper now he
found it was a letter addressed to one
tom gary if this were one of the
garys deadly enemies of the cross
seven that did away with his idea of
going to the cross seven for help
there would be no help there for a
gary

  looking about him he suddenly saw
a faint glimmer of light through the
pines to the north climbing a little
hill he could see the mounting flames
of a fire a fire started recently since
he had not seen it before it offered a
prospect of help and he started off on
a trot

  near the campfire which was burning
low by the time he came near it he
saw the gray tarp of a covered wagon
he raised a hail it was not answered
but as he went close to the wagon a
voice sounded from behind him-a fem-
inine voice

  drop that rifle the voice ordered
him firmly then put up your hands
and march toward that fire and dont
try any tricks

 yes maam no maam he said
meekly and letting his carbine fall
went along with his hands up he
grinned a little he liked that voice
despite the attempt of its owner to
make it sound very harsh and forceful

  reaching the fire he calmly used a
moccasined foot to kick up the fire
then turned to look at his captor she
was a girl of sixteen at most he judged
garbed in a blue skirt leather jacket
high-heeled boots her hair brown with
luminous lights caught from the fire
was fluffed above a dark-eyed face that
was the prettiest roane had ever seen
a mighty cute kid despite the double-
barreled shotgun she held in a business-
like manner

  sorry to disturb you miss he said
but i ran onto a man whos been shot
and is in a bad way hes lying close
to the place where this road drops
through the rimrock id like to bring
him here to be taken care of laying
canyons of the night



out in the open he wont have much
chance to pull through

  i heard the shots said the girl
thats why i built up the fire i was
figuring to go over and investigate
but you found him you say is he-
she hesitated im worried about my
father he rode off today and hasnt
come back yet that isnt the direction
he went but- her voice broke off

  it cant be your father roane as-
sured her hastily a young fellow
one of the garys at any rate he car-
ried a letter in his pocket addressed to
tom gary im a stranger in this coun-
try but the man that shot him im
positive is the same hombre that fired
at my partner and me in our camp above
moon canyon to-
night

 the shotgun
lowered a little
then only to be
brought sharply
up again how
do i know youre
telling the truth
she demanded

 why would i
tell you anything
else he returned
simply theonly
way i can prove
it is to show you
that young fel-
low right now youll just have to take
my word that im not a liar

  i know youre not lying said the
girl quickly and as if to show she was
ashamed of having doubted him she at
once leaned the gun against a wagon
wheel can you bring him here on a
horse

  only way to get him here i guess
although i hate to run the risk of all
that jolting if there was another man
we could carry him on a stretcher are
you alone here

  she nodded yes were strangers
in here too we were traveling to see
the garys about some horses that
strayed back to this country and we
came to a stretch of road that we

couldnt get the wagon across dad
said hed ride on alone and leave me in
camp hed have taken me along but
its dangerous riding through this coun-
try and he intended to be gone only a
day but why dont we make a stretcher
for this man i can carry my end of it
roane looked at her wiry body i
guess you could he admitted this
young gary is tall but not so heavy
ill cut a couple of poles if youll get
a piece of tarp

  by the fire they worked fastening a
strip of stout canvas to two tough poles
roane had cut then with roane car-
rying the makeshift stretcher and a can-
teen of water they started out walking
fast over the rough ground

 he had left
savvy tied near
the wounded man
and the hound
gave a deep bark
as they came
near surprising-
ly roane found
young gary con-
scious and even
able to talk a lit-
tle he stared up
at roane and
asked who are
you

  someone thats
willing to help
you mister my name is roane bran-
don i ranch over in the cradle river
country and this girls father rode to
see you garys about some stray horses
he hasnt come back yet maybe you
met him he bought some horses from
some of your family some time ago
his name is dan carvel put in the
girl you havent seen him

  no said the wounded man but
i left the ranch early today your
horses came back my brother ed said
they were the ones hed sold

  roane held the canteen to garys
lips and gary swallowed a little

  you know what man you met up
here asked roane the fellow that
shot you

in the second march number

 grayhorse

            range empire

robert dale denver

  gary hesitated a moment then shook
his head

  wouldnt tell us i reckon if you
did said roane want to look after
your own wolf skinning well have to
get a doctor for you nearest one i
suppose is in hurley

 no none there my uncle will
gary is a doctor the best in night
river country lives over on a ranch
near dads in dawn canyon ill be
able to ride back in a couple hours if
i can get a horse i wish youd get
word to-to- another gusty sigh
came then weak from the strain of
talking he fainted the blood flow
from the wound had dwindled but
plainly a ride even a short one would
start it again

  they placed gary on the stretcher
and started out walking slowly so as
to jar him as little as possible thun-
der was rumbling from a cloud bank
to the northwest roane led the way
enabled by his freakish eyes to avoid
brush and boulders despite the dark-
ness made by the approaching storm
the girl tired but she was game re-
fusing to stop longer than a few sec-
onds to rest

  reaching the camp they placed gary
in a comfortable bed jean carvel made
in the wagon for him there roane
undressed the man meanwhile the girl
had prepared bandages and together
they washed the dirt from about the
ugly wound as best they could without
disturbing the blood clots the bleed-
ing had practically stopped but a high
fever had begun to burn the mans body
in delirium he began to mumble a few
words jean carvel glanced up at roane
in astonishment

  why hes saying the name of that
girl from the cross seven the one who
saved dad from being quirted by those
brutes yesterday linda stevens he
wants word gotten to her but i
thought the stevens and gary families
are enemies

  they are said roane i heard in
town that addison stevens was found
with a gary and a neighbor all dead

of bullets this cowboy may be a
friend of the stevens girl but ive got
a hunch he has to be kept hidden from
the cross seven bunch that his life
wont be worth much if they find him
we could take him on in the wag-
on toward the garys if the road wasnt
washed out

  but you wouldnt be here if it hadnt
been washed out i dont know what to
do with him its going to rain which
will wipe out our tracks carrying him
over here but i doubt if its safe to
leave him in the wagon likely a cross
seven rider shot him and that fellow
may ride up here in the morning to see
what happened to the man he potted
she nodded agreement the wagon
is off the road but it can be easily seen
and if anybody comes into camp they
could hear gary moaning but what
can we do

  i can borrow a horse from you to
ride for his doctor uncle to attend to
him maybe hell say its safe to move
him home meanwhile he can be hid-
den in that rocky ridge back of here
with a shelter rigged up against the
rain but i dont like to leave you here
alone in this ornery country you bet-
ter ride with me to the garys your
dad is likely there by now

 go away and leave gary by him-
self jean carvel shook her head i
couldnt do that and dad might come
back here and find me gone not that
i wouldnt like to be out of here ive
been scared ever since i came down into
these deep canyons and ill stay scared
until we get out if dad doesnt come
back and he isnt at the garys ill have
to hunt for him tomorrow

  a few drops of rain hissed into the
fire roane looked at his watch it was
still an hour before midnight by
morning enough rain would have fal-
len to cover the tracks they had made
carrying gary to camp

  taking a lantern and axe he set off
into the low rocky ridge a hundred
yards away he found a semi-cave made
by a huge boulder that had fallen
against a cliff no horseman could
canyons of the night



reach the spot without dismounting no
man afoot could see it without a close
search a few poles and a tarpaulin
would make a snug shelter against wind
and rain after he had the shelter pre-
pared he brought up dan carvels bed-
roll and a jug of water placing the
blankets on a bed made of pine needles
he stretched the tarp for a door

  after that he and jean carvel put
gary on a stretcher again and trans-
ferred him to the shelter she was to
stay with the wounded man during the
night she could as roane pointed out
go to and from the wagon along a rocky
path without leaving tracks-although
the rain now slogging down steadily
would take care of that

  back in the camp roane saddled one
of the camp horses lengthening the
stirrups on jeans saddle the wagon
road leading to the gary ranches in
dawn canyon would be difficult to fol-
low in the rain but he was used to
traveling strange country at night

  i think tom gary is in love with
linda stevens jean said as they
drank coffee from a fresh pot she had
prepared he keeps saying her name
if it came to the worst shed help him
maybe shes not in love with him
said roane and she might turn him
over to her relatives instead

  no said jean carvel firmly shes
not that kind i saw her she seemed
to be so unhappy herself that shed hate
to make anyone else unhappy shes
sick-i dont mean with a disease just
sick inside unhappy and i think that
shes unhappy because she and this
gary are in love and their families are
fighting

  roane grinned just like a girl to
think that he remarked youve been
reading a lot of romances no use to
fill your mind with that stuff now time
for that later

 yes she scoffed how old do
you think i am anyway

 he looked at her suddenly and
frowned older i guesg-tftan i thought
at first he admitted but i dont
imagine youre ufarried are you

 no she said and chuckled of
course not not for a long time yet
fine he said and laughed also
im in no hurry to get married my-
self always figured thirty would be
about the right age for me if i could
find a girl to have me by then maybe
youd consider waiting that long

  i thought id wait until i was at
least thirty-five she told him

  better yet he said approvingly
that would let me put off marrying
until im about forty its a deal when
youre thirty-five ill be waiting then
he sobered abruptly i hate to leave
you here you wont get scared ill
be back as soon as i can id leave my
dog savvy but if anyone saw him here
it would be a dead give-away that id
been in your camp i think ill send
him back to my partner with a note for
him to move on to the cross seven
that i wont be back ive trained savvy
to go back to the last camp

  a smart dog takes after his own-
er no doubt jean added slyly ill
get you some paper to write that note
on and some oil cloth to wrap it in so
it will stay dry

  drinking his coffee roane brandon
looked with appreciative eyes at the
girl as she climbed briskly into the
wagon a lot of chance any man would
have to marry that girl if he waited he
reflected shed have dozens of chances
to marry the only way to get her
would be to sweep her off her feet and
rush her to a preacher quick

chapter iv

death at the wagon

he storm as it moved
over the canyons brought
with it frequent flashes of
lightning aided by them
roane traveled steadily
along the road to the
across a rolling pine-
covered mesa to drop into another of
the seven sister canyons of the night
river climbing out of this the road


robert dale denver

wound along a narrow ridge where the
cliffs fell almost sheer on one side to
descend into a deep gorge that he
judged belonged to dawn canyon
home of the garys and neighbor ranch-
ers andy had mentioned a narrow
precipitous-walled rock gorge called
gary gorge

  by then the storm had rumbled away
leaving wispy clouds which allowed
enough light for travel at a lope the
clattering of the horse raising an up-
roar that filled the canyon

  ahead finally he saw the first sign of
habitation a light closer he could
make out the dim outlines of building
and corrals huddled on a bench a little
back from the steep-walled trench
through which he rode this must be
a ranch of one of the gary families and
if the garys were as quick to shoot as
the cross seven riders it might be a
ticklish matter to ride up to the place

  roane found however that riding up
to the ranch was not simple he was
halted suddenly by an obstruction a
ten-foot fence of poles and wire
stretched between the cliff walls there
was no gate that he could discover half
a dozen dogs had started a furious
barking above him he raised his voice
in a hail that was drowned out by the
animals after repeated shouts he was
answered by a mellow hello which
floated from some point below the
house

 you garys he shouted i want
to come up and talk to you ive got
word for you

 come up but come alone came
the reply you can get through on
the left well open up for you

  the dogs were called off and a small
section of the fence next to the cliff
lifted leaving a space wide enough for
a horse and rider to pass through
some mechanical device roane guess-
ed operated by a rope or wire from a
distance after he had ridden through
the gate dropped again with an ominous
clatter he was still in a rocky trough
some thirty feet deep

 what do you want and who are

you demanded the mellow voice com-
ing from the top of the cliff

  ive brought news of a young fellow
named tom gary and ive come to ask
about a man named carvel myself im
a stranger here-roane brandon i
came to this country to buy horses
all right leave your horse and
walk on up to the house youll find a
foot trail a little to your left

  he found it a series of steep steps
and dismounting climbed to it to fol-
low a path toward the lighted house
as he approached the building a door
opened and a man appeared and in-
vited him to enter inside he found
himself in a comfortable well furnished
ranch house the rancher was a tall
oldish fellow long-faced with a bushy
mustache the shade of bright wheat
straw and mild blue eyes

  two men had followed roane up the
path and now came into the house
they were young fellows resembling
tom gary either his younger brothers
or cousins roane guessed

  you have news of tom you said
remarked the older man

  yes he met some rider tonight on
the rim of dusk canyon not far from
the cross seven got shot roane said
briefly i heard the shooting and found
him lying there with a hole drilled in
him-just below his shoulder we put
him in a shelter off the road and looked
after him as well as we could

  the older man shook his head shot
is he im his father-clayton gary
these are his brothers ed and lee
the four of us batch here together
where did you say he was

  roane detailed the location more
fully and explained how he had found
the wounded man and with the help of
jean carvel got him to shelter and he
told also that dan carvel had headed
the previous day for the gary ranch to
hunt for his stray horses

  carvel never arrived said clayton
gary im afraid that what happened
to tom may have happened to him
those cross seven gunmen that tem-
ple and threllen have hired shoot on
canyons of the night



sight anyone not belonging to their out-
fit but i cant understand what tom
was doing over on the cross seven to-
night he knew how dangerous it was
to travel over there but come in the
kitchen well have some coffee ed
you ride up and bring down your uncle
hes my brother and a doctor he ex-
plained to roane

  in the kitchen lee gary made fresh
coffee warmed meat and biscuits roane
ate and told of the deal to buy horses
from fred temple omitting however
any mention that the thousand dollars
earnest money had been furnished by
margaret mcnab living at the cross
seven

  i cant understand what got into
tom to go over in the cross seven
neighborhood clayton gary remarked
again did he say why he rode over
there

  he was out of his head roane
replied evasively he surmised that
tom gary had been riding to the cross
seven to see linda stevens but it was
only a guess and tom garys private
business besides

  whats all this fighting over he
asked

 garys face turned bleak god
knows i dont i cant understand
what happened to addison stevens who
ran the cross seven until his health
broke and his cousin fred temple
came in addison was always friendly
and cooperated with us-we garys our
neighbors the neils and mcwhirters
we were all developing in these can-
yons of the night what we think is the
finest strain of western cow horse-
rock and mountain horses it was addi-
sons idea to cross morgans with steel-
dust strains to develop a cow horse that
had a world of bottom and spirit but
wouldnt go crazy when roping like
thoroughbreds do

  ive seen some horses out of this
country stated roane they were
good ones

 weve got hundreds of them
enough to make us all rich if wed
gather them and break them all of us

got along in here fine until addison
stevens suffered a breakdown in health
and the cross seven went downhill
addison practically owned the ranch
except for a little stock owned by his
half-brother hamlin he borrowed
money from jim coulter the hurley
saloonman-gambler and sold an inter-
est in the ranch to his cousin fred
temple whos one of these polo-play-
ing sportsmen that think they know all
about horses

linda stevens

  shortly after that addison stevens
seemed to go plumb out of his head
accused us of wanting to kill him
claimed that some of us had taken pot
shots at him we couldnt make him
believe otherwise and then one day we
found addison with my nephew lane
gary and one of the neil boys-all
three shot dead evidently in a terrible
gunfight since then theres been open
war between us and the cross seven

  clayton gary got up and poured him-
self another cup of coffee no telling
where it will stop and tom shot to-
night he shook his head

  theyve gone crazy thats what
he went on the whole stevens fam-
ily a streak of insanity runs through
the whole outfit addisons half-brother
hamlin has showed it all his life al-
ways was an excessive drinker my
brother had to treat him after the big
l

robert dale denver

sprees he used to go on if hamlin
hadnt been born in a wealthy family
hed have been put in an asylum long
ago lately fred temple and his wife
have said that they feared linda addi-
sons daughter would go insane some-
time that she was already showing
signs of it theyve brought out a nurse
from the coast to look after her id
say that were living next to an insane
asylum one that has money to hire gun-
men

 fred temple is keeping up the
feud asked roane

  keeping it up more than that hes
had his manager george threllen hire
a bunch of gun-slingers as riders tem-
ple is an ambitious sort i think he
wants this whole country and its horses
for himself and is trying to drive us
out the cross seven claims weve shot
five of their men thats a plain lie
seems to me remarked roane all
this is something for a sheriff to stop
gary snorted the sheriff that
gambler coulter is strong enough in
politics to keep the sheriff on the side
of the cross seven

  someone rode up to the house and
ed who had gone after his uncle came
in uncle will is up at the sam
neils he reported theyve ridden
to fetch him but itll be an hour or two
before he gets here

  roane got to his feet id better be
riding back then without waiting for
you he told clayton gary that
carvel girl is alone over there you
can come with your brother well look
after tom until you come ive told
you where to find the wagon

  id send one of the boys with you
offered gary but the fewer of us in
that country the better brother will
and i will get there as soon as we can
and the boys will make a search from
this end for carvel

 roane nodded back through the
fence closing the gorge he shoved his
horse hard the first gray light of dawn
was sifting into the canyons when he
climbed finally to the mesa where he
had left jean carvel he used the last

strength in the horse spurring hard
over the mesa turning off the road at
last to head for the wagon

  he smelled the smoke of the fire be-
fore he saw the wagon cover through
the trees nearer he saw someone across
the campfire-not one person but two
one was the girl her back against a
high wagon wheel holding a quirt
back to roane was a tall puncher
feinting to get in past the whip the
mans laughter came to roane as he
rode an evil sort that sent a flood of
primitive rage into roane he rode
straight in yelling in his savage rage
forgetting the carbine in a saddle scab-
bard the garys had lent him

 the man who was a black-bearded
rangy giant swung instantly seeing
the rider he dropped a hand to draw
the six-shooter from his belt holster
behind him jean carvel flashed in to
catch the mans forearm-an act that
maybe saved roane from being dumped
from the saddle as he continued to
ride in possessed with a crazy desire
to deal bare-handed with the black-
bearded brute

 roaring with anger the man-who
was the hake that had held jean cap-
tive at the attack on dan carvel-shook
off the girls grip he was too late
however to fire the six-shooter roane
had thrown himself from his saddle
catapulting himself at the stranger as
one would bulldog a steer his hun-
dred eighty pounds hit hake full tilt
sent the man to the ground with roane
on top

  hakes six-shooter exploded harm-
lessly just before it flew from his hand
to fall close to the wagon tongue

  for a second both lay still a little
dazed by the fall roane was the first
to get up but he had only reached his
knees when hake leaped at him like a
cougar bearing him to the ground
again this time with roane underneath

 roane twisted himself away and
rolling out of reach got to his feet
hake was up like a rubber ball also to
dive for the fallen six-shooter too
late jean carvel who had stood petri-
canyons of the night



gid coulter

fied rushed forward to try to kick it
out of his reach hake had it and with
a wolfish growl swung it about just as
roane diving some six feet through the
air struck hake with his shoulder
hake crashed down but this time he
held the gun he could not use it
however roane clamping hakes fore-
arm bent it back until he yelped with
pain

 the man held to the weapon like
grim death and roane lowered his hold
to hakes wrist and gun barrel slowly
he put pressure on the wrist while
hake twisted and fought furiously to
free his hand there ensued a grim
silent struggle between the pair for
the weapon with the younger roane
proving to have the superior strength
using the leverage of his long arms he
succeeded in turning the barrel toward
hakes side

  quit he ordered or youll shoot
yourself

 damn you the man grunted and
again tried savagely to wrench the gun
away the weapon was so fixed that
the hammer fired without the trigger
being pulled and the hammer had lifted
during the struggle the gun exploded
suddenly sending a shot tunneling up-
ward into hakes chest shattering his
heart the man shuddered and then
straightened out to lie inert every
muscle relaxed

  roane got up breathing hard hold-
ing the six-shooter staring down at
the dead man as he stood he swayed
a little and jean carvel thinking he
was about to collapse put her arm about
him

  im all right he told her except
that i killed a man i hoped i never
would have to do that

  he killed himself disagreed the
girl im witness to that you asked
him to quit but he wouldnt and thats
the man who shot tom gary last night
his name is hake he works for the
cross seven

 roane looked at the mans boots
they would leave tracks about the size
of those left by the man who had am-
bushed him and andy partle in camp

  after shooting gary last night the
girl went on he was afraid to risk
finishing him in the dark he went
to the ranch and came back this morn-
ing to find out what had become of
gary while hunting him he came into
camp here he caught me and began
kissing me i broke loose then he came
at me again-

  im not sorry i killed him inter-
rupted roane grimly it was a plumb
pleasure id like to do it over again
him putting his hands on you i-
his arm went about the girl youre
the bravest girl i ever knew jean to
think that this-this-but lets forget
him i reached the garys all right
but your dad hadnt shown up there
toms father and his uncle doctor will
be here soon and if theres no word of
your father by that time ill look for
him with the help of my hound hows
gary been

  she looked in the direction of the
shelter containing the wounded man
hes worse a lot worse ill have to
go back to look after him
supposing i spell you out while you
cook a breakfast here theres some-
thing else ive got to do too he
nodded at hakes body bury him and
his saddle and turn his horse loqse
hoping it wont go back to the cross
seven headquarters the horse is only
 

robert dale denver

a half-broke bronc and the chances are
hell head for the range where he was
foaled if he goes back to the ranch
they might backtrack him here unless
the rain starts again which its going
to do-those clouds mean business i
hate to bury a man without benefit of
coroner and preacher but its the only
way to make gary safe and ourselves
she nooded go ahead i can testify
later how he ended well never get
out of here ourselves unless were as
hard as men like hake she brought
two shovels from the wagon ill help
you she added practically

  no he vetoed that youve seen
too much already for a girl you get
busy on breakfast

 in an hour roane had a grave dug
and filled and hidden under the pine
needles rain had started to fall again
a slashing downpour he had looked in
on tom gary every few minutes the
boy was in a bad way no doubt about
it

  he ate a hurried breakfast with jean
they had just finished when someone
called from the brush not far from the
wagon back in the trees roane found
clayton gary and his doctor brother
will roane took them at once to the
shelter where the doctor made a care-
ful examination of his nephew

chapter v

fugitive hunt

he doctor-rancher will
gary took his nephews
pulse and temperature
shook his head tom
cant be moved far he
declared flatly i can
clean out that wound and give him
enough opiate to put him to sleep but
hed never live halfway to dawn can-
yon if we tried to move him now by
horseback the jarring would reopen
that hole and hed bleed to death the
best we could do is to take him over
part way by stretcher and the rest of
the way in  rig at night but i couldnt

recommend even that for a couple of
days

  but if we leave him here argued
clayton gary hes in danger of being
tracked down and shot by these cross
seven hounds

  i dont think hell be tracked down
after these rains stated roane they
may not even know anyone was shot
last night the man who shot him
hake came back here this morning to
hunt for tom its just possible hake
might not have told anyone of the
fight and hake sure wont tell any-
one now briefly he told the garys
of his encounter with hake

  dr gary nodded its at least safer
to leave tom here than to try to move
him on a horse leaving him in enemy
country is bad enough but it gives him
a chance at least taking him away
now means hed have none

  if hes got to stay hell have to
stay said clayton gary resignedly
ill be here with him of course you
tell me how to take care of him

  id stay myself if i could said
the doctor but with mrs sam neil
expecting a baby ive got to go back
and i couldnt do tom much good by
staying here keep his fever down
give him little to eat-thats all we can
do ill clean out this wound and well
hope that he dodges blood poisoning
and pneumonia then ill be starting
back and plan to get here again tonight
to see him

 hastily dr gary worked with the
patient after which he rode away tak-
ing a little used trail to return to
dawn canyon

  jean carvel who had stationed her-
self on a little rocky pinnacle near the
wagon to keep watch hurried to the
shelter to give warning that a group
of riders a dozen or so had come up
the road leading from the bottom of
dusk canyon threllen the cross
seven manager was leading them

  this brought a fresh complication
roane went back with the girl to the
pinnacle through the rain they saw
that all the riders except two were
canyons of the night



spreading out through the timber near
the head of the side canyon evidently
to make a search so hake had told
the cross seven that he had shot some-
one and threllen had brought men
to hunt the wounded man

  two of the party had caught sight
of the wagon cover evidently for
they were coming through the trees
toward the carvel camp jean identi-
fied one of these as threllen the other
roane recognized as fred temple

  keep cool roane told the girl
theres been enough rain to cover the
tracks of hakes horse to your wagon
tell them you havent seen him but
maybe heard a horse off in the brush
this morning and you heard no shots
last night

 roane hid in a dense thicket of
brush close to the wagon judging it
best that he be not seen in the carvel
camp threllen and temple pulled up
near the wagon to find jean washing
breakfast dishes-only one set

 your father where is he de-
manded threllen harshly i gave him
orders to travel straight on to the
garys

 the road was so bad that we
couldnt take the wagon along it re-
turned the girl spiritedly dad left
by horseback yesterday to go to the
garys he was to come back last night
but he didnt

  fred temple whose pale blue eyes
had been admiring jean carvels pretty
face and slim person pushed himself
into the talk so youre the girl who
came in here hunting stray horses he
said with a gallant sweep of his hat
and your father rode to the garys
and hasnt returned its easy to guess
whats become of him in that case

  too easy he went on with a show
of deep regret he ran into some of
these gary killers and they shot him
just as they shot my cousin and five
of our riders my name is temple i
run the cross seven may i offer you
my sympathy and protection and may
i suggest that you come to the cross
seven to stay with us until we have

definite word of your father mean-
while ill do what we can to find your
father im afraid however he added
with a shake of his head that i
cant offer too much hope

  there seemed but one thing to say
to temples offer jean had to thank
the man although she realized what
lay behind his pretended solicitude
temple plainly was a lady-killer jean
had known a few of his sort

george threllen

 we were told that one of the
garys rode over here last night and
was shot by one of our men temple
went on there must have been a
shooting scrape not far from here-
near enough for you to have heard the
shots

  im a sound sleeper the girl said
evasively

  you should have heard the shots
repeated temple if there was any
shooting maybe there was no shoot-
ing at all threllen i think hake might
have been lying he said he was com-
ing back here early to see if he could
find the man hed shot hes not here
now you didnt see him miss car-
vel

  jean hesitated i did think i heard a
horse off in the brush this morning
she said but i could have been mis-
taken

 ten to one hake was spinning us


robert dale denver

a wild yarn temple said to threllen
he claimed he recognized tom gary
but what would tom gary be doing
over here

  someone from the garys has been
close to the ranch house several times
in the last couple weeks stated
threllen twice i followed the tracks
of a horse back to gary gorge fum-
ing threllen glanced about the timber
and at the rocky rampart in which tom
gary lay i say hake wasnt lying
he did shoot somebody but whats
become of hake all this dont look
good to me if tom gary was wounded
and set afoot like hake said hes
likely hiding somewhere around here
im going to have this mesa hunted over
foot by foot well locate him if it
takes us all day threllens voice
held a stubborn determination jean
realized that he meant what he said
her heart beat fast tom gary and
his father were certain to be discovered

  the sky was clearing a little and
the rain changing to a drizzle if
threllen kept his men circling here
combing the country thoroughly they
would be sure to come to the shelter
and that meant a gun battle which
would end in both garys being
slaughtered a desperate chance had
to be taken to get them out of that
danger

  jean smiled at fred temple a plan
had flashed into her mind

  i think if you dont mind she
said ill move my wagon near your
ranch this morning mr temple and
camp there until my father has been
found

  fred temple positively beamed ap-
proval of this certainly he said
youre welcome to do that but you
dont have to camp youll be more
than welcome as a guest in our house
my wife will be glad to have you he
added

  he glanced over jeans head and
frowned suddenly why theres
linda he exclaimed followed us
up here in this rain what got into
her

  jean turned also and saw the girl
who had saved her father from a quirt-
ing riding toward the wagon this
morning linda had discarded her side
saddle and riding habit for jeans a
mans shirt slicker and stock saddle
jean noticed as the girl pulled up near
the wagon that the pale face was tense
drawn and the eyes were red as if from
weeping

  jean promptly poured a cup of steam-
ing coffee and took it to the girl linda
stevens took it with a trembling hand
fred temple and threllen had with-
drawn a little distance to talk which
gave jean her chance she signalled
to the girl to move her horse a few
paces so that both she and linda would
be only a few feet from roane bran-
dons hiding place-so close that he
could overhear their talk

 you know tom gary jean asked
directly

  the girl stared at her in wide-eyed
surprise i know him yes she ad-
mitted hesitantly i knew him years
ago he and his brothers came to our
ranch to attend school

 you dont hate him 

  the girls fingers tightened on the
handle of the cup no i dont hate
him she said huskily but how do
you know about tom you have seen
him tell me what happened

  youre willing to help him per-
sisted jean

  yes anything believe me id do
anything for him i have to listen to
threllen and temple and the rest talk
of murdering the garys but i love
tom hes been coming to the ranch
secretly to see me although each trip
has meant risking his life he was to
come last night but he didnt some-
thing happened to him at the ranch
this morning i heard that hake
claimed to have shot one of the garys
-tom he thought tell me what hap-
pened

 hake did shoot tom gary shot
him from his saddle but hes still alive
weve been taking care of him hes
not far away from here now too close
canyons of the night



to be safe threllen is hunting this
mesa and hell be found sure theres
no time to lose he needs your help

  the soul of the girl was revealed
in the sudden illumination that came
to her face ill do anything she
repeated what can i do tell me

  jeans voice became matter-of-fact
casual youve got to calm yourself
first im going to hitch up the team
to the wagon and move down canyon
to be near your ranch i want you to
ride into the rocks where you see those
two dead pines leaning against each
other a few yards west of there youll
find tom gary and his father you
must tell his father its necessary to
move his son at once and the only way
to do that is to get him to the wagon
theres a stretcher in the shelter that
can be used to bring him here once
here we can hide him in the back ill
drive close to the cross seven head-
quarters tom can stand only a short
trip otherwise id take him to hurley
do you understand

  linda stevens nodded yes bring
him to the ranch well find a place
to hide him there in the cliffs

  threllen had ridden away to join his
men but temple was lingering near
the wagon

 when you come back jean went
on youve got to get temple away
from here without making him sus-
picious

  after the girl had ridden into the
trees jean hurried to get the gray team
harnessed roane brandon she knew
would follow linda stevens to the
shelter and help gary move his son
jean found herself working in a frenzy
of haste with her fingers all thumbs
then she suddenly got hold of herself
a mans life-no the lives of three
men roane tom and tom garys
father-were at stake with the team
hooked to the wagon she loaded up
the camp gear spreading her bed in the
back for tom gary

 when she began work fred temple
lazily sat his horse nearby chatting
plainly liking to talk with a pretty

young stranger but when linda
stevens returned she soon disposed of
temple challenging him to hurdle
some fallen trees temple preferred
showing off his riding skill of which
he was plainly proud even to talking
to jean little by little by inducing
temple to race his horse against hers
linda got temple out of sight of the
wagon

 jean stood guard while roane and
clayton gary brought the wounded
man from the brush to load him into
the vehicle then roane went back for
the bed and tarpaulin while gary
crawled in beside his son

  it will be a hard ride for him
jean said

  its not far to the cross seven
said clayton gary theyll never think
to look for tom there it was a smart
idea you had well get him away as
soon as we can though if we have to
carry him every foot on a stretcher
im afraid to trust the stevens girl
with a secret like this she may mean
well toward tom but shes got an
insane streak in her same as the rest
of the family

 jean went into the brush to meet
roane who had brought the bedroll
placed in the back of the wagon it
would serve as a screen for the garys

 roane looked at her youre a
smart brave girl he told her warmly
im riding out now taking clayton
garys horse with me to turn loose
it wont do to have him found around
here then im riding to meet my
partner want to get my hound to
help hunt for your father its rained
too much for a dog to find old trails
but savvy hes not an ordinary dog
id like something your father has
worn

  theres an old soft leather pair of
shoes he wears around camp she
said ill get one of them

  fine if hes afoot and wandering
about savvy can cut his trail in a
hurry ill see you at the cross seven
tonight and ill hope to have good
news for you


robert dale denver

 jean forgot the danger and worry
for a moment looking at roane bran-
don youll be running the risk of
being shot yourself she told him
all this is shooting country be care-
ful

  you be careful he ordered youre
taking a lot of chances yourself doing
this for tom cary he grinned the
more i see of you the more willing i
am to wait for you until im forty
but only if i have to he added

  a little later she sat in the front of
the wagon she spoke to the team and
the grays moved out

chapter vi

cross seven ranch

he wagon following the
road down the side can-
yon bumped terribly as
its steel-rimmed wheels
hammered over stones
jean flinched with each
jar as if she were the wounded man
in the back behind her tom gary
occasionally broke out into a delirious
mutter which his father tried to quiet

  reaching dusk canyon they turned
down it toward the cross seven head-
quarters they had traveled a little
over a mile along this when a rider
galloped up alongside the wagon-
linda stevens who had managed to
leave fred temple behind

  jean stopped the wagon

 hes all right linda asked
anxiously

  tom garys father was looking over
jeans shoulder at the rider with so
forbidding a face that linda stevens
shivered

  and what is it to you how he is
gary growled

 she had nothing to do with tom
being shot jean put in sharply feel-
ing pity for the pale-faced girl

  there is no blame to her for the
shooting gary was forced to admit
but her relatives are responsible and
i promise you miss stevens well get

tom away from the cross seven neigh-
borhood tonight if its possible

 there is no need to hurry him
away protested linda you mustnt
move him until hes well enough

  garys face was stern that is for
us to judge he declared there is
no safety for him near the cross seven
ranch any more than if we were in a
nest of- evidently he had intended
to say rattlesnakes but he did not
finish

 the wagon rumbled on again with
linda stevens riding a little ahead
the canyon was widening now on the
left were slopes covered thickly with
pines on the right rose sheer cliffs
now the ranch came in sight lying in
the wide cleft made by a side canyon
below near the creek were the corrals
sheds stables and a bunkhouse the
latter built of thin slabs of red rock
several hundred yards above sat the
ranch house

  it sprawled under a huge wedge of
wall a big rock dwelling built in some
respects like an english castle with
little towers and the side walls ex-
tended above the roof in a parapet
which was cut with slits designed in the
old days for the use of archers the
walls had been built of thin rock laid
by expert workmen shrubs trees and
stretches of green lawn lay in terraces
in front and at the side of the house
it all looked like a pretentious city
mansion and was as out of place in
this country as a herd of giraffes or
zebras

  behind the house lifted cliffs blood-
red in color the kind of red that is
somber and gloomy with a few pinions
and junipers that did little to soften
the somber walls in places the cliffs
mounted in sheets of solid rock like
curtains hung from the rims to the
canyon floor in other places they had
been weathered into towers obelisks
various-shaped domes and cubes

  linda stevens pointed to a break in
the cliff a quarter of a mile or so
further on and about the same distance
from the ranch theres a good place
canyons of the night



to camp she remarked i played in
there as a child we children had a
secret house back under the cliff in
a thicket

 jean stopped the team when they
reached the place linda had pointed
out clumps of thick brush choked
the entrance to the little break in the
cliff walls the wagon could be so
drawn up that tom gary could be
carried from it directly into the brush

  she looked back inquiringly at gary
and when he nodded his approval she
guided the team into the open space
halting the wagon so that the back of
it was close to the thicket then she got
down to follow gary who had slipped
out to enter the brushy covert through
growth so thick that they had to force
their way through it thirty yards or
so and they found the remains of an
old play-house from a low-branched

andy partle

tree nearby a tarpaulin could be rigged
to make a shelter tent

 while linda acted as lookout in
case anyone should ride up gary and
jean got the wounded man back
through the brush with difficulty after
that jean gathered wood and built a
fire near the wagon linda stevens
would have stayed but she realized
that she could be of no help and she
was only disturbing toms father by
being there reluctantly she went back

to the ranch while jean made a broth
for the wounded man from fresh meat
she and her father had brought with
them

 andy partle came along shortly
leading two pack horses roane had
met him he told jean and had saddled
a horse and ridden out with savvy to
hunt for dan carvel andy brought
jeans saddle hidden in a bedroll

  just leave it to roane andy as-
sured her believe it or not but
roanes just got a instinct for finding
critters he kin jist size up a country
and seem to know where to look for
what hes huntin-bar or cougar or
horses or cattle while that dog savvy
has got the high-poweredest nose i ever
seen in a dog they make a pair those
two they found a dead man one time
after the country had been gone over
inch by inch of course he added
hastily your pa aint dead hell turn
up alive

  jean tried to believe that but it
was hard if her father had met with
an accident it seemed an impossible
task for a man and a dog to find him
in a strange country where rain had
certainly washed out all tracks and
yet she had faith in that young fel-
low who seemed somehow to be part
of the canyons the trees the mountain
peaks he reminded her of the stories
she had heard of the fur trappers the
buckskin clad men who had wandered
easily into every corner of the un-
explored west often through hostile
indian tribes in the strange insane
world of the mighty canyons into
which she and her father had traveled
where cruelty and murder ruled roane
brandon was a stalwart refuge

 the day dragged by andy partle
wandered up to the cross seven and
was gone for several hours clayton
gary watched by the side of his son
jean dozed a little and came to with a
start the skies were clouded again
rain was falling on distant peaks
standing not ten feet from her was
a man of medium height rather
chunky with a sharp-featured face and


robert dale denver

dark prominent eyes that shone with a
malicious delight he was dressed in
slovenly fashion but carried an ex-
pensive hunting rifle

 jean was frightened there was
something terrifying about the man
although he smiled at her have no
fear he said it is only hamlin
stevens completely and entirely harm-
less and youre the little girl whose
father has been lost he made a
clucking noise of sympathy and then
smiled again

  this she realized must be linda
stevens uncle her fathers half-
brother while she looked at him
fearfully the man suddenly wheeled
galvanized into action bringing his
rifle to his shoulder he pumped all the
shots in the magazine apparently at a
blank spot-the cliff opposite then
chuckling to himself he strolled on

  she waited a little and then went
back to reassure gary about the shoot-
ing

 hamlin stevens is crazy he
growled raving mad oughtnt to
be allowed to carry a gun a no-good
that all but drank himself to death
when he was young a wastrel never
did a days work in his life traveled
back and forth to europe until his
inheritance was all used up

  the shots had brought linda stevens
hurrying down to camp afoot she
was shaking with fear believing that
tom gary had been found from the
ever-ready coffee-pot jean poured a
cup of hot liquid for her while she
explained the firing

  uncle hamlin should be in an asy-
lum everyone says stated linda
my father got him out of plenty of
scrapes hes never been responsible
both my uncle and i would be far bet-
ter off dead-like dad she went on
bitterly were no good to the world
but i should keep such talk to myself
you have your own troubles with your
father missing she reproached her-
self

  dads all right said jean with a
confidence she was far from feeling

anyway ill believe that hes all
right until i have word that he isnt
what good is there in worrying until
then

 none admitted linda but you
have nothing to blame yourself for
with me its different my caring for
someone resulted in his getting shot
his family hates all of us at the cross
seven and i dont blame them and i
cant be of much help to him now
when hes in trouble i couldnt even
save his life if they were to find him
her tone changed i want to ask you
jean to come up to the ranch for
supper tonight-aunt erica insists on
calling it dinner out here on a ranch
fred temple suggested that i ask you
and i want you to meet nab my nurse
when i was a child andy partle knew
her when he worked here years ago
hes been up there talking to her for
hours

  jean hesitated she did not trust
fred temple and the further she kept
from him the better george threllen
was a merciless brute but she felt
safer with him than with temple she
did not want to go to the ranch but
she could not refuse lindas invitation

  linda waited while jean got ready
to go to the house and together the
two girls walked down canyon to head
for the grassy terraces below the house
as they passed through a gate in a
high carefully trimmed hedge they
came on a tall sleek-haired woman
cutting flowers from a little garden
plot

  aunt erica said linda this is
jean carvel

 erica temple a tight-mouthed
woman who looked older than her hus-
band looked at jean from cold eyes
she nodded slightly dismissing jean
as of no consequences

  an older woman had appeared-tall
raw-boned this was margaret mc-
nab who had been lindas childhood
nurse she was a thin angular woman
with hair so colorless and unattractive
it could not have been helped by any-
thing except a wig she bunched it up
canyons of the night



carelessly and let it go at that she
had long bony hands and a voice as
rough as a rasp despite all this jean
liked the woman at once she was
plainly so blunt and honest and good-
hearted

  the three went into one wing of the
big house where a living room and two
bedrooms made lindas suite of rooms
nab settled down to knitting making
her needles click

  if you take my advice both of you
she said in her mannish voice you
girls will both get out of here take
two horses and hightail it tonight and
keep riding until you are out of the
country its madness to stay here

  its madness agreed linda stevens
despondently thats just it-mad-
ness

  nab laid down her knitting needles
linda thinks she told jean that
shes losing her mind going insane
she thinks it runs in the family thats
what the temples say but i say theyre
wrong they claim her pa went crazy
and got in a quarrel with the garys
and started all this war i say its non-
sense her uncle hamlin is sort of
crazy but only from booze and any-
way hes only her fathers half-
brother

  uncle hamlin says it runs back in
the family for generations said the
girl dully he says thats why he
first started drinking knowing he
couldnt marry with the chance of hav-
ing his children tainted by insanity
the temples are right i feel that i
am losing my mind

 ive got something to tell you
linda said nab those men in here
-andy partle and that fellow he
brought with him-theyre here to help
you theyre not here to buy horses
i asked andy to come in here to help
you i sent him a thousand dollars so
they could come in here and deal for
horses with fred temple and i
wouldnt have done that if i thought
anything was wrong with your mind
linda

 why nab exclaimed linda and

hugged the woman hard you were
foolish to use your money for that
and i once even thought youd turned
against me that you were looking after
me because you thought i was going
insane

  thats how i got the temples to
let me come here nab explained to
jean they were to pay me a lot of
money to testify when a hearing is
held to decide if linda is what they
call mentally competent or not theyre
the worst people i ever saw those two
deliberately trying to ruin a young
girls life by getting her declared in-
sane when its all nonsense

  across the court a door was thrown
violently open and hamlin stevens
emerged in his shirt sleeves wearing
flapping slippers carrying the hunting
rifle he raised the weapon and emptied
it at a canyon wall then reloading in
a frenzy of haste he emptied the gun
again

  linda walked out into the court to
take the mans arm and talking to him
soothingly conducted him back to his
quarters

  hamlin busts out that crazy way
about every so often said nab quiet-
ly but its only natural after all the
whiskey hes downed as a nurse ive
seen a lot of whiskey-swillin hogs but
never one to compare with him

 a gong summoned them to dinner
and when linda returned the three
went into a hall-like room where a
stingy fire burned cheerlessly in a huge
fireplace fred temple and his wife
appeared temple to rush forward to
try to take jeans hands she dodged
him aware of the glinting eyes of
erica temple

 they ate in a dining room which
wouldnt have been much larger in a
real castle with heavy oak beams and
paneled walls of dark wood it was a
dreary sort of meal with only candles
for light and a bald chinaman serving
fred temple tried to make light talk
with compliments to jean and his light
blue eyes never left her

  hamlin stevens came in to take a


robert dale denver

place when they were about through
he did not eat he only stared around
the table at everybody from his bugged-
out eyes chuckling to himself occa-
sionally linda was the only one who
tried to talk to him but he paid no
attention to what she said

  finally with a sharp sarcastic ex-
cuse me he got up quickly and disap-
peared

  finished with the meal the others
went back into the hall-like room

  ill have to start back said jean
wanting desperately to leave

  nab and i will walk down to your
camp with you linda offered

  do you think its safe for you to go
out at night linda asked erica
temple some of these gary killers
may be lurking around waiting to kill
you as they killed your father

  im not afraid of the garys and
i dont believe they killed father
stated linda in a sudden flash of spirit
theyre not killers

  both the temples gazed at linda
and in the silence a pin dropped on
the tiled-in front of the fireplace would
have sounded as loud as a shot

  then you dont know what you are
saying said erica temple in a sud-
den rage defending your fathers
murderers

 linda stevens had shown spirit
against threllen in compelling the re-
lease of dan carvel but now the flash
of independence died swiftly and she
seemed only to cower no i dont
know what im saying she admitted
tonelessly

  we will forget what you said said
erica temple we know you are
afraid that these dark canyons terrify
you you must not forget what hap-
pened to your father and you must
hate these people who murdered him
they are your enemies the woman
went on in her hard smooth voice
and we must be careful dear not to
let fear get the best of us fear in
your case is fatal you know what it
will lead to you know your weakness
you must guard yourself

 yes aunt erica said the girl
meekly

 as for you child fred temple
said to jean i think youd better
stay here in the house its safer those
horse-buyers-we dont know anything
about them and they are camped not
far from you i think you should stay
here at the house where we can look
after you

  id prefer to be in camp jean said
calmly

  temple glared at his wife evidently
blaming her for the girls refusal to
stay in the ranch house

 tomorrow well see what we can
do in trying to find your father my
dear he promised and took one of
her hands jean withdrew it and
shivered more and more she disliked
and feared this temple

 back at the carvel wagon linda
stevens asked to see tom gary if only
for a moment the wounded man was
breathing hard tossing about restlessly
muttering deliriously linda came
back to the wagon with tears in her
eyes nab as a nurse went to look
at him and make fresh bandages for
him then the two women returned to
the ranch

 andy partle wandered down to
jeans camp roane had not yet re-
turned from his search he reported
jean could see that the oldish man was
worried

chapter vii

night boat

oanes partner was
worried and with
good reason certain-
ly roane was in
danger of being shot
by both sides in the
canyons off the night
river

 there had been no sign all day of
threllen and the riders that had been
making a search on the mesa for tom
gary but now the cavalcade of riders
canyons of the night



came loping down the canyon with a
sudden outburst of yells to pull up at
the corrals below the ranch house
lights came on in the bunkhouse

  andy partle went in to talk to clay-
ton gary whom andy had known when
he had ridden for the cross seven he
came out finally yawning drowsily
and headed for the camp he had made
not far from jeans wagon

  the lights in the bunkhouse went
out and the canyon became quiet with
the storm cleared away the night was
still so still that jean could hear the
occasional restless muttering of tom
gary she sat down with her back
against a bedroll and dozed a little

  and then as if he had materialized
there by magic roane was in camp
smiling at jean over the fire

  found your dad he reported his
leg was broken his horse had been

nab

shot from ambush but your father
managed to get away-dragged him-
self into some rocks likely some cross
seven man tried to get him i got him
on a horse and took him to the garys
doc gary set his leg and hes resting
easy except that hes worried about
you

 you found him she could only
exclaim at first while relief and grati-
tude flooded her andy told me you
would

  thank savvy he said referring to
the black-and-tan hound he ran on
to the fresh trails of three different
mountain lions but i kept him to the
notion he was hunting a man finding
him was luck mostly-and savvy i
left savvy at the garys-he was foot-
sore youd better travel over there
tonight and get out of this country
but i cant do that she pointed
out if i went away the cross seven
would be sure to find tom gary unless
we could take him with us

  we cant do that tonight doc gary
cant come over tonight he has to at-
tend a sick neighbor woman hows
tom been

  as well as could be expected still
out of his head

  they plan to move him tomorrow
night doc gary said it wouldnt be
safe any sooner theyre bringing a
buckboard tomorrow night to the top
of the mesa and theyll carry him to
it by stretcher youll leave then too
and you she asked

  im staying here to get some of
those night canyon horses theyre
the finest ive seen anywhere the
country is full of them

  are they worth risking your life
for

  sure he said besides i like this
country id like to ranch here in
these canyons trap beaver in the
upper streams and hunt the mountain
lions that are killing off colts this
is horse country if i ever saw one he
was looking at her smiling a little his
eyes glowing i always knew it he
said abruptly

  knew what she asked surprised
knew that when i saw a certain face
across a campfire id know that face
belonged to the girl id like to see
across my fire always you fit in with
an outdoor fire jean

  she laughed at that you say the
queerest things sometimes roane
brandon who else would ever tell a
girl that she fitted in with an outdoor
fire

  sounds foolish i guess but its not


robert dale i jver

looking across a fire at a girl seems
the most natural way to me of looking
at a girl my partner tells me i ought
to have been born sixty years ago so
i could have been a trapper but i like
living in a house-a good log house
and i can build one too ill have you
know im going to build one for the
girl i marry as many rooms in it as
she wants and im not joking

  i know youre not roane she
said quietly and when dad and i
get back to our ranch youll come to
see us weve got a big fireplace and
i want to see how you look by the
light of it but that will be when
were all out of these canyons of the
night-if we ever are

  roane stepped close to her and put
his arm over her shoulders lightly
look he said dont you go getting
afraid now after its all over to-
morrow night youll be safe and happy
with your father over in dawn can-
yon

  she was very still a moment then
but you wont be going with us
youll be staying here

  and will that make a difference to
you he asked

  her eyes met him yes it will
roane

  i like to hear you say that he
told her gravely his arm tightened
about her drawing her to him but
ive got to stay here jean andy and
i came in here to help linda stevens
andys friend-that mcnab woman-
paid a lot of money so we could come
in

  she was silent her slim figure rigid

  you persuade linda to leave with
you and ill go along said roane

  is that a promise she demanded
swiftly

  its a promise its little to what
id really do for you jean when
youre out of this i want to tell you
just how much i would like to do for
you-including that big log house
built to your order

  he thought of her smile as he went
to the camp andy partle had made

and there near exhaustion from his
two trips to the gary ranch and his
long search for jeans father he rolled
in and slept like a dead man but he
was awake before daylight joining
andy partle who was up getting
breakfast andy was in a sober mood
to him the situation was as dangerous
as a family of children playing with a
box of dynamite caps

  roane agreed but had he only him-
self to worry about he would have
been enjoying the danger these deep
canyons the horses that ranged on the
mesas above the deadly feud even
attracted him this cross seven pre-
sented a problem to him like that of
catching some renegade shrewd old
silvertip only this situation was one
of human minds and human hands that
could shoot deadly guns he had re-
assured jean carvel that the danger was
practically over but he knew it wasnt
for one thing too many people knew
of the presence of the wounded tom
gary the girl linda in love with the
young fellow might give away the
dangerous secret in a dozen ways

  only thing to do said andy is to
git all these females and gary out of
here tonight

  thats a large party to move with- 
out any of these cross seven riders
finding out about it

  no matter either we all git out
or else were all gone goslins that
temple and threllen are snake bloods
from what nab told me if they sus-
pected we aint in here to buy horses
wed be in hot water quick

  they were eating breakfast when the
cross seven crew of riders started
from the corrals led by threllen both
roane and andy put rifles under bed-
rolls where they could be yanked out
quickly and stuck six-shooters under
their jackets threllen rode up to the
fire

 i heard you brought in a hound
is he any good at trailing demanded
threllen

  hes got a nose can smell said
roane but not after these rains
canyons of the night



besides hes off hunting somewhere
now

  trouble with that hound he trails
the wrong direction sometimes put
in andy like he started off wrong
way on a turkey trail oncet and finally
landed back at the egg shells out o
which theyd been hatched out that
spring

  this was a favorite humorous yarn
among hunters but it brought no smile
from threllen

 one of them garys was up on that
mesa night before last he said harsh-
ly and hake shot him outa the
saddle hakes disappeared and we
havent been able to find that gary
its my idea some people know more
about that than theyre tellin and are
keepin their mouths shut i got a
hunch someone hid that man from us
and that might be some of you
strangers one thing he growled
youll get no horses from this ranch
we got none to sell he rejoined his
men and they rode on up the canyon
presumably to take up the hunt again

 andy and roane looked after the
cavalcade that feller gives me a
chill commented old andy sooner
we git outa here the better ill like
it he suspects us he may even git
around to suspectin we got tom gary
hid down here and then therell be hell
to pay in big chunks

  the day passed by slowly several
times linda came down with nab to
visit the carvel camp they brought
news of a heated quarrel between the
temples ending in mrs temple de-
parting for hurley in a buckboard
driven by one of the ranch hands the
woman often left the ranch after
quarreling with her husband said nab
jean suggested that linda and nab go
to the garys that night but the girl
replied that she was not wanted by the
garys and had too much pride to
force herself on them there was no
changing her mind 

  roane had ridden out to pretend to
look for carvel again during the ride
he was trailed by several of the cross

seven riders and he dared not go to the
gary ranch

  twice during the day hamlin stevens
came by with his rifle to send a sense-
less burst of shots at a bare cliff wall

  in the late afternoon threllen and
the cross seven crew returned to the
ranch roane came in before sunset
andy partle told him what news there
was a half-mile up the canyon in a
brush clump andy had discovered a
buckboard that had been abandoned
with a broken tongue evidently shoved
off the road and forgotten andy had
spliced the broken tongue and bound it
with rawhide strips to make the rig
serviceable it represented a possible
way of taking out tom gary if it be-
came necessary it should not be
needed if the garys arrived as planned
to carry tom to the top of the mesa
where a rig was to be waiting to trans-
port him the rest of the way home

  the sun set leaving a clear sky
roane would have preferred a clouded
one there were a lot of men working
for the cross seven andy said he had
counted nearly twenty just after sun-
set several more came in from the di-
rection of hurley some more recruits
for the cross seven army andy re-
marked

  according to the plan the garys
were due to arrive an hour or so before
midnight twilight came roane re-
gretted that they had not set an earlier
hour he scented danger there was a
lot of restless activity at the cross
seven corrals

 down canyon men came from the
bunkhouse to go to the corrals to sad-
dle a dozen mfen led by threllen
raced up canyon to pull in suddenly
by the campfire where andy partle
and roane were cooking supper the
riders gathered in a semi-circle about
the two

  i told you birds said threllen
that you arent gettin any horses from
this ranch so git out-now

  now said andy startled that
meant the end of their plan to take
jean carvel linda stevens and nab


robert dale denver

out of the country-and to help tom
gary get back home

  now repeated threllen harshly
git your horses packed and pull your
freight

  how about the thousand dollars we
paid as earnest money to temple
inquired roane

  talk to him about that growled
threllen we dont want you in this
country thats all

  talking to temple is just what well
do said roane promptly

 yeah we demand to see fred
temple said andy partle we made
a deal with him and hes running this
ranch

  he just thinks hes runnin it
stated threllen you two are gittin
off the range and doin it quick youre
not talking to temple youre leavin
we dont want strangers in here we
dont know if you belong to the gary
tribe or not but some queer things
has happened since you come in one
bein that our man hake has never
showed up and we found his horse
runnin loose without his saddle and
bridle

  but argued partle we paid a
thousand dollars down and were en-
titled to take out at least a few head
of horses it wouldnt take a day to
get the ten head we paid for

  no said threllen raising his voice
almost to a shout git your loads on
your pack horses and git ready to
travel im sendin some men with you
to see that you go to hurley theyll
take you down the night river by a
short cut

  there was nothing that they could
do they couldnt fight nearly a dozen
men who were plainly prepared to go
into action at a word from threllen

  andy partle shrugged looks like
we got our tickets bought for the train
and the conductor is yellin all
aboard  he remarked

  silently he and roane cinched pack
saddles on their two horses and loaded
them throwing diamond hitches over
topping bedrolls while threllens

party watched then satisfied threl-
len turned to go back to the ranch

  one final thing he said dont
you come back in here you two what-
ever you do

  roane caught half grins on the faces
of several of the men at this remark
he guessed the reason for their
amusement

  with four men riding behind them
he and andy started out each leading
a packed horse jean carvel was wait-
ing by the wagon and roane pulled
up to talk to her while andy arranged
his mount and pack horse to keep their
escort of four men back out of ear-
shot 

  dont worry roane said in a low
voice threllen told us to pull out
but we wont go far well come back
tonight and well all get over to the
garys if we have to well hitch your
team to that buckboard andy fixed and
take gary out in it

 those four men with you she
whispered i dont like their looks
neither do i said roane not
well enough for em to be behind me
ive got a hunch theyre to make sure
we dont come back well take care
of them

  the moon pushed up as the six jog-
ged on down canyon heading for the
big canyon of the night river the
four men following grew careless
roane wasnt sure that they had actu-
ally been detailed to kill them but
threllen he was convinced had a great
deal more against them than just sus-
picion

 andy partle had no doubts what-
ever but that their mission had been
discovered and the men following them
had orders to kill them the big can-
yon of the night river was opening
below and the dull boom of the river
came to their ears the night would
make a good burial place for two
strangers bodies dumped into its
sandy current would never appear
again when the trail narrowed so
that they would have to ride single
file the men behind could blast andy
canyons of the night



and roane out of their saddles and
roll their bodies into the river

  to roane this affair had more and
more of the certain air of an execu-
tion executions however could back-
fire he and andy still had their six-
shooters under their jackets and andy
partle was a tough coot who could
strike with the speed of a rattler

fred temple

roane muttered a few words to him as
the trail began to narrow passing into
the deep shadow of a cliff wall

  behind them the four were riding
in pairs smoking talking a few yards
ahead huge boulders bordered the
trail coming to these as the trail
curved a little roane and andy swung
quickly down one on each side of the
trail with the move they drew their
six-shooters covering the riders be-
hind them it was simple because the
move had been entirely unexpected

  lift your blasted paws yelled
andy or well blow you to pieces
roane had scrambled to the top of a
boulder from which he could see every
move the four made they were caught
flat-footed one man who had been
carrying his rifle over his saddle horn
hesitated but only a moment raising
his hands with the rest letting the
weapon fall

  while roane kept them covered

andy took their guns working care-
fully at their backs shucking them of
rifles and sixguns and searching them
afterward for hidden weapons

  what we doin with em inquired
roane

 make em jump in the river
snapped andy partle promptly these
birds were sent to kill us well just
do the same to them

 we wasnt sent to kill you
whined one of the four just to see
that you went to hurley

  dont lie to us growled old andy
tell the truth and well give you a
chance to live lie and well dump you
outa your saddles

 were only doin what were
ordered said one of the four we
draw our pay they got word in hur-
ley you was spies of the garys-least-
wise thats what threllen told us
and you were to shoot us and throw
us in the river asked andy sternly

 yeah admitted the same man
that was it theres a big battle com-
ing up in these canyons and we couldnt
let no spies be in so close to the
ranch gid coulter is bringin out more
men tonight and him and threllen is
startin a big gun cleanup of this
country tomorrow

  coulter sent out word about us
asked roane

  yeah that you wasnt horse buyers
he telegraphed out about you and
found you didnt have ten thousand
dollars to buy horses with like you
claimed

  hes a smart bird that coulter
admitted andy and now what to
do with these buzzards

  roane glanced at a log on the river
bank a big cottonwood that had been
grounded there by a flood that would
make a good boat for these birds he
suggested well take off their boots
so they wont walk back and let em
float down the river

puttin us into the river on that
log protested one immediately its
plain murder theres rapids below
in that case you can beach the


robert dale denver

log before you get to the rapids and
head back to the ranch barefoot it
may take you a day or so for the trip
but they wont be needing you there
anyway meanwhile we want seiior
threllen to think that were floating
down the river

  the men had no choice but to obey
sullenly they took off their boots and
after a great deal of effort managed to
roll the log into the river then they
straddled the log and the sluggish
shore current slowly took the strange
boat out into the stream

  they rode fast until they neared the
cross seven again lights burned in
the bunkhouse besides the main house
cautiously they kept to the slope op-
posite the ranch until they were above
the carvel camp roane went down
to find jean sitting by the fire

  you came back she exclaimed at
sight of him those men-

 figured to kill us but we gave
them a little boat ride in return sent
em off down the river on a log

 his arm went around her drawing
her close we got to make tracks out
of this country fast were not waiting
for the garys well hitch your team
to that old buckboard for an ambulance
for tom we got to take nab and
linda stevens with us theres horses
for everybody do you think you could
sneak up to the house and get nab and
linda to come down here tell them
a big war is due to break in this coun-
try coulter is bringing out a bunch
of men tonight to start a real war
weve got to travel to dawn canyon
where well be with friends

chapter viii

unseen assassin

ean carvel had no
trouble in getting to the
cross seven ranch house un-
detected lights still burned
in several of the rooms but
those occupied by linda and
nab were dark the two were evidently

asleep linda had not been told that
the garys were coming to take tom
away toms father had been afraid
that she might reveal the secret jean
reaching one of the windows of the
suite occupied by the two women rap-
ped on it lightly

  someone stirred in a bed and the
nurse nab came to the window her
gaunt figure attired in a high-necked
nightgown

  theres to be real war started in
here tomorrow gid coulter is bring-
ing out a bunch of men from hurley
andy and roane say weve got to leave
jean explained in a whisper threllen
sent four men out tonight with andy
and roane to kill them but they sent
the four men down the river on a log
were all to go to the garys tonight
and weve got to leave at once tell
linda she cant stay here any longer

  ill tell her and ill be thankin
the lord on my knees when and if we
git outa here said the nurse ive
expected to wake up and find myself
killed in my bed almost any night for
a long time hark

  horses were riding down canyon to
the ranch-at least a dozen of them
these jean guessed would be the
group brought by gid coulter one
rider came straight to the house the
others went to the bunkhouse below
threllens voice came greeting the
newcomer

  acting on an impulse while nab
and linda stevens were getting ready
jean went through the dark courtyard
toward the lighted windows of the
big hall-like room keeping close to
the shadow of the wall the windows
of the room were uncurtained a tall
raw-boned husky with a hooked nose
was entering threllen following fred
temple was already in the room

  this is an unexpected pleasure see-
ing you out here coulter temple said
in his arrogant way

  i could do with a drink said
coulter and going to a cabinet
brought out a whiskey decanter and a
glass and poured liquor then throw-
canyons of the night



ing the drink down his throat he
wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand

  temple you been botchin up things
out here he said deliberately i told
you not to deal with those two men
that said they wanted to buy horses
they didnt come here for horses
someone had em come in here-we
dont know who whoever it was paid
that thousand dollars just to get that
pair to the ranch threllen has had
them taken care of but it could have
been serious you dont seem to realize
youre not really running the ranch
temple

  no sneered temple as admin-
istrator of the stevens estate i con-
trol most of the common stock of the
cross seven company in addition to
the stock i own personally

  stock coulter laughed just a
lot of paper he poured himself an-
other drink youre a slick one
temple it was a slick idea making
people think addison stevens had gone
crazy before he was killed and ar-
ranging it to get the daughter de-
clared crazy legally-and meanwhile
tryin to drive her crazy you figured
it would be easy to prove hamlin
stevens insane and with the girl and
uncle declared loco by a court youd
have the same as sole ownership of the
whole ranch

  temple shrugged no trick to it
everyone knows about hamlin and its
been my opinion that linda is not
mentally responsible we now have
the evidence to show it in court mrs
mcnab a graduate nurse will testify
that the girl is not responsible

 a wonderful scheme remarked
coulter but its got one bad flaw
youve been fool enough to overlook
one thing

  temple stiffened i dont like your
talk gid

  the saloonman-gambler shrugged
youll have to learn to like it im
taking charge here tonight threllen
and the others will be taking my or-
ders-not yours

  jean carvel crouched outside the
open window was watching and listen-
ing so intently that she almost forgot
to breathe it was like a scene from a
play but no play could ever be a tenth
as dramatic to her it seemed that
coulter was playing with the hapless
temple as the proverbial cat with its
proverbial mouse

  threllen said temple see that
this fellow leaves the ranch and doesnt
come back

  threllen was humorless there was
not the ghost of a grin on his face
he merely remained grimly silent

  gid coulter however grinned wol-
fishly and temple realized suddenly
what he was up against that threllen
was coulters man and that the other
men on the ranch would take threl-
lens orders

  i see he said there seems noth-
ing for me to do but to leave you in
charge and have you thrown out in the
courts that wont be difficult i can
get friends to advance me enough to
pay off the money you loaned to the
ranch

  coulters grin widened courts is
it were in a canyon of the river
night a long ways from a court
temple i hand it to you youve been
playing a slick game to get this ranch
by shutting up your relatives for in-
sanity and at the same time driving
out your neighbors youre a good
enough horseman to know the ranch
is a millon-dollar proposition here
that the horses running on the range
could bring in a couple hundred thou-
sand dollars cash sold to the right
parties a slick game temple but
youre licked

  well see declared temple con-
fidently you cant scare me if any-
thing happens to me here thered be
an inquiry that would send you to the
gallows ive got friends behind me
my wife would see to it that theyd
send in a bunch of detectives
would they now asked coulter
and chuckled detectives wouldnt
get far in this country im not trying


robert dale denver

to scare you im just making an offer
ive got a few papers that either you
sign or you dont leave here alive
he brought out a long heavy envelope
from his pocket

  ill be damned if i sign anything
snarled temple you cant bluff me
in signing these papers said
coulter you admit to being respon-
sible for the killing of a few men in-
cluding addison stevens you admit
also to having made it look as if addi-
son stevens got in a fight with one of
the garys and neils when they wer
really killed separately by your hired
gunmen and the bodies arranged so it
would be laid to a gun battle and you
admit that you started a war of ex-
termination against your neighbors
im damned if i sign any such
thing burst out temple

 youll be damned if you dont
coulters sixgun slithered up out of
its holster the night river has
covered up a lot of bodies in its time
its big enough to cover yours too
you cant shoot a man in cold blood
coulter protested temple youre
not as low as that

  coulters smile only widened and
temple turned to threllen standing
watching quietly

  threllen you wont let him do it
temple appealed to his employee
you wouldnt see me shot down in
cold blood youre my friend threl-
len

 threllen said nothing he merely
looked at temple and reading that
look temple knew he had no chance

  ill sign he said slowly id have
more chance against a pair of rattlers
coulter spread the contents of the
envelope on a table

  blackmail muttered temple after
he had scratched his name on the bot-
tom of the pages and coulter had fold-
ed them up and replaced them in the
envelope

  blackmail yes coulter admitted
youll tell the court you signed under
duress of course but youre thinking
wrong there temple

  something about coulters tone made
temple turn pale

  you mean youre going to kill me
anyway he asked hoarsely

  its the safest way for us isnt it
said coulter youve always realized
it yourself dead men tell no tales
youve been getting up an army of
men to go over and wipe out the garys
and neils and mcwhirters youll be
glad to know thats going as you
planned it i brought some more men
to help and youll be in the saddle
here as far as anyone knows when its
over youll be found dead and people
will say it served you right while the
cross seven you hoped to own for
yourself will be owned by somebody
else theyll even say you killed your
girl cousin when shes found dead as
shes going to be youll be charged
with everything and meanwhile who
will take over the ranch who do you
think temple

 you said temple who else

 wrong it wont be me itll be
a smarter man than i am youre look-
ing at him temple

  temple looked at threllen and then
back at coulter then he stared hard
toward the doorway leading into the
dining room he stood as if transfixed
looking into the other room as if he
saw a ghost there

  d-dont let him do it he stam-
mered dont let him- the rest of
his words were drowned in the loud
crash of a rifle from beyond that door-
way fired by someone that jean could
not see temple went down all at
once his body collapsing to hit the
floor with a thump silence followed
until coulter chuckled

  dead center he said good shoot-
ing

 that mysterious murder the shot
fired through the doorway by some un-
known saved jean carvel from an out-
cry that would surely have betrayed
her an ordinary murder would have
brought a scream from her but this
sinister deliberate killing paralyzed
her her eyes were fixed on the rec-
canyons of the night



tangle of the doorway but no one ap-
peared in it

  only after a few moments was she
able to move at all then horror-struck
she hurried back to the window where
linda and nab were waiting in dark-
ness they helped her into the room
where she still trembled violently
then getting control of herself she
told them briefly what had happened

  threllen had come into the court
you heard that shot he called

  of course i heard it said nab
tartly it was like a cannon how
could i help but hear it

  ill tell you about it in the morn-
ing he said dont worry someone
just accidentally discharged a gun tell
you all about it in the morning he
added reassuringly

  they waited a few minutes then
slipping out of a back window they
left the house a light was shining in
hamlin stevens quarters through the
uncurtained windows they saw lindas
uncle sitting at a table which had an
array of bottles on it

  he shouldnt be left here said
linda at least we could give him
warning

  that hog muttered nab hes so
worthless that no one would trouble
to kill him hes too drunk to heed
any warning anyway

  they hurried on into a little orchard
above the ranch and went through it
before dropping into the main canyon
when they were clear of the house
jean carvel told them more in detail
what she had seen and heard the
threats of coulter and the shot from
the unseen assassin

  andy had the gray carvel team
hitched to the buckboard up canyon
roane and clayton gary used the
stretcher to carry the helpless tom
gary to the rig the saddle horses had
been brought there the three women
swung into the saddles and they start-
ed off clayton gary driving the rig
slowly with andy and roane acting
as guard one up ahead one at the back
there was always a chance of running

into some rider from the bunkhouse
came an occasional yell the men com-
ing out with coulter must have brought
out a supply of whiskey

  the buckboard wheels ground on the
rocky trail despite the slow pace gary
used in driving but they were far
enough away so the noise could not
be heard at the cross seven

  jeans heart lightened a little with
each rod of trail they covered reach-

hamilton stevens

ing the side canyon that climbed to the
rim gary pushed the team into a trot
on the easier grades their luck had
held so far but they guessed it had
deserted them when as they neared
the rim out of dusk canyon welled a
tremendous clatter of hoofs and loud-
pitched yells

  they stopped if their flight had not
been discovered the cavalcade might
continue along dusk canyon or if the
riders turned up the side canyon the
fugitives could push into the brush to
hide

  that hope died as the riders halted
at the forks of the trail matches flared
the rider group was looking for tracks
plainly they were following the buck-
board

  maybe the absence of the women at
the house had been noticed at any
rate the flight had been discovered


robert dale denver

and they were being pursued with
every available cross seven rider

chapter ix

barbed vire trap

t was a crazy wild flight
with the buckboard rattling
over the rocky trail as tom
garys father urged the
team to a lope the three
women-jean linda and
nab-were keeping close behind the
rig dusk canyon was a deep well of
shadow below but the moon shone full
on the trail making it into a road paved
with silver

  a road to death thought roane bran-
don as he and andy checked their
horses to drop behind the buckboard
steadily the hoofs of the small army
were hammering up the side canyon
until roane and andy could catch
fleeting glimpses of the horsemen

  some distance below the rim the two
calmly dismounted tied their horses
and then hurried back down the trail
to halt on a narrow ledge where the
road lay with a deep canyon on one
side and a cliff on the other

  the hoofs thudding nearer became
a rumble that resounded in the canyon
like the steady roll of thunder then
the leaders streaked around a bend and
came in full sight

  like shootin ducks off a pond
murmured andy partle crouching with
his rifle barrel resting on a boulder
just cant fire into em without givin
em a little warning except if i knowed
it was threllen and coulter headin
that parade or the feller thats bossin
all this wolf pack

  they sent one warning shot and the
men pulled up at once only to come
on again yelling savagely sending a
hot fire from their rifles one slug tore
fragments from the boulder behind
which andy partle was squatted andy
swore and at once opened fire roane
followed suit

two men plummeted from their sad-

dles that was enough to halt the
charge to send the riders scattering
into the brush along the trail for a
few minutes there was a confused
shouting below while the guns were
still more riders were coming up until
the side canyon seemed alive with men

  then the guns opened up almost at
once for a full minute pouring a hail
of shots up trail at the two that blocked
the way

  andy and roane sent a brisk fire in
return and the firing echoing and re-
echoing within the canyon walls made
a deafening uproar meanwhile men
were advancing afoot the moonlight
helped andy and roane enabling them
to make certain targets of two men
who foolishly exposed themselves
that stopped the advance and roane
took advantage of the lull to climb cat-
like up a cliff working his way along
it he stopped only when he was above
the vanguard of attackers when the
group moved forward again roanes
rifle opened up at a short range

  a man went down rolling out into
the trail clawing at his chest screech-
ing with pain bullets hammered
vengefully all about roane he was
forced to flatten out until the storm of
lead ended soon after he rejoined
andy

  coulter and threllen had learned a
lesson and cagily they sent men in a
wide circle that would take them be-
hind the stubborn pair that took time
and roane and andy used an old trick
stopping firing in the hope that the
men below would think that they had
retreated the ruse worked

  theyve gone git after em came
an order in a voice roane guessed to
be threllens git your horses and run
em down

  men mounted again to ride forward
but they did not get far the two rifles
opened up again and men flung them-
selves frantically from their saddles

  this time andy and roane did ac-
tually withdraw to their horses mount-
ing they rode quietly on up to the
rimrock to halt again
canyons of the night



  fearing that they would run into an-
other trap the group below was slow
to follow waiting for long minutes
before advancing warily as if they were
crossing a mined battlefield

  on the rim to roanes and andys
astonishment jean carvel met them

  that place where dad and i couldnt
get our wagon across she told them
rather incoherently we got the buck-
board over it carried tom gary across
and then dragged the buckboard with
the help of our saddle horses theyre
traveling on dont stay too long to
fight them here two of you cant hope
to hold them

  we done a good job of it so far
bragged andy partle you ride on
youngun bullets dont know if its a
girl or man theyre hittin git he
ordered sternly and keep poundin
along the trail fore long you ort to
be runnin into them garys headed over
this way to fetch tom

  the girl obeyed reluctantly riding
on while andy and roane followed at
a more leisurely pace with ears cocked
alertly for sounds along the back trail
they had traveled a mile or more be-
fore they heard the faint click of hoofs
behind them again andy partle lead-
ing the way set a faster pace on the
open mesa there was no chance of hold-
ing back even a dozen men but where
the road dipped into one of the big
canyons running into the night they
could make another stand the buck-
board they judged would need a lot
of time to climb up out of that canyon
and go across the mesa above dawn
canyon

  as he rode roane was thinking of
the trail ahead it would be a race to
reach clayton garys ranch but getting
there meant no safety coulter and
threllen had enough men to force a
way through the fence blocking the
gorge or failing that to make a wide
circle to drop in on the ranch wiping
out the defenders of the gary ranch
house they could ride on to the other
ranches in dawn and star canyons
staging a massacre at each place that

outfit of killers had to be stopped the
problem was how

  considering possible ways roane
thought of gary gorge that narrow
deep trench closed in by sheer rock
cliffs which a chipmunk could not
climb he had thought on his ride
through the gorge that it would make
a wonderful natural trap for wild
horses in a way this chase was like
many of the chases he had made to
capture bands of mustangs only in
this chase he was running with the
hunted chased by a wolf pack that
would tear them to pieces

  as the mesa began to dip toward the
canyon they heard a sudden clatter of
hoofs from horsemen ahead of them
andy partle checked his mount

  they sure aint circled and got
ahead of us he growled

  no you knothead returned roane
and spurred his horse its the garys
coming over for tom

  four riders emerged from the trees
and swept toward them only to turn to
ride along with the pair they could
not afford to stop the hammer of hoofs
was growing louder behind them of
the four riders two were jean carvel
and clayton gary dr will gary had
been in the rescue party and had taken
claytons place in the buckboard with
his nephew the other two riders were
toms brothers ed and lee

  they now had five men to hold back
pursuit but even five were too few to
hold back the little army long

  we can make it to the ranch all
right shouted clayton to roane rid-
ing alongside what happens after is
what worries me theres only eight
families of us living in dawn and star
a fifteen-year-old neil boy came along
with us to help fetch tom when we
met your rig we sent him hightailing
it ahead to get all the folks in the can-
yons to come to my ranch to meet this
gun outfit all we can do is to hole
up and fight em off until outside help
comes which will take a day or so if
any help comes at all

  maybe we can do better than hold


robert dale denver

em off roane returned ive trapped
more than a few bands of wild horses
in my life

  so have i returned clayton over
the drum of hoofs drove em into
natural corrals or pens we built but
whats trapping mustangs got to do
with this flock of buzzards

 just this explained roane
youve got a natural horse trap in that
gorge and with both ends of it closed
youd have a corral strong enough to
hold men youve got the lower end
of it closed by that fence at your ranch
if you had the upper end blocked this
coulter-threllen bunch would be
trapped the upper end is only a few
yards across and i noticed a pile of
barbed wire rolls there

  yeah we intended to make a fence
there to keep our horses from driftin
over on the cross seven range

  that same wire strung across the
gorge and helped by a few riflemen
could keep a big bunch of men penned
in you havent got enough men to
fight this bunch a battle on even terms
but i figure theres enough of us to
keep em penned in that gorge both
day and night as long as the moon is
as bright as it is now

  clayton gary silently chewed over
the proposition as they dropped into
the depths of the canyon he was still
considering it when they climbed out
they had gained on the buckboard
with linda and nab still riding close
behind it the rig would need time to
travel the steep trenches and switch-
backs by which the road descended
into dawn canyon and gary gorge it
was time to make another stand

  the four men with jean still stub-
bornly staying with them halted on
the canyon rim dismounting to take
cover once more the pursuing caval-
cade thudded up to meet a hail of
shots and to scatter before it and
again coulter and threllen sent men
in a circle on the rim the five fanned
out to meet this maneuver spreading
out to keep the circlers from getting
past them for fully ten minutes there

was a hot exchange of shots then the
men and jean carvel raced on

  it was only then that clayton gary
gave his judgment on roanes plan
that scheme of yours he said is
all right with both ends of the gorge
closed wed have a fair chance of hold-
ing em there a monkey couldnt climb
those walls theres just one break in
them that men could use to get up outa
there afoot but we can watch that
spot well try it ill stay behind with
my boys to put up that fence and build
us a barricade the upper stretch of
the gorge is as bare as an egg-no cover
at all for men to crawl along it

  better let me stay in your place
volunteered roane you know your
neighbors you go on and get them
organized to hold that fence thats
where these snake bloods will try hard-
est to break through

  gary nodded all right well hold
em below there ought to be five or
six men and older boys down there by
now with more coming

  near the upper end of the gorge they
met two of the gary neighbors men
from the mcwhirter family who had
come to help get tom gary back from
the cross seven these two volunteered
to stay with roane and lee and ed
gary to block the upper end of the
gorge

  jean and clayton gary rode on leav-
ing the five men who tied their horses
back of some huge boulders and waited
five minutes later the first of the cross
seven riders came by and then the
main body a flowing river of horsemen
in the moonlight pouring into the
shadows of the gorge walls the five
waited until the last straggling riders
had gone then they set to work hastily
unrolling the spools of wire fastening
the strands to trees and jagged pin-
nacles of rock erecting a barricade
with dangling loops of wire that made
a barbed tangle of metal snakes across
the head of the gorge

  then they built boulders into a wall
on a little shelf some twenty feet above
the gorge floor this was to serve as
canyons of the night



a barricade behind which riflemen
could crouch to cover the stretch be-
hind the wire trap

  by then at the other end of the short
gorge the firing had started hot and
heavy coulter and threllen were evi-
dently attacking the high fence below
the gary house

  roane was anticipating that threllen
and coulter would try their old tactics
if they met too strong opposition send
part of their force back through the
gorge to circle along the rims and
jump the gary ranch on a flank fif-
teen minutes later the thud of hoofs
sounded along the gorge and half a
dozen riders came in sight to race
unsuspectingly toward the wire barrier

 roane and the others behind the
stone barricade on the shelf held their
fire until the riders swept into a moon-
lit stretch when their rifles boomed
it was plain slaughter two men were
instantly dumped from their saddles
the rest frantically scurried back leav-
ing the fallen men where they lay

 it was plain that three men were
easily adequate to hold this end of the
gorge judging by the heavy firing
help might be needed at the other end
lee gary and roane left afoot climb-
ing to the rim of the gorge and travel-
ing along it until they were above the
gary ranch the guns were still mak-
ing a harsh bellowing bedlam of sound
below so far at least the attackers had
been unable to penetrate the high fence
across the gorge

  roanes black-and-tan hound which
he had left at the gary ranch when he
had taken dan carvel there came from
the ranch house to greet his master
with his usual single deep bark stop-
ping at the house roane found jean
nab and two neighbor women of the
garys preparing a hot meal for the
fighters

 dan carvel was in bed demanding
querulously that broken leg or no
broken leg he be carried to a place
where he could help in the battle tom
gary was in another room with linda
stevens attending him

  there was no time to stop at the
house however the guns were raising
a fresh uproar below roane hurried
down to join in the defense of the
ranch

chapter x

battle of gary gorge

            oane found andy
    i	parte clayton gary

              and two neighbors
jmw	firing from behind a

             wa stones loop-
holed for their rifles
and looking down on the high wire
fence in the gorge bottom other rifle-
men were located behind barricades on
the slope

  the moon and stars were fading fast
before the slowly approaching day and
as roane arrived the threllen-coulter
men were making use of the faint light
to try an advance it was a cautious
one however with men keeping under
close cover as they moved forward in
an attempt to reach the fence fully
half of the force stayed behind to hail
shots at the rifle barricades on the
slope coolly calmly deliberately the
garys and their neighbors fired when-
ever a target presented itself before
that slow deadly shooting the advance
was stopped cold

  coulter and threllen withdrew their
men to some boulders in the gorge bot-
tom and the guns fell silent

  we got a bear by the tail remarked
andy partle as he reloaded his rifle
its like having a bunch of hornets
in your back pocket as long as you
keep em buttoned tight in there youre
safe

  clayton gary nodded well keep
em there besides the two ends of that
gorge theres only one way of getting
out-by a sort of chimney worn by
flood water they may find that chim-
ney when it comes full day and crawl
up it well have to be waiting for em

  he grinned at roane suddenly your
mantraps worked fine so far lee just


robert dale denver

told me you didnt have much trouble
at the other end

  roane chuckled grimly no it was
the other bunch that had all the trou-
ble

  dr will gary a cigar stuck jauntily
in his mouth and lugging a long-bar-
reled rifle crawled over to join them
enough men down there to burn us
all out if they ever get loose he re-
marked i just cant believe what im
seeing and hearing jean carvel says
they killed fred temple intending to
put the blame for this whole ruckus on
him and she said coulter admitted
he wasnt boss of all this that the boss
was the man that shot temple from
that room only jean didnt see who
he was who he could be is something
i cant figure out

  as full day came the shots again
began buzzing up angrily then they
suddenly stopped and a man after wav-
ing a rag that might be called white
showed himself coming closer the
flag bearer was revealed as gid coulter
he marched up to the fence and halted

  clayton gary showed himself on the
slope what you wantin he called

  well give you one chance to get
out of this with your lives called
coulter quit now and well let you
have a week to take your families and
your stock out of these canyons you
cant lick us you cant hold us down
here well find a way out

  coulter said clayton astounded
by the mans brass on top of all else
youre a fool this country wont stand
for a massacre by a red man or white
you can try to blame this on temple
but we know temple is dead and you
and threllen and every one of your
bunch will pay for this

  try to collect that pay snarled
coulter nobody is going to do any-
thing to any of us this will go down
as just a neighborhood quarrel are
you quitting or not its your last
chance

  get out of my sight raged gary
before i lose control of my trigger
finger well hunt the highest tree in

the country to hang you from along
with threllen and whoever is the big
boss of your gang

  coulter retreated and the guns start-
ed up again in a renewed fury some
of the attackers were going along the
cliff walls hunting for a way of escape
while the garys and their neighbors
trailed them along the rim of the gorge
angling down shots whenever they saw
targets one man succeeded in climb-
ing to a ledge that seemed to promise
a route to the rim lee gary discovered
him and fired a wild shot the man
however was scared and losing his
hold fell some thirty feet to land in
a crumpled heap

  the sun began to shine down with
an increasing warmth that gave prom-
ise of an oven heat later in the day
reluctantly the cross seven riders
were forced to realize that they were
in a jam caught in a rock-girt pen
whose two gateways were defended by
stubborn riflemen there was no hope
of successfully attacking those block-
ing fences in daylight their best
chance was in waiting until night hop-
ing that a mountain storm might come
up bringing a darkness that would en-
able them to cut through one of the
fences but coulter and threllen evi-
dently werent willing to wait they
seemed possessed by the fierce desire
of all trapped animals for freedom
there must be some other way out and
with a cautious regard for the watch-
ing rifles they continued to search
for it not overlooking any possible out
for them

  it was half an hour before one of
the group discovered the chimney-like
crack in a cliff wall clmbing it the
man came to a water trough channeled
in the rock and angling steeply up-
ward unaware that eyes were watch-
ing from above he returned jubilantly
to report his discovery shortly after-
ward some ten men began crawling up
the chimney with rifles fastened to
their backs below the remainder of
the threllen-coulter force had opened
up a hot fire keeping their guns boom-
canyons of the night



ing to cover the escape of part of their
crew

  a hard climb brought the ten led
personally by threllen and coulter to
the bottom of a shallow well of rock
just below the rim the sides of this
well were some twenty feet high but
slanted so that an acrobatic man could
scramble up it and assist the others to
join him

 as they rested for a few minutes
from the climb a pebble fell from the
lip of the well and clattered at their
feet the men all glanced up nervously

  we could have made that a fifty-
pound boulder called down roane
who had been given command of the
party of six men that had been waiting
patiently you fellows can climb on
up but leave your guns behind you
you wont need them any more

  george threllen stared up hard at
the screen of cedars that grew on the
lip of the well trying to pierce the
particular curtain from which the voice
had sounded

  youre the fellow that was camped
below the ranch he said accusingly
damn those four that let you and your
partner get away if id only shot you
down when we had you surrounded in
your camp wed have dodged all this
trouble

  all thats water passed under the
bridge roane returned are you
quittin threllen or not were sure
not letting you go back make up your
mind and do it quick your outfit is too
dangerous to play around with

  threllen stepped close to coulter and
muttered something to him when
coulter shook his head threllen
cursed him threllen had a certain bull-
headed bravery about him and just
now a blind unreasoning rage

  go to hell he bawled as answer
to the invitation to surrender and
swung up his rifle to begin pulling the
trigger shooting blindly at the cedar
screen the first shot threw the rest
of the men into confusion most of
them jumped away as far as possible
from threllen pressing their bodies

against the sides of the deep cup in
which they had been trapped as they
jumped they yelled that they quit
coulter and one other man turned to
try to slip back down the way they
had come hoping to escape

  from above the guns boomed a heavy
echo to threllens shots threllen went
down trying vainly to keep his big
legs under him even lying on the
rocky floor he tried to raise his rifle
to his shoulder to fire a last shot but
that effort was too great for him a
slug sent by lee gary had smashed
through threllens chest

 the man who had attempted to es-
cape with coulter had been ahead of
the saloonman-gambler taking a des-
perate chance he half leaped half slid
down a small cliff missed by the bul-
lets raining from above coulter fol-
lowing him frantically was not so
lucky a rifle shot caught him in the
back sent him sprawling

  with that the battle was over almost
as soon as it had begun

  the rest of the men in the rock cup
with their rifles dropped were still
screeching that they quit and keeping
their hands raised high as proof that
they meant what they yelled

  they were ordered to climb from the
hole leaving threllen and coulter
roane and andy partle descended to
look at the pair andy turned threllen
over with a foot for an examination

  dead as a petrified injun maid he
announced and im hopin the same
for mister coulter

  andy was doomed to disappointment
on that point coulter was still alive
but able to do no more than glare up
at andy

  likely to have to waste a lot o
good whiskey and grub tryin to keep
him alive until they kin hang him
andy said sourly

  lariats had been brought and one of
them now was used to lift coulter from
the hole then with two of the other
prisoners carrying the wounded coul-
ter roane and andy started back to-
ward the gary ranch threading a


robert dale denver

course above the cliffs lee gary was
left to guard against any attempt at
further escape by way of the water
course

  when the party reached the ranch
they found that the guns of the men
trapped in the gorge were still the
one man who had slid back safely had
returned to his companions to tell them
of the disaster that had met coulter
threllen and the others everything
had been staked on the hope that the
threllen-coulter group would be able
to surprise the ranchers from the rear
with that hope gone and their two
leaders missing they had no resistance
left

  hungry and disheartened they asked
for a parley a little later they marched
out with their hands up they were
herded with the other prisoners into
a little natural rock pen where they
were given food and held under guard

  by this time nearly the whole popu-
lation of dawn and star canyons had
arrived at the gary ranch a few men
argued hotly for a wholesale hanging
of the cross seven gunmen but cooler
counsel prevailed some of the men
working for the cross seven might
have been persuaded that they were
fighting on the righteous side of a
range war their punishment was for
the courts to decide as for two of the
ringleaders threllen was dead and dr
gary gave coulter but a few hours to
live

  a committee of three men was chosen
to ride to hurley to notify not only
the sheriff a close coulter friend but
in addition a score of leading citizens
who would be asked to come out to
thresh over the battle of gary gorge
and the events leading up to it

  meanwhile the ranchers of dawn and
star canyons were quietly jubilant
they had lost no men in the battle in
the gorge young tom gary for the
first time since he had been carried to
jean carvels camp was pronounced
out of danger by his uncle dan car-
vels broken leg needed only time to
mend

  roane brandon and andy partle had
headed for the kitchen with the satis-
faction that the job which had brought
them to help linda stevens was done
she had escaped the dangers which
nab had rightly feared threatened the
girl

 the kitchen was crowded with
strange women which was all right
with andy partle he barged right up
to the stove grabbing an empty plate
on the way roane however hesitated
in the doorway and jean carvel know-
ing what he had come for filled a plate
with the old ranch standbys beef and
beans and brought it to him then
while he ate on a bench outdoors she
sat beside him

  all over he remarked cheerfully
and they raise mighty good-tasting
beef in this country raise almost as
good cattle i guess as they do horses

  cant you forget horses jean said
teasingly

  he put down his plate and laid his
hand on hers its a good idea to try
to forget things like those that hap-
pened last night jean id rather re-
member the campfires i saw in here
and seeing you by their light id like
to see you beside a lot of campfires in
these canyons jean whats happened
in here was horrible but it wasnt the
fault of the canyons-just the wrong
sort of people i like this country id
like to stay in it clayton gary and the
doctor have talked to me about taking
over the job of gathering their horses
and selling them

  ive got a better job for you that
that linda told me that shed like to
have you take over the job of running
the cross seven you and tom gary
lindas certain now that her father
was never insane and shes not afraid
to marry tom

 it could be worked out-to work
for the cross seven i guess admitted
roane im kind of thinking that my
partner will want to be over here near
nab we could sell our ranch for
enough to buy an interest in the cross
seven but id do that only if you
canyons of the night



stayed here too with me will you

jean

  ill stay wherever you are she said
simply but roane theres something
that still bothers me the rest seem
to have forgotten it but we still dont
know who shot fred temple through
that doorway we dont know who en-
gineered all this working through
coulter and threllen she went on
impetuously some man planned to
have linda killed and no one knows
who he is he might still be making
plans

  youre right on that he agreed
soberly doc gary has been trying to
get it out of coulter but so far its
no go

  he turned to look at the door of the
leanto where the wounded coulter had
been taken the door opened suddenly
and dr gary stepped out his face
was flushed with anger as he turned
toward the open doorway

   its the least that you could do to
make up a little for all the hell you
fellows caused in here he shouted
well find out sooner or later who was
behind all this you might as well tell
us now who was it that shot fred
temple

  i shot him said coulter promptly
from the bed where he lay it was a
pleasure to see him kick and there
wasnt nobody running this show ex-
cept me and threllen we was only
using temple cashing in on the dirty
scheme he had in his head-getting
addison stevens killed and starting a
range war in here me and threllen
wed have got the ranch through the
loan i had made the cross seven it
would have been easy with linda and
that drunk fool of a hamlin dead id
have hated to kill hamlin though hes
the best drinking customer i ever had
hamlin was

  hamlin was what croaked some-
one behind jean and roane they both
turned

  hamlin stevens was sitting on a sor-
rel horse ten feet from them he was
clad in a leather jacket old wool shirt

  soiled corduroy breeches and a pair of
badly scuffed english riding boots
the frog-like eyes in his sharp-fea-
tured face seem to bulge out further
than ever

  he chuckled as the doctor stared at
him astonished whats been going
on over here doc he called

  a worse nightmare than you ever
had after your sprees the doctor re-
sponded shortly you can count your-
self lucky youre still alive hamlin
they were about to wipe out your
whole family-to get the cross seven
you probably know that fred temple
was killed last night or dont you

  hamlin shrugged the china cook
told me he said and not much loss
if we had been wiped out these can-
yons of the night have been bad luck
for all of us stevenses

  beside roane jean drew in a sharp
breath and her fingers were suddenly
digging hard into his arm as she half
arose roane looking up was aston-
ished to find her pretty face drawn and
pale her dark eyes staring wide at the
rider on the sorrel

  why whats the matter jean
he asked

  there she exclaimed in a half-
strangled voice there she lifted
her hand and pointed at hamlin
stevens he is the one that killed
fred temple he was the man that
shot temple through the doorway

  both roane and dr will gary stared
bewilderedly at the girl

  you dont believe me but i say he
killed fred temple i know it i just
feel it she went on almost hysteri-
cally he was the one that would have
gotten the cross seven with his rela-
tives all dead he may be insane but
he was smart enough to plan all this
and hell still go on killing and plan-
ning

  dr gary shook his head no he
said youre mistaken jean why
hamlin he- his voice trailed off as
he looked at the rider of the sorrel
the bugged eyes of the man were star-
ing with a horrible fixity at the girl


robert dale denver

and with a light that never shone from
a sane persons eyes

  then a chuckle came from stevens
shes right doc he said in an
amused voice shes guessed it shes
a smart girl-too smart

  again stevens chuckled and look
out shouted dr gary hes got a
gun

  jean carvel knew that whether ham-
lin stevens was insane or not she faced
death from the ugly snout of the six-
shooter that came up from under the
leather jacket and swung slowly toward
her frozen she stood and then a hand
and arm were pushing her back over
the bench and roane was springing
in front of her jean could not have
lifted a finger to save herself but she
screamed now realizing that roane
was taking the bullet intended for her
the bellow of the gun was like the
crack of doom in her ears then des-
perately she was scrambling to her feet

  the sorrel horse was jumping about
under stevens who was trying to level
the still smoking gun to fire again as
roane unarmed was running toward
the man straight into the next bullet
that would come from the gun

  but before that shot could be fired
a rifle which sounded like a cannon ex-
ploded from the direction of the kit-
chen hamlin stevens blood flowing
from his temple toppled from his sad-
dle to fall a shapeless lump on the
ground jean looked back and saw old
andy partle by the kitchen doorway
holding a long-barreled rifle from

which powder smoke curled out lazily

  andy looked at the fallen figure of
the man to make sure that he did not
need another shot and then felt of his
shoulder

 by dang roanes partner com-
plained this old blunderbuss has got
the wust kick of anything i ever pulled
trigger on ort to be a law agin
weapons like this here

  jean was looking unbelievingly at
roane who had turned toward her
plainly he was unhurt she ran to him
shakily

 how did he ever miss you she
asked still unable to believe the mir-
acle he wasnt ten feet away when he
shot

 why honey he told her as his
arms folded about her that was plumb
simple i just shied my empty plate
at his horses head and the sorrel nag
jumped so far hamlin couldnt have
hit the side of a barn if hed been shoot-
ing from inside it

  he might have killed you sobbed
jean

  look he went on gently i told
you what has happened in here well
forget its looking ahead that well
be doing from now on-to all the camp-
fires well have under the stars and
to that big log house with twenty or
thirty rooms im going to build for
you in one of these canyons of the
river night

  she smiled then her dark eyes shin-
ing yes roane well look ahead
she promised

	when a nazi or a jappy

starts to shoot across the pond

you can lick him dead as doornails
if youve bought your wartime bond

ghost town
lady

the judge never could abide a weepy woman and so old mrs gray kept
herself so busy helping out young folks she didnt have time to mourn

by eric
howard

here was no one living
in chaco any more but old
mrs gray her husband
judge gray had died a
year ago he had started
the town and he had al-
ways been loyal to it believing that it
would come back no one except mrs
gray shared that belief all of the
houses in the town had long since gone
to pieces but the gray house largest
and best was still in good repair it
clung to the side of the canyon wall
above the old street and mrs gray
spent many sunny hours on the big
porch

she was small and frail she weighed
not more than a hundred pounds but



she claimed she was as tough as nails
she kept the old house spic and span
she took great pride in her garden and
her chickens once a month or so
someone from the railroad town of
butte city visited her the doctor
perhaps or parson hardy

  always they urged her to move down
to butte city then she laughed at
them and there was something youth-
ful and musical about her laughter in-
variably she would feed her guests
fried chicken biscuits and rich gravy
cooked as only she could cook them

  she had learned to cook she said be-
cause the judge was a man who liked
good vittles she had spent her whole
life in pleasing the judge and now


eric howard

that he was gone she was loyal to his
memory and his town he was buried
on a high hill above chaco

  this morning having fed her chick-
ens and watered her garden and swept
her house the old lady sat down in a
hand-made rocker on the porch never
idle she picked up some fancy work
gazing far off across the tawny desert
as it stretched toward butte city she
saw a faint cloud of dust

  monday-and company cornin she
murmured thats strange id better
pick a mess of butter beans and dress
a fryer or two no tellin who it might
be could be one of the syndicate men
judge come to buy the mine she
laughed quietly but we wont sell
not us chacos our town and well
hang on

  she reached for a pair of field-glasses
and held them to her blue eyes

  bless my heart she said its a
lady wonder who it can be none of
the ladies in butte like to ride any
more all soft and fat and lazy the way
town folks get well whoever it is
shell be here inside an hour id best
get busy

  she hummed as she worked she had
discovered long ago during her first
years of loneliness on the desert that
if one didnt stay happy one would be
miserable that was her philosophy
and it worked well

  if you have to scrub a floor she
often said youd better sing at it
she was again sitting composed and
serene on the wide porch with her
food all ready for the stove when the
rider came up the trail through her
field-glasses she saw that her visitor
was young and slender the girl paused
now and then to look over the deserted
ghost town

  when she was dismounting just be-
low mrs gray went to the porch rail
and called down good mornin to
you

  the girl looked up and smiled oh
good morning youre mrs gray
arent you

 nobody else take your horse

around back put him in the corral
ill be out there in a jiffy

 thank you

  mrs gray liked the girls looks it
was nice to have a visitor like her for
a change someone young and happy-
looking

  mighty sweet face she murmured
pretty auburn hair framin it mighty
near the color of her sorrel looks
capable too and not foolish like some
i can think of

  she hurried through the house and
out the back door the girl had led
her horse into the corral and was now
unsaddling

  its been a hot trip she said smil-
ing at the old lady

  come on out on the porch and get
cool theres water there and some hay
your horsell be all right

  the girl followed her through the
house to the porch looking at the old
furniture mrs gray urged her to sit
down and she herself took up her
needlework she waited quietly for her
visitor to speak

  im mary grant the girl said and
ive come all the way from my uncles
ranch up near denver

 mrs gray nodded the judge and
i visited denver a few times a pretty
city we stopped at a grand hotel and
we had a wonderful time the judge
bought me a dozen silk dresses and we
went to dances and theaters she
laughed to herself the judge was my
husband mary the folks here made
him judge when chaco was a big town
they told me in butte city that you
live here all alone

  yes i do bless me if i know why
anybody would live in butte when they
might live in chaco its my town and
i like it

  the girl frowned i came here to
meet jerry lansing she said i
couldnt believe what they told me in
butte city because you see jerry
wrote me that he was here-that hed
be waiting for me here they said they
hadnt heard of him that there was no
one around here by that name
ghost town lady



  jerry lansing no i cant place
him there was a lansing here years
ago tom his name was i remember
him a big quiet man the judge
liked him i recall

  i dont understand it the girl said
she drew an envelope from the pocket
in her blouse and took out a letter she
read it he says as plain as anything
that i should be here the th he even
told me where to hire a horse in butte
city to ride out here he says he final-
ly struck it rich and that well be
married and go on south to the ranch
he wants to buy

  mrs gray sensed her worry well
she said quietly the th is tomorrow
this mr lansing may turn up by then
have you known him long

  oh yes for years but i havent
seen him for nearly four years i havent
heard from him very often but-well
we always planned to be married so-
well when this letter came i just
skipped and now-

  come on into the kitchen with me
mrs gray suggested i was just goin
to fix dinner

 i cant understand why no one
seems to know jerry or why he wanted
me to meet him here instead of butte
city he didnt tell me chaco was a
ghost town

  it isnt mrs gray said crisply
not while im here

 she put the girl to work in the
kitchen to take her mind off jerry
lansing she herself whipped up a
batch of biscuits floured the chicken
and set the butter beans on to cook
as she worked she spoke cheerfully of
her garden and her happiness in chaco
while the chicken was browning in the
big skillet she heard a horse outside
and went out on the back porch

ell tommy
barnes she called
out happily
youre just in time
come in

 deputy sheriff
tom barnes swung down from the sad-

dle and walked toward her spurs
jingling he swept off his big hat and
smiled at her

  youve got company he asked
glancing at marys horse

  yes a young lady from denver she
was in butte yesterday rode out this
mornin so wash your face and slick
your hair down tommy get a hustle
on

  she spoke to him as if he were still
the ten-year-old chaco orphan who had
run errands for the judge tommy was
used to that

  i havent been in butte for a week
he said trailin a feller he got away
from me

  then youll be ready for something
good to eat who was he tommy
goes by the name of jud lane
robbed a bank down below i was right
close to him the son of a gun just
melted away i cant understand it
im ashamed of you the judge
taught you to track anything on feet
well hurry up the tables set

 tom barnes washed up outside
combed his dark hair and then walked
into the kitchen mary grant was stand-
ing at one side neatly slicing tomatoes
from mrs grays garden it wasnt
strange that tom saw her first the
light from the window fell upon her
hair and made it golden tom looked
at her for a long moment scarcely
hearing mrs grays introduction

  oh if youre a deputy sheriff
mary said youve probably heard of
jerry lansing maybe you know him
he wrote me once that he had been
helping the sheriff

  no tom shook his head i cant
say ive heard of him

  well its the strangest thing
mary declared all his letters lately
have been mailed from butte city yet
nobody knows him

  lot of prospectors up in the hills
tom explained might be one of
them

  of course mrs gray agreed
hell show up tomorrow mary eat
hearty folks


eric howard

 early in the afternoon tom an-
nounced that he would have to be
getting on

back to butte mrs gray asked
i reckon-if i dont pick up the
trail again well good-by if this
gent doesnt show up miss send me
word ill look for him

  mary smiled at him oh im sure
hell be here jerry wouldnt disap-
point me were going to be married
you know

  tom rode off and mrs gray spent
most of the afternoon talking about
him-what a fine boy he was what the
judge had thought of him how he had
lost his parents when he was just a lad
and how he had worked and proved
himself

  mrs gray retired early after a light
supper after showing mary to an old-
fashioned room mary was sitting be-
fore a long mirror with a lamp on her
right brushing her hair when she
heard a faint tapping on the window
the sound startled her and she dropped
the brush

 sh someone whispered dont
wake the old lady its me-jerry
turn that lamp down

 trembling mary obeyed jerrys
voice sounded strange deep and harsh
but after dimming the light she moved
close to the window

  jerry she whispered

  hello sweetheart he said i saw
you when you rode up here but i didnt
want the old lady to know i was
around then that deputy sheriff-
how are you mary

  i-im fine jerry the girl said
uncertainly but-but why doesnt
anyone know you why didnt you
want mrs gray to see you i dont
understand

  i can explain all that i told you i
struck it rich well when that hap-
pens in this country a man has to keep
it secret now listen you stay here
all day tomorrow just before sundown
you tell the old lady you want to take
a little ride you ride down the hill
till you come to the old silver queen

mine-theres a big old sign on a build-
in there ill meet you there and well

  where jerry

  on south-to the ranch i wrote
you about

  but arent we going to be married
in butte city why didnt you meet

shes sharp well be married on the
way south youll be crazy about this

down

  all right jerry she whispered
another thing-dont call me jerry
ive had to use another name so they
wouldnt get wise to what ive been do-
ing if they knew i was lansing theyd
know what i was after call me jud
mary jud lane

  jud lane mary gasped her hand
against her lips

  yeah good night see you tomor-
row

  before she could speak he had
drifted into the darkness crouching
near the window the girl stared out in-
to the night jud lane-that was the
name of the man tom barnes was hunt-
ing he said he had robbed a bank

or a long time mary was
motionless hopeful of a
new life with jerry whom
she remembered as a gay
and handsome and daring
boy she had burned her
bridges she couldnt return to her
harsh stern uncle with whom she had
lived but she was afraid of the future
almost afraid of jerry he had changed
even his voice had changed if what
tom barnes said was true he had
changed beyond all belief

  she heard a deep sigh from mrs
gray in an adjoining room she list-
ened but the old lady seemed to be
asleep quietly mary prepared for bed
she lay perfectly still looking out into
ghost town lady



the night she couldnt sleep if jerry
lansing had become jud lane bank
robber she knew that all her romantic
dreams of escape into a new life were
ended and yet she told herself she
owed it to jerry to give him a chance to
explain perhaps tom barnes was mis-
taken tomorrow she would meet jer-
ry as he requested and she would lis-
ten to him then she would know
what she must do

  mrs gray greeted her in the morn-
ing with a bright smile and a happy
word mary looked tired and pale but
it was impossible to be discouraged in
mrs grays presence the little old
lady boasted of the size and freshness
of her eggs and cooked more of them
than mary could eat after breakfast
she stacked the dishes took the girl
with her into the garden she talked a
good deal about tommy barnes when
mary became pensive mrs gray put
her arm around her and said now
dont worry honey if this beau of
yours isnt here today hell likely show
up tomorrow youre welcome to stay
with me just as long as you like i en-
joy havin you here

  thank you but im sure jerry will
be here today

 tommy might show up too he
never gives up tommy dont hell
likely catch that man hes after might
stop in with his prisner

  mary trembled and looked down the
hill somewhere down there jerry
lansing-jud lane-was hiding not
wishing to be seen by mrs gray or the
deputy sheriff

  but the day passed swiftly and pleas-
antly in spite of her disturbing
thoughts mary caught herself laugh-
ing at things mrs gray said she real-
ized why it was that the old lady could
live here in chaco all alone she never
let herself be bored she was tireless
and energetic she seemed to think of
herself as very young

  late in the afternoon mary said hesi-
tantly i guess jerry isnt coming to-
day i-id like to ride down the hill
and look over the old camp

  she felt that she was being dishonest
especially when mrs gray peered at
her through her steel-rimmed specta-
cles

  go ahead child if you want to
she said and when you look around
try to picture the town as it was-when
it was boomin ah it was some place
then

  she watched mary ride off down the
slope

  ah the poor chick she murmured
off to meet that worthless bank-rob-
bin jud lane jerry lansing that was
its hard to say mebbe he was some ac-
count four years ago when last she saw
him the desert makes or breaks a man
the judge always said wonder if he
could be any kin to tom lansing
doubt it though tom lansing was a
square man

 well the poor girl dont know
which way to turn i could tell
that last night listening to em talk
i guess they dont know a person my
age dont sleep much just rests and
dreams he said i was sharp-seemed
kind of afraid of me well old lady
up and at em tommy must a gone
on to butte or hed a seen your signal
the old flag flyin i dont see how
tommy missed this jud lane though
id best be goin down there no tellin
what lies hell hand out

  hastily she caught up a sunbonnet
knotted the strings under her firm chin
she was wearing an apron she left
it on and when she took a gun from a
wall rack she thrust it under her apron

  then lifting her skirt she hurried
down a steep trail she said of herself
that she was as sure-footed as a goat
and she ran like a girl down the slope

 pausing near a tumble-down shack
that had once been a mine office she
looked ahead marys horse was there
near the old sliver queen buildings
the girl and jud lane were not in
sight

  mrs gray advanced cautiously her
head a little on one side now and then
she halted to listen

  ah she said


eric howard

  it was not that she had heard any-
thing but she saw now where jud
lane must have found a hide-out where
he had disappeared when tommy
barnes was trailing him there was a
mound of slag ahead the ground was
covered with it a horse would leave
no tracks there over on one side
against the bare hill there was a tun-
neled opening a heavy door led into it

  she knew that inside down a dark
passage there was a large timbered
circular room a man could hide there
could keep his horse inside could even
build a fire without being detected
the smoke would slowly drift upward
through cracks and crevices disappear-
ing before it reached the open

 mrs gray advanced to the heavy
door it had been padlocked and
chained but the lock had been broken
off it was open a few inches she put
her shoulder against it and slipped into
the dark tunnel closing the door be-
hind her

  she heard the mans voice then it
was low harsh argumentative

told you that mary my
uncle tom lansing was
here long ago gave my
father a map before he died
it showed where he cached
this gold when a bunch of
cutthroats tried to rob him my father
always planned to come here never got
to it i had to go about it secret cause
this property still belongs to the silver
queen mine company but the gold is
mine heired from uncle tom thats
why i took this other name moved in
secret these lawmen would claim i
was stealin from the mine company
if    come on girl you know me
well enough to trust me its gettin
dark well ride south

  mary grant was silent for a moment
then she spoke with an effort as
though it pained her

 is that the truth jerry-jud
youve taken nothing but this gold
your uncle-

  of course its the truth he de-

clared whats the matter with you
your wrote me how things were up
there with your uncle and i sent for
you you oughta show a little grati-
tude come on its time to leave
wait jerry please just one thing
more the deputy sheriff tom barnes
was looking for you for jud lane he
said you had robbed a bank why
should he say that jerry if-if you
didnt

  barnes you takin his word against
mine why would i rob a bank that
feller barnes is just another crooked
lawman workin for the mine compny
and other big outfits those fellers are
always down on poor men railroadin
em to jail and kickin em around
thats why i had a friend of mine pick
up my mail in butte i didnt want to
run into that crowd

 but you wrote me that you had
helped the sheriff mary quietly re-
minded him you said-

  weve got an all-night ride ahead
of us girl he cut in weve got to
get started you trust me dont you
you were eager enough to get away
from that stingy old uncle o yours
theres no time to chew the rag now
the girl spoke slowly i dont
know she said i think ive made a
mistake im not going jerry i-i
just cant

  he seized her shoulders roughly she
gasped

  youre goin all right he mut-
tered

  there was another sound in the cav-
ern-like room mrs gray standing in
the tunnel stiffened the sound was
that of a man groaning as he twisted
and writhed on the floor

 whats that mary cried
who-

 jerry lansing swore under his
breath never mind that he snapped
you stand right here im gettin my
horse

  but the girl ran to the side of the
room

 ifs a man roped and tied what
have you done jerry its-its the
ghost town lady



deputy sheriff tom barnes oh
jerry

 get away from him he got what
he had cornin sneakin in here work-
in for the mine compny tryin to stop
me from gettin what belongs to me
the next time i hit him ill cave his
skull in

 he caught mary by the arm and
pulled her away from the man on the
floor

  the girl sobbed and said oh jerry
what has happened to you

  he didnt bother to answer that mrs
gray slipped into the room swiftly
moved along the wall she knelt beside
tom barnes she found a knife in his
pocket and cut the ropes that bound
him she put her hands on his head
close to him she whispered tommy
tommy you must-

  sh he warned her thanks ill
take him now heres some matches
wood over there get a fire goin so
ill have some light on him

 careful tommy hes armed and
dangerous

 the deputy pulled his knees up
shook his head he slowly got to his
feet across the room mary was sob-
bing almost inaudibly jerry lansing
was putting a bridle on his horse

  tom barnes moved across the floor
he heard the girl gasp as she saw him
then he leaped he got his left arm
around the other mans neck his right
hand closed on lansings wrist he
bent him over backwards lansing
choked and muttered then to free him-
self from toms hold dropped to the
floor but the deputy sheriff clung to
him and they rolled over and over
fighting hard

  mrs gray pulled dry bark from ce-
dar wood and applied a match a flick-
ering flame played over the damp walls
of the timbered room

take him tommy boy she urged
mrs gray mary gasped you-
come over here honey the old
lady said i heard a lot of what he
told you and if i ever heard a man
lyin hes it that story of his is plain

fishy if he struck it rich tom said
how-by robbin a bank leave him
to tommy

  but tom barnes wasnt proving ade-
quate to the task of subduing lansing
the latter outweighted him by some
twenty pounds toms head ached from
the gun-clubbing he had received his
whole body seemed stiff and awkward
refusing to obey his will lansings
powerful arms and superior weight
were too much for him

  knowing that he must break the
clinch and get room to strike at lans-
ing he exerted his full strength and
broke away in a stand-up fight his skill
and quickness would serve him well
he leaped back from lansing as the
latter jumped up then tom charged
striking out with left and right

  lansing did not meet his rush in-
stead he retreated mrs gray had
added light wood to the small fire now
the whole room was illumined bright-
ly-

  lansing backed against the wall
crouching his hand darted down to his
side his face dark and bitter was
twisted into a mask of rage his gun
cleared leather

  goin to kill you this time he
muttered

  no no jerry mary cried

  she started toward him but a gun
spoke before she had taken more than
one step lansings arm extended as
he aimed at tom barnes dropped to
his side the gun fell from his fingers
he stared across the firelit circle and
saw mrs gray then he looked down
at his bleeding arm

  you- he muttered

  me said mrs gray with satisfac-
tion youre not the first man ive
had to shoot but i declare i havent
felt so much like killin one for years
the judge always said-

 tom barnes suddenly lunged a
well aimed left an uppercut clipped
lansing on the chin he dropped the
deputy sheriff knelt beside him got out
handcuffs and snapped them on his
wrists then he rolled up lansings

sleeve and bound the wound with a
clean handkerchief

  i was wanderin around tryin to
pick up his trail tom said when i
saw your flag i come back here and
tried to figger things out finally added
two and two when i saw the lock busted
off the door here he must a heard
me he was waitin in the tunnel and
he clubbed me down well lady as the
judge used to say youre dynamite
when you get riled

  mrs gray laughed had to be in
my time she said wheres your
horse tom i didnt see it outside
anywhere

  he likely put it in a shed or some-
where after layin me out

  well lets get out of this hole the
old lady said briskly she crossed over
to mary and put her arm across the
girls shoulders come child youve
just got to get used to the idea that
men change here on the desert can
you manage him tom

 sure tom said you go on
ahead

ary was crying
softly as they went
out through the dark
tunnel into the twi-
light mrs gray
left her there for a
moment and crossed over to a nearby
shed she flung the door open toms
horse still saddled and bridled was
there she led the horse out and told
mary to mount her own

  go on up home honey she said
gently well be along put the ket-
tle on tom will need some strong
coffee-and i could use some too
tom led lansings horse out of the
tunnel lansing was lying across the
saddle tom was carying a pair of
saddle bags

  bank moneys in here he said
that story about his uncles cache of
gold-i reckon he just made that up
i think so tommy he had to have
some explanation of how he struck it
rich for mary he knew that a fine

sweet girl like mary wouldnt stand for
crookedness she is a fine girl tom-
my im goin to keep her with me
shes had a hard time of it livin with
an uncle that didnt want her dream-
ing of this man as he was when he was
a boy im going to tell her im gettin
old and need her here you back me
up on that tommy

  i sure will tom barnes said and
grinned id hate to see her leave the
country were kind of short of pretty
girls around here

  mrs gray chuckled it was high
time she thought that tommy began
to pay attention to pretty girls

  tom led lansings horse up to mrs
grays house she followed leading
his they put the animals in the corral
and tom lifted lansing from the sadle
he was able to stand now but all the
fight had gone out of him mrs gray
stood before him while tom unsaddled
and fed the horses she looked steadily
at lansing

  he gave her a surlv insolent stare
she slowly shook her head

  its too bad she said i can see
the kind of boy you must a been un-
ruly and ambitious wanting to get what
you wanted no matter how not strong
enough to stick to the slow hard way
too bad tom lansing didnt have your
raisin

 cut out the sermon lansing
snapped if it hadnt been for you id
a won yeah id a been on my way
you couldnt have won mrs gray
said tommy would have got you if
not tommy then the sheriff or mary
mary would have found out how you
struck it rich she wouldnt have stood
for it weve had your kind in chaco
before youve never won and im al-
ways sorry for you

  lansing muttered something turned
away from her and glared at the deputy
sheriff

  howd you get on my trail in the
first place he demanded

  you made a mistake tom said
you fellers always do that no-
good friend of yours in butte the feller
ghost town lady



you had pickin up your mail and buy-
in you supplies sos you could keep
out of sight you paid him off out of
the bank money you stole he started
spendin it he got drunk and talkative
and we picked him up

  lansing swore mrs gray said sharp-
ly no bad language young man not
in chaco not before ladies the judge
made that rule and it still holds you
let one more hell or damn out of you
and you wont get a thing to eat ive
fed plenty of badmen-but no cussers
mind your manners feller she
means it and shes the best cook in ten
counties you act decent and ill treat

  toms tone was easy-going friendly
lansing looked around at him

  i was goin to kill you he said
dont you hold that agin me

  not no more not since you didnt
make it fact is he grinned it could
be i owe you somethin

  lansing didnt bother to ask what he
meant his face strained he said and
his voice broke i cant face mary
go ahead-lock me up somewhere but
dont drag me in there in front of her
he locked lansing in the cellar mrs
gray prepared a tray of good food for
him and tom carried it down mrs
gray followed with iodine hot water
and bandages she skilfully cleansed
and bandaged his arm

  well head for butte tonight tom
said might be best he dont want
to see miss mary mebbe she dont want
to see him so wed better ride

  the old lady nodded come up and
eat first tommy

  mary wasnt in the big old kitchen
she had gone into her bedroom she
stayed there

its a shock of course but shell
quiet down here with me in chaco
whenll you be cornin out this way
again tommy

  i get sunday off if youd invite
me real nice id dress up and pay you

  but it was mary who was looking for
him that sunday morning she was on
the porch and she saw him a long way
off when he came close she called
out a greeting to him tom took off his
hat and waved mary ran down to
speak to him 

  what will they do to him mary
asked

ered so the bank dont feel very mean

and the sheriff says hes goin to
straighten him out he can do it oh
he gave me a letter for you

  thank you mary said

  go ahead and read it ill hunt up

in with her she needs you

  mary didnt mention lansings letter
when she joined them on the porch
she was quiet and subdued but not un-
happy she smiled quietly later at
the table she burst into laughter at
something mrs gray said

  tom didnt leave until it was dark
then he called out i get next sunday
off too am i invited

  you know you are tommy mrs
gray said

  sunday after sunday tom showed up
in chaco

  it was on the sixth of these sundays
that mrs gray about to call them in to
dinner looked out of the back door and
saw mary and tom near the corral
they were gazing deeply into each
others eyes then they embraced and
tom bent down to kiss her

  mrs gray quietly retreated and
pushed the skillet back on the stove

  they wont be hungry for quite a
spell she murmured think of it
judge little tommy barnes growed
up and kissin girls but shes a mighty
sweet girl judge they make a fine
couple youd be proud of tommy
she wiped away a tear and got very
busy lest she weep if a person started
crying every time she felt like it it
might get to be a habit that would
never do the judge couldnt abide a
weepy woman

 strange how a poker game years back could influence the lives of so many
 people and even bring young folks together to conquer problems and to love

ill avery was on
ly edge with excitement
as he swung himself
down the steps of the
smoker when the train
pulled into hanover
this was several stations before his
destination but he would go on by
horseback and he could make it to



indian creek by dark the trail over the
ridge being considerably shorter than
the route followed by the railroad but
this wouldnt fit into bills plans

  he had waited seven years for this
return to the red hills country which
had finally come with such astonishing
abruptness his right hand went in-
voluntarily to a pocket of his leather
poker winnings



jacket the rustling of paper giving
reality to his recent hurried move-
ments and it came to his mind that
every tick of his watch might now
mark some incident that could material-
ly affect his future course this
thought quickened his step and added
keenness to his glance as he went along
the street to the livery barn with the
intention of at once arranging for the
use of a good saddle horse

  turning into the wide entrance of
the j d watson livery barn he faced
a significant group a tall showily
dressed young fellow held the reins of
a restless thoroughbred with one hand
while the other rested caressingly on
the shoulder of a strikingly pretty
blonde girl the features of his down-
bent face were concealed by the wide
brim of his hat but bill caught the
trustfulness of the blue eyes and a wist-
ful tremor of the girls lips as she
smiled up at her companion his words
were audible as bill passed

  terribly sorry edna i cant stay
over this time he said got a mighty
important piece of business coming up
in indian creek tomorrow but ill be
seeing you soon honey the smooth
pacifying note in his voice brought a
wry twist to bills tanned features

  one of those promising birds he
thought going on into the office

  when he emerged both the rider and
the girl had vanished bill promptly
forgot them in the absorption of his
personal problems until that evening
he was sitting on a bench in the tree-
shaded square around which the town
was built when the blonde girl passed
his gaze clung to her noting again the
charm of her features and slender soft-
ly rounded figure

  thats edna watson his compan-
ion on the bench explained old j
ds daughter-and as fine a girl as she
is pretty its a damn shame van
carters got his eyes set on her

  van carter bill repeated hastily
his jawline hardening

  yep-only son of lem carter over
in the indian creek country van come

to one of our dances got a good look
at edna and swung his loop for her
pronto hes the sort thats got a girl
in every town within ridin distance
but when he marries itll be some-
body with a dad a lot richer than j
d watson

  the carters have money bill
asked careful to speak casually

  id say they have was the reply
what lem hasnt got by luck he has
grabbed by chicanery of some kind
hes about got a strangle holt on his
section of the country

  the strong fingers of bills right
hand closed in a tight grip his gray
eyes had the hard chill glint of steel
here was corroboration of his own be-
lief had it been folly to return to the
neighborhood of the old avery ranch
to place himself in close contact with
the carters could he go ahead quietly
with his plans without betrayal of what
he had in mind perhaps his mother
had been right and he should build his
life against a new background far
from the scene of memories with their
stabbing questions which would re-
quire a near miracle to supply answers

  ill stay he vowed silently how-
ever affairs work out an avery was
the first settler in the red hills the
first white man on indian creek my
grandfather laid out the town we be-
long here-our roots are deep in the
soil and if theres a clue to what
happened that night ill find it

  the stores had been open but a few
minutes next morning when bill rode
into the little cowtown of indian
creek going slowly past well remem-
bered buildings and glimpsing an oc-
casional familiar face stopping be-
fore a red brick two-story structure
he glanced up at the windows above
the double-front store one bore in
fading letters

samuel ordway
attorney-at-law

  satisfaction in his expression bill
tied his horse and mounted the sag-


austin corcoran

ging stairs at the side of the building
a moment later he opened the first door
on the narrow hallway the man at a
rolltop desk glanced up penetrating
hazel eyes appraising his visitor a
gleam kindled in their depths and the
hard lines of his mouth relaxed as he
exclaimed bill avery

  right first guess bill said come
back to stay

  when the two men had shaken hands
a firm grip bill drew a folded news-
paper clipping from his pocket ex-
tending it to the lawyer has that
place been sold he asked

  ordways bushy eyebrows drew into
a frown as he read the printed lines
not yet he replied but-

  fine bill broke in i want you
to put through the deal for me ive
kept an eye on things here through the
county paper as soons i read that old
nate parks was paralyzed and his wife
wanted to sell out quick it was like a
signal to me that now was the time to
come back

  it wont do ordway said flatly
nates ranch parallels lem carters
south range lems wanted it for years
on account of that big spring hes
got a fifteen-hundred-dollar mortgage
on the land and buildings the banks
already got the cattle lems offered
her a thousand dollars cash to cancel
the note and turn the place over to him
shell do it the notes due this week
and not a soul would dare raise lems
ante

  i will bill stated calmly ill
give her three thousand cash yes thir-
ty-five hundred if i have to and she
can take up the note

  youre crazy ordway rasped
youre the last man who ought to
start trouble with lem carter

  bill leaned across the desk to gaze
closely into the attorneys eyes why
should he have it in especially for me
he asked he got our ranch and we
just faded out of the picture answer
me sam-why

  the lawyers frown tightened he
looked away then his eyes turned slow-

ly back to hold bills gaze i dont
know he replied with undeniable hon-
esty but i do know that he hates
the very name of avery when i was
closing up the business for your mother
i sensed that he could hardly wait un-
til you folks were out of this country
hes grabbed a lot of land and put over
some damned hard deals but theres
never been a pin-point of illegality in
one of em and he dont appear to
have any personal feeling about any
of the others

  thats because there was something
crooked about his getting our ranch
bill said grimly

  couldnt have been orway ob-
jected that deal was dead open and
shut i tried damned hard to find a
crack in it lem held the unpaid notes
and your fathers death was pure acci-
dent he was caught by flood water in
wide wash his horse was swept away
and he was flung on those rocks
true bill agreed but ill never
believe nor will my mother that dad
gambled away the money he got for his
cattle i do believe though that he
rode round and paid carter before he
crossed the wash the notes lem later
showed up were forgeries made after
he knew my father had been killed
two witnesses proved that jason
avery lost every cent he had on him
in that poker game at spike dobers
saloon ordway said

  a bartender bill scoffed and-
tod bixby foreman of the x bar
outfit the lawyer put in

  also an ex-convict ive learned
bixby did time in the colorado state
pen for forging the name of lem cart-
ers brother-in-law on a check of
course carter knew this and it gave
him a hold on bixby forged notes-
carter gets the ranch and the money
see what it adds up to bill asked
tensely

  guesswork-and dangerous busi-
ness ordway declared seriously
digging back seven years is too deep
i advise you-

  wait bill exclaimed the fel-
poker winnings



low supposed to have won in that game
could settle the question

  a stranger from new england-
drifting around for his health with a
pack outfit ordway said nobody
even knew his name

  he was a dude and i figure hed stop
in town sometimes bill persisted i
had a hunch to look at the register in
hanover and found that a philip well-
man of orchard beach maine stayed
there two nights before the game
write and see if hes the man we want
after some further argument sam-
uel ordway agreed to carry out bills
requests but keep your suspicions
to yourself he warned insistently
and dont start anything with lem
carter

ill went next to the
post office two small
boys were pummeling
each other and scuf-
fling around the lobby
evading them he
halted near the general delivery win-
dow to wait his turn reflections on
his recent interview with the lawyer
were broken off abruptly when he
glimpsed a girl in the corner of the
room

  she stood with arm uplifted to open
the last box in an upper row and the
beautifully modeled contours of her
figure and the cameo clearness of her
profile were outlined against the white-
washed side wall her skin was only
lightly tanned and there was a lovely
rose color in the visible cheek dark
brown hair as soft and glossy as a
birds wing was gathered into a coil at
the nape of her neck interest kindled
rapidly in bills eyes as he watched her
deft graceful movements

  several letters were thrust into her
handbag one she gazed at for a mo-
ment then a hand flashed to her hair
slender fingers grasepd a pin and slit
the envelope unfolding the sheet of
paper this contained she remained mo-
tionless oblivious to everything be-
yond the written lines she was read-

ing when bills turn came he asked
vaguely for mail the girl was mov-
ing slowly from the corner now her
attention still on the letter suddenly
the wrestling boys swung around
striking her violently and flinging her
forward off balance

  bill caught her before she struck the
floor lifting her to her feet and steady-
ing her with a firm arm the open
letter had slid from her grasp and the
handbag had been flung against the wall
with a force that opened the catch
and scattered the contents

  oh-thank you she exclaimed in
a contralto voice that made bill feel
tingly inside and he saw that her
eyes were a deep blue with those in-
tensely black pupils that have such a
look of mystery no im not hurt
just surprised she laughed

  one man hustled the boys from the
lobby with a sharp reproof and another
gathered up the handbag and spilled
articles bill stooped for the open let-
ter and without intention his eye
caught the lines

  martha darling

    i must see you when you come to
  town wednesday will be at the hote
  at noon if i miss you will ride out to
  the ranch something quite serious has
  happened and i-

  bill wrenched his eyes from the let-
ter his face burning uncomfortably
as he handed this to its owner the
clerk was calling attention to the mail
he had asked for and he stepped back
to the window when he turned the
girl had vanished

  the incident had filled no more than
five minutes yet he felt as if a long
time had elapsed since his entry to the
post office a confusion of impressions
and unfamiliar emotions stayed with
him as he went slowly along the street
he heard the echo of a voice-a laugh
and saw her on the porch of the hotel
those eyes-how deeply blue and ex-
citing they were remembering them
gave bill a sensation of dizziness

  he halted striving to concentrate on
the small happenings about him but


austin corcoran

the teams and horses in the street the
passing pedestrians had a look of un-
reality snap out of it he com-
manded himself youre having a
pipe dream remember-some fellow
calls that girl martha darling and
thats that

  grinning wryly he stepped off at a
brisk pace but the girl in the post
office continued to haunt the edges of
his mind and vainly he reminded
himself that it was none of his business
who had written the letter that brought
the blush to her cheek probably if he
saw her again his impressions would
be quite different no girl was as re-
markable as he remembered this one

  as noon approached he felt an in-
creasing urge towards the hotel final-
ly he whirled and strode rapidly in that
direction it was the best place in town
to eat he excused himself and he was
going to take a room there anyhow

  situated on a corner a porch ex-
tended across the front and down the
street side of the building wooden
chairs stood in a stiff row behind the
railing but all were empty of occu-
pants only the clerk was in the office
where the wall clock assured bill that
it was nearly half past twelve missed
her he thought with rising irritation
that he should feel that decided pang
of disappointment

  a hurrying waitress indicated the
one empty place in the dining room a
chair at a table near the kitchen door
bill turned that way glancing indif-
ferently over the crowd he had nearly
reached the corner when he came to
sudden attention the girl was there-
on his left she was intent on what her
companion was saying and did not see
bill

  he paused briefly sizing up the oc-
cupant of the other chair at her table
the back of a longish head covered
thickly with chestnut hair a shirt of
heavy amber satin a belt adorned with
wide silver conchas-of what did these
remind him he couldnt decide but
he did know at once that he resented
his presence martha was as interest-

ing as he had remembered-more so
bill concluded darting a glance that
way as he slid into his chair but what
the devil was that bird saying to bring
an alarmed look to her face now that
was softening she was startled and
confused

  do you know that fellow in the yel-
lowish shirt he asked the waitress
who came for his order

  she nodded sure-thats van car-
ter she replied and martha leeds
is with him i guess theyll be gettin
married soon shes a smart girl if she
gets van to settle down

  van carter bills mind was churn-
ing wildly of course-he was wear-
ing that same outfit last night in hano-
ver when i saw him with the blonde
so this is the important business he had
on today bill thought boiling with
anger as he unobtrusively studied mar-
that leeds and considered what he
knew of young carter

  he scarcely noticed when his din-
ner was set before him and when the
sash curtain on the window at his right
blew against his cheek he struck at it
with positive savagery wish it was
vans head i punched the damn sneak
making up to a girl like that at the
same time hes got that sweet little
watson kid to thinking hes all for
her

  he noticed that martha ate almost
nothing she appeared worried and ex-
cited her color fluctuating rapidly
when they rose from the table van
slipped a hand through her arm with
proprietary assurance bill was tre-
mendously pleased at the dignity of her
carriage an aloofness which discounted
her companions manner

  again bills anger boiled high as he
recalled the martha darling in what
was likely van carters bold script and
he stabbed furiously at the food on his
plate he was oblivious to footsteps
on the porch outside the window until
aroused by an unmistakable contralto
saying its too dreadfully important
van to make such a quick decision
and when dad feels as he does-

  hell take it all right when were
actually married honey came-in the
same smooth voice bill had heard
speaking to edna watson the previous
day and youll be helping him its
a bad business his getting mixed up
with harve finley but if were mar-
ried my father will fix things up as
soon as i heard a hint that ben leeds
might get in a jam i figured this out
well take the afternoon train over to
the county seat get the license have
the knot tied and take a nice little
honeymoon over the week-end

 but van-im not sure martha
protested

  leave all that to me was the sooth-
ing reply just sit here while i run
over to the bank and think how much
i love you its just because youre
such a shy darling that youve been
hesitating vans voice fell to a ca-
ressing note that caused bill to clench
his hands tightly he had sat in si-
lence making no attempt to give warn-
ing of his nearness from the first
words he had frankly listened

hen young car-
ters footsteps re-
ceded into the dis-
tance for a moment
there was no sound
from the girl then
bills straining ears caught a long sigh-
ing breath at the same instant the
curtain swung inward revealing mar-
tha seated tensely on one of the wood-
en chairs close to the window

  impulsively he exclaimed dont do
it

  she turned with a startled ejacula-
tion her eyes widening with amaze-
ment as they met his gaze instantly
bill knew the enormity of what he had
done but he was in for it now noth-
ing to do but go ahead

  wait he exclaimed thrusting a
hand into his pocket for some coins
that he tossed on the table then he
sprang lightly over the sill and reach-
ing behind him drew down the win-
dow she watched him with a baffling

expression that made it harder to ex-
plain

  i heard what you and van carter
were saying he stated bluntly

  yes her voice was cold

  and it-it seemed to me- he
hesitated wishing she wouldnt look at
him so fixedly what could he say he
was thinking frantically couldnt tell
her van wasnt any good i-hang it
i think its dreadful for you to be-to
be hurried like that getting married
is too-too serious to rush into it and
-and a girl ought to consider what her
father thinks bill could feel moist-
ure trickling through his hair beading
his forehead he had never been in so
uncomfortable a spot

  you dont run a column in the
newspaper do you she asked coolly
offering advice to brides-to-be

  bill felt himself scorching beneath
her steady gaze

  i did sound like a fool he said
honestly but please believe me im
sure you dont really want to be mar-
ried like that you seemed so worried
and unhappy i spoke before i could
stop myself

  indeed she murmured flushing
but it doesnt concern you

  maybe not bill said floundering
on with characteristic tenacity but
please mar-miss leeds go home to-
day and think it over

  whats that it was amazing how
harshly a smooth voice could speak at
times

  neither bill nor the girl had been
aware of van carters approach he
looked sharply from one to the other
martha had again assumed the baffling
expression

  we were just discussing a message
to my father she said calmly

  what was it about your going
home van insisted suspiciously add-
ing as he shot bill an inimical look
who are you ive seen you some
place

  my name is bill avery was the
reply

  old jase averys boy van ex-


austin corcoran

claimed thought you left this coun-
try

  i did for a while bill said with
forced calmness

  ive got to be going along martha
said before carter could speak again
coming van she nodded casually
at bill as the two moved away martha
obviously hurrying the pace

  bill gazed after them a meddler
never done any good he reflected mor-
osely i probably made her plumb
set on marrying that coyote and she
the swellest-looking girl and the smart-
est i ever set my two eyes on kept
her head just as cool as a frosty morn-
ing didnt give me the least idea
what she was thinking-nor him either
managed things as slick as one of them
magicians that pulls rabbits out of a
hat and do i feel like a dumb rabbit
-wow

  he went slowly to the street but
neither martha nor van carter was in
sight he considered going to the rail-
road station but abandoned that idea
while he was debating the best way to
learn if the pair had left town by train
he glimpsed a girl riding into the main
road from the side street he knew led
to the livery barn he couldnt be mis-
taken in the pose of that head and
shoulders that was martha heading
for home

  she turned him down bill thought
with a wave of that same exhilarating
dizziness which had assailed him in the
morning after first encountering her in
the post office he wanted to emit a
jubilant shout then his high spirits
were deflated as he reflected that mar-
tha had probably made her decision
before he spoke and very likely she
detested him for interfering in a strict-
ly personal affair

  late that afternoon he dropped into
samuel ordways office the lawyer
had just returned from the country and
was shaking the dust from his coat
when bill entered

  i saw parks and his wife he said
with customary brevity they accept
your offer of three thousand cash for

the ranch make out the papers tomor-
row

  good bill returned as briefly
who is harve finley

  fellow running for sheriff in oppo-
sition to lem carters pet

 is finley in any trouble bill
asked

  we-ell ordway replied cautious-
ly there are rumors wouldnt sur-
prise me if he does get into some
could be framed

  and who is ben leeds bill went
on with his questioning

 bought the arrowhead ranch
coupla years ago takes sides with
finley

 friends with lem

  no but carter would like to have
van marry the leeds girl the arrow-
head is about the only outfit carter
hasnt been able to dig his claws into-
and martha leeds is her fathers sole
heir

 i see bill said thoughtfully
shes a swell girl

  shes- ordway halted eyeing bill
suspiciously how do you know
and van carter is a rat bill pro-
ceeded ignoring the question

  he is ordway agreed also his
fathers main interest after land grab-
bing and personal power lems kind
will lean backwards to keep within the
law until they get in a panic he could
slip a cog if he feared he was going to
lose face in the community or if a pet
scheme was about to be thwarted if
your suspicions are true he wont want
you around to remind him of that busi-
ness with your father and if you-
if i should show interest in the girl
van wants to marry bill put in cool-
ly there might be-er-something in
the line of fireworks

  the lawyer shrugged lean shoulders
helplessly you were the nerviest kid
i ever saw and you havent changed a
mite was his sole comment

that night bill sent a telegram to
his former employer that read every-
think ok start ted with the cattle
the first of the following week he
poker winnings



took possession of the nate parks
ranch which meant besides land and
buildings a few head of fair saddle
stock his purchase had aroused con-
siderable attention around the country
and ordway declared that carter had
taken it hard though he was keeping
amazingly quiet bill had seen neither
the carters nor martha leeds

  his second morning on the ranch bill
was repairing a corral gate when a
horseman rode into the yard a com-
pactly built man his iron grey hair was
worn rather long and lay smoothly be-
low his hat his closely shaven face
was devoid of wrinkles and wore a
bland expression

  good morning bill he said halt-
ing near the corral

  howdy lem bill replied noncha-
lantly

  youre lucky at your age to have
cash enough to buy this place carter
stated eyeing bill closely

  i worked hard for the stake

 but you havent enough more to
buy cattle lem suggested adding
when bill said nothing and you either
hope to raise some possibly at the
bank or knowing my interest in this
ranch you figured on tricking a still
higher price out of me all right-
well settle the matter now im ex-
panding considerably and can use this
range and water ill give you five
hundred dollars more than you paid

  my reasons for buying are person-
al bill replied staring into the black
eyes that belied the blandness of the
face this ranch positively is not for
sale im here to stay

  ive made my only offer carter
said curtly if your buy was on the
level well-i hate to see a young fel-
low start off with the handicap this un-
stocked place will be and knowing
how unfortunate your father was-

  unfortunate is hardly the word i
would use for what happened to my
father bill broke in making a strong
effort to conceal rising anger he had
not foreseen how difficult it would be

to face carter and restrain his suspi-
cions

  when lem rode off after a few care-
fully casual words bill was tensely on
edge there must be some way of
bringing this business to a head he
thought never could play a waiting
game rather risk everything on the
cards i hold

t the end of the
week cattle were on
bills range and he had
the companionship of
a cowboy he had rid-
den with for several
years leaving ted rising in charge
bill rode to town he wanted to see
ordway and there was to be a horse
sale that afternoon about a mile out
of indian creek he saw a girl rider in
front of him one look and he jabbed
spurs into his horse when he slowed
at her side martha gave him a serene
glance and nod but the air held the
disturbance of an electric current and
he could not think of any ordinary
comment to make

  it seemed that she was similarly af-
fected for after a moment she startled
bill by asking bluntly why were you
so determined to stop me from going
away with van carter that day
w-why i-i told you the reasons
he stammered

  those you stated were not sufficient
to account for your extreme insist-
ence she told him and since you
interfered so inexcusably in my per-
sonal affairs i consider you owe me at
least an explanation

  she was looking squarely at him the
intense color of her eyes adding to the
disturbing mystery of their depths as
before in her presence bill lost all pow-
er to think

  i had to try to stop you he ex-
claimed because i wanted to marry
you myself

  oh the ejaculation was a gasp
marthas serenity vanished and she
blushed to the wave of soft hair below


austin corcoran

her hat were not even acquainted
she said hastily

  didnt need to be he assured her
the minute i saw you in the post of-
fice that morning i let go all holds
but those things i told you were all
true he went on as far as they went
theres no use martha i cant talk to
you even a minute and try to hide what
i think about you and ill fight to the
last second to keep you from marry-
ing van carter-or anybody else

  the flush was subsiding but she
evaded his eyes thanks for the hon-
est reply she said attempting light-
ness and you are excused from fur-
ther explanations

  they were entering town and to
bills dismay before he could say any-
thing further they had turned into the
main street and met van face to face
with a scowling glance at bill he
wheeled in beside martha

  lucky break he said well put
up the horses and go over-

  sorry but ive got to go right on
and meet dad she said coolly see
you some other time

  but martha- van began

  look she exclaimed someones
waving at you

  bill glanced at the sidewalk where
an unusual number of people were
grouped evidently attracted to town by
the sale edna watson wearing an
attractive riding outfit was standing
at the side of the man from whom bill
had rented the horse at the hanover
barn the man had followed her eager
glance and was scowling openly at van
carter

  j d watson ednas father bill
thought relishing vans chagrin but
sorry for the girl whose eyes held such
trust in him then martha was urging
her horse ahead and he heard her softly
utter  by bill the next minute
a team and wagon came between them
and -van had dropped back

  ordway greeted bill with unusual
eagerness

  heard from wellman he said pro-
ducing a letter from his desk

 bill read the main paragraph aloud

     i do recall the game because after
  the first round i lost steadily to the cat-
  tleman especially remember because i
  rode from town with him next morning
  to a tall red pinnacle rock where he
  turned off to pay a mortgage in full he
  told me what he had won made it pos-
  sible for he had only meant to take up
  half always considered that a happy
  loss

 guess that about settles it bill
said with deep gravity only one red
rock like that along any of the roads
and its where the trail heads off for
carters outfit

 a long way from bringing home
anything to him im afraid ordway
declared dubiously

  no bill said with quick decision
the sale is about to start theres a
gang gathered there im going to
come right out in the open

 wait ordway shouted vainly as
bill dashed from the room and down
the stairway into the street the law-
yer followed as fast as he could but by
the time he had reached the open lot
near the hotel bill was on the auction-
eers block and had the attention of the
crowd

 many of you were my fathers
friends he said in a clear carrying
voice some were our neighbors i
know you will be glad with me that

i	can now prove that he did not gam-
ble away the money which would keep
us from dispossession the letter was
read aloud accompanied by an explana-
tion of its source

 what about them fellows saying
jase avery lost his wad a voice de-
manded from the crowd

 they were mistaken-or they had
reason to make false statements bill
replied every syllable audible to the
farthest pair of ears all of you know
that spike dobers bartender left this
country ahead of a sheriffs posse a
few dollars could have bought his testi-
mony and sam ordway holds records
that prove tod bixby served time in
the pen for forging a check-with the
name of lem carters brother-in-law
poker winnings



you knew that lem this question
shot straight at the white face of the
man addressed anybody with a hold
on bixby could have given him or-
ders to do or to say anything bills
steady gaze held the eyes of the crowd

  he saw van partly concealed by two
broad-shouldered old cattlemen near
the fringe of the onlookers and bill
caught the gleam of savage fury in
vans eyes as somebody demanded of
bill what you trying to prove young
fellow

  the truth youve all heard me and
can do your own thinking bill re-
plied adding only one more word
my fathers coat was torn off and lost
in the flood anything in the nature
of a receipt-or a canceled note-would
have been lost

 damn you the frenzied shout
was followed by a sharp explosion a
bullet struck the post behind bills
head as he ducked and catapulted him-
self through the jam of men

 van shot came a yell it was
van

  young carter pulled trigger for a
second time his face distorted to a
mask of fury men sprang back as bill
flung himself towards van stooping
low then coming up in a terrific lunge
hard fist striking carter on the chin
while his other hand gripped the wrist
above the forty-five van fought with
the unleashed fury of insanity bill
with the deadly purpose of a man who
knows exactly what he is doing the
impact of flesh on flesh the explosion
of gunfire were followed by a cracking
of bone as vans crushed wrist drooped
and the forty-five fell to the ground

 sam ordway was shouting and the
cold hard tones of the sheriff rang
above the tumult get him boys
that officer ordered lem too his

tall sinewy figure strode toward the
elder carter who stood as if frozen to
the ground guess we dont need
much more proof of the truth after
vans break

  it was some time before bill could
extricate himself from the crowd the
tide of feeling against the carters
surged higher and higher vans bro-
ken words as he was led off to the jail
were an even more complete betrayal of
carter guilt and there were a dozen
witnesses to attest to his attempt to
shoot bill

  bill turned into a side street and
walked slowly along trying to quiet his
excitement and sort his thoughts
quick light steps behind him were un-
heeded until a soft call stopped him
bill-wait

  martha came quickly to his side she
caught his arm with both hands and
looked up into his face you were
splendid she exclaimed you should
hear what people are saying

  the seriousness of bills face yielded
to a smile poker is a great game
he said but lets forget that now
im a lot more interested in what you
think of my reason for taking a hand
in your affairs

 dark eyelashes veiled her eyes
we-ell she said slowly i might
say i found it very interesting

  then bill kissed her couldnt have
managed that if you had been looking
at me he whispered your eyes are
too dazzling and now lets go some
place and talk things over how about
getting our horses and riding out to
your place well be all set to break
the news to your father when he comes
home

 oh martha murmured blushing
deeply hes there now i only said
that to get rid of van

sometimes it really does happen-a
man and girl look at each other and
know that this moment is what theyve
always waited for and if the girl is
engaged to another man what then

he main street of law-
rence was so crowded
that the passing streams
of people jostled each
other and strangers
walked shoulder to shoul-
der the air was charged with carni-
val but some of the faces in the crowd
made faith byers afraid they were
faces which belonged not to the range
but to the back streets of cities pasty
jowls and watchful furtive eyes

  what would happen when her fath-
er who had mounted the steps of the
newest and biggest saloon tried to talk
to them she glanced at his slight fig-
ure and serene old face and ran up the
steps to his side dad its not digni-
fied for you to preach here a minister
doesnt talk on the public streets
anthony byers looked at her with
gentle reproof ive explained faith
people in this town wont come to
church so i must go to them its my
duty



 but-

  please and lifting his voice he
called to the men and women on the
sidewalk you must see the truth-
all of you this can be the greatest
country in the world there is wealth
at your feet and freedom if you want
it but whats happening corrupt



marian ohearn

politicians rule the land not honest
men you fight over whether there
shall be territorial law or state gov-
ernment but which of the two factions
is honorable do you ask that
aw quiet down a raucous voice
bellowed shut him up boys lets
dunk him in a barrel of beer

  half a dozen men wheeled out of the
crowd and faith stepped in front of
her father he has a right to speak
she told them angrily you dont
have to listen but you cant stop him
confronted by the slim dark-haired
girl they paused sheepishly but a wom-
an at the rear of the crowd shrilled
this town doesnt want any holy
joes go get him

 once more the rush started and
faiths lips went white she darted
forward to meet the threatening rqen
crying let him alone if you hurt
him-

  we wont hurt him well just give
him a little lesson

  not this time brother the words
rang through the uproar like the snap
of a pistol hammer and a pony charged
straight up the steps sending men
leaping out of the way at the top the
horseman wheeled widely and crowd-
ed the last of the mob away from the
elderly minister

  move back into the street the rider
said and as he dropped to the ground
the guns lifted from his holsters into
his hands

  the crowd hesitatedand there were
a few indistinct sullen shouts but
then people began to move again twin
streams flowing past the saloon steps

  the man slid his guns into the hol-
sters at his thighs and grinned his
glance moving over faith they
wont come back for a while he said
but maybe youd better give up the
speech-making

 he was big and his faded clothes
were covered with dust his skin was
darkened by wind and sun into an al-
most coppery brown but his hair was
fair enough to catch the light and there
was youngness on his face

  anthony byers said calmly i have
to make speeches thank you for your
help but these are my people and they
must listen to me

  the gray eyes narrowed until they
were as thin as the edge of minted
coins youd better not this towns
kind of rough

  its not only rough its depraved
theres no sense in staying in my
church and preaching to empty pews
people need me and i have to go where
they can hear me

  if theyre that stubborn why both-
er with them letem look after them-
selves

  youre right faith broke in but
dad thinks they dont know what
theyre doing he wants them to de-
velop this country instead of letting
political bosses rob them while they
carouse

  his eyes touched hers held them
their clear hardness was like a shock
but then the metallic quality disap-
peared or she imagined that it had
imagined a boys warm gaze was an-
swering hers he said in a tone which
she was to always remember my
names pat ransome maam im a
stranger here just got down from my
place way up in the blue river coun-
try

  before faith could answer her father
put out his hand im anthony byers
and this is my daughter if you cant
find a place to stay our home is open
to you lawrence is so crowded you
may need a bed

  thank you sir ransome hesi-
tated over the words and his gaze went
back to the girl ill probably stay at
the great western hotel meeting a
friend of mine he paused and then
added maybe you know him-tom
knox hes been in lawrence for some
years

  faiths blue eyes sharpened against
his face and she told herself of
course he would be a friend of knoxs
he would have to be but there was a
sharp almost stunned second of loss
as if something precious had been torn
man from blue river



from her hands just as she tried to
grasp it

  her father straightened and his face
chilled weve met mr knox good
day and taking faiths arm he start-
ed hurriedly down the steps

  wait a minute maam ransomes
voice was low and his hand lifted as if
to touch her it dropped at once but
she remembered that too remembered
the shape and strength of his lifted
hand maybe youd better tell me how
tom knox stands with you id guess
you dont care much for him

  faith did not want to meet his eyes
but her glance lifting against her will
was caught by his caught in a com-
mand which was like hands holding
her

  her father said we know very lit-
tle of him and couldnt tell you any-
thing important good day young
man

  ransome stepped back so that they
could pass but faith knew that his gaze
was following her and at the bottom
of the steps she glanced back he was
standing motionless looking after
them and his eyes were like new-mint-
ed coins

  anthony byers murmured im sor-
ry hes one of knoxs pals well for-
get about it

 yes but she was wondering at
her feeling of loss that man pat ran-
some had been like an answer for
which she was waiting

ii

a ll of the territory knew about
knox who had fought his way up
through dishonest petty politics to
ruthless power he had been involved
in every kind of land and mining graft
and when accused laughingly admit-
ted the facts insisting that everyone
in the country was trying to do the
same thing so strongly entrenched
that not even an open admission of
guilt could harm him he controlled the
local government by filling every pub-
lic office with his hirelings he re-

ceived revenue from every bar gam-
bling hall and dive in lawrence

  still the girl said suddenly if
ransomes a stranger here-

  the roar of a gun cut through her
words and even as she whirled people
were running for cover the gun
barked again and the street was empty
-except for pat ransome his wea-
pons had flipped in that swift deadly
dance into his hands and there was a
dark blotch on the sleeve of his shirt
he had been shot

  blood dripped from his hand but he
was facing a side street which met the
main thoroughfare directly in front of
the saloon and his guns were leveling
carefully faith saw the other man
then he was clinging to the shelter of
a wall as he slid away both ransomes
weapons spoke and the man went down
still pressing against the brown brick
wall

  ransome waited erect and motion-
less the last of the sunlight raying over
his fair head and faiths breath
caught in her dry mouth and she told
herself his eyes look like that again
-like the edges of a coin

  he stirred finally and walked toward
the mound which had been a man the
movement aroused anthony byers
from his shock and he ran across the
street faith followed and when she
reached them her father was kneeling
beside the still figure ransome was
staring down at the dead man and his
face was almost calm

  youve-killed him she said be-
cause she had to say something had to
break the terrible stillness

  he looked at her but his eyes did
not see her yeah he would have
killed me if i hadnt

  she was silent and his glance flicked
oddly over her face ill tell the sher-
iff about it he said sorry you had
to be here

 as he turned away a man with a
small bag in his hand crossed the street
and said matter-of-factly better let
me look at your arm gunshot wounds
can cause trouble it was mike har-


marian ohearn

vey one of the two physicians in law-
rence

  thanks but not now ill see you
later its not bad and ransome
went on at that swift even pace

 harvey swung around and seeing
faith started angrily toward her
whats the idea of standing out in
the street with a shooting match going
on

  it was over before i knew it had
happened she said and her glance fol-
lowed pat ransome

  the young doctor shifted his bag and
pulled her arm through his he glared
at her father she might have been
killed why didnt you get her out
of the way

  anthony byers smiled ive never
managed to make her accept orders
thats why i dont try to give em
youd both better go home har-
vey snapped well take this carriage
at the corner

  he helped faith and her father up
and sitting at the girls side looked at
her grimly i thought you promised
not to have any part in this street
preaching

  promised her blue glance lifted
to his face i dont think i said any-
thing mike you just told me
but you knew i took it for granted
anthony byers laughed drily
which shows that doctors know less
about women than ministers never
take anything concerning them for
granted

 faith smiled at harvey she had
known him for almost two years ever
since she and her father arrived in law-
rence and she knew that some day
when she was really ready she would
marry him he was everything she
wanted in a husband good-looking
capable and hard-working until she
met him she had not known that a man
could be so gentle and yet completely
strong

 he touched her hand make the
promise now-then ill only worry
about you part of the time

  but i cant let dad go out alone he

might be killed today- but she
stopped suddenly not wanting to tell
mike about pat ransome

  what happened today

  anthony byers spoke quickly i
started to talk in front of the oasis
bar and some toughs threatened me
a young fellow-probably a gunnie
himself-stopped them someone shot
him a minute after we left

  the man who wouldnt let me take
care of his arm harveys voice was
startled and his hazel glance touched
faith he didnt look like a gunnie
to me

  fire beat up into the girls cheeks
and her blue eyes darkened he must
be hes a friend of tom knox
harveys glance still on her face be-
came intent and her hand lifted to her
throat where an angry pulse was beat-
ing against the flesh but he did not
speak until they reached the parson-
age where he said i think wed bet-
ter have a talk

  the color in her cheeks became even
more fiercely bright mike pat ran-
somes a stranger in lawrence yet
someone tried to shoot him why
would anyone want to kill a stranger
there might be reasons i heard
that tom knox was bringing in a man
to run for the legislature the nom-
inations all set and knoxs friends al-
ways win the elections

  oh the glow in her face faded
and once more she knew that sense of
loss would the state party resort to
murder

  might not have been the state par-
ty-just someone who didnt want
knoxs man to be nominated hes al-
ways careful about the people he brings
in to run for office theyre invariably
strangers with clean records at least
as far as anyone in the territory knows
thats playing it safe

  a clean record she murmured
have you ever seen a freshly minted
coin thats what-

  faith harveys hand closed on
her arm and he drew her toward the
house i dont give a damn about this
man from blue river



mail ransome i want to talk about us
your fathers gone inside so well sit
on the porch

  he put her onto the porch couch and
sat beside her this latest idea of
preaching sermons on the street is cra-
zy i cant keep my mind on my work
because im always wondering if youre
in trouble

 but you know-

  let me finish he took her hands
in his firm strong ones why dont
you marry me so i can really look after
you this isnt a womans country
and girls like you can get hurt

  faith went very still so still that
even her breath paused mike was ask-
ing her to marry him just as she had
dreamed he was waiting so close that
she could see the line of his mouth and
the healthy grain of his skin for
months she had thought of this mo-
ment but now that it had come some-
thing was missing something which
had to be between them is that the
only reason why you want to marry me
so you can look after me

  his head lifted and his eyes grew
sharp well he murmured you
can play the coquette too i didnt
believe it

  she flushed and stopped searching for
the magic the moment should have
had perhaps every woman can-at
times she said and thought of pat
ransome with his narrowed searching
eyes would he ask a girl to marry him
so that he might look after her or
would it be only because he couldnt
live without her

 sorry darling mike murmured
i shouldnt have said that i can make
pretty speeches too

 then make some

  no there are better ways and his
head bent over hers he claimed her
lips with the tenderness which was part
of him a tenderness that was ines-
capable and yet could never be soft-
ness

  but when he released her there were
stinging tears in her eyes what mike
whom she had hoped to marry was of-

fering wasnt enough she was seeing
pat ransomes face remembering him
as he had stood in the light looking
after her he had come to lawrence
so that knoxs thievery and graft could
control another public office-yet he
was making her forget the touch of
mikes lips

  faith harvey said softly im
leaving guess i muffed things this
time

 no-wait she got up and her
hands clung to him you didnt muff
anything

  he put his fingers under her chin
and tilted her face up to his sure
he asked huskily youve got to be
sure

  instead of answering she lifted her
mouth and a moment later whispered
no one could ever find a better hus-
band than youll be

 he laughed and pushed her gently
away from him hold that theory
lady just now ive got work to do by
the time i get back therell probably
be a few more gunshot cases

ill

aith was finishing the
supper dishes when she
heard her father leave his
study and go softly along
the hall to the front door
she raced out of the kitch-
en calling where are you going
to make this town listen to me
you didnt think id give up

  please dont youll be hurt
  thats not important

  realizing that she could not stop
him she turned swiftly toward her own
room saying then ill go with you
as soon as i get a wrap

  he nodded absently and waited for
her to join him for the short walk to
the business district but as they ap-
proached the great western hotel
they were almost forced off the side-
walk by the surging reckless crowd
looks as if tom knox is holding open
house byers said grimly i suppose


marian ohearn

his political gang is in town to look
over the nominee the boys have great
times on the taxpayers money

  the space in front of the hotel was
almost impassable for hundreds of men
had wedged themselves into the street
to stare at the office holders as faith
and her father neared the doors the
crowd thrust back to make an opening
for a group of men emerging from the
hotel they were shouting with laugh-
ter and one of them pausing on the
steps called to the crowd you know
old judge foster boys well we just
found out he tried to kiss one of the
hotel chambermaids this morning
were giving him a trial by kangaroo
court all we need is the accusing wit-
ness

  wont find any witnesses this time
of the night someone shouted back
the women in this town stay inside
after dark

  the merry roisterer on the steps of
the hotel made a large gesture find
someone got to be girls around he
paused stared down at faith and then
roared theres one bring her in
she can accuse the judge make it
good girlie make it hot hell have a
time tonight

  the politicians companions charged
down the steps and faiths father
pushed her behind him are you all
crazy he demanded not even tom
knoxs hired men would do this

  ah get out of the way were not
going to harm her one of them swept
the girl off her feet and when anthony
byers tried to stop him shoved the old
minister back against the crowd

  faith tried to twist free and failing
struck wildly at the mans face but he
changed his grip so as to hold down
her arms and continued with much
laughter up into the lobby

  there was a roar of amusement as he
staggered across the lobby carrying the
struggling girl and someone pushed
open the doors to the main floor ban-
quet room

  heres our witness he set her
down in a room thick with smoke and

filled with half-drunken men get the
trial going gentlemen well see
whether judge foster can insult the
womanhood of lawrence

  faith put her hands on the back of a
chair to steady herself and drew a long
careful breath somehow she would
hold back the blazing anger which
made her want to strike out at the men
around her

  the man at the head of the table was
a big once-powerful figure with an old
young face his jaw was soft with
wadded fat and too much flesh drooped
down over his small dark eyes tom
knox the political boss of lawrence
who was said to steal a million dollars
a year from the taxpayers and make
them like it was grinning with delight
as he gestured toward faith with a
cigar held between pudgy fingers

  someone was ploughing toward him
-and then faith saw that it was pat
ransome his eyes were like no color
she had ever seen and his coppery
bronze skin was white the long nar-
row banquet table was directly in front
of him and he leaped over it as he made
for the girls captor she heard the
ugly thud of flesh against bone as his
fists struck and a man roared for
gods sake pat stop stop
ransomes hands were on the others
throat and his face was that of a sav-
age the sight of him sent a sick hor-
ror surging through the girl but to her
own surprise she ran toward him
youd better let him go she said
and her high thin words cut through
the din youre one of tom knoxs
paid politicians too these are your own
kind

  his eyes lifted and color began to
creep back into his face he released
the feebly struggling man and let him
fall to the floor

  wheres your father he asked
through stiff barely moving lips

  outside she was already running
for the door they may have killed
him by this time

  the crowd in front of the hotel broke
apart and she saw a group of men gath-
man from blue river



ered around something on the walk
dad she cried

  anthony byers face was bloodless
and his body seemed curiously crum-
pled but before she could touch him
pat ransome lifted her to her feet

  ill look after him hes probably
just knocked out he swung around
to the nearest man get a doctor-
fast theres one named harvey down
the street tell him were taking mr
byers home

  he lifted the ministers slight body
and opened the door of a carriage
which had drawn up to the curb plac-
ing the old man carefully on the back
seat he said hes not badly hurt
hell be all right

  youre not leaving now

  the odd gray glance flickered no
he said softly im taking you home
the doctor ought to be there almost as
soon as we are

 the doctor was mike faith with
her fathers head pillowed in her lap
wondered why she could not call up a
picture of his face if she could visual-
ize the strength of his mouth and the
kindness of his eyes she would remem-
ber other things too

  the carriage crawled to a halt in
front of the house and ransome carried
the minister in she hurried ahead to
show him the way and the door-knock-
er banged

  faith mike harveys voice came
from the hall

  in here its dad

  she started out to him only to stop
and look up at the man at her side
something moved in his eyes but in-
stead of speaking he turned out of the
room and when she followed he and
mike harvey were facing each other
silently

 hurry she cried dad was
knocked down and hurt

  mike walked into the bedroom ill
want your help faith his tones were
cool and clipped his eyes impersonal

  as he bent over her father she said
nervously pat ransome was there at
the hotel when we-

  not now mike interrupted you
can tell me about it later

 her head jerked up and her eyes
widened against his face but he was
not looking at her nor was he aware
of her

 why is he unconscious so long
she whispered

  shock ill bring him out of it but
hell have to stay in bed for a few
days he pulled the pillow from un-
der anthony byers head and took a
phial from his bag as he held it to the
ministers lips he said you can go
out now ill undress him

  once more faiths eyes widened as
she looked at the young physician was
this the answer was the magic miss-
ing from his caresses because no wom-
an could ever have all of him he
was a stranger now a cool detached
stranger conscious only of the doctors
eternal struggle with life and death
what of it she asked herself an-
grily even part of him is enough-
and maybe no man ever gives all of
himself

iv

ansome was wait-
ing in the hall stand-
ing straight and erect
and still just as he
had stood while her
father prayed beside
the man he had shot how is he
still unconscious but the doctor
says hell be all right hes suffering
from shock

  he nodded and was silent as if wait-
ing for her to go on when she did
not speak he said theres something
id like to tell you but wed better not
talk here

 why- but her words stopped
and she moved uneasily past him to
the living room

  he came in slowly his gray glance
knifing over the room taking in every-
thing in it when she sat down he
pulled a chair directly before her

  i want to explain about tom knox


marian ohearn

he said i knew him a long time ago
when we were kids in texas i worked
for the same outfit and we covered a
lot of trails together he left years
ago and i didnt know where he was
when i came to the territory to start a
spread in the blue river country

  a week ago an hombre showed up
at my spade ranch and said tom need-
ed me here in lawrence i came-be-
cause id have expected him to come
if id sent for him but i wasnt ready
for what i found knox isnt the man
i used to know he doesnt even look
the same after i get him straightened
out on what his gang pulled tonight
im heading back to the blue river
country

  his coppery bronzed face was almost
tense but his gaze was that of a boy
young and warm or perhaps she was
imagining that because his eyes seemed
to command her to say disturbing
soundless words

  then youve probably found out
what tom knox means to lawrence
he and his crowd are turning it into
the most corrupt dishonest town in the
west

  the thin look about his mouth be-
came more marked if the people of
the territory wanted honest govern-
ment theyd force the politicians to
give it to them so im not worried
about that

  then why did you want me to know
about your friendship with knox
the light which had made his eyes
young suddenly flared high because
youre you when i go back to the
blue river country i want you to go
with me

  color raced up her throat and re-
ceded so swiftly that her face was pa-
per white she started to her feet then
sat down again almost helplessly he
had held her as much as if he had put
his hands on her

  i dont know what you mean she
said the words almost whispering
through her dry lips i dont know
you we only saw each other a little
while ago

  weve always known each other
at least ive always known you may-
be ive been waiting for you ive heard
it happened that way but i didnt be-
lieve it until now faith he was
bending over her and the light which
had moved in his eyes was also glowing
behind the flesh of his face

  she shook her head trying to find
words to stop him struggling to say
that he must not touch her but his
hands were already on her drawing her
toward him and his mouth was crush-
ing down on hers she could never
remember all of that kiss which
stretched over an endless second she
only knew that his lips sent a savage
song into her blood a wild rhythm
which was hard as his eyes and his
arms

  she had hunted for an elusive magic
with mike harvey and had not found
it was this that magic no it was
wilder and deeper something she
could never forget nor escape now that
she had known it his arms loosened
and she felt him straighten he lifted
his head and looked toward the door
there was someone there  mike har-
vey

  she turned unsteadily and felt pats
quick supporting hand on her arm
she did not speak but she and mike
looked at each other across the length
of the room

  finally he made an odd gesture and
put his bag down on a table maybe
he said and his voice sounded weary
id better talk to you alone ran-
some

  pats hand left faiths arm and she
heard him say you can talk to me
any time-but is there any special rea-
son to do it now

  im afraid there is miss byers is
my fiancee

  ransome did not speak and faith
facing mike wondered how many min-
utes were dragging by in a stillness
which grew sharper than a scream she
wet her dry lips and put her hand
against the hard pulse in her throat be-
fore she was able to turn his eyes
man from blue river



looked down at her almost calmly and
they were the gray of minted coin
then his glance went back to harvey

  seems to have been a misunder-
standing doc you neednt bother to
do any talking its all said adios
and good night to you maam

  he walked past her to the door mov-
ing evenly and surely his face seemed
darker than ever and his hair more bril-
liantly fair pat the word burst
from her lips where are you going
he paused and looked back to see
about getting nominated to the terri-
torial legislature

  faith listened to pat ransomes foot-
steps going down the hall heard the
closing of the front door only then
did she turn back to mike harvey and
he said quickly your fathers con-
scious but i want him to sleep
thank you she sat down and
waited as he crossed the room to her

  you shouldnt have done that he
said quietly hes not a man to play
with and i dont think hes the kind
who plays himself

  maybe i dont understand

  mike smiled wryly its simple
enough and dont look like that i
guess i knew this afternoon that you
werent for me

  she made herself meet his eyes
what are you telling me

  just that our engagements ended
his face no longer looked drawn
but there was a new crookedness at the
corners of his mouth

  would you let me go like this so
easily mike listen to me pat ran-
somes a stranger i dont know why i
kissed him or why i wanted to but
its over now and it has nothing to do
with us with what we might have
the crooked grin deepened im
afraid it has a lot to do with us i
wouldnt have told ransome youd
promised to marry me except that he
isnt for you either hes not your
kind and you wouldnt like being mar-
ried to one of tom knoxs hired hands
theyre worse than professional gun-
men because a gunnie can only ruin a

few lives - they destroy thousands
that means you decided then as
soon as you saw us together-

  i decided you shouldnt be engaged
to anyone until youve grown up he
took his bag from the table ill be
around in the morning

 mike wait she went to him
quickly her hands lifting in appeal i
wish it hadnt happened you have to
believe that please kiss me good
night so that ill know-

  so youll know i still want to hold
you in my arms

  she stopped and stared at him with
darkening eyes is that what you
think of me

  he turned to the door good night
faith he said crisply and he too
moved quietly down the hall and out
of the house

  it was a long time before she went
to her own room and got into bed
knowing she would not sleep the dark-
ness was a curtain on which played
vivid pictures of pat ransome and it
also showed her mike harvey smiling
drily to hide the tenderness of his
mouth

a t dawn she got up and pulling
on her clothes went to her fathers
room finding him asleep she started
a fire in the kitchen range and began
to prepare breakfast the sun would
be up soon and pat ransome would be
moving about in the sunlight apart
from her and out of her life as she
measured coffee into the pot there was
a sound like a soft footstep on the back
porch she listened the spoon in mid-
air had she actually heard the door
opening it couldnt be

  but it was it swung in slowly and
a man stepped into the kitchen tom
knox the political boss of lawrence
he looked at her with his appraising
heavy-lidded dark eyes and said
good morning maam i saw a light
and figured you were awake hows
your father i heard he was roughed
up a bit last night

  yes your men did the roughing


marian ohearn

  im sorry about that and the boysll
pay for it too mind if i sit down
he pulled out a kitchen chair as
much at ease as if before dawn calls
were a frequent occurrence heard
pat ransome was here last night that
he brought your father home after he
was hurt

  faith was silent watching his un-
naturally heavy face with the folds of
soft flesh beneath a chin which should
have been hard

  ransome got plenty excited when
that crazy fool dragged you in off the
street as a witness in his kangeroo
court the man didnt mean any real
harm and it wouldnt have happened if
he hadnt been drunk

  that didnt make it any pleasanter
still id hate to think it would
cause serious trouble for ransome
how could it cause trouble for
him

  knox shrugged his thick shoulders
he seems to have gotten ideas may-
be he got them after talking to you
late last night he showed up in front
of the great western hotel and made
a wild-eyed speech wanted the peo-
ple of lawrence to drive me out of the
territory knox paused and chuckled
softly and i brought him here any-
how he told the crowd that he was
going to run for the nomination-in-
dependently independently thats
funny isnt it maam as if anybody
could get elected like that in this coun-
try

  the thickly enfolded eyes were un-
smiling and watchful but faith was
no longer seeing them pat ransome
hadnt become a political puppet in-
stead he was going to fight knox if
he could get the people behind him  

  too bad knox broke in and his
voice held that thick laughter it
wouldnt work just couldnt maam
suppose the people of this district
were crazy enough to line up behind
a man without any political connec-
tions whatd happen

  maybe there would be honest gov-
ernment

  depends on how you look at those
things but if ransome got too many
people on his side it wouldnt be nice
-because he wouldnt live long

  the slow casual words sent ice into
the girls veins and the mans dark
eyes told her that he meant exactly
what he had said ransome had been
his friend but he would die if he tried
to stand in knoxs way

  she stepped back uncomfortably
why are you telling me this maybe
you ought to tell pat ransome

  ill do that too but hes a stubborn
hombre thought maybe you could
make him listen

  why i never saw him until yes-
terday and i dont expect to see him
again

  no knox murmured thats too
bad he acted pretty interested but
maybe he doesnt know about young
doc harvey

  he got up and started for the door
letting his words trail after him but
with his hand on the knob he went on
ransomes an explosive jasper you
saw that last night he would have
killed someone if he hadnt been
stopped might not be safe for the doc
if pat found out

  wait a minute mr knox i dont
like what youve said and you had no
right to come here dont do it again
i wont maam but remember
about ransome he plays for keeps
the door snapped closed but she
heard him chuckle as he went down
the steps

v

hen faith took a
breakfast tray into
her fathers room at
eight oclock she
was dressed for the
street and the sick
man smiled i like that outfit he
murmured but isnt it a bit fancy for
doing housework

  im going out if youre well enough
to be alone for a while
man from blue river



  of course im well enough cant
you wait for young harvey to get here
its still early

  faith attempted to smile but her lips
twisted and she turned away im not
going to see mike dad- she glanced
at her reflection in the mirror-do you
really like this dress

  of course

  but she did not hear him for she was
trying to see herself through a mans
eyes through pat ransomes eyes the
dove-gray frock hugged her slim waist
and the full graceful skirt was so long
that only the tips of her slippers
showed a spray of rose-pink plume
dipped over the side of the matching
gray bonnet and rested against her
black curls she was glad that her hair
was so dark because it made her skin
seem very fair her eyes were good
too deep blue and just large enough

  faith stop mooning i hate to see
a girl admire herself

  i wasnt-that is im not sure about
this dress now im going to leave you
for a few minutes mike will be in
later

  she hurried out in the warm sunlight
and started for the great western
hotel through streets as crowded as
they had been the night before but
today the mood of the crowd was dif-
ferent groups of men and women
talked in undertones and others moved
quietly toward the main thoroughfare
which was lined with hastily made ban-
ners

  the largest banner fluttered over a
building opposite the great western
hotel where workmen were erecting a
platform the breeze caught the home-
made pennant and shook it out in front
of the girls eyes clean up law-
rence it read nominate pat ran-
some

 dozens of other signs shrieked
tom knoxs machine is through
pat ransome will represent the peo-
ple not the office holders

 warmth stirred through faith it
was really happening he was actu-

ally defying knox and apparently the
people of lawrence were determined
to support him

  the lobby of the great western was
almost empty and the clerk said mr
ransomes no longer here youll find
him across the street in that building
where theyre putting up the stand

  as she reached the entrance of the
shabbv office building pat appeared in
the doorway

 i saw you coming he said is
there anything i can do for you
ye-es id like to talk to you

  he hesitated and the corners of his
lips moved of course maam come
in he led the way into what had once
been a store and pulled out an ancient
chair we havent much of a political
headquarters

  i dont want to sit down i have to
tell you something

  if its about last night please dont
ive forgotten it

  she stiffened and anger flickered
through her did he think she had
come here to beg if he hadnt known
the truth when he held her in his
arms    have you really forgotten
she asked making her voice light

  his glance was a cold touch on her
face yes maam

 she smiled deliberately and her
growing anger flung scarlet banners
into her cheeks in that case you
shouldnt have told me its not polite
to tell any woman you could ever for-
get her

  his mouth clamped into a thin line
you said you had something to tell
me

  i have in that half-edged half-
flirtatious tone but first id like to
be sure because you see-i havent for-
gotten you

 his eyes blazed fire burning
through their chill in that case he
said his words a thin drawl i under-
stand your being here he moved
toward her almost calmly and took her
into his arms laughing when she tried
to escape

  i should have told you i play for


marian ohearn

keeps and he kissed her with hard
lips

  she shivered and wanted to sob no
wild dangerous sweetness in this just
anger and fierce challenge the kind
of kiss no man should know about

  she drove her small clenched fists
against his chest and broke away from
him but his face was quiet and his
eyes unreadable i shouldnt have
done that and you shouldnt have come
here to make me do it

  she tore her glance free and started
for the door hoping he would not see
the tears that were burning into her
eyes but as she remembered she
stopped and made herself face him
tom knox came to see me this morn-
ing he said that if you win the nom-
ination youll be killed

 ransome grinned you neednt
have told me that maam but thanks
just the same i figure knoxs crowd
will do anything to protect themselves
so im ready for a little lead-throw-
ing

  he controls this country he can
give orders to thousands of men hes
filled every office with people who obey
him if he orders them to kill you-
theyll try to do it but i dont in-
tend to let them thanks again maam
he made the last words an ending
but she could not go instead she re-
mained at the door looking at him
feeling all of her pride being stripped
away from her

  i didnt come here to-to make you
kiss me she said her voice a low cry
and last night-

  his face closed and his eyes did not
seem to see her i told you last night
never happened maam id rather re-
member this morning then it wont
be important

  faith felt the breath stop in her
throat and fire poured over her face as
if his hard palm had cracked against
her cheek she jerked blindly at the
door and plunging through it found
herself caught in a crush of men mill-
ing about the entrance to the building
curious onlookers were mingled with

the workers and with the soft-faced
sharp-eyed adherents of tom knox

  she got through at last and turning
toward home had to force herself not
to run she would not sob not now
or ever instead she would always re-
call pat ransomes insolent stinging
words

 faith mike harveys voice
stopped her as she saw his face fear
struck at her

  what is it she cried have you
seen dad

  yes i just came from your house
your fathers fine

  but somethings happened

  he hesitated ive got to ask you a
question i dont like did pat ran-
some go back to see you after i left
last night

 go back to see me- she did not
understand even as she repeated the
words but then her eyes turned very
blue and some of the girlishness left
her face im sorry mike that
wouldnt have hurt so much if it had
come from anyone else

 listen his hand closed impa-
tiently on her arm you know me too
well to think id get nasty ive just
got to know-because of something i
heard

 are you serious what did you
hear pat didnt come back but even
if he had-

 im afraid you dont understand
what such a story means when its told
by the man involved-in a town like
this

  but it couldnt have- she stopped
and her voice trailed off into a thin
high sound told by the man in-
volved   oh no she said her tone
once more firm and steady and her
breath more even

  mikes face tightened ill drop in
tonight better get home and look
after your father

 where are you going

 instead of answering he moved
swiftly away toward the main street
she watched him for a moment and
something in the set of his shoulders
man from blue river



the carriage of his head frightened
her

 mike wait

  he did not turn or pause and she ran
after him if he went to pat ransome
with whatever story had been repeated
to him but who could have thought
of such an ugly little tale only a few
people knew that she had met ransome
but one of those people was tom knox

  harvey turned into the main street
and when she reached the corner he had
disappeared the crowds got in her
way and the street before ransomes
headquarters was almost impassable
but finally she worked her way to the
doors and asked the nearest man is
dr harvey here

  yeah just came a few minutes ago

  a gun crashed from inside the build-
ing and the crowd broke in panic
those who had been jamming the en-
trance disappeared in a wild rush for
safety faith her legs suddenly un-
steady stumbled toward the door of
ransomes campaign office when she
got it oden she saw mike harvey lying
on the floor pat ransome was stand-
ing against the opposite wall staring
at the shattered window and there was
a gun in his hand without looking at
her he said take care of him call
that other doctor and he sprang
past her out of the room

vi

aith knew as soon as she
knelt beside mike harvey
that he was dying the
floor was stained with blood
seeping from his chest and
he was breathing in hard
choking gasps she began to call shril-
ly for help but the men who had run
for cover were already streaming into
the room get dr adair she cried
hurry she looked around wildly for
help

  someones already gone for him
a man grunted and staring down at
mike he added looks like this fin-
ishes our reform government before it

got started ransomll be elected to a
noose

  out of the way a voice snapped
let the doctor in

  they shuffled back and white-haired
dr adair bent over mike fix up
some kind of stretcher he said take
him to my place ill have to operate
then hes- faiths voice broke
hes dying

  i dont know hes in bad shape
please leave young lady you
shouldnt be here

  someone led her to the door and then
the sunlight was spilling hotly over
her as she walked along the rough side-
walk mike was dying    and pat
ransome he had not looked at her
or noticed her when she found him
standing over harvey with a gun in his
hand if he had shot in self-defense
   but mike never carried a gun

  her steps slowed sharply and part
of the weight which had crushed down
on her when she saw mike lying on the
floor of pats office disappeared why
of course she told herself speaking
aloud tom knox did this thats
what he meant this morning if his
gang had killed pat it might have
ruined him politically but this way
is safe ransome will be tried for nuns
der

  she went on again more lightly
there was some way that she could
make the truth known not to anyone
in lawrence where every official took
orders from tom knox but she would
get word to washington would go
there if necessary

  the house seemed very quiet as she
entered but passing the door of the liv-
ing room she jerked to a halt a man
was turning away from the windows
moving toward her a tall man whose
eyes were the color of gray minted
metal she stepped into the room and
closed the door

 mike harvey may be dying and
everyone believes you shot him
yeah the expression of his face
did not change i figured on that
what are you going to do


marian ohearn

  several things but i couldnt leave
without seeing you

  youre leaving and then before
he could answer she rushed on why
did you have to see me

 he hesitated had his eyes really
changed were they clear and young
or was she once more imagining that
because i want you to know what i
said this morning wasnt true i dont
want to forget you i cant ill al-
ways remember faith and wish id
found you sooner

  she felt the blood leaving her face
and even her lips turning cold this
was good-by he was leaving getting
out of the territory before the law
could catch up with him and he had
not denied shooting harvey you
cant go she said her words just
above a whisper

 i have to for a lot of reasons
youre the biggest one it wasnt your
fault that i didnt know about harvey
i didnt give you time to tell me i
saw you and thought- he broke off
and once more the corners of his mouth
moved into a faint wry smile

 what did you think she moved
closer to him watching his face

 guess i thought we belonged to-
gether-something simple like that
it wasnt simple she could not
keep back the words maybe it was
right pat maybe thats how it should
be with everyone

  yeah except that it never is adios
maam he put out his hand and she
placed hers in it but then she was in
his arms which were holding her fierce-
ly against him his lips were fiery
music on her mouth and her racing
blood took up the song of his kiss yes
it was also magic the magic she had
sought

  when he let her go she whispered
no we were meant to be together
wait

  he shook his head and there was no
youngness or warmth in his eyes i
told you id always remember but the
trouble is i cant forget any part of it-
especially harvey

taiths father remaining unwill-
ingly in bed asked for mike half a
dozen times that day ill make him
realize im well enough to be up send
word to him please

  but anthony byers still looked so
white and ill that faith would not tell
him the truth instead she said mike
was too busy to look in on him and in-
sisted on his staying in his room

  evening arrived too slowly and twi-
light stretched over long-drawn-out
hours during which she kept hearing
pat ransomes voice saying i cant
forget any of it-especially harvey
while she was having a lonely sup-
per in the kitchen a boy arrived with
a message from dr adair saying that
mike was conscious and asking for her

  she went at once hurrying along the
narrow unlighted street to adairs big
frame home the elderly doctor an-
swered the door and told her smiling-
ly  looks as if well get him through
he led the way to a room at the rear
of the house and as he opened the
door his pleasant-faced wife got up
from her place at the bedside hes
sleeping again she whispered miss
byers had better wait she can sit here
with him

  they went out and faith took the
chair near mikes bed in sleep his
face looked younger and less grave
touchingly unguarded why couldnt
she have loved him or have given him
all of her love maybe he had part of
it and maybe that part would always
belong to him   

  there was a sound behind her the
door swung in and pat ransome en-
tered the room

  how did you get here i thought-
is he conscious he asked ignor-
ing her question i was hoping he
would be

  the man on the bed stirred restless-
ly and then his eyes opened he looked
at faith before his glance went to pat
glad youre here ransome come
closer so i wont have to shout

pat went to the bed and mike said
swiftly want to tell you while i can
man from blue river



-youve got to get away send faith
out of the room for a minute

  why- the girl began but then
she got up and walked out to the hall
shutting the door behind her

  pat came out a moment later and she
demanded what did he say does he
think you shot him

  ransomes glance was odd remote
and almost cold no he wants me to
get out of the country maybe ill take
his advice

  and as soon as the last word was
spoken he walked past her down the
hall toward the rear of the house as
he disappeared into the kitchen she
realized that he had entered the same
way

  she opened the bedroom door but
mike harvey was asleep and for a mo-
ment she looked down at him in be-
wilderment which was mixed with
anger he had sent for her but had
been more interested in talking to pat
ransome almost as if they had joined
forces against her

  dr adair glanced in and said this
has been enough of a visit for him
miss byers hes very weak

  he ushered her out the front door
and when it closed behind her she felt
lonely and shut away from life a
group of horsemen were pounding
down the street and at their head was
a deputy sheriff a posse starting the
hunt for pat ransome probably he
had been seen near dr adairs house
and the lawmen knew he could not be
far ahead of them if they caught
him   

  another line of riders was approach-
ing but these were moving at a walk
four men heavily armed with holsters
mounted on their saddles

  they reined in ahead of faith and
two of them dropped to the ground
are you miss byers the first rider
asked

  ye-es

  thats what i thought his heavy-
set body swayed forward one hand
clamped over her mouth and the other
arm lifted her from her feet

 vii

efore she could be-
gin to struggle she
was put onto his pony
and he stepped up be-
hind her digging in
his spurs the three
other men closed in around them and
they pounded down the road traveling
north within fifteen minutes they had
left lawrence behind and were enter-
ing a trail which led to the back hills

  how is it the man holding faith
shouted to a rider behind him
clear

  he took his hand from the girls
mouth theres no use yelling or
fighting sister were not going to
hurt you but you cant get away so
dont try it

  where are you taking me why-
youll find out later just keep still
and youll be more comfortable he
sent his mount into an even faster pace
and they roared toward the first dim
outline of the hills

  but a mile below they reined in and
waited at the side of the trail no one
spoke until the thud of hoofs broke
the stillness and a man rode out of the
brush

  mac he called

  yeah all here

  he rode up to them then and faith
saw that it was tom knox

  youre responsible for this she
told him you-

  hold it maam he said easily
theres nothing for you to be afraid
of and nobodys going to hurt you im
taking you to a nice comfortable cabin
where youll be all right for a few
days

  why whats this about if you
expect my father to pay you-

  he chuckled you ought to guess
the reason pat ransomes disappeared
and hes smart enough to get away
from ten posses but if he hears youve
been kidnaped-and he will because
hes got plenty of friends-hell come
back i know him when he comes


marian hearn

back hell walk right into the strong
arms of the law after that- he let
his words fade into another chuckle

  after that youll see hes sent to
jail for shooting dr harvey but
mike harveys not going to die thatll
make it harder for you wont it
maybe but accidents can happen
people might get so worked up theyd
take ransome out of jail and lynch him
even if the doc doesnt die this town
thinks a lot of young harvey

  she stared at him in amazed dis-
belief he was so sure of himself so
conceited about his own power that
he was coolly explaining how he in-
tended to cause another mans death

  when she was silent he told the
men well get going couple of
hours of traveling ahead

  they started on-only to pull in
again at once their hands jerking wild-
ly at the reins

  a tall figure was standing directly
ahead of them on the trail covering
them with two leveled guns and in
spite of the darkness faith knew that
it was pat ransome

  all right tom he called to knox
drop your guns and get down quiet-
like ive got that scared little killer
you sent to get harvey back there in
the brush hes all tied up and safe
and hes been talking plenty i caught
him an hour after the shooting dumb
to throw lead through a window
knox did not speak and the men
around him tensed their hands moving
toward their weapons

  ransome said dont go for your
irons boys if you do ill let knox
have it first better tell em tom
pat youre crazy weve always
been friends so lets talk this over
knoxs voice was actually friendly but
suddenly even as he was speaking he
flipped out his own weapon it ex-
ploded with a roar

  both ransome guns barked at the
same moment and knox went limp
for a second he was a grotesque soft
shape on top of his horse then he
slid sidewise out of the saddle

  the riders remained motionless their
hands still near their guns

  come on then pat told them soft-
ly start throwing that lead and you
wont have to worry about the law
the man on the lead pony muttered
hell get at least one of us and hes
right were through

  lets pull out the second man
growled theres no stake in this for
us now

  the rider who had been holding
faith in the saddle before him stepped
down and lifted her to the ground
then he got up again hastily and
wheeled his mount the others fol-
lowed driving their ponies to top
speed and suddenly the girl sagged
they were gone-and she was free

  pat she said weakly i think im
going to faint i never have before but
this must be the way it feels

  no youre not he reached her
in two strides and caught her arms
hold on to yourself do you hear
ye-es she swayed against him
and his arms closed around her
feel better he asked

  a little but dont let me go

  to her surprise he laughed she
straightened up forgetting her faint-
ness to look at his face this hasnt
been a very funny experience

  i was laughing at the idea of let-
ting you go-because i never will
she started to speak but he stopped
her words with his lips and even now
in the middle of the dark deserted
prairie his mouth was touched with
the thing she had sought the magic
she had almost missed

  but at the end of that kiss she said
then you wont remember mike you
see he broke our engagement

  i know he told me yesterday he
realizes things like this can happen and
he said you belong with me

  he said that she drew out of his
arms im so glad you and he ar-
ranged everything it was sweet of
him to give his consent and-

  shut up he said and kissed her
again
love is the loot

by cliff walters

things were so mixed up in rim valley
and in eileen clarks head that it was
pretty hard to tell friend from foe   
though she woke up just in time

aving struggled
through her first year
of school teaching on
stormy slope in a

ramshackle log build-

ming afflicted with a
leaky roof and winter drafts eileen
clark was grateful when her uncle
frosty clark had invited her to make
her home at the jy a hundred miles to
the south in rim valley yet in spite
of the month she had been here she
felt that she hardly knew this uncle
this squat-built blunt man with the
chill blue eyes

 on this evening frosty clark stood
on the ranch house porch and watched
intently a pair of riders coming down
the valley


cliff walters

  old jim got him all right said
frosty and nodded not without satis-
faction toward the sheriff jim bar-
clay who was bringing an elderly pris-
oner downstream

  eileens clear brown eyes held to the
oncoming horseman she looked at the
elderly sheriff tall erect rather pic-
turesque in his saddle then her gaze
focused on the prisoner a stooped
elderly shaggy-haired man whose feet
were encased in ill-made moccasins

  eileen said to her uncle fortune
seems to have followed you into this
valley you were able to buy out three
homesteaders and consolidate that land
into a very fine ranch and heres
moccasin shaw who refused to sell
his little place now hell- she hesi-
tated

 now what frosty clark asked
bluntly

  she didnt answer the two riders
were close the eyes of the prisoner
smouldering under heavy brows
burned at frosty clark and moccasin
shaw said youve baited a trap clark
youve sicced the law on me but youll
never get my little place

 baited a trap clark grunted
youd still be a free man shaw free
to haul beef down to willow grove
and sell it if you hadnt made the mis-
take of butcherin one of my yearlins
or maybe your mistake was in bein
caught-finally its hard to tell how
many of my yearlins have been-
just one id guess said old moc-
casin shaw one had to be killed
you know so youd have a fresh hide
to plant on my place but that place
aint goin to go by the boards go for
taxes so you can grab it no matter
what happens to me no matter how
many damned lies you and any of your
sneakin riders swear to theyll be
somebody livin at horseshoe springs
youre sellin out clark asked
that bothers you dont it shaw
retorted he looked at eileen who hav-
ing ridden past horseshoe springs a
couple of times lately had visited with
the lonely old man to her moccasin

said if you saved any money on that
school teachin job youd better hide
it and deep somewheres coyotes
have good smellers you know he
looked at clark again

  clark said to sheriff jim barclay
did you trail this crooked old meat
peddler down this way just so he could
cuss me out barclay

nope came the reply i just
wanted to tell you and your puncher to
be in town tomorrow for the hearin
whos takin over shaws place
clark asked

  how do i know barclay replied
well see you in town

 the riders continued their way
clark grunted went in the house
eileen sat down on the porch bench
and wondered if she hadnt better apply
for another school teaching job next
winter perhaps there was worse things
than winter wind blowing its glacial
breath between chinkless logs worse
things than unruly headstrong chil-
dren   

  hello there eileen beautiful
with a little start the girl turned to
see turk powell husky dark and very
handsome coming up the trail leading
from the bunkhouse its about time
your guardian angel went in the house
and allowed you some company youd
really enjoy

  she smiled its seldom one sees
handsome men who are so modest
wont you come up and sit down
as if you hadnt started to already
oh grandma he retorted smiling
how sharp your tongue is tonight
sharper than a skinnin knife

  id like to know she said and still
more sharply whose skinning knife
peeled off the hide that was found in
moccasin shaws possession the hide
of a jy yearling

 turk powell was suddenly sober
your uncle tells me youre pretty
much upset over this deal good gosh
dont blame me for not ridin range
with my eyes shut im paid to help
look after jy stock if i stumbled
onto a jy hide over at horseshoe
love is the loot



springs when i rode down there to
tighten a loose hind shoe on my horse
dont blame me for mentionin it to
frosty and dont blame him for hav-
in old shaw picked up and put where
he belongs

  im sorry turk said the girl sud-
denly contrite its just that old moc-
casin shaw probably wont have much
money to hire a decent lawyer with
you want to see him go free dont
you turk said then in a low voice
he added down deep in my heart i
wish the same thing i try to tell my-
self that i did right by reportin the
hide-findin to frosty that he was
payin me to look after his stock but
now i half wish id just rode back to
the ranch drawed my wages and rode
away from here not that i couldve
done that

 why not she countered
wouldnt the loss of one steer mean
much less to my uncle than the loss
of freedom means to old moccasin
a lot less-yeah it wasnt that
eileen it was the thought of ridin
away from you

  hold on cowboy you shouldnt-
i know it he answered and i
dont want to lose my heart any more
than you want old moccasin to lose
his freedom but i have i saw you
sittin on this porch a month ago and
since then- he stopped jaw set a
little then rose abruptly

  husky erect he stood there sil-
houetted for a moment against the
afterglow of a sun which had slipped
down into a notch of the valleys west
rim then he left the porch and headed
for the corrals watching him catch
and bridle his own sorrel horse eileen
heard shorty talbott the other jy
puncher call hey turk i thought
you wasnt goin to town tonight
ive changed my mind came the
answer today was payday wasnt it
what are we waitin for

  pretty soon two cowpunchers were
loping off and pretty soon two pairs
of spurs would be jingling into the
noisy saloon there would be drinks----

 eileen walked to the end of the
porch and thought youre not afraid
to ride bucking horses turk powell
but youre afraid to say the thing thats
in your heart something tells me ill
be gone from here as soon as school
starts next fall so turk powell if
youve got anything to say    somer
thing that maybe i want to hear you
say   

t was three nights later
before turk powell a bot-
tle in his saddle pocket and
leading a newly purchased
roan horse - a bucker he
hoped to enter in the con-
test in tall tree-returned to the jy
even then he didnt come up to the
porch where eileen sat

  he stood beside the corral and talked
to shorty talbott about the new buck-
ing horse somewhat lonesome and a
little irked eileen went in the house
nor did she even so much as look out
the window until she heard the excite-
ment down there at the corral

  the roan bucker had been saddled
now out there in the dusk he was
really wiping it up with a rider who
unable to match with his skill the fury
of those long high crooked jumps
was losing his balance after the third
jump-and crashing to the ground just
beyond the corral

  eileens heart leaped to her mouth
she had only glimpsed that rider be-
fore he went spinning down to the
earth now the roan horse was wheel-
ing was bucking back toward the fallen
man

 she raced out the front door and
down the porch steps just as another
rider a stranger hard of jaw and lean
came spurring around the corner of
the house he was pulling his gun as
he came and he fired at the roan out-
law now bucking back toward his
thrown rider

 the roan bucker squealed veered
away from the fallen man and plunged
to the earth himself then turk powell
-eileen realized now that he wasnt


cliff walters

the thrown rider-came running around
the corral at the lean bright-haired
stranger turk bawled who the hell
do you think you are shootin my
horse

  i think im dave mayland shootin
an outlaw horse before he kills my
young brother somebody had to stop
that killer-and its a cinch you wasnt
tryin very hard dave mayland rode
to the side of his brother a dazed
young fellow of about seventeen bent
over him and tried to help him to his
feet

 eileen could see then that the
younger maylands left arm dangled
limply -and his face looked tense and
white in the dusk

  take him in the house called the
girl

 ill take him to town-on his old
bay horse there replied dave may-
land his voice harsh flat but first ill
know how come he happened to be
twistin broncs for this tinhorn lay-
out

 he come along-from the horse-
shoe springs place he said replied
turk powell and wanted to borrow a
little coffee i told him id give him
five pounds of coffee if hed ride the
roan and he was game

 game dave mayland echoed
how did bob here know the roan was
a killer did you tell him that when
you was baitin a seventeen-year-old
kid into riskin his neck you neednt
answer you and the rest of the scum
around this crooked outfit wanted to
see anybody-anybody related to old
moccasin shaw-smashed all to hell

 are you drunk mr mayland
turk countered calmly

  not as drunk as you are

  good then we can talk business
start shellin out for that horse youve
just killed he cost me fifty dollars

  ill pay you off this way dave
mayland tall lean savage as a wolf
smashed a blow to the face of turk
powell who viciously retaliated with
a blow of his own

  then they went at it give and take

eileen gasped when a vicious blow
staggered turk a little she gasped
again when he nearly felled his tough
opponent with a smashing uppercut
dave mayland didnt go down how-
ever blue eyes glinting with fury he
waded into turk and punished him
with lefts and rights punishment that
was still being meted out when frosty
clark came running down from the
ranch house

 cut it out frosty bellowed
therell be no fightin here

  therell be a lot more of it if this
buzzard that aint quite as handsome
as he was a minute ago dont shell out
for the doctor bill on my brothers
busted arm    come on bob we
ridin to town id taken you with me
in the first place if id known you was
cornin down to this buzzard roost to
bum grub

  i didnt know the jy had it in for
us said the younger brother

 you know what they did to old
moccasin dont you theyll have us
in jail with him-if they have their
way they want the horseshoe springs
place to go by the boards remember
that

  are you payin for that horse you
killed turk powell asked

  try to collect

  all right maybe i will mr may-
land as long as youre goin to be
livin right handy here if i ketch you
alone out on the range-

  youve got it backwards came the
reply coyotes never chase men but
youll see me as soon as the doc in tall
tree hands me the bill for fixin this
kids arm and youll pay that bill one
way or another just like this thievin
layout herell pay moccasin shaw for
the time he spends in jail

  get off this place stay off frosty
clark ordered if that damned old
thief has brought some of his tribe
in here to scare the jy youd better
watch your step im not after horse-
shoe springs

 you tried pretty hard to buy it
once didnt you said dave mayland
love is the loot



well lets see if you get it old moc-
casin never had much money but what
he got he got honestly and some of
that he spent helpin to send me and my
brother here to school we happen to
know hes honest-which proves that
youre a crook mr clark or moccasin
wouldnt be in jail

  as the mayland brothers rode off to-
ward town turk powell growled
hell pay me for that buckin horse

 why did you let that seventeen-
year-old boy tackle such a killer as
that horse eileen demanded i dont
think it was a very sporting thing to
do turk but perhaps youre not quite
yourself tonight i dont know whether
dave maylands fists have made you a
little groggy or whether-

  do you spose turk wouldve paid
fifty dollars for that roan if he knowed
he was a killer inquired shorty tal-
bott

  dont try to defnd a whisky-drink-
in tramp like me shorty said turk
of course i wanted to see that kid
killed tromped to death by a killers
hoofs if theres anything i like bet-
tern the sight of whiskey its blood
he turned toward the barn and said
ill hook up a team frosty and drag
this roan carcass out in the hills that
is if your niece can trust me with
a team

 whats she got to do with it
frosty clark irked looked hard at his
niece who suddenly felt ashamed she
wished now shed remained at the
house first thing in the morning
turk you and shorty move that bunch
of steers down here from the upper
pasture the cattle buyerll be out
here pretty early tomorrow

  eileen went to the house and to her
room later she heard the creak of
the wagon turk was driving heard
the rattle of a log chain and knew a
roan outlaw was making his final trip
into the sage-covered hills swathed
in the haze of the starlight

  she went to bed but couldnt sleep
she kept seeing two men locked in
battle turk powell husky and hand-

some fighting for all he was worth 
dave mayland lean fierce cool taking
punishment and giving it somehow
eileen felt that had there been ten
turks to battle dave mayland would
have waded into them this tough
blond-haired man was made of steel
he might be whipped might be killed
but never scared and although the
girl dreaded the dark shadows of trou-
ble she could see on the horizons of
rim valley she was glad that moc-
casin shaws little place was being
guarded by such a man as dave may-
land

y	mid-morning
the following day the
cattle buyer and his
hired man were driv-
ing a bunch of young
steers toward tall
frosty clark was putting
in a heavy envelope fifteen hundred
dollars in cash he would have to go
to town he told eileen and deposit the
money if shed like to come along

  maybe i will she answered and
stay there two or three days id like
to make some inquiries about a teach-
ing job

  youd prefer that to living here
asked her uncle and sounded disap-
pointed id hoped youd like it here
eileen but i guess its just as lone-
some for you as it was for me before
you came i-i kinda thought that you
and one of the hardest-workin hand-
somest punchers ive ever seen would
hit it off bettern you do

  she flushed id never suspect you
of taking time out from your business
to become a matchmaker uncle frosty
mother used to tell me thats why youd
never married

  i guess i shouldnt blurt things out
the way i do he answered turk
seemed to think hed be inheritin some
money one of these days that he might
buy an interest in the outfit here i
just thought that-well-

  i see hell be more than just a cow-
puncher some day im glad to hear it


cliff walters

but im afraid that whatever i think
about him he isnt quite so fond of
me as he appeared to be at first lets
just forget it for a little while at least
that trouble last night upset everyone
it seems ill get into my riding togs
and-

  turk powell came riding up to the
porch then tipping his hat he said
im here to apologize to you eileen
for saying what i did last night and
to tell you frosty that the fence is
broke down in the pasture where you
keep the little bunch of purebred white
faces

  hell clark growled we cant
have them mixin with the range cattle
well well have to postpone the trip
to town eileen ill use the house for
a bank today i guess he started in-
doors

  anything i can help with turk
asked the girl

  an extra rider could help round up
them strayin purebreds all right
theyre already in the rough country
to the west of the pasture

  ill help then

  eileen hurried inside changed to her
riding clothes and was at the corral
almost as soon as her uncle was

  didnt turk wait asked the girl

  no time to wait now

  the girl and her uncle rode toward
the upper valley they were crossing
a ridge when eileen said look
she was pointing toward horseshoe
springs but there was no cabin there
now only a charred spot where it had
stood and half the corral was charred
wreckage

  before frosty clark chose to com-
ment on what he saw a rider came over
the ridge he was dave mayland still
stern of jaw and with the battle smoul-
dering in his blue eyes

  to clark he said i dont see you
sheddin any tears over what you see
clark i guess i made a mistake last
night when i said in front of you that
i was takin my broken-armed kid
brother to town those words were
arrows sped from the taut bow of hate

  hold on mayland clark growled
i didnt set no fires last night i was
at home and- well ask this girl
why bother askin her came the
reply she probably dont want her
rich uncle stuck behind bars-where
he deserves to be a lot moren old
moccasin shaw nope you ride to
town with me clark now

  i cant right now and i wouldnt
anyhow if youre pullin a trick of
some kind mayland to get me behind
bars-show me up as a cabin-burnin
crook and force me to drop charges
against your uncle-

  so you wont come to town eh
well youll come later

  my uncle didnt burn your cabin
eileen said sharply he was at home
all last night and this morning too
was he dave mayland answered
he touched spurs to his horse and rode
on down the valley

  come on eileen lets get them
cattle rounded up said her uncle
dont fret about mayland

  troubled the girl followed her
uncle the two of them were heading
into the rough country west of the
purebred pasture when again topping
a ridge frosty clark froze in his sad-
dle and pointed down valley eileen
stared gasped as she saw a cloud of
black smoke rolling up into the sky-
above the spot where the jy ranch
buildings were located

  dirty damned tribe clark spurred
his horse toward home with eileen
spurring after him but it was quite
a long ride the house was a roaring
inferno when the two riders were still
a mile away they could only spur
on and watch it burn

  my clothes all ive got cried the
distraught girl

  yeah-clothes her uncle yelled
what about that fifteen hundred
cash

  oh heavens she moaned she
hadnt thought about that

  once on the scene it was all eileen
and clark could do to save the barn
and other buildings toward which
love is the loot



breeze-whipped sparks were sailing
then turk powell his horse dripping
sweat came spurring down valley and
worked like a trojan to help

  frosty clark stared at the charred
remains of his ranch home he said
ill put dave mayland behind bars
for this and for the rest of his life
or kill him

 mayland turk echoed did he
do this

  yes clark growled

  you cant swear that he did it
eileen put in

 stop meddling stop tryin to
whitewash that crooked layout her
uncle exploded you didnt want old
shaw jailed when turk caught him
with the goods on him nor maybe you
dont know that moccasin shaw was
mixed up with a wild bunch of lootin
coyotes a few years ago one of that
bunch wind river doyle was caught
and wounded in shaws cabin at horse-
shoe springs doyle a killer holin up
there when-

 but about young mayland turk
cut in what makes you think he
burned your house

   cause he accused me of burnin
the horseshoe springs cabin then
he rode down this way

 you spose his cabins really
burned turk said or was it just
an excuse to-

  its burned all right clark said
i saw it but mayland couldve done
it himself so hed have an alibi for
this the cowman clenched his hands
is your gun and shortys in the
bunkhouse

 yeah turk answered and i
think its time we was takin those
guns some fresh horses and headin
along maylands trail well find him
all right

  so its going to be murder now is
it eileen spoke tensely a man is
going to be shot down without trial
stop meddlin her uncle shouted
he turned followed turk toward the
bunkhouse

  after an instants hesitation eileen

turned the slim gray horse she rode
into the willows fringing the creek a
minute later she was riding fast pick-
ing up the fresh tracks of a horse
traveling toward tall tree

 meddlin she said to herself
well if meddling can prevent mur-
dering  

ileen rode fast as she
followed the tall line of
trees which followed rim
creek yet she was some
little distance from the
ranch when rounding a
bend of the stream she came upon a
solitary rider he was staring at the
ground ahead of him and now turned
quickly and dropped his hand to the
forty-five slung at his hip

 you said dave mayland and
stopped his horse

  dont stop she answered ride
faster get to town as soon as you can
go to sheriff barclays place and
then-

 why he asked

 so you wont be killed-or have
to kill anyone else she answered im-
patiently my uncle and turk powell
are going to be riding down this valley
pretty soon too soon perhaps and
theyre carrying guns now oh if youd
gone to town-gone to the sheriff in
the first place instead of stopping to
set that fire-

  i didnt set fire to anything he
interrupted

  you can tell that in court she an-
swered youll stand a better chance
there than you will here in these hills
stay in town dont come back
whats been burned now he
asked

  the j y ranch house

 his narrowed eyes were suddenly
suspicious what kind of a trap is
this one i was goin to town but now
im not and whos that rider headin
for horseshoe springs way up there
he pointed to a horseman disappearing
from view

 how do i know she said


cliff walters

  ill find out he spurred his horse
across the creek

  you fool eileen shouted i tried
to warn you but- he was already be-
yond hearing distance tears welled
to the girls eyes this is what she got
for meddling the censure of her
uncle and the distrust of a man she was
trying to protect

  she turned her horse started home-
ward slowly she hadnt gone far when
she met her uncle and turk powell
turk said wheres that fire-crazy
mayland did you come down here
and warn him

  i told him to get to town-yes as
fast as he could she answered truth-
fully

  hell have to ride fast-if he ever
gets there turk answered come
on frosty

  the two men rode on at a fast clip
and eileen was grateful for the screen
of thickly growing trees which hid
from view the range beyond the stream
then she had reason to be still more
grateful sure that dave mayland
would make for town with all possible
haste clark and turk powell veered
off the road and headed across open
range for a distant butte around which
the road wound they thought ap-
parently that this would gain them a
little time

  eileen didnt ride back to the charred
ruins of the ranch house wondering
as to the identity of the rider on the
black horse whom dave mayland had
sighted she crossed the creek and
headed for horseshoe springs shorty
talbott the jy puncher had ridden
a black horse this morning was he up
to something and did he know some-
thing about the burning of the cabin
at horseshoe springs

  a little more meddling wont hurt
the girl told herself

  the girl was within a few hundred
yards of horseshoe springs when she
stopped beside a dense clump of cedars
to watch the movements of a man who
had ridden a black horse up there was
that shorty talbott

  get back outa sight said the voice
of dave mayland sharply as he spoke
he emerged from the cedars grabbed
her bridle bit and forced her gray
back a few steps who drug that dead
roan horse out in the hills last night

 turk powell she answered
why

  he didnt answer that he just said
thanks for makin your uncle and
powell think id hit out for town i
saw em dustin it that way im sorry
now i said what i did to you i
mightve known just by lookin at you
that youre as decent as you are
pretty

  is that shorty talbott up there at
the spring

  nope its a stranger to me i dont
know what hes doin up there look
at him pawin around that crevice in
the rim just below the place where the
cabin stood like a coyote huntin a
lost den

  what is he hunting he asked

  i wish i knew but well wait let
him find it if he can then well ride up
there

  that was quite a wait one during
which the girl and man talked in low
tones dave mayland denied having
set fire to the jy ranch house the way
he spoke that denial the way in which
his gaze met eileens made her feel
he spoke the truth

  im not here to fight and burn
houses he told her im here to look
after moccasin shaws place keep an
eye on his few head of stock hold the
fort till hes freed that old mans
honest eileen clark as honest and
generous as they come it was him that
sent grub money to my mother when
bob and me were little-and starvin
but your uncle aint satisfied with jail-
in moccasin hes got to burn his
cabin the only home the old mans got
or have it burned how long was turk
powell away from the ranch last night
when he drug that roans carcass out
to-

  theres turk now said the girl
excitedly and pointed to a horseman
love is the loot



wending his way among the cedars on
another ridge between the rimrock and
the one she and dave occupied

  yeah it seemed as if dave may-
land were bristling like a lean mastiff
but he made no move

  turk powell rode on dismounted
and crouched behind a huge rock jut-
ting from the ridge a position from
which he could watch the mysterious
man working over by the rimrock
suddenly that mysterious man-he had
disappeared into the rocky crevice
which split the rimrocks base-came
hurrying out he was jamming some-
thing into his pockets as he hurried
toward his black horse

  but he never quite reached the black
the gun in turk powells hand
cracked-and down went the little
man

  eileen gasped moaned of all the
cowardly acts

  dave had pulled his gun he was
watching turk powell cautiously de-
scend the ridge and move toward the
fallen man dave moved too and
eileen followed pretty soon the girl
heard the wounded man yell dont
shoot no more powell well split the
roll

  split-hell powell rumbled i
got to this range first frenchy it was
me that made it safe for loot-hunters
around here i got rid of old mocas-
sin shaw and was gettin rid of
his damned nephews i thought it
might take quite a hunt to find what
youve got in your pocket there

  its as much mine as it is yours
powell groaned the hard-looking lit-
tle man called frenchy i overheard
wind river doyle and boots ballan-
tine talkin about the cache same as you
did

  wind river doyle that name came
back to eileen now that was the out-
law her uncle had mentioned this
morning the wounded outlaw who
had been trapped at moccasin shaws
cabin evidently doyle hadnt want-
ed shaw to know that he carried loot
money or old moccasin might have

turned him in to sheriff jim barclay

 shaw didnt know doyle was an
outlaw accordin to wind rivers
story powell was saying to frenchy

  but nobody up on this range knows
what i am either well with this
money i can make love to a certain
pretty girl pour my heart out to
her

  at least let me get away with my
life powell frenchy pleaded

  i will like hell the gun in pow-
ells hand started to come up again

  better not powell called dave
mayland

urk powell whirled
as dave with his free
hand shoved eileen
away from him two
guns roared their noisy
defiance at each other
and sent echoes hammering at the rim-
rock eileen stifled a cry and dreaded
to look yet she did look and saw
turk powell lips twitching spin half-
way around by the impact of a bullet
that had raked across his left ribs
he swore tried to right himself and
whip his gun around for a second shot
at dave mayland whose left arm had
been furrowed by a bullet

  again dave shot and with the cool
fierce deliberation that had marked
with battle of fists with turk powell
this time powells gun fell from his
hand a hand that was useless because
the arm above it had been smashed by
lead

 good for you stranger said
frenchy who had already felt the
sting of powells gunfire

  dave paid no attention to that trib-
ute gun still lveled for action he
moved slowly toward powell who
handsome face pale and distorted with
pain now slumped on the ground

  so you made this place safe for
loot-hunters eh dave asked it
dont look too safe right now does it
before i take you to town though im
collectin-if youve got any cash on
you-for that doctor bill youre sposed


cliff walters

to pay he started ripping at powells
pockets

  suddenly eileen emitted a cry there
was no time to stifle a long packet of
money in an envelope had come into
view

  whats all this dave mayland
asked where did you make this
haul not punchin cows i hope
powell

 thats uncle freds money
shouted the girl now i know who
burned the ranch house and thats
why the pasture fence was torn down
-so my uncle couldnt go to town and
put that money in the bank

  the same gent set fire to this cabin
here said dave on the way up here
i stopped by the carcass of a roan
horse i could see where somebody
had unhitched a team and had rode one
of those horses in this direction you
might as well tell us about that yearlin
hide that got moccasin in trouble too
powell or will i choke the truth out
of you

  i planted the hide powell an-
swered what the hells the difference
who knows it now

  eileen turned to see her uncle walk-
ing around the half-burned corral she
called come here uncle frosty and
hear what happened

 ive heard enough and seen
enough he said flatly his frosty eyes
on powell why didnt you kill him
mayland when he gave you such a
good chance

  id rather have him talk like he
has and then spend the rest of his days
behind bars came the reply well
theres your money mr clark i-i
dont know about this loot that these
crooks have uncovered

 keep it mumbled clark you
sure deserve some reward for shootin
powell and besides- clark didnt
finish frenchy larue who had broken

	

out of the penitentiary a few days ago
had squirmed around in his agony to-
ward the gun which had fallen from
powells hand now that gun cracked
lead tore into turk powell who
rocked over and lay still

  turn about eh groaned frenchy
himself on the verge of death the gun
in his hand sagged to the earth and
his fingers relaxed

  eileen shudered turned away her
uncle came along before she had gone
many steps laid a gentle hand on her
arm and said thanks for meddlin
lady if blinded by powells tricks
id helped him kill dave mayland this
morning  

  promise me im really forgiven
she tried to smile but tears were in
her eyes something had melted the
frosty armor from this man there was
gentleness in his tone in his eyes now

  if you promise to live in that new
house were goin to build on the jy
he replied a house you can design
and make it big enough because-

  because what

  hey mayland he called moc-
casinll be cornin home as soon as we
get to town how about you helpin me
run the jy eileen wants you to

  well if she wants me to    dave
mayland was actually smiling a warm
friendly smile that did something to
eileens heart will you have a job
for my kid brother too after his arms
well

  sure clark answered the more
maylands the better from what ive
seen of em how about you eileen

  that goes for me too she an-
swered firmly

right out of the
movies he stepped
into judys life
would he walk out
again as quickly

judy of the
circle bar

by stephen
payne

o	judy he looked like
the average fisherman
from the big city-rub-
ber boots and creel a
slouch hat with flies
hooked around its band
and a soft shirt open at the neck with
sleeves rolled up as if to aid the wearer
in acquiring a coat of tan she had
come stealing up behind him as he stood
near the corral casting his line in the
clear stream he must have heard her
there for he turned and smiled and
took off his hat

 judy caught her breath he was
young and athletic with wide shoul-
ders and dark wavy hair such a fas-
cinating smile too tommy hargraves
couldnt have smiled like that if he

  practiced in front of a mirror for ten
years

 why hello young lady am i
dreaming or are you real

  judy couldnt help feeling pleased
but she must not let this very good-
looking stranger get his way by induc-
ing her to swallow such flattery

  she said i saw you drive your car
across the bridge where the willows
would hide you from the house i
listened to make sure and after i heard
you shut off your motor i waited until
you came down the river now ive
caught you fishing on our ranch
although he was still smiling the
young fellow looked a bit shame-faced
but i havent caught even one of your
wily trout and i did want a mess of


judy of the circle bar



them for my dinner a wistful glance
at the stream ive driven two hundred
miles to get here

  judy steeled herself to be cold and
hard and practical thats not my
fault you couldnt have helped seeing
the no fishing sign on our gate now
you must go

  but this is my first chance to get
into the mountains to camp and to fish
and to sleep in the open ive been
looking forward to it when my new
picture was finished at last i threw my
duffel into the old car and-

 your new picture judys voice
was filled with awe then you-youre
a movie hero

  the stranger started to reel in his
line in a modest way yes perhaps
youve seen my name-brant com-
stock

 brant comstock well she
blushed you see i hardly ever see any
pictures    but that youre an actor
does make a difference

  does it the smile had returned
and there was a gay twinkle in the deep
brown eyes both smile and twinkle do-
ing strange things to judys romantic
heart and now may i ask your
name

  its tudy forrest impulsively she
added suppose you catch that mess
of trout then suppose i cook them for
you you see since youre camping
alone and im holding down the ranch
alone if we can eat together well both
be less lonesome

 a jim-dandy idea but do you
mean to say miss judy youre alone
on this big ranch

  judy shrugged im seventeen and
theres nothing to be afraid of

  i suppose not but i cant imagine
your folks leaving-

  daddy and mother had to drive to
dawson on busines they know ill be
all right ive stayed alone before
you have judy surveying her
with frank admiration but if the
fishing goes well i may not get back
until evening that ok

  ok judy was radiant now its

settled well have supper together
adios

  not even feeling her feet touch the
earth she sped back to the house what
was this new and strange and wonder-
ful something vhich had come into her
life

  joyfully she carried in wood and wa-
ter she built a fire in the range and
made a cake and a pie what else
would they have for supper fresh
butter and fresh buttermilk would be a
treat for brant so judy churned al-
though this was onlv tuesday and the
churning was usually done on satur-
day

  she fed the chickens and gathered
the eggs she fed the pigs she corralled
the milk cows she watered and fed her
saddle pony torchy she had even
done the milking and separated the
milk when at last brant comstock ar-
rived

  though he was sunburned and bitten
by mosquitoes and gnats he was hap-
piness itself he called hi judy
just look at this catch twenty all
ready to fry i could almost eat em
raw

  ill bet you could you wont have
to do that    brant over there across
the bridge where you left your car isnt
a good place to camp why couldnt
you pull in here and pitch your tent
somewhere in the yard

  judy had told him she wasnt afraid
of being alone but all the same it would
be reassuring to have someone near
that is someone like brant comstock

  she noticed that he hesitated pinch-
ing his sunburned chin where whiskers
were showing their dark heads at last
he shrugged and she heard him mur-
mur i guess its all right fella theres
nobody around here to talk

  judy watching brant go for his car
thought with alarm there is some-
body mrs hargraves darn her scan-
dal-wangling tongue and dad prob-
ably asked tommy hargraves to come
to help me with the chores even
though i told him not to bother

  a minute later she was cooking the


stephen payne

trout she had biscuits browning in the
oven lima beans simmering in a pot
potatoes frying in a skillet she heard
the brown car chug-chug into the yard
and pull up beside the little old ice
house and brant had already pitched
his tent before she called come and
get it

brant ate like a hungry man thor-
oughly enjoying every bite when at
last pie and cake appeared he cried
why judy you shouldnt have done
all this for me youre a dream girl
meaning what brant her head on
one side birdlike would his answer
be disappointing it wasnt it was
exactly what she hoped he would say
the kind of girl a fellow dreams
about yet never hopes to find

 when the pie had gone the way of
all good pies she said you must
light your pipe brant

 his eyes were one great twinkle
why

 actors-the kind i like most-
smoke pipes and have their pictures
taken posing sort of like this striking
an attitude

  judy judy youre one continual
source of amazement and of delight
however i do smoke a pipe so here
goes    should the chin be up or
down a bit more get the exact pro-
file photographer    now about
dishes and other chores

  ive done practically everything ex-
cept dishes you can wash and ill
wipe and then mr brant comstock
youre to tell me all about your work
the dishwashing was fun but when
they were seated in the living room
with brant enjoying his pipe he dis-
appointed her id lots rather hear
about you judy-about your life here
but brant theres nothing here
nothing i know all about thats interest-
ing or romantic or thrilling its all so
dull and drab and humdrum

  i dont believe that for a minute-
not ranch life

  let me tell you about it so you can
see how stupid it is we-thats dad-
dy and mother and i-raise hay on the

circle bar in the spring we fix fences
to keep cattle out of our fields and we
start irrigating to raise the hay its
just one round of hard work from
daylight till dark

 but now daddy and mother are
gone to dawson to try to get money so
we can go into the cattle business if
we can everything will be lots more
interesting i like to punch cows i
ride down to the box four and the tu
lots of times and work with the cow-
boys get a big kick out of it and
they say i make a hand too

  i love breaking broncs and trailing
cattle im dippy over little calves and
most of all i love the roundups but
here at home we just raise hay when
its ready to cut we get a crew of men
to put it up in stacks you know i
help mother cook for the crew or i
run a sweep or a rake

  is that so dull judy

  dull brant its deadly only ex-
citement is if you have a bad runaway
i had a humdinger last summer got
thrown off the rake and dragged along
by its teeth if the rake hadnt bounced
up in the air i guess id have been a
goner   

  in the fall we fence the haystacks
then daddy sells the hay to some cow-
man who puts cattle in the fields and
when snow comes daddy feeds the hay
to the cattle the snow gets neck deep
to a tall indian and we wear out two
four-horse teams breaking trails to the
haystacks you must always feed the
cattle blizzard or no blizzard daddy
and i were out in a blizzard last winter
where we couldnt see even the wheel
team

  how did you ever get home

  oh the horses stuck to the trail
theyre real smart about that because
if they get off the trail theyre wallow-
ing in snow to their necks    once in
a while theres a dance and sometimes
we go to town all terribly exciting
isnt it

i think id find it so said brant
judy opened her eyes wider all ex-
citement and interest again she edged
judy of the circle bar



her chair around until she was facing
brant in the lamplight why you
were interested

  of course i was    and now ill
hit the hay good night

  judy blew out the lamp and sat for
a little while in the soft darkness a
smile on her lips and a warm glow en-
veloping her but everyone says the
course of true love never runs smooth
she told herself

he following morning
she was again walking on
air while brant helped
with the chores he
showed more skill with
ranch work than should
of a city fellow he even
insisted upon milking ornery the
bad-tempered cow who delighted in
kicking and jerking and for his stub-
bornness brant was kicked over milk
bucket stool and all

  he helped judy get the breakfast
and they had just finished the meal
when there was a chud of hoofs fol-
lowed by a metallic ring of spurs and
tommy hargraves was standing in the
open kitchen door

  judys frightened eyes saw brants
amused glance travel up the stocky
body of this self-important young man
tommy wore run-over cowhide boots
greasy overalls with a red bandanna
hanging half out of one hip pocket a
faded blue shirt in need of a visit to
a wash tub leather cuffs and a slouchy
black hat this hat he did not bother
to lift from tangled black hair which
framed raggedly a full round face with
too-small mouth and too-wide nose and
eyes that were little and dark and
mean

  judy instantly on her feet was in-
stantly on the defensive as well wh-
why hello tommy you neednt have
come i-im making out dandy
ye-ah i see you are tommy said
it meaningly and favored brant com-
stock with a slant-eyed look

  still with that amused smile brant
took the situation in hand introduc-

ing himself and shaking hands with
tommy im enjoying the fishing
here-and also judys hospitality
ye-ah i see you are repeating his
earlier words a city jake aint you
brant shrugged unconcernedly i
suppose i might be called that youre
a cowman i take it

 tommy swelled with importance
sure am you from the city com-
stock my mall want to know
tommys mother would indeed want
to know judy felt rage and rebellion
surging within her now why should
this-this lout have to appear at the
circle bar and spoil everything

  brant however seemed quite unruf-
fled thats right hargraves   
we-ell if im going to hook a mess of
trout for lunch i must be at it youll
excuse me

 brant was cheerfully whistling
theres a long long trail as he went
to his tent but judy felt no music
either in her mind or in her heart she
found her hands trembling as she
cleared the table

 she felt tommys eyes upon her
questioning suspicious condemning
your dad and ma gone said tommy
him and you all there is on the place
its none of your business and its
all right

  you just wait till my ma hears bout
this

  judys heart leaped into her throat
and choked her she knew how gos-
sipy mrs hargraves could twist even
the most trivial incident into the pat-
tern she wished it to take judy be-
lieved this womans wagging tongue
the most malicious thing in all the near-
by world

  tommy hargraves so very like his
mother was licking his lips as if al-
ready gloating over the promised scan-
dal there were a few terrible mo-
ments during which judy as if a night-
mare gripped her could say nothing
then she heard

  your old dad hates tourists city
jakes and fishermen but just the min-
ute him and your ma go away miss


stephen payne

judy takes up with a young city slicker
and-

  stop cried judy youre just as
nasty as your horrid old mother
youre-

 you slamming my ma

 oh i didnt mean that not the
way it sounded judy thought quick-
ly you see tommy the situation
isnt what you think it is at all i-i
have every right in the world to live
in the same house with brant com-
stock if i choose

  huh tommy looked slightly less
like a smug hypocrite what you
getting at judy

  brant is my husband

 having taken this plunge judy
thought triumphantly there will
that spike the guns of the gossips
but in another moment tommy was
hooting the idea that judy could have
been married so quickly after her par-
ents had left the ranch he demanded
proof

  and judy told a convincing story a
story based on the fact that during the
month of april she had visited her aunt
in the city-as tommy and the entire
neighborhood knew at that time she
had met brant comstock and they had
been married keeping the wedding
quiet because she was under age never-
theless daddy and mother had been
delighted and when brant had come
to the ranch early yesterday they had
welcomed him as their son

 but after tommy had mounted and
turned his horse toward the gate lead-
ing to the highway he threw a parting
shot well the wedding sure wont
be a secret no longer

  when she could again think clearly
judy asked herself with terrible uneasi-
ness i wonder if i havent jumped out
of the frying pan into the fire

  she petted the big yellow cat told
him her worries and received in re-
turn only the cold comfort of a com-
plaining meow the day dragged
past as if it never would end then
once again it was evening and the
chores were done and supper was all

ready except for frying the trout brant
would bring

  when he did arrive he was more sun-
burned more tortured by mosquitoes
and gnats than yesterday but he was
gloriously happy-so happy that his
mood transmitted itself to troubled
judy

vas over the dishes
brants pipe was
the living room
and judy were sit-
the big old kero-
i between them on
the table when all at once from out-of-
doors on every side of the log house
arose a most terrific din the blast of
a trumpet and a mouth organ the
tinny rattle of pieces of iron on dish-
pans and tubs the clanging of cowbells
and the wild whooping of many voices
all combined into an ear-splitting bed-
lam of noise

  brant dropped his pipe and threw at
the girl a strange startled glance
what the dickens

  what the dickens reiterated judy
marveling that her lips and tongue had
moved when otherwise she felt petri-
fied

  faces at the windows now men and
women girls and boys pounding on the
glass rattling the doors a stentorian
voice called

 hi there bride and groom open
up and give us a treat the cigars are
on you

 never had judy seen anyone look
quite so astounded as brant comstock
she sprang up and caught his arm
its a charivari she said in a hollow
tone oh brant and her eyes sought
him you must-you must act as if
were married and go through with it

  bu-but why judy its all a mis-
take

 no wildly they think- here
they are    oh hello mrs gates and
mrs bridger hello everybody how
do you do mrs hargraves you old
hell-cat hello tommy i could
choke you

upperi

washed
scenting

judy of the circle bar



  thus judy carried on a smile on her
lips her heart frozen with dread wel-
coming the neighbors the ranchers and
their wives their sons and daughters
their cowboys and ranch hands she
introduced brant to them all at once
my husband brant comstock every-
body

  she watched the young fellow with
only she knew what trepidation but
he played up to her lead he carried
out the deception magnificently like
the actor he was

  soon the living room was cleared of
its furniture and rugs old mort good-
speed turned up his fiddle and bert
dawson his banjo together they op-
ened up with turkey in the straw the
neighbors were dancing judy was
dancing with them one after another
square dances waltzes two-steps brant
was right in the thick of it apparently
having a grand time and how the
neighborhood girls sought for his fav-
ors judy felt pride she also felt
jealousy

  the gay crowd had brought refresh-
ments expecting the newlyweds to
furnish nothing except coffee and the
dishes time for the midnight supper
judy eating with brant as if all was
very right and proper-she strangely
silent and preoccupied brant talking
gaily making a hit with the shrewd
ranchers too even if he was a city fel-
low mrs hargraves bustling about
and boasting how she had been the
first one to hear the news and to spread
it darn her anyhow

  then at last the merrymakers were
gone at last judy and brant were
alone he seized her shoulders roughly

  judy forrest what was back of all
this

  judy shook herself free please let
me alone i cant explain now perhaps
i never can she ran to her room to
hide her hot shamed face in the pillow
and let the tears run unchecked down
her cheeks

  the bright july sun awakened her
for she had slept late very late when
she had thought she could never sleep

again in the bare and rather forlorn
living room she glanced through a
window and saw that brants car was
gone

 her breath caught in her tight
throat so she must face the music all
alone could she ever explain to daddy
and mother to the neighbors she
could hear tongues clacking could see
the sly glances the pointing fingers
she couldnt she wouldnt face this
gossip shed go far away from this
place away

  writing a note for mother and dad-
dy was the hardest thing she had ever
attempted it would take pages to ex-
plain and she didnt want to explain
anyhow finally in desperation she
wrote

  dearest daddy and mums

    i love you love you love you but i
  must leave home

                             judy

  after this judy took not the road
past the hg ranch where that horrid
hargraves woman and tommy lived
but the pass trail at length torchy
her pony was climbing the steep slopes
of the great mountain range when judy
heard a car roaring behind her

  torchy snorted and turned aside as
the car gained the crest of the ridge
and stopped a bare-headed young
man sunburned and badly bitten by
mosquitoes and gnats sprang out of
the car judy he cried and lifted
her from her saddle

 oh brant she choked you-
you followed me

 yes i found that i couldnt go
away and leave you loving you as i do
judy honey well make it real-that
fake wedding and the charivari and
well buy us a real cow ranch and set-
tle down shall we

  she clung to him all her cares and
all her worries magically erased erased
by the power of love well make it
real you mean it brant darling
and the pressure of his lips on hers
was the most reassuring answer he
could have given her

trail

by l lindley mulkey

like a hero in some fanciful i ale of
old boyd hanley flew from beyond
the horizon to iran taylors range

           right sunlight
flooded across low
hills as fran taylor
raced the snowy al-
bino down the little
valley and came to a
stop at its end red-brown curls
framed the girls flushed face sturdy
cords and high-laced boots garbed her
slim form with studied concentration
in brown eyes fran put the albino
through his paces walking on hind
feet kneeling playing dead an im-
pressive repertoire but fran had
promised colonel morehouse that
white arrow would be a high school
skyline trail



horse when he rode him in the wagon-
tire rodeo that fall

  a nice exhibition spoke a voice
from behind

  fran turned from the task of teach-
ing white arrow to pick up a handker-
chief with bared teeth a tall young
man wearing whipcords and leather
jacket stood at the foot of a small
knoll

  hes not for sale stated the girl
calmly

  the newcomers eyes twinkled nice
eyes thought fran with an innate
friendliness in their depths

  sounds as if youd had some offers
he commented

  about three a week whenever i
see an hombre stalking across the range
with a determined look on his face and
admiration in his eyes i know what
hes got in mind

  need that admiration always be for
a horse inquired the other gently

  crimson banners waved in frans
smooth cheeks it always has been

  then count this day an exception
plainly the young man was enjoying
her confusion im in the market for
a phone not a horse my planes
grounded over beyond that rise

  it was then fran noted the tiny pair
of silver wings on the lapel of his
leather jacket a flyer it developed
that his name was boyd hanley en-
gaged in range seeding with a second-
hand plane hed picked up at auction
two months before

  a cantankerous old lady hanley
chuckled i have to humor her a lot
but she scatters grass seed like no-
bodys business and i figure this jobll
cover the cost of a new plane when ive
finished

  fran had heard of the governments
plan to re-establish overgrazed range-
lands by means of airplane seeding
but she hadnt realized the project
extended this far north

  theres a phone at my lazy q she
offered youll see the buildings just
beyond the bend in the trail

  im not good at findin my way

around alone mock gravity marked
the flyers bronzed face you couldnt
-er-personally conduct me to that
phone

  frans lips quirked a dimple appear-
ing momentarily just follow the trail
you cant miss it

  but im a sky rider not a trail
walker if theres anything in this well
known range hospitality  

  there is laughed the girl capitu-
lating but some people take advan-
tage of it

 somehow the sunshine seemed
brighter the sky more heavenly blue
as fran and boyd hanley strolled
along the valley trail with white ar-
row following a magnificent animal
the albino slim-barreled yet power-
ful every line of him from arched
neck to flowing silver tail bespoke a
royal lineage

  first time i ever saw a pure al-
bino spoke boyd hanley glancing
back at the spirited horse

  pure whites are very rare and
then fran was telling of the day three
years before when shed found a weak
little all-white colt struggling in a
sand pit and had taken it home to hand
raise

  from one of those wild hill bands
i reckon surmised hanley i often
see em when im cruisin over the
breaks makes you a pretty valuable
horse i guess with all those tricks he
knows

  hes not mine any more said the
girl not since colonel morehouse of-
fered three thousand and laid the cash
on the line it meant paying up a lot
of debts and putting the lazy q in the
clear

  but you had other offers

  dozens but it wasnt only the
money most of the would-be buyers
were show people whod drag white
arrow from one end of the country to
the other for what they could make out
of him but colonel morehouse loves
horses his flying ms a regular horse
heaven he had to go east this sum-
mer on business and asked me to finish

training the albino ready for fall de-
livery

  they had reached the little lazy q
ranch house with its trim outbuildings
and pole corrals in that moment fran
thrilled with pride of ownership for-
getting those times when loneliness
lay like a pall on the little spread when
her feet yearned to dance with other
young feet when she longed for com-
panionship other than that of old pad-
dy mcgrew

  reckon theres another buyer for
the albino chuckled boyd hanley as
they reached the yard gate

  for the first time fran noticed the
two men whod come from the lazy q
barn and the two saddled mounts tied
near the corral

  ill go down and talk to them while
you use the phone she said its just
inside the kitchen door

  as fran continued along the path
she wished white arrow were already
in colonel morehouses big flying m
corral so shed be finished with this
matter of refusing would-be buyers
some underground telegraph of the
range had spread the arrows fame far
and wide    his beauty his spirit his
speed only last week thered been a
letter from a circus owner in chicago
others had come in person to the lazy
q their disappointment doubled upon
seeing the arrow

  the two men at the corral gate were
patently father and son possessing the
same long nose and beady black eyes
both wore shoddy range clothes with
lank dark hair showing below battered
stetsons their one difference was in
weight the father being heavy-set the
son of rangier build

  dark eyes lighted as they took in
white arrows high-flung head and the
beautiful symmetry of shoulders back
and withers

  our names felton carnival folks
showin in wagontire this week
spoke the older man we could use a
good hoss act in our program is the
albino for sale

  fran repeated the refusal which had

become almost a habit colonel more-
house owns white arrow now
reckon hed sell

  youd have to ask him about that
suddenly fran became aware of the
younger mans stare taking her in from
head to foot there was something
rapacious in those small close-set eyes
as if they saw below the modest neck-
line of her blouse color spilled into
her cheeks making them doubly lovely

 reckon weve come on a goose
chase jud spoke snide felton sour-
ly well be gettin back to town
without further words the two
mounted and rode toward the lazy q
gate

 a pretty pair boyd hanley had
come down the corral path and stopped
behind fran

 a pretty disappointed pair
shrugged the girl did you get your
call through

  i did that theyre sending me out
some oil from wagontire itll probably
take an hour

ll during the follow-
ing week as fran put
white arrow through
his daily practise in
the little valley north
of the lazy q ranch
house she watched for boyd hanleys
plane cruising back and forth across
the range invariably on passing he
dipped his wings in greeting and
fran would wave back her heart per-
forming queer antics in her breast

 it was wednesday afternoon that
paddy mcgrew man of all work on
the lazy q saddled a small bay so
fran could ride into wagontire for
the mail the little cattle town flaunt-
ed a holiday air with the traveling
carnivals tent pitched at one end of
the main street fran noted the outfit
as she came out of the post office and
wondered what part the feltons father
and son played in it

  like all such wandering troops they
showed only in the evening when folk
from the surrounding hills rode in for
skyline trail



a bit of fun fran was about to swing
aboard her bay and start for home
when she saw an old woman in faded
gypsy dress come out of the carnival
tent huge earrings dangled from her
ears but that which riveted frans at-
tention was a big snake coiled about
the womans neck the reptile lifted
its ugly head then slid like quicksilver
along its bearers arm fran moved clos-
er drawn by a sort of horrified fascina-
tion the carnival woman looked up

 you like my leetle pet she
smirked with a grin

  fran shuddered how can you stand
it about your neck

  ah but ees he not a pretty neck-
lace see how he glistens in the sun
the woman handled the snake deftly
to show off its colors but come you
shall see all of tanyas pets

 you-youre a snake charmer
questioned the girl a swift repugnance
in her eyes

  but yes for many years tanya
have love the snakes and they also have
love her the old woman turned and
lifted the tent flap come you shall
see

  tanya snarled a masculine voice
inside the tent

  the old woman stiffened a swift fear
in dark eyes

  tanya come here

  wait muttered the old woman to
fran and disappeared behind the tent
flap

  fran hesitated then suddenly came
that same snarling masculine voice
from inside you old hag the only
time people see them snakes is when
theyre payin for it we aint givin no
free shows

  a moment later tanya reappeared a
sullen fear in wrinkled face eef the
leetle lady come back tonight then will
i show my pets she mumbled

  no thanks you tell snide felton
ive seen all of his show i care to
without further words fran swung
aboard her bay and heeled him swiftly
down the street somehow the air
seemed cleaner away from that shabby

carnival tent and to think the fel-
tons had wanted to buy white arrow

  frans repugnance lasted until she
reached home shortly before sundown
old paddy mcgrew was puttering
about the lazy q corral brushing
white arrows satiny coat and patient-
ly waiting for supper paddy irish as
the proverbial shamrock with his gray-
streaked hair and turned-up nose had
been hired by fran as man of all work
but had delegated himself her guardian
as well

  that there range seeder was here
this afternoon he stated stretching
a diminutive five feet four to comb
white arrows flowing mane

color spilled into frans cheeks
you mean boyd hanley the flyer
yeah i reckon leastways he was
wearin a pair of them little silver
wings on his lapel

  a smothered pulse beat in frans
throat what did he want

 nothin much he hung around
about an hour watchin me exercise
white arrow said to tell you hed
stop by in the mornin old paddy
mcgrew gave the albinos coat a finish-
ing touch jest how much dyou know
about this here aviator miss fran
know about boyd fran started to
say that boyd hanley was the most ex-
citing person shed ever met then
changed her mind

  why-why i know he has a gov-
ernment contract for range seeding
and that he plans to buy a new plane
with the money he makes fran
paused what makes you ask
paddy

  i dunno the old irishman kicked
diffidently at a pebble its jest that a
purty girl without no father nor moth-
er to look after her has to be kinda
careful of strangers

  paddy in the role of mrs grundy
fran wanted to laugh but knew the
old cowhands concern was born of
loyalty and affection

  thats all right paddy you dont
need to worry about boyd hanley now
turn arrow into his stall and get


l lindley mulkey

washed up for supper ill have it
ready in a jiffy

  all in all it had been a disappointing
day for fran first that annoying inci-
dent of the snake charmer and snide
felton and then being away when
when boyd hanley had called per-
haps boyd had wanted to ask her to go
to the big mid-summer dance in wag-
ontire next week

  fran went to bed but not to sleep
the mid-summer dance there was
that pale green frock shed sent for in
the mail-order catalogue itd be here
in time pale green brought out red
tints in her hair and did something for
her eyes

ith the sun

o	bunked at
tie room off
stall hadnt
ran sounded
triangle a
second time and when the old man still
didnt appear went down the path to-
ward the corral it wasnt like paddy
to oversleep

 fran reached the corral gate and
then suddenly stopped a groan sound-
ed from over near the watering trough
the next moment she saw paddy mc-
grew lying in half out of the trough
with a crimson trickle of blood across
his forehead

 paddy paddy

  fran worked swiftly lifting the old
cowhand and laying him on the ground
for one terrifying moment she thought
he was dead then another groan passed
his lips fran rose and sped to the
house returning a moment later with
a flask of brandy a few drops forced
between paddys lips and his eyes slow-
ly opened

  miss  fran  white arrow

 white arrow a paralyzing fear
struck the girl

  gone    stolen gasped paddy
struggling for breath and then as
fran forced more brandy between his
lips the old man gained strength for
speech

  i was goin to bed last night then
remembered the water hadnt been
turned off here in the trough it was
dark when i come out and i didnt see
nobody around but as i bent down
feelin for the faucet somethin hit
me from behind i jest went numb all
over then a flash o white came
through the barn door    but some-
how i couldnt move or yell reckon
later i passed clean out

 white arrow stolen and shed
guaranteed the albinos delivery in an-
other month shed even spent the
three thousand colonel morehouse had
paid these thoughts raced like fire
through frans mind as she ran to the
albinos stall empty paddy hadnt
dreamed it all

 who you reckon it was miss
fran asked the old cowhand pulling
himself up with the watering trough
for support

  im not sure paddy but  
suddenly fran stopped remember-
ing her interrupted conversation with
old tanya snide felton had been in
the carnival tent and no doubt had
recognized fran had he tried to in-
sure her attendance at the night show
in order to make the stealing of white
arrow easier

  what is it miss fran exclaimed
paddy watching the girls white face

  that carnival outfit thats been
camped in wagontire it was them im
sure declared the girl snide felton
and his son were out here only last
week probably looking over the
ground on the pretext of buying

  fran had snatched her saddle from
the corral fence and thrown it on the
little bay shed ridden the day before
theres only one thing to do paddy
and thats to cut their trail before they
get out of the country they wont
travel the regular routes which means
theyll probably follow down sand
ridge and cross the alkali flats toward
the san simeon badlands

  but miss fran you cant tackle
them hombres alone ill go along
youre weaving on your feet pad-

ran was up w
but paddy wh
the barn in a lit
white arrows
come in yet fi
the breakfast
skyline trail



dy and in no condition to ride fran
had already mounted turning for a last
word but you can make it to the
house and call sheriff bronson in
wagontire tell him to cut down goose
creek and meet me in the flats well
pick up feltons trail there

  seems i ought to go along miss
fran

  no paddy its more important for
you to stay here boyd hanleyll stop
by this morning with his plane tell
him whats happened and ask him to
cruise over the country between here
and the san simeons he can spot
white arrow from the sky where itd
take a ground force a month in that
rough country

tefore old paddy could remon-
strate further fran set spurs to
flanks and went racing through the
lazy q gate old paddy roused brush-
ing a gnarled hand across dazed eyes
fran had said to phone to sheriff
bronson and at the rate she was travel
ing bronson wouldnt more than have
time to reach the flats and meet her
paddy turned then suddenly stopped
a slow stricture catching at his throat
there in the damp dirt at his feet
showed a bright gleam of metal the
next moment he stooped and picked up
a pair of tiny silver wings

  so it had been hanley there by the
watering trough last night hanley
whod cracked down on him from be-
hind paddy knew a sudden cold rage
hanley in cahoots with that crooked
carnival outfit playing up to fran sos
to give snide and jud felton a chance
to steal white arrow probably that
story about a government seeding con-
tract was all hooey and hed come
wingin in this mornin all mealy-
mouthed and innocent to further throw
em off the track but hanley wouldnt
be dealing with fran this time han-
leyd find paddy mcgrew and sheriff
bronson waiting with guns once
theyd clipped that birds wings theyd
soon catch up with his pals

  sheriff bronson was in his office

when paddy phoned whats that
he shouted above the buzzing of the
rural line that albino stole ill be
right out hold everything

  as paddy hung up the receiver his
old jaw set implacably he oiled up his
forty-five then went out to the front
porch where he could watch down the
section line road for the sheriff it was
a clear morning bright and fresh with
dew sparkling like jewels on the mead-
ow grass yet paddy mcgrew saw none
of it his thoughts being too engrossed
with what lay ahead boyd hanley
snide felton and jud felton a dirty
trio of scoundrels whod plotted to
hornswoggle a fine girl like fran

  and then all at once paddy mcgrew
stiffened there came the powerful
hum of a motor overhead as boyd han-
leys plane zoomed into sight making
for the little valley north of the house
so hanley had come to call on fran
again with an alacrity born of fury
the old cowhand hitched up his gun-
belt and set out on the valley path

  the flyer was coming in for a land-
ing skimming over the smooth ground
he brought the plane up into the wind
then glided to a stop paddy rounding
a last bend in the trail saw hanley
climb from his cockpit as the propellor
lost momentum

  somethin sort of romantic about
them flyers the old cowhand mused
grimly reckon fran couldnt help
failin half in love with him

  boyd hanley was striding swiftly
down the trail with wind lifting dark
waving hair handsome even old
paddy mcgrew must admit that yet it
detracted nothing from his determina-
tion

 stop right there hanley he
snapped forty-five whipping up and
start reachin for them clouds
paddy what in hell boyd han-
ley froze gray eyes wide why all the
gunplay

  as if he didnt know hanley was
sure a good actor all right no wonder
hed taken fran in

  im holdin you prisoner hanley


l lindley mulkey

leastways till sheriff bronson gits
here

  prisoner well ill be hanged
you will be all right snapped
paddy  less you loosen up mighty
quick and tell sheriff bronson what
them pals of yourn have done with
white arrow

 the albino what-

  as if yuh didnt know he was stole
last night growled the old irishman
caustically

  stolen

 you know damned well he was
snapped paddy patience at an end
and you neednt act so carnsarned
innocent whats more if any harm
comes to miss fran while shes trackin
down them felton coyotes ill settle
with you myself law or no law

  boyd hanleys gray eyes narrowed
you mean frans trying to catch up
with white arrow

 exactly snapped paddy mcgrew
and if you think youll git a chancet
to warn snide and jud felton youre
mistaken sheriff bronsonll be here
any minute to take you into wagontire
and youll stay right there in jail till
we git white arrow back

  boyd hanley suddenly straightened
gray gaze fastened on a point beyond
paddy mcgrews shoulder but theres
fran and white arrow now he ex-
claimed just rounding the corner of
the lazy q corral

 paddy mcgrew turned and in that
moment a hundred and eighty pounds
of corded sinew struck him paddys
gun exploded harmlessly into the
ground then for the second time in
twenty-four hours he went out like a
light

  a horse and rider pounded through
the lazy q gate leaving a plume of
dust in their wake sheriff bronson
swiftly the flyer picked up paddy mc-
grews limp body and dumped it into
the rear cockpit of his plane a quick
turn of the switch and propeller the
engine roared hanley slipped into the
pilots seat and the next moment was
skimming across the valley in a clean

take-off higher and higher the plane
lifted circling the lazy q buildings
then zooming westward out of sight

hen fran left the
lazy q she headed
toward a low line of
hills that lay like
blue haze along the
southern horizon
here the country became rough and
broken with scrub juniper and pine
covering the higher slopes

  two miles farther on the hills
merged into the alkali flats a shim-
mering old lake bed from some pre-
historic age here a vast unwrinkled
sheet of gray alkali dust recorded ev-
ery track left by man or beast and
spread them like a pattern for all others
to read fran cut a wide circle across
the flats and finally found what she was
looking for wagon tracks accompan-
ied by two ridden and one led horse
they came into the flats from the north
yet at a different angle than she her-
self had followed

  fran cast a swift glance in the direc-
tion of wagontire but there was no
sign of sheriff bronson perhaps he
hadnt been in his office when paddy
phoned in which case shed better
ride on in order to cut down the fel-
tons lead when sheriff bronson
reached the flats hed see where her
tracks merged with those of the carni-
val outfit and follow pronto any west-
erner could read that sign with his eyes
shut

 fran knew she was making good
time grimly overhauling the more
cumbersome outfit ahead the bright
sun wheeled like a golden disk across
the sky topping the zenith then drop-
ping toward the west still fran kept
on prodding the little bay to faster
pace now and then she glanced back-
ward along her trail but when after-
noon shadows lengthened across the
hills there was still no sign of sheriff
bronson

  the tracks of the carnival outfit
showed fresh now fran knew they
skyline trail



couldnt be more than an hour ahead
her firm little chin set as she pulled
her sixgun from its holster and made
sure it was fully loaded dusk overtook
the girl in a shallow valley cut by
deep arroyas snide felton and his out-
fit were still traveling west straight
toward mule river ford beyond which
theyd be safe in the san simeon bad-
lands

  for years those badlands had been
a favorite hiding place for thieves and
rustlers there were countless hide-
outs tiny springs in oasis-like ravines
where a small gang could hole up in-
definitely so well hidden they need not
fear the law

  darkness came down swiftly yet still
fran kept on and then suddenly she
jerked the bay to a stop some distance
ahead through screening trees she
caught the glimmer of a campfire the
girls heart began to race she couldnt
tackle that camp alone but she might
slip up under cover of darkness and se-
cure white arrow while the others
slept

  fran tied her bay among scrub juni-
pers and crept forward the pounding
of her heart a clamor in her ears the
top of the covered carnival wagon
showed against a dark backdrop of
trees between it and the fire moved
old tanya busy at supper prepara-
tions but that which riveted frans
gaze was snide felton at the front of
the wagon where white arrow and two
other horses munched grain from nose
bags felton busy with paint can and
brush was covering the arrows beau-
tiful white coat with drab gray

  frans lips tightened so that was
why the outfit had risked a campfire
this first night felton needed its light
to effect that camouflage from a dis-
tance or the air white arrow would
soon be just another horse his coat
blending with surrounding rocks and
brush

  a good thing shed discovered fel-
tons trick thought fran she started
to turn but suddenly a hard blunt ob-
ject prodded the small of her back

  lift em hissed a voice as a hand
clamped on her gun

  fran froze so intent had she been
on snide felton that shed forgotten
about jud

  come along the latter chuckled
exultantly pushing her toward the fire
hey pa look whats caught up with
us

  snide felton jerked erect pale eyes
flaring so he spat you alone
girlie

  shes alone snickered jud i
been scoutin round the camp like you
said finders keepers eh pa

  fran swung around brown eyes blaz-
ing you dont dare keep me pris-
oner

  whos a-goin to stop us sneered
snide felton reckon well turn you
loose to bring the law after us

  the girl was about to flare back to
tell him that sheriff bronson was fol-
lowing her that tomorrow boyd han-
leys plane would be scouring this coun-
try from the sky and then she
clamped small white teeth into lower
lip better to keep still better to sub-
mit peaceably and wait

  that night she lay in the wagon box
one wrist linked to old tanyas the
other to the heavy wagon wheel fran
slept but little her thoughts busy with
the morrow and that moment when
sheriff bronson or boyd hanley would
discover the carnival outfit traveling
toward the badlands even with white
arrow camouflaged boyd would inves-
tigate and signal their location to
bronson

  it was noon of the following day that
the feltons halted in a deep arroyo
with old tanya making coffee over a
little oil stove in the back of the wagon
not since that first night had snide
felton risked a fire

  while they were on the move fran
rode in the wagon jolting over rocks
and ruts but at meal time she was
allowed to walk about and help old
tanya under the steady surveillance of
snide and jud feltons eyes there
was something in the latters envelop-


l lindley mulkey

ing stare that sent a chill through
frans heart

  thanks sweetheart he whispered
once as she handed him a cup of cof-
fee you n me are goin to git better
acquainted once we hit the badlands

  frans brown eyes hated him while
a swift fear wakened in her breast
why hadnt sheriff bronson come or
boyd hanley

 a sudden staccato hum broke
through the girls thoughts a plane
those others in the camp had frozen
to attention all eyes fixed on the sky
and then the plane circled into view
sunlight glinting on silver wings
tears started in frans eyes her throat
ached boyd shed know that old
crate anywhere

  swiftly the plane came on flying
fairly low did she dare signal boyd
fran caught at the bright scarf about
her throat but in that moment snide
feltons pale eyes met hers

  frans hand dropped it didnt mat-
ter she thought boyd couldnt fail to
see them now he was at the upper end
of the arroyo and now directly over-
head fran vatched breathlessly for
that dip of his wings his invariable
greeting to her but that signal did
not come the plane continued on a
steady even course passing overhead
and on toward the southwest

 boyd hadnt seen them or if he
had hed figured the covered wagon
and horses were some sheepherders
camp the girl turned and saw snide
and jud felton exchange a cryptic
satisfied glance

a n overwhelming worry claimed
fran as the outfit once more got
under way yet surely boyd would
come back if he didnt    but fran
thrust the thought away

  all afternoon they jolted over the
rough trail stopping at dusk for sup-
per snide and jud felton tended the
horses while tanya lighted the little
oil stove fran watched with bleak
despairing eyes all at once the old
woman turned pointing to the little

tank on the stove then to a five-gallon
oil can in the wagon

  empty you fill she said gutter-
ally setting her box of matches on the
tail-board of the wagon

  the girl rose to obey lifting off the
stove tank and unscrewing the cap on
the five-gallon can and then suddenly
every nerve in her body tightened out
of the southwest came the unmistak-
able hum of boyd hanleys plane
frans heart leaped then sank like a
leaden weight if boyd couldnt see
them at noon hed never spot them in
the dusk

  a moment and the plane would be
overhead suddenly an idea leaped
full-formed into frans mind she
dropped the oil tank its contents gush-
ing forth upon hard shale a match
next from that box on the tail-board
a swift rake against the iron wagon
wheel and fran cast it blazing into
the spilled kerosene

  a column of flame exploded upward
into the dusk fran scarcely felt snide
feltons fingers biting deep into her
arms scarcely heard his curses her
face was tipped up eyes straining to
catch boyds dipping wings signaling
that hed seen but that wing dip did
not come for the second time that
day fran watched the plane sail swift-
ly out of sight

  crawling hours of darkness sleep-
lessness despair fran lying with her
wrist linked to that of old tanya shud-
dered at the thought of the morrow
by noon theyd reach the mule river
ford once across it she must resign
herself to jud feltons love-making
with its ultimate hateful climax one
against three she was entirely at their
mercy

  snide felton roused old tanya at
dawn twenty minutes later the outfit
was again moving forward fran felt
beaten whipped swaying there atop
the wagon seat if only she had her
gun    could die quickly cleanly but
jud felton carried it in his belt a
mute symbol of his power

  it was mid-morning when the outfit
skyline tfcail



reached mule river a shallow sluggish
stream winding between steep sand-
stone bluffs beyond lay the san
simeon badlands mysterious sinister
mile on mile they stretched disappear-
ing in distance snide feltons face
wore a satisfied grin holed up in those
hazy canyons he could take his time
about disposing of the albino as for
the girl well jud needed a wife

  as the wagon moved down a steep
cut to the ford something in fran
seemed to wither and die paddy and
sheriff bronson had failed her but
that which hurt most was boyd shed
been so sure so certain hed come
when she needed him in that moment
all life seemed as ugly as those bleak
ravines beyond mule rivers murky
waters

  jud felton spurred up beside the
wagon nice place over there to
honeymoon he leered nice and-
he didnt finish for suddenly a voice
cracked through the midday quiet
lift em you scum youre covered
frans agonized gaze jerked upward
there on the bluff above the ford stood
two grim figures paddy mcgrew and
boyd hanley jud felton went for his
gun but in that moment boyds forty-
five spat fire jud slumped from his
saddle even as snides and old tanyas
hands lifted and then boyd was leap-
ing down the bluff disarming and ty-
ing the feltons while paddv kept them
covered from above

  fran

  boyd there at the wagon wheel
reaching up and then suddenly fran
was in his arms her slender body
shaken by sobs boyd carried her down
to the waters edge and gently bathed
her flushed tear-wet face

  youre all right dear they didnt
hurt you

  no no choked the girl oh boyd
i thought   

  that i didnt see you yesterday
noon and last night

  you-you didnt dip your wings
i was afraid to signal and maybe
warn those varmints better to take

em by surprise boyd smoothed back
frans red-gold curls tenderly you
see after i kidnaped paddy   
paddy

  yeah chuckled boyd softly old
paddy got the idea it was me whod
conked him there by the lazy q wa-
tering trough he even had sheriff
bronson primed to nail me when i
landed but when he said youd gone
out on white arrows trail i knew
there wasnt any time to waste in jail
tryin to convince em of my inno-
cence

  but paddy exclaimed fran
whatever made him-

  he found those little silver wings
of mine there by the watering trough
but when i got him up in the air i
talked some sense into him id lost
those wings in the carnival tent when
i took in that show night before last
reckon snide felton found em

  and planted them there by the
trough

  he probably figured on killin two
birds with one stone surmised boyd
you see felton had tried to talk me
into joinin his show do stunt fiyin
but after i met you that day in the
valley i didnt want to leave the range
till i knew if-if i had a chance

  a-a chance boyd whispered
fran breathlessly

  to sign you on as co-pilot    for
life sweetheart

  frans misty eyes and trembling up-
turned lips were boyds answer an
answer that was rudely interrupted by
paddy mcgrew

  hi boyd here comes sheriff
bronson straight on the course you
laid him reckon we can turn this out-
fit over to him now

  good boyd answered then to
fran that leaves you and me free to
take the skyline trail home sweetheart
my planes in a little flat downstream
will you sign on

  oh boyd will i whispered
fran once more surrendering soft lips
and this time there was no interrup-
tion

leaves from a cowboys sketch book

by walt mead
prairie girl

er name was ann
reilly but at some
of the community
gatherings they
called her little
annie rooney a
pretty little thing she was with wavy
brown hair and the dancing blue eyes
of the irish and always laughing
even at herself just a mite of a thing
too one hundred and five pounds of
happiness for all her twenty years
she was really nothing but a child and
so poor that a little gingham dress
from the dust-covered racks of clay
banks dilapidated general store
looked to her like the gown of a fairy
princess

  her family were hard pressed to
make ends meet with eight hungry
mouths to feed and all the drought
had taken its toll and the family were
clinging desperately
to what little they
had left it seemed
to have hit them
harder than most
as is the way with
some families any-
thing they turned
their hand to seemed
never to pan out just
right misfortune
stalked them at ev-
ery turn

 then fortune
smiled upon ann in
the buxom form of
mrs davis who real-
ly wore the trousers
for the two dot
outfit she needed a
girl through the busy

season and ann was so breathless with
excitement and the prospects of earn-
ing some money of her own that she
could scarcely accept above a whisper
five whole silver dollars a week only
they called them cartwheels then why
that could buy a girl like ann almost
all the beautiful things in the whole
world including the two-dollar gold-
tinted locket and chain that had been
gathering dust for months in clay
banks forlorn general store window

  so ann packed her few paltry be-
longings in her mothers battered old
cardboard suitcase and went to live in
the big rambling white house that
overlooked the yellowstone and which
old man davis had built when as
he put it he was in the chips he
was far from being poverty stricken
even now though mother nature had
whittled him down some and the ex-



perience rankled
but he still held to
a half-dozen riders
and a buster in the
breaking pens

as for ann the
poor girl didnt
know how to act
there at first after


cowboy lore



sleeping three in a bed as was the case
at home suddenly having a big spacious
bedroom ail to herself proved too much
even for a girl with her happy disposi-
tion she cried herself to sleep the
first night-tears of happiness mingled
with a goodly slice of homesickness as
well even a dugout can be home

  it was only natural that ann should
come to know jeff best who was work-
ing the breaking pens he often
strolled up the path leading to the
house for a cup of coffee leaving sev-
eral three-year-olds in the corral to
chew on snaffel bits with a chance to
think things over jeff had a way with
horses and some said with women too
though i dont know about that at
least he was handsome and dashing
enough to stir the hearts of most wom-
en i thought

  hed been places too mexico the
argentine and had even cowboyed
some over in hawaii he knew all
alaska and mining to hear him

  mrs davis sniffed at that one and
remarked i never knew a cowpoke to
do a hard days work in his life jeff
quite unabashed made it clear that it
had been something of a lark at the
time and he wasnt lookin fer work
leastwise not a shovel job

  mr davis in the background as usu-
al would often look upon jeffs empty
cup after he had departed and remind
martha that some day she might be a
mite too flip with the fellow and hed
up and quit to which mrs davis
would reply let him the woods
are full of horse fighters but she
knew otherwise

  it was all very thrilling to ann her
face would go all pink and her eyes
shiny when she poured his coffee she
even mustered up enough courage to
ask mrs davis if she might try her
hand at a two-layer chocolate cake jeff
had made the remark that it was really
the only kind of cake hed ever given
a rip for reminded him of his moth-
er hed said

  shed been watching him work his
youngsters from her prim perch on a
top rail when hed said it with his
head tilted back in that challenging
way he had his eyes crinkled in a
smile and ann had blushingly told
him that it was her favorite cake too

  jeff kept right on with his work and
his coffee and ann continued to please
mrs davis with her culinary though
it didnt take a sharp woman like mrs
davis to see how events were shap-
ing up quite well she knew what was
going on in the girls heart

 no one claims to know to what
lengths the courtship of the bronco-

buster might have gone even mrs
davis was left in doubt in fact things
happened so suddenly that it was sev-
eral days before people could adjust
themselves to the fact that jeff was
gone and apparently for a long time
at least thats what the grim-looking
man with the star had said would like-
ly be the case though he didnt state
specifically the reason and no one
asked him

listens in on a conversation-this one be-
tween the men she met on the range and

so he dolores and roy rig up a scheme to
learn more from the hanker

  sampson is persuaded to drive dolores
home to her uncles ranch and on the way
she cleverly allays any suspicion he might
have that she has linked him to the plotters
she met on the range they are interrupted
by bess huggins now a widow and after
roy again telling dolores to keep away
from her man after bess tears on samp-

from southern california to stay with her
uncle

 bill granby crippled but mentally
vigorous owner of the double bar x in
wyoming she straightway meets and likes

 roy pelgren owner of the neighbor-
ing lazy nine roy has been depressed be-
cause color blindness has barred him from
the air corps and because his girl bess
huggins jilted him for a lieutenant but
knowing dolores sends his spirits soaring

 all is not well on wyoming range a
sabotage ring is systematically destroying
cattle bill granby is bemoaning his help-
lessness when his son jerry who is on
the wild side comes home drunk and an-
nounces that pike the foreman is also
drunk-in the howling coyote saloon in
hurricane gap

  unknown to her uncle dolores starts for
hurricane gap after pike on route she
eludes three men whom she overhears plot-

ful as this is dolores plays up to him until
they reach the ranch but is unable to learn
much from him

  roy and dolores now realize they are
madly in love and plan to be married the
next day meanwhile roy rides off to his
range and dolores her uncle and maria all
take much needed naps while the girl is
sleeping in the porch hammock diego orie-
tra creeps up dopes her with a hypodermic
needle and absconds with her to southern

her see roy again and that in any event
diego must be thwarted in his traitorous
plans she wrecks the car both diego and
dolores are thrown out onto the sand of

chapter xxiii

wheres dolores

ill granbys ex-
hausted nerves kept
him in a stupor of
sleep until supper
time he was finally
wakened by the per-
sistent shaking of a brown wrinkled
hand and marias shrill voice

go way vamouse avanti he
opened one eye and glared at her then


marie de nervaud

shook himself wider awake at her terri-
fied expression

  what in hells the matter now he
growled getting himself hoisted up on
one elbow he wrinkled his forehead
trying to make head or tail of the tor-
rent of spanish then straightened in
alarm as he caught on to the main
theme of her tirade

 gone dolores isnt here my
god i wish that girl would stop pull-
ing a disappearing act shut up for
gods sake let me think

  his final yell brought maria to a
trembling silence but she still kept her
imploring hold on his arm a blind
instinct to save himself from a repeti-
tion of the scenes he had gone through
last night with maria made him calm
his excitement and hide his ovn alarm

  he nodded reassuringly si si
bien-si si

  maria drew a long breath and asked
a question which he gathered to mean
did he know where dolores was

  again he nodded with a soothing
si-si manana-

  the terror went out of marias eyes
and she gave a great sigh of relief
bill motioned her to go back to the
kitchen and let out a stentorian call
for jerry

  maria shook her head shrugged and
threw out her hands nadie nadie
not back yet eh bill granby
frowned but still motioned maria away
when she had finally backed out of the
room he let out a relieved whew
and settled back on his pillows to re-
view this new development

  nadie he muttered an echo of
marias last word that must be no-
body reckon that means pike hasnt
showed up either damn it all im
hanged if ill spend another night
alone with that screeching hyena

 a gleam of common sense broke
through his despairing rumble of oaths
there was no point in letting himself
get in the state he had been in last
night dolores had said the sheriff was
coming out he had showed up evi-
dently and wanted her to go in town

with him she had probably left a note
somewhere

  he was about to shout for maria
then stopped himself no sense start-
ing that up again if he got the idea
across to her that he wanted her to
look for a note shed fall to the fact
that he didnt know where dolores was
and the screeching would begin all
over again

  once more bill gave way to a pic-
turesque vocabulary that ranged from
curses on himself for not having a
telephone to curses on jerry and pike
for not getting back reverting finally
to the one sensible solution which was
that dolores had gone to town and left
a note that he couldnt find until jerry
or pike or some of the outfit came back
to get him out of bed bill resigned
himself to his inevitable role of in-
action

  he ate the supper maria brought
him then dropped off to fitful sleep
by the time morning came and there
was still no sign of jerry or pike
bills philosophic resignation had about
reached the end of its rope he mo-
tioned to maria to put down the break-
fast tray she brought him

  hi get me out of this damn bed
and into my chair

  to his grateful surprise maria
proved to be stronger than she looked
by the process of much gesticulating
hauling and pulling she managed to
get him into his chair

  now bring me that tray on the
porch ill wheel myself out

  maria nodded her understanding
picked up the tray and went out ahead
of him bill wheeled his chair through
the living room eagerly scanning every
possible place where a note might have
been left

  acute disappointment swept over
him at not finding any but he reso-
lutely reasoned himself out of the
growing anxiety that beat on his brain
it couldnt be long now before dolores
would show up or somebody he could
send after her if she didnt

  he was just finishing his breakfast
wyoming senorita



when the welcome sound of hoofbeats
came from the pines another minute
and a slender rider in blue jeans could
be seen winding through the trees

  bills thank god changed to an
ejaculation of dismay as the girl came
out into the open and headed for the
house bess huggins what in hell
was bringing her here

  instinctive caution narrowed bill
granbys eyes as bess pulled her sweat-
ing horse to a halt he had never had
much use for bess and had less than
ever since she had thrown roy over

  she made no effort to dismount but
called an excited hi bill wheres
dolores

  bills eyes narrowed still more
shes not here right now what do
you want her for

  not here bess was plainly star-
tled at this news where is she
search me bill studied her nerv-
ous excitement gone off for an early
morning ride i reckon

  which way did she go ill ride out
and meet her

  she might have taken any of a doz-
en trails bill was anything but help-
ful whats the excitement what
do you want her for

  i-ive got to see her bess was
obviously nonplussed at this turn of
events i- she hesitated then start-
ed to dismount ill wait for her
make yourself at home bill said
dryly itll probably be a couple of
hours or more

  oh i cant wait that long bess
burst into a gasping little sob a
terrible thing has happened bill roy
has had an accident i-i dont know
what happened but i found him there
at the lazy nine hes delirious and
keeps calling for dolores i - im
afraid he might die if she doesnt come
to him will you-will you tell her the
first minute she gets back

  wait a minute bills first start of
distress at this news was quickly super-
seded by suspicion i dont see where
dolores comes in she hardly knows
roy

  thats what you think bess
flashed out then leaned forward in her
saddle her eyes filled with tears and
herbreath coming fast im going to
be frank with you bill i know you
and all roys friends have it in for me
but ive paid for what i did my hus-
band was killed and ive come back to
roy i dont believe he really loves
dolores but hes got a crush on her
all thats beside the point now
though she ended wildly dolores
has got to come to him i flared out at
her yesterday but she isnt the kind
to hold that against me youll tell her
to come to the lazy nine wont you
tell her to come as fast as she can
make it

  ill tell her what you say bill
granby answered his face a non-com-
mital mask sure you wont wait and
see her yourself

  i must get back to roy bess let
another sob break through then
wheeled her horse and made for the
pines

  for sometime bill granby stared at
the spot where she had last disap-
peared just what is she up to i won-
der he mused uneasiness surging up
in him at this new situation that
whole story sounds darn fishy im
hanged if ill pass it on to dolores

  a groan broke off the soliloquy
when was he going to have a chance
to pass anything on to dolores or to
keep anything from her for that mat-
ter

  marias sudden appearance brought
an almost welcome diversion from the
groaning anxiety of his thoughts he
made out from her excited questioning
that she wanted to know how soon do-
lores would come now that manana
was here he gave a soothing string of
si sis that he was far from feeling
and finally managed to get rid of her

  again the morning silence fell heav-
ily around him to be broken at last by
the distant clang of the ranch gate be-
ing shut and the chug of a motor the
fervent thank god that escaped
bills lips as he recognized the sheriffs


marie de nervaud

flivver through the trees was no empty
phrase

  weak with relief he moved as the
car came toward him then fear gripped
him once more why wasnt dolores
in the front seat yvith tom

 wheres dolores he cried he
had to repeat his hoarse question twice
before he could make the sheriff hear

 whats that tom crawford
stopped short one foot on the ground
the other on the running board

 what did you say

  my god i said wheres dolores
didnt you-

 wheres dolores the sheriff
echoed what do you mean isnt
she here

  with one bound he was up the steps
do you mean to say she isnt here
he ripped out an oath that puts me
on the spot all right so shes vam-
oused

 what the hell are you talking
about bill granby roared she
hasnt vamoused somethings hap-
pened to her i thought of course that
shed gone back to town with you yes-
terday afternoon

  yesterday afternoon it was tom
crawfords turn to roar shes been
missing since yesterday afternoon
why didnt you-

 wait tom-wait bill breathed
heavily and put his hand to his heart
it isnt going to help to yell well
only have that maria on our necks
let me get this straight didnt you
come out here yesterday afternoon
i couldnt make it the sheriff an-
swered i told dolores i expected to
come but then i got delayed at all
events i had the word of honor of
this precious niece of yours that she
wouldnt leave the ranch until i did
come this morning i got the report
on the gun those were her finger-
prints all right not that i think she
was the killer he added at bills
stricken look i dont but itll be a
hell of a job to prove it especially if
shes run away

  she hasnt run away i tell you

bill granby declared if she gave you
her word she would stay here she
would stay id stake my life on it
tom theres foul play here what-

 a yippee cut him short both men
turned to see roy coming pellmell
down the slope of the north pasture

 my god i knew all the time she
was lying bill ejaculated

 who was lying the sheriff de-
manded but before bill could answer
roy was charging up to them with a
joyful wheres dolores

chapter xxiv

gone

ted to roy as he
at a hard gallop
s must have passed
last saw that ranch
rch ever since the
yesterday when he
had turned to wave a farewell to do-
lores emotion and a heady elation had
flamed through him quickening him to
an intensity of living he had never
known before

  the sheer surprise and wonder of the
fact that dolores actually loved him as
he loved her keyed him to high exhila-
ration it wasnt all fairy tale this
business of love at first sight it could
strike you out of a clear sky as it had
struck him as thank heaven it had
struck dolores

 every minute of these strenuous
hours that roy had passed since he left
her had been permeated waking or
sleeping by dreams of her on first
getting back to the lazy nine he had
made himself snatch a few hours of
much needed sleep his last waking
thoughts had been the incredible real-
ization that the next time he went to
sleep in this room dolores would be
beside him

  the glory of this thought vied with
the glory of the sunset as once more
in the saddle he raced across the mesa
to the meeting place slim and he had
agreed on twilight had been deepen-

t see
came u
that yea
since he
house pc
moment
wyoming senorita



ing as he had finally caught up with
the milling herd it had been hard to
pull his thoughts back from the intox-
icating subject of dolores but roy had
felt a deep thankfulness as he saw his
cattle safely down from the upper
range

  slim had accepted roys congratula-
tions with a satisfied grunt reckon
were safe for one while i hope the
double bar x outfit has had as good
luck as we have

  how about my going over to see if
theyve made it down from the upper
range roy had suggested and slim
had readily fallen with the idea

  sure were all set now im sending
one of the boys back to the lazy nine
tomorrow maybe if the double bar x
is still havin trouble we could spare
him to help em out i take it youll be
stickin around the ranch for a while

  instead of the bitterness that this re-
mark would have brought to roy a few
days ago a glow of happiness had radi-
ated through him

  yeah ill be sticking around he
had gloated ive got to go to town
tomorrow morning but after that youll
find me right at the lazy nine for bet-
ter or worse

  slim had stared at roy as he had
given a happy guffaw at his secret joke
roy had continued to chuckle over it
off and on after he had left slim and
started for the double bar x ranch
slim would get the surprise of his life
all right when he came back to the
ranch

  good luck had stayed with roy all
that night of hard riding he had
guessed fairly well about where the
double bar x herd would be apt to
be and pikes welcome had been a
heartwarming reminder of the new and
close connection between the two
ranches

  golly roy but im plumb glad to
see you i was hopin like hell that
someone would show up sos i could
send word to the old man that were
ok another two hours and well have
the herd all safely down on the lower

range i was too short-handed to send
any of the boys back but you can tell
bill were practically out of danger
ill be glad to roy had answered
then asked has jerry showed up
jerry pikes disgusted grunt had
been answer enough i got troubles
a-plenty without addin jerry to em
roy was thinking of this now as he
rode up to the house and saw the fliv-
ver and the sheriff he hoped jerry
wasnt in a mess

  he pulled his horse to a halt and was
about to call out again for dolores
when he caught the expression of the
two men on the porch waiting for him
in a flash he was out of the saddle and
up with them

  whats the matter his heart sank
with sickening premonition whats
happened to dolores

  nothing we hope bills groan was
anything but reassuring pipe down
roy dont get that damn maria ex-
cited

  tell me bill roys tense low
voice begged where is she he
looked belligerently at the sheriff
dont tell me youve run her in
we dont know where she is tom
crawford began she was here yester-
day afternoon

  yesterday roy exploded for
gods sake dont tell me shes been gone
since yesterday and youve done noth-
ing about it what are you doing
here he turned fiercely on the sher-
iff get going

 where

  the sheriffs solemn question froze
roy in his tracks as he was about to
leap for his horse coldly tom craw-
ford added just what call have you
roy to be taking charge in this high
handed-

  what call have i roy cut off his
question with a hoarse anguished croak
didnt dolores tell you he looked
wildly at bill

  tell me what

  we were planning to get married
this morning she cant be gone bill
she cant he turned fiercely on the


marie de nervaud

sheriff wheres art sampson tom
have you checked up on him my god
why did you ever-

 art sampson bill granby man-
aged to produce a roar out of his stupe-
faction then lowered his voice with a
nervous glance toward the kitchen
what in hell would art sampson have
to do with it and what do you mean
married are you crazy or am i
i will be if we dont do something
about-

  now hold your horses roy the
sheriff put a restraining hand on roys
arm suppose we get this straight
were not going to gain any time by
going off half-cocked you say you
and dolores had planned on getting
married today kind of sudden wasnt
it

  ever hear of love at first sight
roy demanded well it was that way
with us i figured the sooner dolores
had the protection of a husband the
better and i was right my god im
going to town to see-

  she didnt spend last night there
the sheriff broke in i know that at
least not at the hotel as to art samp-
son i met him early this morning go-
ing to the station he said he was off
on a two weeks business trip

 and you let him go roy ex-
ploded

 just how could i have stopped
him the sheriff asked angrily but
roy drowned him out

  dont you see he might have kid-
naped dolores he might have her
hidden away somewhere and he was
establishing an alibi with you why
didnt you have a deputy follow him
let me get a word in bill gran-
by roared why do you keep harping
on art sampson just because he
brought dolores home- he broke off
with an excited exclamation by
golly seeing you two has driven bess
huggins clear out of my head ill bet
theres a clue there

  he broke into an account of besss
sudden appearance and of her yarn
about roy she was trying to get

dolores away from the ranch he
ended excitedly

  let me get this roys voice had
a steely ring bess said i was deliri-
ous and calling for dolores why-
after a moments musing he broke in
with an impatient theres nothing to
that just bess up to her tricks she
has it in for me and she probably
cooked this up to embarrass dolores by
getting her over to the lazy nine then
get even with me by spreading the word
that she found her there

  i dont think bess would have been
so excited at not finding dolores if
that had been all there was to it bill
granby disagreed she was plumb
thrown off her keel i got the feeling
she didnt want to leave a message with
me but that she didnt know what else
to do theres a clue there i tell you
im not wasting any time with besss
monkeyshines roy said decisively
my hunch is that weve got to track
art sampson he turned to the sher-
iff its ok to tell bill the whole
story now isnt it

  tom crawford hesitated then slowly
nodded i reckon it is in as few
words as possible he told bill the part
of dolores story that he had made her
promise to keep secret i thought it
was safe enough to send her out with
art so she could try to pump him for
more evidence we could use against
him especially with roy riding herd
on them my god ill never forgive
myself if-

  never mind about forgiving your-
self roy broke in what are we go-
ing to do you can telegraph ahead
and see if art got off at any station
cant you hes well enough known
unless he was equipped with some
disguise which i wouldnt put past
him the sheriff was beginning when
he broke off with a startled hello
whos this

  they all turned to see a horseman
come out from the pines he appar-
ently glimpsed the sheriffs flivver
almost threw his mount with a sudden
jerk to his haunches then rightabout
wyoming senorita



faced and made for the shelter of the
woods again

  its jerry bill exclaimed but not
before roy had done his own recog-
nizing of the flying figure even before
bill had the words out roy was off the
porch in his saddle and giving chase
it was a matter of minutes only when
by a clever outflanking movement roy
caught up with jerry and grabbed his
horses bridle

  let go jerrys voice broke on a
high adolescent squeak let go i say
im not going to see the sheriff im
not-

  still holding the horses bridle with
one hand roy reached out and caught
jerrys upraised arm with the other
what do you know about dolores
kidnapping he shot out

  dolores kidnaped

  even roy had to admit that the hor-
ror and surprise in jerrys echo were
genuine the color drained out of the
boys face and his brown eyes grew
round and terrified

  you come back and come clean with
anything you know roy dropped
jerrys arm his mouth grim and his
eyes hard its damn well time you
ran into the sheriff

 he made no attempt to answer
jerrys hysterical questions but his
hand still on the bridle brought both
horses back to the porch at a fast trot

  i have a hunch jerry can give us
some clue about art sampson roy
declared sternly his hand on jerrys
arm as they came up onto the porch
spill it

  at the mention of art sampsons
name jerry sagged abject terror was
in his voice as roy jerked him relent-
lessly forward

  no no i dont know a thing about
art sampson i- his eyes grew wild
with the sudden memory of what roy
had said about dolores words which
obviously had been driven out of his
head by his subsequent fright do-
lores he gasped you dont-you
dont really think shes kidnaped
what do you think the sheriffs

voice was like the lash of a whip she
promised to stay here and she has
been missing since yesterday after-
noon if you had been home instead
of-

  jerry cut him short with a wild sob
dont ill tell everything i know-
everything if art sampson has done
anything to dolores i dont care what
he does to me ill tell everything i
know

chapter xxv

jerry comes clean

et some brandy
in the cupboard in
the living room
bill granbys voice
was tragic in its
depths of despair
but steady as a rock he put a hand on
jerrys arm where the boy had col-
lapsed in a chair beside him and was
sobbing hysterically im standing by
you jerry he went on no matter
what youve done but youve got to
come clean son right from the begin-
ning it may lead to our finding do-
lores

  some of bill granbys strength
seemed to flow into jerry and he made
a desperate effort to control himself
he gulped down the brandy roy
brought him shuddered then threw
back his head and looked straight into
his fathers eyes

  ill come clean he said art will
kill me-or worse-but i dont care

  it was a sordid story the beginning
of jerrys association with the sabotage
ring and the faces of roy and the two
older men grew even more grim as they
listened tom crawford made notes
from time to time of vhat jerry was
saying his excitement growing until
he could no longer hold it in

  by god ive got enough here to get
art sampson without needing any girl
to testify about recognizing his voice
you neednt worry about what hell do
to you jerry ill have him in a good


marie de nervaud

safe place until hes sent to a safer
oner

 when you catch him you mean
roy reminded him grimly go on
jerry do you know any hide-outs they
might have taken dolores to

  ive just come from their principal
one jerry answered she wasnt
there last night thats one sure thing
when i heard the sheriff was coming
out here he threw a frightened side-
long look at tom crawford i reck-
oned id better light out ever since i
heard bronc kenyon had been caught
with those papers on him ive been
about crazy i knew joe had given
those papers to bronc when joe decid-
ed to vamouse if the sheriff had read
them i knew too my goose was cooked
all right because my name was there in
connection with last weeks raid he
gulped when he saw his father wince
under these words

  i know he went on miserably i
know how you feel dad but by play-
ing in with art at least i was saving
our herds they would have gone the
way of the rest if i hadnt

  how do you figure that his father
asked

 why art sampson himself when
he got me in to this promised that the
double bar x herds wouldnt be raid-
ed he said i was protecting you by
playing in with him not only now but
later he said i was carving out a big
future for myself when he and his ring
took over the cattle industry of the
country after the war was over

  oh he did did he the sheriff
growled and you swallowed that

  youll have to swallow it too be-
fore long jerry retorted a flicker of
spirit showing through his abject des-
pair youre all living in a fools para-
dise figuring the u s is going to win
this war art sampson is smart enough
to know we cant win it and he has
lined himself up with the ones that are
going to come out on top after the
axis has beaten europe and asia to a
standstill-and art has inside informa-
tion that it wont be long now-well

have to do things their way theyve
got key men all picked out to take over
the different industries in this country
art sampson will handle all the cattle
ranges in wyoming and montana and
those of us who have helped him will
be-

  the damn swindling liar filling
kids up with stuff like that bill
granbys rage burst all bands of con-
trol id like to get my two hands on
him

  shut up bill the sheriff or-
dered tersely what more did he say
jerry

 he said helping to end the war
quickly was being more patriotic in
the end than dragging it out he said
the sooner there wasnt enough for our
army to eat the sooner they would
stop fighting he said-

  i dont give a damn what he said
this time it was roy who broke in
wheres dolores my god every min-
ute were talking-

  youre right the sheriff agreed
if youll just be patient a minute im
coming to that who was in the hide-
out jerry anyone

  jerrys face got even paler if that
were possible yeah he groaned
bronc kenyon was there he-a
shudder ran over him-they gave him
the third degree for being caught with
those papers on him

  they said if cal hadnt got the
papers back- jerry clapped his hand
over his mouth with a stricken realiza-
tion of what he had given away no
he didnt say that he cried wildly
he didnt say that im getting mixed
he said-

 never mind making anything up
jerry the sheriffs eyes gleamed
youve given us the name of the kill-
er of my deputy now go on

  i havent jerry sobbed but his
fathers stern voice cut off his rising
hysteria

  do you want us to find dolores
what else did bronc say

  dolores name had a bracing effect on
jerrys break in control ill do any-

i
wyoming senorita



thing to find her he gulped then
forced himself to go on with his story
they went farther than they meant
to with bronc i reckon he was in too
bad shape to go with them so they left
him there by golly jerrys eyes
started wide open with sudden blazing
excitement i remember now bronc
did say he overheard art and joe talk-
ing after they thought hed passed out
he said they had a special fancy job
on hand he started to tell me some-
thing about it then gave me a funny
look and shut up ill bet you he heard
them talking about dolores

  roy was hauling jerry to his feet be-
fore he had stopped speaking

  come on get going and take us to
that hide-out

  roy shouted to maria who came hob-
bling out the door gazing from one to
the other of the newcomers with terri-
fied eyes

  bien bien roy soothed in answer
to her shrill cry of mia senorita
bien he repeated forcing a smile
got coffee cafe he pointed to
jerry and pan pronto

  get some bread and coffee in jerry
bill roy added as maria made for
the kitchen while tom and i bring up
some fresh cayuses at last weve got
something to go on

  there was little time for talking in
the next few hours while the three
men pushed their horses to the limit
in their race against time jerry stood
up under the strain better than roy had
expected

  you dont think the kid is leading
us on a wild-goose chase the sheriff
had asked once motioning roy to fall
back for a minute

 the thought of dolores danger
will make him play straight roy an-
swered positively he fell for her the
way the rest of us have his voice
was harsh and strained nothing but
her disappearance would have made
him come clean about art im sure of
that

  reckon youre right the sheriff
nodded once more roy and he

streaked up beside jerry urging him
to greater speed

  suppose art has come back jerry
asked once

  thatll suit me fine the sheriff an-
swered grimly ive got a sixgun for
the beginning of that interview and
handcuffs for the end of it how much
further jerry

  another half-hour or so jerry
pointed to a distant spur we round
that and come into the canyon from
this end it runs straight through and
comes out the east side so you can
reach it from hurricane gap too hav-
ing two exits makes it mighty con-
venient

  when at last they reached the land-
slide of shale they left their horses
and started the climb fifteen minutes
later they were up and heading for the
cleverly hidden entrance of the cave

  you go alone jerry in case any-
one else is there the sheriff whis-
pered roy and i will wait here where
we can listen in to what bronc says to
you

  look jerry paused miserably
am i puttin a noose around broncs
neck

  tom crawford shook his head hell
have to pay for his folly just as you
will both of you being such kids
though ill see it goes as easy as pos-
sible with you coming clean with what
you know will count in your favor a
whole lot

  jerry nodded straightened his shoul-
ders and pulled back the pile of brush

  a groan greeted his hi bronc
then a surprised oath

  you back so soon whats up did
you run into art or joe

  art jerry echoed i thought you
said he was heading for montana

  thats what he thought but he got
double crossed somewhere along the
line the dame didnt show up

  the sheriff grabbed on to roy just
in time to keep him from dashing into
the cave at this unforeseen announce-
ment

  what dame jerry asked


marie de nervaud

  hell i might as well tell you
bronc let out an oath why should i
help that torturing sampson bully to
get what he wants arts got his eye
on that california cousin of yours you
were telling me about

 how do you know

  roy and tom exchanged a glance of
approval at jerrys well acted excited
surprise then strained their ears to
hear every word

  i wasnt sure when you were here
before bronc went on i knew art
was after some dame and when you
was telling me about the spanish
beauty i kind of put two and two to-
gether but i figured there was no use
stickin my neck out so i kept mum
im ready now though to throw a mon-
key wrench in arts scheme

  what in hell are you getting at
terry demanded

  like i told you i overheard joe and
art talkin when they thought id
passed out joe was trying to persuade
art to let the girl wait until theyd
got the raids finished but art was
plumb burnin up with romance he
had it all figured out so hed be as safe
as a church it appears theres a girl
named bess who has it in for roy she
was crazy-headed enough to do any-
thing to get even-especially if it got
this other dame off the range so art
put her up to getting the spanish baby
away from your ranch this morning
and then joe and art were going to nab
her

  art had it worked out foxy enough
to make a point of havin the sheriff
see him on his way to the early train
and tellin him he was goin off to mon-
tana on business for a couple of weeks
then he was to rig up one of his dis-
guises board the train and get off at
the next flag station where cal would
be waitin with a horse for him he
laughed again breaking off with a
curse of pain

  go on jerry added his own curse

  well joe and cal were here since
you left the dame never showed up
joes fit to be tied because art wont

give it up but swears hell get the girl
tonight joe and cal went to tell the
other fellows the raids are off for a
couple of nights god but id like to
catch art sampson in a trap

  so would i jerry agreed excit-
edly we-

  and so would i

  bronc gave a frightened curse at the
sheriffs voice and sudden appearance
in the mouth of the cave

  whats more tom crawford add-
ed as bronc star-ed at him in speech-
less stupefaction we will

  bronc came out of his stupor to burst
into shrill hysterical curses at jerry
for bringing the sheriff there

  shut up bronc tom crawford
ordered its the luckiest thing that
ever happened to you that terry did
bring me to this hide-out were tak-
ing you into town with us see and
then were going after art sampson
but one thing i want clear or it will
go mighty hard with you is this the
truth what youve been telling jerry
about arts plans for kidnaping do-
lores and is it true that so far he
has failed to do it

  its true as far as i know bronc
stammered i only know what joe and
cal told me but i dont see why theyd
make up such a yarn for my benefit
they wouldnt roy charged in
and joined them he winced as he saw
the state of broncs feet then added
excitedly where-

  let me do the questioning roy
the sheriff broke in curtly you and
jerry keep still while i get this
straight you say bronc that art
plans a kidnaping tonight

  thats what joe said there was
no doubting that bronc was telling the
truth

  ok tom crawford waved roy
and jerry toward the opening of the
cave i want to talk to you two out-
side

once there he motioned them away
i dont want bronc to hear us he
led the way out of earshot of the cave
youre a prize dumbbell he turned
wyoming senorita

scornfully to roy just because youre
in love with dolores you dont have
to lose all your wits i dont want a
soul to know dolores has disappeared

i want art sampson to come there to-
night to the double bar x for her
and whats happening to dolores
in the meantime roy groaned i
dont give a damn about art sampson

i want to know what could have hap-
pened to dolores if art hasnt carried
her off my god we cant just wait-
he broke off suddenly staring at some-
thing bright on the ground under a
thicket then made a pounce for it
my god

  he straightened up his face drained
of color his hands trembling as he held
out a small gaudily colored match box
it was smashed down at one end but
still had in it tiny wax tapers

  the sheriff took it curiously
whats that

  dont you see roys voice was
scarcely recognizable there are only
two places you can buy those wax
matches spain or mexico diego is i
the one who has kidnaped dolores
his face hardened to an iron expres-
sionless mask im going after her
tom crawford seized his arm as he
started away from them wait a min-
ute roy you dont know-

  i do know roys voice was as ex-
pressionless as his face diego is the
only other answer if art sampson and
his gang are clear diegos taken her
back to california i am goins after
her

marie de nervaud

thing had gone completely haywire

  he could hardly remember reaching
his horse and heading for hurricane
gap his whole being had been head-
ed for one thing molded to one pur-
pose there had been room for neither
feeling nor thought beyond that one
must he must get to that remote
spanish california where dolores had
been spirited away from him

 in hurricane gap he went to the
bank and drew out all the money he
had in the two-hour wait before he
could get a train to the nearest airport
he tried to raise a loan on his herd
but with the scare about raids there
was no one to take him up on it

  once on the train no longer able to
resort to action in an effort to deaden
thought roy fought hard to put down
his fears and lay his course calmly
diego had about twenty-four hours
headstart roy tried to put himself in
diegos place to gauge his probable
procedure a car would be the best
bet for getting dolores away driving
day and night diego could reach the
monterey coast by tomorrow morning

  roy calculated next his own possible
time of arrival if he got a plane soon
after the arrival at the airport he could
be in san francisco shortly after mid-
night he could hire- a car and with
luck be down in that region about the
same time diego got there

  but there was no luck at the air-
port he met the devastating news that
weather reports over the rockies were
unfavorable and all flights had been
canceled

  never in his life would roy forget
that hideous night of indecision every
hour or so it was reported that the
weather might clear and the planes
take off if he abandoned the idea of
flying it would take him an endless
time to get there by train

  the last straw came when at last the
planes did begin to take off in the
morning because of the delay all
army officers who had been waiting had

the right of way over civilians in
helpless rage roy could only wait his
turn instead of midnight wednes-
day when he had hoped to reach san
francisco it was midnight thursday
before he got there

  again the nightmare of delay went
on because of the tire shortage no
automobiles were for rent for such a
trip after hours of search roy bought
a second-hand car and started down
the coast

  at the restaurant where he stopped
in monterey he was given directions
as to how to reach the alcadero del rey
ranch but the waiter was even more
specific with warnings to stay away

  its a hot bed of fifth column down
there he explained in answer to roys
questions those old spanish fam-
ilies have never admitted they were
part of the u s a were still gringos
to them germans have come up there
from mexico and there are plenty of
japs who slipped down there before
the great move away from the coast be-
gan just last week there was an at-
tempt to dynamite the one road that
leads down there they may have suc-
ceeded since then we dont get too
much news up here about whats go-
ing on the sheriff is fit to be tied try-
ing to keep an eye on things down
there

  roy wolfed down his food listening
with only half an ear to the warnings
as time went on all the outside world
became more and more of a blur to him
in the intensity of his fears and longing
for dolores

  thanks he nodded and paid his
bill i reckon ill push down as far
as the big sur anyway

  on and on impervious to the gor-
geous scenery to the massive cliffs and
the sparkling expanse of the pacific
roy pushed his way excitement rose
in him as his speedometer told him he
was nearing his goal

  about thirty miles more according
to what the waiter in monterey had

said and he would reach dolores
fathers ranch he cast an uneasy eye
to the west where the sun was about
to sink beyond the watery horizon he
would have preferred to arrive by day
light but   

  the curious formation of a rocky
point ahead caught his eye and he gave
a sudden whew at the sharp pitch
the road took beyond it speeding along
the level stretch by the beach he was
speculating on the width of that nar-
row ribbon flung up against the stu-
pendous cliffs when a great burst of
smoke puffed up to be followed by the
incredible sight of the road itself burst-
ing into the air the next second came

i	the deafening detonation of the ex-

 	plosion

  roy came to a stop gazing in in-
credulous stupefaction at a second
burst of smoke and rock and dirt there
was a second thundering roar then
silence broken only by the gentle lap-
ping of the waves on the beach beyond
the dunes that lined the road

   shaken and still convinced that he
must be dreaming roy got out of the
car and walked a short distance down
the road

   he had the feeling that the jagged
gapping crater pitted into the cliff
where a moment before a road had been
must be a mirage but the boulders
that continued to detach themselves
j from the edges of it and crash into the
ocean below dispelled this hope

   it was real a section of the road
was gone blown up before his eyes
the words doloyes had repeated that
she had overheard in the hotel bed-
room flashed to his mind right now
things down there are in a mess
dolores had reported art sampson as
saying she had gone on with some-
thing about a dynamite scheme   

   even while he was remembering roy
was running back to his car in feverish
haste he must get down to where the
road started the ascent of the cliffs
then he would have to forge his way

on foot behind that now impassable
wall of granite

  bitterness at the further delay drove
all thankfulness for his narrow escape
out of his mind heaven only knew
how far he dared push through this
wild unknown country at night he
would probably have to make camp in
one of the canyons if his hope of skirt-
ing around to the back of this first
rocky promontory and meeting the
road again proved futile

 with a groan roy headed his car
around one of the dunes on the left of
the road and drove it behind a cluster
of the gnarled pines there he locked
it and abandoned it plunging at once
up the shallow opening of a canyon
that widened out to a sandy triangle
with a thin trickle of water flowing to
the ocean

  the going at first was easy follow-
ing up the creek bed but as the twi-
light deepened the canyon narrowed
to a seemingly impenetrable jungle of
tough manzanita bushes and heaped
boulders after taking a header or two
on the slippery stones roy was forced
to accept the inevitable to push on at
night was the wildest folly it would
net him nothing but possibly a broken
leg if not a broken neck

  realizing that it was too risky even
to try to retrace his way back to the
car he picked out a fairly level spot
by the creek and prepared to spend the
night the exhaustion and strain of the
last two days made him relax in spite
of himself

  stretching out roy looked through
the maze of leafy branches above him
here and there the light of a star pene-
trated and brought him a momentary
comfort those same stars were shining
on dolores at least he was within a
few miles of where she must be
though diego had kidnaped her she
was better off than she would have been
in art sampsons hands

 panic pierced through roy at the
thought of the few hours he and dolo-

res had actually known each other
suppose it all seemed a dream to her
a wild bit of unreality that would fade
away once she was back in her own
environment

  memory of dolores lips against his
of the look in those deep eyes ban-
ished his sudden fear it wasnt time
that counted when a man and woman
came together as he and dolores had

 the hypnotic rhythm of the wind
through the trees and the soft envelop-
ing darkness lulled roys tired nerves
to a doze and then to deep sleep how
long he slept he never knew but all
his life he was to remember his awaken-
ing

  through his troubled dreams flares
of light brought him to half conscious-
ness and an excited foreigner jabbering
completed the shattering of his rest
he tried to sit up but found he could
not move nor could he see anything
through the blinding light that he
stared into

 a sharp commanding voice said in
spanish let him speak but first tie
him securely

  in spite of roys struggles against
the many hands holding him he was
rolled on one side and his wrists and
ankles were securely bound with harsh
horsehair riatas he was then jerked
to a sitting position with his back
against a tree before him he saw a
striking looking older man in black
riding breeches of a curious cut a black
embroidered bolero sort of jacket and a
broad black sombrero that kept his
eyes and forehead in deep shadow

  with him were several vaqueros who
stopped their chattering at the older
mans peremptory gesture and stood
back respectfully watching with ex-
cited beady black eyes while he spoke
to roy in slow stilted english

  what do you do here in this can-
yon

  roys impulsive desire to say it was
none of his business gave way to better
judgment at the expression of the



please mention newsstand fiction unit when answering advertisements
wyoming senorita



stern hard mouth which was all he
could see of the older mans face

  i am on my way to the alcadero del
rey ranch he answered

  there was a quick exchange of ex-
cited glances between the vaqueros but
not the least flicker of any change of
expression in the face of their leader
and why are you going there
roy hesitated while desperate al-
ternatives raced through his mind the
supposition had already come to him
that this man might be dolores father
himself on the other hand it might
just as well be diegos father or one
of the other of the ranch owners down
here who were in with the sabotage
ring not only his own safety but that
of dolores and heaven only knew how
many more might depend on the answer
he gave

  i have news from senor del rey of
his daughter dolores he said finally
his eyes fixed on that straight uncom-
promising mouth

  there was still no shift of expres-
sion no change in the voice that asked
what news

  that is for senor del rey roys
heart gave an excited leap as he took a
daring plunge are you by any
chance the father of senorita do-
lores

  again roy was aware of the excite-
ment running through the vaqueros
but if the senor shared it he gave no
sign as he replied

  i am asking questions not answer-
ing them-senor

  the sarcasm of that senor brought
home to roy how he must look for
days now he had not had his clothes

off nor had he even had a chance to
shave since that far away morning
which he had so joyfully anticipated
as his wedding day his momentary
confusion gave way to a quick burst of
rage at the ignominy of his position
blurring caution and common sense in
a gust of anger

  the spanish californian hospitality
seems to be mighty different from what
its cracked up to be he glanced
from his bound wrists and ankles back
to the black line of shadow through
which he could feel if not see keen
suspicious eyes studying him where
do we go from here

  the senor made a brusque gesture of
decision we will go i think where
you will receive still more of our span-
ish californian hospitality

  he spoke in spanish but roy was
quick enough to catch the trap that was
being laid for him he would be in a
far better position to find out what
was what if they thought he did not
understand any spanish

 he presented a blank face and
growled a disgusted i dont get that
lingo say it in u s a

  the senor repeated what he had said
in english then gave a brusque order
in spanish to the vaqueros

  once more roy felt himself mauled
by many hands at least he had the
satisfaction of hearing curses of pain
as the vaqueros tried to dodge his
thrashing about and left him a glanc-
ing blow and a stab of pain at the back
of roys head put an end to his strug-
gles and as far as he was concerned
to him for the time being

to he concluded in the next issue

bashful joe

he was just a bashful cowpoke
and a little bit homely too

 but when it came to punchin cows
 there wasnt much he couldnt do

 he could cut a calf out from the herd
 and hogtie it just like that

 then slap its owners brand
 on its hide in nothing flat

 he could ride the toughest bronco
 or bulldog the wildest steer

 he could draw his gun like lightning
 or yodel loud and clear

 but when it came to women
 this cowboy was a wreck

 so his pals said he needed a wife

 and theyd marry him off by heck

 but when theyd introduce him
 to a girl upon the street

 hed just get red and stammer

 theres a fella ive gotta meet

 the boys drove him frantic

 with their affairs for his heart
 till the bosss pretty daughter
 stepped in and took his part

 she was gay and friendly
 and always very kind

 and when hed blush and stammer
 she didnt seem to mind

 so soon he learned to love her

 and then they asked her pa

 now he makes those boys step

 cause hes the bosss son-in-law

out of the frying pan

my father sheriff of pensco county was
hated and feared by every outlaw in the
west but his most deadly enemy was matt
garson a notorious killer when garson
robbed the bank in pensco and left a
note daring dad to come and get him single-
handed dad took up the challenge but
although he didnt know it the men in
pensco formed a posse to ride after him

  my brother benny and i were alone on
our ranch the following morning when dad
pounded into the yard badly wounded with
matt garson and another hombre close be-
hind him as he collapsed at my feet before
the kitchen stove i saw why he had tried
to outrun them instead of shooting it out
his right hand was blown to bits

  snatching dads gun from its holster
benny challenged matt garson and his pal
as they rode into the yard they laughed
loudly in reply and it was plain to see that
they were coming in after dad benny
raised the gun and pulled the trigger a look
of amazed fury spread over the face of
garsons pal and he tumbled backward just
as garson sent a bullet into bennys body
as he fell he whispered dont let him get
dad sis then he lay still

  matt garson stood looking down at dad
as he lay unconscious on the floor slowly
he raised his gun in the distance i heard
the sound of many horses the posse was
coming but it would be too late to save dad
it was left for me to stop him i seized a
pan of hot grease that was sizzling on the
stove and dashed it into matt garsons face
he gave one agonized scream and i fainted

  both dad and benny recovered although
both were badly wounded matt garson

nell knew right from the start
that she loved this buckaroo
but she knew just as well
the senorita loved him too

the cowboy flirted first with nell

from each he stole a kiss

the senorita used her charm
and the cowboy sure fell

girl of pisces-feb -march 

born under a benign and gentle sign the
girl of pisces seems always to be serene
but this outward show of serenity conceals a
volatile temperamental nature she is sensi-
tively fond of art and beauty and her capac-
ity for detail inclines her to the more deli-
cate things of life

  she makes an excellent homemaker a fine
designer of clothes a conscientious com-
munity worker her large sympathies and her
strong beliefs make her invaluable in the war
effort she would excell in nursery work
that is attending the children of defense-
working mothers she has a natural way with
children and they respond to her quiet
charm too she would make a sympathetic
nurse and pisces meaning the sign of the
two fish gives her a nautical leaning and
often brings her extensive travels invari-
ably she is endowed with exquisite grace

  being cautious by nature and even in-
clined to be somewhat wary and afraid of
big chances the pisces girl has good control
of her own heart when she chooses her
mate she knows exactly what she is doing
and seldom falls into the emotional traps
that await her more impetuous sisters

  perhaps her most enviable trait is her abil-
ity to adjust herself to sudden changes in
environment she need have no fears about
changing her pattern of life she will be able
always to leave one mode of life and enter
happily upon another-a gift which makes
her particularly valuable to her country in
these days of sudden changes of life and oc-
cupation

  being almost tireless her energy and her
enthusiasm for whatever she is doing may be
excessive and-a word of caution-she must
learn not to overdo
