 skylark edward e srai orhn sctrnfitcfton stories hs cipts p meek uia p rtcr van drcwcr h imond hamilton august amazing stories always outside of things -thats where i was just twelve short months ago i just didnt have the
 cash that was all no
 theatres no parties no
 good restaurants no real
 enjoyment of life  was
 list getting by just ex-
 isting what a difference
 today i i drive my own
 car have a good bank
 account enjoy all the
 amusefnents i please

i couldnt get the good things of life

then  quit my job and found myself

how does a man go about making
more money if i asked myself
that question once i asked it a hun-
dred times

  i know the answer now--you bet i
know the way good money is made and
im making it gone forever are the days
of cheap shoes cheap  clothes walking
home to save carfare pinching pennies to
make my salary last from one pay-day to
the next one i own one of the finest
radio stores you ever saw and i get al-
most all the radio service and repair work
in town the other radio dealers send
their hard jobs to me so you can see how
 stand in my line

  but-its just a year ago that i was a
poorly paid clerk i was struggling along
on a starvation salary until by accident my
eyes were opened and i saw just what was
the matter with me heres the story of
just how it happened

  one of the big moments of my life had
come i had just popped the fatal ques-
tion and louise said yes i

  louise wanted to go in and tell her
father about it right away so we did he
sort of grunted when we told him the
news and asked louise to leave us alone
and my heart began to sink as i looked
at his face

  so you and louise have decided to get
married he said to me when we were
alone well bill just listen to me ive
watched you often here at the house with
louise and i think you are a pretty good
upstanding young fellow i knew your
father and mother and youve always had
a good reputation here too but just let
me ask you just one question-how much
do you make

  twenty-eight a week i told him

  he didnt say a word-just wrote it
down on a piece of paper

  have you any prospects of a better job
or a good raise some time soon  he asked

  no sir i cant honestly say that i
have i admitted im looking for some-
thing better all the time though
looking eh how do you go about
it

  well that question stopped me

  how did i i was willing to take a
better job if i saw the chance all right but

i	certainly had laid no plans to make
such a job for myself when he saw my
confusion he grunted i thought so he
said then he held up some figures hed
been scribbling at

  ive just been figuring out your fam-
ily budget bill for a salary of twenty-
eight a week ive figured it several ways
so you can take your pick of the one you
like best heres budget no  i figure
you can afford a very small unfurnished
apartment make your payments on enough
plain inexpensive furniture to fix such an
apartment up pay your electricity gas and
water bills buy just about one modest out-
fit of clothes for both of you once each
year and save three dollars a week for
sickness insurance and emergencies but
you cant eat and youll have to go with-
out amusements until you can get a good
substantial raise in salary

  i began to turn red as fire

  that budget isnt so good after all he
said glancing at me maybe budget no

	will sound better-

  thats enough mr sullivan i said
have a hearty i can see things pretty
clearly now things i was kidding myself
about before let me go home and think
this over and home i went my mind
in a whirl

  at home i turned the problem over and
over in my mind id popped the question
at louise on impulse without thinking it
out everything mr sullivan had said was
gospel truth i couldnt see anything to do
any way to turn but i had to have more
money

  i began to thumb the pages of a maga-
zine which lay on the table beside me
suddenly an advertisement seemed almost
to leap out at my eyes an advertisement tell-
ing of big opportunities for trained men to
succeed in the great new radio field with
the advertisement was a coupon offering a
big free book full of information i sent
the coupon in and in a few days received
a handsome -page book printed in two
colors telling all about the opportunities in
the radio field and how a man can prepare
quickly and easily at home to take advan-
tage of these opportunities i read the book
carefully and when i finished it i made
my decision

 whats happened in the twelve months
since that day seems almost like a dream
to me now for ten of those twelve months
ive had a radio business of my own at
first of course i started it as a little prop-
osition on the side under the guidance of
the national radio institute the institu-
tion that gave me my radio training it
wasnt long before i was getting so much
to do in the radio line that i quit my

measly little clerical job and devoted my
full time to my radio business

   since that time ive gone right on up al-
ways under the watchful guidance of my
friends at the national radio institute they
would have given me just as much help too
if i had wanted to follow some other fine of
radio besides building my own retail busi-
ness such as broadcasting manufacturing
experimenting sea operating or any one of
the score of lines they prepare you for and
to think that until that day i sent for their
eye-opening book id been wailing i never
had a chancel

  now im making real money louise and
i have been married six months and there
wasnt any kidding about budgets by mr
sullivan when we stepped off either ill
bet that today i make more money than the
old boy himself

  heres a real tip you may not be as bad
off as i was but think it over-are you
satisfied are you making enough money
at work that you like would you sign a
contract to stay where you are now for the
next ten years making the same money if
not youd better be doing something about
it instead of drifting

  this new radio game is a live-wire field
of golden rewards the work in any of the
 different lines of radio is fascinating ab-
sorbing well paid the national radio in-
stitute-oldest  and largest radio home-
study school in the world-will train you
inexpensively in your own home to know
radio from a to z and to increase your
earnings in the radio field

  take another tip-no matter what your
plans are no matter how much or how little
you know about radio-clip the coupon be-
low and look their free book over it is filled
with interesting facts figures and photos
and the information it will give you is worth
a few minutes of anybodys time you will

the classic sciences

 by t oconor sloane phd

centuries ago nobody knows how many the science
of chemistry began in the laboratories of the old alchem-
ists they claimed or hoped that their researches
would  bring about the transmutation of metals and
there is not the least doubt that in many cases by
concealing gold in a crucible they persuaded their patrons that
they were transforming lead or other inferior substance into the
precious metal it is probably because this fraud was attempted
so often that laws were passed against alchemists prohibiting
the exercise of their alleged science before the age of the
alchemists as it may be termed the old philosophers had
formulated the conception of the atom whose name is derived
from the greek and means uncutable or indivisible the so-called
atom in various forms such as the atom of wood or the atom
of iron or copper was taken as being absolutely indestructible
modern chemistry was born when it was found that the atom
of wood and of all compound substances was quite susceptible
of division

  wood can be divided into carbon nitrogen hydrogen and
oxygen sugar can be divided into carbon hydrogen and oxy-
gen many of the old time atoms proved to be quite divisible
so for compound substances the atom was supplanted by the
modern molecule which is a collection of atoms a molecule
of sugar for instance is built up out of atoms of the three
elements named above

  chemists rested very contentedly with this as the basis of their
science the physicists of the time gave no attention to atoms
or molecules considering that they belonged entirely to the
chemists scientists physical and chemical led a quiet and
orderly existence the chemists developing new compounds and
analyzing old ones and adding to the sum of human knowledge
but physicists after a while began to investigate the atom and
for the last few decades the greatest scientific minds of the
world have puzzled over what the atom is they have evolved
the theory that the atom is a highly compound thing that it is
made up of a combination of positive and negative electricities
each in the form of charges of definite amount the atom of
hydrogen was taken as consisting of one positive and one nega-
tive elemental charge of electricity going to the other extreme
the atom of uranium was assigned  charges of positive and
 charges of external or unbound negative electricity the
negative charges or the electrons were taken as having hardly
any weight the atom of uranium weighs about  times as
much as the atom of hydrogen and was taken as having that
number of charges of positive electricity in its atom so we see
what a complicated thing the atom has been theorized as being

  a portion of the negative charges which were the electrons
according to one theory were supposed to whirl around the
central nucleus as it is called which was a mixture of the

positive charges or protons in almost all cases holding bound
within the nucleus a quantity of stationary electrons tnis gave
the bound electrons which were in the nucleus and held fast
there and what were called the planetary electrons which were
whirling ceaselessly aroundthe nucleus the nucleus representing
as it were the center of a little planetary system which had one
essential difference from the solar world a difference not in-
sisted upon as often as it should have been to the effect that
the planetary electrons whirled around in all sorts of planes
the atom having no representative of the plane of the ecliptic
other theories rejected the idea of the revolving electrons

  it is fair to say that man has not the least conception of
what electricity is so when he builds up his atoms out of
electric charges he is reducing the world of matter to the
unknown just as truly as it was unknown in the days of
epicurus the planetary molecule as it was called was the most
interesting conception but as man is never satisfied with the
little he knows and possesses the divinely planted instinct of
curiosity he has gone on investigating and is abandoning the
planetary atom as it was pictured by bohr and has substituted
for it the schrodinger atom this is the latest product the
successor of nearly a dozen well-known predecessors

  if we go into the theory of physics and chemistry we will find
that with these great developments of the last few years the
relatively comfortable old sciences in a sense have disappeared
when we speak of the great authors of greece and rome the
term classics is used the same term is applied to the physics
of the last generation and they are called the classic physics
but while we are straining every nerve to keep up with the
procession as it may be termed of modem science it is a com-
fort to know that when we are analyzing in the chemical labor-
atories or working in mechanics and physics we can still use
the familiar classic sciences of twenty years ago as our tools

  the curious laws and phenomena deduced in modem physics
such as the lorentz-fitzgerald contraction and the change of
mass with motion do not affect us in our lives this is because
they would not be discernible except in extreme cases at
terrestrial velocities and under everyday conditions they and
others also are absolutely imperceptible the word phenome-
non means an appearance so literally speaking the impressive
and really astonishing things in modern physics and mechanics
do not appear as far as we are concerned-they can only become
phenomena or can only appear under conditions entirely
beyond any obtaining in our everyday life we need not worry
over the idea that we are shorter in a sleeping car when it is in
motion than when it is at a station no perceptible or measurable
change can be discerned and analogous things obtain for other
things in higher science where the fourth and fifth dimensions
enter into the equations

authors note

to all profound thinkers in the realms of science
who may chance to read skylark three greetings
i have taken certain liberties with several more or
less commonly accepted theories but i assure you that those
theories have not been violated altogether in ignorance
some of them i myself believe sound others i consider
unsound still others are out of my line so that i am not
well enough informed upon their basic mathematical founda-
tions to have come to any definite conclusion one way or
the other whether or not i consider any theory sound i
did not hesitate to disregard it if its literal application would
have interfered with the logical development of the story
in the skylark of space mrs garby and i decided after
some discussion to allow two mathematical impossibilities
to stand one of these immediately became the target of
critics from maine to california and while no astronomei
has as yet called attention to the
other i would not be surprised to
hear about it even at this late date

sequel to
the skylark of space

thing can be at the same time continuous and discontinuous
we know nothing of the ether-we do not even know
whether or not it exists save as a concept of our own ex-
tremely limited intelligence we are in total ignorance of
the ultimate structure of matter and of the arrangement
and significance of those larger aggregations of matter the
galaxies we do not know nor understand nor can we
define even such fundamental necessities as time and space

chapter i
duquesne goes traveling

in the innermost private
office of steel brookings
and duquesne stared at
each other across the mas-
sive desk duquesnes
voice was cold his black brows
were drawn together

  get this brookings and get
it straight im shoving off at
twelve oclock tonight my ad-
vice to you is to lay off richard
seaton absolutely dont do a
thing nothing hold everything
keep on holding it until i get
back no matter how long that
may be duquesne shot out in
an icy tone

  i am very much surprised at
your change of front doctor
you are the last man i would
have expected to be scared off
after one engagement

  dont be any more of a fool
than you have to brookings
theres a lot of difference be-
tween scared and knowing when
you are simply wasting effort as you remember i
tried to abduct mrs seaton by picking her off with an
attractor from a space-ship i would have bet that
nothing could have stopped me well when they lo-
cated me-probably with an automatic osnomian ray-
detector-and heated me red-hot while i was still better
than two hundred miles up i knew then and there that
they had us stopped that there was nothing we could
do except go back to my plan abandon the abduction
idea and eventually kill them all since my plan would
take time you objected to it and sent an airplane to
drop a five-hundred-pound bomb on them airplane
bomb and all simply vanished it didnt explode you
remember just flashed into light and disappeared with
scarcely any noise then you pulled several more of
your fool ideas such as long-range bombardment and

  while i do not wish it under-
stood that i regard any of the major
features of this story as likely to
become facts in the near future-
indeed it has been my aim to por-
tray the highly improbable-it is my
belief that there is no mathematical
or scientific impossibility to be
found in skylark three

  in fact even though i have re-
peatedly violated theories in which
i myself believe i have in
every case taken great pains to
make certain that the most rigid
mathematical analysis of which i
am capable has failed to show that
i have violated any known and
proven scientific fact by fact i
do not mean the kind of reasoning
based upon assumptions later shown
to be fallacious by which it was
proved that the transatlantic
cable and the airplane were scien-
tifically impossible i refer to defi-
nitely known phenomena which no

possible future development can change-i refer to mathe-
matical proofs whose fundamental equations and operations
involve no assumptions and contain no second-degree un-
certainties

  please bear in mind that we know very little it has
been widely believed that the velocity of light is the limiting
velocity and many of our leading authorities hold this view
-but it cannot be proved and is by no means universally
held in this connection it would appear that j j thomp-
son in beyond the electron shows to his own satisfaction
at least that velocities vastly greater than that of light are
not only possible but necessary to any comprehensive in-
vestigation into the nature of the electron

  we do not know the nature of light neither the undula-
tory theory nor the quantum theory are adequate to explain
all observed phenomena and they seem to be mutually ex-
clusive since it would seem clear by definition that no one

 itor two years readers of
jl amazing stories have
literally clamored for a sequel
to the famous story the sky-
lark of space  which appeared
exactly two years ago except
that skylark three is more
thrilling more exciting and
even more chockful of science
than the other dr smith tells
about the story in his authors
note far better than we can do

amazing stories

so on none of them worked still youve got the nerve
to think that you can get them with ordinary gunmen
ive drawn you diagrams and shown you figures-ive
told you in great detail and in one-syllable words exactly
what were up against now i tell you again that theyve
got something if you had the brains of a pinhead you
would know that anything i cant do with a space-ship
cant be done by a mob of ordinary gangsters im
telling you brookings that you cant do it my way
is absolutely the only way that will work

  but five years doctor

  i may be back in six months but on a trip of this
kind anything can happen so i am planning on being
gone five years even that may not be enough-i am
carrying supplies for ten years and that box of mine
in the vault is not to be opened until ten years from
today

  but surely we shall be able to remove the obstruc-
tions ourselves in a few weeks we always have
oh quit kidding yourself brookings this is no
time for idiocy you stand just as much chance of

killing seaton-

  please doctor please dont talk like that

  still squeamish eh your pussyfooting always did
give me an acute pain im for direct action word and
deed first last and all the time i repeat you have
exactly as much chance of killing richard seaton as a
blind kitten has

  how do you arrive at that conclusion doctor you
seem very fond of belittling our abilities personally
 think that we shall be able to attain our objectives
within a few weeks-certainly long before you can pos-
sibly return from such an extended trip as you have
in mind and since you are so fond of frankness i
will say that i think that seaton has you buffaloed
as you call it nine-tenths of these wonderful osnomian
things i am assured by competent authorities are
scientifically impossible and i think that the other one-
tenth exists only in your own imagination seaton was
lucky in that the airplane bomb was defective and
exploded prematurely and your space-ship got hot
because of your injudicious speed through the atmos-
phere we shall have everything settled by the time
you get back

  if you have ill make you a present of the control-
ling interest in steel and buy myself a chair in some
home for feeble-minded old women your ignorance
and unwillingness to believe any new idea do not change
the facts in any particular even before they went to
osnome seaton was hard to get as you found out
on that trip he learned so much new stuff that it is
now impossible to kill him by any ordinary means you
should realize that fact when he kills every gangster
you send against him at all events be very very
careful not to kill his wife in any of your attacks even
by accident until after you have killed him

  such an event would be regrettable certainly in
that it would remove all possibility of the abduction
it would remove more than that remember the
pcplosion in our laboratory that blew an entire mountain
into impalpable dust draw in your mind a nice vivid
picture of one ten times the size in each of our plants
and in this building i know that you are fool enough
to go ahead with your own ideas in spite of everything
ive said and since i do not yet actually control steel
i cant forbid you to officially but you should know
that i know what im talking about and i say again

that youre going to make an utter fool of yourself
just because you wont believe anything possible that
hasnt been done every day for a hundred years i wish
that i could make you understand that seaton and
crane have got something that we havent-but for the
good of our plants and incidentally for your own
please remember one thing anyway for if you forget
it we wont have a plant left and you personally will
be blown into a fine red mist whatever you start kill
seaton first and be absolutely certain that he is definitely
completely finally and totally dead before you touch
one of dorothy seatons red hairs as long as you
only attack him personally he wont do anything but
kill every man you send against him if you kill her
while hes still alive though-blooie and the saturnine
scientist waved both hands in an expressive pantomime
of wholesale destruction

  probably you are right in that brookings paled
slightly yes seaton would do just that we shall
be very careful until after we succeed in removing him
dont worry--you wont succeed i shall attend to
that detail myself as soon as i get back seaton and
crane and their families the directors and employees
of their plants the banks that by any possibility may
harbor their notes or solutions-in short every person
and everything standing between me and a monopoly of
x-all shall disappear

  that is a terrible program doctor wouldnt the
late perkins plan of an abduction such as i have in
mind be better safer and quicker

  yes-except for the fact that it will not work ive
talked until im blue in the face-ive proved to you
over and over that you cant abduct her now without
first killing him and that you cant even touch him
my plan is the only one that will work seaton isnt
the only one who learned anything-i learned a lot
myself i learned one thing in particular only four
other inhabitants of either earth or osnome ever had
even an inkling of it and they died with their brains
disintegrated beyond reading that thing is my ace in
the hole im going after it when i get it and not
until then will i be ready to take the offensive

  you intend starting open war upon your return
the war started when i tried to pick off the women
with my attractor that is why i am leaving at mid-
night he always goes to bed at eleven-thirty and i
will be out of range of his object-compass before he
wakes up seaton and i understand each other per-
fectly we both know that the next time we meet
one of us is going to be resolved into his component
atoms perhaps into electrons he doesnt know that
hes going to be the one but i do my final word to
you is to lay off-if you dont you and your com-
petent authorities are going to learn a lot

  you do not care to inform me more fully as to
your destination or your plans

  i do not goodbye

chapter ii

dunark visits earth

martin crane reclined in a massive chair
the fingers of his right hand lightly touching
those of his left listening attentively richard
seaton strode up and down the room before his friend
his unruly brown hair on end speaking savagely between
skylark three



teeth clenched upon the stem of his reeking battered
briar brandishing a sheaf of papers

  mart were stuck-stopped dead if my head wasnt
made of solid blue mush id have had a way figured out
of this thing before now but i cant with that zone
of force the skylark would have everything imaginable
-without it were exactly where we were before that
zone is immense man-terrific-its possibilities are un-
thinkable-and fm so cussed dumb that i cant find
out how to use it intelligently-cant use it at all for
that matter by its very nature it is impenetrable to
any form of matter however applied and this calc
here shaking viciously the sheaf of papers containing
his calculations shows that it must also be opaque
to any wave whatever propagated through air or through
ether clear down to cosmic rays behind it we would
be blind and helpless so we cant use it at all it drives
me frantic think of a barrier of pure force impal-
pable immaterial and exerted along a geometrical sur-
face of no thickness whatever-and yet actual enough
to stop even a millikan ray that travels a hundred thou-
sand light-years and then goes through twenty-seven
feet of solid lead just like it was so much vacuum
thats what were up against however im going to
try out that model mart right now come on guy
snap into it lets get busy

  you are getting idiotic again dick crane rejoined
calmly without moving you know even better than
i do that you are playing with the most concentrated
essence of energy that the world has ever seen that

zone of force probably can be generated-

  probably nothing barked seaton its just as
evident a fact as that stool kicking the unoffending
bit of furniture half-way across the room as he spoke
if youdve let me idve shown it to you yesterday
undoubtedly then grant that it is impenetrable to
all matter and to all known waves suppose that it
should prove impenetrable also to gravitation and to
magnetism those phenomena probably depend upon
the ether but we know nothing fundamental of their
nature nor of that of the ether therefore your calcu-
lations comprehensive though they are cannot predict
the effect upon them of your zone of force suppose
that that zone actually does set up a barrier in the ether
so that it nullifies gravitation magnetism and all allied
phenomena so that the power-bars the attractors and
repellers cannot work through it then what as
well as showing me the zone of force you might well
have shown me yourself flying off into space unable to
use your power and helpless if you released the zone
no we must know more of the fundamentals before
you try even a small-scale experiment

  oh bugs youre carrying caution to extremes
mart what can happen even if gravitation should
be nullified i would rise only slowly heading south
the angle of our latitude-thats thirty-nine degrees-
away from the perpendicular i couldnt shoot off on a
tangent as some of these hot-heads have been claiming
inertia would make me keep pace approximately with
the earth in its rotation i would rise slowly-only as
fast as the tangent departs from the curvature of the
earths surface i havent figured out how fast that is
but it must be pretty slow

  pretty slow crane smiled figure it out

  all right-but ill bet its slower than the rise of a
toy balloon seaton threw down the papers and picked
up his slide-rule a twenty-inch trigonometrical duplex

youll concede that it is allowable to neglect the radial
component of the orbital velocity of the earth for a
first approximation wont you-or shall i figure that
in too

  you may ignore that factor

  all right-lets see radius of rotation here in
washington would be cosine latitude times equatorial
radius approximately-call it thirty-two hundred miles
angular velocity fifteen degrees an hour i want secant
fifteen less one times thirty-two hundred right secant
equals one over cosine-um-m-m-m-one point oh three
five then point oh three five times thirty-two hundred
hundred and twelve miles first hour velocity constant
with respect to sun accelerated respecting point of de-
parture ouch you win mart-id kinda step out
well how about this then ill put on a vacuum suit
and carry rations harness outside with the same equip-
ment i used in the test flights before we built skylark i
-plus the new stuff and a coil then throw on the
zone and see what happens there cant be any jar
in taking off and with that outfit i can get back ok
if i go clear to jupiter

  crane sat in silence his keen mind considering every
aspect of the motions possible of velocity of accelera-
tion of inertia he already knew well seatons resource-
fulness in crises and his physical and mental strength

  as far as i can see that might be safe he admitted
finally and we really should know something about it
besides the theory

  fine mart-lets get busy ill be ready in five
minutes yell for the girls will you theyd break
us off at the ankles if we pull anything new without
letting them in on it

  a few minutes later the girls strolled out into
crane field arms around each other-dorothy seaton
her gorgeous auburn hair framing violent eyes and
vivid coloring black-haired dark-eyed margaret crane

  br-r-r its cold dorothy shivered wrapping her
coat more closely about her this must be the coldest
day washington has seen for years

  it is cold margaret agreed i wonder what they
are going to do out here this kind of weather

as she spoke the two men stepped out of the
testing shed-the huge structure that housed their
osnomian-built space-cruiser skylark ii seaton
waddled clumsily wearing as he did a crane vacuum-
suit which built of fur canvas metal and transparent
silica braced by steel netting and equipped with air-
tanks and heaters rendered its wearer independent of
outside conditions of temperature and pressure outside
this suit he wore a heavy harness of leather buckled
about his body shoulders and legs attached to which
were numerous knobs switches dials bakelite cases
and other pieces of apparatus carried by a strong
aluminum framework in turn supported by the harness
the universal bearing of a small power-bar rose directly
above his grotesque-looking helmet

  what do you think youre going to do in that thing
dickie dorothy called then knowing that he could
not hear her voice she turned to crane what are you
letting that precious husband of mine do now martin
he looks as though he were up to something

  while she was speaking seaton had snapped the
release of his face-plate

  nothing much dottie just going to show you-all
the zone of force mart wouldnt let me turn it on


amazing stories

unless i got all cocked and primed for a years journey
into space

  dot what is that zone of force anyway  asked
margaret

  oh its something dick got into his head during that
awful fight they had on osnome he hasnt thought
of anything else since we got back you know how the
attractors and repellers work well he found out some-
thing funny about the way everything acted while the
mardonalians were bombarding them with a certain kind
of a wave-length he finally figured out the exact ray
that did it and found out that if it is made strongly
enough it acts as if a repeller and attractor were working
together-only so much stronger that nothing can get
through the boundary either way-in fact its so strong
that it cuts anything in two thats in the way and the
funny thing is that theres nothing there at all really
but dick says that the forces meeting there or something
make it act as though something really important were
there see 

  uh-huh assented margaret doubtfully just as
crane finished the final adjustments and moved toward
them a safe distance away from seaton he turned
and waved his hand

  instantly seaton disappeared from view and around
the place where he had stood there appeared a shim-
mering globe some twenty feet in diameter-a globe
apparently a perfect spherical mirror which darted
upward and toward the south after a moment the
globe disappeared and seaton was again seen he was
now standing upon a hemispherical mass of earth he
darted back toward the group upon the ground while
the mass of earth fell with a crash a quarter of a mile
away high above their heads the mirror again encom-
passed seaton and again shot upward and southward
five times this maneuver was repeated before seaton
came down landing easily in front of them and opening
his helmet

  its just what we thought it was only worse he
reported tersely cant do a thing with it gravitation
wont work through it-bars wont-nothing will and
dark dark folks you aint never seen no darkness
nor heard no silence it scared me stiff

  poor little boy-afraid of the dark exclaimed
dorothy we saw absolute blackness in space

  not like this you didnt i just saw absolute darkness
and heard absolute silence for the first time in my life
i never imagined anything like it-come on up with
me and ill show it to you

  no you wont his wife shrieked as she retreated
toward crane some other time perhaps

  seaton removed the harness and glanced at the spot
from which he had taken off where now appeared a
hemispherical hole in the ground

  lets see what kind of tracks i left mart and the
two men bent over the depression they saw with
astonishment that the cut surface was perfectly smooth
with not even the slightest roughness or irregularity
visible even the smallest loose grains of sand had been
sheared in two along a mathematically exact hemispheri-
cal surface by the inconceivable force of the disinte-
grating copper bar

  well that sure wins the-

  an alarm bell sounded without a glance around
seaton seized dorothy and leaped into the testing shed
dropping her unceremoniously to the floor he stared

through the telescope sight of an enormous ray-generator
which had automatically aligned itself upon the distant
point of liberation of intra-atomic energy which had
caused the alarm to sound one hand upon the switch
his face was hard and merciless as he waited to make
sure of the identity of the approaching space-ship before
he released the frightful power of his generator upon it

  ive been expecting duquesne to try it again he
gritted striving to make out the visitor yet more than
two hundred miles distant hes out to get you dot-
and this time im not just going to warm him up and
scare him away as i did last time this time that
misguided mutts going to get frizzled right  i cant
locate him with this small telescope mart line him
up in the big one and give me the word will you
i see him dick but it is not duquesnes ship it is
built of transparent arenak like the kondal even
though it seems impossible i believe it is the kondal
maybe so and again maybe duquesne built it-or
stole it oh second thought though i dont believe that
duquesne would be fool enough to tackle us again
in the same way-but im taking no chances    ok
it is the kondal i can see dunark and sitar myself
now

  the transparent vessel soon neared the field and the
four terrestrials walked out to greet their osnomian
friends through the arenak walls they recognized
dunark kofedix of kondal at the controls and saw
sitar his beautiful young queen lying in one of the
seats near the wall she attempted a friendly greeting
but her face was strained as though she were laboring
under a burden too great for her to bear

  as they watched dunark slipped a helmet over his
head and one over sitars pressed a button to open
one of the doors and supported her toward the opening

  they musnt come out dick exclaimed dorothy
in dismay theyll freeze to death in five minutes with-
out any clothes on

  yes and sitar cant stand up under our gravitation
either-i doubt if dunark can for long and seaton
dashed toward the vessel motioning the visitor back

  but misunderstanding the signal dunark came on
as he clambered heavily through the door he staggered
as though under an enormous weight and sitar col-
lapsed upon the frozen ground trying to help her
half-kneeling over her dunark struggled his green skin
paling to a yellowish tinge at the touch of the bitter
and unexpected cold seaton leaped forward and
gathered sitar up in his mighty arms as though she
were a child

  help dunark back in mart he directed crisply
hop in girls-weve got to take these folks back up
where they can live

  seaton shut the door and as everyone lay flat in
the seats crane who had taken the controls applied
one notch of power and the huge vessel leaped upward
miles of altitude were gained before crane brought
the cruiser to a stop and locked her in place with an
anchoring attractor

  there he remarked calmly gravitation here is
approximately the same as it is upon osnome

  yes put in seaton standing up and shedding cloth-
ing in all directions and i rise to remark that wed
better undress as far as the law allows-perhaps farther
i never did like osnomian ideas of comfortable warmth
but we can endure it by peeling down to bedrock--
skylark three



sitar jumped up happily completely restored and
the three women threw their arms around each other
what a horrible terrible frightful world ex-
claimed sitar her eyes widening as she thought of her
first experience with our earth much as i love you
i shall never dare try to visit you again i have never
been able to understand why you terrestrials wear what
you call clothes nor why you are so terribly brutally
strong now i really know-i will feel the utterly cold
and savage embrace of that awful earth of yours as
long as i live

  oh its not so bad sitar seaton who was shaking
both of dunarks hands vigorously assured her over
his shoulder all depends on where you were raised
we like it that way and osnome gives us the pip but
you poor fish turning again to dunark with all my
brains inside your skull you should have known what
you were letting yourself in for

  thats true after a fashion dunark admitted but
your brain told me that washington was hot if id
have thought to recalculate your actual fahrenheit de-
grees into our loro    but that figures only forty-
seven and while very cold we could have endured it
-wait a minute im getting it you have what you
callseasons this then must be yourwinter right
right the first time thats the way your brain
works behind my pan too i could figure anything out
all right after it happened but hardly ever beforehand
-so i guess i cant blame you much at that but
what i want to know is howd you get here  it would
take more than my brains-you cant see our sun from
anywhere near osnome even if you knew exactly where
to look for it

  easy remember those wrecked instruments you
threw out of skylark i when we built skylark iif
having every minute detail of the configuration of
seatons brain engraved upon his own dunark spoke
english in seatons own characteristic careless fashion
only when thinking deeply or discussing abstruse matter
did seaton employ the carefully selected and precise
phrasing which he knew so well how to use well
none of them was beyond repair and the juice was still
on most of them one was an object-compass bearing
on the earth we simply fixed the bearings put on
some minor improvements and here we are

  let us all sit down and be comfortable he con-
tinued changing into the kondalian tongue without a
break and i will explain why we have come we are
in most desperate need of two things which you alone
can supply-salt and that strange metal x salt i
know you have in great abundance but i know that
you have very little of the metal you have only the
one compass upon that planet

  thats all-one is all we set on it however weve
got close to half a ton of the metal on hand-you can
have all you want

even if i took it all which i would not like to do
that would be less than half enough we must have
at least one of your tons and two tons would be better
two tons holy cat are you going to plate a fleet
of battle cruisers

  more than that we must plate an area of copper
of some ten thousand square miles-in fact the very
life of our entire race depends upon it

  its this way he continued as the four earth-beings
stared at him in wonder shortly after you left osnome

we were invaded by the inhabitants of the third planet
of our fourteenth sun luckily for us they landed upon
mardonale and in less than two days there was not a
single osnomian left alive upon that half of the planet
they wiped out our grand fleet in one brief engagement
and it was only the kondal and a few more like her
that enabled us to keep them from crossing the ocean
even with our full force of these vessels we cannot
defeat them our regular kondalian weapons were use-
less we shot explosive copper charges against them
of such size as to cause earthquakes all over osnome
without seriously crippling their defenses their offen-
sive weapons are almost irresistible-they have genera-
tors that burn arenak as though it were so much paper
and a series of deadly frequencies against which only
a copper-driven ray screen is effective and even that
does not stand up long

  how come you lasted till now then  asked seaton

  they have nothing like the skylark and no knowl-
edge of intra-atomic energy therefore their space-
ships are of the rocket type and for that reason they
can cross only at the exact time of conjunction or
whatever you call it-no not conjunction exactly either
since the two planets do not revolve around the same
sun but when they are closest together our solar
system is so complex you know that unless the trips
are timed exactly to the hour the vessels will not be
able to land upon osnome but will be drawn aside and
be lost if not actually drawn into the vast central sun
although it may not have occurred to you a little reflec-
tion will show that the inhabitants of all the central
planets such as osnome must perforce be absolutely
ignorant of astronomy and of all the wonders of outer
space before your coming we knew nothing beyond
our own solar system and very little of that we knew
of the existence of only such of the closest planets as
were brilliant enough to be seen in our continuous sun-
light and they were few immediately after your coming
i gave your knowledge of astronomy to a group of
our foremost physicists and mathematicians and they
have been working ceaselessly from space-ships-close
enough so that observations could be recalculated to
osnome and yet far enough away to afford perfect
seeing as you call it

  but i dont know any more about astronomy than
a pig does about sunday protested seaton

  your knowledge of details is of course incomplete
conceded dunark but the detailed knowledge of the
best of your earthly astronomers would not help us a
great deal since we are so far removed from you in
space you however have a very clear and solid knowl-
edge of the fundamentals of the science and that is
what we need above all things

  well maybe youre right at that i do know the
general theory of the motions and i studied some celes-
tial mechanics im awfully weak on advanced theory
though as youll find out when you get that far

  perhaps-but since our enemies have no knowledge
of astronomy whatever it is not surprising that their
rocket-ships can be launched only at one particularly
favorable time for there are many planets and satellites
of which they can know nothing to throw their vessels
off the course

  some material essential to the operation of their
war machinery apparently must come from their own
planet for they have ceased attacking have dug in


amazing stories

and are simply holding their ground it may be that
they had not anticipated as much resistance as we could
offer with space-ships and intra atomic energy at any
rate they have apparently saved enough of that material
to enable them to hold out until the next conjunction
-i cannot think of a better word for it-shall occur
our forces are attacking constantly with all the arma-
ment at our command but it is certain that if the next
conjunction is allowed to occur it means the end of the
entire kondalian nation

  what dyou mean if the next conjunction is allowed
to occur interjected seaton nobody can stop it
i am stopping it dunark stated quietly grim pur-
pose in every lineament that-conjunction shall never
occur that is why i must have the vast quantities of
salt and x we are building abutments of arenak
upon the first satellite of our seventh planet and upon
our sixth planet itself we shall cover them with plated
active copper and install chronometers to throw the
switches at precisely the right moment we have cal-
culated the exact times places and magnitudes of the
forces to be used we shall throw the sixth planet
some distance out of its orbit and force the first satellite
of the seventh planet clear out of that planets influence
the two bodies whose motions we have thus changed
will collide in such a way that the resultant body will
meet the planet of our enemies in head-on collision long
before the next conjunction the two bodies will be
of almost equal masses and will have opposite and
approximately equal velocities hence the resultant fused
or gaseous mass will be practically without velocity
and will fall directly into the fourteenth sun
wouldnt it be easier to destroy it with an explosive
copper bomb

  easier yes but much more dangerous to the rest
of our solar system we cannot calculate exactly the
effect of the collisions we are planning-but it is almost
certain that an explosion of sufficient violence to destroy
all life upon the planet would disturb its motion suffi-
ciently to endanger the entire system the way we have
in mind will simply allow the planet and one satellite
to drop out quietly-the other planets of the same sun
will soon adjust themselves to the new conditions and
the system at large will be practically unaffected-at
least so we believe

  seatons eyes narrowed as his thoughts turned to the
quantities of copper and x required and to the engi-
neering features of the project cranes first thought
was of the mathematics involved in a computation of
that magnitude and character dorothys quick reaction
was one of pure horror

  he cant dick he mustnt it would be too ghastly
its outrageous-its unthinkable-its-its-its simply
too horrible her violet eyes flamed and margaret
joined in f

-	that would be awful martin think of the destruc-
tion of a whole planet-of an entire world-with all its
inhabitants it makes me shudder even to think of it

dunark leaped to his feet ablaze but before he
could say a word seaton silenced him

  shut up dunark pipe down dont say anything
youll be sorry for-let me tell em close your mouth
i tell you as dunark still tried to get a word in i
tell you ill tell em and when i tell em they stay told
now listen you two girls-youre going off half-cocked
and youre both full of little red ants what do you

think dunark is up against sherman chirped it when
he described war-and this is a real he-war a brand
totally unknown on our earth it isnt a question of
whether or not to destroy a population-the only ques-
tion is which population is to be destroyed one of
thems got to go remember those folks go into a war
thoroughly and there isnt a thought even remotely
resembling our conception of mercy in any of their
minds on either side if dunarks plans go through the
enemy nation will be wiped out that is horrible of
course but on the ojther hand if we block him off from
salt and x the entire kondalian nation will be de-
stroyed just as thoroughly and efficiently and even more
horribly-not one man woman or child would be spared
which nation do you want saved play that over a
couple of times on your adding machine dot and let
me know what you get

  dorothy taken aback opened and closed her moutk
twice before she found her voice

  but dick they couldnt possibly would they kill
them all dick surely they wouldnt-they couldnt
surely they would-and could they do-its good
technique in those parts of the galaxy dunark has
just told us of how they killed every member of the
entire race of mardonalians in forty hours kondal
would go the same way dont kid yourself dimples-
dont be a child war up there is no species of pink tea
believe me-half of my brain has been through thirty
years of osnomian warfare and i know precisely what
im talking about lets take a vote personally im
in favor of osnome mart

  osnome

 dottie peggy both remained silent for some
time then dorothy turned to margaret

  you tell him peggy-we both feel the same way
dick you know that we wouldnt want the konda-
lians destroyed-but the other is so-such a-well such
an utter shrecklichkeit-isnt there some other way out
im afraid not-but if there is any other possible
way out ill do my da- to help find it he promised
the ayes have it dunark well skip over to that x
planet and load you up

  dunark grasped seatons hand thanks dick he
said simply but before you help me farther and
lest i might be in some degree sailing under false colors
i must tell you that wearer of the seven disks though you
are overlord of osnome though you are my brain
brother though you are had you decided against me
nothing but my death could have kept me away from
that salt and your x compass

  why sure assented seaton in surprise why not 
fair enough anybody would do the same-dont let
that bother you

how is your supply of platinum asked dunark
mighty low we had about decided to hop over there
after some i want some of your textbooks on electricity
and so on too i see you brought a load of platinum with
you

  yes a few hundred tons we also brought along an
assortment of books i knew you would be interested in
a box of radium a few small bags of gems of various
kinds and some of our fabrics sitar thought your
karfediro would like to have while we are here i
would like to get some books on chemistry and some
other things

  well get you the congressional library if you want
skylark three



trying to help her half kneeling over her
dunark struggled his green skin paling to a
yellowish tinge at the touch of the bitter and
unexpected cold


amazing

stories

it and anything else you think youd like well gang
lets go places and do things what to do mart
we had better drop back to earth have the laborers
unload the platinum and load on the salt books and
other things then both ships will go to the x planet
as we will each want compasses on it for future use
while we are loading i should like to begin remodeling
our instruments to make them something like these
with dunarks permission these instruments are won-
ders dick-vastly ahead of anything i have ever seen
come and look at them if you want to see something
really beautiful

  coming up but say mart while i think of it we
mustnt forget to install a zone-of-force apparatus on
this boat too even though we cant use it intelligently
it certainly would be a winner as a defense we couldnt
hurt anybody through it of course but if we should
happen to be getting licked anywhere all wed have to
do would be to wrap ourselves up in it they couldnt
touch us nothing in the ether spectrum is corkscrewy
enough to get through it

  thats the second idea youve had since ive known
you dicky dorothy smiled at crane do you think
he should be allowed to run at large martin

  that is a real idea we may need it-you never
can tell even if we never find any other use for the
zone of force that one is amply sufficient to justify its
installation

  yes it would be for you-and im getting to be
a regular safety-first simon myself since they opened
up on us what about those instruments

the three men gathered around the instrument-
board and dunark explained the changes he had
made-and to such men as seaton and crane it was
soon evident that they were examining an installation
embodying sheer perfection of instrumental control-a
system which only those wonder instrument-makers the
osnomians could have devised the new object-com-
passes were housed in arenak cases after setting and
the housings were then exhausted to the highest attain-
able vacuum oscillation was set up by means of one
carefully standardized electrical impulse instead of by
the clumsy finger-touch seaton had used the bearings
built of arenak and osnomian jewels were as strong
as the axles of a truck and yet were almost perfectly
frictionless

  i like them myself admitted dunark without a
load the needles will rotate freely more than a thousand
hours on the primary impulse as against a few minutes
in the old type and under load they are many thousands
of times as sensitive

  youre a blinding flash and a deafening report ace
declared seaton enthusiastically that compass is as
far ahead of my model as the skylark is ahead of
wrights first glider

  the other instruments were no less noteworthy dun-
ark had adopted the perkins telephone system but had
improved it until it was scarcely recognized and had
made it capable of almost unlimited range even the
guns-heavy rapid-firers mounted in spherical bearings
in the walls-were aimed and fired by remote control
from the board he had devised full automatic steer-
ing controls and meters and recorders for acceleration
velocity distance and flight-angle he had perfected a
system of periscopic vision which enabled the pilot to

see the entire outside surfaces of the shell and to look
toward any point of the heavens without interference

  this kind of takes my eye too prince seaton said
as he seated himself swung a large concave disk in
front of him and experimented with levers and dials
you certainly cant call this thing a periscope-its no
more a periscope than i am a polyp when you look
through this plate its better than looking out of a
window-it subtends more than the angle of vision so
that you cant see anything but out-of-doors-i thought
for a second i was going to fall out what do you
call em dunark

  kraloto that would be in english  seeing-plate 
or rather call it visiplate

  thats a good word mart take a look if you want
to see a set of perfect lenses and prisms

  crane looked into the visiplate and gasped the vessel
had disappeared-he was looking directly down upon
the earth below him

  no trace of chromatic spherical or astigmatic aber-
ration he reported in surprise the refracting system
is invisible-it seems as though nothing intervenes be-
tween the eye and the object you perfected all these
things since we left osnome dunark you are in a
class by yourself i could not even copy them in less
than a month and i never could have invented them
i did not do it alone by any means the society
of instrument-makers of which i am only one member
installed and tested more than a hundred systems this
one represents the best features of all the systems tried
it will not be necessary for you to copy them i brought
along twocomplete duplicate sets for the skylark as
well as a dozen or so of the compasses i thought that
perhaps these particular improvements might not have
occurred to you since you terrestrials are not as fa-
miliar as we are with complex instrumental work
crane and seaton spoke together

  that was thoughtful of you dunark and we appre-
ciated it fully

  that puts four more palms on your croix de guerre
ace thanks a lot

  say dick called dorothy from her seat near the
wall if were going down to the ground how about
sitar

  by lying down and not doing anything and by stay-
ing in the vessel where it is warm she will be all right
for the short time we must stay here dunark answered
for his wife i will help all i can but i do not know
how much that will be

  it isnt so bad lying down sitar agreed i dont
like your earth a bit but i can stand it a little while
anyway i must stand it so why worry about it

   at-a-girl cheered seaton and as for you du-
nark youll pass the time just like sitar does-lying
down if you do much chasing around down there
where we live youre apt to get your lights and liver
twisted all out of shape-so youll stay put horizontal
weve got men enough around the shop to eat this cargo
in three hours let alone unload it while they unload
and load you up well install the zone apparatus put
a compass on you put one of yours on us and then
you can hop back up here where youre comfortable
then as soon as we can get the lark ready for the
trip well jump up here and be on our way every-
thing clear  cut the rope mart-let the old bucket
drop
skylark three



chapter iii
skylark two sets out

say mart i just got conscious it never occurred
to me until just now as dunark left that im
as good an instrument-maker as dunark is-the
same one in fact-and ive got a hunch you know
that needle on duquesne hasnt been working for quite
a while well i dont believe its out of commission
at all i think hes gone somewhere so far away that
it cant read on him im going to house it in re-jewel
it and find out where he is

an excellent idea he has even you worrying and

as for myself-

  worrying that bird is simply pulling my cork
im so scared hell get dottie that im running around
in circles and biting myself in the small of the back
hes got a hen on you can bet your shirt on that-
what gravels me is hes aiming at the girls not at us
or the job

  i should say that someone had aimed at you fairly
accurately judging by the number of bullets stopped
lately by that arenak armor of yours i wish that i could
take some of the strain but they are centering all their
attacks upon you

  yes-i cant stick my nose outside our yard without
somebody throwing lead at it its funny too youre
more important to the power-plant than i am

  you should know why they are not afraid of me
while my spirit is willing enough it was your skill and
rapidity with a pistol that frustrated four attempts at
abduction in as many days it is positively uncanny
the way you explode into action with all my practice
i didnt even have my pistol out yesterday until it was
all over and besides prescotts guards we had four
policemen with us-detailed to guard us-because of
the number of gunmen you had to kill before that
it aint practice so much mart-its a gift ive
always been fast and i react automatically you think
first thats why youre slow those cops were funny
they didnt know what it was all about until it was
all over-all but calling the wagon that was the worst
yet one of their slugs struck directly in front of my
left eye-it was kinda funny at that seeing it splash
-and i thought i was inside a boiler in a riveting
shop when those machine-guns cut loose it was hectic
all right while it lasted but one thing ill tell the atten-
tive world-were not doing all the worrying very
few if any of the gangsters they send after us are
getting back wonder what they think when they shoot
at us and we dont drop

  but im afraid im beginning to crack mart seaton
went on his voice becoming grimly earnest i dont
like anything about this whole mess i dont like all
four of us wearing armor all the time i dont like living
constantly under guard i dont like all this killing and
this constant menace of losing dorothy if i let her out
of my sight for five seconds is driving me mad to tell
you the real truth im devilishly afraid that theyll
figure out something thatll work i could grab off two
women or kill two men if they had armor and guns
enough to stock a war i believe that duquesne could
too-and the rest of that bunch arent imbeciles either
by any means i wont feel safe until all four-of us
are in the skylark and a long ways from here im
sure glad were pulling out and i dont intend to come

back until i get a good line on duquesne hes the
bird im going to get and get right-and when i get
him ill tell the cock-eyed world hell stay got there
wont be any two atoms of his entire carcass left in the
same township i meant that promise when i gave it
to him

  he realizes that fully he knows that it is now
definitely either his life or our own and he is really
dangerous when he took steel over and opened war
upon us he did it with his eyes wide open with his
ideas he must have a monopoly of x or nothing and
he knows the only possible way of getting it however
you and i both know that he would not let either one
of us live even though we surrendered

  you chirped it but that guys going to find hes
started something unless i get paralysis of the intentions
well how about turning up a few r p m  we dont
want to keep dunark waiting too long

  there is very little to do beyond installing the new
instruments and that is nearly done we can finish
pumping out the compass en route you have already
installed every weapon of offense and defense known
to either earthly or osnomian warfare including those
ray-generators and screens you moaned so about not
having during the battle over kondal i believe that
we have on board every article for which either of us
has been able to imagine even the slightest use

  yes weve got her so full of plunder that theres
hardly room left for quarters you aint figuring on
taking anybody but shiro along are you

  no i suppose there is no real necessity for taking
even him but he wants very much to go and may prove
himself useful

  ill say hell be useful none of us really enjoys
polishing brass or washing dishes-and besides hes one
star cook and an a-l housekeeper

the installation of the new instruments was soon
completed and while dorothy and margaret made
last-minute preparations for departure the men called
a meeting of the managing directors and department
heads of the seaton-crane co engineers the chiefs
gave brief reports in turn units number one and
number two of the immense new central super-power
plant were in continuous operation number three was
almost ready to cut in number four was being rushed
to completion number five was well under way the
research laboratory was keeping well up on its problems
troubles were less than had been anticipated finan-
cially it was a gold mine with no expense for boilers
or fuel and thus with a relatively small investment in
plant and a very small operating cost they were selling
power at one-sixth of prevailing rates and still profits
were almost paying for all new construction with the
completion of number five rates would be reduced
still further

  in short dad everythings slick remarked seaton
to mr vaneman after the others had gone

  yes your plan of getting the best men possible pay-
ing them well and giving them complete authority and
sole responsibility has worked to perfection i have
never seen an undertaking of such size go forward so
smoothly and with such fine co-operation

  thats the way we wanted it we hand-picked the
directors and put it up to you strictly you did the
same to the managers everybody knows that his end is
up to him and him alone-so he digs in


amazing stories

  however dick while everything at the works is so
fine when is this other thing going to break

  weve won all the way so far but im afraid some-
things about due thats the big reason i want to get
dot away for a while you know what theyre up to
too well the older man answered dottie or mrs
crane or both her mother-she is telling her goodbye
now-and i agree that the danger here is greater than
out there

  danger out there with the old can fixed the way
she is now dots a lot safer there than you are in bed
your house might fall down you know

  youre probably right son-i know you and i
know martin crane together and in the skylark i
believe you invincible

  all set dick asked dorothy appearing in the
doorway

  all set youve got the dope for prescott and every-
body dad we may be back in six months or we may
see something to investigate and be gone a year or so
dont begin to lose any sleep until after weve been
out-oh say three years well make it a point to be
back by then

  farewells were said the party embarked and sky-
lark two shot upward seaton flipped a phone set over
his head and spoke

  dunark    coming out heading directly for x
   no better stay quite a ways off to one side when
we get going good  yes im accelerating twenty
six point oh oh oh    yes ill call you now and then
until the radio waves get lost to check the course with
you after that keep on the last course reverse at the
calculated distance and by the time were pretty well
slowed down well feel around for each other with
the compasses and go in together right uh-huh
   fine so long

  in order that the two vessels should keep reasonably
close together it had been agreed that each should be
held at an acceleration of exactly twenty-six feet per
second positive and negative this figure represented
a compromise between the gravitational forces of the
two worlds upon which the different parties lived
while considerably less than the acceleration of gravi-
tation at the surface of the earth the terrestrials
could readily accustom themselves to it and it was not
enough greater than that of osnome to hamper
seriously the activities of the green people

  well clear of the earths influence seaton assured
himself that everything was functioning properly then
stretched to his full height wreathed his arms over his
head and heaved a deep sigh of relief

  folks he declared this is the first time ive
felt right since we got out of this old bottle why i
feel so good a cat could walk up to me and scratch
me right in the eye and i wouldnt even scratch back
yowp im a wild siberian catamount and this is my
night to howl whee-ee-yerow

  dorothy laughed a gay lilting carol

  havent i always told you he had cat blood in him
peggy just like all tomcats every once in a while
he has to stretch his claws and yowl but go ahead
dickie i like it-this is the first uproar youve made
in weeks i believe ill join you

  it most certainly is a relief to get this load off our
minds i could do a little ladylike yowling myself
margaret said and crane lying completely at ease a

thin spiral of smoke curling upward from his cigarette
nodded agreement

  dicks yowling is quite expressive at times all
of us feel the same way but some of us are unable
to express ourselves quite so vividly however it is
past bedtime and we should organize our crew shall
we do it as we did before 

  no it isnt necessary everything is automatic the
bar is held parallel to the guiding compass and signal
bells ring whenever any of the instruments show a trace
of abnormal behavior dont forget that there is at least
one meter registering and recording every factor of our
flight with this control system we cant get into any
such jam as we did last trip

  surely you are not suggesting that we run all night
with no one at the controls

  exactly that a man camping at this board is paint-
ing the lily and gilding fine gold awake or asleep
nobody need be closer to it than is necessary to hear
a bell if one should ring and you can hear them all
over the ship furthermore ill bet a hat we wont
hear a signal a week simply as added precaution
though ive run lines so that any time one of these signals
lets go it sounds a buzzer on the head of our bed so
im automatically taking the night shift remember
mart these instruments are thousands of times as sensi-
tive as the keenest human senses-theyll spot trouble
long before we could even if we were looking right
at it

  of course you understand these instruments much
better than i do as yet if you trust them i am per-
fectly willing to do the same goodnight

c eaton sat down and dorothy nestled beside him
her head snuggled into the curve of his shoulder

  sleepy cuddle-pup

  heavens no i couldnt sleep now lover-could
you 

  not any whats the use

  his arm tightened around her apparently motion-
less to its passengers the cruiser bored serenely on into
space with ever-mounting velocity there was not the
faintest sound not the slightest vibration-only the pe-
culiar violet glow surrounding the shining copper cylin-
der in its massive universal bearing gave any indication
of the thousands of kilowatts being generated in that
mighty intra-atomic power-plant seaton studied it
thoughtfully

  you know if that violet aura and copper bar were a
little different in shade and tone of color theyd be just
like your eyes and hair he remarked finally

  you burn me up dick she retorted her entrancing
low chuckle bubbling through her words you do say
the weirdest things at times possibly they would-and
if the moon were made of different stuff than it is and
had a different color it might be green cheese too
what say we go over and look at the stars

 af yu were rufus he commanded sternly
dont move a millimeter-youre a drive fit right where
you are ill get you any stars you want and bring them
right in here to you what constellation would you like 
ill get you the southern cross-we never see it in
washington

  no i want something familiar the pleiades or the
big dipper-no get me canis major-where sirius
brightest jewel in the diadem of the firmament holds
skylark three



sway- she quoted there thought id forgotten all
the astronomy you ever taught me didnt you think
you can find it 

  sure declination about minus twenty as i remem-
ber it and right ascension between six and seven hours
lets see-where would that be from our course

  he thought for a moment manipulated several levers
and dials snapped off the lights and swung number one
exterior visiplate around directly before their eyes

oh    oh    this is magnificent dick she ex-
claimed its stupendous it seems as though we were
right out there in space itself and not in here at all
its    its just too perfectly darn wonderful
although neither of them was unacquainted with inter-
stellar space it presents a spectacle that never fails to
awe even the most seasoned observer and no human
being had ever before viewed the wonders of space from
such a coign of vantage thus the two fell silent and
awed as they gazed out into the abysmal depths of the
interstellar void the darkness of earthly night is
ameliorated by light-rays scattered by the atmosphere
the stars twinkle and scintillate and their light is diffused
because of the same medium but here what a con-
trast  they saw the utter absolute darkness of the com-
plete absence of all light and upon that indescribable
blackness they beheld superimposed the almost unbear-
able brilliance of enormous suns concentrated into mathe-
matical points dimensionless sirius blazed in blue-white
splendor dominating the lesser members of his constella-
tion a minute but intensely brilliant diamond upon a field
of black velvet-his refulgence unmarred by any trace of
scintillation or distortion

  as seaton slowly shifted the field of vision angling
toward and across the celestial equator and the ecliptic
they beheld in turn mighty rigel the belt headed by
dazzlingly brilliant-white delta-orionis red betelguese
storied aldebaran the friend of mariners and the astro-
nomically constant pleiades

  seatons arm contracted swinging dorothy into his
embrace their lips met and held

  isnt it wonderful lover she murmured to be out
here in space this way together away from all our
troubles and worries  i am so happy

  its all of that sweetheart mine

  i almost died every time they shot at you suppose
your armor cracked or something i wouldnt want to
go on living-id just naturally die

  im glad it didnt-and im twice as glad that they
didnt succeed in grabbing you away from me   
his jaw set rigidly his gray eyes became hard as tem-
pered drills blackie duquesne has something coming
to him so far i have always paid my debts i shall
settle with him  in full

  that was an awfully quick change of subject he
continued his voice changirg instantly into a lighter
vein but thats one penalty of being human we cant
live in high altitudes all our lives-if we could there
would be no thrill in ascending them so often

  yes we love each other just the same-more than
anybody else i ever heard of after a moment she eyed
him shrewdly and continued

  youve got something on your mind besides that
tangled mop of hair big boy tell it to red-top
nothing much 

  come on fess up-its good for the soul you cant
fool your own wife guy i know your little winning
ways too well

  let me finish woman i was about to bare my very
soul to resume-nothing much to go on but a hunch
but i think duquesnes somewhere out here in the great
open spaces where men are sometimes schemers as well
as men and if so im after him-foot horse and
marines

  that object compass

  yes you see i built that thing myself and i know
darn well it isnt out of order its still on him but
doesnt indicate ergo he is too far away to reach-and
with his weight i could find him anywhere up to about
one and a half light-years if he wants to go that far
away from home where is his logical destination it
cant be anywhere but osnome since that is the only
place we stopped at for any length of time-the only
place where he could have learned anything hes learned
something or found something useful to him there just
as we did that is certain since he is not the type of man
to do anything without a purpose uncle dudley is on
his trail-and will be able to locate him pretty soon
when will you get that new compass-case exhausted
to a skillionth of a whillimeter or something whatever it
is  i thought dunark said it took five hundred hours of
pumping to get it where he wanted it 

  it did him-but while the osnomians are wonders at
some things theyre not so hot at others you see ive
got three pumps on that job in series first a rode-
bush-michalek super-pump then backing that an ordi-
nary mercury-vapor pump and last backing both the
others a cenco-hyvac motor-driven oil pump in less
than fifty hours that case will be as empty as a flappers
skull just to make sure of cleaning up the last infini-
tesimal traces though im going to flash a getter charge
of tantalum in it after that the atmosphere in that
case will be tenuous-take my word for it

  ill have to most of that contribution to science be-
ing over my head like a circus tent what say we let
skylark two drift by herself for a while and catch us
some of natures sweet restorer

chapter iv
the zone of force is tested

seaton strode into the control room with a small
oblong box in his hand crane was seated at the
desk poring over an abstruse mathematical trea-
tise in science margaret was working upon a bit of em-
broidery dorothy seated upon a cushion on the floor
with one foot tucked under her was reading her hand
straying from time to time to a box of chocolates con-
veniently near

  well this is a peaceful home-like scene-too bad to
bust it up just finished sealing off and flashing out this
case mart going to see if shell read want to take a
look

  he placed the compass upon the plane table so that its
final bearing could be read upon the master circles con-
trolled by the gyroscopes then simultaneously started
his stop-watch and pressed the button which caused a
minute couple to be applied to the needle instantly the
needle began to revolve and for many minutes there was
no apparent change in its motion in either the primary or
secondary bearings

  do you suppose it is out of order after all  asked
crane regretfully

j am chem soc   s


amazing

stories

  i dont think so seaton pondered you see they
werent designed to indicate such distances on such small
objects as men so i threw a million ohms in series with
the impulse that cuts down the free rotation to less
than half an hour and increases the sensitivity to the
limit there isnt she trying to quit it 

  yes it is settling down it must be on him still
finally the ultra-sensitive needle came to rest when
it had done so seaton calculated the distance read the
direction and made a reading upon osnome

  hes there all right bearings agree and distances
check to within a light-year which is as close as we can
hope to check on as small a mass as a man well thats
that-nothing to do about it until after we get there
one sure thing mart-were not coming straight back
home from x

   no an investigation is indicated

  well that puts me out of a job what to do dont
want to study like you cant crochet like peg darned
if ill sit cross-legged on a pillow and eat candy like
that titian blonde over there on the floor i know what
-ill build me a mechanical educator and teach shiro to
talk english instead of that mess of language he in-
dulges in howd that be mart 

  dont do it put in dorothy positively hes just
too perfect the way he is especially dont do it if hed
talk the way you do-or could you teach him to talk the
way you write

  ouch thats a dirty dig however mrs seaton
i am able and willing to defend my customary mode of
speech you realize that the spoken word is ephemeral
whereas the thought whose nuances have once been ex-
pressed in imperishable print is not subject to revision-
its crudities can never be remodeled into more subtle
more gracious shading it is my contention that due to
these inescapable conditions the mental effort necessi-
tated by the employment of nice distinctions in sense and
meaning of words and a slavish adherence to the dictates
of the more precise grammarians should be reserved for
the print 

  he broke off as dorothy in one lithe motion rose and
hurled her pillow at his head

  choke him somebody perhaps you had better build
it dick after all

  i believe that he would like it dick he is trying
hard to learn and the continuous use of a dictionary is
undoubtedly a nuisance to him

  ill ask him shiro

  you have call sir shiro entered the room from his
galley with his unfailing bow

  yes howd you like to learn to talk english like
crane there does-without taking lessons 

  shiro smiled doubtfully unable to take such a thought
seriously

  yes it can be done crane assured him doctor
seaton can build a machine which will teach you all at
once if you like

  i like sir enormously yes sir i years study and
pore but honorable english extraordinary difference
from nipponese-no can do dictionary useful
but  he flipped pages dexterously extremely
cumbrous if honorable seaton can do shall be ex-
treme   gratification

  he bowed again smiled and went out

   ill do just that little thing so long folks im going
up to the shop

day after day the skylark plunged through the vast
emptiness of the interstellar reaches at the end
of each second she was traveling exactly twenty-six feet
per second faster than she had been at its beginning and
as day after day passed her velocity mounted into figures
which became meaningless even when expressed in
thousands of miles per second still she seemed sta-
tionary to her occupants and only different from a vessel
motionless upon the surface of the earth in that objects
within her hull had lost three-sixteenths of their normal
weight acceleration too had its effect only the
rapidity with which the closer suns and their planets were
passed gave any indication of the frightful speed at
which they were being hurtled along by the inconceivable
power of that disintegrating copper bar

  when the vessel was nearly half-way to x the bar
was reversed in order to change the sign of their accelera-
tion and the hollow sphere spun through an angle of one
hundred and eighty degrees around the motionless cage
which housed the enormous gyroscopes still apparently
motionless and exactly as she had been before the sky-
lark was now actually traveling in a direction which
seemed down and with a velocity which was being con-
stantly decreased by the amount of their negative ac-
celeration

  a few days after the bar had been reversed seaton
announced that the mechanical educator was complete
and brought it into the control room

  in appearance it was not unlike a large radio set but
it was infinitely more complex it possessed numerous
tubes kino-lamps and photo-electric cells as well as
many coils of peculiar design-there were dozens of
dials and knobs and a multiple set of head-harnesses

  how can a thing like that possibly work as it does 
asked crane i know that it does work but i could
scarcely believe it even after it had educated me

  that is nothing like the one dunark used dick ob-
jected dorothy how ccme 

  ill answer you first dot this is an improved
model-it has quite a few gadgets of my own in it now
mart as to how it works-it isnt so funny after you
understand it-its a lot like radio in that respect it
operates on a band of frequencies lying between the
longest light and heat waves and the shortest radio
waves this thing here is the generator of those waves
and a very heavy power amplifier the headsets are
stereoscopic transmitters taking or receiving a three-
dimensional view nearly all matter is transparent to
those waves for instance bones hair and so on how-
ever cerebin a cerebroside peculiar to the thinking struc-
ture of the brain is opaque to them dunark not know-
ing chemistry didnt know why the educator worked or
what it worked on-he found out by experiment that it
did work just as we found out about electricity this
three-dimensional model or view or whatever you want
to call it is converted into electricity in the headsets and
the resulting modulated wave goes back to the educator
there it is heterodyned with another wave-this second
frequency was found after thousands of trials and is i
believe the exact frequency existing in the optic nerves
themselves-and sent to the receiving headset modu-
lated as it is and producing a three-dimensional picture
after rectification in the receiver it reproduces exactly
what has been viewed if due allowance has been made
for the size and configuration of the different brains in-
volved in the transfer you remember a sort of flash-a
skylark three



sensation of seeing something-when the educator
worked on you well you did see it just as though it
had been transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve but
everything came at once so the impression of sight was
confused the result in the brain however was clear
and permanent the only drawback is that you havent
the visual memory of what you have learned and that
sometimes makes it hard to use your knowledge you
dont know whether you know anything about a certain
subject or not until after you go digging around in your
brain looking for it

  i see said crane and dorothy the irrepressible
putin 

  just as clear as so much mud what are the im-
provements you added to the original design

  well you see i had a big advantage in knowing that
cerebrin was the substance involved and with that
knowledge i could carry matters considerably farther
than dunark could in his original model i can transfer
the thoughts of somebody else to a third party or to a
record dunarks machine couldnt work against resist-
ance-if the subject wasnt willing to give up his thoughts
he couldnt get them this one can take them away by
force in fact by increasing plate and grid voltages in
the amplifier i can pretty nearly burn out a mans brain
yesterday i was playing with it transferring a section of
my own brain to a magnetized tape-for a permanent
record you know-and found out that above certain
rather low voltages it becomes a form of torture that
would make the best efforts of the old inquisition seem
like a petting party

  did you succeed in the transfer  crane was in-
tensely interested

  sure  push the button for shiro and well start
something

  put your heads against this screen he directed when
shiro had come in smiling and bowing as usual ive
got to caliper your brains to do a good job

  the calipering done he adjusted various dials and
clamped the electrodes over his own head and over the
heads of crane and shiro

  want to learn japanese while were at it mart
im going to

   yes please i tried to learn it while i was in japan
but it was altogether too difficult to be worth while
seaton threw in a switch opened it depressed two
more opened them and threw off the power

  all set he reported crisply and barked a series of
explosive syllables at shiro ending upon a rising note

  yes sir answered the japanese you speak nip-
ponese as though you had never spoken any other tongue
i am very grateful to you sir that i may now discard
my dictionary

  how about you two girls-anything you want to learn
in a hurry 

  not me declared dorothy emphatically that ma-
chine is too darn weird to suit me besides if i knew as
much about science as you do wed probably fight about
at

  i do not believe i care to   began margaret
she was interrupted by the penetrating sound of an
alarm bell

  thats a new note exclaimed seaton i never
jieard that note before

  he stood in surprise at the board where a brilliant
purple light was flashing slowly great cat thats a
purely osnomian war-gadget-kind of a battleship de-

tector-shows that theres a boatload of bad news around
here somewhere grab the visiplates quick folks as he
rang shiros bell ill take visiplate area one dead
ahead mart take number two dot three peg four
shiro five look sharp    nothing in front see
anything any of you 

none of them could discover anything amiss but
the purple light continued to flash and the bell to
ring seaton cut off the bell

  were almost to x he thought aloud cant be
more than a million miles or so and were almost stopped
wonder if somebodys there ahead of us maybe dun-
ark is doing this though ill call him and see he
threw in a switch and said one word-dunark
here came the voice of the kofedix from the
speaker are you generating

  no-just called to see if you were what do you
make of it 

  nothing as yet better close up

  yes edge over this way and ill come over to meet
you leave your negative as it is-well be stopped di-
rectly whatever it is its dead ahead its a long ways
off yet but wed- better get organized wouldnt talk
much either-they may intercept our wave narrow as it
is

  better yet shut off your radio entirely when we
get close enough together well use the hand-language
you may not know that you know it but you do turn
your heaviest searchlight toward me-ill do the same
 there was a click as dunarks power was shut off
abruptly and seaton grinned as he cut his own

  thats right too folks in osnomian battles we al-
ways used a sign-language when we couldnt hear any-
thing-and that was most of the time i know it as well
as i know english now that i am reminded of the fact
he shifted his course to intercept that of the osnomian
vessel after a time the watchers picked out a minute
point of light moving comparatively rapidly against the
stars and knew it to be the searchlight of the kondal
soon the two vessels were almost side by side moving
cautiously forward and seaton set up a sixty-inch para-
bolic reflector focused upon a coil as they went on
the purple light continued to flash more and more rapidly
but still nothing was to be seen

  take number six visiplate will you mart its
telescopic equivalent to a twenty-inch refractor ill tell
you where to look in a minute-this reflector increases
the power of the regular indicator he studied meters
and adjusted dials set on nineteen hours forty-three
minutes and two hundred seventy-one degrees hes
too far away yet to read exactly but thatll put him in
the field of vision

  is this radiation harmful  asked margaret

  not yet-its too weak pretty soon we may be able
to feel it then ill throw out a screen against it when
its strong enough its pretty deadly stuff see anything
mart

  i see something but it is very indistinct it is moving
in sharper now yes it is a space-ship shaped like a
dirigible airship

  see it yet dunark seaton signaled

  just sighted it ready to attack

  i am not im going to run lets go and go fast
dunark signaled violently and seaton shook his head
time after time stubbornly
rm

amazing

stories

  a difficulty asked crane

  yes he wants to go jump on it but fm not looking
for trouble with any such craft as that-it must be a
thousand feet long and is certainly neither terrestrial
nor osnomn i say beat it while were all in one piece
how aboutit

absolutely concurred crane and both women
the bar was reversed and the skylark leaped away
the kondal followed although the observers could see
that dunark was raging seaton swung number six visi-
plate around looked once and switched on the radio

  well dunark he said grimly you get your wish
that bird is coming out with at least twice the accelera-
tion we could get with both motors full on he saw us
all the time and was waiting for us

  go on-get away if you can you can stand a higher
acceleration than we can well hold him as long as
possible

  i would if it would do any good but it wont hes
so much faster than we are that he could catch us any-
way if he wanted to no matter how much of a start we
had-and it looks now as though he wanted us two of
us stand a lot better chance than one of licking him if
hes looking for trouble spread out a mile or two and
pretend this is all the speed weve got whatll we give
him first

  give him everything at once rays six seven eight
nine and ten   crane with seaton began making
contacts rapidly but with precision heat wave two-
seven induction five-eight oscillation everything
under point oh six three all the explosive copper we
can get in right 

  right-and if worse comes to worst remember the
zone of force let him shoot first because he may be
peaceable-but it doesnt look like olive branches to me
got both your screens out

  yes mart you might take number two visiplate and
work the guns-ill handle the rest of this stuff better
strap yourselves in solid folks-this may develop into a
kind of rough party by the looks of things right now

as he spoke a pyrotechnic display enveloped the en-
tire ship as a radiation from the foreign vessel
struck the other neutralizing screen and dissipated its
force harmlessly in the ether instantly seaton threw on
the full power of his refrigerating system and shot in
the master switch that actuated the complex offensive
armament of his dreadnought of the skies an intense
livid violet glow hid completely main and auxiliary power
bars and long flashes leaped between metallic objects in
all parts of the vessel the passengers felt each hair
striving to stand on end as the very air became more and
more highly charged-and this was but the slight corona-
loss of the frightful stream of destruction being hurled at
the other space-cruiser now scarcely a mile away

  seaton stared into number one visiplate manipulating
levers and dials as he drove the skylark hither and yon
dodging frantically the while the automatic focusing de-
vices remained centered upon the enemy and the enor-
mous generators continued to pour forth their deadly
frequencies the bars glowed more fiercely as they were
advanced to full working load-the stranger was one
blaze of incandescent ionization but she still fought on
and seaton noticed that the pyrometers recording the
temperature of the shell were mounting rapidly in
spite of the refrigerators

  dunark put everything youve got upon one spot-
right on the end of his nose

  as the first shell struck the mark seaton concentrated
every force at his command upon the designated point
the air in the skylark crackled and hissed and intense
violet flames leaped from the bars as they were driven
almost to the point of disruption from the forward end
of the strange craft there erupted prominence after
prominence of searing unbearable flame as the terrific
charges of explosive copper struck the mark and ex-
ploded liberating instantaneously their millions upon mil-
lions of kilowatt-hours of intra-atomic energy each
prominence enveloped all three of the fighting vessels
and extended for hundreds of miles out into space-but
still the enemy warship continued to hurl forth solid and
vibratory destruction

  a brilliant orange light flared upon the panel and
seaton gasped as he swung his visiplate upon his de-
fenses which he had supposed impregnable his outer
screen was already down although its mighty copper
generator was exerting its utmost power black areas
had already appeared and were spreading rapidly where
there should have been only incandescent radiance and
the inner screen was even now radiating far into the
ultra-violet and was certainly doomed knowing as he
did the stupendous power driving those screens he knew
that there were superhuman and inconceivable forces be-
ing directed against them and his right hand flashed to
the switch controlling the zone of force fast as he was
much happened in the mere moment that passed before
his flying hand could close the switch in the last in-
finitesimal instant of time before the zone closed in a
gaping black hole appeared in the incandescence of the
inner screen and a small portion of a ray of energy so
stupendous as to be palpable struck like a tangible
projectile the exposed flank of the skylark instantly
the refractory arenak turned an intense dazzling white
and more than a foot of the forty-erght-inch skin of the
vessel melted away like snow before an oxy-acetylene
flame melting and flying away in molten globes and
sparkling gases-the refrigerating coils lining the hull
were of no avail against the concentrated energy of that
titanic thrust as seaton shut off his power intense
darkness and utter silence closed in and he snapped on
the lights

  they take one trick he blazed his eyes almost
emitting sparks and leaped for the generators he had
forgotten the efforts of the zone of forcehowever and
only sprawled grotesquely in the air until he floated
within reach of a line

  hold everything dick crane snapped as seaton
bent over one of the bars what are you going to do 

  im going to put as heavy bars in these ray-genera-
tors as theyll stand and go out and get that bird we
cant lick him with osnomian rays or with our explosive
copper but i can carve that sausage into slices with a
zone of force and im going to do it

  steady old man-take it easy i see your point
but remember that you must release the zone of force be-
fore you can use it as a weapon furthermore you must
discover his exact location and must get close enough to
him to use the zone as a weapon all without its protec-
tion can those ray-screens be made sufficiently power-
ful to withstand the beam they employed last even for a
second 

  hm  m  m never thought of that mart
skylark three



seaton replied the fire dying out of his eyes wonder
how long the battle lasted

  eight and two-tenths seconds from first to last but
they had had that heavy ray in action only a fraction of
one second when you cut in the zone of force either
they underestimated our strength at first or else it re-
quired about eight seconds to tune in their heavy genera-
tors-probably the former

  but weve got to do something man we cant just
sit here and twiddle our thumbs

  why and why not that course seems eminently
wise and proper in fact at the present time thumb-
fwiddling is distinctly indicated

  oh youre full of little red ants we cant do a
thing with that zone on-and you say just sit here sup-
pose they know all about that zone of force suppose
they can crack it  suppose they ram us 

  i shall take up your objections in order crane had
lighted a cigarette and was smoking meditatively first
they may or may not know about it at present that
point is immaterial second whether or not they know
about it it is almost a certainty that they cannot crack
it it had been up for more than three minutes and
they have undoubtedly concentrated everything possible
upon us during that time it is still standing i really
expected it to go down in the first few seconds but now
that it has held this long it will in all probability continue
to hold indefinitely third they most certainly will not
ram us for several reasons they probably have en-
countered few if any foreign vessels able to stand
against them for a minute and will act accordingly
then too it is probably safe to assume that their vessel
is damaged to some slight extent at least for i do not
believe that any possible armament could withstand the
forces you directed against them and escape entirely un-
scathed finally if they did ram us what would hap-
pen would we feel the shock that barrier in the
ether seems impervious and if so it could not transmit
a blow i do not see exactly how it would affect the
ship dealing the blow you are the one who works out
the new problems in unexplored mathematics-some time
you must take a few months off and work it out
yes it would take that long too i guess-but youre
right he cant hurt us thats using the old bean mart
i was going off half-cocked again darn it ill pipe
down and well go into a huddle

o	eaton noticed that dorothys face was white and
 that she was fighting for self-control drawing him-
self over to her he picked her up in a tight embrace

  cheer up red-top this mans war aint started
yet

  not started  what do you mean  havent you and
martin just been admitting to each other that you cant
do anything  doesnt that mean that we are beaten 
beaten us how do you get that way noton
your sweet young life he ejaculated and the surprise
on his face was so manifest that she recovered in-
stantly weve just dug a hole and pulled the hole in
after us thats all when we get everything doped out
to suit us well snap out of it and that birdll think hes
been petting a wildcat

  mart you re the thinking end of this partnership
he continued thoughtfully youve got the analytical
mind and the judicial disposition and can think circles
around me from what little youve seen of those folks

tell me who what and where they are im getting the
germ of an idea and maybe we can make it work

  i will try it crane paused they are of course
neither from the earth nor from osnome it is also
evident that they have solved the secret of intra-atomic
energy their vessels are not propelled as ours are-they
have so perfected that force that it acts upon every
particle of the structure and its contents    

  how do you figure that blurted seaton

  because of the acceleration they can stand nothing
even semi-human and probably nothing living could en-
dure it otherwise right

  yes-i never thought of that

  furthermore they are far from home for if they
were from anywhere nearby the osnomians would have
known of them-particularly since it is evident from the
size of the vessel that it is not a recent development with
them as it is with us since the green system is close to
the center of the galaxy it seems reasonable as a work-
ing hypothesis to assume that they are from some system
far from the center perhaps close to the outer edge
they are very evidently of a high degree of intelligence
they are also highly treacherous and merciless 
why asked dorothy who was listening eagerly
i deduce those characteristics from their unprovoked
attack upon peaceful ships vastly smaller and sup-
posedly of inferior armament and also from the nature
of that attack this vessel is probably a scout or an ex-
ploring ship since it seems to be alone it is not alto-
gether beyond the bounds of reason to imagine it upon a
voyage of discovery in search of new planets to be
subjugated and colonized   

  thats a sweet picture of our future neighbors-but
i guess youre hitting the old nail on the head at that
if these deductions are anywhere nearly correct
they are terrible neighbors for my next point are we
justified in assuming that they do or do not know about
the zone of force

  thats a hard one knowing what they evidently do
know its hard to see how they could have missed it
and yet if they had known about it for a long time
wouldnt they be able to get through it of course it
may be a real and total barrier in the ether-in that case
theyd know that they couldnt do a thing as long as we
keep it on take your choice but i believe that they
know about it and know more than we do-that it is a
total barrier set up in the ether

  i agree with you and we shall proceed upon that
assumption they know then that neither they nor
we can do anything as long as we maintain the zone-
that it is a stalemate they also know that it takes an
enormous amount of power to keep the zone in place
now we have gone as far as we can go upon the meager
data we have-considerably farther than we really are
justified in going we must now try to come to some
conclusion concerning their present activities if our
ideas as to their natures are even approximately correct
they are waiting probably fairly close at hand until we
shall be compelled to release the zone no matter how
long that period of waiting shall be they know of
course from our small size that we cannot carry enough
copper to maintain it indefinitely as ther could does
that sound reasonable

  i check you to nineteen decimal places mart and
from your ideas im getting surer and surer that we can
pull their corks i can get into action in a hurry when
amazing

stories

i have to and my idea now is to wait until they relax a
trifle and then slip a fast one over on them one more
bubble out of the old think-tank and ill let you off for
the day at what time will their vigilance be at lowest
ebb thats a poser ill admit but the answer to it
may answer everything-the first shot will of course
be the best chance well ever have

  yes we should succeed in the first attempt we
have very little information to guide us in answering
that question he studied the problem for many
minutes before he resumed i should say that for a
time they would keep all their rays and other weapons
in action against the zone of force expecting us to re-
lease it immediately then knowing that they were
wasting power uselessly they would cease attacking but
would be very watchful with every eye fastened upon
us and with every weapon ready for instant use after
this period of vigilance regular ships routine would be
resumed half the force probably would go off duty-
for if they are even remotely like any organic beings
with which we are familiar they require sleep or its
equivalent at intervals the men on duty-the normal
force that is-would be doubly careful for a time then
habit will assert itself if we have done nothing to create
suspicion and their watchfulness will relax to the point
of ordinary careful observation toward the end of
their watch because of the strain of the battle and be-
cause of the unusually long period of duty they will be-
come careless and their vigilance will be considerably
below normal but the exact time of all these things de-
pends entirely upon their conception of time concerning
which we have no information whatever though it is
purely a speculation based upon earthly and osnomian
experience i should say that after twelve or thirteen
hours would come the time for us to make the attack
thats good enough for me fine mart and thanks
youve probably saved the lives of the party we will
now sleep for eleven or twelve hours

  sleep dick how could you  dorothy exclaimed

            chapter v
            first blood

the next twelve hours dragged with terrible slow-
ness sleep was impossible and eating was diffi-
cult even though all knew that they would have
need of the full measure of their strength seaton set
up various combinations of switching devices connected
to electrical timers and spent hours trying with all his
marvelous quickness of muscular control to cut shorter
and ever shorter the time between the opening and the
closing of the switch at last he arranged a powerful
electro-magnetic device so that one impulse would both
open and close the switch with an open period of one
one-thousandth of a second only then was he satisfied

  a thousandth is enough to give us a look around
due to persistence of vision and it is short enough so
that they wont see it unless they have a recording ob-
server on us even if they still have rays on us they
cant possibly neutralize our screens in that short an ex-
posure all right gang well take five visiplates and
cover the sphere if any of you get a glimpse of him
mark the exact spot and outline on the glass all set 
he pressed the button the stars flashed in the black
yoid for an instant then were again shut out

  here he is dick shrieked margaret right here-
he covered almost half the visiplate

  she outlined for him as nearly as she could the exact
position of the object she had seen and he calculated
rapidly

  fine business he exulted hes within half a
mile of us three-quarters on-perfect i thought hed
be so far away that id have to take photographs to lo-
cate him he hasnt a single ray on us either that
birds goose is cooked right now folks unless every man
on watch has his hand right on the controls of a genera-
tor and can get into action in less than a tenth of a
second hang on gang im going to step on the gas
after making sure that everyone was fastened im-
movably in their seats he strapped himself in the pilots
seat then set the bar toward the strange vessel and ap-
plied fully one-third of its full power the skylark of
course did not move then with bewildering rapidity
he went into action face glued to the visiplate hands
moving faster than the eye could follow-the left clos-
ing and opening the switch controlling the zone of force
the right swinging the steering controls to all points of
the sphere the mighty vessel staggered this way and
that jerking and straining terribly as the zone was
thrown on and off lurching sickeningly about the central
bearing as the gigantic power of the driving bar was
exerted now in one direction now in another after a
second or two of this mad gyration seaton shut off the
power he then released the zone after assuring himself
that both inner and outer screens were operating at the
highest possible rating

  there thatll hold em for a while i guess this
battle was even shorter than the other one-and a lot
more decisive lets turn on the flood-lights and see
what the pieces look like

  the lights revealed that the zone of force had indeed
sliced the enemy vessel into pieces no fragment was
large enough to be navigable or dangerous and each was
sharply cut as though sheared from its neighbor by
some gigantic curved blade dorothy sobbed with relief
in seatons arms as crane with one arm around his wife
grasped his hand

  that was flawless dick as an exhibition of perfect
co-ordination and instantaneous timing under extreme
physical difficulties i have never seen its equal

you certainly saved all our lives margaret added
only fifty-fifty peg seaton protested and blushed
vividly mart did most of it you know id have
gummed up everything back there if he had let me
lets see what we can find out about them

  he touched the lever and the skylark moved slowly
toward the wreckage the scattered fragments of which
were beginning to move toward and around each other
because of their mutual gravitational forces snapping
on a searchlight he swung its beam around and as it
settled upon one of the larger sections he saw a group of
hooded figures some of them upon the metal others
floating slowly toward it through space

  poor devils-they didnt have a chance he remarked
regretfully however it was either they or we-look
out sweet spirits of niter

  he leaped back to the controls and the others were
hurled bodily to the floor as he applied the power-for at
a signal each of the hooded figures had leveled a tube and
once more the outer screen had flamed into incandescence

  as the skylark leaped away seaton focussed an attractor
skylark three



upon the one who had apparently signaled the attack
rolling the vessel over in a short loop so that the cap-
tive was hurled off into space upon the other side he
snatched the tube from the figures grasp with one aux-
iliary attractor and anchored head and limbs with others
so that the prisoner could scarcely move a muscle then
while crane and the women scrambled up off the floor
and hurried to the visiplates seaton cut in rays six two-
seven and five-eight ray six the softener was a
band of frequencies extending from violet far up into
the ultra-violet when driven with sufficient power
this ray destroyed eyesight and nervous tissue and its
power increased still further actually loosened the mole-
cular structure of matter ray two-seven was operated
in a range of frequencies far below the visible red it
was pure heat-under its action matter became hotter
and hotter as long as it was applied the upper limit be-
ing only the theoretical maximum of temperature ray
five-eight was high-tension high-frequency alternating
current any conductor in its path behaved precisely
as it would in the ajax-northrup induction furnace
which can boil platinum in ten seconds these three
rays composed the beam which seaton directed upon the
mass of metal from which the enemy had elected to con-
tinue the battle-and behind each ray instead of the
small energy at the command of its osnomian inventor
were the untold millions of kilowatts developed by a one-
hundred-pound bar of disintegrating copper

  i here ensued a brief but appalling demonstration
of the terrible effectiveness of those osnomian
weapons against anything not protected by ultra-powered
ray screens metal and men-if men they were-lit-
erally vanished one moment they were outlined
starkly in the beam there was a moment of searing
coruscating blinding light-the next moment the beam
bored on into the void unimpeded nothing was visible
save an occasional tiny flash as some condensed or solidi-
fied droplet of the volatilized metal re-entered the path
of that ravening beam

  well see if theres any more of them loose seaton
remarked as he shut off the force and probed into the
wreckage with a searchlight

  no sign of life or of activity was revealed and the
light was turned upon the captive he was held motion-
less in the invisible grip of the attractors at the point
where the force of those peculiar magnets was exactly
balanced by the outward thrust of the repellers by
manipulating the attractor holding it seaton brought the
strange tubular weapon into the control-room through a
small air-lock in the wall and examined it curiously but
did not touch it

  i never heard of a hand-ray before so i guess i
wont play with it much until after i learn something
about it

  so you have taken a captive asked margaret
what are you going to do with him 

  im going to drag him in here and read his mind
hes one of the officers of that ship i believe and im
going to find out how to build one exactly like it this
old can is now as obsolete as a  flivver and im going
to make us a later model how about it mart dont we
want something really up-to-date if were going to keep
on space-hopping

  we gertainly do those denizens seem to be par-
ticularly venomous and we will not be safe unless we

have the most powerful and most efficient space-ship
possible however that fellow may be dangerous even
now-in fact it is practically certain that he is

  you chirped it ace id much rather touch a pound
of dry nitrogen iodide ive got him spread-eagled so
that he cant destroy his brain until after weve read it
though so theres no particular hurry about him well
leave him out there for a while to waste his sweetness
on the desert air lets all look around for the kondal
i sure hope they didnt get her in that fracas

  they diffused the rays of eight giant searchlights
into a vertical fan and with it swept slowly through al-
most a semi-circle before anything was seen then there
was revealed a cluster of cylindrical objects amid a mass
of wreckage which crane recognized at once

  the kondal is gone dick there is what is left of
her and most of her cargo of salt in jute bags

  as he spoke a series of green flashes played upon the
bags and seaton yelled in relief

  they got the ship all right but dunark and sitar got
away-theyre still with their salt

  the skylark moved over to the wreck and seaton re-
linquishing the controls to crane donned a vacuum suit
entered the main air-lock and snapped on the motor
which sealed off the lock pumped the air into a pres-
sure-tank and opened the outside door he threw a light
line to the two figures and pushed himself lightly toward
them he then talked briefly to dunark in the hand-
language and handed the end of the line to sitar who
held it while the two men explored the fragments of the
strange vessel gathering up various things of interest as
they came upon them

  back in the control-room dunark and sitar let their
pressure decrease gradually to that of the terrestrial ves-
sel and removed the face-plates from their helmets

  again oh karfedo of earth we thank you for our
lives dunark began gasping for breath when seaton
leaped to the air-gauge with a quick apology

  never thought of the effect our atmospheric pressure
would have on you two we can stand yours all right
but youd pretty nearly pass out on ours there thatll
suit you better didnt you throw out your zone of
force 

  yes as soon as i saw that our screens were not going
to hold the osnomians labored breathing became
normal as the air-pressure increased to a value only a
little below that of the dense atmosphere of their native
planet i then increased the power of the screens to the
extreme limit and opened the zone for a moment to see
how the screens would hold with the added power
that instant was enough in that period a con-
centrated beam such as i had no idea could ever be
generated went through the outer and inner screens as
though they were not there through the four-foot arenak
of the hull through the entire central installation and
through the hull on the other side sitar and i were
wearing suits 

  say mart thats one bet we overlooked its a good
idea too-those strangers wore them all the time as
regular equipment apparently next time we get into
a jam be sure we do it they might come in handy ex-
cuse me dunark-go ahead

  we had suits on so as soon as the ray was shut off
which was almost instantly i phoned the crew to jump
and we leaped out through the hole in the hull the air
rushing out gave us an impetus that carried us many


amazing

stories

miles out into space and it required many hours for the
slight attraction of the mass here to draw us back to it
we just got back a few minutes ago that air-blast is
probably what saved us as they destroyed our vessel
with atomic bombs and hunted down the four men of
our crew who stayed comparatively close to the scene
they rayed you for about an hour with the most stu-
pendous beams imaginable-no such generators have
ever been considered possible of construction-but
couldnt make any impression upon you then they
shut off their power and stood by waiting i wasnt
looking at you when you released your zone one mo-
ment it was there and the next the stranger had been
cut in pieces the rest you know

  were sure glad you two got away dunark well
mart what say we drag that guy in and give him the
once-over 

o	eaton swung the attractors holding the prisoner
until they were in line with the main air-lock then
reduced the power of the repellers as he approached
the lock various controls were actuated and soon the
stranger stood in the control room held immovable
against one wall while crane with a -caliber ele-
phant gun stood against the other

  perhaps you girls should go somewhere else sug-
gested crane

  not on your life protested dorothy who eyes wide
and flushed with excitement stood near a door with a
heavy automatic pistol in her hand i wouldnt miss
this for a farm

  got him solid declared seaton after a careful in-
spection of the various attractors and repellers he had
bearing upon the prisoner now lets get him out of
that suit no-better read his air first temperature and
pressure-might analyze it too

  nothing could be seen of the person of the stranger
since he was encased in vacuum armor but it was plainly
evident that he was very short and immensely broad and
thick by means of hollow needles forced through the
leather-like material of the suit seaton drew off a sample
of the atmosphere within into an orsat apparatus while
crane made pressure and temperature readings

  temperature one hundred ten degrees pressure
twenty-eight pounds-about the same as ours is now that
we have stepped it up to keep the osnomians from suf-
fering

  seaton soon reported that the atmosphere was quite
similar to that of the skylark except that it was much
higher in carbon dioxide and carried an extremely high
percentage of water vapor he took up a pair of heavy
shears and laid the suit open full length on both sides
knowing that the powerful attractors would hold the
stranger immovable he then wrenched off the helmet
and cast the whole suit aside revealing the enemy officer
clad in a tunic of scarlet silk

  he was less than five feet tall his legs were merely
blocks fully as great in diameter as they were in length
supporting a torso of herculean dimensions his arms
were as large as a strong mans thigh and hung almost to
the floor his astounding shoulders fully a yard across
merged into and supported an enormous head the
being possessed recognizable nose ears and mouth and
the great domed forehead and huge cranium bespoke an
immense and a highly developed brain

  but it was the eyes of this strange creature that fixed

and held the attention large they were and black-
the dull opaque lusterless black of platinum sponge
the pupils were a brighter black and in them flamed
ruby lights pitiless mocking cold plainly to be read
in those sinister depths were the untold wisdom of un-
thinkable age sheer ruthlessness mighty power and
ferocity unrelieved his baleful gaze swept from one
member of the party to another and to meet the glare of
those eyes was to receive a tangible physical blow-it
was actually ponderable force that of embodied hardness
and of ruthlessness incarnate generated in that merci-
less brain and hurled forth through those flame-shot
stygian orbs

  if you dont need us for anything dick i think
peggy and i will go upstairs dorothy broke the long
silence

  good idea dot this isnt going to be pretty to
watch-or to do either for that matter

  if i stay here another minute ill see that thing as
long as i live and i might be very ill goodbye and
heartless and bloodthirsty osnomian though she was
sitar had gone to join the two terrestrial women

  i didnt want to say much before the girls but i
want to check a couple of ideas with you two dont you
think its a safe bet that this bird reported back to his
headquarters 

  i have been thinking that very thing crane spoke
gravely and dunark nodded agreement any race
capable of developing such a vessel as this would almost
certainly have developed systems of communication in
proportion

  thats the way i doped it out-and thats why im
going to read his mind if i have to burn out his brain
to do it weve got to know how far away from home
he is whether he has turned in any report about us and
all about it also im going to get the plans power and
armament of their most modern ships if he knows
them so that your gang dunark can build us one
like them because the next boat that tackles us will be
warned and we wont be able to take it by surprise we
wont stand a chance in the skylark with a ship like
theirs however we can run-or we can fight if we have
to any other ideas fellows

as neither crane nor dunark had any other sugges-

-	tions to offer seaton brought out the mechanical
educator watching the creatures eyes narrowly as he
placed one headset over that motionless head the captive
sneered in pure contempt but when the case was opened
and the array of tubes and transformers was revealed
that expression disappeared and when he added a super-
power stage by cutting in a heavy-duty transformer and
a five-kilowatt transmitting tube seaton thought that he
saw an instantaneously suppressed flicker of doubt or
fear

  that headset thing was childs play to him but he
doesnt like the looks of this other stuff at all i dont
blame him a bit-i wouldnt like to be on the receiving
end of this hook-up myself im going to put him on the
recorder and on the visualizer seaton continued as he
connected spools of wire and tape lamps and lenses in
an intricate system and donned a headset id hate to
have much of that brain in my own skull-afraid id
bite myself im just going to look on and when i see
anything i want ill grab it and put it into my own brain
im starting off easy not using the big tube
skylark three

m

  he closed several switches lights flashed and the
wires and tapes began to feed through the magnets

  well ive got his language folks he seemed to want
me to have it its got a lot of stuff in it that i cant
understand yet though so guess ill give him some
english

  he changed several connections and the captive spoke
in a profoundly deep bass voice

  you may as well discontinue your attempt for you
will gain no information from me that machine of
yours was out of date with us thousands of years ago

  save your breath or talk sense said seaton coldly
i gave you english so that you can give me the informa-
tion i want you already know what it is when you
get ready to talk say so or throw it on the screen of
your own accord if you dont ill put on enough volt-
age to burn your brain out remember i can read your
dead brain as well as though it were alive but i want
your thoughts as well as your knowledge and im going
to have them if you give them voluntarily i will tinker
up a lifeboat that you can navigate back to your own
world and let you go if you resist i intend getting them
anyway and you shall not leave this vessel alive you
may take your choice

  you are childish and that machine is impotent
against my will i could have defied it a hundred years
ago when i was barely a grown man know you
american that we supermen of the fenachrone are as
far above any of the other and lesser breeds of beings
who spawn in their millions in their countless myriads of
races upon the numberless planets of the universe as
you are above the inert metal from which this your ship
was built the universe is ours and in due course we
shall take it-just as in due course i shall take this vessel
do your worst i shall not speak the creatures eyes
flamed hurling a wave of hypnotic command through
seatons eyes and deep into his brain seatons very
senses reeled for an instant under the impact of that
awful mental force but after a short intensely bitter
struggle he threw off the spell

  that was close fellow but you didnt quite ring the
bell he said grimly staring directly into those unholy
eyes i may rate pretty low mentally but i cant be
hypnotized into turning you loose also i can give you
cards and spades in certain other lines which i am about
to demonstrate being supermen didnt keep the rest of
your men from going out in my ray and being a super-
man isnt going to save your brain i am not depending
upon my intellectual or mental force-ive got an ace in
the hole in the shape of five thousand volts to apply to
the most delicate centers of your brain start giving me
what i want and start quick or ill tear it out of you

  the giant did not answer merely glared defiance and
bitter hate

  take it then seaton snapped and cut in the super-
power stage and began turning dials and knobs explor-
ing that strange mind for the particular area in which
he was most interested he soon found it and cut in
the visualizer-the stereographic device in parallel with
seatons own brain recorder which projected a three-
dimensional picture into the viewing-area or dark
space of the cabinet crane and dunark tense and
silent looked on in strained suspense as minute after
minute the silent battle of wills raged upon one side
was a horrible and gigantic brain of undreamed of
power upon the other side a strong man fighting for all

that life holds dear wielding against that monstrous and
frightful frrain a weapon wrought of high-tension elec-
tricity applied with all the skill that earthly and osno-
mian science could devise

   seaton crouched over the amplifier his jaw set and
every muscle taut his eyes leaping from one meter to
another his right hand slowly turning up the potentio-
meter which was driving more and ever more of the sear-
ing torturing output of his super-power tube into that
stubborn brain the captive was standing utterly rigid
eyes closed every sense and faculty mustered to resist
that cruelly penetrant attack upon the very innermost
recesses of his mind crane and dunark scarcely
breathed as the three-dimensional picture in the visual-
izer varied from a blank to the hazy outlines of a giant
space-cruiser it faded out as the unknown exerted him-
self to withstand that poignant inquisition only to come
back in clearer than before as seaton advanced the po-
tentiometer still farther finally flesh and blood could
no longer resist that lethal probe and the picture became
sharp and clear it showed the captain-for he was
no less an officer than the commander of the vessel-at
a great council table seated together with many other
officers upon very low enormously strong metal stools
they were receiving orders from their emperor orders
plainly understood by crane and the osnomian alike for
thought needs no translation

  gentlemen of the navy the ruler spoke solemnly
our preliminary expedition returned some time ago
achieved its every aim and we are now ready to begin
fulfilling our destiny the conquest of the universe
this galaxy comes first our base of operations will
be the largest planet of that group of brilliant green suns
for they can be seen from any point in the galaxy and
are almost in the exact center of it our astronomers
here the captains thoughts shifted briefly to an observa-
tory far out in space for perfect seeing and portrayed a
reflecting telescope with a mirror five miles in diameter
capable of penetrating unimaginable myriads of light-
years into space have tabulated all the suns planets
and satellites belonging to this galaxy and each of you
has been given a complete chart and assigned a certain
area which he is to explore remember gentlemen that
this first major expedition is to be purely one of explora-
tion the one of conquest will set out after you have re-
turned with complete information you will each re-
port by torpedo every tenth of the year we do not an-
ticipate any serious difficulty as we are of course the
highest type of life in the universe nevertheless in the
unlikely event of trouble report it we shall do the rest
 in conclusion i warn you again--let no people know
that we exist make no conquests and destroy all who
by any chance may see you gentlemen go with power

   the captain embarked in a small airboat and was shot
to his vessel he took his station at an immense control
board and the warship shot off instantly with unthink-
able velocity and with not the slightest physical shock

   at this point seaton made the captain take them all
over the ship they noted its construction its power-
plant its controls-every minute detail of structure
operation and maintenance was taken from the captains
mind and was both recorded and visualized

the journey seemed to be a very long one but finally
the cluster of green suns became visible and the
fenachrone began to explore the solar systems in the


amazing stories

area assigned to that particular vessel hardly had the
survey started however when the two globular space-
cruisers were detected and located the captain stopped
the ship briefly then attacked they watched the at-
tack and saw the destruction of the kondal they
looked on while the captain read the brain of one of
dunarks crew gleaning from it all the facts concerning
the two space-ships and thought with him that the two
absentees from the kondal would drift back in a few
hours and would be disposed of in due course they
learned that these things were automatically impressed
upon the torpedo next to issue as was every detail of
everything that happened in and around the vessel they
watched him impress a thought of his own upon the
record-the inhabitants of planet three of sun six four
seven three pilarone show unusual development and may
cause trouble as they have already brought knowledge of
the metal of power and of the impenetrable shield to the
central system which is to be our base recommend
volatilization of this planet by vessel sent on special
mission they saw the raying of the skylark they
sensed him issue commands

  ray it for a time he will probably open the shield for
a moment as the other one did then after a time
skipped over by the mind under examination cease
raying-no use wasting power he must open eventu-
ally as he runs out of power stand by and destroy
him when he opens

  the scene shifted the captain was asleep and was
awakened by an alarm gong-only to find himself float-
ing in a mass of wreckage making his way to the frag-
ment of his vessel containing the torpedo port he re-
leased the messenger which flew with ever-increasing
velocity back to the capital city of the fenachrone carry-
ing with it a record of everything that had happened

  thats what i want thought seaton those tor-
pedos went home fast i want to know how far they
have to go and how long itll take them to get there you
know what distance a parsec is since it is purely a math-
ematical concept and you must have a watch or some
similar instrument with which we can translate your
years into ours i dont want to have to kill you fellow
and if youll give up even now ill spare you ill get it
anyway you know-and you also know that a few
hundred volts more will kill you

  they saw the thought received and saw its answer
you shall learn no more this is the most important
of all and i shall hold it to disintegration and beyond
seaton advanced the potentiometer still farther and
the brain picture waxed and waned strengthened and
faded finally however it was revealed by flashes that
the torpedo had about a hundred and fifty-five thousand
parsecs to go and that it would take two-tenths of a year
to make the journey that the warships which would come
in answer to the message were as fast as the torpedo
that he did indeed have in his suit a watch-a device of
seven dials each turning ten times as fast as its succes-
sor  and that one turn of the slowest dial measured one
year of his time seaton instantly threw off his headset
and opened the power switch

  grab a stopwatch quick mart he called as he
leaped to the discarded vacuum suit and searched out the
peculiar timepiece they noted the exact time consumed
by one complete revolution of one of the dials and cal-
culated rapidly

  better than i thought exclaimed seaton that

makes his year about four hundred ten of our days that
gives us eighty-two days before the torpedo gets there-
longer than id dared hope weve got to fight too not
run they figure on getting the skylark then volatiliz-
ing our world well we can take time enough to grab
off an absolutely complete record of this guys brain
well need it for whats coming and im going to get it
if i have to kill him to do it

   he resumed his place at the educator turned on the
power and a shadow passed over his face

   poor devil hes conked out-couldnt stand the gaff
he remarked half-regretfully however that makes
it easy to get what we want and wed have had to kill
him anyway i guess-bad as it is id hate to bump him
off in cold blood

  he threaded new spools into the machine and for
three hours mile after mile of tape sped between the
magnets as seaton explored every recess of that mon-
strous yet stupendous brain

   well thats that he declared finally as the last bit
of information gleaned and recorded upon the flying
tape he removed the body of the fenachrone captain
into space and rayed it out of existence now what
to do

   how can we get this salt to osnome asked dunark
whose thoughts were never far from that store of the
precious chemical you are already crowded and
sitar and i will crowd you still more you have no
room for additional cargo and yet much valuable time
would be lost in going to osnome for another vessel

   yes and weve got to get a lot of x too guess
well have to take time to get another vessel id like to
drag in the pieces of that ship too-his instruments and
a lot of the parts could be used

  why not do it all at once  suggested crane we
can start that whole mass toward osnome by drawing
it behind us until such a velocity has been attained that
it will reach there at the desired time we could then go
to x and overtake this material near the green system

  right you are ace-thats a sound idea but say
dunark it wouldnt be good technique for you to eat
our food for any length of time while were figuring
this out youd better hop over there and bring over
enough to last you two until we get you home give it
to shiro-after a couple of lessons youll find hell be
as good as any of your cooks

caster and faster the skylark flew pulling be-
- hind her the mass of wreckage held by every avail-
able attractor when the calculated velocity had been
attained the attractors were shut off and the vessel
darted away toward that planet still in the carbonifer-
ous age which possessed at least one solid ledge of
metallic x the rarest of all earthly metals as the
automatic controls held the cruiser upon her course the
six wanderers sat long in discussion as to what should be
done what could be done to avert the threatened de-
struction of all the civilization of the galaxy except the
monstrous and unspeakable culture of the fenachrone
nearing their destination seaton rose to his feet

   well folks its like this weve got our backs to
the wall dunark has troubles of his own-if the third
planet doesnt get him the fenachrone will and the
third planet is the more pressing danger that lets him
out weve got nearly six months before the fenachrone
can get back here 
skylark three



  but how can they possibly find us here or wherever
well be by that time dick  asked dorothy the battle
was a long way from here

  with that much start they probably couldnt find
us seaton replied soberly its the world im think-
ing about theyve got to be stopped and stopped cold
-and weve got only six months to do it in    os-
nomes got the best tools and the fastest workmen i
know of his voice died away in thought

  that sort of thing is in your department dick
crane was calm and judicial as always i will of
course do anything i can but you probably have a
plan of campaign already laid out

  after a fashion weve got to find out how to work
through this zone of force or were sunk without a trace
even with rays screens and ships equal to theirs we
couldnt keep them from sending a vessel to destroy the
earth and theyd probably get us too eventually
theyve got a lot of stuff we dont know about of
course since i took only one mans mind while he was
a very able man he didnt know all that all the rest of
them do any more than any one man has all the earthly
science known absolutely our only chance is to con-
trol that zone-its the only thing they havent got of
course it may be impossible but i wont believe that
until ive exhausted a lot of possibilities dunark can
you spare a crew to build us a duplicate of that fena-
chrone ship besides those you are going to build for
yourself 

  certainly i will be only too glad to do so

  well then while dunark is doing that i suggest
that we go to this third planet abduct a few of their
leading scientists and read their minds then do the
same visiting every other highly advanced planet we
can locate there is a good chance that by combining
the best points of the warfares of many worlds we can
evolve something that will enable us to turn back these
invaders

  why not send a copper torpedo to destroy their
entire planet suggested dunark 

  wouldnt work their detecting screens would lo-
cate it a thousand million miles off in space and they
would ray it with a zone of force that would get
through their screens that would be the first thing id
do you see every thought comes back to that zone
weve got to get through it some way

  the course alarm sounded and they saw that a planet
lay directly in their path it was x and enough nega-
tive acceleration was applied to make an easy landing
possible

  isnt it going to be a long slow job chopping off two
tons of that metal and fighting away those terrible ani-
mals besides  asked margaret

  itll take about a millionth of a second peg im
going to bite it off with the zone just as i took that
bite out of our field the rotation of the planet will
throw us away from the surface then well release the
zone and drag our prey off with us see 

  the skylark descended rapidly toward that well-
remembered ledge of metal to which the object compass
had led them

  this is exactly where we landed before margaret
commented in surprise and dorothy added

  yes and theres that horrible tree that ate the din-
osaur or whatever it was i thought you blew it up for
me dick

  i did dottie-blew it into atoms must be a good

location for carnivorous trees-and they must grow
awfully fast too as to its being the same place peg
-sure it is thats what object compasses are for
everything appeared as it had been at the time of
their first visit the rank carboniferous vegetation in-
tensely vividly green was motionless in the still hot
heavy air the living nightmares inhabiting that primi-
tive world were lying in the cooler depths of the jungle
sheltered from the torrid rays of that strange and fervent
sun

  how about it dot want to see some of your little
friends again if you do ill give them a shot and
bring them out

  heavens no i saw them once-if i never see them
again that will be twenty minutes too soon

  all right-well grab us a piece of this ledge and
beat it

  seaton lowered the vessel to the ledge focussed the
main anchoring attractor upon it and threw on the zone
of force almost immediately he released the zone
pointed the bar parallel to the compass bearing upon
osnome and slowly applied the power

  how much did you take anyway asked dunark
in amazement it looks bigger than the skylark
it is considerably bigger thought we might as well
take enough while were here so i set the zone for a
seventy-five-foot radius its probably of the order of
magnitude of half a million tons since the stuff weighs
more than half a ton to the cubic foot however we
can handle it as easily as we could a smaller bite and
that much mass will help us hold that other stuff together
when we catch up with it

the voyage to osnome was uneventful they over-
took the wreckage true to schedule as they were ap-
proaching the green system and attached it to the mass
of metal behind them by means of attractors

  wherell we land this junk dunark asked seaton
as osnome grew large beneath them well hold this
lump of metal and the fragment of the ship carrying the
salt and well be able to hold some of the most im-
portant of the other stuff but a lot of it is bound to
get away from us-and the lord help anybody whos
under it when it comes down you might yell for help-
and say you might ask somebody to have that astronom-
ical data ready for us as soon as we land

  the parade ground will be empty now so we will
land there dunark replied we should be able to
land everything in a field of that size i should think
he touched the sender at his belt and in the general code
notified the city of their arrival and warned everyone to
keep away from the parade ground he then sent
several messages in the official code concluding by asking
that one or two space-ships come out and help lower
the burden to the ground as the peculiar pulsating
chatter of the osnomian telegraph died out seaton called
for help

  come here you two and grab some of these attrac-
tors i need about twelve hands to keep this plunder
in the straight and narrow path

  the course had been carefully laid with allowance
for the various velocities and forces involved to fol-
low the easiest path to the kondalian parade ground
the hemisphere of x and the fragment of the kondal
which bore the salt were held immovably in place by the
main attractor and one auxiliary and many other auxil-
iaries held sections of the fenachrone vessel however


amazing stories

the resistance of the air seriously affected the trajectory
of many of the irregularly shaped smaller masses of
metal and all three men were kept busy flicking at-
tractors right and left capturing those strays which
threatened to veer off into the streets or upon the build-
ings of the kondalian capital city and shifting from one
piece to another so that none should fall freely two
sister-ships of the kondal appeared as if by magic in
answer to dunarks call and their attractors aided
greatly in handling the unruly collection of wreckage
a few of the smaller sections and a shower of debris
fell clear however in spite of all efforts and their ap-
proach was heralded by a meteoric display unprecedent-
ed in that world of continuous daylight

  as the three vessels with their cumbersome convoy
dropped down into the lower atmosphere the guns of
the city roared a welcome banners and pennons waved
the air became riotous with color from hundreds of pro-
jectors and odorous with a bewildering variety of scents
while all around them played numberless aircraft of all
descriptions and sizes the space below them was care-
fully avoided but on all sides and above them the air was
so full that it seemed marvelous that no collision oc-
curred tiny one-man helicopters little more than single
chairs flying about beautiful pleasure-planes soaring
and wheeling immense multiplane liners and giant heli-
copter freighters-everything in the air found occasion
to fly as near as possible to the skylark in order to dip
their flags in salute to dunark their kofedix and to
seaton the wearer of the seven disks-their revered
overlord

  finally the freight was landed without serious mishap
and the skylark leaped to the landing dock upon the
palace roof where the royal family and many nobles
were waiting in full panoply of glittering harness dun-
ark and sitar disembarked and the four others stepped
out and stood at attention as seaton addressed roban
the karfedix

  sir we greet you but we cannot stop even for a
moment you know that only the most urgent necessity
would make us forego the pleasure of a brief rest be-
neath your roof-the kofedix will presently give you
the measure of that dire need we shall endeavor to re-
turn soon greetings and for a time farewell

  overlord we greet you and trust that soon we may
entertain you and profit from your companionship for
what you have done we thank you may the great
first cause smile upon you until your return fare-
well 

chapter vi
the peace conference

 t t eres a chart of the green system mart with
i-i all the motions and the rest of the dope that
j x theyve been able to get howd it be for you
to navigate us over to the third planet of the fourteenth
sun 

  while you build a fenachrone super-generator
right the first time your deducer is hitting on
all eight as usual that big ray is hot stuff and their
ray-screen is something to write home about too

  how can their rays be any hotter than ours dick
dorothy asked curiously i thought you said we had
the very last word in rays

  i thought we had but those birds we met back there

spoke a couple of later words their rays work on an
entirely different system than the one we use they
generate an extremely short carrier wave like the milli-
kan cosmic ray by recombining some of the electrons and
protons of their disintegrating metal and upon this wave
they impose a pure heat frequency of terrific power
the millikan rays will penetrate anything except a
special ray screen or a zone of force and carry with
them-somewhat as radio frequencies carry sound fre-
quencies-the heat rays which volatilize anything they
touch their ray screens are a lot better than ours too-
they generate the entire spectrum its a sweet system
and when we revamp ours so as to be just like it well
be able to talk turkey to those folks on the third planet
how long will it take you to build it asked crane
who dexterously turning the pages of vegas hand-
buch was calculating their course

  a day or so-maybe less ive got all the stuff
and with my osnomian tools it wont take long if you
find youll get there before i get done youll have to
loaf a while-kill a little time

  are you going to connect the power plant to operate
on the entire vessel and all its contents 

  no-cant do it without redesigning the whole thing
and thats hardly worth while for the short time well
use this old bus

  building those generators would have been a long
and difficult task for a corps of earthly mechanics and
electricians but to seaton it was merely a job the
shop had been enlarged and had been filled to capacity
with osnomian machinery machine tools that were
capable of performing automatically and with the utmost
precision and speed any conceivable mechanical opera-
tion he put a dozen of them to work and before the
vessel reached its destination the new offensive and
defensive weapons had been installed and thoroughly
tested he had added a third screen-generator so that
now in addition to the four-foot hull of arenak and the
repellers warding off any material projectile the sky-
lark was also protected by an outer an intermediate and
an inner ray-screen each driven by the super-power
of a four-hundred-pound bar and each covering the
entire spectrum-capable of neutralizing any dangerous
frequency known to those master-scientists the fena-
chrone

  as the skylark approached the planet seaton swung
number six visiplate upon it and directed their flight
toward a great army base darting down upon it he
snatched an officer into the airlock closed the door
and leaped back into space he brought the captive into
the control room pinioned by auxiliary attractors and
relieved him of his weapons he then rapidly read his
mind encountering no noticeable resistance released the
attractors and addressed him in his own language

  please be seated lieutenant seaton said courteously
motioning him to one of the seats we come in peace
please pardon my discourtesy in handling you but it
was necessary in order to learn your language and thus
to get in touch with your commanding officer

  the officer overcome with astonishment that he had
not been killed instantly sank into the seat indicated
without a reply and seaton went on

  please be kind enough to signal your commanding
officer that we are coming down at once for a peace
conference by the way i can read your signals and
will send them myself if necessary

  the stranger worked an instrument attached to his
skylark three



harness briefly and the skylark descended slowly toward
the fortress

  i know of course that your vessels will attack
seaton remarked as he noted a crafty gleam in the eyes
of the officer i intend to let them use all their power
for a time to prove to them the impotence of their
weapons after that i shall tell you what to say to
them

  do you think this is altogether safe dick asked
crane as they saw a fleet of gigantic airships soaring
upward to meet them

  nothing sure but death and taxes returned seaton
cheerfully but dont forget that weve got fenachrone
armament now instead of osnomian im betting that
they cant begin to drive their rays through even our
outer screen and even if our outer screen should begin
to go into the violet-i dont think it will even go
cherry-red-out goes our zone of force and we auto-
matically go up where no possible airship can reach
since their only space-ships are rocket driven and of
practically no maneuverability they stand a big chance
of getting to us anyway we must get in touch with
them to find out if they know anything we dont and
this is the only way i know of to do it besides i want
to head dunark off from wrecking this world theyre
exactly the same kind of folks he is you notice and
i dont like civil war any suggestions keep an eye
on that bird then mart and well go down

the skylark dropped down into the midst of the
fleet which instantly turned against her the full
force of their giant guns and their immense ray bat-
teries seaton held the skylark motionless staring into
his visiplate his right hand grasping the zone-switch

  the outer screen isnt even getting warm he ex-
ulted after a moment the repellers were hurling the
shells back long before they reached even the outer
screen and they were exploding harmlessly in the air
the full power of the ray-generators too which had
been so destructive to the osnomian defenses were
only sufficient to bring the outer screen to a dull red
glow after fifteen minutes of passive acceptance of
all the airships could do seaton spoke to the captive

  sir please signal the commanding officer of vessel
seven-two-four that i am going to cut it in two in the
middle have him remove all men in that part of the
ship to the ends and have parachutes in readiness as
i do not wish to cause any loss of life

  the signal was sent and as the officer was already
daunted by the fact that their utmost efforts could not
even make the strangers screens radiate it was obeyed
seaton then threw on the frightful power of the fena-
chrone super-generators the defensive screens of the
doomed warship flashed once-a sparkling corruscating
display of incandescent brilliance-and in the same in-
stant went down simultaneously the entire midsection
of the vessel exploded into light and disappeared com-
pletely volatilized

  sir please signal the entire fleet to cease action and
to follow me down if they do not do so i will destroy
the rest of them

  the skylark dropped to the ground followed by the
fleet of warships who settled in a ring about her-in-
active but ready

  will you please loan me your sending instrument
sir seaton asked from this point on i can carry
on negotiations better direct than through you

  the lieutenant found his voice as he surrendered the
instrument

  sir are you the overlord of osnome of whom
we have heard  we had supposed that one was a mythi-
cal character but you must be he-no one else would
spare lives that he could take and the overlord is the
only being reputed to have a skin the color of yours

  yes lieutenant i am the overlord-and i have
decided to become the overlord of the entire green
system as well as of osnome

  he then sent out a call to the commander-in-chief
of all the armies of the planet informing him that he
was coming to visit him at once and the skylark tore
through the air to the capital city no sooner had the
earthly vessel alighted upon the palace grounds than
she was surrounded by a ring of warships who however
made no offensive move seaton again used the tele-
graph

  commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the
planet urvania greetings from the overlord of this
solar system i invite you to come into my vessel un-
armed and alone for a conference i come in peace
and peace or war as you decide no harm shall come
to you until after you have returned to your own com-
mand think well before you reply

  if i refuse

  i shall destroy one of the vessels surrounding me
and shall continue to destroy them one every ten seconds
until you agree to come if you still do not agree i
shall destroy all the armed forces upon this planet then
destroy all your people who are at present upon osnome
i wish to avoid bloodshed and destruction but i can and
i will do as i have said

  i will come

  the general came out upon the field unarmed escorted
by a company of soldiers a hundred feet from the
vessel he halted the guards and came on alone erect and
soldierly seaton met him at the door and invited him
to be seated

  what can you have to say to me the general de-
manded disregarding the invitation

  many things first let me say that you are not only
a brave man you are a wise general-your visit to me
proves it

  it is a sign of weakness but i believed when i heard
those reports and still believe that a refusal would
have resulted in a heavy loss of our men was the
generals reply

  it would have said seaton i repeat that your
act was not weakness but wisdom the second thing i
have to say is that i had not planned on taking any active
part in the management of things either upon osnome
or upon this planet until i learned of a catastrophe that
is threatening all the civilization in this galaxy-thus
threatening my own distant world as well as those of
this solar system third only by superior force can
i make either your race or the osnomians listen to reason
sufficiently to unite against a common foe you have
been reared in unreasoning hatred for so many genera-
tions that your minds are warped for that reason i
have assumed control of this entire system and shall
give you your choice between co-operating with us or
being rendered incapable of molesting us while our
attention is occupied by this threatened invasion

  we will have no traffic with the enemy whatever
said the general this is final

  you just think so here is a mathematical statement


amazing stories

of what is going to happen to your world unless i
intervene he handed the general a drawing of du-
narks plan and described it in detail that is the
answer of the osnomians to your invasion of their
planet i do not want this world destroyed but if you
refuse to make common cause with us against a common
foe it may be necessary have you forces at your
command sufficient to frustrate this plan

  no but i cannot really believe that sucha deflec-
tion of celestial bodies is possible possible or not you
realize that i could not yield to empty threats

  of course not said seaton but you were wise
enough to refuse to sacrifice a few ships and men in a
useless struggle against my overwhelming armament
therefore you are certainly wise enough to refuse to
sacrifice your entire race however before you come
to any definite conclusion i will show you what threat-
ens the galaxy

tte handed the other a headset and ran through
a the section of the record showing the plans of
the invaders he then ran a few sections showing the
irresistible power at the command of the fenachrone

  that is what awaits us all unless we combine against
them

  what are your requirements  the general asked

  i request immediate withdrawal of all your armed
forces now upon osnome and full co-operation with me
in this coming war against the invaders in return i
will give you the secrets i have just given the osnomians
-the power and the offensive and defensive weapons of
this vessel

  the osnomians are now building vessels such as
this one asked thje general

  they are building vessels a hundred times the size
of this one with the same armament

  for myself i would agree to your terms however
the word of the emperor is law

  i understand replied seaton would you be will-
ing to seek an immediate audience with him i would
suggest that both you and he accompany me and we
shall hold a peace conference with the osnomian
emperor and commander-in-chief upon this vessel we
shall be gone less than a day

   i shall do so at once

  you may accompany your general lieutenant again
i ask pardon for my necessary rudeness

  as the urvanian officers hurried toward the palace
the other terrestrials who had been listening in from
another room entered

  it sounded as though you convinced him dick but
that language is nothing like kondalian why dont
you teach it to us teach it to shiro too so he can
cook for and talk to our distinguished guests intelli-
gently if theyre going back with us

  as he connected up the educator seaton explained
what had happened and concluded

  i want to stop this civil war keep dunark from
destroying this planet preserve osnome for osnomians
and make them all co-operate with us against the fena-
chrone thats one tall order since these folks havent
the remotest notion of anything except killing

  a company of soldiers approached and dorothy got
up hastily

  stick around folks we can all talk to them

   i believe that it would be better for you to be alone
crane decided after a moments thought they are

used to autocratic power and can understand nothing
but one-man control the girls and i will keep out of it

  that might be better at that and seaton went to
the door to welcome the guests seaton instructed them
to lie flat and put on all the acceleration they could
bear it was not long until they were back in kondal
where roban the karfedix and tarnana the karbix
accepted seatons invitation and entered the skylark
unarmed back out in space the vessel stationary sea-
ton introduced the emperors and commanders-in-chief
to each other-introductions which were acknowledged
almost imperceptibly he then gave each a headset
and ran the complete record of the fenachrone brain

  stop shouted roban after only a moment would
you the overlord of osnome reveal such secrets as
this to the ardi-enemies of osnome

  i would i have taken over the overlordship of the
entire green system for the duration of this emergency
and i do not want two of its planets engaged in civil
war

  the record finished seaton tried for some time to
bring the four green warriors to his way of thinking
but in vain roban and tarnan remained contemptuous
they would have thrown themselves upon him but for
the knowledge that no fifty unarmed men of the green
race could have overcome his strength-to them super-
natural the two urvanians were equally obdurate
this soft earth-being had given them everything they
had given him nothing and would give him nothing
finally seaton rose to his full height and stared at them
in turn wrath and determination blazing in his eyes

  i have brought you four together here in a neutral
vessel in neutral space to bring about peace between
you i have shown you the benefits to be derived from
the peaceful pursuit of science knowledge and power
instead of continuing this utter economic waste of con-
tinual war you all close your senses to reason you
of osnome accuse me of being an ingrate and a traitor
you of urvania consider me a soft-headed sentimental
weakling who may safely be disregarded-all because
i think the welfare of the numberless peoples of the
universe more important than your narrow-minded
stubborn selfish vanity think what you please if
brute force is your only logic know now that i can
and will use brute force here are the seven disks
and he placed the bracelet upon robans knee

  if you four leaders are short-sighted enough to place
your petty enmity before the good of all civilization
i am done with you forever i have deliberately given
urvanians precisely the same information that i have
given the osnomians-no more and no less i have given
neither of you all that i know and i shall know much
more than i do now before the time of the conquest shall
have arrived unless you four men here and now
renounce this war and agree to a perpetual peace between
your worlds i shall leave you to your mutual destruc-
tion you do not yet realize the power of the weapons
i have given you when you do realize it you will
know that mutual destruction is inevitable if you con-
tinue this internecine war i shall continue upon other
worlds my search for the one secret standing between
me and a complete mastery of power that i shall find
that secret i am confident and having found it i shall
without your aid destroy the fenachrone

  you have several times remarked with sneers that
you are not to be swayed by empty threats what i
am about to say is no empty threat-it is a most solemn
skylark three



promise given by one who has both the will and the
power to fulfill his every given word now listen care-
fully to this my final utterance if you continue this
warfare and if the victor should not be utterly destroyed
in its course i swear as i stand here by the great first
cause that i shall myself wipe out every trace of the
surviving nation as soon as the fenachrone shall have
been obliterated work with each other and me and
we all may live-fight on and both your nations to the
last person will most certainly die decide now which
it is to be i have spoken

roban took up the bracelet and clasped it again
about seatons arm saying you are more than
ever our overlord you are wiser than are we and
stronger issue your commands and they shall be
obeyed

  why did not you say those things first overlord
asked the urvanian emperor as he saluted and smiled
we could not in honor submit to a weakling no matter
what the fate in store having convinced us of your
strength there can be no disgrace in fighting beneath
your screens an armlet of seven symbols shall be
cast and ready for you when you next visit us roban
of osnome you are my brother

  the two emperors saluted each other and stared eye
to eye for a long moment and seaton knew that the
perpetual peace had been signed then all four spoke
in unison

  overlord we await your commands

  dunark of osnome is already informed as to what
osnome is to do say to him that it will not be neces-
sary for him to build the vessel for me the urvanians
will do that ur van of ur vania you will accompany
roban to osnome where you two will order instant
cessation of hostilities osnome has many ships of this
type and upon some of them you will return your
every soldier and engine of war to your own planet
as soon as possible you will build for me a vessel like
that of the fenachrone except that it shall be ten times
as large in every dimension and except that every in-
strument control and weapon is to be left out

  left out  it shall be so built-but of what use will
it be

   the empty spaces shall be filled after i have returned
from my quest you will build this vessel of dagal
you will also instruct the osnomian commander in the
manufacture of that metal which is so much more resis-
tant than their arenak

  but overlord we have 

  i have just brought immense stores of the precious
chemical and of the metal of power to osnome they
will share it with you i also advise you to build for
yourselves many ships like those of the fenachrone
with which to do battle with the invaders in case i
should fail in my quest you will of course see to it
that there will be a corps of your most efficient mechanics
and artisans within call at all times in case i should
return and have sudden need for them

  all these things shall be done

  the conference ended the four nobles were quickly
landed upon osnome and once more the skylark traveled
out into her element the total vacuum and absolute zero
of the outer void with crane at the controls

  you certainly sounded savage dick i almost
thought you really meant it dorothy chuckled

  i did mean it dot those fellows are mighty keen
on detecting bluffs if i hadnt meant it and if they
hadnt known that i meant it id never have got away
with it

  but you couldnt have meant it dick you wouldnt
have destroyed the osnomians surely-you know you
wouldnt

  no but i would have destroyed what was left of the
urvanians and all five of us knew exactly how it would
have turned out and exactly what i would have done
about it-thats why they all pulled in their horns

  i dont know what would have happened inter-
jected margaret what would have

  with this new stuff the urvanians would have wiped
the osnomians out they are an older race and so
much better in science and mechanics that the osnomians
wouldnt have stood much chance and knew it inci-
dentally thats why im having them build our new
ship theyll put a lot of stuff into it that dunarks
men would miss-maybe some stuff that even the fena-
chrone havent got however though it might seem that
the urvanians had all the best of it urvan knew that
i had something up my sleeve besides my bare arm-and
he knew that id clean up what there was left of his
race if they polished off the osnomians

  what a frightful chance you were taking dick
gasped dorothy

  you have to be hard to handle those folks-and
believe me i was a forty-minute egg right then they
have such a peculiar mental and moral slant that we
can hardly understand them at all this idea of co-
operation is so new to them that it actually dazed all
four of them even to consider it

  do you suppose they will fight anyway asked
crane

  absolutely not both nations have an inflexible code
of honor such as it is and lying is against both codes
thats one thing i like about them-im sort of honest
myself and with either of these races you need nothing
signed or guaranteed

  what next dick

  now the real trouble begins mart oil up the mas-
sive old intellect have you found the answer to the
problem 

  what problem asked dorothy you didnt tell
us anything about a problem

  no i told mart i want the best physicist in this
entire solar system-and since there are only one hundred
and twenty-five planets around these seventeen suns it
should be simple to yon phenomenal brain in fact i
expect to hear him say elementary my dear watson
elementary

  hardly that dick but i have found out a few things
there are some eighty planets which are probably habit-
able for beings like us other things being equal it
seems reasonable to assume that the older the sun the
longer its planets have been habitable and therefore the
older and more intelligent the life 

   ha ha it was elementary says sherlock sea-
ton interrupted youre heading directly at that larg-
est oldest and most intelligent planet then i take it
where i can catch me my physicist

  not directly at it no i am heading for the place
where it will be when we reach it that is elementary
ouch that got to me mart right where i live
ill be good


amazing stories

  but you are getting ahead of me dick-it is not as
simple as you have assumed from what i have said so
far the osnomian astronomers have done wonders in
the short time they have had but their data particularly
on the planets of the outer suns is as yet necessarily
very incomplete since the furthermost outer sun is
probably the oldest it is the one in which we are most
interested it has seven planets four of which are
probably habitable as far as temperature and atmosphere
are concerned however nothing exact is yet known
of their masses motions or places therefore i have
laid our course to intercept the closest one to us as
nearly as i can from what meager data we have if it
should prove to be inhabited by intelligent beings they
can probably give us more exact information concerning
their neighboring planets that is the best i can do
thats a darn fine best old top-narrowing down to
four from a hundred and twenty-five well until we
get there what to do lets sing us a song to keep
our fearless quartette in good voice

  before you do anything said margaret seriously
i would like to know if you really think there is a
chance of defeating those monsters

tn all seriousness i do in fact i am quite con-
fident of it if we had two years i know that we
could lick them cold and by stepping on the gas i
believe we can get the dope in less than the six months
we have to work in

  i know that you are serious dick now you know
that i do not want to discourage any one but i can
see small basis for optimism crane spoke slowly and
thoughtfully i hope that you will be able to control
the zone of force-but you are not studying it yourself
you seem to be certain that somewhere in this system
there is a race who already knows all about it i would
like to know your reasons for thinking that such a race
exists

  they may not be upon this system they may have
been outsiders as we are-but i have reasons for be-
lieving them to be natives of this system since they
were green you are as familiar with osnomian my-
thology as i am-you girls in particular have read
osnomian legends to osnomian children for hours also
identically the same legends prevail upon urvania i
read them in that lieutenants brain-in fact i looked
for them you also know that every folk-legend has
some basis however tenuous in fact now dottie tell
about the battle of the gods when osnome was a pup
the gods came down from the sky dorothy re-
cited they were green as were men they wore
invisible armor of polished metal which appeared and
disappeared they stayed inside the armor and fought
outside it with swords and lances of fire men who
fought against them cut them through and through with
swords and they struck the men with lances of flame
so that they were stunned so the gods fought in
days long gone and vanished in their invisible armor
and-

  thats enough interrupted seaton the little red-
haired girl has her lesson perfectly get it mart
no i cannot say that i do

  why it doesnt even make sense exclaimed mar-
garet

  all right ill elucidate listen and seatons

voice grew tense with earnestness visitors came down
out of space they were green they wore zones of
force which they flashed on and off they stayed in-
side the zones and projected their images outside and
used rays through the zones men who fought against
the images cut them through and through with swords
but could not harm them since they were not actual
substance and the images directed rays against the men
so that they were stunned so the visitors fought in
days long gone and vanished in their zones of force
how does that sound

  you have the most stupendous imagination the world
has ever seen-but there may be some slight basis of
fact there after all said crane slowly

  im convinced of it for one reason in particular
notice that it says specifically that the visitors stunned
the natives now that thought is absolutely foreign
to all osnomian nature--when they strike they kill
and always have now if that myth has come down
through so many generations without having that
stunned changed to killed im willing to bet a few
weeks of time that the rest of it came down fairly
straight too of course what they had may not have
been the zone of force as we know it but it must have
been a ray of some kind-and believe me that was one
educated ray somebody sure had something even way
back in those days and if they had anything at all
back there they must know a lot by now thats why
i want to look em up

  but suppose they want to kill us off at sight ob-
jected dorothy they might be able to do it mightnt
they 

  sure but they probably wouldnt want to-any more
than you would step on an ant who asked you to help
him move a twig thats about how much ahead of
us they probably are of course we struck a pure
mentality once who came darn near dematerializing us
entirely but im betting that these folks havent got
that far along yet by the way ive got a hunch about
those pure intellectuals

  oh tell us about it laughed margaret your
hunches are the worlds greatest brainstorms

  well i pumped out and rejeweled the compass we
put on that funny planet--as a last resort i thought
we might maybe visit them and ask that bozo we had
the argument with to help us out i think he-or it-
would show us everything about the zone of force we
want to know i dont think that wed be dematerialized
either because the situation would give him something
more to think about for another thousand cycles and
thinking seemed to be his main object in life however
to get back to the subject i found that even with the
new power of the compass the entire planet was still out
of reach unless theyve dematerialized it that means
about ten billion light-years as an absolute minimum
think about that for a minute    ive just got a kind
of a hunch that maybe they dont belong in this galaxy
at all-that they might be from some other galaxy
planet and all just riding around on it as we are riding
in the skylark is the idea conceivable to a sane mind
or not

  not decided dorothy promptly wed better go to
bed one more such idea in progression with the last
two youve had would certainly give you a compound
fracture of the skull night cranes

the mystery 
professor brown

                       by a l hodges

                 author of the pea vine mystery and the dead sailor 

      recently we published in amazing stories two very short
      jfv stories by a l hodges-who we might adequately mention
      here is himself a scientist of no mean ability-which were warmly
      received by our readers it was an interesting novelty feature they
      thought which might well be repeated from time to time the
      publication of very short short stories is in an experimental stage
      now and though it is a tremendous task to write a worthwhile short
      tale dealing with scientifiction not often entirely successful we
      know you will enjoy reading this exceedingly interesting bit of scien-
      tific fiction in condensed form

professor yarboro brown was a man in the
prime of life-healthy husky and strong-yet they
found him sprawled out on the floor of his class-
room dead

  dead without a mark on him

  there was no slightest mark on his body and he had
certainly been living ten minutes before the discovery
for he died between the dismissal of one class and the
coming of another

  the professor was one of the really big men in elec-
trical science and his death was so mysterious that its
solution challenged and received the best efforts of the
city and state authorities

  the police investigated his life and found only that
he had served in the war receiving a slight scalp wound
that he had no enemies whatsoever that he was con-
stantly experimenting

  the coroner ordered an autopsy the internal organs
were found in excellent condition there was no poison
in the stomach there was no evidence of heart trouble

  the body was embalmed and interred

  the mystery remained a mystery

  yet dr willie jones assistant to professor brown
decided that he was not through with the case he de-
termined to take it up as a research problem and solve it
he set about interviewing members of the last class in-
structed by the professor and found that he had been
lecturing on and demonstrating a new induction
furnace the new electrical furnace for metals the one
he had was an experimental one he showed the class
how he could hold his hand in this furnace without dis-
comfort provided there were no rings on his fingers but
that if he held a nail in the furnace it soon became red
hot iron and that furnace apparently didnt agree

  jones decided to look over this furnace he found
that it was insecurely fastened to the wall and looking
down saw a screw-driver that had evidently been
dropped on the floor as the furnace was going when
the body was found jones was satisfied that it was con-
nected in some way with the death of the professor he
therefore picked up the screw-driver and started to
tighten the screw that was loose which was outside the
furnace

  he found that the most convenient position for him
to assume in tightening this screw placed the top of his
head in the mouth of the furnace itself and here he
was more mystified than ever this should not cause
any discomfort much less death

  so temporarily jones gave up trying to solve the
mystery of the death of prof brown

  when however he saw the police report he thought
over the matter harder than ever and finally arrived at
an astounding conclusion he went to see the coroner
stated that he was absolutely certain that the old scalp
wound suffered by the professor during the war had con-
tained a fragment of metal that this metal had become
red hot when the professor poked his head into the
induction furnace and had killed his chief

  after some persuasion the coroner agreed to disinter
the body and take an x-ray of the head this was done
and disclosed that jones was correct and that the frag-
ment of iron had burned a clean hole from just under
the top of the skull down through the brain as its weight
caused it to sink down into the hole which it had burned
for itself

  professor brown had forgotten that the surgeon
had told him there might still be a small fragment of
iron left in his skull

so these were the mighty steel monsters which hauled

peculiarly opportune at this
mt time is a story dealing with the
antarctic polar regions admiral byrd
having established himself at the south
pole has brought these erstwhile unknown
regions considerably within the scope of our
knowledge but aside from the interest
which we now have in the south polar
regions our new author deals with an-
other exceedingly ingenious idea revolving
around the subject of beryllium this ele-
ment is a metallic base of the emerald and
bids fair to enter into industry on a large
scale as a metal of valuable qualities mr
van dresser knows his subject there is no
doubt about that and what is equally im-

this is one of the best short stories of scien-

south polar

 crylllufyl limited

 official plane number three of south
 polar beryllium ltd droned its way south-
 ward through the cold thin air a thousand
 feet above the great antarctic plateau its
 four thordarson oil turbines driving it
 through the rare atmosphere at an easy two hundred and
 ninety miles an hour roared a song of power which pene-
 trated the insulated walls of the passenger cabin and
 murmured subdued harmonies in its warm comfortable
 interior hunched comfortably in his wicker seat
 wallace de vries hamilton assistant chemist of the
 great s p b ltd looked out of his window at the
 jagged white desolation below and shivered it was a
 country hostile to mankind-a country of vast snow
 deserts seamed by treacherous crevasses of high solitary
 plateaus swept by terrific windstorms of gaunt mountain
 ranges whose rocky flanks jutted up through the mo-
 notonous mantle of white during four weary months of
 t each year it was a land of deadly cold and darkness when
 the aurora australis flickered and wove eerie shifting
 patterns of greenish light in the chill sky

    hamilton thought of the early antarctic explorations
  which preceded and made possible mans present fa-
  miliarity with the south polar regions over a century
  ago-before the middle of the nineteenth century-ex-
  plorers had headed their sailing craft southward to the
  bottom of the world in a serious attempt to penetrate
  the great ice barrier which everywhere guarded the
  antarctic coast line their ships were often crushed in
  the relentless grasp of the ice or overwhelmed in terrific
  gales  they were forced to endure sometimes years of
  imprisonment and solitude before they could fight their
  way northward again yet little by little such men as
  cook ross durville and wilkes added to our store
  of knowledge concerning at least the outer limits of
  these unknown regions

    but it was not until the twentieth century that inland
  expeditions of any length were made then scott dry-
  galski shackleton bruce and others penetrated some-
  what into the interior locating the coast line of victoria
  quadrant west of the ross sea of kaiser wilhelm sec-
  ond land in the enderby quadrant and of coates land
  and west antarctica that desolate archipelago thrusting
  out towards cape horn in the weddel sea

    it seemed incredible that man should carry on for no
  tangible reward under such difficult conditions as beset
  these early explorers all progress was made only by
  the most dogged and continuous physical effort-weary
  weeks and months of trekking on snow shoes or on skis

sufficient food could be carried only by the most careful
planning and when unexpected setbacks occurred suf-
fering and privation inevitably followed and always
there was the bitter cold waiting to cripple by frostbite
or kill outright

  the climax of this era of exploration was reached
when amundsen in a carefully planned and perfectly
executed expedition reached the pole on december six-
teenth  and returned safely almost a month later
scott attained the same goal only to meet bitter disap-
pointment in the discovery of amundsens cairn and
grim death on the return trail

  it was not until the nineteen-twenties that man had
sufficiently perfected his new tools the radio and the air-
plane to enable him to employ them successfully in re-
mote parts of the world hamilton remembered the
names of byrd the careful organizer and scientific ex-
plorer and wilkins the brilliant free lance as pioneers
of aeronautical polar expeditions since that time with
the improvement of equipment antarctic exploration had
been carried farther and farther till by nineteen-forty
the whole continent was fairly well mapped

  for ten years then interest had been dormant during
the period of exploration the continent had been par-
celled tentatively out among several nations notably
england the united states norway and germany in-
terest had been rather keen in this division and several
disputes had arisen over boundaries and conflicting
claims but as the years rolled by this interest waned for
no rich deposits of coal mica or petroleum as had been
expected were discovered in  by mutual consent
of the interested nations administration of the antarctic
regions had been transferred to an unimportant bureau
of the league of nations the principal questions
which arose concerning these regions were those relating
to maritime and aeronautical law and hence were of in-
ternational concern

  thus antarctica remained a desolate waste crossed
by a few dirigible lines and now and then by scientific
expeditions in planes or motor sleds for the purpose of
making geological meteorological or magnetic observa-
tions

  and then in  frobisher-sydney frobisher the
picturesque reckless hard-bitten adventurer and scien-
tific pioneer-had come up from this forgotten bottom of
the world with startling news

  in the barren uplands three hundred miles southwest of
king edward vii land he had discovered phenomen-
ally rich veins of aluminum and beryllium metasilicate




amazing stories

  hamilton remembered the excitement that prevailed
when the information leaked out twenty-two years
earlier the refinement of beryllium ores had become com-
mercially practicable and alloys of the metal were
rapidly introduced into airplane and airship construction
fairly large deposits near nerchinsk in siberia had
proved the best source of supply hitherto but frobish-
ers discovery revealed vast possibilities and that versa-
tile man as soon as he arrived in australia had devoted
his great energy and powerful personality to organizing
a company for the development of these possibilities

  hamilton remembered well the aura of romantic ad-
venture which had invested frobishers name in this
age when romance and adventure were seemingly dead
and the world a well-charted and easily traversed globe
in  he had set out alone from little america in a
light alfure tractor-sled equipped with a molecular
resonance ore finder and analyzer the antarctic had
swallowed him up and the public read of another crazy
prospector risking his life futilely hamilton could im-
agine him guiding his machine over terrain like that
below-picking his way around dangerous crevasses
breasting furious blizzards making his little camp at
night crouched over his butylene stove he reappeared
in three months-said little laid in provisions and disap-
peared again for two years frobisher maintained this
schedule-until one day he returned to make his amazing
announcement not to the public at first-not until
south polar beryllium ltd of melbourne was organized
and had gained control of the richest of the deposits

  hamilton young and impressionable at the time had
been thrilled at the wonderful display of the powers of
the modern engineering and economic systems little
america the tiny settlement and expedition base on
the east shore of the ross sea had rapidly grown into a
thriving port with facilities for handling and trans-ship-
ping the ore new sidney a unique semi-underground
city had been created at the mine head-transport prob-
lems had been met and solved with amazing ingenuity

  and by the time hamilton graduated with honors from
colorado school of mines the pioneering had all been
done-another ore field had been discovered and the
international metallurgical corporation of berne had
seized that for development

now all this was commonplace-and hamilton was
only an unusually young assistant corporation
chemist making a quick trip to the mine life was a
trifle monotonous nowadays if only one of the big
thordarson turbines would fail and bring them limping
into port or if a terrible polar blizzard would shriek
out of the southwest and resist furiously every inch of
their progress but no those oil turbines could roar at
top speed for seven hundred hours and never miss a
power cycle while as for storms the meteorological
service warned of them long in advance and they howled
out their furies through empty skies

  or what if bandits should attack the plane after all
big interests were involved in this trip if international
met had somehow gotten wind of the new refining
method and had put secret agents on his trail pshaw
he was imagining an old-fashioned melodrama with
secret interests and sabotage and all the rest of it ex-
citing if true-but after all the scenery below was
mighty inhospitable and it was pleasanter to think about
adventure here than to undergo it

  a glance at his watch showed the plane an hour and
a quarter out from little america in fifteen or twenty
minutes more they were due at new sidney no sign
of civilization yet-only the jagged crevassed expanse of
mary byrd land slipped by below he wondered how
they would fare if the radio beacon down whose in-
groove they were heading should suddenly cease as-
tronomical navigation in these parts was extraordinarily
difficult and the magnetic compass very unreliable

  suddenly his attention was focussed on a tiny black
dot on the snow field far below and to the right the
pilot evidently had seen it too for the plane swerved
a trifle and began a long sweeping glide the dot grew
larger and larger grew into a beetle-a monstrous black
beetle crawling over the white surface it dawned on
hamilton that this formidable bug was one of the huge
freight tractors operating between little america and
new sidney now he could see the famous arlington
tractor route the hard packed lane winding its way
back north and west one hundred miles through tortuous
rhyker pass in the charles bob mountains here in
a series of hairpin loops and turns it dropped seven
thousand feet to the level of ross barrier whence it
turned almost north and drove towards little america
over the comparatively level surface

  they were now only a few hundred feet above the
tractor hamilton could see and appreciate its vast bulk
fully eighty feet long and fifteen feet high-it relent-
lessly clanked its way forward like some ponderous pre-
historic monster its great driving wheels revolved
majestically carrying their caterpillar treads whose six
foot plates crunched and bit into the packed snow sur-
face with irresistible force the whole atmosphere in
the region of this vast machine trembled with the exhaust
roar of its turbines the earth quaked under its giants
tread hamilton noticed the row of steel hatches down
its back where the ore from the mines was loaded in
and another row along one side from which the ore
poured out at the discharging station in little america
up at the bow was a small deck-house terminating in
a glass enclosed control room as the plane swooped
down a window opened and an arm reached out to wave
a greeting the pilot acknowledged it and the turbines
of the airplane resumed their hum upward they swept
in a long climb which soon reduced the great tractor to
the size of an insignificant crawling ant so these were
the mighty steel monsters which hauled the produce of
new sidney to the outer world

  the atmosphere which had so far been clear and
sparkling was becoming slightly hazy the snow-
covered land below grew rapidly indistinct in a fog
through which the sun gleamed with a dull white pallor
yet the pilot seemed not at all dismayed by the lack of
visibility his echo altimeter gave him his exact height
above ground while the radio beacon held him rigidly
to the course in fact the automatic helmsman with
which these planes were equipped frequently took charge
for the whole trip hamilton noted with relief that they
were now under automatic control for with the coming
of the fog the pilot had thrown in the iron mike and
was leaning back in his seat gazing out of the window

  suddenly a tiny green light glowed on the instrument
board the pilot opened a little window into the passen-
ger compartment and called back to hamilton-weve
picked up the high frequency sound beacon from the
field our receptor is holding us right in the center
south polar beryllium limited



of the beam which slants down to the field at the right
gliding angle

  as he spoke the roar of the propellers died away to
a purr

  it even throttles the motors at the proper altitude-
lord in calm weather like this the pilot might as well
curl up and go to sleep after the take-off theres noth-
ing else he has to do

  two parallel red glowing tracks appeared in the fog
below them-the neon landing guides laid even with or a
little below the surface of the flying field the plane
settled lightly between them rolled a hundred yards and
came to a stop

the mine

the surface of the flying field stretched away
dimly into the mist at its edges could be seen
the vague bulk of low snow-covered buildings
the pilot pointed ahead to one of them the hangars
-well taxi inside and unload there-we never do any-
thing outside here if we can help it too cold

  as they approached the building a low wide door-
way opened and the plane slid smoothly into the lighted
and warmed interior they came to rest in line with a
dozen planes of similar type-light mail and passenger
carriers hamilton climbed out of the cabin grip in
hand the baggage compartment had already been
opened and attendants were hurling mail sacks into a
little electric truck

  he stood irresolute for a moment till he spied a stocky
red-faced little man hurrying towards him

  youre hamilton the new assistant chemist im
pat mcintyre general super here mighty glad to see
you mr hamilton-ive heard a good deal about you
from headquarters come along and ill show you
your rooms i guess youd like to wash up a bit

  the little man talking volubly led the way we
havent much above ground here-just these hangars
with official quarters and offices at the north end of them
and a few miscellaneous buildings ventilating stacks
freight elevator outlets and so on theres not much ad-
vantage in outside exposure here-the view is sort of
monotonous even if it happens to be a clear day and
its too hard to keep the buildings warm and clear of
snow well here we are

  they had passed through several concrete floored pas-
sageways and entered a small bedroom with a window
opening on the flying field

  my room is right around the corner-in fact most of
the officers live on this floor the mess hall lounge
and so on are on the ground floor also the offices-
what there are of them mine the field metallurgists
the transportation engineers the chief mining engineers
and a few others a fancy lot of titles but theyre a
good bunch come on down as soon as youre ready
hamilton examined his room it was of concrete with
a tiled floor-all fireproof construction the outer wall
where the window embrasure pierced it was at least
two and a half feet thick made of reinforced concrete
and double thickness of hollow tile for insulation the
window itself was of triple glass permanently set in
near the floor he noticed a small grated opening a
current of pleasantly warmed air was flowing into the
room the building seemed admirably constructed to
withstand the rigors of the antarctic climate presently

he became aware of a dull murmur and pulsation which
drifted up the ventilating duct and permeated the at-
mosphere like the throb of engines which is always
present on shipboard it was the voice of the mine
the mingled vibrations of all the great machines inces-
santly at work in the depths below all this was new
and intensely interesting to the young chemist he had
worked so far only at the refining plant in melbourne
and had no opportunity to visit new sidney he an-
ticipated with pleasure his trip through the mine with
mcintyre it would certainly be unique like no mine
he had ever seen before

  a sudden roar from outside which penetrated the
triple glass windows attracted his attention a great
door had opened in one of the distant buildings nosing
its way outward like a gigantic blind mammoth was one
of the freight tractors of the sort they had passed in the
plain he watched while its skipper jockeyed it through
the portal with great roaring spurts of its port or star-
board turbine at last it was outside the door slid
shut and the vast machine lumbered off westward
through the mist for its three-hundred-mile trek to little
america

  mcintyre was busy looking over some reports as
hamilton entered his office have a seat he said
there wont be time to look over the works before
lunch so i thought we could pass the hour profitably in
conversation he hitched his chair to a more com-
fortable angle and drew out a smoke-blackened brier
pipe

  i understand from a letter which i received yesterday
from the chief that you are down here on fairly im-
portant business naturally i am mighty curious to
hear what you have to say-though to be frank i think i
have a good idea of what youll talk about tell me
now-you have some plan for cutting down on the
weight of our ore shipment to little america-isnt that
it

  right you are assented hamilton but i dont see
how you knew it thats all supposed to be a deep
secret

  nothing to it if youd been in this outfit as long as
i have and gone to every blessed yearly board meeting
where old frobisher invariably comes down like a ton
of brick on saunders hes our transportation man here
because his bloomin little tractors run up too big an ex-
pense account-youd know what the old man is worry-
ing about i know its the overland haul that eats into
our profits the worst of it is that seventy-five percent
of the cargo is worthless-slags out in the furnaces at
melbourne

  i know thats the problem earl strauber was work-
ing on the old man put a lot of store by him-and i
happen to know that he was pretty hard hit when strau-
ber went bad and had to be fired for misappropriation
of funds naturally frobisher looked for a man to con-
tinue the work and picked you for your success with
pyrargyrite ores at the gila mines and by the look
in your eye id say that maybe youve figured this thing
out am i right

  thats about it laughed hamilton you seem to be
quite a sherlock holmes i never knew that there was
any scandal connected with straubers disappearance

  oh sure-he was a bad egg-i never liked him-met
him a couple of times when he came down to look the
mine over they do say he was a dam good metallurgist

lord you never can tell what a man will do he fell
silent puffing at his stubby pipe

  hamilton was unbuckling the straps of his brief case
he took out a package of typed pages and blueprints
and tossed it on the desk

  mcintyre-thats a batch of papers that is going to
cause you some sleepless nights during the next year or
so they are the tentative plans for the installation here
of an experimental forced-field ionic separator for the
reduction of beryllium and aluminium metasilicates to
beryllium oxide

  the superintendent looked keenly at hamilton the
name of that apparatus is mighty impressive but its
strange to me if it can do that little trick in a way that
we can manage here-i begin to understand what fro-
bisher meant when he said you were coming here on
important business

  exactly there is no necessity for enlarging on the
value of this method of refining with it we can by
purely chemical and electrical apparatus produce fairly
pure beryllium oxide at the mine head no heat or fuel
is required the apparatus uses only water as a solvent
and electric current to set up certain fields of force ill
give you a brief idea of how the thing works its my
own brain-child and naturally im rather proud of it

  of course the metasilicate is normally insoluble to
make use of any of the ordinary chemical operations
which are not accompanied by combustion or similar
violent reactions it is necessary to have the reacting
materials in solution and in an ionized state accord-
ingly i have worked on the problem of forcing solution
and ionization in normally insoluble substances tak-
ing my cue from the known effect of ultra-violet light and
the various other ionizing agents and also working with
alternating high-frequency electrostatic fields i suc-
ceeded in developing a projector which in conjunction
with a field of proper frequency and intensity would
first shatter the suspended crystals of the ore into their
component molecules and would then break up those
molecules into their component ions bear with me
macintyre

  having dissolved and ionized the compound it is then
necessary to differentiate between the ions as it were
pick out the ions which we want to combine again into
new compounds remove them from the ionizing field
and then allow them to unite by proper placing of the
electrodes it is possible to separate the positive and
negative ions and by an application of the principle of
the molecular resonance apparatus used in ore prospect-
ing i shield each electrode from all ions but those of
a certain mass he smiled at macintyres look of patient
resignation

  what all this boils down to can be expressed in this
equation he took up a piece of paper and wrote

albesi-fh beo alohs t
hsios

  in ordinary chemistry that is an impossible equation
it just wouldnt work but by the proper application
of force i can make it work the products separate
out at different electrodes and have no opportunity to
recombine except as we choose so we have nothing but
beryllium oxide to ship-a fraction of the weight you
carry at present-to say nothing of the simplification of
the refining process

  i have worked out the practical application of this

method with hardman at the melbourne plant we
have been successfully operating one of the units for six
weeks now hardman has also made a series of tenta-
tive plans for the installation of the apparatus here
these i have brought down

  obviously the new unit must be operated as part of
the ore-dressing department as it requires finely di-
vided material for proper operation we decided to use
the discharge from your concentrating tables which is
the metasilicate pretty well purified and granulated of
course if the process entirely supplants the fused-ore
electrolytic works at melbourne well run all the ore
through the grinders and pulverizers then through the
hydraulic separators and concentrators so as to get a
uniform product and i guess thats about the whole
story-except that i want you to check over these plans
and routing schedules in them ive given you all the
dope about the dimensions the hourly capacity of the
machine and the necessary hydraulic and electric con-
nections everything is there but the insides which
were keeping as a company secret its rather risky
but we hope to keep our advantage over international
met longer than the few years of patent protection
well said macintyre as he rose and knocked the
ashes out of his pipe i can see where im in for a
stretch of hard work whipping a brand-new process into
shape to meet practical conditions gosh when i
think of some of the sessions with dumb shop foremen-
not to mention annual third degrees in front of dumber
boards of directors-but itll be worth it lets be
getting to lunch afterwards i guess youd like to take
a look around he placed the plans in a drawer of
his desk and locked it

a subterranean industry

the mess hall was a spacious airy room well
lit by large triple glass windows and colite tubes
set in the ceiling hamilton enjoyed the meal
many of the men were old timers who had tales to tell of
the founding of new sidney of the difficulties and
hazards that the pioneers underwent he heard descrip-
tions of forced landings hundreds of miles from civili-
zation of lost motor-sleds wandering for days in un-
explored canyons and mountain passes grisly tales of
frozen corpses and unsolved mysteries those must
have been the days

  after lunch macintyre announced that he could
spare the afternoon and was ready to accompany ham-
ilton on a tour of inspection first he said i think
you ought to see our power plant its the heart of
the whole establishment of course and its not deep as
we btiilt it right at the start

  they went down a concrete stairway to the first level
which was just beneath the surface after traversing
a few colite-illuminated corridors they entered the
dynamo room-long and low with rows of squat direct-
coupled tesla turbines and alternators the walls were
paneled with switchboards and meters which fluctuated
slightly with the varying loads on the innumerable mine
motors a few attendants were present otherwise the
only indications of the tremendous force generated in
this room was the high pitched whine of the turbine discs
spinning at terrific speed

  these are operating at fifteen hundred pounds pres-
sure and i forgot what temperature macintyre in-
south polar beryllium limited



formed hamilton but its so high that the blades have
to be made of aranium we have to give credit to you
metallurgists for developing alloys like that

  as to our power source-i suppose you know that
we have here one of the seven existing starbuck thermo-
borings  a six-mile shaft tapping the earths internal
heat these are practicable only in very rare circum-
stances when the cost of fuel is absolutely prohibitive
id hate to figure out how much this boring cost us
we sank it with a modified starbuck teredo powered
by short range radio beam we disliked using such an
inefficient method of power transmission but five or
six miles of power cable hanging straight down is quite
a load youll see some of our big teredos at work later
on

  they crossed the dynamo room and entered a concrete
chamber beyond the great steam manifold from the
turbines led into this room and passed through a formid-
able series of regulating valves to the head of an eighteen-
inch pipe this was the main which drove six miles
down into the earth to tap its limitless sources of heat
and energy macintyre pointed out the smaller pipe
which passed down within the steam line and supplied
the water to be vaporized by the high temperature all
the piping was heavily heat insulated yet the chamber
was exceedingly hot and it seemed to hamilton as if
the air was quivering from the terrific tension of the
confined steam he felt as if they were standing over
an immense boiler which might blow up at any moment
it was great relief to leave the valve chamber

  we use the exhaust from the turbines to heat all our
buildings said the superintendent of course the lower
levels of the mine need no heating the surface tempera-
ture has no effect down there

  adjoining the dynamo room was the fan room here
great rotary blowers drew air in from forty-foot stacks
above ground warmed it over coils heated by exhaust
steam and sent it through ducts to all parts of the mine
and buildings

  next they visited the residential section of the little
subterranean town the main street of which was an
especially wide corridor flanked by dormitories recrea-
tion halls a general store a television and movie theater
eating halls-in fact all of the necessaries and many of
the luxuries of life everywhere the colite tubes shed
their radiance a pleasant illumination which closely ap-
proximated sunlight the air was kept fresh and mild
by the ventilating system

  on the other side of town was the factory district
here were extensiye mechanical and electrical shops for
the maintenance of mine machinery of the ore tractors
and of the company planes here also was the ore-
dressing department-a series of great halls filled with
massive pulverizing machines sizing machines hydraulic
and centrifugal classifiers and concentrating tables-
all of the apparatus for preparing the ore for the actual
refining the ore was received at one end of this series
of machines as a mixture of beryl and granite pegmatites
-the latter chiefly quartz and feldspar and after
traversing it emerged as fairly pure aluminum beryllium
metasilicate ready to be shipped the ore dressing de-
partment was an inferno of noise but even here the
air was quite pure as all the machines which handled
the ore dry were enclosed completely and their fines
or rock dust were removed pneumatically

  the final product was conveyed to loading hoppers

in an adjoining department under these the freight
tractors received their cargoes which they carried up
a ramp to the great doorway hamilton had seen from
his window besides the tractors there were a num-
ber of cargo sledges to be towed by the more powerful
machines

  well have to excavate rooms here somewhere for
the new machines macintyre shouted into his com-
panions ear against the roar and rumble of falling ore

  yes-hardman figured you could make it by digging
into the south end of the hall the metallurgist roared
back lets get out of here and go down into the
workings

  they followed the great endless chain ore-conveyors
to the head of the main shaft and were dropped five
hundred feet in the cage with qualmish speed the
shaft was double and provided for the operation of a
cage an ore hoist and for the great main ventilating
duct hydraulic mains and electric power cables

  they stopped opposite a deep shelf cut into the shaft
wall the six-foot mouth of a circular concrete lined
tunnel yawned opposite them several large power
cables a branch from the hydraulic main and one from
the ventilating duct vanished into it a flexible tube
about eighteen inches in diameter also led out of the
tunnel and ended in an ore hopper from its mouth at
rhythmic intervals a slushy mass of ore and water
poured into the hopper this hamilton recognized as
the ingenious peristaltic conveyor a device for con-
veying semi-liquid materials by the same alternate con-
traction and expansion of its wails that carries food
through the aesophagus and intestine of the animal
system it was built of a series of sliding rings operated
by powerful solenoids current impulses were supplied
to these solenoids in the proper order to produce the
peristaltic motion by a simple commutator which cor-
responded to a ganglion of the nervous system the
whole tube was enclosed in a heavy flexible coating for
protection altogether it was a very ingenious solution
of the problem of transportation of crushed material
as it could easily be laid around corners and through
constricted areas

  the two men picked their way along the tunnel towards
its head at first the gurgling and scraping of ore were
audible in the conveyor but as they advanced it was
drowned out by an ear-splitting grinding roar from
ahead at last they reached the tunnel-head and the
source of the racket-a teredo tunneler here was
another machine for which nature had furnished the in-
spiration like the little mollusc its namesake it bored
its way slowly forward and as it progressed lined its
burrow with a strong quick-setting concrete

  for b while they stood at the rear watching the slow
irresistible progress of the mass of mechanism a con-
tinuous stream of ground ore spouted from an opening
in its back was mixed with water and dropped into the
maw of the peristaltic conveyor extra lengths of the
tubing were stacked to one side coils of electric cable
were under foot and puddles from the leaking water
joints gleamed in the dim tunnel lighting

  they entered the rear operating compartment which
was like the inside of an early submarine here an
engineer was regulating the apparatus which mixed the
concrete and which exuded it in viscous stream from
openings around the rear of the machine farther for-
ward were the controls for the driving mechanism-the


amazing stories

 powerful motors which rotated the outer shell with its
 screw threads of lambda-tungsten carbide the whole
 front was filled by the motors that drove the synthetic-
 diamond tipped cutters which ground their way steadily
 into the rock ahead they vibrated like an electric mas-
 sagist and the grinding roar from the cutters made even
 thinking much less talking almost impossible after
 a few minutes hamilton could stand it no longer and
 retreated back along the tunnel macintyre followed
 mopping his brow

   the men who operate those devilish machines are
 the highest paid mechanics we have they sure deserve
 what they get

   i can understand where all the power from those
 turbines goes said hamilton as they walked back to
 the shaft those contraptions must use a terrific
 amount

    yes one teredo requires about three thousand horse
  power we couldnt build motors to deliver that power
  and still take up so little room if we didnt use super-
  malloy for the armatures and field cores its also used
  in the solenoids of the peristaltics

   by the time they reached the mine head and made
 their way back to macintyres office it was time for
 the evening meal the mist outside was almost as light
 as when hamilton arrived for it was december and
 the sun was not yet dipping below the horizon

    after supper hamilton talked further with the super-
  intendent concerning the new plans macintyre prom-
  ised to send them back to melbourne in a weeks time
  with whatever modifications he or his staff found neces-
  sary the chemist turned in early as he planned to take
  the mail plane that left for little america at five-thirty
   in the morning

 on the morning of the day after he left new sidney
 hamilton arrived in melbourne he had had a
 three-hour wait in little america between connections
 which he had spent in seeing the sights of this unusual
 port it was then at the height of its season of activity
 the pack had broken and the powerful ice-breaking ore
 vessels were plowing their way into the bay of whales
 to pick up their cargoes of ore and buffet their way
 northward the great stores of ore which the freight
 tractors had been piling up during the months when
 the port had been icebound were diminishing the town
 was perpetually noisy with the clatter of ore loaders
 poking their steel snouts into the holds of the dock
 vessels with the clank and roar of incoming tractors
 and the more musical tones of the motors of arriving
 or departing freight dirigibles and passenger liners

    at thirteen oclock the melbourne de luxe flyer took
  off with hamilton on board he passed the monotonous
  hours of daylight over the grey south pacific reading
  and working on ideas for the new ionic separator his
  favorite brain-child towards dusk the weather became
  a bit too heavy for writing he switched off his reading
  light and gazed out of the cabin porthole into darkening
  cloud wracks scudding by far below gleamed the
  lights of a vessel-probably one of the s p b ore
  fleet

   at twenty-two oclock after a light supper and a
 glance at the television news service he went to bed
 the air was rather bumpy and the big plane rode un-
 easily so he snapped the safety belt across his narrow
 berth before he dropped off to sleep

  some time later he was aroused by the cessation of
the motor hum and vibration water was lapping
against the hull and outside the dark porthole lights
were flashing and voices murmuring this was the
stop-over in ivercargill at the southern tip of new zea-
land for refueling and motor checking he knew it
would not be long before daybreak but they were not
due to arrive before mid-morning so he turned over and
went to sleep again while the great plane winged its
way steadily westward across the new zealand sea

preparations

hamilton spent over a month after his return
from new sidney in making ready the commer-
cial unit of his ionic separator for transportation
and insulation at the mine the difficulties were increased
greatly by the necessity for secrecy he and the en-
gineer hardman were forced to arrange for the con-
struction of vital parts at different electrical shops and
together they assembled them at the same time they
kept in communication with macintyre who had checked
over the installation plans and was proceeding with the
necessary enlargements and construction of auxiliary
apparatus as the winter was approaching and it would
soon be impossible to get in by ship to little america
hamilton speeded up his preparations as much as
possible

  by february sixth thanks to an extra appropriation
made by the board of directors the first industrial
size ionic separator was completed and had been stowed
in the freight hold of the vulcan one of the fastest
and newest ore carriers

  and early next morning the powerful craft dropped
her pilot off point nepean and turned her armoured
prow stubbornly into the great grey seas of the roaring
forties for four days the vulcan in ballast wobbled
and butted her way southward and eastward hamil-
ton spent most of this time with the ships officers on
the enclosed main bridge in the officers mess sometimes
up on the open flying bridge with the wind and spray
splashing against his oilskins or down in the engine
room where the immense oil turbines roared in captivity
he enjoyed the trip immensely in spite of the fact that
he had to hang on to something whenever he wanted to
remain upright repeatedly he was rolled out of his berth
and for one horrible morning was helpless in the grip
of mal de tner these tough ore carriers were not
equipped with any such luxuries as gyroscopic stabilizers

  she drove relentlessly on at her moderate thirty knots
and on the fifth day the wind having blown itself out
they entered the realm of floating ice here speed was
reduced to twelve knots extra lookouts were posted
and an officer was always on duty at the iceberg indi-
cator this instrument was essentially an exceedingly
delicate horizontally acting balance which responded
to the attraction of any mass great enough to be dan-
gerous within a range of several miles of course the
vulcan was an ice-breaker and with her tough alloy
steel ribs and plating could stand a lot of beating yet
to ram any of the huge flat-topped icebergs which
sometimes appeared in these waters would have been
injudicious to say the least

  after twenty hours of this cautious progress they
came within sight of the magnificent rugged sea-face
of ross barrier in another hour they were entering
south polar beryllium limited



the bay of whales to the sound of splitting ice slabs
shattered by the vulcans sharp prow the snow-laden
buildings of little america came into view clustered
at the edge of the white shore line by the waters edge
were the docks cut into the barrier itself each with its
black ore-handling machinery beside it farther inland
could be seen the dirigible mooring mast with a cluster
of hangars near by a ship lay in one of the basins
the roar of her loading with ore accompanied the shout-
ing of orders and the clatter of winches as the vulcan
docked

over the tractor trail

the freight tractor boanergesy having delivered
her ore had been ordered to stand by to receive the
vulcans consignment of machinery hamilton
watched with interest the transfer of his crated and
canvas-covered separator from the hold of the sea-going
vessel to that of the land vessel a powerful electric
crane dropped a cable down into the vulcan where slings
had been rigged silently and smoothly the heavy
mass of delicate machinery rose swung in an arc and
was swallowed without a jar by the open number one
hatch of the boanerges her skipper a likable and
efficient young man stood by supervising the stowage
nder his orders the job was done in an hour

  he explained to hamilton i am anxious to start
as soon as possible we have been having unnaturally
good weather and i want to be well on my way before
it cracks if we can get through the pass before then
ill be satisfied

  hamilton accepted the hint and soon climbed the little
steel ladder leading to the topsides of the boanerges

  the greater part of the flat deck was taken up by
a row of five steel loading hatches forward was a
low deckhouse terminating in a rounded glass control
room a small sturdy door opened on either side to the
interior he entered to deposit his suitcase and found
himself in a narrow longitudinal corridor forward it
opened into the control room-aft was a steel stairway
leading down-presumably to the engine room two
small rooms flanking the entrance way opened off the
port side-the galley and washroom on the starboard
was one larger compartment doubtless the officers
saloon thought hamilton as it boasted leather uphol-
stered benches against the wall heavy glass ports il-
luminated all the rooms except the control room which
was provided with wide vision windows the whole
thing was an odd combination of the atmospheres of
land and sea travel-
sounds of activity were drifting up from the engine
room-the clinking of metal and murmuring of voices
a muffled throbbing of pumps resounded through the
cabins then a loud stuttering hiss-the air starters
were spinning the turbines a few preliminary coughs
and spurts and the boanerges vibrated gently with the
deep rumbling exhaust of her idling engines outside
the closing of the hatches was about completed the
skipper came running nimbly up the side followed by
another young man in the company uniform

    mr hamilton meet mr fellows our radio operator
and electrical man if you have any questions hell be
glad to answer em-youll excuse me for a while-
i have to take charge now

  he entered the control room and sat down in the

pilots seat before him were the throttle and reversing
levers for the port and starboard turbines the clutch
control and the revolving pointer of the ratio control
which varied uniformly the number of revolutions which
the turbines made to each revolution of the drive wheels
at the minimum setting or high with open throttle
the boanerges could make about nineteen miles an
hour on the level at the maximum setting her tractive
effort was terrific the use of turbines in this field
was made possible by the famous voight transmission
which provided positive mechanical connection between
engine and drive wheel and at the same time allowed
the drive ratio to be uniformly varied

  he spoke into the engine room telephone are you
ready below mr frazer

  aye aye came back the answer

  with the ratio control at maximum the skipper opened
the throttles and slowly let in the clutch hamilton
heard the increased roar of motors felt the first lurch
of the floor he looked out a window-a few muffled-
up bystanders were watching them-they passed out of
range as the boanerges heaved forward the ratio
was decreased the throttle was opened a trifle more
and they lumbered with increasing speed up the packed
trail which led back from the little settlement

  well have to stop at the roundhouse to pick up an
empty trailer fellows raised his voice against the
drumming of the exhaust and the clanking of the treads

  the roundhouse and shops for the tractors lay about
half a mile back from the town around them was a
great area of snow packed and churned with grease
from the continual maneuvering of the machines their
trailer was ready for them hamilton watched the skip-
per as he skilfully backed into it so that the automatic
couplings clicked with no help from the ground crew

  once again they started-this time with the empty
trailer lurching after on its six-foot runners as he
gazed ahead at the trail vanishing into the distance across
the barren snow-covered barrier hamilton felt a thrill
which the others hardened antarctic travelers seemed
not to notice the sky was heavy with rolling grey
clouds a few snowflakes drifted down he walked
to the rear porthole and looked out the last buildings
of little america were out of sight the boanerges had
become a tiny center of human achievement in the midst
of a vast dcadness of nature

  hamilton went down the steel stairway to the crowded
noisy engine room he quickly made the acquaintance
of the chief engineer mr frazer and his assistant who
were glad to show and explain the mechanism the low
steel-arched room was divided in the center by a runway
with handrails on each side were the long cylindrical
main turbines terminating in massive clutch-cases and
voight transmission housings from which the drive
shafts led to the rear worm-gears there was no
monotonous beat as in the engine room of a ship for
the speed of the turbines was always varying in obedience
to the throttle as the skipper worked the huge machine
over bad spots in the trail or around crevasses and ob-
stacles in the route when hamilton commented on
this to frazer the old engineer told him to come down
while they were negotiating the pass if he wanted to see
the skipper playing the anvil chorus on the turbines and
voights itll fairly shake the teeth out of your head
to stand on that runway then-that is if youre able to
stand up at all he concluded


amazing stories

  when the chemist returned to the deck house an hour
later it had grown perceptibly darker and snow was
whipping by the ports with a lively breeze behind it
fellows was at his instrument and was just speaking
to the skipper as he entered the control room the
cerberus is about five and a quarter miles ahead sir
shes making about thirteen miles

  the skipper nodded take another reading in ten
minutes and after that keep a check on her till visibility
weve got to be cautious in this weather he peered
ahead into the shifting veil of snow i guess ill
switch tocable control-cant see much out and the trail
is beginning to drift over

  he put on a pair of headphones while fellows ex-
plained to hamilton theres a cable carrying one
hundred cycle alternating current laid under the trail
we are equipped with a coil below that picks up the im-
pulse and all you have to do is to keep the sound in
the phone at a maximum intensity and you stick on the
trail -

  he turned to his range finder to take another reading
of the distance of the approaching freighter this in-
strument was a modified directional ultra-short wave
transmitter and receiver with which all company tractors
were equipped it operated on exactly the same principle
as military range finders except that it utilized extremely
short radio waves instead of light waves the instru-
ment indicated now that the cerberus was only two miles
ahead accordingly they proceeded at reduced speed till
a light gleamed through the falling snow and rapidly re-
solved itself into the dazzling headlight of the other ma-
chine with a thunderous roar its snow-covered bulk
passed and was gone

for several hours they continued the monotonous
progress southward hamilton retired to the saloon
and tried to read but everything jiggled too much for
comfort so he went into the little electric galley and
fixed himself a cup of hot coffee and a sandwich oc-
casional glances through the port revealed an ever dark-
ening landscape and an increase in the strength of the
wind until a regular antarctic blizzard was howling and
shrieking around the boanerges it was impossible to
see more than twenty or thirty feet they were navigating
entirely by cable piloting

  late in the evening the odometer registered ninety miles
from little america the route swerved easterly and
began to climb-this was the start of rhyker pass which
penetrated the charles bob mountains at a maximum
altitude of nine thousand feet the roar of the exhausts
became a little deeper as the skipper advanced the throt-
tle and increased the drive ratio hamilton went for-
ward into the control room dark but for the glimmer of
a few instruments the powerful headlight bored ahead
with a shaft of brilliant light which was soon lost in
the almost horizontal drive of small dry snowflakes
gradually the slope became greater the engines were
beginning to labor shadowy cliffs were closing in on
either side the route began to twist and serpentine the
headlight dimly picked out black piled up masses of rock
sweeping out into the night-the base ribs of the moun-
tains through which they picked their way the tor-
tuous route kept the skipper on the alert as with skilful
manipulation of the throttle and ratio levers he jockeyed
the huge tractor through winding canyons around hair-
pin turns always following the sinuosity of the trail

as it fought its way upward suddenly he threw out his
clutches and flicked off the throttle the roar of the tur-
bines died and left a silence broken by the whistling of
the wind

  whats up  ejaculated fellows from his seat before
the radio instrument

  the cable note has stopped the skipper took off
his phones and handed them over they were silent
there was a momentary pause as the two men looked
questioningly at each other it was interrupted by the
characteristic high-pitched hum from the phones which
had suddenly become active again

  what the devil ive never had that happen before
the skipper switched off his engines phone cable sta-
tions eight and nine see what they have to say

  fellows worked at his instrument for a few minutes
they noticed the break too he reported but they
cant explain it the operator at number nine thinks
the reactance of this section has been thrown out a few
henrys probably due to a slight break or disarrange-
ment somewhere along the route

  tell him we are proceeding at reduced speed the
skipper replied theres nothing else to do-we cant
sit on our treads out here indefinitely

  the turbines resumed speed and the boanerges
lurched forward into the obscurity in her control room
the men peered anxiously ahead in a useless attempt
to pierce the impenetrable curtain of snow and gloom
the cable note was steady again and everything seemed
normal but hamilton was troubled by a fear of what
might lie just outside of their tantalizingly small range
of vision a foolish nameless fear for what beast or
entity hostile to man existed in these barren regions
the grim antarctic was a jealous enemy it neither per-
mitted nor required allies or rivals in its cruel war
against mankind

  for an hour more they continued their tortuous up-
ward progress the skipper was unusually alert for
signs of danger-perhaps a snow slide across their path
or a break in some bridge or fill which carried the trail
across a bad spot but nothing out of the way happened
except perhaps when he half turned in his seat and
muttered to hamilton i could have sworn that was
thunderstone cut we just passed through-and if it
was we ought to be turning about fifteen degrees easterly
right now-but ill trust the cable before i trust my eyes
in this weather 

  the route was becoming more and more uneven and
difficult the snow in the pass through which they were
progressing seemed to have drifted to an unusual depth
the boanerges heaved and pitched violently her engines
roaring at full blast as she nosed and fought her way
forward a burst of profanity came over the engine-
room telephone from frazer enraged over the way his
precious turbines were being overloaded

  with overwhelming unexpectedness a rocky wall
loomed in the headlights beam simultaneously the
boanerges lurched sideways and downwards-her crew
thrown in a heap at the lower end of the steeply tilted
control room like despairing souls the turbines shrieked
in crescendo up from the engine room the skipper had
released the clutches but had been hurled from his seat
before he could turn off the power the shriek died
away to silence as the automatic over-speed relays came
into action

  the three men untangled themselves from the heap
south polar beryllium limited



into which they had been hurled hamilton felt an acute
pain in his left wrist-probably sprained fellows was
cut in the forehead-the skipper was bruised but not
seriously injured

  he scrambled to his feet and ran aft to the engine
room companionway anybody hurt he roared down
the stream of vituperation which shot up from below
assured him that all was well the traditional con-
tempt of the black gang for the deck force was very much
alive and possessed an eloquent voice in mr frazer

simultaneously the boanerges lurched sideways and
downwards-her crew thrown in a heap at the lower
end of the steeply tilted control room


amazing stories

  he returned to the saloon and yanked on his boots
and furs fellows he ordered inspect all apparatus
and equipment for damage mr hamilton as a passen-
ger i must ask you to remain out of the way and not
endanger yourself im going outside to look over the
situation he snatched up a powerful electric hand
lantern and hurried aft through the main corridor and
up the sloping deck to the port entrance way a gust
of snow and chill swooped in as he stepped out and the
heavy door clanged shut

  hamilton could see the flash of his lantern through
the ports as he made his way forward along the narrow
deck which ran on either side of the deckhouse his
muffled form swung over the side by the boarding
ladder and passed out of sight

  inside the great stranded machine there was silence
broken intermittently by the clink and scrape of metal
or the occasional whirr of motors as the crew tested ap-
paratus for breakage hamilton was in the control room
dividing his attention between the radio man tinkering
with his equipment and the murk outside in an attempt
to make out the skippers light it winked and flickered
below under the great tilted hull of the boanerges he
watched fascinated through the observation window
the light moved slowly aft as the skipper examined the
condition of the immense caterpillar treads suddenly
the tiny beam swung about flashed crazily a jet of
flame pierced the darkness beside it accompanied by a
faint report which reached his ears through the thick
glass the lamp flew upward in a glittering arc to fall
and extinguish itself

  hamilton leaped away from the window a cry of
warning on his lips but the same instant a staccato
rapping on the glass arrested him he spun around and
looked-a figure muffled in snow whitened packa was
standing outside a kruf automatic in its mittened hand
covering the two men within hamilton stared frozen
with astonishment but fellows dashed to his radio tele-
phone instantly the automatic blazed and the whole in-
strument panel burst in a sheet of flame where the ex-
plosive bullet struck it the lights blinked out and
hamilton dashed in the direction of the corridor to es-
cape the murderous fire through the observation window

  a little light was gleaming through the engine room
companion way aft he leapt towards it in a frantic effort
to get out of the way of the next shot simultaneously
a man stepped into the corridor from the side entrance
hamilton crashed into him and clutched wildly his im-
petus carried the two men over the edge and they hurled
down the iron ladder into the depths of the boanerges
bowling over frazer who had just started up to in-
vestigate the shooting they landed at the bottom a
fearful scramble of arms and legs frazer enraged at
the unreasonable assault and hamilton almost out of the
running from the battering and the pain in his wrist

  bandits he croaked as he got dizzily to his feet
they shot the skipper when he went outside-and i
think they got fellows

  this one of them snapped out frazer leaning over
the third man who sprawled out on the steel floor un-
gainly in his heavy furs he had been knocked un-
conscious

  hey tom he called to his assistant lock up this
fellow in the store-room when he comes to im going
out to take a look at these bandits has anyone here
any firearms

  no one had not even the unconscious captive-prob-
ably it had been jarred out of his hand when hamilton
struck him then give me a monkey wrench and
ill show them a thing or two growled the old engineer
this begins to sound like old times

  wait a minute put in hamilton give the younger
generation a chance mr frazer i want to join the
party too i ran off like a scared rabbit and left fel-
lows

  frazer had armed himself with a pinch bar and
hamilton seized the largest wrench he could find the
two crept up the steel ladder and poked their heads
cautiously above the corridor deck immediately they
were dazzled by the beam of a powerful electric torch
while a gruff voice ordered them to git below and stay
below by way of hastening their descent a quinn air
pistol sighed somewhere in the darkness and its vicious
little pellet smacked into the bulkhead behind them

  frazer grunted as he turned to descend well i
guess well have to accept the invitation but i sure wish
we could return his calling card

  hamilton said nothing he had glimpsed an overturned
suitcase and he suddenly realized what the bandits were
after the ionic separator or rather the plans of it
they were all in a neat bundle in his suitcase in the
saloon a sickening impotency overwhelmed him as
if to emphasize it the heavy steel hatch over the engine-
room companionway clanged shut they were prisoners
neatly bottled up in the interior of the boanerges

  isnt there any other way out he demanded of the
mechanic

  nope laconically replied that grease-smeared indi-
vidual as he seated himself in the crook of the port oil-
feed manifold and pulled out a pipe less you can crawl
out one o them ports he waved in the direction of a
small heavy glass light set in a deep recess of the engine-
room walls hamilton hurried over to it cupped his
hands to shield his eyes and peered out at first he could
make out nothing but gradually he saw through the
murk the shape of a small motor sled a dim light burning
in its cabin it lay directly under the port-hole like a
tug beside an ocean liner

  he beckoned to frazer and showed him his discovery
if we could only smash up that sled-then theyd have
no way to escape he turned excitedly to the engineer

a heavy piece of iron dropped out of this port-

  -wouldnt work cut in frazer we couldnt get
anything heavy enough through here to damage that
machine

  weve got to think of something hamiltons voice
was tense-ive got it-dont your discharge hatches
open along this side

  yes

  whatve you got in the compartment above us
let me see-stowings not my job- frazer knitted
his brow-

  cement cut in the laconic engineer suddenly come
to life- two hundred bags of it-twenty tons-thatll
smash em he dashed over to the control panel of the
hydraulically operated hatch locks hamilton hurried
up the ladder and secured the hatch to the deck house
firmly from the inside

  well make our prison into a fort he muttered
thats double-crossing em

  the engineer threw over the lever for number three
hatch lock to release there was a momentary roar over-
south polar beryllium limited



head as twenty tons of cement slid out of the open hatch
the crunch of the smashing motor sled was scarcely
audible through the thud of the falling bags

overhead was a cry of alarm and the patter of
feet on the deck

  wed better put out the lights here cautioned frazer
if they can break through the hatch and get at us now
theyll do it they waited in darkness for the attack
which came soon the bandits enraged at the coup
which cut off their means of retreat were apparently de-
termined on revenge the steel hatch rang to the impact
of an explosion which was followed immediately by
another

  kruf impact nitro shells--thirty-eight calibre i
should say muttered frobisher if thats all they
have theyll never get through that hatch

  the attackers seemed to realize the futility of attempt-
ing to penetrate the steel-bound vitals of the great
tractor sounds of an angry altercation came through to
the men within there seemed to be only two voices-
apparently the gang consisted of only three men and
one was locked in the storeroom

  frazer approached the hatch and shouted up ahoy
above you might as well give up peaceably if you
dont well just turn off the deckhouse heat and sit tight
till you freeze to death i presume ye arent crazy
enough to try to mush out o here and you know you
cant get at us

  there was silence after a time the two voices broke
into argument they increased in violence apparently
there was fatal dissension the argument culminated
in a deafening series of detonations on the hatch top-
someone must have discharged the whole magazine of a
kruf against it there was a yell of rage a clatter of
metal and the sound of heavy running footsteps for a
few minutes all was silence then the footsteps returned
and someone rapped sharply on the hatch

  all right you below i know when im licked open
iier up and lemme get warm i been runnin around in
this dam icebox long enough

  okay sang out frazer well open this hatch a
couple of inches and you drop your artillery through
no funny business or youll stay there and freeze solid
he released the fastenings so the hatch could be raised
a few inches and immediately a mittened hand dropped
two quinn air pistols and an automatic hamilton and
the mechanic picked them up and covered the stairway
as frazer released the catch a man in heavy furs ap-
peared in the opening his hands raised above his head
he descended the stairs sullenly under the intent gaze of
the three men

  search this fellow for any more weapons snapped
frazer then lock him in the storeroom along with the
other he goes to the sheriff at new sidney with a
charge of piracy and murder-he swung toward ham-
ilton-you and tom here take these pistols and well
look for the other one we heard

  no need of that growled the captive he went
plumb nuts and jumped off the deck out there and
theres been no murder done here either i plugged your
skipper with a hypo bullet and hes still asleep-in the
washroom along with your radioman lucky for me
strauber didnt blow him to pieces i sure wouldnt have
taken on this job if id a known that guy would try to
bump off everybody

  strauber you say  asked hamilton

  yeh he was the chief of this idea crazy little dark
fellow-but he had brains and he had this job all figured
out fine we was gonna hold up the payroll but we
got word somethin mighty valuable was cornin through
on this machine everything was going fine till you
dumped that load of stuff damn his brains why
didnt he think of that he sat down wearily and
after two weeks of the hardest work i ever did
hamilton and frazer went up after the two casualties
they were locked in the washroom the skipper in a
stupor from the effects of the hypodermic bullet and
fellows weak from loss of blood and dangerously chilled
the deckhouse had become bitter cold with the air from
the broken window they carried the two men down
to the warm engine room dressed their wounds and
made them as comfortable as possible

  what are the chances of getting these men medical
attention hamilton asked frazer the engineer
thought that the section patrol would be along pretty
soon since the failure of communication of the boaner-
ges would certainly arouse the operators at cable stations
eight and nine

  youre wrong about any section patrol cornin along
here said the morose bandit whom they had not yet
locked up because he seemed willing to give information
were six miles off the trail now

  youre crazy were on the cable

  youre on a cable-but not the right one just below
thunderstone cut we spliced on another section and
carried it up this blind canyon then we ran it back
over the divide to the main cable again to keep the cir-
cuit goin we put automatic switches at the splices
to cut the fake section in and the main one out just be-
fore you were due in forty-five minutes theyll throw
out this section again and nobody can tell theres been
any tampering-that is not until they dig up the whole
thing some day and find our splices boy that was
some job

  and now somebodys got to mush six miles to the
fork and flag the section patrol said frazer grimly in
a storm like this thats no childs play but these men
have got to have medical attention

  wait a minute interrupted hamilton how soon
will those automatic switches disconnect this section of
the cable  he asked their captive

  i think in about ten or twelve minutes now

  then hurry frazer i want to get at that cable and
send a message over it get together something to dig
with and an axe or a knife or something to cut the insula-
tion

  the two men yanked on their heavy clothing and seized
a few tools a coil of bare wire and an electric lantern
hamilton led the way up into the deckhouse now rapidly
filling with driven snow and out to the deck and down
the boarding ladder

  after a few minutes of scrambling around in the snow
underneath the great snout of the boanerges they found
the cable about twenty inches below the surface five
feet was the regulation depth of the main cable-it was
fortunate that strauber had not been able to lay his false
section properly

as soon as they uncovered it hamilton hacked away
at the lead sheathing and insulation till he bared the

foreword

i	write these words in a room perched high in
one of new yorks highest towers beneath me in
the fading sunlight of late afternoon there stretches
the vast mass of the mighty citys structures new york
ft s-hut such a new york as never man looked upon
before and it is with its familiar but infinitely strange
panorama before my eyes that i start now this record
of the great change

my name is allan harker dr allan harker

i	could say for it has been seven years
since i took the degree and with it a
position on the biological staff of manhat-
tan university that was a great day for
me manhattan was one of the most renowned of east-
ern universities and its biological department in par-
ticular was known to scientists the world over this was
due not only to the departments unrivalled equipment




amazing stories

but also in greater part to two of the scientists who
worked in it dr howard grant head of the depart-
ment and dr raymond ferson his associate very
proud i was to have won so soon the opportunity of
working with those two world-famed biologists and
even prouder i was when in the next years my work
came gradually to link my name with theirs

  grant and ferson and harker-we were known to
scientists across half the world it was grant of course
the eldest of us who was best known a tall saturnine-
faced and dark-browed scotsman his utter and undivided
passion for research was a byword among us it used to
be said though not in his hearing that grant would have
vivisected his own grandmother if he thought some new
principle might be learned by it all respected the man
or the mans achievements but he never had a tithe of
the popularity that was fersons ferson was in fact
a complete contrast to his superior a short-statured man
of middle age with unruly hair and beard and warm
brown friendly eyes as for myself the third of the
trio i had neither the brilliant scientific mind of grant
nor the keen vision of ferson but by dint of ceaseless
plodding with monotonous details i had built for myself
a reputation that linked my name with theirs

  aside from our professorial duties in the universitys
lecture-rooms we had each of us our separate work i
was plodding away with my dull experiments on cell-
grouping which i expected would some day yield a
theory that would astound all cytologists now and then

i	received help on some difficult point from ferson who
was himself immersed in an attempt to demolish the
snelsen-morrs re-vertebration theory by prying into the
interior structure of innumerable unheard-of lizards
grant however never received or gave any help keep-
ing his work entirely to himself we had gathered from
his rare references to it that he had been working for
months on one of the broader problems of evolutionary
science but that was all we knew and we were as
amazed as any when grant published the statement that
touched off the sensational evolution controversy

  it is needless for me to give here all the details of the
thing it is sufficient to say that grant in his statement
announced that he had solved at last the greatest enigma
of biological science-ttiat he had discovered the cause
of evolution

  one can understand what an uproar that statement
created and was bound to create for the cause of evo-
lutionary change has always been the supreme problem
of biology long ago darwin and wallace and lamarck
and their fellows had laid the processes of evolution bare
they had shown to an astonished world that life on earth
was not static in forms that had always existed and
always would exist but that it was in constant change
and movement up through constantly changing forms
the eohippus had changed had evolved into the horse
and in future ages would be something different still
the great felines that had roamed earth had evolved into
smaller forms and into tame cats a certain branch of
ape-like forms had evolved into great hairy troglodytes
and then into modern men all life on earth was con-
stantly changing evolving forced ever upward through
the diverging channels of evolution into new and differ-
ent forms

  but what force was it that pressed earths life thus
upward through the paths of change what force was
it that caused all this vast slow evolution of earths crea-
tures into different creatures that had begun with the

first jelly-like life-forms on earth and had forced the
tide of life up from them to the forms of today that still
was slowly changing them that question none could
answer environment did not explain it for though
environment had certain effects on the life-forms in it
it was not responsible for that deep vast tide of upward
evolution mendelism had seemed for a time to suggest
an explanation but had failed in the end to do so some
great force there was all knew that pressed life always
up the path of evolution but none had ever guessed what
that force might be and the thing had come to be ac-
cepted at last as one of the insoluble problems of science
and now grant claimed that he had solved it

  for long grants statement said i have held that
since evolutionary change is unquestionably caused by
some definite and omnipresent force acting upon all life
on earth it should be possible to discover the nature of
that force i will not recount the work of months which

i	have spent in constant search for this force but will
say that finally i have been successful have identified the
force which my experiments show beyond all doubt to
be the single force responsible for the upward course of
evolution on earth that force is a vibratory force a
vibration unknown to earths physicists prior to my
discovery of it which has as its source the sun

  the sun we know is a vast mass of incandescent
matter which ceaselessly pours out part of its matter
transformed into energy the energy thus formed
flooding out in all directions from the sun through
space takes various forms at a certain vibratory fre-
quency it takes the form of light and illuminates our
day at another frequency it is radiant heat warming
our world at still another it is the cosmic ray so re-
cently discovered there are many others known to us
and still more of which we know nothing as yet a vast
welter of vibratory forces flooding endlessly outward
from the sun and it is one of those vibrations one which
we well may call the evolution vibration which is re-
sponsible for the evolutionary change of all life on earth

  in this there is nothing astounding the suns
various vibratory forces affect all living things on earth
profoundly each in a different manner without the
light-vibrations earths life would fade and die the ab-
sence of the ultra-violet waves being fatal in time with-
out its heat-radiations all life would freeze and without
this evolution vibration playing ceaselessly upon earth all
life upon earth would no longer be pressed upward
through the paths of evolution would slip back swiftly
down those paths down the myriad roads up which it
has surged for so long for not only is it this evolution
vibration that forces earths life upward on the way of
change it is this vibration that keeps earths life from
slipping backward

  thus for grants statement to ferson and me it was
as astonishing as to the rest of the scientific world for
not until then did we learn what work it was that had
occupied grant for so long yet even we two i think
were surprised at the sensation that that statement
caused always the work of dr grant had been accepted
almost without question so great was his reputation and
so brilliant his achievements but with the publication
of this amazing new theory of his the general dislike of
the man that had always lain latent burst forth into a
storm of criticism

  it was admitted that the new vibratory force which
grant had discovered did apparently exist since other
scientists working on his data had corroborated his
world atavism



work on it but it was denied by grants numerous
critics that this force was what he claimed it to be-the
cause of evolutionary change it was impossible they
stated that such a so-called evolution vibration could in
reality be responsible for the course of evolution on
earth and it was even more absurd to suggest as grant
had done that were that force withdrawn were the evo-
lution vibration to cease to play on earth from the sun
the living beings of earth would slip swiftly backward
on the road of change

  the controversy over the thing grew in fact to a
point of bitterness unprecedented in scientific discussion
a bitterness intensified by the comments of the saturnine
and black-tempered grant in a series of sardonic state-
ments he compared his critics to those who had derided
the work of darwin and his fellows and indulged in
some rather acrid personalities these in turn provoked
fiercer attacks and the whole matter grew thus quickly
into an unseemly intellectual brawl to ferson and
myself the whole controversy seemed a useless one be-
cause in the course of time experimentation by other
scientists would definitely prove or disprove grants
theory yet neither of us ventured to suggest that to
our bitter superior and so the wrangle grew in intensity
in the next days until it suddenly came to a head

  it was the elderly president rogers of manhattan
university who brought the thing to a focus he and
the universitys other officials had been growing more
and more restive under the criticisms that grants con-
troversy was bringing on the school and so at last he
suggested that a meeting be held at which grant could
lay his theories and data before his fellow-scientists in
their entirety this grant accepted and so too did most
biologists of any note within traveling distance of new
york so widely had the clamor of the dispute spread
and on an afternoon grant rose before several hundred
assembled scientists in one of the universitys lecture-
halls to explain his discovery

  there is little need for me to tell at length of what
took place at that meeting which both ferson and i
attended at the first appearance of dr grant his ene-
mies in the audience grew vocal in their criticisms and
before he had spoken a quarter of an hour the hall was
in such an uproar as a scientific meeting has seldom heard
twice grant made an effort to go on and each time his
voice was drowned by a storm of shouted cries the
president chairman of the meeting was rapping vainly
for order but grant only stood still looking out over
the stormy meeting with a cold contempt in his eyes yet
with a strange fire in them quietly he rolled up the
data-sheets in his hand and thrust them into his pocket
and as quietly stepped forward to the platforms edge
something in his bearing in his expression quickly
quieted the noisy throng before him

  his voice came out over the hall cold and clear you
have not let me give to you the proof for which you
asked he said

  the president stepped to his side said something
rapidly but grant shook his head calmly no proof
that i can give you here would convince you of my
theorys truth i know he told the silent throng before
him but i will give you proof of it yet to you and
to the world i will give a proof such as the world has
never seen before

  before any could move he had walked from the plat-
form and out of the hall a buzz of excited voices
broke out instantly in comment and criticism it was

some hours later before ferson and i got from the
meeting to grants laboratory but grant was not there

  within twenty-four hours more we knew and all at
the university knew that dr grant had disappeared
from the meeting he went to his laboratory burned some
papers there and pocketed others then he went to his
rooms hastily packed a few bags and departed he left
no note no message his action brought to a climax the
whole sensation of the controversy he had precipitated
and grants going was taken by many of his critics as a
confession of the falsity of his position he had had no
close relatives to start a search for him and though to
ferson and me his strange departure seemed astounding
we could explain it no better than others the sensation
subsided and ferson was appointed to head the depart-
ment in place of the vanished scientist our own work
occupied us once more and certainly neither ferson
nor i any more than another guessed what lay behind
grants strange action

it was six months after grants departure that the
great change began

  the first intimation was brought to the public notice
by a new york newspaper in a sensational article
entitled is a new crime wave upon us it pointed
out that in the last few days an unprecedented number
of crimes of violence had taken place

  these were the more appalling in that many seemed
quite without motive in new york alone in those few
days there had been more than a dozen murders mostly
clubbings and stabbings which had apparently been pro-
voked by the slightest of causes in chicago a respected
clerk of middle age had for some annoyance turned sud-
denly and fractured the skulls of three of his associates
with a heavy bar from san francisco and los angeles
had come news of half a dozen holocausts in which one
member of a family had slaughtered or attempted to
slaughter all the others from every part of the land
there were coming reports of the most horrifying crimes
of violence the great majority of which seemed inspired
by the pettiest of causes

  and this same wave of homicidal mania seemed at
work over all the world it was as though hundreds in
earths population had suddenly had their reason
dwarfed and their passions magnified no less than
three solid householders in london had run amuck in
bursts of sadistic fury that had cost a half-score lives
the paris police had taken from the seine more human
bodies many terribly mutilated than had ever been found
in it in a like time before germany was aghast over
two mass-murders of unexampled fiendishness that had
occurred in a rhenish and a silesian village there was
news of an even more terrible slaying in calcutta and
word of murders almost as terrible from almost every
country on the globe

  nor was it murder alone that was stalking the earth
for robberies of the utmost brutality were even more
numerous overshadowed as they were by the greater
horror they were as astonishing in nature for all like
the slayings seemed the result of sudden brutal instincts
or desires uncontrolled by reason small shopkeepers in
american and english towns were struck down for
trifles in the stores of great cities there were those who
snatched childishly at desired objects and attempted a
hopeless escape to the street that was the keynote of all

 sadism of which this word is the adjective is a mental perversion
 towards cruelty


amazing stories

these robberies of all these crimes-the unreasoning
childishness of them for the great part of them were
attempted under circumstances which should have shown
to even the most dull-witted that there was no chance of
success

  it was a wave of strange and terrible crime indeed
that was sweeping over all the earth the newspapers
concerned themselves with it to the exclusion of all else
soon they sought for explanations what had caused
this sudden release of the most brutal passions of num-
berless people many were the answers an eminent
scientist declared that the nerve-racking strain of modern
civilization had reached such a pitch that the human
mind could no longer stand it was giving way beneath it
many wrote serious letters to the press denouncing the
motion pictures as schools of crime others defended
them and while the cause was thus argued the great
wave of crime and utter lawlessness that had rolled
across earth seemed increasing in volume

  the number of deaths by violence that were each day
recorded had grown now to an appalling figure mur-
derous attacks were common in every one of earths
great cities men hurled themselves at each others
throats apparently for a word a gesture nor was this
all a strange erratic insanity seemed seizing more and
more of earths millions numberless were those re-
ported to the authorities as missing those who had wan-
dered causelessly away from home and family the
worlds roads held an unprecedented number of vagrant
wanderers

  but in a few days more even this astounding wave of
appalling crime was dwarfed in importance by more as-
tounding and more terrible happenings accidents a
great number of them fatal to many were occurring in
every part of earth in an amount that was all but
incredible

  more than a hundred people had gone to death in the
crash of two thundering passenger trains in colorado
a crash that had been due to the failure of an engineer to
heed the plainest of signals two train wrecks in north-
ern england had taken a toll of life almost as great and
there were reports of many other crashes from various
parts of earth in every one the accident had been due
to the inexplicable failure of the human element the
failure of dispatcher or switchman or engineer to per-
form the duty that habit should have made automatic
in one case that of the austrian disaster the crash had
been directly caused by the sudden craziness of a switch-
man who for some slight grievance had sent a long
passenger-train crashing through an open switch and
down an embankment

  there was news as terrible from the seas wireless
reports flashed thick with word of ships that had blun-
dered fatally on rocks or shoals by fault of helmsman or
navigating officer the greater part of these fortu-
nately were freight-ships of medium and small size but
one case sent a thrill of horror through earth already-
steeped in horror that was when the great transatlantic
liner garonia bound to southampton crashed by night
into the southern irish coast with the resulting loss of
three-fourths of the thousand humans it carried and
that wreck like the others was due to an utterly inex-
plicable failure of the ships personnel

  smaller in magnitude but taking a total of far more
lives were the unnumbered accidents that took place in
the thickly populated and highly mechanized countries of
north america and europe the number of automobile

deaths always staggering america reached a stunning
total in those last fateful days of september crashes
took place at every corner and the running down of
pedestrians became a common occurrence everywhere
many cars mowed a path of death through street and
sidewalk before they were halted their drivers losing
apparently all faculty of control of them

  and in mill and shop and factory deaths grim hand
was reaping as thickly men upon whom the lives of
many depended suddenly lost control of their machines
and sent those many to death countless others were
mangled or crushed to death by the great mechanisms
they had operated for years without mishaps airplane
crashes became so numerous that many sections of the
world peremptorily forbade all further flying until the
cause of it all could be ascertained it was as though
more and more of the masses of men were becoming
incapable of handling the mechanisms of conducting the
operations that they had been executing for years was
mankind going collectively insane

  it seemed insanity indeed that was sweeping earth
now riots had taken place on a small scale here and
there in those days but it was not until after the first of
october that the first of the great outbreaks took place
in london crowds of wandering men and women
began the looting of shops the breaking of win-
dows and the rioting swiftly spread so swiftly did it
spread in fact that by the time the troops called to
suppress it appeared on the scene unestimated thousands
were engaged in the wild search for plunder at the
order to fire an irregular volley from the troops killed
scores but in the pitched mob battle that followed scores
of the soldiers took the side of the looters the combat
between mob and soldiers was forgotten and the battle
became a wild scene of brutality and violence in which
hundreds were slain and trampled in the end it re-
quired machine-guns to disperse them

  a similar great outbreak in new york was curbed
quickly a day later by the use of planes and tear-bombs
but two days after there came a huge riot of unexampled
bloodiness in chicago which cost several thousand lives
and which resulted in the burning of a third of the city 
beginning as a race riot and developing into a savage
general battle for loot it was notable for the fact that
the troops called to suppress it broke up even before
they reached the scene and occupied themselves in brutal
looting and battle of their own and a score of great
riots in the other cities of earth had similar results

  civilization seemed crashing with this oncoming dis-
solution of its organization and institutions had hu-
manity gone insane indeed  swiftly with full realiza-
tion of the peril upon it by then a conference of the
worlds most noted scientists had been called some days
before at new york to explain and to halt if possible
this wave of seeming insanity that was gripping more of
the masses of humanity each day and that was disinte-
grating civilization

  but when those scientists met the world learned that
they had a hundred different explanations of the thing
no two agreeing the famous american alienist who
had voiced his opinion days before reiterated his belief
that the minds of men were giving way en masse beneath
the strain of modern civilization a rumanian bacte-
riologist claimed that the thing was the result of a con-
tagious new brain disease spreading over earth and
claimed even to have isolated the bacterium of that dis-
ease the scientists gripped seemingly by something of
world atavism



the erratic condition of mind they were striving to ex-
plain argued these theories and others with utmost pas-
sion sometimes attacking each other an english
physicist who suggested that earth was passing through
strange mind-affecting gases in space was assaulted by
the proponent of another theory and still more furious
and incredulous the world learned was the reception
given to the explanation of a new york biologist named
ferson who claimed that the whole great terror was the
result of the human races slipping backward on the road
of evolution

  world atavism a throwback of all the worlds life
on the road of evolution so they learned ferson had
cried to the assembled scientists all earths animal life
is beginning to slip back and man as the most recently
developed animal is slipping first is going back toward
the savage state toward the cave-man or troglodyte
toward the ape he is losing control of his passions as
he goes back which accounts for the violence that now
fills earth and he is losing the mental capacity of
modern man which accounts for his inability to operate
longer our modern machines a world atavism that is
beginning with the atavism of the human races

  but what could cause such world atavism as that
the incredulous scientists had cried

  the evolutionary theory of my former associate dr

grant- ferson had begun but was interrupted by a

chorus of derisive shouts provoked by the mention of the
scientist whose ridiculous theory had been exploded

  so ferson had been forced from the meeting by the
furious scientists who seemed seized indeed with the
erratic craziness that was gripping the world another
day they advanced and argued their theories theories
that grew ever more impossible more incoherent and
then the meeting dissolved in a general riotous brawl of
the arguing scientists they in common with the rest
of the races of men seemed incapable longer of calm
thought of cool impassioned reasoning two were
killed throttled in the brawl that ended the meeting and
the rest scattered they were not followed or punished
for now the disintegration of humanitys institutions had
become such that crime was unheeded

  men were outrivalling each other in mad action those
in high places as in low were gripped by the insanity that
had apparently seized earth and from the cabinets and
congresses of a score of nations came declarations of
war against other nations for the slightest of reasons or
for none at all england the united states france
germany italy turkey japan and china-these and
a dozen others issued frenzied and incoherent calls to
arms but they were unheeded even war now could
not penetrate the unreasoning minds of men armies
had broken up all discipline and organization vanishing
a few who tried to keep their soldiers in line found that
the men could no longer handle the great guns and instru-
ments of war found that most of them were incapable
of the operation of rifles

  civilization was crashing with a prolonged roar of
falling laws and institutions and customs echoing across
the world the ordinary methods of transportation and
production having completely broken down days before
the stream of food into the great cities had abruptly
ceased the brutal throngs that filled those cities sub-
sisted by looting the existing food supplies for a time
but soon these were exhausted and then terrible battles
took place between the rioters for food which they had
found battles they were of hordes of ragged brutes of

  savages who fought with knives or with their bare hands
in the streets only occasionally was a shot heard for
almost none there was now with sufficient dull glimmer
of intelligence to manipulate a gun

  in the shadow of the tall towers of new york and in
the brick and stone acres of london  and the boulevards
of paris thousands and hundreds of thousands of these
savages swarmed the ways choked with corpses of the
slain at night they crouched fearfully in hallways and
offices and corridors the vast cities lying dark and silent
beneath the stars shapes of prowling animals were
being seen in some of them by night no wheel turned
in all the world now for none seemed left with intelli-
gence enough to operate the simplest machine

  and these swarms that had been human were changing
in appearance too the men were unshaven and hairier
it seemed much clothing had been discarded crude belts
that held knives or the like weapons being retained they
crouched now as they walked their step a watchful
animal-like one from under shaggy brows they stared
at each other small crude family-groups held together
the man battling other men for the possession of food
some managed to kill animals and wore the skins

  they were troglodytes millions of them men such as
the world had seen thousands of years before as hu-
manity had been then they were troglodytes wandering
through the cities and towns that they themselves had
built staring in wondering fear about them at things
the purpose of which they could not understand but
most had no wonder only a brutal lack of interest in all
save food and mating and sleep there were no fires for
all had lost the use of fire and feared it now

  driven by hunger great masses of them were pouring
out of the cities into the countryside to hunt roots and
herbs and to kill small animals for food they made
rude shelters for a time then abandoned them for caves
and crannies in the rocks they ceased to use knives or
spears they could but throw great stones at each other
or wield chance clubs or fight with bare hands

  many had remained in the cities and among them was
more fighting with each day they were changing far-
ther it seemed going farther back along the long road
of change that man had ascended so slowly through the
ages and that he was slipping back upon so swiftly

  the streets of new york and glasgow and constan-
tinople and yokohama saw them these animal-like ape-
like hordes that wandered there ape-like they were
becoming indeed swiftly hairier of body more crouch-
ing of gait stooping occasionally in moving to rim on
hands and feet clothing they had discarded the frag-
mentary mumbled speech that they had kept until days
before had given way to a meaningless medley of barking
shouts and cries whose tone conveyed their crude at-
tempt at communication they roamed the great cities
in little groups or tribes of each of which one was the
strongest the tyrant the acknowledged lord

  and now they were changing still were running
more on hands and feet walking upright less back
from man to troglodyte and from troglodyte to ape had
the human races gone and now were slipping back still
into the animal races from which the apes had come
world atavism-and it was wiping the last human-like
forms from the face of earth

of this great change that in days swept man back into
the brutal forms of dead ages i allan harker was
a witness from the first for it was at new york that


amazing stories

the early manifestations of the change had been first
noticed in that increasing wave of terrible crime that
was in days to rage over the whole earth

  neither ferson nor i of course had any suspicion of
the things real magnitude in those first days we fol-
lowed with the same astonishment that held most in the
world the astounding growth of crime and violence
but it was remote from our own interests and we were
both very much absorbed in our differing work of experi-
mentation we spent more time on that work indeed in
those days than before for both ferson and i seemed
to have lost a little of our usual skill and knowledge i
know that he caught himself in inexplicable lapses and

i	know that i usually the most patient of biologists for-
got myself in sudden impatient rage on one or two occa-
sions and smashed retorts and test-tubes about me
neither of us dreamed of course that we were being
affected by the same strange forces that were releasing
humanitys passions in a carnival of crime

  but when a little later the great wave of crime that
was making earth hideous was made more terrible by
the innumerable inexplicable accidents that were occur-
ring ferson became thoughtful he deserted his own
white-tiled laboratories for the universitys psychological
test-rooms with their strange recording instruments and
spent hours there carrying out intricate tests of the reac-
tions of himself and others it was after two days of
such tests when the fatal accidents occurring everywhere
were taking toll of thousands of lives daily and when
almost all industrial activity was slowing and stopping
because of them that ferson came back his countenance
as i had never seen it

  ive found it allan he said quietly the cause of
all this terror-these innumerable crimes and accidents
and riotings

  the cause of them  i repeated uncomprehendingly
and he nodded

  yes and that cause is world atavism an atavism a
throwback of all the worlds animal life that is begin-
ning with man as the most recently developed animal and
that is taking place before our eyes taking place in
ourselves even

  world atavism i gasped but ferson-that such
a thing could be--its inconceivable

  he shook his head not inconceivable you remem-
ber grant and his theory that the evolution vibrations
from the sun were what had pushed earths life up the
road of evolution and you remember that grant
said that were those evolution vibrations to cease to
reach earth from the sun all earths life would slip
swiftly back upon that road 

  i remember i said but how could such a thing
happen what could ever halt the play of the suns
evolution vibrations on earth

fersons eyes were somber i do not know what
could he said slowly but i think i know who could
ferson i cried you dont for an instant think

that grant-

  i do think so he said his voice steelly grant dis-
covered the existence of the evolution vibrations-he
alone of men knew all concerning them do you remem-
ber what he said when they ref used to let him explain his
theory even at that meeting  he said  will give you
proof of this i will give you proof yet of this theory
and such a proof as the world has never seen before
my mind was reeling then you think that when
grant disappeared-that he-

  i think that that great proof that grant promised in
his rage to give the world is the world atavism that is
upon humanity now i think that grant in some incon-
ceivable way has used his knowledge and his power to
deflect or dampen the evolution vibrations coming toward
earth from the sun and that it is because of the absence
of those vibrations that earths life is slipping backward
but where will it stop  i exclaimed

  it will not stop harker-this tremendous change has
only begun man the most recently evolved of all ani-
mals is changing first and will go back through troglo-
dyte and ape to the forms before them back through
changing beast-forms by then the other animals of
earth will be changing also thrown back along the evolu-
tionary road and that great atavism will continue until
earths life has all changed back into the first crude pro-
toplasmic forms from which eons ago it sprung

  but what can we do i cried there must be some
way of stopping this

  there is only one way he said grant is causing
this great world atavism is shutting off the suns evolu-
tion vibrations from earth by projecting toward the sun
no doubt a great dampening or neutralizing vibration
that stifles them annihilates them at their source we
must find grants whereabouts must destroy whatever
apparatus he is using to do that

  yet if all are changing-we two also must be chang-
ing  i exclaimed and he nodded

  we two are already a little affected as all men are
more or less our lapses of memory the difficulties we
have in our work now these things in the last days are
the result of this world atavism in us just as the crimes
and accidents filling earth are and we two must pro-
tect ourselves against this tremendous change whatever
we do for on us depends the one chance of halting
grants terrible work the world will never believe that
that dread work is really going on until it is too late so
you and i must not change

  ferson went swiftly on to explain his idea this was
none other than to construct two small projectors that
would each automatically and ceaselessly generate arti-
ficial evolution vibrations vibrations affecting a limited
range as the suns vibrations had affected all earth
these projectors in their compact cases could be worn
on our bodies by each of us without being noticeable and
would keep each of us always thus in the range of the
vital vibrations so that we would not be affected by the
world-wide absence of that which was causing this world
atavism whatever great dampening wave grant was
sending out toward the sun to neutralize its evolution
vibrations would not of course affect the vibrations of
our own little projectors

  the next two days saw us at work upon these pro-
jectors the method of producing the evolution vibra-
tions we knew for as i have mentioned they had been
artificially produced in a small way by physicists upon
grants first announcement of his theory the second
day therefore saw our projectors complete small flat
black cases that were strapped to our belts without being
noticeable each holding the tiny but marvelously power-
ful batteries that were the current-source and the com-
pact little generator that automatically and unendingly
released the vital evolution vibrations for a range of
several feet with these completed and working and
secured thus by them from being ourselves affected by
the terrible atavism that was upon the races of man we
began our greater work of locating grant and the appa-
world atavism



ratus by which he was shutting off the suns vibrations
and loosing this horror on the earth

  for horror it had now become and the world was
waking up to its true nature as every sort of brutal pas-
sion was released in terrible crime over it and as the
inexplicable mindlessness of men brought on terrific acci-
dents already a dozen of the greatest governments in
cooperation had called a conference of earths greatest
scientists at new york to explain or to halt at least the
horror that was sweeping earth to that conference
they came with each a different and more incredible ex-
planation of the thing and to it went ferson and i to
give them the true explanation and to turn them toward
the search for grant that might yet save humanity but
that explanation was never given for fersons first men-
tion of world atavism was greeted with incredulous cries
and when he went on to mention grant such a derisive
storm arose that he was forced bodily from the meeting
leaving the scientists disputing fiercely over the most im-
possible of theories supporting and opposing those theo-
ries by blows

  for they like-the rest of humanity seemed incapable
now of clear and sustained thought upon any subject
even ferson and i working day and night in the isolated
upper manhattan laboratories of the university were
able to see clearly what was happening about us we
were living eating sleeping at the laboratories by this
time for all means of transportation and all industrial
activities were ceasing great masses of men roamed
the streets of the city some forming into gangs that
made life terrible for the others the rest engaged in in-
discriminate looting the great london riot and the
abortive outbreak in lower new york had now taken
place and it was evident to all that the last shadow of
law and order in the city was vanishing for more and
more the troops and police who maintained it were en-
gaging in the rioting themselves

  news came still a little in incoherently written and er-
ratically printed sheets for a few days and it was thus
we learned of the huge chicago riot and subsequent fire
it marked the beginning of the end within a few days
more utter lawlessness reigned over new york corpses
lay in its streets and looters were everywhere the uni-
versity buildings deserted now by all but ourselves were
not attacked except on a few occasions by the looting
swarms there being no food or other desirable things in
them and ferson and i had rifles and pistols in our
laboratory to repel the ragged and brutal gangs that
might attack us

  in those terrible days we were occupied heart and soul
in the work of locating grant and whatever mechanism
it was by which he was casting this doom on humanity
it was fersons idea that the great damping wave which
grant must be sending toward the sun to halt the play
of its endless evolution vibrations would affect certain
recording instruments if the correct frequency for their
circuits could be fend once that was found by observ-
ing the amount by which the instruments were affected
at different locations by the waves of the great damping
vibration we could calculate and chart that great waves
source with some degree of accuracy it seemed to me a
very slender chance yet i knew as well as did ferson
that it was the one possible way grant we knew
would have protected himself as we had by a small
artificial projector of the vibrations

  so in those fearful days we worked with the recording
instruments watching them at each new trial for some

indication of the force whose source we sought the
whole great mass of new yorks giant structures that
stretched southward and downward from our laboratory
lay now in complete darkness each night the last wonted
activities of civilization having ceased in it as elsewhere
ragged hordes of savages roamed it savages so hairy and
crouching and brutal of face seeming each day more
prognathous of jaw and slanting of brow and animal-like
of eye that we knew them to be troglodytes cave-men
men such as humanity had been ages before and such as
it was over all earth now

  we saw them occasionally prowling through the uni-
versity grounds in search of food shambling toward us
with lowering brows to attack us when they glimpsed us
but fleeing in fear when we fired over their heads for
none of them could manipulate so complicated a thing as
a firearm all earths hundreds of millions were prowl-
ing their way in just such brutal bands thrown back to
the state that had been mans before historys dawn and
ever more brutal and hairy and animal-like they were
becoming as they slipped back farther still back from
troglodyte to ape mankind was gone transformed into
these still-changing brutes-all except ferson and me

i can not tell now in full of those terrible last days
of change those days in which in our chance glimpses
we saw men making that other terrible step backward
from troglodyte to ape for ferson and i were working
with the speed of utter despair even were grants ter-
rible work to be halted the suns evolution vibrations
again released on earth it would take them untold ages
to raise the brute-like beings about us to the status of
men once more humanity was passing had passed into
the brute around us yet for their sake for the sake of
the humanity that might rise again in the dim future we
kept to our efforts sought still to halt this awful change
that would otherwise not stop until protoplasmic slime
alone was left living on earth

  we had found the correct frequency for the circuits of
our recording instruments and in feverish haste set up
those instruments at intervals of a mile working through
the night the weirdest of work it was the vast citys
streets and structures silent in the night around us the
countless hordes of brute-like beings that once had built
them now cowering in the buildings in ape-like fear of
the nights mysteries we took our readings hastened
back to our laboratory and dawn found us marking those
readings on the great chart-map of the section we had
ready somewhere in that section somewhere near new
york we knew grant lurked with his terrible mecha-
nism our first readings having shown us that and now
as with trembling hands ferson and i drew the graphs
on the big chart we stared for a moment after in com-
plete silence

  those lines converged at a point in a midtown block
of the great city south of us a block occupied by a single
gigantic building whose aspiring tower was in sight of
our laboratorys windows

  for moments ferson and i stared from chart to tower
in silence and then without words we had turned seen
to the filled magazines of the pistols at our belts and
were passing out of the laboratory into the bright sun-
light as silent as ever we started southward

  never were my existence extended a thousand years
could there be blotted from my memory that journey
southward through the silent towers of new york that
ferson and i made then for the great city that lay


amazing stories

silent about us beneath the brilliant noon sunshine was
a city of horror unutterable dead lay thick in its streets
and great dogs already strange and fierce and wolflike
ran in packs among them the rusting wrecks of
smashed automobiles were piled at every corner no
window of all we passed remained intact sidewalks and
streets were sprinkled with shivered glass westward
across the river a great fire was burning in the cities
there pouring a black volume of flame-laced smoke up
to the skies but more terrible than all of these things
were the hordes the swarms of creatures that moved
through the streets and ways about us the countless
creatures that once had been the citys people

  great ape-like creatures they were not apes such as
men had known but ape-like races such as men had
sprung from eons before in groups and packs of scores
they roamed the citys ways covered with thick hair
stooped and crouching of gait the garments that they
had worn as men torn and discarded there was in them
no semblance to humanity they walked stiffly toward
each other stooping to rest hairy forearms on the ground
each few steps they growled and barked in rage or
chattered volubly and meaninglessly the majority were
prowling in wrecked stores for fragments of food
others moved along the streets in a search for small
animals for insects even

  growling in rage their groups came toward ferson and
me as we moved onward but each time a pistol-shot sent
them fleeing from us we moved on never speaking
fersons face icy calm my own brain reeling we came
at last to the base of the giant building that we knew
must hold whatever mechanism grant was using to with-
hold the evolution vibrations from the earth

  ferson turned to speak to me for the first time some-
where in here he whispered we must search harker
-to find grants apparatus-

  and if he is with it i asked but his only answer
was to tighten his grip on the pistol in his hand

  we passed into the great buildings marble entrance
hall a place of dim shadows through which we stum-
bled over prostrate dead we went quickly through the
looted wrecked rooms that had been the luxurious shops
of its first level then the stairs and we were going
upward level after level searching through the immense
buildings numberless offices and rooms in one or two
were dead and some had been wrecked but in none
in no part of the building it seemed were any of the
ape-like throngs that seemed encouraging somehow
and with beating hearts we pressed on upward

  level after level we were high in the immense build-
ing its floors here wre smaller of extent because of its
pyramidal form yet there was no sound from the
shadows about us no sign of what we sought despair
was growing in us for we were high in the great tower
that was the buildings uppermost part and had found
nothing through the shadowy halls we pressed still
and through the silent rooms lit with the gold of the
westward-swinging sun but as we moved up the
narrow stair toward the last and highest level of the
great tower something flamed in fersons eyes as in
mine

  a sound had come from above to our ears a steady
slow clicking as of a great clock pistols in hand we
moved up found ourselves in a small hall at the towers
side the unused elevator-shaft was beside us and the
stairs that led to the roof but before us was the single
door that gave access apparently to the whole space of

the towers uppermost level and from behind it came
the slow clicking to our ears

  as one we crossed the hall toward that door fersons
hand on its knob turned slowly and slowly astound-
ingly the door swung open our pistols lowered for
the moment in our amazement we stepped through
stopped a dozen feet before us stood grant a heavy
automatic in his hand trained upon us

  silence in it grants eyes held ours his dark-
browed powerful face was lit with unholy triumph with
sardonic exultation i saw that before us was the whole
space of the towers highest level thrown into one great
room huge black-cased and powerful batteries were
ranged upon each other in scores at one side of the
room armored cables led from them through incal-
culable generators and transformers to a great object at
the big rooms center it was like a giant searchlight a
dozen feet or more in diameter swung in a frame resem-
bling gimbals so that it could be turned in any direction
the twelve-foot disk inside it glowed silently with white
light and the great thing was turned to face exactly the
sinking sun westward it was slowly following the de-
scending sun turning slowly under the action of a great
clock-mechanism whose clicking was loud in our ears
still

  grant ferson and i-we were silent there in the

room all motionless until grant spoke his voice was
metallic controlled mocking

  ferson and harker he was saying ferson and
harker who believed in my theory my power it seems
when none else on earth did who made projectors like
the one that i wear and have escaped the world doom
that i have released have escaped and have come in
search of me with pistols in their hands even

  my brain was racing i knew that to lift the arms
in our grasp meant instant death grants sardonic mirth
lashed suddenly out in scorn

  to come through the city toward this building firing
shots he mocked shots that made those brute-
swarms beneath us flee but that warned me at the same
time of your coming to steal clumsily in upon me
that way thinking to surprise me and halt the work thats
not yet finished 

  that work has gone on too long grant said ferson
slowly his voice strange it cannot go on longer

  cannot came the bitter voice you mistake fer-
son-it must and shall what are they now but brutes
animals the world of men that derided and refused my
work that might have transformed them into gods
brutes and even more brutal shall they become going
down through form after form to the first protoplasm

they asked for proof- have given the world proof

have thrown back humanity eons on the road of progress
and i will throw them and all earths life back farther

still this great projector-it is worth the months it

took to build it-months that i toiled here and posed as
a scientist studying electrical phenomena working to
finish the projector at last and turn its great damping
vibration toward the sun in a mighty ray a vibration
tuned to neutralize and destroy that part of the suns
evolution vibrations radiating toward earth you have

lost ferson-harker for you both die this moment

and this projector shall continue to withhold the evolution
vibrations from earth until its life has been thrown back
in this world atavism into the primal protoplasm until
i alone am left living upon-

  has pistol roared for it was at that instant that ferson
world atavism



leaped but even the bullet could not halt fersons rush
so swift and unexpected was it and he struck grant
knocked him back i leaped toward the projector

  grants pistol was detonating even as he was knocked
back though and half-way to the machine something
seemed to strike me two swift smashing blows beneath
the shoulder i swayed staggered on to the projector
was beneath it and reaching toward the cables leading
into it grant was springing toward me his pistol at
my head but behind him ferson blood on his lips and
on his breast half-raised himself the pistol in his hand
speaking at its crack grant swayed collapsed and
fell the black compact case at his belt that had pre-
served him breaking loose as he struck the floor

  ferson leaning had his dimming eyes upon me striv-
ing to speak i reached grasped the cables tore at
them once twice and then they had ripped loose the
white light of the disk inside thegreat projector vanished
and the mechanism that moved it ceased its clicking
the world atavism that had thrown the races of man
back to the state that had been theirs eons before was
ended at last ferson his eyes on mine seemed to
smile feebly in approval then his body slipped quietly
down and he lay as motionless and silent as grant

afterword

  i have been writing here in this silent room for a
  time whose length i cannot guess westward
  though the sun is touching the horizon its level
  rays searching through this room over the great pro-

jector and over ferson and grant lying silent before
me

  my life is ebbing swiftly from me with each pass-
ing minute yet with the age-old instinct of man strong
in me i have striven thus to leave a record of the great
change that men of the future in some far day may
read

  men of the future for there will be such there
must be such the upward surge of evolutionary
progress that has been interrupted set back here on
earth begins again its slow upward climb with the halt-
ing of this projector the coming again of the evolution
vibrations that are now playing on earth again be-
neath me in the silent city there swarm the ape-like
hordes that were once humanity but through the com-
ing ages they will climb up again through troglodyte
and savage barbarian to man

  and it is for those men of the far future that i have
written with my last strength these words as a record
and a warning that i shall enclose in the steel box beside
me

  a warning that their civilization be never cast
back from man to brute as ours has been and if god
send that they heed that warning none among them
ever shall die as i die now the last man of all men
looking down through the sunset into the familiar but
infinitely strange city where roam the hordes that once
were men sunset sunset for our civilization our
races as for the earth but dying i know that after
their passing there must come with the slow upward
climb of evolution new races new civilizations as surely
as after sunset and night must come the-

t tntil a sufficient number of gas masks had been manufactured during the
latter part of the world war numberless combatants and non-coynbatants
were incapacitated and made life-long invalids by the introduction of the life-
destroying gases which some all too clever chemists had supplied also there was
a great amount of wholesale injury to vast areas of land and even to life-all of

illustrated by morey

gradually the hum of the huge nashky
generators which were sending a protective
field of pure force unassociated with matter
over the island of st helena died down
to a mere murmur of sound and then was
silent from far overhead a siren wailed and two trans-
port aerostats dropped slowly and gracefully toward
the little landing field which had been built for them
when the allied nations of the world had chosen st
helena as a place of exile for the defeated rulers of
the now defunct russian union of soviet republics
for ten long years the captives had remained on the
island which had been isolated and rendered unapproach-
able by the rest of the world by the utilization of the
very forces by which nashky one of the council of
seven which had ruled russia had almost imposed the
rule of his group on the world during this period
but two of the captives had left the island

  one of them was feodor balinsky the greatest living
serumologist and physiological chemist and at one time
the arch-enemy of mankind balinsky had been captured
with the rest of the russian leaders and had narrowly
escaped execution for his share in the gigantic crimes
which russia had perpetrated before his trial however
he was examined at the request of ilga vestoff by doctor
von helmer the great swiss surgeon von helmer has
unhesitatingly pronounced balinsky as suffering from
dementia caused by a blood clot in his brain and curable
by operative measures he operated successfully and
feodor balinsky overtaken by remorse had meditated
suicide the influence of ilga vestoff had prevented
him from doing so and had turned his mighty genius
back into the paths it had trodden before his mind be-
came affected and from his island prison had come a
dozen serums of almost inestimable value to the medical
profession in their age-old fight against disease the
fact that ilga vestoff who stood in the eyes of the

world for all that was noble and courageous had married
balinsky and shared his exile had turned the tide in his
favor and the results of his work had done the balance
after seven years of imprisonment he was released
and had since risen to high honors as a result of the
labors of himself and his assistants in the huge research
laboratory established for him at pole mountain
wyoming

  the other to leave was nashky himself ivan nashky-
had been the victim of no disease and the fact that
nashky generators were used to guard st helena was
no evidence of active co-operation on his part the
man proved to have a colossal brain and not even the
genius of general hamilton was able to unravel from the
mazes of data dragged from it under the influence of
hypnotic anesthesia the secrets underlying his invention
faced with the alternative of execution for his crimes or-
building enough of his generators to render st helena
impregnable against attack nashky had capitulated and
had built them and had taught american engineers the
methods of their operation but no one save himself
understood their construction they had proven won-
derfully efficient and had needed no repairs since their
erection

  nashky had not used all of the tools and materials
furnished him in fabricating the twelve generators as
the world soon learned scarcely had they been in opera-
tion for a month before one evening a guard saw a
small rectangular block of dark substance rising from
the ground in the vicinity of the shops where nashky
had done his work the guard had given an alarm and
the batteries installed on the island had poured a rain
of radite shells toward the strange aircraft but without
result an immediate check of the prisoners was made
and it was found that ivan nashky had made good his
escape the aerial patrols of the entire world had been
at once notified on the general broadcast wavelength

but from the moment that his ship had disappeared in the
rapidly darkening sky no trace of either him or his
craft had ever been obtained

  he had done good work on his generators before his
escape and it was soon found that he had constructed
the minimum number that would serve to fully safe-
guard the island of exile general hamilton chief
signal officer of the united states had spent many
hours in measuring the output of the machines and had
finally rendered an opinion that were one of them to
be put out of operation and disassembled for study
the island would be imperfectly guarded despite his
report an attempt was made to cut one of them out
of the circuit but it was found that nashky had done
his work so cleverly that any attempt to disconnect one
machine made it impossible to start the balance the
world was therefore forced to forego the mechanical
advantage which the knowledge of their construction
would entail and allow them to remain where their in-
ventor had set them up running continuously day and
night except for the one hour a month when they were
shut down in order to allow supplies to be landed for the
use of the prisoners and of the garrison

  slowly the two transport aerostats dropped to the
ground and a detail came from the warehouses to unload
them hardly had the crews debarked from the ships
before the dull boom of an alarm gun sounded on
the still air

  the commandant in his office located in the main
lookout tower pressed the button of his communicator
and spoke sharply into it

   a strange aircraft right above us sir at about sixty
thousand and descending rapidly reported the sentry

  damn it man warn them off shouted the com-
mandant no ships are allowed closer than two hun-
dred miles while the generators are shut down

  i did warn them on the general wavelength replied
the sentry but they are still approaching

  the commandant took a pair of binoculars from the
drawer of his desk and stepped to the window he was
an old grizzled man with the single stars of a brigadier
general on his shoulders and the front of his blouse
blazed with bits of colored ribbon prominent among
which was the sombre black edged with crimson which
marked him as a veteran of the terrible war with russia
a decade before he raised the glasses to his eyes and
stared and his face paled momentarily

  judas priest he murmured

  for a moment he was frozen into immobility but a
lifetime of training to meet emergencies came to his
rescue and he dashed to his communicator knocking
over a chair which stood in the way

  man all batteries he shouted align the guns on
that approaching craft as soon as it is within range but
dont fire until i give the word start the generators
at twice

the island became a scene of bustle and hurry
grim-faced artillerymen broke open caissons and
with electric loaders sent home huge sixteen and eigh-
teen-inch radite shells into the hungry maws of the
antiaircraft rifles while the observers and gun pointers
in the battery-command stations trained the huge guns
on the oncoming craft now barely thirty thousand feet
above them gun after gun was served and battery
commander after battery commander reported his piece
in readiness for firing and aligned on the target

  the commandant was again at the window staring
at the approaching craft as it came nearer he could
see emblazoned on the hull the sombre colors of the
insignia of the long defunct russian union of soviet
republics

  nashky he muttered to himself why the devil
didnt they install a hamilton generator or two here
these guns will be of no use if he has the same type
of craft as he escaped in

  with a final glance at the stranger he moved to his
desk and locked in the button of his communicator

   all batteries fire he cried

  with a roar that shook the ground the batteries turned
loose their three and five thousand pound projectiles
the aim of many of them was perfect and the stranger
disappeared in a smother of smoke and flame from the
bursting radite shells gradually the smoke was dis-
sipated and the craft could be seen moving slowly but
steadily toward the island

  keep up the fire  cried the commandant what is
the matter with those generators

  the roar of heavy guns shook the lookout tower
but the welcome hum of nashky generators did not make
itself heard

  why the devil dont you start those generators
stormed the commandant into his communicator

  they wont start sir came a report at last there
is some kind of an interference wave that throws them
out of phase every time we try to get them into
synchronism

  the commandant swore and hastened back to his
window the stranger was only about three thousand
feet above the island now and was slowly maneuvering
about gradually getting into the position he wanted
presently a puff of smoke came from the hull above
with a gasp the commandant watched the nearest bat-
tery the shell fired from nashkys craft was a small
one but the havoc it wrought was frightful it fell
within a hundred feet of one of the eighteen-inch rifles
which were firing and the huge tube suddenly wilted
and fell forward as though it were tallow before a fire
the commandant rubbed his eyes and looked again

  what happened to that gun  he cried

  there was no answer to his question and he trained
his glass on the rifle there was no doubt that it had
drooped forward as though it were made of lead and
even as he watched the barbette carriage crumpled into
a shapeless mass and all that was left of the glittering
steel was a huge amorphous mass spreading slowly over
the ground scattered here and there on the ground
were shapeless splotches of color which had been the
gun crew a few moments before

  again the gun spoke from nashkys ship and another
rifle near the first began to wilt down while the crew
collapsed as though smitten with lightning a voice
speaking english with a decided accent sounded from
the commandants communicator

  good evening general it said i presume that by
now you are aware who i am in case you are more
than usually dull this evening i will tell you that i
am the admiral of the air fleet of the world union of
soviet republics i trust that you are enjoying watching
the effects of solvite my latest contribution to the science
of warfare since you may have missed some of the
finer points of the demonstration i will now fire again
and demolish a few more of the rifles which you have
fcegt so many men busy polishing for the last ten years
the last war



you will observe in a few shots the advantages of this
new explosive over the radite with which you are
familiar i beg you to keep close watch for i am about
to fire again

  the antiaircraft batteries which had been silent for a
few moments resumed their ground-shaking thunder but
through the sound locater which he had trained on
nashkys craft the commandant could hear the bark
of the small rifle with which it was armed he looked
toward the batteries and watched another huge rifle
suffer the fate which had overtaken the first two and
saw the crew collapse into immobility as the effects
of the explosion reached them again nashky fired and
another gun and its crew went out of commission huge
radite shells were bursting continuously around the
attacking ship but it suffered no harm from them

  cease firing shouted the commandant into his
communicator all crews leave their guns and take
refuge in gasproof casements keep trying to start those
generators

  you have shown real wisdom in your orders gen-
eral came nashkys mocking voice unfortunately
gasproof casements will not in the least protect your
personnel any more than firing at me will protect your
material however i am not in the least interested in
wiping out the garrison of st helena-at least not
at this time the real objects of my trip are two one
is to rescue the prisoners whom you hold here who are
men whom i know and trust and whom i can depend
on the other is to compass the destruction of the gene-
rators which i was forced to construct and install during
the period of my enforced sojourn as your guest i
presume that i am safe in assuming that you are sur-
rendering without terms 

  we will never surrender stormed the commandant

  how sad cried nashky in a mocking voice i
regret that you force me to take extreme measures
toward your unfortunate garrison i believe if my
memory serves me right that the gasproof casement for
battery vestoff is close behind the west gun i will
now drop a solvite shell into it

  the gun of nashkys ship spoke again and to his
horror the commandant saw the heavy concrete of the
gasproof casement sag and fall inward in a shapeless
mass it was evident without further inquiry that none
of the gun crew could have survived the shot

  is the demonstration sufficient or shall i fire again
inquired nashky i have several thousand shells on
board and i will gladly spend a couple of dozen in
wiping out your garrison if such extreme measures are
needed to convince you of the futility of further re-
sistance

  the commandant hung his head and groaned aloud
in anguish

  dont take it so hard general went on nashky
remember that better men than you have surrendered
to me in the past believe me i speak truly when i
tell you that immediate and unconditional surrender is
the only means you have of sparing your command a
peculiarly unpleasant death i dont wish to rush your
decision and so i will give you thirty seconds in which
to decide before i start firing again

  the commandant groaned again

  what are your terms he asked sadly

  thats better general they are very simple all
of the prisoners whom you hold are to be at once released
and conducted to the two transport aerostats on your

landing field and allowed to embark they will be fur-
nished with arms and the regular engineering crews of
the transports will man the ships but they will be
unarmed as soon as the embarkation is complete your
men will be allowed to gather in the vicinity of the
landing field and remain in the open they will not
be harmed but i will destroy your antiaircraft rifles and
your nashky generators before the transports take the
air the temptation to fire on them might be greater
than some of your gunners could withstand and i do
not care to have any of my countrymen lose their lives
since you will no longer have prisoners you will no
longer have any use for the generators and frankly
i dont care to have hamilton start pawing them over and
pulling them apart

  i will give up the prisoners to you since i have to
but i will not deliver any of the crews of the transports
to your mercy cried the commandant

  as you will general you have heard my terms
which admit of no deviation either they are accepted
at once or i shall start firing and if i start i will not
cease until i have completed the destruction of every
member of the garrison

  i will accept your terms muttered the commandant

  i congratulate you on your judgment general one
other slight thing i require your word of honor that
the terms of the surrender will be strictly and honorably
observed and i will expect you to personally inspect the
transport crews and assure yourself that they are
unarmed

  i give you my word of honor replied the com-
mandant

  that is satisfactory general i will hover over the
field until you inform me that the terms of the surrender
have been carried out and that the transports are ready
to rise and that your garrison are gathered at the landing
field please caution all of your men not to go near the
areas where my shells have landed as their effect is
singularly permanent

general hunter left his office with a bowed head
and stepped into the conveyor that stood without
and was whisked away to the dormitory where the rus-
sian prisoners were quartered his chief of staff met
him on the way and the commandant explained the
situation in a few words

  there is no use in sacrificing everyone van nuys
he said the devil has the whip hand over us and all
that we can do is to dance to the tune he whistles

  you will be court-martialed sir exclaimed the
chief of staff

  possibly i will van nuys but even so i would
rather be cashiered with a clear conscience than to know
that my pig-headed obstinacy had meant the death of
my entire command tell wilson to release the prisoners
and arm them have the engineering crews of the trans-
ports mustered before me on the landing field

  colonel van nuys saluted and hastened away and
general hunter turned his conveyer toward the landing
field as he reached it and stepped out of the car a
man approached and saluted

  sir may i speak to you  he asked

  what is it captain hamilton asked the com-
mandant i know that you couldnt start your genera-
tors

  there was a powerful interference wave that threw
them out of phase sir or nashky could never have


amazing

stories

landed a shell on the island it didnt interfere with my
communicator though and i heard all that passed between
you and him i have a favor to ask of you sir
what is it

  the chief engineer of the chico did not come on this
trip and it is one man short in the crew i am a com-
petent engineer and i would like your permission to
jo in her as the missing chief engineer i can disguise
myself so that no one will know me and i may be able
to do some good

  they will probably kill you hamilton

  ill take that chance sir my brother won a tilt with
nashky ten years ago and i would like to try the hamil-
ton luck against him again

  your brother are you related to general robert
hamilton the inventor of the hamilton generator
yes sir he is my brother he was a major when
he trimmed nashkys wings and he was made a general
on the strength of it promotion is darned slow now-
adays and id like to try my luck

  if you are general hamiltons brother i can see
nothing to do but to let you have your way captain
go ahead and get into a uniform and hurry for the
transport crews will be mustered here in a few minutes
no weapons mind i have given my word on that

  i will be unarmed general thank you very much
sir replied the captain as he hurried away

  a tramping of feet was heard and the russian prison-
ers arrived guarded by a detachment of the garrison
the officer of the day stepped up to the general and
reported the prisoners as all present including one who
had been brought from the infirmary on a stretcher

  have they been armed lieutenant asked general
hunter

  not yet sir i have arms for them here but i waited
for your personal confirmation of colonel van nuys
orders before issuing them out

  arm them said the commandant tersely

  the officer of the day saluted and issued orders to
his guard in a few moments the prisoners were armed
and were marching toward the transports to board them
one of the prisoners stopped behind for a moment to
speak to the commandant as he approached the
general looked up and recognized zaneff the ex-
premier of russia

  what is it zaneff  he asked wearily

  general hunter for some time i have known that
this day was coming and i am greatly relieved to find
that you have come through it unharmed for ten years
you have been my jailer and your kindness and courtesy
have been unfailing under the most trying circumstances
i wish to thank you both for myself and for my fellow-
prisoners for the many favors you have done for us and
to extend to you our hearty wishes that the court of
inquiry which will sit on the matter will completely ex-
onerate you we will be very glad to prepare a statement
if it would help your case any

  tears showed in general hunters eyes

  thank you zaneff he said simply there is
nothing that you can do for me in the matter your
testimony would only be a repetition of what i will say
myself and i believe that my word will not be doubted
thank you and convey my thanks to your comrades for
their thoughtfulness good-bye

  zaneff wrung the general heartily by the hand and
hastened toward the waiting chico colonel van nuys

stepped up and reported that the engineering crews of
the chico and the kenowis had been mustered as gen-
eral hunter turned to inspect them the chief of staff
leaned forward and spoke earnestly into his ear

  general he muttered there is something funny

going on one of the crew of the chico-

  yes i know colonel interrupted the commandant
it is by my authority and with my permission

  colonel van nuys saluted and stepped back and gen-
eral hunter carefully inspected the assembled engineers
and confiscated a pistol the only arm he found at his
order the crews repaired to their respective ships and
boarded them and secured the doors

 colonel van nuys order the entire garrison and all
civilians to assemble here at the landing field everyone
is to come for nashky will bombard the island as soon
as all have assembled

  half an hour later general hunter stepped to the com-
municator in the warehouse office and informed nashky
that the terms of surrender had been complied with

  very well general replied nashky what will
follow during the next half hour will be a sight that is
new to the world because i wish to have it accurately
reported by trained observers i will ask that you colonel
van nuys and captain hamilton your engineering of-
ficer go to the lookout tower and observe it you will
not be harmed notify me when you have arrived
general hunter paled slightly but he stepped out and
summoned colonel van nuys and a captain of artillery
who bore a slight resemblance in personal appearance to
the missing hamilton and with them proceeded to the
lookout tower as he informed nashky of his where-
abouts the huge craft above him started to move

  nashky had been right when he said that the sight
would be unique from the hull of the russian craft a
small gun spoke from time to time and each time a shell
fell in the vicinity of one of the guarding antiaircraft
rifles of the island and each time the gun melted as though
it were tallow before a fire and both gun and carriage
spread out over the ground in a huge shapeless mass
when the guns had been disposed of nashky turned his
attention to the huge generators which had guarded the
island far more effectively than the guns had there
were twelve of the generators and twelve shells were
fired and the machine lost form and became huge black
and gold stains on the ground when the destruction
of the defenses was complete nashky spoke again

  my mission has been accomplished general and i
will take my fellow-countrymen away from your care
kindly report to the military and naval heads of the
world what you have witnessed without exaggeration
and without suppressing any of the details i would ad-
vise you to stay away from the vicinity of the spots
where the shells landed if you value your life before i
leave your vicinity i will make one more stipulation
you will not use your general wavelength communica-
tors nor attempt to give any other form of alarm for the
space of three hours after my departure nor allow it to
be done will you promise this

  i will promise nothing more stormed the com-
mandant

  your failure to promise will result in the destruction
of all buildings on the island for i am not sure of the
location of all of the communicators this will leave
your sick without a hospital and all of you without food
or means of asking for aid for some time and would ac-
the last war



complish nothing in the end for i would have more than
the three hours of start which i am stipulating i will
give you one minute in which to make up your mind
you have the whip hand today nashky cried the
commandant i will promise for i have no choice
i will live for only one thing the day when i see you
hanged higher than haman

  when that day arrives general i will cordially in-
vite you to be present said nashky with a laugh if
you will now look out of your window you will be able
to wave a last farewell to your prisoners before they
leave

  general hunter glanced at his watch as the chico
and the kenowis rose from the landing field the little
fleet of vessels moved off to the northeast at an elevation
of twelve thousand feet the huge russian craft rising
far above them until it was out of sight even to his field
glasses

  what time is it he demanded sharply

  two hours and forty-two minutes before we can
give an alarm sir replied colonel van nuys you
had better lie down for a few minutes general you
look fagged ill see that you are at the communicator
teady to send out an alarm as soon as the time limit has
expired

ttere they come cried colonel van nuys

  a x general hunter stepped to the window and
looked up a hundred tiny scouting aerostats spotted
the sky in all directions serving as a screen for the
fleet of heavier craft which formed the first line of de-
fense for the oncoming fleet the cruisers swung over
the island and took up position grim and stationary
surrounding the flagship from whose peak streamed the
colors of the chief of staff of the united states it
was an inspiring sight and one which thrilled the old
warrior to the bottom of his heart he straightened up
for a moment his hand at the salute but a cloud passed
over his brow and he seemed to slump suddenly

  they make a wonderful show dont they general 
said colonel van nuys

  show yes they do replied the general bitterly
but that is all they are-a show-a vain show nashky
could destroy them all in an hour with his one ship and
do it without danger to himself there goes the com-
municator tell them to drop to the center of the land-
ing field ill go to meet them

  directed by colonel van nuys the flagship of the
american fleet dropped gracefully to a landing and
general munroe chief of staff of the united states
stepped out and acknowledged the salute of general
hunter

  hello hunter he said cheerfully as he stepped
forward and shook hands with the commandant so
your birds have flown have they 

  without answering general hunter unhooked his
sabre and handed it to general munroe the chief of
staff took it with an air of surprise

whats this hunter he asked as he examined the
weapon closely has this some bearing on the escape 
it is my sabre sir replied general hunter i have
failed in my command and i am tendering it voluntarily
rather than have you ask me for it

  general munroe turned on his subordinate sharply
dont be an ass hunter he said when i want
your sabre ill ask for it and not before buck up
man he went on kindly no one blames you for the

escape i know your record well enough to stake my
commission that you did all that human ingenuity could
do to foil it no one can fight that devil nashky come
along well go up to the lookout tower and see what
happened tell us about it as we go you know hamil-
ton dont you hunter

  the commandant shook hands with the famous in-
ventor of the hamilton generator which had been instru-
mental in bringing about the downfall of nashky and
his cohorts a decade earlier

  did nashky take any one with him except the pris-
oners  asked general munroe as the party made their
way toward the lookout tower

  he took the engineering crews of both the chico and
the kenowis with him as prisoners in addition un-
known to himself he took along captain hamilton my
engineering officer who disguised himself as the chief
engineer of the chico and went along unsuspected
my brother  asked general hamilton

  yes sir i had not known of the relationship before
but he told me when he asked to go in order to win a
tilt against nashky as he put it

  charley is a clever boy replied general hamilton
he may be able to do some good at any rate he can
only die and if so hell die in a good cause

  he took no other prisoners  asked general munroe
  no sir

  i beg your pardon general interrupted colonel
van nuys there was one other whom you are neg-
lecting to mention

  what do you mean van nuys the ones whom i
have named are the only ones that i know of

  your daughter sir

jane what do you mean man are you crazy
no sir i tried to tell you at the time that one of the
chico crew was not what he seemed and you told me
that it was by your authority and with your permission
i meant captain hamilton idiot

  i was not aware that he was going the one i was
referring to was your daughter who slipped into the
chico in the dress of an oiler before the prisoners em-
barked

  van nuys are you sure of what you are saying

  i am positive sir steady general i

  general hunter had swayed momentarily but he re-
covered himself and with a face as expressionless as a
block of granite he led the way to the lookout tower

  what the devil  cried general munroe as he looked
out from the tower and saw the shapeless blobs which
had been antiaircraft rifles at the time of his last visit
hamilton what do you make of it 

  general hamilton surveyed the scene thoughtfully
through a pair of field glasses for several minutes before
he spoke and when he did it was in the form of a ques-
tion to general hunter

  what did nashky call the stuff he used he asked
  solvite

  the name is suggestive to say the least it looks as
though some powerful solvent had been poured over
those guns and generators with your permission gen-
eral i am going down to those guns and take a look-see
nashky warned me to keep away from the spots
where the shells landed said general hunter

  all the same this has to be investigated im going
down there

  no youre not hamilton said general munroe
sharply we cant afford to risk you no one will go


amazing stories

there for the present ill send for the chief of the
chemical warfare service and have him bring a crew
equipped for gas work and let them do the exploring
they are experts at it and you and i are not get busy
on the communicator and find out whether any trace has
been reported of the chico or the kenowis 

  general hamilton stepped to the communicator but
there was no information forthcoming so far as could
be told from reports from aerial patrols and commercial
liners all over the world the fleet commandeered by
nashky had dropped out of sight no one had seen
any such craft but in view of the fact that the air lines
were as well mapped out as the ocean routes had been a
half century earlier this was not surprising all that
nashky had to do was to go between the regular traffic
lanes and he could have kept out of sight for months

  well there seems to be nothing more that we can do
here said general munroe when he had heard the re-
port the president is calling a conference of the
military heads of the nations which allied to fight russia
before at honolulu and we might as well get along in
that direction hunter let van nuys take command
here and you come with us your description of the
attack will be vital van nuys when general gilmore
gets here turn everything over to him and cooperate in
every way possible he will have a crew equipped for
gas work and he will examine the places where the shells
fell and take samples in the meanwhile let no one ap-
proach them come gentlemen let us start

the flagship rose from the landing field and headed
toward honolulu closely flanked on each side by
four huge aerostats which carried on their upper decks
long tubes projecting forward and back to each side
and directly upward while from the pierced bottoms of
the hulls other of the sinister tubes projected general
munroe looked at them and sighed

  i wish that we had a thousand of those generator
carriers he said to general hamilton they are the
only ships in the fleet that are worth anything when it
comes to attacking nashky in the kind of a craft that he
has there is one good thing about the matter though
nashkys ship is not equipped for much offensive work
aside from bomb dropping

  his old ones were not replied hamilton but no
offense other than bomb dropping was needed at that
time i rather expect that his present ship will surprise
us by its offensive power remember those rifles on
st helena

  so far as gun fire goes i am not afraid of a hundred
of his craft replied munroe we can certainly out-
fight him and hold him up long enough to get one of
your generators bearing on his craft and that is the end
of the battle

  i hope so

  what are you talking about hamilton it took you
less than ten minutes to down four of them ten years
ago

  that is true general but remember that the hamil-
ton generator was as big a surprise to nashky as the
nashky aircraft was to us now he is forewarned and
i have no doubt that he has prepared a defense against
them it is nine years since he escaped and no one
knows what a brain of the power of his may not have
evolved during that period

  you zre unduly pessimistic hamilton i will admit
that nashky is a genius but there are limits to his

power even he cannot do the impossible at any
rate i would like nothing better than to have his ship
show up right now

  the communications officer of the flagship hastened
up and saluted

  a scout has reported the presence of a strange craft
of unknown design and flying no colors straight ahead
sir he reported it is at an altitude of about thirty
thousand feet and is descending rapidly and heading
toward the fleet the scout requests instructions
general munroe hastened to the signal room of the
flagship and received in person a confirmation of the
scouts report before the excited lieutenant could give
the details of the appearance of the stranger other but-
tons in the signal room began to glow and a dozen other
scouts were repeating the information a cruiser was
ordered forward to investigate

  the commander of the cruiser was a veteran of the
last war with russia and as soon as he arrived within
sight of the strange craft he reported it as being of the
same type as those which nashky had launched against
the wprld a decade before

  now i am converted to a belief in santa claus
cried general munroe as he slapped general hamilton
on the back what could be sweeter the old fox has
run his head into a steel trap this time he must think
that we have no hamilton generators with us

  i am not so sure of that replied hamilton du-
biously

  oh quit your croaking just wait and see the fun
this scrap will be over before it is well started

  he turned to the communications officer

  order all scouts to attack at close range they wont
do any good but theyll keep him busy while the gen-
erator carriers slip up on him as soon as the scouts
attack the cruisers will approach and go into action with
smoke-shell to hide the approach of the generator car-
riers this ship will take elevation to thirty thousand
and watch the fun

  the flagship rose above the balance of the fleet and
hovered at an elevation of six miles two miles lower
the cruisers swung into battle formation and headed
west the flagship followed above and slightly behind
the main fleet presently a dark spot made its appear-
ance ahead as the fleet advanced the spot was resolved
into a craft even larger than the flagship surrounded by
a cloud of what looked like tiny insects the little
scouts darted in and out weaving continuously and
keeping up a hail of machine gun bullets and thirty-
seven millimeter radite shells toward the larger mass
but it ignored its attackers as a whale would have ig-
nored the attack of a school of minnows

  that is a nashky ship all right exclaimed munroe
six propellers and no elevating fans wait until the
cruisers get into action and then youll see some fun

  even as he spoke the cruiser column arrived within
range and swinging sharply to the left began to pour
broadsides of six- and eight-inch shells toward their
quarry in a moment nashkys ship was hidden from
view in a smother of smoke and flaming radite and the
scouts their mission accomplished drew off and left
the battle to the heavier craft

  he cant see through that haze exulted munroe
look hamilton there go the generator carriers now
watch her come tumbling down

  two of the huge generator carriers moved off to each
side of the nashky ship and stole toward the cloud of
the last war



nashky craft occupying the center of
the scene the four generator carriers
closing rapidly in their projector tubes
trained on their opponent while the
engineers rapidly ran their generators
up and down the frequency scale try-
ing to hit the key note of the primary
generators of the nashky craft to
those who had watched the great battle
over the north atlantic ten years before
where four such craft had been hurled
to destruction in a few minutes the re-
sult seemed inevitable

 nearer and nearer approached the
generator carriers and general munroe
strained his ears in an attempt to hear
the tell tale momentary silence from the
nashky craft that would show that one
of the attacking generators was tuned
correctly

    theyll get him in a minute he
     cried

       general hamilton beside him
       watched intently but while
       munroes expression was
       one of supreme confi-

the generator carrier was
falling not only was it
falling but it was also
losing form and identity
and was slowly turning into
a shapeless black blob of
substance   

smoke and radite munroe clamped
a sound locator on his head and
watched the approach

  theyre closing up on him he
cried now they are starting their gen-
erators good head work hamilton each
one is running on a different frequency
now they are training their projectors
there they go

  the fire from the cruisers abruptly ceased
and the four generator carriers dashed to-
ward the stranger the smoke subsided
and the five ships were plainly visible the

stories

dence hamiltons brow was distinctly clouded with
worry the attacking ships approached until only a
thousand yards separated them from their quarry before
any signs of offensive action came from the giant
nashky suddenly a puff of smoke came from the hull
of the sombre craft and a small shell was seen to burst
against the tough armor plate skin of the leading genera-
tor carrier

  hell have to use heavier metal than that if he hopes
to do any damage exulted general munroe

  general hamilton made no reply but the lines of
worry in his face grew deeper

  good god he exclaimed munroe do you see that

  it cant be true cried the chief of staff

  he rubbed his eyes and looked again the generator
carrier was falling not only was it falling but it was
also losing form and identity and was slowly turning into
a shapeless black blob of substance which was gradually
assuming a spherical shape as it plunged toward the sea
below general hamilton leaped to the communicator

  all ships fire i he shouted smoke if you have it
or radite or anything handy but fire blind him before
he can fire again

  a bustle of activity arose in the cruisers but hamil-
tons orders had come too late before a shell was
fired by the american fleet the gun on the nashky had
fired three more times and the american fleets genera-
tor carriers were wrecked down into the atlantic they
plunged to destruction

the cruisers were firing now and the russian ship
was hidden from view in a cloud of smoke and flam-
ing radite but it was no longer passive forward through
the cloud it relentlessly pressed as it came momen-
tarily out of the smoke a gun spoke from it again and
the american fleet was left to mourn one of its finest
cruisers not daunted by the fate of their comrades
the american cruisers attacked with fury but time and
again the single gun of the nashky sent forth a mes-
sage of death and destruction and ship after ship lost
form and plunged an amorphous mass into the hungry
sea below

  with a dozen of his finest cruisers and all of his
generator carriers gone there was but one thing left for
general munroe to do and he did it he ordered a gen-
eral retreat in orderly lines the american fleet drew
sullenly off and then the real supremacy of the nashky
ship became evident forward it charged at a speed
greater than could be attained by any but the fastest
scouts of the americans no longer was it firing only
one gun from a dozen portholes came puffs of smoke
and the gunnery was deadly in its accuracy ship after
ship took the last fatal plunge into oblivion the ameri-
cans tried to fly they broke up into a dozen detachments
but the relentless fire of the nashky followed them and
it was not until the last of the cruisers which made up
the backbone of the finest air fleet in the world had been
destroyed that the firing ceased aside from a few
scouts which were splitting the air at maximum speed
away from the scene of the conflict the air was clear ex-
cept for the flagship and the ominous nashky the
black craft rose and approached the flagship and the
navigating officer looked toward general munroe for
orders

  stay where you are he said bitterly there is no
use in trying to run or to fight lets take our medicine
like men

  nearer and nearer came the ominous craft until the
emblem of the long dead russian union of soviet re-
publics could be plainly seen on its hull the button
on the flagships communicator began to glow and the
communications officer switched his receiver to an
audiator in order that all could hear a smooth oily
voice speaking english with a noticeable accent filled
the cabin

  good afternoon general munroe it said ah yes
there is my old friend general hamilton how do you
do hamilton and how are you general hunter i
havent seen you for some time all of my old friends
seem to be assembled here to greet me i am sorry to
think that van hornung didnt live to see this day he
would have enjoyed watching the most one-sided aerial
engagement ever fought it was too bad that your gen-
erators couldnt get on my primary wavelength hamil-
ton but alas science makes discoveries and the world
progresses i am afraid that you will have to class your
epoch-making discovery as obsolete have any of you
gentlemen anything to say to me 

  yes ivan nashky i have replied general munroe

  admiral nashky if you please general

  admiral nashky then damn your impudence i have
something to say to you you have defeated one of our
fleets with your damnable inventions but there are a
dozen more fleets left and we have men who are just as
good scientists as you are you may triumph for a
while but you are doomed in the end now go ahead
and fire on us and dont taunt us any longer in our
helplessness

  my dear general i have no intention of firing on
you i would not think of injuring my old friends-
yet your testimony before the conference which will
assemble in honolulu is exactly what i need to let the
world realize just how helpless it is before me i merely
gave you a lesson in the power of my latest craft be-
sides i wish you to carry a message from me to the
council

  why dont you give it direct interposed general
hamilton

  because my dear hamilton it tickles my fancy to
think that the chief of staff of the united states is re-
duced to the position of my messenger boy

  what are your terms  asked general munroe

  my terms general are simplicity itself i will ac-
cept no surrender of any kind i trust no one least of
all the russian people who turned on me in my adversity
the race of men has gone to seed and it is my intention
to destroy all human life on the planet with the excep-
tion of my own and the few friends from st helena
and elsewhere who have assembled under my protection
this is the message which i wish you to take to the
world

  you have already seen in a small way the effects of
solvite b this substance comes in two allotropic
modifications one of which has a purely local effect and
which does not attack the atmosphere except in the im-
mediate vicinity of a burst i have another and more
powerful form solvite a which i intend to use shortly
this modification will not only affect solids as you have
seen solvite b do but it also affects the atmosphere in
such a way as to make it transmit the disintegrating ef-
fect of the burst to anything with which it comes in
contact its action furthermore while not affected by
wind is progressive and extensive were i to fire one
shell loaded with it now in two years not a living being
the last war



except those whom i chose to protect would remain
alive my plan however is to fire one or more shells a
day m various parts of the world and enjoy the amusing
spectacle of mankind flying from place to place with the
spectre of death stalking always behind them and know-
ing that their flight is after all useless and will lead
them but to the grave

  the man is crazy ejaculated general munroe

  possibly i am general but if so realize that i am a
madman equipped with such power as the world has
never known and that i have made no threats which i
am not in a position to carry out carry then this mes-
sage to the world that ivan nashky has weighed man-
kind in the balance and found them wanting and that the
word of their doom has been spoken now good day
i am returning to my base in order to prepare for the
slaughter which will start tomorrow

  the sombre black craft rose in the air until it was a
mere speck in the powerful telescopes with which the
flagship was equipped and then headed south at a greater
rate of speed than the maximum of the flagship when
it had disappeared general munroe gave the word and
the flagship resumed her interrupted trip toward
honolulu

a month had passed since ivan nashky had hurled
his insane threat of destruction to the world a
month of horror and death a month of vain striving to
combat the horrible plague which had been launched a
month of hopeless fighting and of heroism unparalleled
ivan nashky had made good his threat apparently
human life was doomed

  the council of the nations had met in gloom gen-
eral gilmore and his crew had visited st helena and had
tried vainly to secure samples of material from the
wrecked guns the most efficient gas protection which
had been developed proved to be worthless and man after
man of the crew died as they risked and gave their lives
in the attempts it was not even possible to recover
the bodies when daring men tried with long poles to
hook the bodies out the deadly infection ran up the
handles of the poles rendering them soft as putty and in
several cases where the men had not been able to drop
the poles and retreat in time they too were caught and
disintegrated into shapeless masses before the horrified
gaze of their comrades

  nor did this sad news alone account for the gloom
which pervaded the discussions nashky had not waited
long before putting his threats into operation the after-
noon of the first day of the council meeting his ship ap-
peared over london ships of the british royal air
force had sallied forth to do battle but were hurled to
the ground one by one in ruins three generator car-
riers had been among the attackers but their fate was no
different from that of the other ships when the de-
fenders had been cleared from the air a bomb was
dropped on london and the black craft departed

  television reproduced the scenes of horror in london
all over the world and the other cities saw huge buildings
topple and subside into shapeless masses of matter while
people dropped like flies and disintegrated where they
fell at first the destruction was purely local and
centered about the point where the bomb had landed but
it was soon observed to be spreading brave men sallied
close to the scene of the catastrophe and measured the
rate of spread it proved to be about twelve hundred and

fifty yards per hour about seventeen miles a day as it
would take nearly two years for the infection to cover
the world at that rate and as it was almost certain that
the virulence of the attack would decrease as the area
grew larger a momentary sense of relief was felt it
seemed certain that long before two years could pass
some means of combating the contagion would be found
the best scientists of the world were hurried off to
london to observe the phenomena they were unable
to go directly above the infected area for it soon became
evident that the infection was spreading in a hemispheri-
cal wave from the point of origin

  by the time the rate of progression and related data
had been obtained the black craft had appeared over
rome and ruthlessly destroying all aircraft which at-
tacked it had dropped another bomb and departed
fresh gloom spread over the world and as the days
went by a feeling of utter hopelessness and despondency
spread almost as rapidly as did the effects of the solvite
the black herald of death appeared from time to time
and dropped a single bomb and departed nor could any
man tell when the communicator buttons would glow and
nashkys taunting voice announce a new point of attack
and prophesy fresh horrors for suffering humanity

  every attempt to combat the black ship had been un-
successful and every effort to determine the cause of the
mysterious disintegration of matter under the influence
of solvite had been equally futile there was no start-
ing point from which to work and the time came when
the heads of such governments as were still functioning
ordered their flyers to cease from vain attacks and useless
sacrifice of men and ships and to keep their aerostats in
readiness to transport the population away from the
various points of attack for a time this method pre-
vented much loss of life but as the number of areas de-
void of life and incapable of supporting it increased
people became huddled together in the remaining safe
areas where they starved and sickened and died from
disease like flies pressed closer and closer together each
day by the encroaching areas of death and not knowing
at what moment nashkys ship would appear in the
heavens above and drop a bomb into the middle of the
narrowing strip of ground where they were huddled

  all of europe and australia and most of asia and the
americas had already been desolated while communica-
tions from africa had ceased and the air lanes were
closed by the mounting solvite the government of the
united states in common with those of the rest of the
world had ceased to function and the only semblance of
control over the actions of the people left alive was exer-
cised by a little group of scientists assembled at pole
mountain wyoming based upon the serumology labo-
ratory presided over by feodor balinsky for some un-
known reason possibly a spark of feeling for the man
who had so vitally aided him in his previous attempt to
conquer the world nashky had in his raids avoided the
vicinity of pole mountain again it may have been a
feeling of hatred for his old comrade in arms which led
him to spare him to the last and thus prolong his torture
whatever the cause the fact existed and there in the
heart of the wyoming country were gathered together
the greatest brains of the age and from there emanated
the few messages to which the remnant of mankind paid
heed and from there intrepid adventurers sallied forth
and gave their lives uselessly in trying out new methods
which they hoped would combat the plague


amazing

stories

  such was the situation when general hamilton who
was naturally one of the little group there assembled
received the message which spelled hope of continued
life and which might if they could get more time even
spell the ruin of nashkys terrible plan

the chico rose from the landing field at st helena
and soared to a height of twelve thousand feet be-
fore the navigator gave the orders which started the pro-
pellers and drove the ship toward the east at her maxi-
mum cruising speed of six hundred miles an hour cap-
tain hamilton in his assumed role of chief engineer
strode through the hull watching the small atomic engines
which drove both the propellers and the elevating fans
the crew of the chico knew their business and he found
nothing to criticize for a few minutes presently he
noticed one of the oilers oiling a commutator bearing
and he hastened over

  keep oil out of that commutator he snapped do
you want to wreck us 

  the oiler turned away with a mumbled word but
hamilton grasped him by the shoulder

  what do you mean by such conduct  he demanded
you knew better than to oil there and you know enough
to stand at attention and look at an officer when spoken
to look at me

  he whirled the oiler sharply around the man hung
his head but the captain twisted sharply on his shoulder
and with a grimace of pain the oiler looked up hamil-
ton released his grasp and stepped back

  good god he muttered in an undertone jane
hunter

the commandants daughter glanced swiftly around
dont give me away charley she whispered hastily
i am not ready to have my identity disclosed yet
how on earth did you get aboard he asked won-
deringly your father inspected the crews before we
embarked did he know that you were coming

  no he didnt i wasnt among the crews that were
inspected i heard nashkys orders to father and i
stole an oilers uniform and slipped into the chico before
the russians boarded it colonel van nuys saw me and
i was afraid that he would tell father but apparently he
didnt i had no idea that you were coming along and i
stowed away in the hope that i would be able to get some
information about their plans that might help

  you fool cried captain hamilton under his breath
you shouldnt have trusted your head in this lions
den they will show you no mercy this is no place
for a woman

  if ilga vestoff had argued that way ten years ago
we would have been dead or slaves to nashky today she
replied i may be of some help to you for i fancy that
your mission is the same as mine

  keep out of sight as much as possible muttered
hamilton go forward to the storeroom and stay
there until i send for you

  jane hunter straightened up and saluted as a russian
appeared in the doorway and hastened forward as hamil-
ton had directed

  hour after hour the chico drove on her way captain
hamilton had no access to the charts but an occasional
glance at the tachometer and repeater compass on the
engine room wall gave him the data on which to base a
rough idea of the course they were evidently avoiding
all of the regular traffic lanes and were cutting northeast
across africa toward the great unknown regions in the

heart of asia hoping to learn something of their desti-
nation he entered the control room and spoke to the
russian who was navigating the ship

  how long will we be aloft sir he asked

  the russian looked at him coldly

  why do you wish to know  he demanded

  our fuel supply is not overabundant and we are not
running at our most economical speed if we have a
very long trip before us it would be better to reduce
speed a couple of hundred miles an hour

  how many hours supply of fuel have you at this
speed 

  about twelve hours without touching the emergency
tanks

  and using them 

  five hours additional for the elevating fans alone
one hour and a half for the fans and the propellers at
this speed

  that will be sufficient

  over twelve hours but less than thirteen and a half
at six hundred miles an hour he reflected just about
where i thought the middle of the gobi desert well
he couldnt have chosen a better hiding place

  hour after hour the transports forged ahead the
regular fuel supply ran low and under hamiltons direc-
tions the emergency tanks were cut in a half hour
later the engine room communicator button glowed and
an order came from the control room to reduce to quarter
speed hamilton glanced out of a forward porthole
and a hundred miles ahead saw an atomic searchlight
blink and throw a beam straight up for an instant and
then vanish

  a blinking beacon he said to himself there is no
traffic lane or landing around here so it must mark our
destination

  his surmise was correct and forty-five minutes later
the transport was landed and a guard of russians ap-
peared at the door of the engine room and ordered the
crew to follow them as they stepped out on the
ground hamilton paused in amazement at the sight that
met his gaze they had landed in a range of mountains
which hamilton later decided were the alashans but at
the time he had no eyes for them standing alone in the
rugged scenery was a huge dome of silvery material
fully nine hundred yards in diameter and a hundred and
twenty yards high there was no sign of windows in the
dome but from the crest projected the end of an optical
instrument of some sort and on the ground level were
huge panels with smaller ones inset in them after the
manner of sliding doors

  another detachment of men moved up and hamilton
glanced around and saw that the kenowis had landed
beside them and that it was the crew of the sister trans-
port who had joined them the strange black craft which
had wrought the destruction at st helena stood near
by and hamilton marveled at the huge proportions of it
as he watched the large panels of the dome moved si-
lently back and he saw that they were indeed doors
the black craft was raised a few inches from the ground
and a number of men came from the interior of the dome
and started to tow it inside a glance showed him that
they were mongolians of the nomad tribes which in-
habited the gobi

  before his startled gaze the chico and the kenowis
moved and rose a few inches in the air although the
elevation fans were motionless he glanced down and
saw that each transport had been landed on a sheet of
the last war



silvery material which resembled the walls of the dome
other crews started to tow the two ships toward the
great dome he watched the performance for a moment
but a sharp command from the leader of the russians
started the prisoners toward the doorway of the dome
inside hamilton found that the entrance did not lead
into the dome itself but into a huge compartment made
of the same material as the dome and that a door similar
to the one through which he had made his way con-
fronted him the outer door slid shut and the inner
one opened and the prisoners marched through it into
the brilliantly lighted interior

  the dome had been erected over a huge stone building
fortress-like in its appearance surrounding the main
building were numerous skin tents of the common mon-
golian type and hamilton surmised that they were the
dwellings of the mongolians he had seen the prisoners
were marched into the stone building and to a large cen-
tral room where enthroned on a dais sat ivan nashky
the russian stared at them in silence for a few minutes
before he spoke

  i have declared war on the world he said abruptly
i have only a few followers and many of them are
savages excellent fighting men in their crude way but
not readily adaptable i can use a few good engineers
if you care to enlist in my service to fight against your
countrymen you may have the status of slaves if you
do not you will be killed what is your choice 

for a moment there was silence broken by the chief
engineer of the kenowis

  your fate might be made easier when you are finally
defeated if you held us as hostages he suggested of
course none of us will join you on any terms

  my final defeat laughed nashky it may interest
you to know that i have just returned from destroying
the eastern battle fleet of the united states which was
commanded by no less a person than general munroe
himself only one ship escaped destruction and i spared
it deliberately you have chosen your fate sir let the
others speak for themselves

  captain hamilton stepped forward

  i will throw in my lot with you gladly he said

  and so will i said jane as she stepped to his side

  and i added an engineer from the kenowis crew

  are there any others demanded nashky

  the chief engineer of the kenowis stepped forward
and spat deliberately in captain hamiltons face

  that is my answer to your treachery he snarled
i choose death

  without a word hamilton launched his fist toward the
face of his assailant the blow hit full on the chin and
the chief engineer staggered and went down as he
did so hamilton leaped forward and kicked him brutally
in the side

  take that as pay for the dogs life you led me while
i served under you he shouted and that and that 
he delivered other kicks at the prostrate figure

  nashky smiled approvingly

  well done he chuckled you are a man of the
true faith are there any others 

  there was no reply and nashky nodded toward a
group of mongolians who stood beside his dais ap-
parently as guards they stepped forward and seized
the luckless crew and marched them forth nashky
turned his attention to the group of three who remained

  you are content to remain as slaves he asked

  on any terms that give me a chance to strike a blow
at the tyrants who have so long oppressed me replied
hamilton

  jane and the engineer from the kenowis nodded
assent

  good exclaimed nashky rubbing his hands you
will be accepted on that status but if your performance
is equal to your talk you may be raised from that rank
and become freemen and my comrades in arms take
them to a cell for the present

  another group of guards stepped forward and led
the three to a small cell set in the recesses of the outer
wall of the building as the door crashed shut behind
them the engineer of the kenowis turned to hamilton

  that was well done captain hamilton he said
poor old owens it almost broke his heart to think that
a chief engineer would be a traitor

  who the devil are you demanded hamilton

  williams united states secret service replied the
engineer with a grin my errand is the same as yours
who is your partner

  hamilton shook hands warmly with the secret service
operative

  this is miss jane hunter general hunters daugh-
ter he said she stowed away on board in the hope
of becoming a second ilga vestoff

  she wont have much chance if her sex is dis-
covered replied williams as he shook hands with jane
nashky is a more cold-blooded fish than balinsky was
now captain what are your plans

  none until we see how the land lies the only thing
that we can do is to seem to enter heartily into nashkys
plans and hope that we can learn something worth com-
municating and find a chance of doing it i have been
on watch for fourteen hours so the first thing i need is
sleep if youll pardon me ill turn in for a little while
before they come to put us to work

  he threw himself down on one of the three cots with
which the cell was provided and almost instantly dropped
off to sleep his companions soon followed his example
and quiet reigned in the little cell

captain hamilton swung jane hunter behind
him and fired his heavy automatic three times at
the oncoming mongolians at short range the heavy
radite-charged bullets from the weapon penetrated three
or four men before losing their energy and the slaughter
inflicted by the three shots momentarily halted the ad-
vance

  this way charley cried williams

  hamilton fired twice more and then turned and ran in
the direction which williams had indicated being careful
to keep his body between jane and the mongolians ap-
parently they were not armed with pistols or rifles for
not a shot was fired at them but as they retreated the
advance of their enemies was resumed

  around a corner they dashed and found williams
standing before an open panel in the wall

  this way  he cried and they followed him in be-
fore the leading mongolians had rounded the comer the
panel slid noiselessly shut and the fugitives were in
darkness

  take my hand directed williams

  they followed him silently through a long stretch of
darkness presently he paused

  there is a panel in the wall here that leads into a
large room with a staircase on the far side we will


amazing stories

follow that up to the roof of the building and there we
will find a lookout tower surmounting the rest of the
building it is fairly roomy yet small enough to defend
easily i managed to smuggle enough supplies into it to
last the three of us for several months now to see
whether the way is clear

  he drew a pocket x-ray torch from his pocket and
pressed a button directing the beam on the wall before
him a spot on the wall slowly grew misty and then dis-
appeared through the hole thus created the three gazed
the room before them was empty

  all right exclaimed williams i am going to open
the panel be ready to make a dash for the stairs

  the panel slid open and the three raced across the
room and up the stairs that opened before them they
were halfway up when a shout came from the room be-
low hamilton glanced back and saw a dozen mon-
golians led by a russian streaming through a doorway
into the room below he raised his pistol and fired
rapidly

  come on charley cried williams from the stairs
above him dont waste time in shooting they wont
dare to fire toward the dome

  the top of the stairs was blocked by a massive door
but williams swung it open and shut it behind hamilton
in time to block the way of their pursuers across the
roof they raced and into the lookout tower a russian
blocked their way but a shot from williams pistol dis-
posed of the last obstacle and they entered the tower and
bolted its massive door behind them just as the foremost
of their pursuers burst open the door leading to the roof
and poured forth in pursuit

  hold them off for a minute with your pistol char-
ley cried williams as the door clanged shut theres a
machine gun on the other wall that ill have in a
minute

  hamilton fired rapidly and accurately but more of the
mongolians appeared momentarily in the doorway and
the leaders of the rush had almost reached the door of
the tower when a crackle of machine-gun fire came from
his side and the attacking wave withered and crumpled
the mongolians dropping like flies before the deadly rain
of radite-charged bullets for a moment the roof was
deserted

  miss hunter can you fire a machine gun good
take charge of this one those loopholes have syn-
chronized stroboscopes attached which well rig up as
soon as i can find the trigger motors and synchronizing
gears you two hold back the rush while i try to use
this communicator and get in touch with washington or
whats left of it

  he adjusted the communicator to the general wave-
length and sent out call after call with no response
after a few attempts he gave it up and returned to the
others

  nashky has an interference wave at work he re-
ported and i couldnt get through i have vital news
too news that would help a lot if i could get it out to
say nothing of the possibility of a rescue for us

  here take this gun directed hamilton ill try
bobs interference piercer

  he took a small disc resembling a microphone from his
pocket and started for the communicator

  what the dickens is that  asked williams

  my brothers latest invention was the reply it is
still in a purely experimental stage but it may help it
raises the pitch of the signals far above the pitch of the

ordinary communicator and it will get through any ordi-
nary interference wave bob has the only other one and
our only chance is that he may have it hooked in and be
listening its a pretty slim chance ill admit but it is a
chance

he carefully connected the interference piercer with
the communicator on the wall and sent out a call
there was no result and he adjusted the instruments and
called again silence rewarded his efforts again and
again he made delicate adjustments and sent forth his
calls but without response he gave it up at length and
started back toward the guns when a tiny whisper of
sound came from the communicator with a bound he
was back at the instrument and was feverishly toiling
at the adjustments gradually the voice came in clearer
until all could hear the words issuing from the instru-
ment

  -hamilton speaking came from the instrument
general hamilton speaking is that you charley 
bob cried captain hamilton where are you
i am at balinskys laboratory at pole mountain but
the more important thing is where are you

  at nashkys base in the gobi near pilutai as well as
i can make out williams of the secret service jane
hunter and i are here besieged in the lookout tower of
an old monastery which nashky has converted into a
stronghold for his use can you come after us

  not a chance charley you have no idea of the
condition of things the world is about finished old
man there are solvite areas on all sides of us and in
another week they will cover the whole of north
america even if i could come after you what could
i do against nashkys ship

  plenty bob listen i have been working here for
a month and i have managed to do something inside
the magazine of nashkys ship is a shell that looks just
like his solvite shells but it is full of radite it has a
detonation fuse attached to it set for xc all you
have to do is to get within three miles of his craft and
send out a wave and he is done the radite will set the
solvite loose and you know what that means

  no ship can cross the affected areas

  yes one can im a physicist and not a chemist but
williams has been working in nashkys laboratory and
im going to let him talk i think that he knows some-
thing

  williams hastened to the communicator

  this is operative williams general he said i
have the secret of combating solvite at first i thought
it worked on the ether but it doesnt it works on
nitrogen and disintegrates it entirely practically every-
thing has nitrogen either in its chemical makeup or else
occluded or dissolved in it and so it goes up an argon
screen will stop it entirely

  how are you going to confine the argon 

  alloy duralumin with one-half of one per cent of
palladium the alloy will occlude nearly a hundred
volumes of argon under the proper conditions anneal
the stuff almost at the melting point in an atmosphere
of argon blow fresh argon through your annealing
furnace until all traces of argon have been washed out
and then chill it suddenly in liquid argon it is a per-
fect screen against solvite enclose yourself in a shell
of that stuff with an atmosphere of argon and oxygen
inside and you are safe enclose a ship in a shell of it
and it will cross the infected areas safely nashky has
the last war



his ship thus equipped look out for solvite around
here though when you get out of the ship we are full
of it here nashky takes his ship in and out through a
double port to be sure that his argon is confined

  our metallurgists will be at work in ten minutes
replied general hamilton you can look for a rescue
party as soon as we can make up a ship like you suggest
how many men has nashky

  about two hundred russians and over a thousand
mongolians

  pretty heavy odds but well try it we can muster
only about three hundred effectives all told but well see

what we-

  there was a raucous crash and then silence from the
communicator

  nashky wrecked it reported williams as he re-
joined hamilton and jane hunter however we got
our message out and now all there is to do is to hold the
fort and wait for a rescue party

  holding it may be more of a job than we are count-
ing on said hamilton grimly

  i think that we are safe if we can get a stroboscope
rigged up in time replied williams nashky wont
dare to use anything heavy this near his dome for if he
lets the solvite in he would be in as bad a fix as we
would be

  tell me how this all happened begged jane as
williams and hamilton began to connect the stroboscope
which would prevent bullets from entering the loophole
through which their guns were trained to fire

  i dont know much about it confessed hamilton
i had just finished setting the fuse on the radite shell
i had introduced into nashkys magazine when i saw the
communicator glow and i heard williams voice telling
me to hurry to the cell where we were first taken what
happened to you

  when we were separated three weeks ago i was left
in the cell replied jane i was kept on general labor
and they worked me pretty hard i can tell you i had to
keep up with those mongolians but i kept my spirits
up for i knew that both of you were working for me
this morning i was moving some boxes and my shirt got
caught on a corner and it tore open i covered up my
bosom as rapidly as possible but one of the russians
who was superintending the work saw me before i could
do so he came over at once and despite my struggles
he tore my clothes open and then ordered me seized and
taken to my cell they were dragging me toward it
when you two appeared and shot my captors that is all
i know about it

  i can supply the rest said williams i have been
working in the laboratory for two weeks and that was
where i learned about solvite i hadnt seen either of
you face to face for a week for i didnt dare to risk
suspicion by looking you up but i kept tabs on both of
you by means of an x-ray television set in the labora-
tory i happened to be watching jane when she tore her
shirt and i switched into the magazine wavelength and
warned charley before i started out to try and rescue
you i had located this place and stored it over a week
agoand had itall planned tomake a break for it soon
but i wanted to stay in the laboratory until i learned
how to neutralize the solvite i believe that nashky
knows but if he does he is the only one who does i
have learned this much however it is not permanent
the effect begins to diminish in about ninety days and in
two hundred days it entirely passes away i learned a

good deal about nashkys plans he plans to let the
solvite run its course until only a few small areas are
clear of it and then to visit these areas and capture
women and bring them here he will hold them captive
until the two hundred days have passed and then he plans
to repeople the world with these women and his follow-
ers it is a devilish-

  here they come  cried jane

  williams broke off his talk and seized a machine gun
from the doorway leading to the roof the mongolians
and russians streamed over the roof clad in a peculiar
flexible armor the radite-charged bullets had no ap-
parent effect on them and they pressed forward they
were battering at the door when williams ceased firing
and threw open his shutter

   do you see this  he cried holding up a black object
this is a radite bomb unless this roof is cleared be-
fore i count ten i will explode it and this place and
everything in it will go up one two three four
five six

  he ceased counting and laughed the roof was de-
serted

  as long as we can scare them off we are safe he
said did you realize what that armor was it was
merely a wire mesh connected with a nashky generator
downstairs supplying power to each one nothing could
have penetrated that screen

  what next asked hamilton

  nothing the next move is up to nashky he
wont dare to try force for he knows that we know just
how much mercy we can expect from him if we are
captured and that we would probably just as soon go to
glory by exploding a solvite bomb here as to have him
throw us out into the solvite outside hell try to
catch us napping however so we must stand watch and
watch and never leave the observation post for an in-
stant day or night we have food and water here for
six months and ill give general hamilton two weeks
before he is battering away at these walls

tife said feodor balinsky even human life

  ju which is commonly presumed to represent the
highest development on the planet is merely a matter of
chemical changes with all of which we are well ac-
quainted

  he was speaking in the main lecture room of his labo-
ratory at pole mountain and his audience was the little
group of scientists who had gathered there to offer the
last futile shreds of resistance to ivan nashky

  when the messages of williams and hamilton had
been received two weeks before the lethargy which had
temporarily overwhelmed the gathered scientists disap-
peared like magic and was replaced by a scene of bustle
and hurry such as had seldom been seen before often
men had fought against time to save their lives but this
was the first time that men had fought against time with
the fate of all life on the planet depending upon the re-
sults of their labors the first task had been to protect
the laboratory against the approach of the solvite which
at that time was less than seventy-two hours away ba-
linsky had a small amount of palladium among his stores
and it was hurriedly alloyed with duralumin by the
metallurgists while huge air compressors were started to
liquefy the air in order that the argon could by a se-
ries of fractional distillations be extracted from it a
supply was soon obtained and the ingots of palladium-


amazing stories

duralumin alloy were annealed in the manner which wil-
liams had described when the process was finished
the ingots were rolled into huge sheets paper thin and
these were secured to a framework to make a hemi-
spherical dome over the laboratory and the surrounding
grounds the work was accomplished just in time for
the air had hardly been replaced with a mixture of argon
and oxygen before observers reported that the solvite
infection had reached them

  the task of constructing double locks was pushed
forward and double doors of such a size that a large
 aerostat could be safely let out into outer air were con-
structed the construction of an aerostat with propellers
and elevating fans of the precious alloy and armored
with a skin of it was the next step the matter of bush-
ings and housings for the propellers and elevating fans
offered some mechanical problems but they were solved
and eventually the projected craft fully manned and
equipped among other things with a huge detonation
projector had sallied forth and taken the air and had
started toward the base in the gobi desert from which
nashky operated there had been no difficulty in find-
ing it at full speed the armored aerostat drove toward
it to be met two miles away by nashkys black menace
nearer and nearer the two ships ranged through bi-
noculars general hamilton looked out through a port
through which a gentle stream of argon was blown
driving back the poisoned nitrogen which would have
turned the ship and crew into shapeless masses of
matter had it penetrated into the interior his eyes were
glued on a gun port in the forward end of the nashky
craft while at his side an engineer kept the detonation
projector set at xc carefully trained on the on-
coming craft presently the gun port slid open and the
muzzle of a three-inch rifle projected out

  fire exclaimed general hamilton

  the engineer closed a switch and a dull report shook
the aerostat the engineer released the lever and closed
it again and once more the dull boom sounded the
second detonation was unnecessary even before it
sounded it was evident that the black ship was falling
fascinated general hamilton and the engineer watched
the mighty fabric lose shape and plunge an amorphqus
globule of black and silver to the ground where it spread
slowly over the ground like a ball of tallow melting be-
fore a hot fire

  sic transit gloria mundi exclaimed general hamil-
ton as he watched the doom of the mighty engine of de-
struction which had depopulated an entire world now
crushed by the very power which it had employed to
work its evil

  the black monster disposed of the rescue ship turned
its attention to the great dome of silvery material which
loomed before it

  if that skin is as thin as the one at pole mountain
we can ram right through it remarked the navigator of
the aerostat as he joined the general

   i doubt if it is but we can try replied the general
full speed ahead

  the aerostat leaped forward at a tremendous speed
nearer and nearer to the dome it came it seemed as
though it were about to strike when a few feet from
the silver metal the ship came to a halt with a shock
which nearly caved in the bows despite the utmost
power that could be coaxed from the atomic engines not
mjnch nearer to the shining skin could the ship get

  of course cried general hamilton we should

have expected a protective film of energy from a battery
of nashky generators i had overlooked the certainty
of that

  we can return and equip the ship with a hamilton
generator general and come back here and put them out
of business cant we asked the engineer we wont
have that ship to worry us and we can take our time
getting on their primary wavelength

  unfortunately nashky has so improved his appara-
tus that i doubt the efficacy of the hamilton generator
against it however with plenty of time i may be able
to tune it in long enough to let a crew through even if
i cant kill it permanently

   ill be glad to lead a storming party sir

  thanks id lead it myself if there were any use in
it hes my brother you know however there is no
use in discussing that even if we could breach the
walls we would only be slaughtered without advancing
our cause allowing that a hundred were wiped out
when that ship went down it still leaves us up against
odds of something like eleven hundred to thirty a little
more than we can hope to fight against we have got to
either get some reinforcements somewhere and i dont
suppose there are any people left alive on the earth out-
side of here and pole mountain or else use strategy the
next thing is to get into communication with the pris-
oners

   their communicator is wrecked isnt it general 
it is silent which may mean that it was wrecked by
a greater interference load than it was designed for or
that nashky has shut off the power however charley
still has his interference piercer or i missmy guess i
cant conceive of an overload wrecking that we had
better go home and let me try to rig up a sender of
sufficient power that it will affect his instrument directly
without the aid of a communicator

   sadly enough for all their partial success the aerostat
had returned to pole mountain and reported their fail-
ure general hamilton had plunged into his experi-
ments while balinsky after brooding over hamiltons
words for a day had summoned the chemists and
surgeons among the survivors to meet with him in the
laboratory lecture room they had assembled and
balinsky addressed them

  i repeat my assertion he went on that life is
merely a matter of a series of chemical changes does
anyone dispute that statement 

  there was a silence and balinsky resumed

  fifty years ago he said doctor alexis carrel
demonstrated that tissue unattached to any complete
living organism could be kept alive in the laboratory
and could even be made to grow and multiply this was
the basis as you all know of the present method of
growing tissue to replace that destroyed or removed
from the living body the replacement of portions of
flesh or skin has been commonplace for thirty years
and during the last decade the medical profession has
advanced to such a state that even whole limbs have
been successfully manufactured and grafted upon living
persons that leads us up to the point which i intended
to make when i started

  it has been the opinion of many great surgeons and
chemists i among them that it is perfectly possible
to construct an entire human being from laboratory-
grown tissue and to have it function normally as a living
being the classical way to start such an experiment
would be to take portions of each type of tissue from a
the last war



living body grow them in cultures and from this base
build up the complete body while it has never so far
been done to my knowledge i imagine that you will
agree with me that such a feat while very difficult is
probably not impossible

  the greatest difficulty would be the manufacture of
the brain tissue and the proper connecting of that tissue
once you had it grown to the complex system of nerves
which it would be necessary to install in your synthetic
body said dr von helmer

  that doctor replied balinsky is your portion of
the experiment i think that every one here will concede
that you know more of the mechanism of the human
brain than any other living man i expect you to connect
up the nerves and brain after i have supplied the tissues
and assembled them into the proper form

  ill try it

  that is all that i ask doctor i thank you for your
offer of cooperation my idea is this general hamil-
ton says that we must have reinforcements from some-
where in order to cope with the brute force of the hordes
of savages whom nashky lias assembled at his base
since there are no living persons in the world to whom
we may turn for help it behooves us to manufacture
our personnel the same as we manufacture our material

a suppressed murmur of excitement and sup-
pressed applause rose from his listeners at the sheer
audacity of balinskys suggestion he waited until the
disturbance had died

  is there anyone here who will not aid the experiment
to the limit of his ability

  a silence replied to his question

  in order to get heart and brain tissue it is quite prob-
able that at least one person must lay down his life

  a dozen men were  their feet in an instant clamor-
ing for the honor

  thank you gentlemen i will select my man and call
on him-when i am sure that i need him as i said the
taking of such tissue would be the classical method of
procedure but it is not the one which i wish to employ
i have another and more daring plan doctor ruthven
you know more about the rare gases of the atmosphere
than anyone else tell us what you know about argon
the aged british scientist rose

  lord rayleigh he said was the first to observe
that while specimens of oxygen and other gases made
purposely from various sources always had the same
density nitrogen was an exception one litre of nitro-
gen made from air and supposed to be pure weighed
 grams when the gas was manufactured by de-
composition of various compounds such as urea and
certain oxides of nitrogen the mean weight of a litre was
always found to be  grams this difference
amounting to about seven milligrams was much greater
than could be accounted for on the hypothesis of experi-
mental error and rayleigh suspected that some heavier
gas was present in atmospheric nitrogen in  sir
william then professor ramsey obtained pure argon
by the removal of the greatly preponderating nitrogen
by means of magnesium this new gas had a density
referred to the base of oxygen equals thirty-two of
thirty-nine point nine more than one-third heavier than
nitrogen its molecule consists of one atom hence its
atomic and molecular weights are the same when lique-
fied it boils at- c and when frozen it melts at-
c aside from the facts which i have given you

little if anything is known about it it has never been
found to enter into any form of chemical combination
in fact its name signifies this fact for it comes from
the greek word agyo meaning inactive or lazy

  have attempts ever been made to activate it and make
it enter into chemical combinations asked balinsky

  not in recent years to the best of my knowledge
nothing was expected to be gained from such a combina-
tion and i think that little if any work has been done
along these lines

  as i understand it the gas more nearly resembles
nitrogen than any other except for its failure to enter
into chemical combinations

  in a broad way yes

  do you think that you could make it enter into
chemical combinations with the valence and character-
istics of nitrogen

  possibly by occluding it in platinum and exposing
it to radium emanations or to a high tension arc at
enormous temperatures it might be activated what the
valence would be in such a case i cannot even guess
why do you ask 

  since argon is the only substance which is not af-
fected by solvite it is my plan to attempt to build up
tissue in the laboratory substituting argon in place of
nitrogen and thus get soldiers who need no protection
but who are able to go into a solvite-affected area freely
and safely

  again the murmur of excitement and applause rose
but doctor ruthven leaped to his feet

  i am sorry to shatter your dreams doctor balinsky
he said but it is my idea that the reason why argon
is not affected by solvite is its inertness the very property
which you propose to destroy if you succeed in acti-
vating it to the extent to which nitrogen is activated will
it not in all probability be as readily affected by solvite
as nitrogen is

  such may be the case but should it prove to be so
we are no worse off than we would be if we constructed
our synthetic men on a nitrogen base to start with if
you will initiate your experiments at once doctor ruth-
ven i will be in a better position to predict the ultimate
success or failure of mine in any event for the benefit
of the persons assembled here i will announce something
which i had intended to give out just about the time that
this great trouble came on us all my students and i
have actually succeeded in creating life in the laboratory
that is we have artificially made from inert substances
tissues of many sorts which have lived and multiplied
under laboratory conditions we have even gone so far
as to create a ball of tissue which we have covered with a
skin and exposed to sunlight and air and it has lived
moved taken nourishment through its skin exhibited
all of the phenomena of metabolism including that of
excreting waste products through the pores and has
continued to live thrive and grow larger for several
months consequently with von helmers assistance
i feel confident of our ultimate success in creating a liv-
ing body in physical characteristics at least resembling
a human being whether we will be able to substitute
argon for nitrogen in its tissues i cannot predict and
whether the being we create will be a rational thinking
being i cannot state but at least gentlemen we will do
our best

  may i ask just one thing balinsky spoke up von
helmer

  certainly


amazing stories

  have you ever read mary wolstencroft shelleys
book frankenstein 

  i have not

  i have a copy and before you start your experiments
i will ask of you as a favor that you read it under-
stand this i am perfectly willing to help you to the limit
f my abilities but before we start i want you to read
this book and realize exactly the risk which you are
taking

through their argon-protected periscope the pris-
oners had watched the destruction of nashkys ship
and the abortive efforts of their rescuers to penetrate the
wall of resistance offered by the nashky generators

  damn those generators exclaimed williams
whsn i said that your brother would be hammering
at these walls in two weeks i reckoned without those
things

  well he cant get in to help us and we cant get out
to help him so what is next on your schedule asked
hamilton

  we must help him we may not be able to get out
to do so and we might not be able to do much good if
we did get out but inside we may be able to do a great
deal we must destroy those generators

  youre crazy exclaimed hamilton we are cooped
up here unable to get near them to destroy them or any-
thing else even if by some miracle we could reach
them none of us knows enough about their construction
to do them any damage that nashky or some of his as-
sistants could not repair in a few minutes

  im not so sure about that

  what do you mean

  do you remember his attack on st helena 
  certainly

  the nashky generators there were completely done
up

  that was done by solvite

  yes by solvite b which is active only locally we
havfe plenty of that here we also have plenty of radite
bombs and the gas from a radite explosion contains ni-
trogen now do you understand or must i put it in
simpler words

  captain hamilton rose and bowed gravely to williams
ralph williams he said solemnly you are a genius
when and if we ever get out of this mess i am going
to get von helmer to remove a portion of the stuff
which fills my skull and replace it with a good grade of
sawdust in the hope that it will improve my mentality
stow that stuff returned williams i just happened
to think of it you are the one who is going to do it
can you make a detonation fuse

  easily

  that is the first step can you make a detonation
projector

  yes a crude one but one that will send a wave a
half mile

  that will be strong enough get to work at once and
fix one of those radite bombs with a detonation fuse and
fasten it to a solvite b bomb so that the radite will
set if off when it explodes then make a projector
so that we can fire them off from here now for the
third thing can you rig up an emergency communicator
which will send for a couple of miles 

  i doubt it

  it is not essential although it would help for it
would enable us to notify your brother just when we

fire our bomb however if you cant do it it cant
be helped we musnt expect everything how long
will it take you to get the fuse and projector ready
i can fix the fuse in a day or two but it will take
considerably longer to fix up a detonation projector
which will work it will possibly take a week probably
two

  all right get to work on it we will relieve you
from your guard shifts and jane and i will take eight
hours on and eight off can you stand that jane

  i was wondering how soon my turn would come to
do something i came along in the hope that i would
be able to do something but so far i have been nothing
but a burden on your hands

  not by a long shot you havent said captain hamil-
ton warmly if it hadnt been for you we could never
have kept going as long as we have you have been
of as much value as we have in keeping watch and if it
had come to fighting a third machine gun might easily
have turned the day in our favor dont think for a
minute that you have been anything other than a big
help

  to a mechanic like captain hamilton a simple matter
like a detonation fuse presented no difficulties and two
days of work produced one which he pronounced after
test as mechanically perfect and ready to be attached to
a solvite shell given a machine shop and the materials
which lie wanted a few days would have seen the end
of the whole task but he was continually forced to
improvise and substitute his first model failed to
carry the wave over five feet and he was forced to tear
it down and start fresh in an attempt to make his appara-
tus more powerful he worked fourteen hours a day
at it while jane hunter and williams stood guard eight
hours at a stretch the strain was telling on all of them
but hamilton was doing his best and all of them tight-
ened up their belts and stuck grimly to their tasks

  almost daily some attempt was made to take them by
surprise but the quick challenge of the one on guard and
a prompt showing of the dreaded radite bomb was
enough to put their attackers to flight after six weeks
of unremitting labor hamilton threw down his tools one
evening and announced that his task was completed

  will it work charley asked jane as she looked at
the crude machine before him

  it will he replied i have had hopes for a week
that it would but i said nothing until i had it completed
and tested it is not very powerful but it will project a
wave as far as the limits of the duralumin screen and
i have reconstructed my fuse to make it exceptionally
sensitive it would not be safe to fire a gun in the same
room with it for even that slight shock would probably
set it off the only thing left is to locate those gener-
ators i will rig up a sound locator tomorrow that will
find then in a hurry and then train my projector in the
right direction the only thing left is to place the bomb
and ralph can do that tomorrow

  id be mighty glad to old man but i am afraid
thats your job said williams from his couch i dont
know ten words of russian

  i dont know one retorted hamilton

  good grief how are we going to plant it 

  i thought you had that all planned out

  i expected you to do it we can easily blow the
light fuses and in the darkness i expected you to run the
gauntlet and place the bomb and come back where did
i ever get the idea that you could talk russian 
the last war



  im sure i dont know i cant talk a word of it
  i can interrupted jane

  how come 

  i lived on st helena for six years and i used to
 talk with some of the prisoners nearly every day i
 can talk it like a native i havent been of much use
 so far but now i can be ill place the bomb
 nonsense exclaimed both men in unison

  its not nonsense its no more risky for me than
 it would be for you if you spoke russian and since you
 dont it isnt half as risky for me as it would be for you
 besides there is about ten times the chance that i will be
 successful that there is that one of you would be and we
 wont get but one chance at it it the one who tries it
 is detected no other attempt will ever have a chance
 shes right charley said williams

  i wont listen to her taking that risk

  dont listen then charley plug your ears and look
 the other way because im going to do it

  youre not ill do it myself

  not a chance charley if jane doesnt im the
 one to try it if i am caught you can make up another
 fuse and make another try at it but if you were caught
 the whole works would be up i couldnt make a fuse if
 i had to but im not going to try it either jane is
 i wont stand for it

  then sit down i know just how you feel old man
 and so does jane although you havent said anything
 but its two to one against you and she is elected
 captain hamilton subsided into a sulky silence and
 williams went on

  it really isnt as risky as it seems at first glance
 when we blow the fuse and put out the lights there is
 going to be a good deal of disturbance and excitement
 below jane can slip out and get over the roof in a
 few moments and then slip down to the generator room
 and plant the bomb and get back to the roof without
 much chance of being detected from there it is easy
 sailing for we can cover her retreat with the guns and
 with the solvite bomb if we find it necessary

  when shall i make the attempt asked jane

  as soon as we can get the generators located is as
 good a time as any i guess what did you say
 charley 

  i didnt speak

  i thought you did

  so did i cried jane listen

  the three sat in tense silence for a moment nothing
 was heard and then williams spoke

  there it is again it sounds like charleys voice
 from a distance

  with an exclamation of disbelief hamilton sprang to
 his feet and dashed to the other side of the room at-
 tached to the useless communicator was the little inter-
 ference piercer which he had attached months before
 he picked it up in a gingerly manner and pressed it to
 his ear

  what is it charley  cried jane excitedly

  hush its bobs voice

  impossible ejaculated williams

  shut up i want to hear this

  he listened intently for several minutes and then
 dropped the disc and picked up some tools

  what are you doing asked williams

  dont interrupt bob told me how to modify this
 thing

for half an hour he labored at the device and then
reconnected it with the communicator and listened
intently he took the disc from his ear and spoke
quietly and distinctly into it

  this is charley bob can you hear me

  he replaced the instrument to his ear and then turned
to his companions with an expression of exultation on his
face

  communication has been reestablished with the
world he announced

  williams and jane pressed forward

  get the news begged the former

  all right wait a minute until i make an adjust-
ment

  he tightened the diaphragm of the interference
piercer and spoke into it again he listened carefiilly for
several minutes and then turned to his companions

  the news is good he said our messages got
through just in time so far as bob knows the whole
world has gone under with the exception of this place
and pole mountain they have a palladium-duralumin
dome like this one filled with argon-oxygen atmosphere
and they have about three hundred effectives and about
five hundred women and children assembled there bob
says that they have got reinforcements from some place
i couldnt make out where and they are ready to make
another attempt on this place he wants to know how
thick our shell is

  let me talk cried williams as he took the instru-
ment from hamilton hello general hamilton this
is williams the shell here is about an inch thick that
is the main shell i dont know how thick the doors are

i	am afraid that you couldnt ram successfully if that is
what you are planning on when were you planning to
attack dont do it wait another twenty-four hours
and we may be able to help what the nashky gen-
erators  dont worry we have our plans all made to
put them out of business can nashky tap this device
and hear what we are saying no good enough
then i can talk wait at least twenty-four hours keep
us advised of where you are and keep far enough from
here so that a sound locator cant get your elevating
fans when you get the word from us come ahead as
fast as you can well put the generators out of business
so that you can blow the shell with radite if we are
lucky you will be able to get to us and take us on board
before the argon is dissipated enough to let the solvite
start work on us never mind trying to do nashky
and his crew the solvite will take care of them as soon
as you blow this shell blow this place up no matter
what you do even if you have to send us to kingdom
come along with the rest of it as long as this base
stays here you are in constant danger yes sir no
sir i dont think so yes sir we will do that very
well sir well start listening in for you in about twenty-
four hours

  he turned to captain hamilton

  all plans made he said get busy on the sound
locator so that we can get those prepared bombs placed
all set said captain hamilton tensely

  right replied williams are you ready jane
  all ready she whispered

   then gridley you may fire 

  captain hamilton bent over an improvised induction
generator and turned it rapidly by means of a crank a
low note became audible rose to a shrill whine and died


amazing stories

away in silence and hamiltons grunt as he strained at
the crank became audible a sudden ting sounded on
the air and the interior of the dome was plunged in in-
tense darkness williams opened the door of the watch
tower and jane slipped out on her errand of destruction
the deadly bombs with the detonation fuse gripped
close to her body the listening men heard a gruff chal-
lenge from the doorway followed by an answer in
russian in janes voice the guard replied in a suspi-
cious voice and captain hamilton gripped his pistol
tightly and made ready to rush to her assistance janes
voice rang out again with an imperious note and the
guard could be heard to move back

  thank god she got by him muttered williams
the rest should be easy for her

  for five minutes the two men sat tense in the dark-
ness waiting for the sound of janes return

  pm going after her announced hamilton with sud-
den determination

  sit down you fool youll only add to her danger
if you try any stunt like that

 let go of me im going-

  without warning the lights suddenly flashed on and
the interior of the huge dome was a light as day just
as the lights came on there was the sound of a scuffle just
outside the doorway leading to the roof followed by a
feminine scream with an oath captain hamilton tore
himself loose and ran across the roof williams at his
heels before they reached the door there was a high
pitched yell that ended suddenly in a bubbling grunt and
jane appeared in the doorway a knife streaming with
blood in her hand after her came a dozen mongolians
in hot pursuit

  down jane  shouted hamilton

  obediently she dropped flat and hamiltons heavy
pistol barked a defiance to her pursuers the mongolians
had had no time to don their protective armor and they
went down like tenpins before the deadly accuracy
of hamiltons fire the survivors paused and williams
sprang forward and lifted jane to her feet and raced to-
ward the watch tower with her hamilton covering the
retreat with his pistol hardly had the door of the tower
slammed behind them than a fresh group appeared in
the doorway clothed in the generator-fed armor will-
iams picked up a radite bomb and threatened their ad-
vance they hesitated but urged on by a russian who
remained discreetly in the rear they disregarded the
threat and pressed forward

  barricade the door quick cried williams as he
ran to the improvised communicator

  general hamilton he cried into it come ahead
and hurry we are being attacked in force and i dont
know how long we can hold out

  he dropped the communicator and hastened back to
aid hamilton in dragging everything movable in the
room against the door outside a hundred mongolians
howled and attacked the door with axes the massive
teak withstood the attack for some time but gradually
it began to splinter

 fire the bomb charley cried williams if you
dont it will be too late

  hamilton bent over his makeshift detonation projector
and closed a switch a dull boom resounded in the
closed room williams fired his pistol pointblank through
the gap in the doorway at a grinning face but his bullet
produced no result

  try it again charley he cried the first shot
didnt do it

  hamilton bent over the projector and worked des-
perately again and again the dull boom resounded
through the room sounding over the blows of the
axes which were rapidly enlarging the hole in the door-
way it was large enough now to admit a man and the
attackers drew back and one of them began to worm
his way through williams struck at him with an axe
but the blows were warded off by the impenetrable armor
which the man wore again captain hamilton closed
the switch of his projector the dull boom sounded
just as williams swung his axe again at the head of the
entering figure the blow went home and the mon-
golian fell forward

  to the guns shouted williams

  from the two machine guns mounted on each side of
the doorway came a stream of fire and the surviving
mongolians turned and fled as they realized that their
armor no longer protected them as they did so hamil-
ton turned again to his induction generator and in a few
moments the dome was plunged in darkness

  good lord weve done it now gasped williams
as he pointed toward the dome above them through a
hundred holes the sunlight was streaming

  the argon will leak out and let nitrogen in and then
the solvite will take care of this place he cried some
one shot a little too high it wont be long now

  look cried jane from the periscope here comes
the ship

  abandoning their guns the two men joined her and
gazed at the ground glass screen of the periscope only
a few miles away and splitting the air like a rocket
came a heavy cruiser with the colors of the united states
emblazoned on her bow her propellers were suddenly
reversed and she slowed down and came to a halt a few
hundred yards from the dome from her bow a gun
spoke and under the influence of the radite shell a large
section of the skin of the dome disintegrated into gas
again the gun spoke and another section disappeared
through the gap thus formed the ship drove at a high
speed and came to a halt on the roof a door opened
and a party of men streamed forth with them they
brought three shining boxes that looked like coffins six
of them raced toward the watch tower with these boxes
while the balance threw themselves into a skirmish line
before the door leading into the interior of the building

  the men with the boxes sat them down and threw
them open

  quick cried the leader of the rescue party miss
hunter captain hamilton mister williams into
these boxes at once

  the three prisoners squeezed through the doorway
and leaped into the coffin-like boxes which were instantly
slammed shut on them the six men picked up the boxes
and carried them at a run to the waiting ship through
double ports they introduced them into the body of the
craft a shout from their leader brought the skirmish
line to the ship and with her crew and the rescued three
on board the aerostat shot out through the opening
which her gun had blasted in the dome

  the lids of two of the boxes were opened and captain
hamilton was soon wringing his brothers hand while
williams was receiving the congratulations and thanks
of general hunter

  where is jane cried captain hamilton
the last war



  still in her box replied his brother look at this
and you will see how close a shave yon three had

  captain hamilton looked at the closed box and shud-
dered in closing the box a portion of jane hunters
garment had been left outside it had lost form and
drops of a gummy plastic substance were running down
the sides of the box

  bring an argon cylinder directed general hunter

  a cylinder of liquid argon was brought and while
two men threw open the box a third directed a stream
of the protecting gas on the edge of the garment while
a fourth man cut off a portion with a pair of alloy shears

  throw it out directed the general

  the cut off portion of the garment was picked up in a
pair of alloy tongs and dropped through a double port
into the outside air

  do you wish to take a last look at your prison
asked general hamilton

  jane folded in her fathers arms made no reply
williams and captain hamilton stepped to an argon pro-
tected porthole and looked at the huge dome before
them as they watched the door opened and a figure
appeared it staggered forward for a few steps and then
slowly collapsed and lost form spreading in a great wot
of color over the landscape

  did you recognize him gasped williams

  nashky replied captain hamilton

  i had an idea that he had not gone up with his ship
but i wasnt sure of it at any rate thats the end of
him

  i here is one thing that has been puzzling me

  a ever since we got your message general said
williams you spoke of getting reinforcements from
somewhere and i can see that you have them where
did you get them and what sort of men are they who are
able to go out into the poisoned air without argon pro-
tection 

  well replied general hamilton that is a long
story the details of which you must wait for until we
get to pole mountain i am not a chemist and i doubt
if i could explain for i hardly understand it myself
the nub of the thing is that they were not born at all
balinsky manufactured them in the laboratory when
we learned what your situation was we sent a rescue
ship after you and managed to destroy nashkys ship
but we couldnt force a way into the dome we didnt
have strength enough to do so even if the nashky gen-

the

 erators had not been in operation and we know that we
 needed help there were no people left alive so balinsky
 started in with von helmers help and made these
 soldiers you have seen in action today the reason that
 they are able to go into the solvite areas without argon
 protection is that they contain argon in their flesh instead
 of nitrogen the nitrogen that is in the ordinary human
 body had been replaced atom for atom with argon
 but argon will not enter into chemical combinations
 objected williams

   it wont ordinarily but ruthven of liverpool is
 among our group and he managed to activate it so that
 it would enter into combinations with the same valence
 and chemical characteristics as nitrogen

   in that case i should think it would be affected by
 solvite

   so ruthven feared but it turned out not to be so
 these men are entirely immune to solvite and can work
 in it without trouble we had about fifty made when
 we left and i expect that balinsky will have quite a
 few more ready by the time we get home you told us
 that solvite lost its power fairly soon in fact we can
 see that it action is diminishing in virulence already
 and we are planning to make a few thousand of these
 fellows and turn them out and let them start getting the
 world policed up against the time when we can leave
 our sanctuary at pole mountain and resume our in-
 terrupted lives-those of us who are left

   so it was balinskys doing was it is there any
 limit to that mans genius 

   none so far as i know he once almost wiped out
 mankind and then in turn saved a remnant and is the
 man who is going to make life on the planet again
 possible had nashkys genius only been turned in the
 right direction what a pair they would have made

 harley murmured jane a little later i hope
      that our children are all boys

   why dear he asked

   because i would hate to think of a daughter of mine
 growing up and marrying one of these synthetic men
 and i am afraid that that will be about all there would
 be for her to marry they are brave and gentlemanly
 but they can have no souls

   why not dear 

   because they are made in a laboratory and a labora-
 tory is ruled by science and not by emotion it may
 produce a brain but it can never produce a soul

when inca-land
        revolted

by woods peters

        t can hardly be beyond the realm of possibility for some young and enter-
        prising scientist who has the rare gift of a good imagination a distin-
        guishing feature of the great scientist to discover albeit accidentally a means
        by which to transmit personality after that it would be only a minor matter
        to devise a means for accompanying such transmission with the voice in
        this fascinating story of future achievement in science our new author tells
        in an absorbing manner of startling events in a hidden land

illustrated by briggs

v  vhis is the story of an accidental discovery
 as is true with many discoveries of man-

    	kind it was the merest freak of chance that
m showed the trail a trail that led not only
through intricate diplomatic negotiations and
a devastating one-sided warfare but eventually opened
the way for the mutual understanding between na-
tions which we enjoy today for without this dis-
covery not only would the countries of the world have
come under the control of that strange and formerly
unknown race of super-scientists from the supposedly
savage country of inland incaland but our modem de-
velopment of the science of transmission of the per-
sonality would be unknown save to a few who would
hold an unbreakable power over the rest of the human
race

  the term transmission of the personality is per-
haps a little vague but it is the only term that has been
coined to designate the scientific accomplishment

  today the discovery is of as common use as was the
radio in  for the necessary electrical equipment
has been brought within the reach of practically all
and the advantages the new science has brought us are
common knowledge today

  considerable expenditures of cash for trips to distant
lands is a thing of the past telephones are practically
obsolete and ships and air lines are used solely for the
transportation of food and freight for while we have
reached the stage where we can at will transmit our
images powers of the senses and personalities it has
yet been found impossible to actually materialize them in
the form of physical matter at the receiving end

  we can sit before our personal sending instrument in
our own home and with a twirling of the dials project

ourselves into any part of the world we desire we can
there be seen by others or remain invisible as we desire
yet all the time we have full consciousness of the things
that are taking place in that locality-sights sounds and
even smells-just as though we stood there in reality

   if you will look up the november issue of a certain
magazine issued in  copies of which can be ob-
tained in the larger libraries you will find therein a
story by a young imaginative author entitled the
scourge of the alphites which deals with miraculous
appearances and disappearances of a peculiar somewhat
human form which later waged a terrible war upon
humanity from a neighboring planet the story tells
in detail of the alphites apparently perfect knowledge
of the plans for defense arranged by humanity and
how the enemy always managed to circumvent our
counterattacks the human race seemed doomed until
an amateur scientist made a discovery that certain elec-
trical impulses shot through the ether could prevent the
appearance of the supernatural ghosts after which the
people of the world found their defenses adequate and
the world was saved	-

   the author of that story little realized how close he
was to the actual truth for at that very time the scien-
tists of that race we now know as the ingols from an
apparent mixture of the old inca and mongol blood
were experimenting along these lines the blending of
those races at some time far back in history had not
only brought out the scientific development of the inca
stock but also the traits of the cruel and power-loving
mongols it was this combination that for a time held
the threat of world domination over us by them

   the final saving of the world was i repeat a purely
accidental discovery





amazing stories

  it was in  that the first threat came at the time
it was not recognized as such but was thought to be a
series of supernatural demonstrations and in the light
of the growing knowledge of the supernatural world
was given but little serious thought

  it was in the same year that word had come from
obscure sources brought to the outer world by indian
runners that an immensely wealthy find of old inca
jewels was made high in the andes plans were im-
mediately started for sending an expedition into that
mountainous region in the interests of science and
treasure

it was in the following year when the expedition
actually got under way that the first real warning
or threat came but at the time it was not recognized as
such

  members of the exploring party had landed on the
south american coast and setting their course from
the city of lima had penetrated a considerable distance
into the mountains where they were suddenly con-
fronted by a regal-appearing chieftain who stopped the
pack train and warned against further progress

  another days march and they were again stopped
and warned and as evidence of their impotency they
were presented with a paper giving extracts of their in-
structions regarding the disposition of the find these
papers had been in the sole possession of the head of
the organization and were supposed to have been kept
absolutely secret

  that evening a conference was held by the expedition
leaders and the following morning the line of march
was suddenly changed but apparently to no effect for
toward evening they were again stopped and a second
paper telling of what had taken place in the previous
nights conference was laid before them added to
that was a still further warning of the dire consequences
that would befall members of the party should they
persist

  not to be daunted and feeling that they were suf-
ficiently armed they nevertheless pushed on and the
world at that time knew only too well the results as
had been promised one man only was allowed to es-
cape that he might carry to the outside world the
warning of the ingols to keep clear of their territory

  naturally the american government would not permit
the atrocity to go unpunished a conference was called
at washington and plans laid to send air and land
punitive forces into the fastnesses when all was finished
and the meeting ready to adjourn a stilted voice spoke
from the air beside them warning that their forces
would never return it is sufficient to state that the
warning was unheeded though it momentarily threw
consternation into the group because the speaker could
not be seen or felt it is also sufficient to add that the
punitive forces never returned

  for nearly two years nothing was heard of the
ingols and people of the world had practically forgotten
their existence the government some time previously
had given up all attempts to reach them

  then the blow fell

  simultaneously during the night hours of september
  the cities of washington new york london
paris and tokio were stricken warning to the out-
side world came through the silence of the telegraph and
telephone an ominous silence that brought forth an in-
stant inquiry from the various world press associations

a few hours later air liners starting for those cities
came driving desperately to outside ports telling hor-
rible tales of an apparently instant death that had
stricken every inhabitant

  a consultation of nations was immediately called to
attempt to ascertain who was the unknown enemy dele-
gates were rushed by plane to a central meeting place at
denver and during their conference the next warning
came

  it was a demand from the unseen voice to instantly
acquiesce to subservience to the ingols failing that dire
consequences were promised naturally the nations re-
fused and perhaps equally naturally the unknown ingol
race inflicted the promised punishment san francisco
shanghai manila and berlin were found three days later
to be cities of the dead

  it was a difficult thing to fight heavy air patrols
were established at every city of importance in the
world but seemed to be of little avail at times the
swooping ships of the enemy would be sighted but
their speed and ability of maneuver were so far ahead
of those modern planes known to civilization that the
latter were helpless

  a patrol would spot the enemy as a dot high in the
sky would attempt to swing to bring their guns to bear
only to find that the speed of the ingol ships was such
that they had struck their blow and were zooming high
out of range before a single retaliatory measure could
be taken

  it is true they did not entirely escape a flight of
nine enemy planes traveling at the  meter level over
dallas texas entered a storm area and upon coming
into clear atmosphere at the far side plunged unex-
pectedly full upon two patrols neither flight had time
to touch a control and the resulting collision wrecked
three of the enemy as well as the two american ships
but the accident brought no results for the wreckage
fell so tangled that nothing of the construction or motive
power of the strangers could be determined save that
they were of a radically new type

  scientists everywhere were working upon the problem
particularly with the view of discovering the means used
by the ingols to project their voices and to learn if
possible whether other senses were projected as well
but their work apparently brought no results

  there was an amateur photographer working on the
portland evening journal who finally furnished the key
he discovered for himself a phenomenon which was
already known by other photographers and opticians
but it was his application of this discovery that pointed
the way to final success

merle aiken and there are many who will rec-
ognize that name now that it is mentioned in this
connection was engaged in making some photographic
copies he had thrown the light of four -watt flood
lamps upon the copyboard and had just brought the
copying camera into focus turning to pick up a plate
holder he accidently struck the ground glass of the
camera shattering it to bits

  the rest of the room was in darkness save for the
diffused reflection from the lamps and aiken stepped to
a shelf on the far side to try to locate a duplicate fo-
cussing plate the shutter of the camera was left open

  he could not find what he was looking for and stop-
ping a moment in puzzlement he happened to glance
toward the camera the thing he saw was a new ex-
when inca-land revolted



perience to him and it was this newness that started him
to thinking where others of greater photographic
knowledge would immediately have recognized it for
what it was and would undoubtedly have passed it by

  there in the clear air where the ground glass had
formerly been was a brilliant image of the picture he
was copying looking a little beyond or a little short of
that particular spot in the air nothing was visible but
with the eyes focussed on the proper plane the picture
was even more brilliant than it would have been with
a glass interceptor

  he studied it a few moments in amazement then
changing the position of the lens a bit he again tried to
pick up the image in the air it was without result
taking a sheet of thin paper he carried it backward
from the camera until the image was clear upon it
marking the place as carefully as he could he again
stepped back into the partially darkened room and at-
tempted to look into space at the point where he had
held the paper instantly the picture was again visible
seeming to stand free in the air some five feet to the
rear of the camera

  calling one of the men working near he asked him to
step before the floodlights placing the lens in front
of him aiken again took his place at the far end of the
room and after a moment there stood his companion in
natural color and with every changing expression of his
face suspended in nothingness

  aiken could scarcely believe his senses it was so
radically new to him taking a ruler he threw it toward
the image naturally it -passed through and beyond
without in any way affecting the brilliance of the air
picture

  aiken also dabbled a little in radio not enough to
thoroughly understand all its principles but enough to
realize something of the unexplored wonders of radio
vibrations

  some days went by with aiken thinking more and
more of the discovery he had made if it was possible
to project an image into nothingness by light why not by
some other form of vibration but of course that had
already been done he suddenly remembered the ex-
periments in radio photography where even moving pic-
tures were transmitted hundreds of miles

  well why not go a bit farther why not hit upon
some wave that could act not only as a sender but a
receiver as well  within limits that had also been done
a telephone transmitter could be used also as a re-
ceiver a radio receiver could be made to oscillate and
send out those horrible howls that so annoyed him when
he was trying to get dx reception true those were
but extremely crude beginnings of the idea he had in
mind but it was just possible that it could be done

  merle aiken had reached that stage in his reasoning
when a second world conference was called at denver
during that meeting the figure of the ingol chieftain was
suddenly seen standing at the side of the delegates table
the place had been well guarded and the diplomats were
stricken dumb with astonishment

  the president of the united states was the first to
recover his equilibrium guards with fixed bayonets
were stationed about the room the president ordered
the ingols arrest bayonets were lowered to on
guard and the sentries advanced the ingol turned and
smiled

  you cannot touch me gentlemen i am not here
he calmly walked through the table and stopped on the

other side the guards attempted to seize him but
struck their own bodies together while he stood an in-
tangible figure in the ether unharmed he spoke again

  gentlemen it is impossible to reach us we are here
yet we are hundreds of miles away in our mountain king-
dom our scientists are far ahead of yours as not only
this phenomenon or miracle as you may perhaps call it
shows you but i would also call your attention to our
ships of the air it is impossible for you to touch them
save by an accident such as happened over your town of
dallas

  many years ago before the beginning of your na-
tion that you call the united states of america the
incas and mongols were great races the mongols left
the south country during the course of time leaving but
a trace of their blood and have drifted far from the
science and teachings that were developed by that people
your archaeologists call the incas

  most of us were wiped out by the early spanish con-
quests and those of other tribes that preceded them
but the more learned of our people took refuge in the
valley of yakuzak there we have lived and studied
for hundreds of years

  we have remembered the wrongs that were done us
our hate is one that does not die the time has come
when ingol-land demands payment every nation on
the face of the earth shall pay tribute to us we shall
establish our governors in every capital the profits of
the world shall be ours and the worship of the one and
true sun-god shall be the religion of the earth

  it is at the instruction of the all powerful sun-god
that we have chosen this time to strike sacrifice is de-
manded sacrifice of twelve beautiful maidens from each
nation each year wealth is demanded wealth to estab-
lish temples of the sun-god throughout the world
power is demanded power to enforce the worship of the
one and true sun-god in all countries

  the ingols eyes glowed with the fires of fanaticism
sending a chilling fear into the hearts of the men listen-
ing to his voice

  shall it be a peaceful conquest will you save the
lives and property of your nations and turn them to the
control of this most humble servant of the sun-god or
shall we be forced to compel obedience

  i have spoken thirty days remain for your answer
then

it is needless to detail the consternation that was felt
by those who heard his voice with his last word
the image vanished how could this power be com-
bated the world already knew only too well how
effective a war by the ingols might be what should
be done

  the entire text of the ingol chieftains speech was
made public and appended to it was a plea for suggestions
that might aid the world in the crisis it was then facing
press dispatches of the episode naturally came to the at-
tention of aiken and his consciousness suddenly clicked

  ive hit it he whispered ive got the idea they
are using but what can i do with it so positive was
he that he sent a telegram to the president telling briefly
his theory of the means used aiken was summoned to
denver and called into conference with the president and
leading radio technicians

  he explained his discovery old to them though the
application was new and it was decided worth trying
what the value might be they could not foresee but if


smazing stories

weve got it fellows weve got iti hastings exulted

they could develop such an
instrument it would at least
enable them to know what
the ingols were doing in
their own country it might
prove the key to unlock
greater things

  days of frenzied work
followed experimenting
with waves of every length
a carrier wave was finally
located that would permit
the projection of an image
and its focus on a predeter-
mined point in the atmos-
phere it was a step but
did not bring the needed re-
sults

  if we could only get
more power at the focal
point and less power in be-
tween we might make the
point of focus serve as a
broadcast station was the
suggestion of george hast-
ings americas leading sci-
entist in radio transmission
but how can we do that
the other scientists worn
out by their continuous
labor could offer no aid
their minds refused to
function

 merle aiken knowing
little of advanced radio had
stood apart throughout the
experiments watching with
bated breath he knew pho-
tography but radio was a
strange plaything to him
however it was photogra-
phy that gave him the next
idea

  listen hastings ive
tried an experiment with
my camera and it worked
maybe you can find some
way to apply it here i set
it up to project an image
then put a prism in the path
of the beam to split it in
two rays a second prism
reflected the beams back
again and by adjusting the
reflecting prisms i once
more brought the image to
a focus the angle of the re-
flecting prisms determining
where the image would be
cast in the air

  with a single beam the
radiation from the ray was
such as to cause a heavy
fog on the plate when i was
attempting to photograph
the image but with the
when inca-land revolted



rays split the carrier beam was invisible while the image
stood out with its original brilliance it photographed
beautifully here see he tendered the picture to
hastings

  the latter studied it a moment then looked off into the
distance

  hm-m-m it may work by heaven i believe youve
hit it aiken here fellows  and he was immediately
engrossed in a hurried explanation of the idea brought
out by aikens experiment technical terms instruc-
tions and suggestions far over the photographers head
left him dizzy and he stepped outside to await further
developments

  the next night hastings called for him were going
to try it want to be there  aiken most certainly did

  the room was darkened a huge screen stood facing
the observers elaborate radio equipment was paneled
beneath it an operator stood tense lightly fingering
the control dials

  between the scientists and the receiving disc some-
what lower down was the sending panel with hastings
at the controls he threw a switch and his body was
bathed in a greenish-yellow light

  ill focus it at a thousand feet on broadway jensen
he spoke to the receiving operator carefully jensen
adjusted the controls the screen slowly took color a
hazy mirage drifting with light and shadow more care-
fully he adjusted the dials and suddenly broadway in all
its splendor of night life snapped upon the screen

  weve got it fellows weve got it hastings ex-
ultant shout startled the observers almost as much as the
scene before their eyes but what followed was even
more surprising people in the near foreground stopped
turned and looked upward directly toward what ap-
peared to be the center of the screen their faces turned
ashen some fainted others fled terror-stricken

  what the   then comprehension came hast-
ings jerked the switch that controlled the peculiar light
bathing him and snapped on the ceiling lights

  somewhat sheepishly he explained i forgot that they
could see me sitting there in the sky and hear me speak
naturally they were scared turning to jensen
lets try it in the mountains this time say on fishers
peak just south of trinidad lets see thats  miles
from here

  again the strange light adjustments by jensen and
the level plateau of the top of the mountain stood before
them more experiments at greater and greater dis-
tances brought corresponding success

  but how to profit by it that was the next question

  listen hastings it was aiken that spoke if
you could find that valley of the ingols we might be
able to see what they are doing and perhaps get an idea

  merle you ought to be a fiction writer every worth-
while idea we have had on this deal has come from you
science may have worked them out but it has been your
imagination that has kept us on the right track here
goes

  turning to jensen he gave instructions to pick him up
at lima peru as a starting point and follow the beam
back through the mountains

  it was but a few minutes work to find the image of
the distant city then rapidly the mountains swept across
the screen under the guiding hands of hastings and
jensen hundreds of miles of mountainous valleys were
swept by -the exploring beam until far in the fastnesses

of the upper andes lights appeared in a precipitous
valley

  slowly the scene seemed to draw near as though the
witnesses were in a plane hovering above the spot

  hastings turned a dial that changed the glow flooding
him from a greenish yellow to a deep violet the scene
on the screen remained unchanged

  that change explained hastings cuts off the
power of making myself visible yet maintains the bril-
liance of the picture lets go down to the ground
jensen

again the scene rose until those in the room seemed

-	to be standing at the earth level people passed
them seemed to walk into the screen and step into
nothingness in the room that fellow must have walked
right through me hastings awed voice muttered

  they located and explored the palace they found the
temple of the sun-god and there witnessed the horrible
sacrifice of one of the maidens

  it was a terrible yet strangely fascinating scene that
played before their eyes the brilliant sunlight playing
over massive masonry and colorful costumes seemed in
contrast to make the scene even more unreal it ap-
peared a bit of wild imagining that might have thrilled
the audience of a movie palace but blanched the faces
of the strong men who in that darkened room were wit-
nessing it they realized only too well how true it was
they could see the mercifully drug-deadened girl beauti-
ful even to the eyes of an anglo-saxon and knew what
was in store for her they would have looked away had
it been possible but they could not they could only
grip the arms of their chairs and struggle for breath as
they watched the terrible scene mirrored on the screen

  a great crowd stood about the open area below the
temple beyond them rose the heavy stonework faced
with a row of squat columns a line of hieroglyphs
inca writing was chiseled across the facade of the

  that means atahualpa-old inca ruler-killed 
of his brothers and drank the blood of other royal rela-
tives-thought it was a charm-wanted to wipe out all
traces of royalty one of the scientists explained in an
awed whisper

  on a great platform of stone extending out from the
middle of the steps leading into the temple there stood
the form of the ingol chieftain already familiar to the
statesmen of the world his body was bare the dark
skin glistening in the sunlight like polished bronze a
jeweled garment hung from his hips chains of jewels and
gold about his neck his haughty head was surmounted
by a lavishly ornamented headdress that seemed to in-
crease his height fully three feet

  on each side of the platform sat groups of ceremonial
musicians with their instruments before them-queer
drums with skin stretched over hoops of wood and some
made of a section of a tree hollowed out into a thin
cylinder copper bells resembling the sleigh bells of the
north rattles made of small shells gourds and nuts
strung together and attached to the ankles and wrists of
the players and cymbal-like instruments of rudimentary
form

  others had wind instruments of reeds in graduated
lengths the reeds held in place by a crosspiece of split
cane and lashed with cords of llama wool cane and bone
flutes and whistles of various kinds


amazing stories

  the chieftain raised his hand two black hooded
priests strode solemnly forward and took their places at
each side of the sacrificial stone

  the music started if it could be called music-a dole-
ful minor tone that gradually grew in volume and wailed
upward in a crazy crescendo of sound it crashed to a
climax and stopped all eyes of the multitude turned
toward the narrow passageway down which the stagger-
ing maiden was being led slowly she mounted the plat-
form and stood while the music again took up its dirge
mysterious rites were performed over her then she was
led to the stone and laid in place the priests advanced
stripping their robes and hoods from their bodies and
stood forth naked their forms horribly caricatured in
flaming paint

  they raised their hands in a final pagan prayer to the
sun then turned again to the fainting girl one stripped
her bosom bare the other raised on high a glittering
golden knife it hung poised an instant then started its
downward sweep   

  the mirror went dark with a gasping cry hastings
had switched off the power it was too terrible to
watch the ceiling lights came on and the men looked at
one another with blanched faces unable to believe what
they had witnessed

  minutes passed while they sat paralyzed by the experi-
ence then with a shudder hastings turned again to the
instrument board and with a change of adjustments set
the screen in operation but he did not go back to the
temple

  they searched the valley and found the plane hangars
with the ships of destruction standing within similar
to our own planes in outward appearance yet somehow
different they stood in long lines

  the wings were much shorter and swooped back-
ward more in the form of a hawks wing on a long
dive they seemed to be connected to the forward end
of the fuselage with a flexible joint that permitted the
entire wing to serve as elevator and rudder though the
tail also carried a rudder vane much like those we knew
but considerably smaller the elevator vanes appeared
about the regular-size

  propellers were missing no propulsive means were
visible unless they lay in a series of small tubes about
the diameter of a  caliber revolver barrel these
tubes were arranged in three sets the largest number
being laid flat along the under surface of the wings
with the openings pointing directly astern a second set
was located in the bottom of the fuselage opening down-
ward and the third set consisting of five tubes was
placed in the nose of each plane being used apparently
as brakes

  later investigations proved that our original supposi-
tion was indeed correct and that the tubes shot forth a
terrible driving charge much on the line of our own
rocket-powered machines save that the ingols had de-
veloped a system of utilizing the breakdown of atomic
structures from which to derive their power

  comparatively little time was spent in the first in-
vestigation for a new danger occurred to jensen if it
was possible for our scientists to pry into the secrets of
the ingols it was equally possible and indeed probable
that the enemys exploring beam would find the labora-
tory accordingly work was interrupted while a
grounded insulating screen was thrown over the build-
ing equipped with movable apertures to permit the out-

going beam to pass yet which would prevent most of the
danger of discovery by the ingols their beam would
be effectively insulated and pass into the ground should it
strike the building unless by some chance it happened
to touch the exact spot where the two-foot opening al-
lowed the passage of our own carrier wave

tt was at this stage of the game that the period of
a thirty days grace expired representatives of the
nations were gathered in conference awaiting the ap-
pearance of the ingol it had been decided that should
an extension of time be refused nothing could be done
but acquiesce for only by seeming to agree could a
wholesale slaughter be averted

  hastings jensen aiken and a group of the scientists
were in the laboratory a few minutes before the inter-
national conference was called to order the instru-
ments were adjusted and focussed on the throne room
of the ingol chieftain

  there they saw a similar equipment to their own
before the sending apparatus stood the warrior march-
ing up and down presently he stopped and the strange
light bathed him also

  a slight change of adjustment and the spectators in the
denver laboratory appeared to be standing behind the
chieftain looking as he did toward the oval receiving
screen on that screen they saw pictured the conference
in the capitol building they saw the ingol smile a
cynical smile at the harassed expressions on the faces of
the diplomats

  the scientists sat silent listening to the words of the
ingol spoken in his stilted english and to the replies of
the president who served as spokesman for the nations

  your answer do you choose submission or death

  honorable ingol we have considered you and your
race among the highest of ancient civilizations stated
the president evasively the knowledge of your ex-
istence and powd- comes as a surprise to us we recog-
nize our inability to cope with your superior knowledge
but there has not yet been time to notify all peoples of
the world we ask for an extension of time for an-
other thirty days if such should meet with your ap-
proval

  the ingol glanced sharply from one to the other his
glance showing the suspicion he felt those in the
laboratory saw his image in ingol-land turn from the
screen and look toward his advisors and sub-chieftains
the appearance of the ingol in the conference room
must have been as though he was looking off into the
distance considering the proposition he nodded his
head apparently in thought the diplomats looked re-
lieved but those in the laboratory saw helmeted figures
hurriedly rise and leave the chamber disappearing down
a corridor

  the ingol turned again toward the president we
shall consider it but at the first sign of retaliation on
your part death will rain down upon you the chief-
tains screen went dead and he turned with a cynical
smile toward his throne

  quick jensen the air field spoke hastings again
the planes came into view rolling slowly into the open
under the star-studded sky of that far land they hesi-
tated a moment as they took formation then swiftly rose
almost vertically with a faintly luminous blast of the
power tubes showing beneath and astern of the ships

  into the leading plane jensen
when inca-land revolted



  the scene changed and showed the interior of the
speeding fighting machine a half dozen dark-skinned
men were swiftly yet surely placing equipment in posi-
tion short mortar-shaped guns of some sort were
being trained through openings in the floor their
breeches were charged with a powdery substance and
wire connections made to a control board before which
another figure sat watching a multitude of gauges and a
reflecting plate equipped with hairlines which showed
him the territory over which they were flying a dupli-
cate plate before the pilot coupled with telephonic com-
munication between the two men enabled instant co-
ordination when in the stress of battle control of the
plane seemed to be with the operator at the firing board
orders being issued by him to other members of the
crew 

  on the screen in denver a tense group watched the
flight of the enemy planes in their own viewing plate
they could see the image of the ground beneath the ship
as reflected in the latters plate sweeping steadily
north the plane crossed the vast mountain ranges al-
most with the speed of sound it seemed soon the
gulf showed below then presently land again hast-
ings announced it must be texas the plane which was
the flight leader for the squadron apparently was taking
a direct course for denver

  as soon as the course was ascertained hastings called
the president and advised immediate evacuation of the
city in as quiet a manner as possible to prevent needless
deaths should the ingols fail to abide by the agreement

an army officer of the anti-craft division of the

-	field artillery was a member of the interested
audience watching the flight of the enemy planes to
him the next idea of importance came

  it was granted that even being able to discover the
means by which the strange planes were driven it would
still be impossible to construct ships that could meet
them in battle within the short length of time left before
a definite answer must be given the worlds hope
must be pinned on some type of offensive defense
something that apparently was purely for the protection
of civilized peoples yet something that would at the
same time strike a telling blow at the heart of the ingol
stronghold

  distances from the valley of yazutak were so great
that a land expedition was not feared any attack that
the ingols would make would of necessity come from the
air and naturally any defense or offensive movement
would have to be made through the air

  mr hastings spoke major eberling white i
have an idea if you can supply your end of it can you
give me by watching the interior of that ship there the
course elevation and speed that it is making

  hastings glanced at the viewing plate he saw pic-
tured on it the instruments of the pilot saw that the
plane at that time was following a compass course of
n--w saw that the speed indicator registered a sym-
bolic figure that was easily translated through timing its
flight over known cities into  miles an hour placed
its elevation in a third instrument

  yes major i can

  umm-m-m well hastings can you tell me at any
given instant just exactly where the plane is in relation
to points on a large scale map

  not now major but when it is in familiar territory

where i can place myself in her firing finder i can give
you the exact location

  i notice hastings that except in actual battle per-
haps the ship seems to hold a fairly even course and
speed it might be possible to compute thirty seconds in
advance exactly where she would be yes um-m-m it
most certainly would the major seemed to be talking
more to himself than to the others

  that being so should they fly within range of our
new anti-aircraft guns and keep under  meters it
would be quite possible to bracket them and ra all
probability bring them down umm-m-m quite so
the major thought in silence for a moment while the
others watched him anxiously quite evidently he had
an idea that might prove of vital importance

  umm-m-m i say hastings how long will it be be-
fore these planes are over denver

  about an hour and three-quarters major they are
in the central part of texas now

  good major white stepped rapidly across to the
phone and called his battery send plotters and instru-
ments to the laboratory immediately man the guns and
upon order fire as per directions from me in groups of
four it will require every ounce of speed you can put
into it for there are five ships and we have  guns two
sets will have to fire twice all with perfect hits before
they can bring their planes to bear or we shall be wiped
out it is the only chance

  again the major called central maintain these lines
open to battery c with absolutely no interference no
matter what the apparent urgency major eberling
white speaking    very good thank you

  a few minutes later the sound of speeding motorcycles
drew near and a moment after a half dozen tense-faced
young officers stepped into the room tables were
quickly arranged under the direction of the major and
instructions given to hastings to compute the distance
apart and form of flight the enemy planes were holding

  if we can fire within  feet we can bring them
down with those new shells their explosive range is
terrific    got it hastings

  yes major v formation  degree angle planes
spaced  feet

  the major was evidently highly elated good one
battery may bring down more than one plane captain
grayson speaking to the officer in charge of the plot-
ting crew you will compute for firing at thirty second
intervals mr hastings will give you the necessary de-
tails there must be no mistake

  yes sir captain grayson turned to the men and
apportioned their duties then to hastings and got the
starting point at which it seemed the planes would enter
the extreme range this was plotted on the map
major white turned to the phone and gave terse instruc-
tions to the firing officer

  lieutenant you will train all guns to one setting
firing them in groups of four at one-third second inter-
vals instantly stand by for change in range and on in-
struction fire again in the same order battery firing will
be automatic at thirty-second intervals after your first
order clear    very good

five minutes later hastings informed captain gray-
son that the planes were approaching the range line
he gave the elevation speed and course a moment
later he gave the line of crossing the predetermined area


amazing stories

   instantly the five men at the table sprang into feverish
activity captain grayson stood tense holding the phone
which the major had released to him his eyes on the
watch he spoke swiftly into the transmitter

  stand by fire in  seconds the plotting of-
ficers reported their computations the captain instantly
repeating them into the phone range  elevation
   quadrant    ready-fire

  simultaneously with his command men standing at
the windows looking toward the location of the bat-
teries saw thin lines of flame shoot heavenward followed
a few moments later by groups of blinding flashes high
in the skies seconds afterward the reverberations of
those rending concussions came to their ears muffled
by distance

  meanwhile the captain was again speaking range
 elevation    spread quadrant five de-
grees centering   in that thirty seconds the
enemy planes had time to travel almost three and a half
miles and were now a little east of the batteries and
practically directly overhead again came the flash of
the firing interrupted by hastings excited shout

  four of them the first time the view had been
set back so that the entire group might be seen the
leader is wobbling half a wing is gone he is coming
down tight spiral to keep right side up oh-h-h a
blinding flash had come from the bottom of the plane
and hastings realized it meant the firing of the ingols
deadly guns on the area beneath them captain hell
land in segment -k

  hello firing officer barrage battery-gas --k
at will the plane had scarcely landed in the area of
death before the shells of the barrage began falling
the plane was not struck though the ground all about it
was torn into deep craters a half dozen shells had
landed and members of the crew of the fighting plane
could be seen to drop to the ground unconscious from
the effects of the stupefying gas the captain ordered
cease firing and instructed a detail to enter the area
and capture any of the enemy yet living

  the first raid was ended

  the actual capture of the two stupefied men remain-
ing alive after the crash needs little comment it can be
found in detail in the average school history of today
the plane itself as well as the others of the flight were
so wrecked as to be useless for scientific study as to
their construction

the army men and those others gathered in that
darkened room naturally anticipated immediate
retributioif from the ingol chieftain and laid plans ac-
cordingly they could not hope for the same luck on
the next invasion for undoubtedly to their way of
thinking the flight had been watched even as they had
watched it and adequate care would be taken to prevent
a recurrence of the surprise

  as it turned out however the ingols had not dreamed
of a catastrophe of this sort and had no knowledge of the
fate their fliers had met moreover they were unable to
locate the wreckage under the camouflage and so it was
not until several days had elapsed that they became cer-
tain that the planes were gone even then they were
not aware of the means by which the defeat had been
brought about

  in the meantime figuring that a second flight would
follow approximately the same course as the first until

comparatively near their destination the army authorities
had established their guns much farther to the south
beyond the line at which the ingol planes would probably
begin to change courses should they be suspicious as to
what had befallen their earlier companions

  this new location was connected by direct phone lines
with the laboratory and arrangements made for dupli-
cating the first victory should that be at all possible

  meanwhile jensen and hastings had kept the view
plate tuned on the airfield in ingol-land and had taken
turns sleeping so that a full -hour watch might be
maintained

  it was early on the fourth day with jensen on watch
that warning of the second raid came

  the stately ingol had appeared but once the evening
before when his form became apparent to the statesmen
convened in the conference hall reports of those pres-
ent stated his appearance was terrible to see he had
been visible but a moment and had spoken but few words
we have received your answer you shall kneel before
my throne and beg for mercy that we shall not grant
then he was gone

  immediately evacuation of denver and the neighbor-
ing cities started and army preparations reached a
frenzied pitch false leads of air activity were apparent
everywhere intended to divert the attention of the ingols
who it was known would be watching

  meanwhile a third line of defense was being arranged
for the extreme southern edge of texas this was to
remain silent during the next anticipated flight and would
be called into action only in case of a third punitive
expedition

  nine enemy planes took off just at sunrise their
course was closely watched by those in the laboratory
and once again unbelievable good fortune came to the
american gunners seven of the ships were brought
down at the first burst the other two wriggled through
but their propelling mechanism was so damaged that they
were forced to descend and were captured with the ships
in fairly good condition

  prior to this crated plane parts for ships of the
speediest type were en route from san francisco to the
coast of peru on board a specially chartered and rebuilt
tramp steamer to all appearances this vessel had no
connection with the army or navy forces of the allied
governments but seemed to be nothing but a wandering
rust-covered and unpainted vagabond of the seas

  below deck however crews of mechanics were hur-
riedly unpacking and assembling these planes into ef-
fective fighting units portholes had been shaded and
the entire working area screened against the prying ray
of the ingol personality projector as a safeguard against
detection forced draft ventilators enabled the men to
work in comfort and even tune up the motors so they
would instantly be ready to take the air at a signal from
the president

  this vessel which had steamed at full power until
near the canal zone was at this time lolling easily
through the seas under bare steerage way to prevent the
necessity of having to lay over for a suspicious length of
time off the peruvian coast

  a check-up from the laboratory on the ingol airfield
showed five planes only remaining it was a possibility
that jothers lay hidden somewhere but hastings and
jensen thought it unlikely for every nook and cranny
had been thoroughly investigated apparently the
when inc aland revolted



ingols had felt that their ships were invincible and the
comparatively small number already captured wrecked
and in reserve had constituted their entire fleet

immediately after the destruction of the second
flight of planes hastings had ordered the view plate
turned on the ingol palace there had been no time to
check on the activities of the chieftain during the actual
raid but following the crashes and destruction of the
enemy ships an inspection of the throne and assembly
rooms there showed the surprise and consternation with
which the unexpected reversal had been received

  an element of fear and uncertainty seemed to be
registered on the faces of the leaders also there was a
fanatical light of almost crazy determination in the eyes
of the high chieftain

  they seemed to fear the risk of losing the balance of
their fleet yet there was no other way by which they
might bring the war into the borders of the allied na-
tions they reached their decision shortly after mid-
night of the day of their second failure

  those in the laboratory watched the flyers again roll
out the planes and make preparations for a third expe-
dition warning was sent to the sea tramp rolling idly
in the waves fifty miles off shore to stand by a mo-
ments switch of the view mirror to that point showed
the huge hatch being removed and the false super-
structure of the after deck being dumped into the sea
which revealed a take-off and landing platform beneath
it

  the ingol planes took to the air and immediately an
order went to the tramp their booms speedily lifted
the allies planes to the deck and one by one they took to
the air also circling about the mother ship until the
formations were complete then headed through the early
morning darkness toward the seacoast far to the east

  no one knows what the plans of the ingol chieftain
were and there will probably never be any way to learn
them now evidently he underestimated the resource-
fulness of the allied nations in establishing undiscovered
the third and farthest-flung line of defense for the ingol
machines again followed the course of the first two
flights until the coast of texas was reached perhaps
he had ordered those five planes to pick up that well-
known landmark then change their courses to avoid
danger whatever the orders the five planes flew un-
suspectingly into the danger zone and once again the first
salvo from the hidden guns brought the ships to earth
despite the fact that last instant corrections of the eleva-
tion had to be made due to a sudden zoom of the man-
birds at the rate they were zooming another ten
seconds would have placed them safely beyond the reach
of the allied guns but the result remained the same-
they were brought down to earth as had been their pred-
ecessors

  immediately this was done hastings ordered the al-
lied planes picked up they were found just entering
the mountain regions back of lima turning his voice
into the ship of the flight leader hastings gave detailed
instructions for the course to be followed until the hid-
den valley should be reached the panes were then to
cirele at  meters until hastings again returned
with further instructions

  the viewplate was then turned on the ingol palace
and once again found there not only fear but consterna-
tion a great mob of the natives milled about the outer

area the chieftain and his lieutenants were gazing hor-
ror-stricken on the scene of the last crash their plate
showed the tangled masses of wreckage and the throngs
of people circling about them

  hastings snapped the switch that changed the light
flooding him from deep violet to the greenish-yellow
the vibration that made his person visible and his voice
audible

  high chieftain he spoke the group whipped
about and gazed awe-stricken at the sudden apparition
high chieftain the time of reckoning has come i
speak on instruction of our president your planes are
down and it is our turn to demand submission

  we didnt want this war you brought it on your-
selves that we have penetrated many of your secrets
is our good fortune and your loss our war planes are
now circling above you submit or 

  the chieftain seized a small weapon at his belt pat-
terned along the principle of the already familiar plane
mortars he fired it pointblank at the figure of hastings

  the latter involuntarily ducked-the thing was so
realistic then he suddenly realized the impossibility of
being injured and his mocking laugh rang through both
the laboratory and the ingol council chamber

  be back in five minutes chief he remarked then
turning to jensen back to our planes they were
picked up almost immediately and in the early light of
the morning hastings gave instructions to bomb the air-
field which was then practically deserted the planes
circled and headed for the hangars beneath them a
moment later three speeding dark objects hurtled down-
ward from the first three ships of the flight a few
seconds later great flashes of light and clouds of smoke
and dust welled upward from the area where the hangars
had stood

  hold it captain instructed hastings back to the
ingols he said to jensen

  the scene again changed and once more the watchers
saw the group of weirdly clad enemy leaders

  thats a sample stated hastings to the group before
him whats the answer peace or death they
looked from one to another as the chieftain translated the
message for those who could not understand the
high chieftain suddenly seemed to have lost his proud
and haughty bearing and appeared a bent and broken old
man he turned back from his men and made the sign
of peace hands raised with the palms outward

  your demands his voice quavered as a man
suddenly stricken

  that is up to the allied nations well land a repre-
sentative in one of our planes others will continue to
circle above you and a single move of treachery will
bring about the death of every one of your tribe

  it is well he will be received the ingol an-
swered

  one of the planes slowly dropped to the airfield and
came to rest the others continuing their guard patrol

that about finished the story we all know today
that peace was established we know how the
wealth of the tribe was placed at the disposal of the
world to rehabilitate the places wrecked in the early
raids today the valuable mines are handled under the
direction of the allied nations the ingols have lost
much of their pomp and glory as always happened to a


amazing stories

conquered people and the horrible sacrifices to the sun
have been done away with by international mandate

  the scientific discoveries of the ingols have been made
available to the world at large and the nations of the
world have placed at the disposal of the ingols their dis-
coveries peace and harmony have finally been
reached which was in reality the aim of the ingol chief-
tain now long dead but it was done with a greater
mutual benefit than would have been possible under the
plan of conquest outlined by him

  but one thread remains to be gathered

  merle aiken the man who made possible the saving
of the world through his early researches and who
through his lack of technical knowledge was forced to
stand by as a mere onlooker during the later develop-
ments was granted the highest honorary award ever
given by the allied nations his bust sculptured by the

famous french artist plaisson holds the place of honor
in the international hall and his name is recorded in
every history of those troublous days

  his own nation through the president and his cabi-
net opened up the government laboratories to him and
under the expert tutelage of the scientists in charge gave
him the start which made him in later years one of the
greatest of all scientists the man to whom we are in-
debted today for many of the greatest inventions of the
modern world

  merle aiken now stands in the mind of every boy and
girl as the ultimate model from which to pattern ones life
he is one of the few heroes who will live through the
years not only as a savior of the world but as one of the
greatest benefactors in the world of science that has ever
been known

there were four minutes left at most before the auto-

hamilton commenced a rapid search for the plans which
had been the cause of all the trouble he found them

engine room to wait

hamilton in an endeavor to understand strau-
bers insane dash into the storm and with a curi-
osity concerning this man whose orbit had crossed his
own so briefly-so briefly in fact that he had never
even seen him-questioned the morose prisoner from
his crude answers he pieced out the melancholy story
of a brilliant mind hounded by real and imagined misfor-
tune till it turned from the practice of science to that
of crime the man was undoubtedly an extreme para-
noic and in his discharge from the services of s p b
hamilton having filled his position had seen the cul-
mination of a series of malicious designs on himself
accordingly he had devoted the last of his energy and
resources to this attempt which would be his revenge
against the great mining organization and also the re-
cuperation of his sunken fortunes

  the scheme was cleverly worked out but it had failed
because of the completely unlooked for move on the
part of the crew of the boanerges but for that move
which wrecked the criminals motor sled strauber and
his men would be forging their way through the storm
to their concealed plane with the valuable plans of the
ionic separator stowed away his next move would have
been of course to sell them to international met as his

warm port oil-feed manifold and listened to the whistling
of the wind at least i am indebted to strauber for a
thrilling story to tell my grandchildren-when these will

editor amazing stories

   may i offer some diversified observations upon
the contents of your february  issue it
was a chance copy which i found i believe your
magazine is not regularly on sale in this country

   with regard to the fourth dimension your
editorial footnote treats it as purely a mathe-
matical abstraction which as far as the ordinary
person is concerned is for amusement only a
recent review in nature attempted to answer the
question of what are the practical uses of multi
dimensional geometry the review instanced the
statistical work of dr r a fisher chief statis-
tician at rothamsted experimental station har-
penden and author of statistical methods for
research workers dr fishers work is based
in many cases upon n-dimensional space and the
application of statistics to say the counting of
bacteria upon six parallel plates may be regarded
as a re-projection into our three-dimensional space-
continuum of a five-dimensional occurrence if
five plates are in question there are four degrees
of freedom or in other words four dimensions
the investigation of garden soil may therefore
bring the fourth dimension right to our doors

   after reading your praise of wes so as a star
artist it was rather a shock to find that such a
brilliant illustrator of scientific tales should have
the same idea of a bio-chemical laboratory as has
the ordinary advertisement artist the chemical
retort and the footed glass may be said to be
extinct except in the imagination of such artists
who invariably proceed on the lines that no
laboratory is complete without one moreover
the shapes and dispositions they adopt are such as
would never be adopted by any chemist i notice
a number of other details but i do not intend
niggling criticisms i do not ask that wes so be
an expert chemist for if he were that he could
hardly be an illustrator as well i do suggest
however that he might get well ahead of other
artists who have these funny notions of retorts
especially should a scientific artist have a good
sense of proportion about his apparatus

   the author of into the valley of death is
quite right about the toughness of manganese steel
which until recently could not be machined last
july i watched some special trackwork for street-
car lines being ground punched and drilled at
works of the messrs edgar allen  co ltd
sheffield england these are specialists in man-
ganese steel but the discovery is so recent that
mr pringle is not to be blamed for not having
heard of it

   i liked your editorial on discs some time ago
i -wrote an article on a hole in a piece of paper
which resembled your article in general treatment
in conclusion may i say that it is evident that
the editing of the magazine is in capable hands
the editor seems well able to curb effectively the
juvenilities of some of his correspondents

   one of the tragedies of the work of our edi-
torial staff has been to get artists to illustrate our
stories if you will watch the work of mr wesso
and mr morey we think you will conclude that
we are rather fortunate in finding two such good
men your statement about manganese steel js
interesting where trolley cars have to turn at
corners of streets and the like the greatest diffi-
culty was experienced in former times from the
way they would wear out the frogs the friction
was so great at these points now expensive steel
is being used and the passerby can see where it
is in use by the different aspect of its surface it
is brighter and lighter in color than the ordinary
rail we are so proud of our correspondence
column that we feel that we add to its gayety
in putting in the juvenilities as you term them

    the loch loverns masts
editor amazing stories

   i have just been reading mr verrills non-
gravitational vortex in the june issue may i
write you a letter about it like any other reader

   swell story but what i want to take a poke at
is the artless illustration by morey both on the
cover and on the first page of the story the
loch lovem k represented as a steam yacht
not a very well found one either to judge by
her bows while on page  near the top you
will find the following in mr verrills story-
to him life began with the hours of his recovery
aboard the loch lovem sir esmes ocean-going
yacht a splendid five-masted bark for sir eeme
was a true sailor and had no use for steam
where oh where is the five-master and on
page - sir esme himself is shown-with his
waistcoat buttoning right over left a thing so
mans waistcoat ever does even in england

   morey is usually pretty good i like his pic-
tures better than pauls but he pulled a couple
of boners this time

the masts of the loch lovem as to the waist-

sartorial profession nor an authority on fashion

   now for the stories

   the january  issue as a whole was ex-
cellent the best stories were when the
atoms failed fourth dimensional space pene-
trator the hungry guinea pig the sword
and the atopen and the first omithopter

   in the new may issue hamilton makes the
mistake of declaring neptune to be the outer-
most of the planets in the solar system because
planet x has just been discovered

  of course-

   if the force-ray was emanating from neptune
and striking the sun wouldnt that tend to push
neptune away from the sun

   the other stories are very good except through
the veil the ivy war was great the
pea vine mystery and the dead sailor were
very interesting have some more of those

 in the april issue campbell jr throws mil-
lions and billions about like baseballs one
million spaoe-ships lost never mind we can
make a billion in one hour but it was a swell
story have some more by him and dont for-
get julian kendig jr either a sequel to his

yet it was absolutely terrible i certainly do not
see anything in a h verrill he isnt much
good hes too much inclined for wordiness
as is h g wells piracy preferred was no
good on account of too many explanations that
ruined the whole man and his works i hope you
wont have any more stories by these authors

  im glad to see david a speaker in the next
issue hold on to him sayl ray cummings
murray leinster victor rousseau and other

why my editor cant we also this new maga-

the old-timers then why cant we

  what has become of harl vincent he always
wrote well what has become of a merritt
he was another old master

  and when do we get the promised sequel to
the face in the abyss and when do we
get a sequel to the moon strollers and how
about going through space with the characters of
the most marvelous the green girl and
how about some more by r f starzl his
madness of the dust was great also i havent
seen anything of victor rousseau at all since i
have been reading a s why dont we get
something by this popular author

  another author that i agree with your readers
is no good is dr  he simply does
not know how to make an interesting story with
a good plot to it nothing you say can change
that because it is the truth

  if you wont give us something by the old
timers you can at least reprint some of their
stories as the moon pool the face in the
abyss people of the pit by a merritt
tarrano the conqueror the man on the
meteor around the universe by ray cum-
mings how about it mad planet and red
dust by murray leinster or why not reprint
his stories from the argosy the darkness on
fifth avenue the city of the blind the
storm that had to be stopped as the last
two are sequels to the first why not reprint them in

he appears in the june issue piracy pre-

winning a name for himself harl vincent is
still with us and we shall soon give you a story
by him we absolutely disagree with you about
dr kellers work he is a highly educated special-
ist and has the knack of giving the much de-

action and reaction-the rocket
in a vacuum and in air
editor amazing stories

  although your stories are fiction and meant to
entertain and not to teach it is not a good idea to
let your authors implant erroneous ideas in the
brains of the coming generation of scientists
our proteges not only might they dream many
dreams founded on principle unsubstantiated set
forth in your publication-dreams are often the
conception of invention-but they might also work
on a theory based on such a fact 

  an example of what i am attempting to
delineate is that principle of rocket ships etc
which requires or at least is aided by the pres-
sure of the released gases on a semi-stationary ob-
ject in order to attain the forward motion so es-
sential to its progress

  the forward motion is obtained in a rocket
ship it is true by the expulsion of gases but
its explanation depends not on the above principle
with all due apologies to the promulgators of that
most honored idea but upon the word and mathe-
matics of a scientist of some few decades ago
his name was isaac newton and the words he
used to explain the rocket vehicles action were
action and reaction are equal and opposite
perhaps you have not heard of this man it is
true much of his works are obscure to many
people and since the repeal of the law of
gravitation attributed to einstein a popular
modern who however only added a rider to
the bill newton has been more obscured than
ever

  back to the former subject and a comparison
action and reaction are equal and opposite what
happens to the cannon ball after it is shot from
the cannon does not affect the recoil of the cannon
in any way whether it is shot against a wall five
feet away or on paris  miles away likewise a
fireman holding the nozzle of a hose with a stiff
stream of water issuing from same does not feel
more pressure from it when he holds it against
a stone wall than when he sprays a bed of
flowers with the same stream

  these two parallels might tend to help the fact
trickle into the minds of some of your authors
only some i say and some of your arid corre-
spondents one might say arid that your rocket
and ray machines cannot be helped on their
journey by what their propelling force strikes
after it has left the machine that is a rather
broad statement however and one might well
invent a reflective impulse that worked both ways
for a story

  your stories again are chosen to entertain
rarely do they show clear presentation of ideas in
idiomatic english a command of the language
is perhaps not necessary in these days but it is
still a graceful asset to any writer in literature
this has often been called a sterile age such a
period is usually referred to as decadent aside
from the school of biographers at present it is a
sterile age and biography of all constructive
literature comes closest to the sterile but pardon
the digression on such an unimportant subject no
one pays any attention to it nowadays

                        doan oxlla

one of the charter members s c c

	beck hall cambridge mass

  a rocket would go better in a vacuum than
in the air and the air has nothing to do whatever
with pushing it forward we thought that our
readers had been told this a number of times
we are inclined to agree with what you say about
this being a sterile age and that sometimes the
trouble with modern biographies seems to be that
they are perhaps too picturesque but the work of
such authors as strachey and maurois are very
good reading ludvig it sometimes seems to the
writer goes too far in striving for picturesque-
ness perhaps our sterile age might be called
the age of biographies and of best sellers-

        by a hyatt verrill
 a complete scientifiction novelette
 combined with an archaeological
 treatise an amazing invention in
 the form of a certain ray reproduces
 actual living monsters and beings
 of pre-incans - scenes that are
 stored in the light rays that visited
 the earth thousands of years ago

  then too i am enabled to have the possession
of a collection of the works of an author who
has made for himself an enviable reputation as a
writer of scientifiction

  and now to throw my hat into the ring

  i have been intensely interested in the dis-
cussions anent the nullification of gravity i for
one do not agree with the theory that has been
advanced that by the use of a gravity screen
namely that after the elapse of a certain period
of time all the earths atmosphere would be
thrown off into space

  air has the uncanny property of being able to
adapt itself to almost any condition and further-
more it is not affected by any of the contrivances
in continual use viz radio telegraphy airplanes
etc

   then too it has the ability of replenishing itself
apparently without the use of any outside agency
maintaining a constant pressure no matter how
many oxygen-consuming elements may be operat-
ing at a given time in a given space

  and also air evidently is not attracted by
gravitation for if it were the atmospheric band
would have hardly any height and the pressure
at the surface of the earth would be enormous

   under such conditions therefore the air above
any gravity screen would be as unaffected as a
human hand resting on the asbestos covering of
a furnace running full blast

  contrary to most contributors to the writers
column i wish to say that of all the stories in your
magazine i have read i have yet to read one that
wasnt entertaining clear through

  of course some stories stand out above others
and among these i list the non-gravitational
vortex which gives the most plausible explana-
tion yet of the disappearance of nungesser and
coli piracy preferred is the type of story that
strikes me as being just right

  lets have more like after  years
the undersea tube and a baby on neptune
roland l hansen

      mohawk street los angeles calif

  we think you are substantially right in some
of your views but air is attracted by gravitation
without gravitation the earth would soon be de-
prived of its atmosphere the author of piracy
preferred while a scientist of high order is able
to unbend for popular-story writing without
being dry or pedagogical his stories are very
instructive the disappearance of nungesser and
coli is one of those sad mysteries which bids fair
to remain a mystery for many years it probably
will never be solved it is certainly a compliment
to amazing stories to have a high school teacher
speak of it as your friend did mr campbell
will we hope continue to write for us for
many years as regards the ocean-going yacht
we have to succumb she should have had five
masts there is science in the feathered de-
tective in the division of ornithology-editor

   present knowledge is not
complete knowledge
editor amazing stories

  i have been reading your monthly and quarterly
magazines for a long time i have seen but one
story the white army that rates mention
in the whole of the time that i have read the
magazines but you are not to be condemned se-
verely for that as the percentage of good stories
in your recently brought-out competitors is equally
low

   is it not possible for scientifiction to be written
that does not flatly contradict some things that are
definitely established scientifically or that do not
follow one of but two or three general patterns so
closely as to give the reader an uncanny feeling
of having read that very story before or that the
author does not invent some implement in the
future that we have already or that does not en-
dow with existence pure mathematical concepts
th th etc dimensions

   it is common for gravity screens or nullifiers to
be employed in the stories yet such things are
absolutely contrary to present knowledge even
repulsive matter or substances are spoken of

  scientifiction may be classed as follows with
the stories in each group monotonously alike
interplanetary sub-atomic historical mayer and
authern and biological and fourth-dimensional
as a class the biological stories are the least
answerable to this criticism and the interplanetary
stories the worst offenders

  in nearly every type of story some machine
or some force which we now have is invented
and given powers which would to say the least
surprise those most familiar with it as a shining
example of this witness in explorers of cal-
listothe paralyzing of human beings and inducing
a fever at a distance by the use of the radiations

been better

editor amazing stories

  as a student of astronomy i am very pleased
to say that i find entertaining diversion enter-
tainment and worth-while facts from astronomical
and interplanetary stories which appear regularly
in your magazine but above all-entertainment

  among the more recent of this type verrills
noteworthy non-gravitational vortex should be
mentioned verrill has a way of making a story
life-like and at the same time well saturated with
scientific facts it is a strange fact that two
days after i read the above mentioned story a
tornado tore its way a few miles north of here
causing widespread damage this recalls to
mind verrius statement about vortices being
caused by intelligences on other planets evi-
dently some individual intelligence stationed on
some one of our far-flung nine planets deemed it
amusing to toss one of these vortices in my direc-
tion just by way of letting me know that such
did exist his aim however was rather poor i

   well enough of such piffle i shall immediately
get down to brass tacks and outline my reason
for writing

  interested as i am in amateur astronomy i
would like very much to get in touch with others
of a kindred interest and correspond regularly
with them especially in the line of meteoric
astronomy and auroral and zodiacal light ob-
servations

  there must be in this wide world hundreds if
not thousands of persons interested in astronomy
and anxious to do something for science in this
line if said persons would drop me a line or
report any meteors or aurora which they have
observed casually or otherwise i would be very
thankful also i am as much interested in
corresponding with persons who watch regularly
for meteor showers and who have obtained data
on the subject

  the following are important showers which
give many meteors an hour these are all to be
seen in the eastern sky

   deiat aquarids july - inclusive perseids
fine annual shower aug - inclusive orio-
noids october - inclusive seen only after
midnight lenoids nov - inclusive after
midnight only and the geminids of dec -
inclusive complete the important meteoric dis-
plays for the current year on which i would be
more than glad to hear from as many persons
situated at -widely separated points as possible
and if there are any amateur astronomers in my
own vicinity i should be only too glad to assist
them in getting started of the above dates
july th aug th oct st nov ith-th
and dec th are those on which most meteors
will be seen and reports pertaining to hourly
rates of all meteors seen are most valuable as
they give us an idea as to the relative thickness
and orbits of these meteor swarms we know
for instance that the perseid stream must be very

thick for it takes the earth between fifteen and
twenty days to get through it varying at dif-
ferent years depending on the thickness of the
swarm at that place and by investigation into the
hourly rate we find the thickness at all points of
the stream consequently the more observations we
have the better

  the perseids will unfortunately be somewhat
spoiled by bright moonlight this year but i will
be very glad to receive observations from anyone
interested on any night of the year

  in observing the exact time of beginning ob-
servations and ending should be noted and ob-
servations of under one hour are of little value
two to four hour stands are preferable and an
account of the condition of the sky should be
noted such as-clouds passing through ursa
major and draco - or haze inter-
fering at times etc this is essential if we arc
to gauge the hourly rate accurately and if the
sky is hazy or even partly cloudly or with more
than a half-moon observations are inadvisable as
so few are seen

  if the observer is familiar with the constella-
tions the path of the meteor if well-seen should
be noted such as-from half a degree above
alpha tauri to a point midway between mu and
nu tauri and on a blank the color brightness
color of train if any and duration and other
interesting peculiarities such as a train of sparks
or a two-headed meteor etc

  as to the brightness or magnitude of a meteor
or fireball the full moon is reckoned at  the
half-moon  venus  jupiter  sirius  and
two magnitudes down the scale voga and capella
arc reckoned at about  aldebaran alpha cygni
and antares at  and the stars in the orion belt
at  from this standard scale the reader may
continue on down for himself the th magni-
tude is the absolute limit of naked-eye vision and
the average meteor is rd or th magnitude while
beginners invariably overestimate brightness and
duration both the average meteor exists about
half a second although different showers average
differently the august perseids often leave
trains for  to  seconds

  we are very glad to publish your very inter-
esting communication which will be welcomed by
so many of our readers we would suggest the
correspondence club to you as a source for
correspondents for many of the members are
interested in astronomy from time to time we
publish correspondence referring to work which its
members are doing-editor

 the proton electron and the
atom
editor amazing stories

  ever since the change of editors i have been
an ardent pursuer of amazing stories it is un
doubtedly the best magazine of its type issued

  in the may issue all of the stories were good
madness of the dust by r f starzl ranked
far above the others besides being cleverly
written it had an interesting plot which seemed
to flow along of its own accord

  i certainly approve of a large number of
artists since it gives one a variety of different
types of drawing of all the artists i consider
wesso and morey the best

  i have never understood the relation between
the atom electron and proton i would be very
grateful if you would explain it
i would also be grateful if any reader having
back numbers of the amazing stories which he
would like to sell would write to me

the atom has been theorized about for many
centuries the electron is supposed to be the
smallest quantity of negative electricity that can
exist the proton is supposed to be the smallest
quantity of positive electricity that can exist it
follows that the protons and electrons have the
highest affinity and attraction for each other the
atom is supposed to consist of a nucleus built up
of protons generally with a definite number of
electrons bound into it these are called the bound
electrons and outside of the nucleus there are
other electrons which have been called the planetary
electrons and these until recently were taken as
acting like little planets moving jn definite orbits
inconceivably minute of course rotating about
the nucleus this view has been slightly modified
of late by the conception of the schroedinger
atom-editor

 a reader who has a complete set
 of amazing stories gives us
 his views
 editor amazing stories

   i have on file every copy of amazing stories
 published thus far which i believe ought to en-
 title me to send you my suggestions on improving
 etc a magazine which cant be surpassed any-
 where at any price

   in the first place i would like to ask you to
 use the sort of paper you used about a year ago
 in my opinion which is worth absolutely nothing
 i believe that the old paper used at about the
 time the invisible man one of wells stories
 was published was far superior to that in use
 now however that is not of the first importance
 if amazing stories were published on wrapping
 paper it would make not the slightest difference
 to me id buy it and like it too

   one thing i would like to have you change
 though is your habit of publishing novelettes
 stories of two-issue length as serials why cant
 you publish them complete in one issue as death
 from the skies was if that would take too
 much space you could save them for the quarter-
 ly if you desire to publish serials and publish-
 ing serials is a thing no editor can resist why
 dont you print complete books serials should
 be books anyhow all the three-issue stories were
 most excellent for example the moon pool
 the skylark of space etc

   another thing under discussion is your staff
 of artists and their drawings above all stands
 wesso artist supreme even the great paul him-
 self cannot hope to rival wesso wesso has a
 wonderful imagination his drawings of the
 man from space in the current issue show
 that he also knows his scientific instruments as
 shown by his illustrations for a baby on nep-
 tune and others and boy how that man can
 drawl it his human beings are human too as
 for shadings and the like just take a glimpse at
 the quarterlys pictures for the other side of
 the moon what a combination imagination
 remarkable ability to draw and a knowledge of
 scientific instruments what other quality need
 a scientific artist possess i am exceedingly
 sorry not to say alarmed at seeing only two
 stories illustrated by wesso in the present issue
 the cover is also by another artist by the way
 the artist who drew the cover for the february
 issue morey is wessos biggest threat he is
 no mean illustrator but he can in no way rival
 wesso i cant say that i care much for the other
 artists namely mckay wallitt bob dean etc
 but anderson he drew the picture for the ice
 man is pretty fair but please have wesso
 draw the cover and the pictures for nearly if not
 all the stories with morey as second best

   i also favor wessos method of having several
 pictures for each story instead of only one as the
 rest do

   also why dont you organize a good re-
 print department at least for a few serials a
 year  by a reprint department i mean for you to
 have a coupon on which it states vote for your
 favorite story on this ballot place a list of the
 best stories of scientifiction that you have ever
 read-that have not been published
 in this magazine and which you would
 enjoy re-reading-in order of preference on the
 line below place a check against the name of the
 story you think would be best to reprint

   i am positive your readers have a long list of
 favorites they would like to read once more i
 know i have besides whether a story is new or
 not if it is good the readers will like it and if
 a large number of readers wish to re-read a story
 why it must be good

                         a w bernal

               e d st oakland calif

    this letter from one of our old time friends is
 so suggestive that we feel that the best use we can
 make of it is to file it away in our minds and use
 some of the suggestions as circumstances permit
 it is said that comparisons are odious but when
 we say that we consider wesso and morey about
 the best artists weve ever had on amazing
 stories we do not agree that such a comparison
 would be odious of course we thoroughly agree
 with what you say we find that artists are un-
 certain and temperamental people to deal with
 bob dean has been very severely criticized by our
 readers but his temperament leans to the humorous
 in a high degree and in that type of illustration
 he excels if you could see the number of really
 good stories that we receive from contributors you
 would realize that  pages gives little room for
 reprints and certainly many of our readers have
 complained about many of the reprints which we
 have given them in the past-editor

    appreciation of one of our
 authors notes in physical
 and chemical science
 editor amazing stories

     have just finished reading my january copy
  of the amazing stories and wish to compliment
  you on the discovery of a splendid new author
  although you say he is a young man it seems
  almost incredible that this can be really the work
  of a mere beginner his science is really brilliant
  and every one with whom i have spoken after
  having read it has said the same i suppose that
  may be some of your readers will miss the love
  interest which is so conspicuous by its absence but
  i think its about perfect as a science story alone

   i sincerely hope that mr campbell will not
 stop at this one success but will give us more and
 more the illustrations were good but did not
 always follow the written description regarding
 shape and size of the ship for instance i have
 always been a great admirer of dr keller but it
 seems to me that he is not as good as he used to
 be the corpse that lived would not seem to
 belong in amazing stories as much as in some
 other magazine the fourth dimensional space-
 penetrator was excellent there are some faults
 in the science however-light x-rays or cosmic
 rays always travel  miles per second i
 there is nothing relative about that also no
 elemental gas can be explosive-as mr kendig
 claims for polerictic gas the atom may be ex-
 plosive as in the element niton but the gas as a
 whole can not be explosive due to the necessary
 configuration for stability of atomic structure
 there can be no element between those we know
 it is impossible

    a hyatt verrill is no doubt a famous botanist
  and archeologist but please tell him to refrain
  from physics i am afraid he is sadly lacking
  although i admire his style immensely

   all in all i think your magazine is getting
 better each copy and if we can have more stories
 each time with the assurance of exact science and
 not merely fiction-science it will certainly rise in
 the opinion of many of us we like our science
 but off the griddle of truth

                     mrs james middleton

                   lincton ave orange n j
  seriously speaking it is a matter of pure
  surmise how soon some new theory of the consti-
  tution of the atoms will be involved perhaps
  even the mystic no  will be changed but we
  do not want to indulge in scientific heresy in these
  comments although it is fair to say that this type
  of unbelief has done a great deal to develop
  modern science if an atom is explosive why
  should not a gas composed of such atoms joined
  perhaps in pairs as  molecules be explosive
  there is so much to learn about atoms and mole-
  cules that we cannot take it as certain that they
  are exactly what the present theory makes them
  the theory of the structures of the atom has been
  materially changed within a very short period and
  may be changed more your criticism however
  is very interesting dr kellers new stories
  which we have scheduled for early publication you
  will find are quite clever he is one of our best
  authors-editor

prints which are often re-
quested by our corre

 editor amazing stories

   it is hardly the done thing tp rush off
 into letters to the editor on this side of tho
 pond but i feel i must send you a line of
 congratulation

   i enjoy reading your publication immensely
 its the only magazine one can buy of its type
 here unfortunately it is extremely difficult to
 get it here only one or two shops keep it i do
 not suggest you alter its name-far from it but
 must admit that many people mix it up with such
 magazines as breezy stories snappy stories and
 most of which have a slightly questionable repu-
 tation this side

   now as for the stories you publish-why
 oh why must you waste pages and pages
 of good space on jules vernes desert of
 ice this can be bought anywhere for a
 few coppers two shillings at the outside i
 then when one has to wait a whole month
 for your precious  pages and pay one and
 sixpence for them  to  pages are spent
 hashing up -year-old scientifiction

   personally i enjoy your mechanical inter-
 planetary and futuristic stories such as
 menace from mars your biological stories
 leave me cold especially in view of the fact
 that that particular subject is a study of
 mine

   mind you mr editor--im not asking you

     if there is one thing i like to do its writing to
  you im writing this letter chiefly to comment on
  your december  issue lets gol

    vampires of the desert-verrill a nice
 interesting story but i didnt like it half as much
 as into the green prism or the bridge of
 light but like all of verrills stories its
 different so-so

    a baby on neptune-harris and dr breuer
 fine a good old interplanetary tale-of strange
 races and adventures on distant worlds more
 stories by these two

    the colloidal nemesis-vincent of course
 this has to be good look whom its by i declare
 i dont believe harl vincent could write a bad
 story his microcosmic buccaneers was a
 masterpiece i by the way this is the first story by
 him that had no love in it

    the time deflector-remember mr editor
 speaking of humorous stories if you want to get a
 good laugh compare those foolish hicks things
 with the time deflector boy edward can
 sure write a humorous scientific tale talk about
 funny  i certainly enjoyed the time de-
 flector

    the twenty-first century limited-slachta
 this tale was pretty good but nothing out of the
 ordinary i think it was rather weak a plot
 yes but not handled correctly middle class mr
 slachta

    the secret kingdom-kline company great i
 wonderful cheers to the nth degree for the
 kline brothers  come on science fansl give em
 a big hand

   a letter of the twenty-fourth century-
 stone-a neat little sketch enjoyable light
 reading

   now mr editor the other side of the
 moon by edmond hamilton was wonderful
 i said that the secret kingdom was the best in

 but i cant find suitable words to praise hamiltons

  liberated in your comment you said that you
  thought it was stable enough and i have received
  a great many letters on the subject many more
  than i could hope to answer from the readers i
  now wish to give you the reasoning on which i
  base my assumption

     a satellite at the distance of a million miles from
  venus would be attracted by the sun with a
  force over ninety times as great as the pull that
  venus exerts this may easily be seen by apply-
  ing newtons law of gravitation that the force is
  proportional to the mass and inversely as the
  square of the distance the mass of the sun is
  about  times that of venus and the nearest
  distance from the sun to the satellite would be
  about  times the distance from kellos to venus
  therefore

   suns attraction on kelios-times venus

                                  

  attraction which equals a little over  times

    however this alone does not prove that the
 satellite would leave venus that condition may
 be illustrated by considering the case of the moon
 and the earth and sun the mass of the sun is
 about  times that of the earth and its
 distance is about  times that from the earth to
 the moon which gives
 

 --or a little over two

      

    therefore the sun attracts the moon with a
 force over twice as great as the earths attrac-
 tion yet the moon does not leave the earth to re-
 volve around the sun if the earth could be
 stopped in its orbit and remain fixed the sun
 would pull the moon away but both the earth and
 the moon are free to move and they revolve around
 the sun as a system not as isolated bodies in
 other words it is the center of the earth-moon
 system that revolves around the sun once a year
 in an elliptical orbit while both the center of the
 earth and the center of the moon revolve once a
 month around the same system this center of
 mass is situated on a line between the two centers
 and lies about one thousand miles below the sur-
 face of the earth on the side toward the moon

    to find the effective force tending to pull the
  moon away to the sun we must take the difference
  in the acceleration produced on both the earth and
  moon when the moon is on the side nearest the
  sun at new moon at that time the sun is pulling
  both the earth and the moon but the acceleration
  on the moon force divided by the moons mass is
  greater than the acceleration on the earth because
  the moon is nearer the sun than the earth is it is
  this difference in acceleration that measures the
  effective attraction of the sun on the moon tending
  to pull it away from the earth and that quantity
  is quite small compared to the attraction of the
  earth which has to be overcome

    the same conditions of course may be applied to
  the case of the hypothetical satellite of venus at
  a distance of a million miles on the side nearest
  to the sun it would be about sixty-six million
  miles distant and venus would be about sixty-
  seven million miles the relative acceleration
  would then be

    sun on satellite -  or approximately 
    sun on venus   or approximately s

    therefore - is the proportional part of the

  suns attraction on the satellite tending to pull it
  away from venus as this is much greater than

      which is venus attraction on kellos in terms

 of the suns previously found it seems that
 kellos is unstable and would not last a single
 revolution as i stated in my previous letter

    i hope that you will publish this letter as part
  answer to those who wrote me and whom i was
  unable to answer

   there is no doubt that it does one good to get
severe criticisms you will frequently find that
our correspondents give arrangements of the titles
of published stories in the order of what they
think is their merit we do not regard letters
like yours as discouraging but rather feel that
they contain healthy criticisms and help us on our
way because we feel there is genuine interest be-
hind them-editor

   a letter of excellent and
helpful criticism
editor amazing stories

  being a mere infant in the realm of science

i realize that my voicings will not hold a great
deal of thunder but even the tiny babe likes to
be heard to give vent to his fussings

  first i would like to take advantage of your
readers vote of preference

  i did not care much for the story beyond
the green prism this statement is liable to
cause a great avalanche of scorn to be poured
down upon me because it was virtually in answer
to a request for a sequel to into the green prism

i did not read the latter so i may not know what
i am talking about when i say i did not care
much for it i mean that it was not as fascinating
as the general run of the tales in amazing
stories it seemed to me to be lacking in real
honest-to-goodness action the element of suspense
was also lacking in my opinion

  now for the corpse that lived as a story
it was fine but as an amazing story it lacked the
amazing element although there were some very
ingenious suggestions of the future as a lore
story it was good but please do not let your
mag go to the cupids although the intwining
of love with scientifiction puts more realism into
the stories

  air lines seemed to be smeared gaudily
with love also not that i am opposed to love
for being a young man i am not immune to human
instincts but i do not fancy the element of love
dominating that of science

  having exhausted my vocabulary in knocks 
will now try to redeem myself

  when the atoms failed was good why i
liked it i do not know unless it was because of
scientific facts and possibilities mixed with plenty
of action

  i cannot see why some critics pick some
insignificant impossibility and proceed to give their
reasons why it is impossible if it were not for
the seeming impossibilities your stories would
surely be of dry texture although the known
facts should by all means be given covrectly there
should be no restriction on the imagination of the
far-reaching statements and suppositions which
constitute the greater part of your stories for in-
stance why should the life of another planet be
discussed according to the laws of this world for
the theories of science are constantly changing  v

  the sword and the atopen the first
ornithopter fourth dimensional space pene-
trator and the hungry guinea-pig were all
interesting as well as instructive

heiner utah

  your criticisms do not read as if you were a
mere infant in the realm of science we are de-
lighted at the points of view which you take
there is a little love which comes into our stories
now and then but really comparatively little and
the idea of only putting in absolute scientific pos-
sibilities would do exactly what you say-it would
reduce our material to a dead level of dryness
the imagination has been often assumed and be-
lieved to be very important in scientific investiga-
tions and we hope that our magazine far from
preventing anyones efforts to use their imagina-
tion would encourage them in it in accordance
with the line of criticism which you give in your

amazing stories

very interesting communication imagination is
almost the first thing in original scientific investi-
gation-then in the laboratory you can test and

  s-a-y how much better is our magazine going
to become when i read the march copy the
first i had read since the magazine changed man-

degree however the two succeeding issues
namely the april and may were still better in my
opinion i cannot conceive of any improvement

authors the june copy is going to be even better

in your answer to mr willbanks letter which
was printed in may a s you stated that more
love and romance were to be injected into the
stories this was quite a setback to me just
as i was congratulating myself on finding a scien-
tific magazine in which the love and romance
element kept its proper place in the dim back-

lowered to the level of the other magazines which
clutter up the newsstands

  you praise us so highly in your letter that we
hesitate to publish it appreciation by the readers
of amazing stories is a great asset from the
editors standpoint for we are certainly trying
to make it good john w campbell jr is not
the same person as john c campbell jr and
leslie f stone does honor to it by being a mem-
ber of the interesting weaker sex you need not
be afraid that love and romance will not be kept
in their proper place in a s we certainly plan
to maintain our policy of publishing only scien-
tific fiction-editor

     the paper and cover of
amazing stories
editor amazing stohies

--as a steady reader of amazing stories maga-
zine both monthly and quarterly i have this
suggestion to make which you may accept at its
worth

  as a public school teacher there is a certain
literary standard to which my friends and ac-
quaintances expect me to live the contents
of your amazing stories are well up in this
standard but the paper on which it is printed and
the shrieking covers are simply atrocious to me
and to many of those who read your magazines
the appearance of them smacks entirely too much
of the cheap tawdry ten-cent fiction to be found
in every illiterate persons hands

  why not put a respectable-looking cover on
your magazine and print it on some half-way
decent paper it will appeal quite as much to
your readers and will stop them from hiding the
magazine in a cover or envelope in order not to
have people think they are reading some silly piece
of cheap trash i trust that you will give this
suggestion some serious consideration

  we can only say that we wish you knew how
much thought and care is given to the cover pages
each one is supposed to depict an incident in one
of the stories and the nature of the stories
is such that at first sight the covers may seem
what you call shrieking but take the trouble
to study the cover and you will change your mind
the paper which we use being free from glossi-
ness is particularly good from the standpoint
of preserving the eyesight we are looking for-

too distant future when we can put a s across
as one of the definitely high grade and literary
magazines we will if our readers continue to
stand by us and help-editor

a letter from the backwaters op
civilization
editor amazing stories

  the october and november numbers arrived
o k and we have had much pleasure in reading
the same you may count on me as a regular
subscriber from now on amazing stories should
be more read in western canada it is not on
sale in the small towns and villages and i am
sure it would have a large market if it were pushed
here you know it is said anyone who does any-
thing a little better than anyone else will have a
beaten path to his door but we must have in
mind that the world has to be informed of the
fact or dse how are they to knowf

  i consider amazing stories not only proves
most interesting reading but it also has an educa-
tional value and it would be advantageous if
every boy in canada read the magazine to say
the least the stories are clean and tend to interest
the imagination which is a very desirable tendency
indeed

   i notice some of your readers do not appreciate
your reprints of jules verne and i just wonder if
in reality his stories are now out of date or has
our literary appetite become depraved as it were
through reading the trash the reading market is
flooded with these days we are overwbehned
with wild west cow boy killer stories which are
anything but good reading for the young folks
as were the buffalo bill and deadwood dick stories
we read in england  years ago and they were
then regarded as blood and thunder

   i think i have read nearly all of jules vernes
works and should dearly love to once more read
many of them but many are now out of print and
when we read them again we may be disappointed
as after all most of our desires fall short of our
anticipation when we realize them something al-
ways mars them more or less

   yet i should like to test the matter and my boys
might like to read jules vernes stories the satis-
factory ones are there not several of them in
print in north america

  how about stories of a lawne his con-
quest of the moon and the mystery of ecba-
tana and the romance of two worlds by
one corelli why not ceazers column max
pembertons iron pirate we used to enjoy when
a boy frank reids stories-we never bear of
them now

  i note many readers would like the name amaz-
ing stories changed to amazing scientific
why not please one and all

  in  we here in canada could get ameri-
can magazines at the same price as they were de-
livered in u s a but now there is an extra
postage charge it is a boycott on good reading

  has science ever dealt with latent cold this
is not perhaps just the most adequate definition
it might be better to write speed of cold the
thermometer shows us ordinary temperature but
we all know who have experienced the chilly ef-
fect of a few winds which only affect the theft
mometer a degree or two that that latent speed
cold affects us in a positive manner another
scientific phenomenon that has always interested
me is the action of the gyroscope and i can see
some possibilities not some new factors to dis-
cuss and having kept the following idea under my
hat for  years consider it high time to band
it over to you mr editor to suggest that one of
you construct a story based on this i am not
situated where i can make experiments on one hand
nor have i ability to write fiction i am not a
mathematician and my transmission will not mesh
in with einsteins formulas and differential calcu-
lus and though i was rather good with a -gauge
shotgun and rook rifle i am not versed in trigo-
nometry and living here in the backwaters new
ideas filter through my mind but slowly

  my idea is to make a compound gyroscope that
is two heavy wheels one within the other and at
right angles to one another and of equal mass then
setting them to sun on the dual spin and devise
means to both vary the mutual speed and vary the
speed of each in relation to the other in that
way we might get a new means if locomotion
that would overcome the action of gravitation get
the idea

  another idea that could be used to build
amazing stories is an internal external com-
bustion motor in which the fuel is burned under
constant pressure constant temperature at con-
stant volume and then led as required from the
container or generator to the cylinders f the
august 

amazinq stories



motor the above carburetor and ignition are all
done away with

  i never knew until i read amazing stories
that the action of a rocket is not based on atmos-
pheric pressure and i do not even now just grasp
the point

walker hodgson
melville sask canada

  we agree with you that a good story could be
based on the curious instrument the gyroscope
we could give a quantity of jules vernes stories
and already have given a number but some of
our readers write us that the verne stories are old-
fashioned and fail to interest them some of them
are of a higher order of merit than others in
the voyage to the center of the earth which
we published some years ago jules verne in the
beginning gives us a description of iceland which
is astonishingly good he never did much travel-
ing but he certainly could describe scenery mar-
velously well in the internal combustion motor
the pressure is produced and the pressure is at its
highest when the gases are hottest your idea of
exploding them and then drawing upon them later
would not work elsewhere we say something
about the rocket so we need not repeat it here
except to tell you that the action of the rocket does
not depend on the air surrounding it and it would
go better if there were no air-editor

a very appreciative letter about
some of our stories

editor amazing stories

  i am writing to tell you how much i enjoyed
the february edition of your magazine it gets
better every month i hope this long-thought-out
digest of your stories will help you

  explorers of callisto is a very good story as
far as it went i thought it was cut off in the most
interesting part making it seem incomplete

  the twentieth century homoculus was pretty
fair but not up with your best as it records
failure of science

  the ice man was highly fantastic and is
some of the best comedy that you have printed it
is comparable to that famous series hicks ad-
ventures with a kick i havent laughed so
much in months i had the whole family laughing
with me at marcus publius birds eye view of
twentieth century femininity apparently he en-
joyed the short skirt fad and i suppose we would
find him mourning the long skirt fad that has
supplanted it fickle woman from one extreme
to another a good comic like this one adds
spice and pep to the magazine how about one a
month 

  the man from space a beautiful story but
i wish bobs dream had lasted a little longer
hansen writes good stories and i find some of his
descriptions somewhat similar to verrius

  the radio robbery was just good it could
have had more explanation in it it left a lot to
the imagination

  vitamine z was entrancing i pity both dr
beardsley and the world he lost his life while we
lost his great discovery i hope we have more
stories by dr w lemkin i enjoyed cold
light by the same author

  beyond the green prism just another verrill
success if your whole magazine was just com-
posed of stories by verrill i think it would be as
good as it is now i hope his next story is a
fantasy such as the moon pool such descrip-
tions we seem to be in those scenes of mag-
nificence whose beauty takes our breath away and
we live and breathe the stories we read do not
lose verrill

  into the valley of death a few tingling
minutes of breath-taking adventure in death
valley it ended just right for a short story

  i hope your magazine continues just as good as
it is now i hope you will continue to give new
authors a chance as you have discovered a lot of
good talent keep our magazine superior to
competitors

kenneth treeby

 ryan st buffalo new york

  your comments are very flattering there is
one thing we do want to say we observe that
you admire the ice man this was a story
which we enjoyed greatly the humor in it we
feel was expressed without degenerating into
anything like boisterousness and the little sarcastic
touch which pervaded it was most delightful it
reminds us of edgar allan poe who in some
words with a mummy and in the thousand
and second tale of scheherezade also gives
some of his views about things in modern times
curiously enough we have received a letter from
a correspondent who is absolutely indignant about
this story we have printed the other letter in a
previous issue-editor

half a million people

 have learned music this easy way

you too can learn to play your
favorite instrument without a
teacher

easy as artbc

many of this half million didnt
know one note from another
-yet in half the usual time they learned to play
their favorite instrument best of all they found
learning music amazingly easy no monotonous
hours of exercises-no tedious scales-no ex-

your favorite pieces-jazz ballads classics no
private teacher could make it clearer the cost is
surprisingly low-averaging only a few cents a
day-and the price

  stories-william wilson-the man of the
  crowd and berenice all by edgar allan poe
