why cant you
write

it much simpler than you think

so many people with the germ of writing in them
simply cant get started they suffer from inertia
or they set up imaginary barriers to taking the first
step

   many are convinced the field is confined to persons
gifted with the genius for writing

   few realize that the great bulk of commercial writ-
ing is done by so-called unknowns not only do
these thousands of men and women produce most of
the fiction published but countless articles on business
affairs social matters domestic science etc as well

   such material is in constant demand evry week
thousands of checks for   and  go out to
writers whose latent ability was perhaps no greater
than yours

the practical method

    newspaper work demonstrates that the way to learn to write
is by writing newspaper copy-desk editors waste no time on
theories or ancient classics the story is the thing every copy
cub goes through the course of practical criticism-a training
that turns out more successful authors than any other experience

that is why newspaper institute of america bases its writing
instruction on the copy-desk method it starts and keeps you
writing in your own home on your own time and upon the very
same kind of actual assignments given daily to metropolitan
reporters thus you learn by doing not by studying the indi-
vidual styles of model authors

each week your work is analyzed constructively by practical
newspaper men gradually they help to clarify your own dis-
tinctive style writing soon becomes easy absorbing profitable
too as you gain the professional touch that gets your material
accepted by editors above all you can see constant progress
week by week as your faults are corrected and your writing
ability grows

       have you natural ability

the brigantine was identical with the her-
-l maphrodite brig except that in place of the
triangular fore-and-aft gaff topsail on the main-
mast the brigantine swung one or two square
topsails as time went on these topsails were
found to be inefficient and the gaff topsail was
substituted thus turning the rig into a her-
maphrodite brig

  many of these little ships were employed as
privateers and slavers from newport rhode
island the brigantine sanderson david linsay
master cleared for the slave coast in the winter
of  she was of forty tons burden and
carried a captain two mates and six men he
wrote to his owners from the african guinea

noes when i shall gett clear of it ye traid is
so dull it is actually a noof to make a man
creasy my cheefe mate after making four or
five trips in the boat was taken sick and re-
mains very bad yett i should be glad i cood
come rite home with my slaves for my vessiel
will not last to proceed far

  however prosperity was evidently just
around the corner for on june seventeenth we
find him writing from barbados with fifty-six
slaves aboard all in health and fatt i lost
one small gall he received for his slaves
thirty pounds each and after deducting duties
and commission managed to show a profit of
 pounds  at that time the
slave trade was considered legitimate and even
respectable and the profits were great although
the voyages were dangerous in the extreme in
one church a respectable elder was always in
the habit of returning thanks on the sunday
following a slave-ships arrival in newport in
these words an overruling providence has
been pleased to bring to this land of freedom
another cargo of benighted heathen to enjoy
the blessing of a gospel dispensation

how  years
training gave me
a  raise

from teacher to executive in 
years at  times the income

stuck in an obscure job as principal of a
little school in rural texas-earning under
 a year-b j mertz was desperate

the years were slipping by he was in a
rut-getting nowhere what could he do

  listen like millions stuck just that way
mertz saw one clear ray of light through the
gloom like thousands of other courageous
men and women each year he sent for the
great books lasalle offers free the in-
spiring ten years promotion in one
the challenging accountancy the profes-
sion that pays

  mertz soon learned as thousands with real
backbone annually learn home study train-
ing pays-amazingly and pays you
your whole life long

  so mertz trained-increased his business
value-and today is comptroller and a
director of a large and successful casualty
company not everyone can do as well of
course but nearly everyone can step up his
income if hell train-some actually earn two
to five times as much in only a few months

dare you say you cant

last night i heard the howling of
the wild dogs up on the hou-
 venkopf and i knew straight-
 way that there was death on
the mountain a strange queer business
is the death-howl of a dog and it borders
near those things we in our profound
ignorance label as supernatural but
so is the houvenkopf a strange queer
place and so are the wild dogs them-
selves a queer fact and so was the man
mawm rukker whose withered tired old
soul was flickering out when the dogs set
up their howling a strange and scarcely
believable coefficient of our hills

  i suppose you younger moderns will
put me down as a doddering muddle-
headed old fool of a country doctor a
simple rustic because i listened to the
howling of the dogs and because i am
naive enough to have believed in the
classical or legendary interpretation of
it youll call me eccentric or touched

perhaps because i have chosen to spend
most of my life up here in the ramapo
valley-a rural medico with a large
practice and small income trying to help
our little hill people bringing children
into the world for them earning their
trust and sympathizing with them even
taking their part sometimes against
you people who haughtily call your-
selves civilized had i any enterprise
any decent ambition youll say i might
have set up offices in the city and made
a fortune prescribing pills for neurotic
ladies with fat bank-accounts and learn-
ing your bedside manner

  oh ill admit that my young col-
leagues  but that was not what i wanted
youve had it and youre welcome but
those city people are yours not mine i
was born among these hills and i love
them the houvenkopf and its strange
little people have always been at my
back door and who i ask you would
you will not sooti forget this extraordinary story of a
strange wild people living almost at the gates of gotham

illustrated by austin briggs

have cared for their hundreds of ill-born
ill-nourished babies who would have
cured their croup and their measles and
their ringworms  who would have sewn
up the knife-wounds for that young devil
pilter ared when the merely woman
stabbed him  who would have supplied
the snake-venom for scores of rattler and
copperhead bites and who i ask you
again would have fought for justice
when the devil came into our valley and
brought poison hatred murder war and
tragedy among those simple untamed
unknown primitives the jackson whites

  not you my young diagnosticians of
park avenue-nor the school authorities
which patronized them into education
nor the self-appointed missionaries nor
the law that confuses justice with doctrine

  but the dogs have howled and mawm
rukker is dead and now the story can
be told without harm for judith the
saint may at last come down from the
mountain scattering the embers of hate
to the winds of the valley and bring-
ing hei love and her peace

  mawm rukker dead that old ras-
cal who cares for mawm rukker
who cares for the jackson whites who
cares for a race of outcasts living a
stones-throw from new york city yet
who have never seen a telephone  race
of hybrids most of them the descendants
of indians and of deserting soldiers and
of african slaves let them die youll
say life has no time for them new
york and new jersey have no place for
tjiem civilization cant wait for them
let them get civilized or die youll say
and mawm rukker-what was that
story in the papers awhile back wasnt
there a trial  didnt he kill somebody 
or was it his son  wasnt there a wom-
an in it nasty business wasnt it
mawm rukker dead probably a good
thing too 

  but wait a minute my smart young
friends and listen to an old mans story

do you know our ramapos do you
know that world of green hills and
maples and firs and mica-rock and rho-
the blue book magazine

dodendrons and tiny lakes and deer and
partridge lying on the very door-sill of
fifth avenue where you can drop sud-
denly out of a land of garish road-signs
and hideous gas-stations into a quick
primitive glorious paradise where the
noises of industry are hushed where
the winds are laden with soft songs of
indian lore where the rich black loafn
is bursting with a green joy

  i was born there my young blades
and i love that country fifty-seven
years ago i was born there and in those
days mawm rukker was a young man

 negroes you call them aye
theyre black enough some of them
and theres indian blood too tusca-
roras driven out of the carolinas by
settling germans settling in the rama-
pos back in  or thereabouts and
joining the five nations of the iroquois
but what of the three thousand five hun-
dred white slaves-women kidnaped

and transported from londons slums for
the hessian mercenaries of the british
army in the days when george washing-
ton was making this country free from
the absurdity of a cloddish george iii
when the british were driven out of

               wliueh law is ut
               diit take away a
               man ills wooin-
               an lie asked

new york those poor girls-whatever
their morals may god forgive them-
were hounded into the ramapos to live
as outcasts and to form a colony with
the deserting hessian soldiery the tus-
caroras and a handful of black slave-
girls who had been with them theres
the ancestry put it frankly but out
of that grim background has grown
through the flux of years a new race
primitive and strong

and yet mawm rukker was from none
of these

i can remember vividly how the very
name of him grew to be a symbol of
something utterly fantastic in my own
childhood my father-he was old doc
borsden to all the valley farmers-was
something of a tartar in his way i can
remember how he stormed at the fright-
ened waddling slightly hysterical abi-
gail ness our hired woman on that
day when i first heard of the jackson
whites six or seven i was then and i
had been guilty of some childhood
naughtiness abigail in her countrified
illiterate anger had tried to scare me
into good behavior by pointing at the
crag of the houvenkopf with a warning
finger and saying

  yell behave now ye little fool else
mawm rukker the wild manll come
for ye with his pack o dogs

  quite overawed by the tone of her
voice and by the forbidding denseness
of the houvenkopfs black forest i
whispered

  whos mawm rukker

  hes a jack she said and for
aught i know he may be the devil him-
self surely hes king of the moun-
tain she added seriously and he has
a pack of black dogs that obey him and
which no bullet can touch-and he
feeds bad little boys to them too
properly chastened i remember run-
ning to ask my father what it was she
meant by a jack then it was that
the story came out
the devil came

  a stern man my father but a just one

a doctor he knew well enough the harm
and the futility of frightening little
children into good behavior with stories
of bogey-men whether real or fancied
but there was still another feeling in him
that moved him to upbraid abigail he
summoned her to his study and as she
stood trembling there he paced the floor
while his vibrating voice ground out

  abigail ness yell never tell my son
another yarn about the hill people else
by god not another days work from
this family will ye get-nor from any
other house in the valley either as long
as i live let you understand that
yell never attempt to frighten the boy
into obedience and sow the seed of fear
in him and let that also be understood
woman

  but take ye note of this as long as
im alive the jackson white people
shall be rtespected in this house strange
people they may be wild they may
be and fearsome to you but theyre
humans god made them woman and
likely theyre as good as the rest of us
and ill have none of your housewives
gossip about them whilst you live here

  nevertheless as i grew older rumors
and stories of the jackson whites and
especially of mawm rukker came to
me and indeed that man might well
have been the devil himself for what
was said of him though i was already
quite a lad when first i saw him the
legends that grew around the man
bloomed in my childs imagination until
he became to me half-god half-ogre

 mawm rukker the very name had
a sound to it what queer kind of
creature would be called mawm ruk-
ker was it not this mawm rukker
who had come down from the houven-
kopf into hilburn and nearly killed five
strong men in a quarrel  had the man
not run away with bess tisbury that
pale handsome daughter of a pinch-
penny farmer from down saddle river
way had he not shot the hat from
farmer tisburys head and the shotgun
out of the hand of tisburys son when the
two of them indignant and wrafhful had
stormed the mountain to bring the run-
away girl back home again had he
not raided a store in oakland stolen a
sack of flour and a case of applejack
holding a whole village at bay with his
deadly rifle and laughing in the very
faces of the frightened citizens mawm
rukker had done this he had done that
mawm rukker the fatal marksman

to our valley	

mawm rukker the wild drunkard of
the hills mawm rukker whom the
black dogs wild scourge and terror of
the valley farms obeyed like lambs
so ran the legends making him into a
fantastic supernatural creature shar-
ing the identities of the pirates of old
and the highwaymen and the noble gods
of mythology in my young heart

  and then one day i saw him

  if you were born a country boy youll
know what it is to shoulder your baby
rifle and to snap -caliber bb caps
at some ferocious woodchuck you have
stalked as though he were some panther
of the jungle what a grim relentless
huntsman you were in your teens the
scrawny wood near your home abounded
in chucks and skunks and chipmunks
and squirrels and perhaps an owl or
two all of which called for your un-
rivaled skill and prowess as a nimrod to
exterminate them in later years we
may stalk our antelope in the senegal or
lions in the sudan but there is no thrill
in our lives like the stalking of our first
woodchuck with that ancient flobert
which grandpa gave us for our four-
teenth birthday

  and i was stalking my woodchuck
bellied in the grass i was my face to
the wind the scent of clover in my nos-
trils and the exotic pulsation of the
jungle perhaps half a mile from our
farmstead pumping in my veins so
intent was i upon the fat little beast
which crouched by his hole that i did
not see the sharp grass-hidden chasm
where some tree-stump had been blasted
out of the ground on i crawled i
shifted to the side for better vision-and
tumbled into the pit with a frightened
scream-my rifle going off as it fell in
after me-and striking my head against
a sharp rock at the bottom darkness
swallowed me then

when i returned to consciousness i
was being carried hurriedly through
the fields two enormous red-hairy arms
held my body and the pungent scent of
wood-smoke hung over me emanating
from the man who ran with me my
head pained badly pounding with the
great loping strides he was taking and
i could feel the steel pressure of the
arms that held me so tight i twisted
around to look up into the fierce hawk
features of turn and i saw the bristling
thatch of red hair and the intense iron-
gray eyes that peered down at me from
under the hair




the blue book magazine

  and so frightened for my life i
screamed again

  ha came the odd foreign-seeming
voice soo uts not dead den dunt
screech soo nah childy yo keep quiet
whiles us run by yo housen to papa for
feex ut wi a bit cloth again the blood
rough the voice was and booming
and the language was new and hard for
me to make out and the pain in my
head was bad and there was fear in me
fighting at my senses and terrifying me
as i saw the huge form more clearly
the torn faded blue shirt of him was
studded with burrs and the ragged
trousers were patched with leather
against the cloth and there was a great
knife sticking in the piece of rope that
served him for a belt and so in my
fear the tears came to me

  i cried and i kicked and i struggled
but he only ran the faster straight to
our house and when he trampled over
the gray-white gravel of our driveway
he lifted his great voice and bellowed
ha dere doc borsden coom oot
quick cause yo childys bloodied on
hisn haid

  my father came running

 hello to you mawm rukker i
heard him say and then good god
man whats the boy done to himself
at that fabulous name i fainted as
much from the thrill of it as from
the effects of my fright

revived and bandaged i sat up in
 a horsehair chair in my fathers of-
fice all a-wonder that my father should
dare to converse so quietly and at his
ease with this monster rukker was
still standing-he would never sit down
indoors i learned later-with a bit of
pipe in his mouth and his rifle dangling
from his hand carrying the odor of
pine-trees and burnt leaves into the anti-
septic atmosphere of the room

  my father was saying

  i thank ye mawm rukker for fetch-
ing the lad in and how is your own
little one and bess herself how is
she these days are they all well up on
the mountain its near time for me
to come up again now

  rukker rumbled out

  mine galeg he is goot enough mine
bess she is goot for deres a childy
cornin agin which is whyen i haf coom
to tell yo shell haf need maybe-
my father dismissed me with a sign
and i carried my bandaged head away
quivering with delight and terror too to

have seen mawm rukker in my own
house talking with old doc my father
as simply as any farmer of the valley
might have done

years passed before i saw him again
however although my father paid a
monthly visit to the mountain and min-
istered to the strange little people there
they may not have loved him but they
respected him and trusted him

  it was in  that i came home from
the university to begin sharing my fa-
thers practice the whole countryside
was in a turmoil the grange was up
in arms all the farmers had inflamed
themselves to a pitch of excitement and
anger that is hard to imagine the rea-
son was-the wild dogs of the ramapos

  since early childhood i had heard
tales of these beasts though as i grew
older i discredited them legendary
dogs they were-immense beyond be-
lief coal-black and wolflike running in
packs of shadowy phantoms frighten-
ing travelers appearing and disappear-
ing like the werewolves of fable there
were stories of their fierce raids upon
the livestock of the valley farmers and
one even heard tales of hunters ventur-
ing in the hills only to vanish their
bones picked clean of flesh arid crushed
by the fangs of these terrible beasts
however i had grown to hold such
tales lightly and it was only now that
the fact of the dogs existence became
too evident for doubt

  there had been raids hard winter
had starved the wild dogs and fanned
their courage in oakland in pompton
in wanaque and even on the outskirts
of suffern these great black wolf-dogs
had appeared in numbers had butchered
sheep and cattle had laid waste fifty or
more barnyards and had even attacked
and torn beyond surgical intervention
one of the huge percheron stallions which
were the pride of farmer tisbury whose
daughter had eloped with the wild ruk-
ker years before and if there were any
room now for me to doubt the tale one
of the farmers had shot and killed a
wild dog and the carcass was plainly
visible to all who cared to ride over
darlington way for a look at it

  i rode arid i saw and i confess the
beast was a beauty it must have
weighed nearly one hundred and seven-
ty pounds-big as a dane or a mastiff
but bristling with short tufted hair and
with the lean angular muzzle of a boar-
hound coal-black it was but a ruff
the devil came to our valley

at its neck flecked with gray betrayed
an admixture of wolf blood

  whence came such beasts wild dogs
within thirty miles of the metropolis
impossible you say and yet let me
quote history back in the revolution-
ary days when the hessian soldiers de-
serting from a hopeless british army
fled to these mountains and joined the
outcast women those white slaves
herded and sold by the unmentionable
jackson some of those german fighting
men brought dogs with them great
dogs they were huge black boar-hounds
from brunswick and hesse-cassel sol-
diers dogs beasts of almost primeval
structure and courage in the years
that followed these monster hounds es-
caping from the hovels of the colonies
or driven out by their owners bred with
wolves and a race of doubly savage
beasts was born mongrels they are
but thrown upon their own skill and
hardihood in finding sustenance they
grew into giants of the canine species
and their descendants even today when
they have interbred again with the run-
away curs of near-by towns-with house-
dogs from your backyard and mine-
are formidable plunderers the scourge
of the farms the terror of the unwary
stranger caught in the ramapos at night

  such indeed was the dog i saw

some nights later as i was riding
home from the grange where farm-
ers were planning a posse of riders to
hunt and kill these monsters i saw a
light in my fathers study enteringj i
found him in conversation with a tall
fierce graying man whom i soon rec-
ognized as mawm rukker he had
come to warn us he had come down
from his mountain fastness to plead with
my father since the jacks trusted no
other man in the valley and to warn
him that if the farmers made a raid
against the dogs and killed them whole
villages of jackson whites would de-
fend the beasts that meant war-five
thousand or more wild men turning their
deadly rifles against the valley

  ut moost no be rukker iasisted
mine peoples dey lof dem dogs dey
had not lof for yo peoples de dogs
dey is starved ut is for eating dey
coom down here for yo i haf coom
to tell dis butten for de odders i haf
no care i do not want dis thing should
be

  then suddenly pleading-pleading for
the dogs in his strange half-intelligible

language-he said they were a part of
his own fugitives from civilization like
his own unwanted hunted hated like
himself and his people there was pas-
sion in his plea-passion and love he
told how many times he would shoot a
deer and whistle for the dogs to feed on
the carcass he told how they knew
him and in their strange wild way
loved him and understood him there
was a bond between mawm rukker and
the savage dogs of the ramapos as
surely and as clearly as there can exist a
tie between wild creatures pitted against
the onrush of civilization

  my father listened to him and there
was no dog-hunt that year for my fa-
thers voice was still law among the
farmers

but this is the story of the devil and
of judith-about a great love and
about a wood-nymph who grew too rap-
idly civilized and about a great hate
and revenge and a trial-by-jury and a
supreme gesture of self-sacrifice about
the great humility of a saint and an
immense long tragedy which terminated
only last night with the howling of the
dogs when mawm rukker died and set
judith free so let me tell it and let
it be a warning to those who would too
quickly bring civilization as a sub-
stitute for simplicity and primitive
goodness

  in  my father died and his huge
if unprofitable practice fell to me then
a youngster in my early twenties

  it was in  that the mission school
came to the houvenkopf a fine clean
earnest man was burran whatley its
founder and a kindly well-intentioned
woman was his wife a local man
whatley born and brought up in or near
the new york border and acquainted
with the jackson whites and their tragic
ignorance graduating from some re-
ligious seminary and earning the title
of reverend this young man had felt
the call to bring book-learning and the
word of god among these heathen
of the mountain i have no quarrel with
him the best of intentions are oft-
times mistaken

 and galeg son of mawm rukker
came to the mission school a great
youth was galeg-some four or six
years younger than i possibly but al-
ready taller than most men a creature
of the wilderness a green-thing like
some fabulous leprechaun grown into a
giant


the blue book magazine

   so it was at the mission school that
galeg son of mawm met and loved lit-
tle judith love is quick and young
among primitive peoples they marry
when mere children-if marriage it can
be called-and it is deemed a natural
thing simple is the ceremony the
boys father- speaks the word the
whole settlement is gathered together
and there is drinking of much mountain
beer the boy stands and challenges
any man who shall deny him this wom-
an if some other wants her he must
fight and who would have challenged
galeg rukker-galeg who could with his
bare hands have torn apart any man

   judith little judith elfin exqui-
site ethereal little judith how can i

i have como to warn you i said the state troopers are raising a posse    do
the devil came to our valley


the blue book magazine

tell you of that child nameless and
alone that child who soon blossomed
into womanhood passed through fire
and became a saint

  nameless she was i say nor can i
give you her background but she was
not of the jackson whites a fugitive
from justice presumably her father had
appeared twelve years before in my own
fathers time badly wounded and ter-
ror-stricken he hid out in the ram-
apos bringing his little baby-if she
was his-and dwelt for a few weeks in
one of the shacks of the jackson whites
up on the mountain then died there
from his infected wound my own fa-
ther saw that the child was cared for by
old mary bottle who had thirteen oth-
er children and not a sign of a husband

  but when judith came to the mission
school she was a beauty dirty and
ragged like any jack child she may have
been but her hair hung in natural ring-
lets jet black adding richness to the
white satin of her skin framing the per-
fect oval of her face and bringing new
luster to her lovely fawn-colored eyes
but there was more than mere beauty
in her something primitive and fun-
damental there was something quietly
violent yet poised restless yet calm
she drew from deeper sources than those
ramapo hills was she some child sto-
len from a good home or was she the
daughter of a thief was she born of
an illicit union the flux of some pas-
sionate tragedy we never knew and
never learned

  but the sixteen-year-old galeg and
the fourteen-year-old judith met in the
mission school and love was born we
could see them often running gayly to-
gether in the fields or on the crest of the
woodland galeg with his rifle-wild
things happy with freedom loving as
the wild birds love their spirits blown
by the free winds

  but civilization came   

  we cannot with impunity modify the
pattern of a human soul let mission-
aries beware for the leaven yeast they
dispense into the hearts of backward
people will only too often ferment into
a heady wine

the transfiguration of judith was a
miracle galeg rukker himself was
quick to learn quick to lose his hill ac-
cent quick to become a strapping man-
ly keen-witted lad whose future was
before him but judith became a woman
more quickly still she learned she de-

voured books and saw dream-vistas of a
life beyond her knowledge-a life of
comforts and clothes and jewels and
balls and gallant young swains and ex-
quisite damsels the clever fingers of
mrs whatley recut and fashioned dress-
es focer and quickly she emerged from
her cocoon of tatters into a full-bloom-
ing butterfly as graceful and beautiful
as any young woman in the land with
rhythm and restraint in her every
thought and movement

and then the devil came into our
 valley

  the devils proxy was ambrose lam-
ing northford and you will remember
the name was he not the grandson of
barnabas northford founder of a great
fortune whose vast estates extend for
miles near tuxedo was he not the son
of that financial wizard whose name
stands with the goulds and the gateses
and the fiskes symbols of power and
wealth in the fighting wall street days
of our fathers innocents that we were
in the valley we knew little of those
things then for there were few newspap-
ers up there and we did not know why
this man should have come suddenly in-
to a wilderness retreat among us

  but that was in 

  the northford mansion on the large
acreage bordering on the whatleys
place was suddenly thrown open new
servants appeared a horseless carriage
-the first automotive vehicle in the val-
ley-and a fine stable of horses fre-
quently an imposing well-groomed man
was seen riding about followed by a body-
servant on a lesser nag roaming over our
hills he remained aloof he affected a
dignity and a hauteur which defeated
our simple offers of conversation grim
and hard he seemed and there was
something in his stern handsome mus-
tached face that made us all wonder

  it was perhaps inevitable that north-
ford and judith should meet i do not
know how it came about but soon enough
they were to be seen together seated on
those fine horses riding about for all the
world-and galeg rukker-to see

  then mawm rukker came down from
the houvenkopf to see me in my office

  my father in his time had been the
only valley man whom the jackson
whites trusted and respected and on
his death i inherited that trust how-
ever little it was merited

  there was hurt and anger and puz-
zlement in the old mans eyes as he
the devil came to our valley



stood there towering above me in my
study

  yoong doc he said in that half-
negro half-germanic speech of the hill
people mine galeg he haf tooken lil
judy for to be hisn wooman butten she
goo a-ridin by dot man mine galeg
he will bring troppel much troppel
ifn you tell dot man maybe dere is no
troppel

  they stand together those people of
the hills they love young they love
once and a mans chosen woman needs
no benefit of clergy for her protection
troppel there would be trouble in-
deed with the rukkers in this mind

  so i drove to the northford place and
visited with the man

  dark strong hard grim he was and
mine was a useless errand he sneered

  are you perchance trying to interfere
in my personal affairs doctor borsden
he asked me or are you merely tak-
ing sides with these half-breeds against
society let me tell you once and for
all that i am quite able to take care of
myself

  he showed me out and i felt that i
had done harm and not good

steadily the situation grew worse as
judith became more and more civi-
lized and here i cannot blame mrs
whatley dead years ago poor lady for
what she did was natural enough nev-
ertheless it was the missionarys wife
who guided judiths social development
clad in new and brighter clothes a ve-
neer of the city fitting over her wood-
land elfin character the girl was tak-
en from farmhouse to homestead to
bring her out as mrs whatley phrased
it spending many an evening with the
gentry of the region and their somewhat
dowdy if prosperous wives the day
came when ambrose northford break-
ing all precedent apparently for he was
usually distant with his neighbors
threw wide open the doors of his mansion
and crowded the magnificent old place
with people the whatleys-and ju-
dith with them-were prominent among
the guests and although i wasjiot in-
vited i learned that the charming young
girl was the belle of the evening at that
rather overdrawn party gossip was born
and it was cruel toward judith

  uppish little hussy it was said
imagine it acting up with that north-
ford fellow just as if she was somebody

  gossip was born and grew and gossip
was fanned into caustic fire when the

report was circulated through the val-
ley that little judith had accepted a
place as housekeeper for ambrose
larning northford

  that child a housekeeper t ran the
comment well we know what that
kind of housekeeper is-the little hussy 

nevertheless the fact of judiths

elevation to a higher social status was
evident enough nor did the more preten-
tious of our valley neighbors abstain
from teas and occasional gatherings in
the northford mansion even although
the new yorker treated them with an
obvious assumption of superiority

  soon enough judith began to be seen
in northfords wheezing car smartly
dressed in costumes brought from the
citys mart or mounted on one of her
employers fine horses in a swagger rid-
ing habit-a creature of poise of dignity
and of beauty a transformed cinderella
who had found her prince charming

  and then the tragedy started

  from my own window i witnessed its
beginning i saw northford and judith
charging down the little valley where
the winding road leaps a brook and falls
over into hohokus township five hun-
dred yards or so from my own doorway
i saw the tall massive form of galeg
rukker suddenly emerge from the bushes
and stand straight and stiff in their
path i saw the two horses stop and i
witnessed a pantomime of violent speak-
ing between the men

  and of a sudden northford jumped
from his horse and stood squarely in
front of the young hill-man menacing
and squat like the heavy bull confront-
ing the lithe tiger i saw a blow i
saw the two men rush together i saw
judiths horse plunge and turn and come
tearing up the hillside toward my house
and then i saw the man northford on
the ground and galeg standing over him

  i ran from my study i could hear
judiths screams from over the ridge and
when her horse came tearing into my
driveway she charged down upon me
reining her mount strongly and still
screaming

  hell kill him doctor oh dont let
him-dont-dont  she cried and then
she sank overcome on the gravel road

  i picked her up and seated her gently
against a tree then i ran forward over
the ridge

  galeg rukker was walking slowly and
thoughtfully toward me his head down
his feet dragging


the blue book magazine

                a shot rang out below us anil i hoard a cry farther down the
                path we hurried trusting to instinct and judiths knowledge
                of the hills my lantern rays discovered a prone figure moan-
                ing in agony it was barron whatley shot through the chest

                                                                                                            f
the devil came to our valley



  i saw it galeg i said i cant
blame you my boy but that is no way
to do things

hell be needing your help doc
said galeg wheres judy

  back there i said pointing and
shell be needing your help too i imag-
ine then i hurried on to where north-
ford lay sprawling

   unconscious he was and cruelly beat-
 en he was a big man too-broad of
 shoulder and massive as a gorilla but
 he was no match for the young giant of
 the hills i think galeg rukker at that
 time was even more powerful than his
 huge father i worked on the man and
 he recovered slowly sitting up and wip-
 ing the blood from his face

   im sorry for this northford i told
 him i tried to warn you you know
 his only answer was a growl and a
 glare and as he stalked away whistling
 for his horse which stood browsing near-
 by i knew that there would be a sequel
 to this unfortunate incident

  back in my driveway galeg and ju-
dith were talking the boy standing awk-
wardly yet nobly and the girl sitting up
against the tree where i had left her
she was crying softly

  oh galeg she was saying cant
you see cant you understand i
wanted you to leave the houvenkopf and
educate yourself-to be somebody i
wanted you to want to i tried to show
you    but you wouldnt see id have
waited for you-

  you know i cant leave my father
said galeg simply and quietly he
wouldnt understand

  you could have helped him more if
you had learned how to live-how to mix
with people-how to make money to live
on oh cant you see i cant live that
life of the hills any longer its all
changed now and i cant-love you-
that way-not that old way galeg im
going to marry mr northford galeg

saw the boy stiffen at that i saw
the color leave his face and a pallor
come over him

   judy he said slowly and with- great
 pain in his voice yo cant do that to
 me yo married me judy an yo be
 my wife we didnt get ourselves mar-
 ried in no church but that dont make
 no diffrence youre my woman if yo
 want a church weddin ill get yo one
 yo dont love that city feller judy its
 clos yo loves an automobiles an a big
 house dont yo make no mistake judy

yo aint his kind o people yo belongs
up on our mountain if yo plants a
wood posy in a garden yo gets a dead
flower if yo takes one of our wild dogs
an puts him in a city yo gets a dead
dog them folks dont want yo judy
that man aint goin for to keep yo yo
aint never goin to belong to nobody else
but me    judy dont yo know that

  i could see fear creep into her face-
stark fear fright of truth she sagged
her head fell forward into her arms and
the tears came

  and then suddenly and with almost a
single movement galeg rukker caught
the girl up in his arms and crushed
her to him and before i could fathom
his gesture he had sprung away running
with her in his arms-she crying and
beating at him with her little fists-
running to where her horse stood brows-
ing and threw her across the neat pad
of an english saddle flinging himself up
behind her and tearing across the fields
toward the houvenkopf with the girl
dangling like a sack of grain

two state troopers called at my house
that afternoon and with them was
ambrose larning northford not the
trained educated troopers of today were
these mounted soldier-policemen but cyni-
cal hard adventurers in uniform

  speak up now doctor wheres the
woman they demanded

  i pointed to the mountain

  looks like theres a felony some-
where and youd better be careful how
youre mixed up in this were taking
that boy for assault weve had just
about enough of these hill-billies any-
how

  northford said nothing but as they
rode off i saw trouble in his eye

  it takes about an hour either on foot
or on horseback to climb the houven-
kopf the only pass is steep sharp
treacherous-impassable in bad weath-
er and it was just about an hour after
this interview that i heard two shots
ring out far up in the high forest deer-
hunters this was spring and the deer
were not in season but i had no time
for speculation for there was another
visitor at my gate

  it was the young missionary burran
whatley

  theres trouble doctor he said
and ive come to you because you are
the only man who knows the hill people
that wild man mawm rukker came
down to the cabin and took all my young-


the blue book magazine

ters away he told us to get out he
said-as nearly as i can understand it-
that if we didnt leave the valley tonight
hed burn our place he was really fright-
ful ive never seen such a savage fel-
low in my life im not exactly afraid
of course-but theres mrs whatley to
consider what in the world does it
mean

  i told him

  and i think youd better take ruk-
kers advice and go-for a while at
least if this blows over you can begin
again

  the poor chap went away troubled and
shaking his head

it was quite late that evening when the
two troopers came back to my house
they came afoot and they were both in
fairly bad shape-one shot through the
shoulder and the other with his skull
cracked from blows of a club

  those damned hill-billies they
shouted at me they shot our horses
on the rock crest of the mountain and
then winged at us we pushed over the
hill to fight them but there was a gang
of about thirty men with rifles one of
them took a pot-shot at me this was
the man with the gunshot wound talking
and they beat hell out of my pal here
well get a posse together this very night
and drive them right out of the country
now you fix us up and see damned well
that you keep out of this we know
your sympathies doc one trick out of
you and youll land in jail

  that was all very well but i had no
intention of letting the valley farmers
start a war with the jackson whites
there are some five thousand of these
queer wild people scattered through a
dozen or more colonies all over the ram-
apos and the raising of a posse would
mean nothing less than war bloody
war stupid useless war

  so that night i slipped away quietly
and climbed up the mountain-side to talk
with mawm rukker

  have you ever climbed a rugged little
mountain-even a little one like the
houvenkopf-at deepest night with the
mossy rocks all slimy under your feet
from the springtime drizzle  with crawl-
ing things scurrying around you with
the woods so dark and dense that you
cant see your own hands with the
knowledge that a misstep in some places
is certain death-your body rolling down
a sheer stony ledge and dashing into the
rocks of the swift-shallow ramapo river

underneath  imagine that and then
imagine the added knowledge that any
minute some marksman who has never
missed in his life may take a pot-shot
at you before asking who you are

  but i got up there somehow i got
to thficrest where the little hovels of the
jacks seem clustering and nestling shoul-
der to shoulder as though to keep warm
and i called out to mawm rukker giv-
ing my name and trusting in god that
some one didnt shoot me out of sheer
excitement

  however the great mans form loomed
up against the light of a flaming torch
at the sound of my voice and he called
out

  ifn yo coom a frien yoong doc step
oot here und show butten coom yo
agin usn yo best goon back

  i stepped over the rocks into the strang-
est gathering of humans i have ever
witnessed

  picture them for yourself-picture a
circle of some two hundred men and
women-black or brown half of them
cynical indian faces drawn pinched
yellowing faces of degenerates deformed
skulls deformed limbs deformed bodies
shrunken little men and women huge
tall fellows of italian cast or mayhap
portuguese who were not rightly of the
jacks but had joined them escaping from
the laws of civilization picture them
in tatters in trousers stolen from your
own clothesline and shirts roped about
them in the middle like russian blouses
fat squaws there were with broad
haunches and broad cheek-bones the
pure-blooded descendants of the tusca-
roras lean hungry youths there were
with that shifty half-sodden look of the
drunkard

  and there was a fine new rifle in the
hand of each man and woman however
poor the jacks may be they can all
somehow afford a rifle

  this was a council of war this was
trouble this was a peril to our quiet
valley a peril brought there by the devil
in the person of a fellow named north-
ford-and by the caprices of a foolish
too-quickly-educated girl

and then i saw judith she stood
 there staring at me by galeg ruk-
kers side gone were her fine clothes her
swagger riding-habit she stood there
leaning on the boys arm full of fear full
of worry full of puzzled resentment and
terror at the bees-nest that was buzzing
around her
the devil came to our valley



  i started talking

  i have come to warn you i said
the state troopers are raising a posse
im not going to talk about right and
wrong im only going to tell you that
if you fight with the law youll have a
bloody war that will not stop until the
militia-the soldiers with machine-guns
and field cannon-have driven you all
from the mountain for gods sake
stop and think judith do you see what
youve done you will be responsible
for the death of all these people the
valley people will set fire to the moun-
tain theyll burn your village youve
got to come back with me

  and on i went i pointed to their
tiny one-room hovels-built of logs and
stolen boards i pointed to their scrawny
children peeking frightened out of the
paneless windows- i told them it was
murder to carry this vengeance on i
pleaded and i begged them to release the
girl and let her go back and they lis-
tened silently drunkenly most of them
-and stupidly there was muttering
among them and dissension and clamor
one burly squat wild-looking fellow
with a graying beard that flowed like
moss or lichens over his swarthy face
screamed at me insanely flourishing his
rifle but the others quieted him and
mawm rukkers booming voice silenced
them all as he said these words

  whuch law is ut in yo valley dot
take away a man his wooman 

how could i answer how could i
spend precious minutes to teach
these simple people the ways of civiliza-
tion alul to explain the paradoxes of
what we are pleased to call justice

  i said only

  galeg took the girl by force mawm
rukker and force cries out for force in
reply do you hold the girl here against
her will will she stay by her man-
your son-while the blood of all of you
is spattered over the stones give the
girl her choice mawm rukker i
pleaded let her stay-or come back
with me if she will

  fine old patriarch that mat- and
there was a straightforward justice in
him that needed no urging he stood
there against the flickering light ponder-
ing and i could see the battle of mind
that was going on within him

  but he made no answer-not then
instead it was the girl judith who spoke
stepping away from galeg into the cen-
ter of-the people

  ill go back she said and her voice
was tortured and low let me go back
with the doctor i did this thing ill
have no blood shed on my account
judy galeg rukker strode out
to her lifting her high from the ground
in his huge arms judy-yoll not leave
me now yo wouldnt do that

  put me down galeg

  he did slowly every eye was on
them then judith went on a little
tremulously sadly with great effort
ill go back she said i do not
love galeg a woman has a right to
choose her own man take-me-back
doctor borsden-quickly    hurry
then she tottered toward me and
sank slowly to the ground before i could
catch her and hold her steady

galeg again started forward but
mawm rukker stopped him

  no galeg yoll not tech dot woom-
an usnll do better shoold she goo ifn
a wooman not lof her man den uts no
goot butten the yoong doc can tell
them doon dere dot the river marks oor
coontry well haf not o dere schoolin
und ifn dey coom op on the mountain
uts bullets deyll git from ourn peoples
that was all i knew it i knew that
no more talk would serve i led the girl
out of the flaming ring of faces and
over the ledge of rock where the narrow
path winds down the mountain and
soon enough we were lost in the black of
forest night with only the low murmur
of voices above us to tell us that the
jackson whites were still there still
watchful still full of hate and hurt to-
ward the outer civilized world

  and judith was crying softly

  oh god what have i done what
have i done she was saying over and
over theyre my people  i cant
-i cant let anything happen to them-
to galeg

  and i knew then that it was galeg
rukker and not that hard northford
man whom she loved was this sacrifice
was this ambition was this some per-
verted obstinacy of a young girl whose
head was turned i didnt know then

  a shot rang out below us and to the
right and i heard a cry farther down
the path we hurried as best we could
scrambling over dangerous ledges trust-
ing to my instinct and to judiths long
knowledge of the hills my hand-lan-
tern was none too bright but its rays
could not fail to discover the prone
dark heaving figure that dung to a bush


the blue book magazine

and moaned in agony some twenty feet
below us

  it was burran whatley the missionary
shot through the chest and bleeding
terribly who could have done that
why was he there  had mawm rukker
and his resentful people run amok after
all were we to be plunged into the
bloodshed i had tried so hard to avoid

i picked him up in my arms while
judith frightened and weeping opened
his clothes and tried to stanch the flow
of blood with a handkerchief a kindly
but ascetic face had the reverend bur-
ran whatley and even with the print of
suffering written plainly on it there was
warmth in him humanity in him

  he was revived a little by our move-
ment of his body and he managed to
open his eyes

  dont tell the men-below he fal-
tered theyre-coming i tried-tried
to warn-

  and then he fainted again or per-
haps he diedthen for he never regained
consciousness after that

  dont tell the men he had said and
i knew that this frail ascetic man had
had the courage to brave the hill folk in
spite of their threats to burn his school
and to warn them a posse was coming

  but the posse came we had no time
to hide the body of whatley for they
crept up on us of a sudden calling out
and challenging us as they peered over
a cleft of rock covering us with their
rifles

  i gave my name i heard northfords
hard voice saying

  you see hes playing right in with
these hill-billies better arrest him now
and hold him

  theres a hurt man here i called
out its whatley the missionary some
of you better help me down with him
and then i saw them move carefully up
toward me

  there were only ten or so for the
farmers of the valley were not likely to
join such a posse in large numbers dis-
like the mountain people they did but
they had respect for those dead-shot
rifles and they wanted peace then the
light of their lanterns fell on judith who
had stood silent still crying gently

  it was one of the troopers who spoke

  hell heres yer girl mr northford i

  she did not move

  judith the mans voice rang out
sharp and commanding judith whats
all this about did they hurt you girl

  she said nothing

  judith he cried coming up to her
but the rest of the scene was lost in
the excitement over whatley i only
saw northford take her by the hand and
try to draw her to him she was stiff
and diffident and silent and unyielding
but sfie- let him lead her away a few
paces down the steep path

  then the fury broke

  whatleys dead-theyve killed him
its that devil rukker come on boys
lets go after them

  i tried hard then i tried hard to dis-
suade them to show them the stupidity
of perpetuating this fight of starting a
feud that would make the ramapo river
run red with blood but it was no use
they laughed at me they jeered at
me they called me nigger-lover and
charged up the mountain all but two
who carried the body of the dead mis-
sionary mournfully back to his waiting
widow

 and i stumbled slowly back to my
farm knowing that by the morrow there
would be a living hell in the valley

  judith i did not see her go i did
not see her led away by the triumphant
northford but i knew secretly and
tragically that her sacrifice had been in
vain that she loved galeg rukker and
not this suave city man and all his ill-
gotten money

ell in our valley

all night long there were shots
crackling in the forest of the houvenkopf
word of whatleys death had spread
like wildfire and more of the farmers
joined the posse indignant that this
good young man should have been how-
ever mistakenly a victim of this stupid
blood-feud

  and in the morning looking in terror
from my window i could see a fierce
column of smoke at the top of the moun-
tain where raging flames lighted by
blind rage were devouring the green
firs and the maples-burning the pathetic
little cabins of the jackson whites
whose only real fault was that they had
stood by one another were loyal to each
other that they believed in the sacred-
ness of a simple pledge of troth

  well burn those devils out the
troopers had said and they felt them-
selves justified   

  a blood-feud in new jersey within
thirty miles of new york today you
can follow a state route where the ce-
ment automobile trail has cut through
the devil came to our valley



the houvenkopf laying bare and naked
a tiny cluster of one-story shacks ex-
posing the very souls of these forest
people to the eyes of tourists and you
would never suspect what fearsome his-
tory has been lived there you can see
the brown black yellowish or tainted
white skins of the people who stare at
you as you whirl through their little
city peeking timidly out of their
doors and you would never guess the
fierceness that once was theirs but
turn back the pages of history read the
old newsprint of those early days of this
century and you find yourself plunged
into an era of warfare bloodshed race-
hatred and blind stupid savagery which
rivals anything you have learned of the
mountain feuds of tennessee

  law and justice-strange ambiguous
words are those they admit of a thou-
sand interpretations they vary with
the soil and with the climate and with
the state of peoples souls what is
justice in timbuctoo may be a crime in
hoboken and if those two remote points
were somehow to be thrown together
who should mete out justice which would
be just for both

  there had been a murder the death
-unwarranted and inexplicable-of bur-
ran whatley could not under our civil-
ized laws go unpunished but there
had been a wanton destruction of the
homes of the jackson whites nor could
that blind rage-built crime pass with-
out vengeance under the code of those
simple people and thus the feud began
the houvenkopf is not the onlysettle-
ment of the jacks in the ramapos
thousands of those people are scattered
in small hidden clusters throughout the
mountains and when our settlement
was driven by fire from the houvenkopf
they took shelter with their cousins
clamoring for vengeance

  clannish were our farmers and that
brought cruelty cruel it was that the

whole settlement of the jacks should
have been devoured by the flames of
anger that the crest of our magnificent
mountain should have been consumed in
the fire of intolerance what a per-
verted thing justice can be and when
the smoldering ruins of those straight
firs and lace-like maples were mere cold
ashes-as though the mountain had
doffed its cap and revealed only a bald
tired aged skull as though death had
worn a toupee-the farmers of our val-
ley drew a breath of greater ease as if at
last some menace had been driven away
as if that pyre had been a symbol of a
new safety for them

  but this ease was not to last

  not long after that tragedy the rumor
of northfords impending marriage to
judith filtered through the valley

  well hissed mrs farmwife its
about time something was done imagine
a thing like that going on under our
very noses but i cant understand how
he could actually marry her

  bustle was apparent at the northford
estate servants were busy windows
were shut in with heavy blinds as though
the very soul of the great house might
escape during its owners absence storm-
doors were erected barns and stables
locked those fine horses shipped away
to a more southerly climate

  and lastly one day the great noisy
automobile of ambrose northford was
seen to leave his wooded driveway roar-
ing down the hill road toward the turn-
pikes junction the goggled figure of
northford himself at the wheel and be-
side him the duster-clad form of a
woman whose face was concealed under
an immense motoring-veil and by a pic-
ture hat such as was worn in those
days it could only have been judith

our hill road of hard-packed earth
passes through a heavily wooded acre
or two before it plunges down into the
lower valley where begins the broad
state highway a small boy engaged in
shooting at sparrows or squirrels in this
wood saw the car pass and ran after
them a bit since an automobile was still
	the blue book magazine

something of a phenomenon in those
days as the car rounded the last turn
the boy heard the crack of a rifle a
scream a crash running faster he saw
the car laboring in the ditch its rear
wheels whirring and tossing a futile
stream of dirt its driver slumped over
the wheel he saw also a tall bushy
red-headed man bending over the tonneau
and lifting the inert form of the woman
from the car

  and the boy frightened in the face of
death saw the man carry his limp bur-
den into the trees and there disappear
then he ran breathlessly and reported
what he had seen to his father who in
turn telephoned the incredible news to
the sheriff in suffern

  who had fired that shot who had
killed ambrose northford found drilled
cleanly through the head still gripping
the wheel of his car imagination and
fancy gave the answer mawm rukker
popular legend born of suspicion and not
a little senseless fear gave the answer
mawm rukker and so in every local
barber-shop in every post office and
country store where men congregate
there appeared a printed placard want-
ed for murder  mawm rukker of the
houvenkopf jackson-white settlement

  the sheriff aided by the state troop-
ers organized another posse numbering
more than fifty men to march or ride
through the entire region and to hunt
down the alleged murderer mawm
rukker-wherever he might be found
this simple old man-to me so harmless
and so loyal-was singled out as a sym-
bol of menace both murders that of
whatley and of northford were charged
against him despite the fact that it was
patently impossible that he could have
committed the first and that the ex-
cited testimony of a small boy merely
suggested him in the second case

the little army of vigilantes crossed
over the taurn over the houvenkopf
over the lowly mountains of the region
bursting into squalid settlements where
frightened women and round-eyed chil-
dren cringed in their evil-smelling huts
and babbled nothingness in answer to the
questions-threatening questions-which
were hurled at them but they found
no men it seemed as though all the
male members of the jackson race had
suddenly vanished evaporated into thin
air armed to the teeth with shotguns
and rifles the farmers had expected
pitched battle but not a shot greeted

them in any one of the villages and
mawm rukker  he had not been seen
the women were dumb speechless in-
coherent

  a pack of bloodhounds procured from
a considerable distance was set upon the
trail the pack outdistanced the men
vanished in full cry up the side of the
wanaque watershed and disappeared
those dogs never returned no trace of
them was ever found again

on the third day of the search a party
of vigilantes swept through the bear
pond swamp crossing the ramapo
river intending to beat through the
near-jungle of the highest range leading
with them on leashes another pack of
bloodhounds there is a sharp dip in
the land lower even than the swampy
pond but dry enough for careful foot-
travel just before the sheer steep of the
mountain rises up to meet the county
line and when the party reached this
valley-within-a-valley death suddenly
swooped down upon them

  not gunshots not a frenzied charge
of the mountain people a new unsus-
pected savage horrible death closed in
upon them like an avenging fury only
two men terribly torn and bleeding
were able to drag themselves through to
hilburn and the story they told is al-
most unbelievable

  the first warning of danger came when
the bloodhounds fierce beasts them-
selves began whimpering and shaking
and refused to go on dusk was closing
down slowly and visibility was not of
the best but there was no sign of any
lurking trouble

  then with a howling snarl the ter-
rible wild dogs of the ramapos swarmed
over those men in a black wave of de-
struction 

  the thing seems unbelievable today
and yet even now when the ramapos are
enlaced by cement roads and peopled by
new bright settlements where houses
are modern and sanitary where police
uniforms abound where factories send
their smoke to mingle with the age-old
clouds-even in this day the wild dogs
sometimes appear in full packs vicious
destructive savage beyond credibility

  and these werewolves these phantom
hounds gathered in a foraging pack
hurled themselves upon those men it is
reported that they numbered hundreds
charging down into that narrow ravine as
though their pack-leader were a sagacious
general who knew his military tactics
the devil came to our valley



no chance for firearms quarters were
too close and light was bad and there
was danger of shooting one another

  the survivors of this terrible slaughter
report how the bristling monsters sud-
denly loomed out of cover fangs bared
bloodied their muzzles a-froth useless
to club with shotguns useless to flay at
the beasts with branches pelt them with
stones slash at them with hunting-knives
they came like the onslaught of multi-
fold death suddenly like a wolf-pack
tearing their prey as the wolf tears the
roebuck lean and black and famished
they were and fearless in their mad
hunger they overwhelmed the men
with sheer numbers they snarled like
demons incarnate a very hell opened
up in that swampy valley as the terrible
beasts slashed men down tearing them
rending them devouring them

  and then suddenly-as suddenly as
they had appeared they vanished

  a shrill whistle sounded up on the
mountain-side so goes the report and the
dog-pack paused in their bloody battle-
paused and then vanished into the gloom
of the trees leaving only the torn shreds
of what had been that posse of vigilantes

  whistle  a whistle is a human sound
what human agency could have given
that signal  what man-being could have
had empire and mastery over such savage
brutes

  two of the posse escaping somehow
from the fate of the others were able to
drag their painful ways back to the little
settlement of hilburn there to tell the
story gasping in agony of their hurts
a man had been seen they said a fab-
ulous man a creature of legend had
stood silhouetted against the falling sun
high on a rocky ledge it had been he
who whistled tall he was and bushy
and armed with a rifle he had stood
there and whistled fingers in his mouth
and the dogs had vanished

  and the legend gave birth to an answer
the man could only have been mawm
rukker the wild man of the hills

mawm rukker mawm rukker-
keeper of the beasts they called
him wild man of the mountains they
called him the dog-man they called
him-murderer fiend ghoul vampire
dig into that old volume of newspapers
now sere and yellow which your fathers
cherished so preciously dig into it and
browse through it see the records of that
story see the trial and the conviction of
mawm rukker learn what prejudice and

fertile imagination can do what a curse
it can bring upon the head of a man in-
nocent of all criminal intent whose only
crime is the protection of his home loy-
alty to his son obedience to the oldest of
all laws that of an eye for an eye

from trenton and from albany came
the authority to mobilize the state
militia a state of siege was declared
on the mountains the counties of
bergen and rockland and sussex and
passaic were to become camping-grounds
for grim soldiery armed with machine-
guns and fine rifles the iron hand of
civilization once and for all was to
reach out and grasp these little people
and bring them by force into the herd of
law-abiding rule-of-thumb citizens

  and the goal of all this mobilization
the aim of it was the capture of an aging
tiring uncomprehending man old mawm
rukker

  but it never came to pass

  one day two bony nags rode into the
town of suffern mounted on one of
them was a woman-a mere girl almost
-dressed in the ragged branch-torn
clothing of the hill folk and upon the
other carrying his long rifle across his
back his head bowed his red bush hat-
less in the breeze was mawm rukker
crowds followed them in the street but
they saw them not a murmur arose be-
hind them 

  its rukker-its that mountain devil
lynch him-kill him-string him up
but no hand was laid upon them

  they rode to the office of the state
troopers there they climbed down from
their nags and entered the door they
confronted a blue-uniformed captain at
his desk and the girl judith made this
statement	

  mawm rukker has come to give him-
self up he is guilty of nothing he
committed no murders he is doing this
to save his people send your soldiers
back and let the hill people alone give
this man a fair trial and set him free we
dont want any more bloodshed or any
more death

 and the rumbling voice of mawm
rukker boomed out

  yis dot is right dere is too mooch
too many off mine peoples are dead too
many off your peoples are dead yo haf
want me now i coom

  keeper of the beasts they called
him -devil-man-wild man of the
mountains did it never occur to them
that this man was also a father
	the blue book magazine

  the trial was held in hackensack the
government seat of bergen county the
passage of time lends an atmosphere of
implausibility to the facts of that fan-
tastic assize but the account visible in
the bergen county chronicle for all
time will reveal to what heights of hys-
teria public emotion could rise and
mawm rukker that primitive simple
man who had surrendered himself only in
order that his fellow-men might live was
condemned even before the judge was
seated at the bench

  thirty-two witnesses for the state
two witnesses for the defense thirty-
two men unknowingly perjured them-
selves to condemn to death a bewildered
ignorant uncomprehending man two
persons-the girl judith and myself-
tried vainly to move the hardened hearts
of those twelve jurors to whom the name
jackson white meant only outcast only
savagery

let me give you a picture of mawm
j rukker standing in the prisoners
dock let me paint for you a creature
of the wilds confined restive dazed
towering over the mere men of that
crowded room and its morbidly curious
like some primitive god let me show
you a shouting bullying prosecutor howl-
ing phrases and sentences at the bushy
nimrod shaking an accusing finger
smirking insinuating ranting and acting
a pantomime of which mawm rukker
understood not a single word or gesture

  now my man said the prosecutor
as reported by the chronicle you admit
coming down to the mission school of the
late burran whatley and driving away
the young children whom he was instruct-
ing in christianity and other learning
and telling him to leave the valley or
you would burn his cabin in other
words you admit threatening him
come speak up-answer yes or no
yis uts true dot i haf coom down-

  there your honor the man admits
the threat now let us examine-
then again that insufferable prosecu-
tor would shout at rukker

  so you admit the possession of a
rifle-specifically a - of the type
knoyyi as a pump-action repeater whose
bullet would make just such a wound as
was found in the body of the late am-
brose larning northford  you admit it
dont you you brought such a rifle with
you when you came down to suffern
you admit owning it dont you an-
swer me rukker

  and the bewildered old man replied
falteringly

  dot is a goot gun butten i haf no
steal ut i haf pay for ut mineself
whyen you haf tooken my gun 

  and still again

  you say you did not cause the dogs
to attack the sheriffs posse but you
admit that you sometimes feed those wild
creatures you admit that you have
often shot a deer or other game-illicit-
ly and out of season too-and left the
carcass for the wild dogs in other words
you were friendly with the dogs were
you not they knew you and they
would obey you

 de dogs yis i haf feed dem many
times

  so they follow you through the hills
eh

  sometime maybe dey coom near me
yis but-

  you admit that do you and how
do you call them when you havekilled a
deer

  maybe i haf whistle de dogs dey
coom-

  so they come when you whistle eh
and yet you claim you did not set the
dogs on those men was it you who
whistled for them to come away 

  yis i coom doon whan i haf hear
troppel doon dere an when i see dem
dogs fight by dose men i whistle
thats right you whistled and the
dogs came away up to you but how do
you explain the fact that the dogs were
there-the whole pack together-when
the posse was looking for you just how
can you explain that  tell us rukker
the court wants to know

  maybe i haf not understood so goot
mistah de dogs dey roon always to-
gedder lak dat coom springtime maybe
dey want for to kill sheeps maybe cows
i don know whan i see dem kill de
mens i try stop dem i whistle dey
coom-dats all i know
the devil came to our valley



  a likely story your honor perhaps
we have here not a murderer but a hero
i shall not presume to interpret this re-
markable coincidence however i shall
leave it to the keen discretion of the
jury

  rukker the murderer

can see a pale wan little girl in the
witness-box holding out her hands
pleading spilling tears pouring out a
heart full of regret of fear of tragic
hope i can hear her again saying those
words

  cant you see your honor if there
is any fault it is mine i do not know
who it was who killed mr whatley but
it wasnt mawm rukker    he was
in his house with his son and me until
i went back with the doctor some of
the men were posted as sentries they
would have shot at anyone they were
only trying to protect me they be-
lieved i was married to galeg-its the
way they do things in the hills they
believed mr northford was taking me
away-from my man my husband they
couldnt understand they thought the
whole valley wanted to take me away
it was my fault i couldnt make them
know they couldnt understand how i
could go off and marry mr northford
when i was already married to galeg
rukker-their kind of marriage

  then the prosecutors suave voice
brought shame to the girl

  your honor he said i am forced
to admire and to approve the plausible
confession of guilt on the part of this
young woman undoubtedly she is
fundamentally to blame but this is not
the trial of a young woman who wanted
luxury instead of a log cabin this is
the trial of a man for the charge of mur-
der this young woman-called i be-
lieve simply judith and wanting another
name-appears as a witness in behalf of
the accused one can but admire the
stanchness of her-shall i say plea-in
behalf of the father of her-ah-lover
yet it is the right-may i say the duty
-of the prosecution to discredit if pos-
sible any witness upon contingent
grounds i regret exceedingly this duty
but your honor and gentlemen of the
jury i cannot but perform my duty in
exposing to you another face of this
seemingly noble young woman-a face
may i say less agreeable less-ah-
noble-

  i can remember the suspense the
cleverly created tension in the pause

tlic dogs knew you and would obey
you    yet you claim you did not
set the dogs on those men

he paused again and then lifting his
voice shaking his finger at the girl
he roared

  but ambrose larning northford was
a married man

   shocked silence

   i will produce certified copies of the
records to prove that mr northford had
been married these ten years and that
his wife was and is not only alive but
that he was in constant correspondence
with her therefore gentlemen-there-
fore your honor-it becomes apparent
that the witness was not and could not
have been undertaking a trip with the de-
ceased which was to end in lawful matri-
mony

that followed this remark i can re-
member the astonished look in the eyes
of judith the bewilderment of her and
the pitiful expression of hurt and shock
in her face

  the witness your honor he con-
tinued has admitted her presence in
the automobile of the late ambrose
northford at the time of his death they
were she asserts driving to new york
there to be united in holy wedlock


the blue book magazine

  and that is not all in the pockets
of the deceased when the body was
found were discovered passage tickets
on the allen line steamer breresjord
destination liverpool and one of those
tickets was in the name of a certain
judith northford-inscribed as sister of
the deceased    sister your honor-
sister can we be so sure can we be
quite positive that -all of this estimable
young womans words her seeming
nobleness her urgent pleas are not
moved by an impulse of that oldest of
human vices-cupidity covetousness  i
rest my case your honor

  filthy morbid bitter insinuation
the court was in an uproar spectators
cackled with laughter they hissed and
sneered and as they sneered judith
the nameless sprang blindly to her feet
muttering

  i didnt know-i didnt know   
oh how could they how could he-
then she fainted

  three days for that trial three stupid
blind farcical days of mock-justice my-
self i was browbeaten and sneered at as
a nigger-lover in that court clients
whose lives and the lives of whose chil-
dren i had saved were there sneering and
snarling and on the third day the jury
charged by a confident judge brought
back the verdict guilty

  mawm rukker guilty of murder
mawm rukker guilty of a wholesale
slaughter

  mawm rukker sentenced to death by
hanging

  mawm rukker a puzzled old man not
even understanding why it was that the
morbid crowd cheered not even compre-
hending clearly that he was accused of
what he was accused hardly grasping
why it was that he coming down from
his mountain fastness was held in a tiny
cell badly fed and his hands fastened
with unbreakable steel    mawm ruk-
ker standing up and facing the judge
and saying gently in that vibrant wood-
land voice

  den i kin goo now ut is finish
dere will be no more troppels

  and the crowd sneering sneering with
ironical laughter

  but the moment came

there was a scuffle in the rear of the
courtroom a door was flung open
a handful of guards were flung down
sprawling on the floor the gigantic
figure of a man-bristling unshaven
ruddy his hair gleaming red a scrubby

beard on his face his eyes wild and com-
pelling broke through them and charged
down the aisle

  stop his voice said wait im
galeg rukker im the man yo want
not my father try me not him talk
to me not to him damn yo i

   crash of the gavel

  rush of more court guards

  screams of a startled crowd

  and galeg rukkers voice bellowing

  i killed ambrose northford i
killed him yo hear  i shot him y hear
me  let me talk damn yo all

oh they let him talk even the
warped justice of prejudice could
not refuse that

  you can read galegs single simple
violent statement in the chronicle per-
haps your fathers will have saved it these
years as i have for nothing like it was
ever spoken in any courtroom nor has
any trial ended as did that of mawm
rukker

  slow was the boys speech bookish
was his english and scarcely at all did
he lapse into the strange bastard idiom
of his hill race

  but there was blood in those slow
careful words love in his words hate and
death and loyalty in his words and they
fanned the fierce fire of him standing
there in the courtroom storming at a
jury at a judge at a crowd of stunned
people pouring out the indignation of an
entire race against a civilization that
could in its smug complacency in its
mistaken well-meaningness betray him
and his own people

  listen  he said and the command-
ing power of his words stirred strange
emotions in that stuffy room listen
yo a man takes away my woman-
my wife she is   and i killed him yo
send people up to teach us learnin an
they teach us how were poor they
make my woman ashamed o me an so
she dont want me no more my pop
told him to go away  i mean that mis-
sionary feller he didnt go so i killed
him too what makes you think its my
pop who done that what makes you
think its my pop who set the dogs on
you dyo think a man kin set dogs
like that on anybody  yo send a bunch
of men up in our hills right now an the
dogsll get em yo call yourselfs edu-
cated but im tellin yo youre jest ig-
nrant i aint sorry none i aint done
nothin cept what any man would a
done yo let my pop go he aint done
the devil came to our valley



nothin its me that done it its me
an yo aint goin to tech me neither 
and then before all that roomful of
astounded people that strange lad half
savage half civilized a hybrid-torn by
vague consciousnesses of a morality
which his race before him had forgotten
if ever known slowly sank back on his
bench-and wept

  yes he wept

  there was no other sound in that court
seconds passed in awed silence then
at a slight motion of the judges hand
two court attendants started to move to-
ward him mawm rukker strangling
with emotion stood to his feet a hand
stretched out toward his boy but
swifter than any other movement was
that of the girl judith she was running
across the hardwood floor toward the
boy she was crouching at his side she
was clasping his head in her soft hands
and she was whispering hoarsely
galeg-galeg-its all a lie  tell
them its a lie

but the guard had reached him firm-
ly though with a certain gentleness
they lifted him to his feet in a daze he
seemed mindless of judiths clinging
hands mindless of the people of the jury
upon whose twelve faces-so hard and
unforgiving but a moment since-there
was drops of moisture mindless of the
judges stare and still dazed and un-
resisting he followed the two attendants
out of the room through the little door
that leads to the narrow passage where
prisoners pass we heard the door close
upon him we heard judiths sobbing
we heard mawm rukkers inarticulate
groan

  and then-we heard the muffled roar
of a shot   

  frantically the two attendants tried to
tell it frantically and hysterically they
tried

  hes dead  they cried in concert
hes killed himself he had a gun on
him and now hes dead

  and in the confused murmuring up-
roar which followed that tragic announce-
ment i could see the judges lips-shakily
forming the syllables

  case-state against mawm rukker
-dismissed    ruled-mistrial

  but it was a power greater far than
that of any mere earthly judge which
had spoken and the magistrates un-
heard words were but a weak echo   

  a saint was born in that court-house
let  no devils advocate appear to

challenge her sanctity for if utter repent-
ance utter self-abnegation utter self-
sacrifice and humiliation long service
to humanity and infinite suffering can
engender saintliness that tragic instant
in a worldly judges court engendered
saint judith

  for the crowd the tragedy ended then
blind souls they saw nothing for they
had no eyes to see what was it to those
people-whose morbid curiosity had been
sated whose stupid arrogance had been
stimulated whose vanity had been whet-
ted to witness the to them amusing
drama of a man bereft a son sacrificed a
woman humiliated    what was it to
them i say that this graying old man
so out of place among them should stalk
slowly from the courtroom his straight
figure bent over with sorrow bowed
broken 

  how could any of them translate the
simpler tragedy-the girl that same girl
whose honor they had heard stripped
from her whose naked soul they had
snickered at-the girl reaching her hand
after the old man reaching out touch-
ing his arm saying

  pop  oh pop-take me-with you
   take judy-

  they made way for her through the
pressing crowd they stood aside for
her they lingered there watching her
like hungry ghouls to feed upon dead
spirits they saw the old man shake her
hand away and force his tired body on-
ward they saw her follow him tears
streaming down her face they heard her
cry out after him

  oh pop    oh pop take me
i-i cant-

  and they heard the rumble of his voice
when he turned they heard it and the
fierce torture of the words as they burned
his lips in the saying and the smoldering
embers in the heart of him sent an in-
visible odor of burning into the corridor
as mawm rukker said

  get yo gone wooman dat yo coom
by no hurt from me yo haf kilt mine
galeg

aye they saw and they heard did that
 crowd but it was only a play only
a thing done and said amongst them to
pass and forget to mention perhaps
over their coffee that night saying
well it certainly served the little
hussy right a murderess she is as plain
as daylight too imagine trying to make
up to that old devil after- what a
business what an ugly business


the blue book magazine

  an old man named mawm rukker
strode through the streets of hackensack
never stopping to wonder at the street-
cars fantastic things which he had never
seen before never stopping to see the
crowd that whispered and pointed at him
never hearing the hushed murmurs

   there he goes    mawm rukker
   keeper of the beasts-wild man of
the mountain    its a wonder they let
him go at that 

   through the streets he went but soli-
tary and bowed down striding fast to
free his feet of the very dust of civiliza-
tion striking off through the fringe of
woods to the north and disappearing in
the trees whose branches let down and
caressed him for he was their own

   but it was a saint that he left behind
him

   i found judith-a little gray figure she
was crouched against the banister of the
great staircase in the court building
white-faced a tear falling as though
it were dew from her soul oozing out
of her she yielded to my arm and to-
gether we went to my buggy driving
back to the valley through the brisk air
and the green fields

   theres nothing i can say judith i
told her except that theres a home for
you here in my lonely house-if you want
it youll find work to do there and it
will help you

   she shook her head

   thank you doctor she said but
i cant stay there i cant stay in the
valley and ive plenty of work to do
my place is on the mountain-with my
people mawm rukker will need me
now

   then she trudged away up the steep
path that led to where the mountains
crest had been burned away and i did
not know then that this was a holy
woman

a sad history those next twenty
years but there was beauty in it
and a great lesson i cannot write it
here i cannot write the vast volume
that history would make my story is
done my book is closed that record
is written in a greater book than mine

   but out of that deep tragedy was born
sunshine and goodness it is true that
the jackson white settlement was rebuilt
on the mountain it is true that mawm
rukker an old man already led his
people back to the houvenkopf like
joshua leading israel and that the axes

the

and knives of them cut new branches to
build new cabins for their homes and it
is true that the girl judith crept humbly
into his cabin silent mouselike alone

  they tell the story today in the ram-
apos they tell how mawm rukker
would not speak had never spoken to her
they tell how with silent devotion she
cooked his food and split his wood and
made his place clean and nursed the
man through a long sad life but never a
word was spoken between them and that
was for twenty years

  a saint was judith and she gave of
herself in simple penitence a little clap-
board schoolhouse was built on the moun-
tains edge and there judith brought the
jackson children daily to listen to her
soft voice there she taught them the
simple things she had learned in the mis-
sion school-things which too quickly
absorbed had betrayed her taught them
with love and with understanding

 could fill that volume with the
story of civilizations march into the
mountain the building of its roads
the blooming of a golf-club where once
the northford mansion stood i could tell
you of the vast concrete knife a new
state highway that slashed through the
very heart of the houvenkopf settle-
ment hewing a clean strip of gray past
the doors of those mountain huts all to
the bewilderment of the little hill people
stripping them bare of their privacy rob-
bing them of their hiding-places churn-
ing them willy-nilly into the maelstrom
of a world which closed in around them

  all this and more i could write but
my book is ended myself i have grown
old-sick and old with waiting with
watching with hoping who shall love
a saint  who shall love a holy woman 
it is true indeed that no word of love
was ever spoken between us judith and
me yet we both knew we were waiting

   and now it is over   

   last night the wild dogs of the houven-
kopf set up their howling and i knew
that old mawm rukker was dead had
passed on and was united with galeg his
son the penance is over judith will be
coming down from the mountain now re-
leased from her vow an old woman she
will be but the soul of her will be a
girls soul

  listen perhaps that is she even now
-at my door  at the door of my
house so long empty so long hungry
waiting waiting

this story of the first iron-clad is one of the most
dramatic in all the arms and men series

by h bedford-jones

tn those days france was shaking
 i under the tramp of armies

 x so said etienne de molnay as we
sat together one afternoon in the col-
lectors club and talked of cabbages and
kings molnay was one of the stamp-
collectors who infested the place a slim
graceful man with a far-away look in his
gentle eyes as though he were living back
in the days of his grandfather who had
been some sort of government official
under the third napoleon

  so my grandfather has said he went
on fingering a soiled old envelope he had
taken from his pocket and forgotten
you see napoleon the little as he
was eternally branded by victor hugo
had finally seized the throne and in
 was preparing to prove to the world
that he was as great as the first na-
poleon he was forming armies he was
gathering munitions he was legving no
stone unturned to find new weapons new
arms with which to overwhelm europe
well he succeeded and yet by irony
europe overwhelmed him and he was
remembered not for his new engines of
war but for the frightful cataclysm that
he brought upon france

  i listened with a polite interest talk
of napoleon rather bored me and so far

  as i knew he had never brought forth
  any novel weapons of war suddenly
  molnay recollected the envelope in his
  hand and waved it at me excitedly

    this is remarkable he said look
  while napoleon was president in s
  before he seized the throne this letter
  was sent to him merely addressed to
  m le prince-president paris and sent
  collect anyone could send a letter col-
  lect to the head of the state it was
  charged to the office as this notation in
  the corner affirms but who do you sup-
  pose sent this letter  it turned up in a
  stamp collection it has no stamp
  naturally but collectors subscribe to
  anything well the letter was sent by
  pierre meurdoc

    he seemed to think the words would
  make an impression they did not

    never heard of him i said what
  did he do

    he changed the art of war he re-
  plied you see this envelope it is no
  doubt the very one in which he sent his
  letter to the prince-president introduc-
  ing himself and his idea his invention
  it was this letter which altered the
  worlds history my friend do you
  wonder that i treasure it

    to be frank i do was my smiling



the blue book magazine

menrdoc talked
to tier about his
ship and ubout
lib letter to the
president

response you see i know nothing
about him i never heard of his in-
vention

  you hear of it every day said he
slowly the world has heard of it
ever since     but there-it is
not extraordinary that you never heard
of him perhaps the tale is not widely
known and parts of it-the strange and
horrible finale-are even less known
my grandfather was one of the few who
knew the whole truth and from him i
had it it was he who went aboard the
old glorieux the frigate that served as
target in the bay beyond mont st
michel and who found the end of the
story there

  he was silent for a space his eyes
thoughtful and dreamy then suddenly
he awakened

  you know he said abruptly there
were two facets to the character of na-
poleon he was studious in all the art of
war and he was of unbridled passion
where women were concerned he had
his mistresses also he had his private
arsenal where inventions were furthered
for the sake of france

  well this letter-and he tapped the
envelope in his hand-was sent him
while he was still president it reached
him a day or two after he made himself
emperor no doubt it lay disregarded

for a long time until his attention could
be drawn from greater things but thft
man who sent it was an interesting man
my friend an honorable man a man of
gifts and personality i wish i could
make you see him as my grandfather
knew him you see he lived in the
provinces on the border between nor-
mandy and brittany-

pierre meurdoc lived on the
breton coast in the old house that had
once been a manor of the abbots of mont
st michel out there in the bay lifted
that incredible island of so wondrous ar-
chitecture like a fairy palace rising from
the sea that it was known in older days
by the name of the marvel

  meurdoc was one of those men with
little money whose family ran back to
the conquest the name was old and his-
toric he was twenty-six and useless a
handsome black-haired dreamer a poet
blind to superficial things with fantastic
notions about life and living so said
the breton peasants yet they respected
him because he was very honorable very
brave and gentle with a peculiarly femi-
nine tenderness lurking in his lustrous
black eyes this perhaps made the
sequence of things all the more horrible

  he refused to kill bird or beast and
used to tramp the woods and shores with
the emperor



an unloaded fowling-piece he would
sit by the hour watching the long glisten-
ing sands when the tide ran out and the
folk were digging cockles or the rush
and trample of waves when it came in
you know how it comes around mont st
michel-rapidly faster than a horse can
run sweeping in around the miles of bare
sands very suddenly

  many a man has been engulfed there
the cannon captured from the english
six centuries ago still at the gate of the
mont today were taken this way when
the besiegers were caught by the foam-
ing tide

nor was pierre meurdoc alone on
these walks with him frequently
was gloria de brion last of that family
she lived alone in the ruined house of her
fathers with an ancient godmother

  a girl unutterably lovely as a fairy
fantastically dressed in odd garments
living by hazard but with a wild fierce
heart beneath her rags the peasants
feared her because she had flaming red
hair which they took to be a mark of
the devil in that country she too
dreamed dreams as she walked and sat
on the shores with meurdoc but if she
shared his dreams he did not share hers

  fascination on her part no doubt but
on his a deep and lofty nobility of love
with all the depth and height of the cross
itself they would recite the strangely
moving verses of alfred de musset by
the hour as they gazed across the shin-
ing sands at the sweet fairy pinnacle of
the mont

  but marriage in the provinces this
was no light matter and neither of them
had money meurdocs lands could be
mortgaged but this would leave them
with heavy debt it was a hopeless
situation had they been set on marriage
but what care young wild hearts for the
forms of life they exchanged their
vows to the distant marvel of st michel
they loved they lived

  one day meurdoc took some rabbits
and young pigs to market at avranches
he came back to the utter despair of
his two old servants not with tttfe ma-
terials they needed to stop the gaps in
the roof but with the model of a ship
a frigate a very handsome thing it was
but this would not keep out the rain

  upon this ship model he worked long
and patiently getting the blacksmith at
the village forge to help him with what
he wanted made impulsive ardent fan-
tastic a boy despite his years with a

natural gift for figures and calculations
he said nothing to gloria of his scheme
until it was finished

  la glorieux the peasants called
her the glorious one in their hard-
bitten scorn but pierre meurdoc called
her this in worship and adoration the
name went with her free proud carriage
had she been a fine lady in silks and
furs it went with her slightly chilly blue
eyes her loveliness the fine high set of
her head and neck lovely and glorious
uncontrolled and with a wild fierceness
in her heart to escape her life of poverty
and oblivion do you know this hunger
of the heart sometimes it will lead to
strange and terrible things like all hun-
ger

  a visiting artist charmed by meur-
docs old ruined chateau by the girls
beauty by the high stately courtesy of
meurdoc himself had painted her he
had done a miniature on ivory of her
face and neck and shoulders as a gift to
pierre meurdoc and this rested always
upon the young mans heart

  and one day a weary and blase man
getting on in years one of the most
famous of the old exquisites a very noted
writer of cruel tales had wandered down
the breton coast had seen the girl had
exchanged words with her and given her
his card barbey daurevilly who had
plumbed all the depths of evil and found
them empty and sad these little things
were threads in the plot and trap of des-
tiny for destiny bears a frightful hatred
toward noble and honorable souls

at length his work on the ship model
 was finished he had stripped all
the sails from the little frigate and now
took it in hand slung fowling-piece over
his shoulder and went through the woods
past the brion homestead there he
whistled and hooted like an owl in the
old fashion of the breton chouans and
the girl came running to join him her
red hair flowing wild in the sunlight like
rich ruddy gold her wide blue eyes all
ablaze

  to the shore said he gayly when
they had kissed to show you what
ive been working on these long nights
ma mie down to the little bay where
the water is deep when the tides in it
shoqld be in now you see the ship

  a ship without sails she said
laughing youre a boy again to sail
toy ships but what are those queer
things on the sides

  plates of iron he said proudly ive


the blue book magazine

worked out a way to fasten them secure-
ly to the wood wait and ill show you
come along

  ah and she sighed as she fell in
beside him if you were starting for
paris and said that youd not have to
say it twice

  that remains to be seen he re-
plied smiling paris be damned id
as soon live in the moon as in paris
at least wed have plenty of cheese
to eat in the moon little boy

so they came to a bight of the shore
below pontorson whence at low tide
one might cross the bared sands to the
mont the tide was in and the miracle
of the glorious islet lay opposite glinting
in the sunlight the brown sails of fish-
ing-boats broke the blue water and afar
on the horizon lifted the white topsails of
a frigate bound in for st malo

  when they had settled down near the
water meurdoc showed her the iron-
bound model of the warship

  to figure out the exact thickness of
the plates proportionately so theyll not
sink her in the water was a job he said
proudly but its done shes all
sheathed in iron save the deck

  but to what end the girl asked
ill show you barefoot now he ran
down to the water and splashed in and
put the model to float there she swam
neatly nicely as he came back and
picked up his gun

  now my dear fancy this a frigate
floating under the batteries and this
fowling-piece the cannon of the batteries
that could blow her out of the water-if
she were of wood only 

  he fired the gun crashed the white
powder-smoke spurted and lifted under
the impact of the shot the model frigate
reeled and rocked but when meurdoc
brought the ship back she showed no
sign of hurt save in marks of lead on
iron

  and queried the girl just whats
the reason of all this

  proof that ive discovered some-
thing he exclaimed eagerly look
you suppose france were to sheathe
her ships in such a cuirass of iron then
english or turkish cannon could not
harm them they could laugh at any
enemy you see

  oh she exclaimed well my dear
france is a large place and this corner
of the bay is a very little place

  thats a queer answer he said
staring at her in disappointment

  its not an answer but an observa-
tion she said merrily but pierre this
is really a discovery why dont you
write the prince-president about it
could you tell just how thick the iron
must be to serve on a real ship could
you asswre him its really practical
yes of course write him the
president id never thought of that
said meurdoc simply hed pay no at-
tention to a provincial a rustic like me
the name of muerdoc means nothing
outside brittany

  at least its a name she said in her
enigmatic way write him sendthe
letter with collect charges-one does that
to the president then hell pay more
heed to it if its cost him something -
meurdoc burst into a laugh and as-
sented that same night indeed he
spent hours writing the letter and next
day sent it off in the post but for a
long long time nothing happened

  the winter passed the spring drew in
the world opened again often meurdoc
talked with la glorieux about his ship
his letter to the president and laughed
about it the president was the emperor
now another dream gone glimmering
said he with a shrug

  he and the girl lived in their own
little world  even when the spring opened
all the wide world it was not for them
a savage place these breton woods
savage people were those who lived in
them savage uncouth ignorant in all
these back districts

without warning suddenly came
the letter the village postman bore
it reverently proudly curiously the mas-
sive envelope bore the round stamped
cabinet de lempereur a letter from
the emperor himself for pierre meur-
doc why the thing was incredible
word of it- was flashed all over the
countryside

  meurdoc came running bareheaded
letter in hand to the old brion house
he thrust it at la glorieux incoherent
excited breathless

  read a reply from the secretary
of napoleon he must see me in paris
the emperor himself is interested in my
idea do you comprehend experts have
laughed at it but he is interested he
sends for me for me pierre meurdoc
to paris

  her red lips parted her blue eyes
surveyed him enigmatically

  and you

  he sobered i go to paris certainly
the emperor



now my dear fancy this is a frigate and this
fowling-piece a cannon

i can mortgage the chateati to old cour-
tois the miser then if i succeed no
matter and if i fail no matter  but
i shant fail i know what im about
the dreams come true glorieux-
embrace me

 she embraced him but not in the
manner of dreams come true   

 lands mortgaged for a song post-
chaise rolling on the yellow roads among
the apple-blossoms of normandy a
meurdoc hesitant clad in new awkward
garments at the gates of the tuileries
with the letter in his hand for passport
and so to the private secretary of the
emperor who gazed at him startled

  mon dieu monsieur  you have not
breathed word of your errand to any-
one

  certainly not meurdoc exclaimed
why

  my friend it is of the utmost se-
crecy you must let no word of it pass
your lips until his majesty has talked
with you he desires to see you in pri-
vate well make an appointment-
hm ill send a carriage for you at eight
this evening hes free for half an hour
then

  meurdoc clasped his hand- then
monsieur-he approves of my idea 

  no one else does apparently said
the other dryly hope for nothing i
warn you he will have sharp questions
to ask

  tonight at eight

  a small private salon in the palace
meurdoc waiting choked by excitement

then springing to his feet as the door
opened a small man in heavy uniform
goatee and mustache still black eyes
sharp and shrewd

  well monsieur your name has a
long place in the annals of france-and
the emperor smiled bah no cere-
mony i insist ive spent too many
years in prison to stand on ceremony
with men of brains were alone this
is a business affair your idea mon-
sieur is flatly impossible-according to
all my naval construction experts

  all this while the shrewd sharp eyes
appraising the young man that high
forehead that singular look of nobility
and frank simplicity those lustrous eyes
the firm lips and chin the acute intel-
ligence the red country cheeks

and now questions thick and fast
 and to the point

  with such a weight there is the
handling of the ship to consider out of
the question im told what say you
the attachment of an iron cuirass such
as you propose-a most important point
the thickness of this iron  if sufficiently
thick to resist the balls of cannon will it
not actually sink the ship as im told it
will do

  hands like ice meurdoc conquered
his self-consciousness he took the ar-
guments one by one and tore them to
shreds he answered the questions with
assurance all from a theoretical view-
point not at all he spoke of his
model of how he had tested and worked


the blue book magazine

broadside upon broadside roared from the target echoed a clang us
the solid shot banged against her iron cuirass

with it of how he had fired his gun at it
he had an answer ready and prompt for
the most searching queries if he had
none he invented one and chanced re-
sults

  and napoleon listened until he had
finished

 hm monsieur you almost con-
vince me yet nothing purely theoreti-
cal can be convincing there must be
an actual test an actual ship an actual

broadside of cannon fired can you sup-
ply this

  i your majesty stammered meur-
doc i have no frigates no cannon-
napoleon laughed you mistake me
france can supply all this rather i can
do so this affair must remain utterly
secret between you and me alone you
comprehend  hm there is that old
frigate at st malo condemned-the
glorieux
the emperor	

  the glorieux burst out meurdoc
his face all ablaze oh what a favor-
able omen la glorieux indeed her
very name-

  he broke off in acute embarrassment
smiling napoleon inquired and meur-
doc drew out the miniature and ex-
plained how matters lay for a long
moment those shrewd heavy-lidded eyes
rested upon the painted likeness of glo-
ria de brion then he handed it back

  monsieur i congratulate you now
here is what i propose-first are you
free to act in this matter have you a
salary a profession to tie you down
i have nothing your majesty i
mortgaged the lands and chateau of
meurdoc to come here

  the sharp gaze searched his face as
though in wonder

  very well ill supply everything
from my private purse you shall have
la glorieux and a commission giving
you absolute power to convert her to
arm her with this iron cuirass it cant
be done at brest i want no prying eyes
from the shipyards to see the invention
do it at st malo work with private
armorers your expenses and salary will
be ample my secretary will arrange
everything see him in the morning and
go forth to conquer destiny young man
when you are ready send word ill
come to st malo myself and arrange
the tests understood 

understood  it was dream come
true it could not even be grasped
much less understood in a moment

  behold then meurdoc writing fever-
ishly that night a long long letter to
gloria de brion marriage life together
dreams realized and glowing words of
the emperor of his shrewdness his
kindness his affability all was to be
settled on the morrow then home like
an arrow marriage a journey to st
malo together

  but the morrow brought delays con-
ferences details to iron out red tape to
be cut to place even a condemned old
frigate in the hands of the new dictator
was no easy matter especially as the
reason for doing it remained unknown
french officials held up their hands in
horror the ministry of the marine
nearly had apoplexy

  not until days had passed was every-
thing adjusted and then meurdoc with
fat purse and future assured set off post-
haste for the west home again to
throw gold at his two old servants then

to rush to the ruins of the brion villa
aflame with the elation of triumph

  but no gloria instead a letter await-
ing him with the deaf half-blind old
godmother left alone in her dotage
meurdoc read it with stupefaction then
with joy

  an old friend of my fathers from
paris has carried me off-a real fairy
godfather who came unexpectedly out of
nowhere    the horizon is opening for
me my dear as it is for you a month
two months and you wont know me
when you see me again i swear i
rejoice for your success it shall become
a triumph expect me in st malo in
two months with all my heart now
and forever

  meurdoc kissed the letter passionate-
ly sighed in a despondent feeling of
empty abandon then forced himself to
realize that if the world had so sudden-
ly opened wide for her she had done
right to go and make sure of its bene-
fits this was her due only a selfish
clod could object and yet it hurt for
she had loomed large in his dreams of
the immediate future but after all
two months-pouf

  he rushed on to st malo rushed into
the work before him plunged at it with
a feverish intensity he labored day
and night like a madman getting his
plates of iron shaped getting them in
place two months within this time
he must achieve triumph ere she came to
st malo

  letters came not frequent but re-
assuring dazzling incredible she had
been presented at court she had met
the emperor himself he had even spo-
ken of meurdoc in whom he had great
hopes to her it was wonderful mar-
velous 

meurdoc stole precious time to
write long replies and so back to
his labor three weeks a month six
weeks drove past and the cuirass of iron
was creeping over the old frigate he
wrote the emperor all would be in
readiness whenever the test could be
made he wrote gloria she must be
present must be sure to witness his tri-
umph  and on the heels of this marriage
there would be no hindrance now tri-
umph was inevitable and would mean
success fame wealth

  oh he was living in an iridescent
bubble of dream these days yet getting
things done proving point by point all
he had thought out in theory but no


the blue book magazine

answer came to his last letters the
emperor made no reply gloria made
no reply

  then one day when meurdoc was
hard at work in the bay where the old
frigate was moored a very elegant gen-
tleman was brought out by a boatman
a man of forty or so his features lined
with dissipation and high living yet
emanating a certain authority a master-
ful charm meurdoc wiping the sweat
out of his eyes faced him angrily

  your business monsieur by what
right are you here

  the other smiled and beckoned him
aside where none could hear 

  i am sent to discuss arrangements
with you my card monsieur

meurdoc glanced at the pasteboard
with a shock this was the count
de morny-half-brother of the emperor 
your pardon m le comte-

  say no more i beg your attitude
was entirely correct his majesty ap-
proves all you have done four days
from now the test is to be made can
you be ready

  meurdocs face lit up ah i could
be ready in four hours four days is
ample the emperor is coming here
he is not morny said dryly they
went down to the cabin of the old frig-
ate and there talked in private the
financier and politician spoke without
reserve

  his majesty goes to brest incognito
two steam frigates are waiting there
they will be off st malo the fourth day
from now his presence will not be
known or suspected every precaution
will be taken can this ironclad ship
sail

  with a crew yes

  i have authority she will sail out
on the fourth day meet the two frigates
and proceed with them up the bay to-
ward granville not too close to mont
st michel because of the shallows it
is a lonely empty place this bay
this ship will be there abandoned
and the two frigates will open fire at
close range so that the effect of the shot
can be observed bad weather may
cause a change of plan but nothing else
we cannot go to sea for the test there
are a number of ladies in the party and
we desire all to be kept in calm water
and the crew

  there are several ships in harbor
here ill send men aboard with officers
who can be trusted

  so it was arranged sheathed now in
an iron cuirass only her deck left un-
protected the glorieux was made ready
for her last ride for win or lose she
was condemned

  summer breezes fair smooth sea day
after day but gloria came not nor any
word frowi her so that meurdoc firmly
put her out of his thoughts until this
matter should be ended and the fourth
day dawned fair and bright with gentle
winds offshore

  with mid-morning the frigate drew
out of the old port passed the frowning
cannon and the city and swept into the
bay- morny stood with pierre meur-
doc on her deck and the officers won-
dered that she sailed as well as ever
the iron sheathing made little or no dif-
ference in her handling

  over the horizon grew the billowy
plumes of smoke-the two promised
frigates coasting up from brest the
glorieux stood out to meet them sig-
nals were made and exchanged on the
quarterdeck of one frigate fluttered gay
bits of color the emperor would be
there morny said dryly where the la-
dies were

  all three ships hove to a boat came
dancing over the water the captain of
the glorieux descended into her to get
his instructions about the test morny
and pierre meurdoc accompanied him

  on the frigates deck now a smallish
imperial figure without uniform meeting
them greeting morny with great affabil-
ity casting an eye of query and a smile
on the waiting meurdoc then the lat-
ter was speaking with napoleon while
instructions were being arranged among
the officers-speaking with him until
looking past to the quarterdeck meur-
doc saw a figure there at the rail

  a figure a face and with wild boy-
ish impulse he turned from the em-
peror and went dashing aft a name on
his lips

  gloria

it was she indeed laughing radiant un-
utterably beautiful a lady now gay-
ly dressed glinting with jewels meurdoc
stood face to face for a moment staring

  almost i failed to recognize you he
cried joyfully so this is why you
didnt write me it was to be a surprise
eh

  he held out his arms but she cast a
glance at the amused ladies and gentle-
men around and shook her head

  not now not now pierre here-i


the emperor	

had a letter ready tc send you take
it and think as well of me as you can
my dear i am so sorry 

  she took a letter from her bodice
thrust it into his hand and rejoined the
others but meurdoc staring after her
was as though turned to ice then
slowly he left the quarterdeck the
eyes of the emperor were upon him cold
and chilling eyes but he paid no heed
to anything the letter was in his pock-
et he dared not open it he was afraid
to touch it he was lost to all around
for in the girls eyes he had read what
turned all his triumph to ashes

  and the letter he knew well would
confirm the blow to read it he must
be alone

 seeing nothing aware of nothing
around him he descended into the small
boat the captain followed him spoke
to him but he returned no answer and
the other shrugged they regained the
glorieux and now the three frigates
headed up the bay a few miles with the
land a blue edge to the dancing glitter-
ing water and a distant dot that was
the shining spire of mont st michels
masonry

 back on the quarterdeck where the
ladies laughed and jested the emperor
spoke with gloria de brion spoke apart
and low-voiced she shrugged lightly
 why not he had to know this
was the best time perhaps hell have
other things to busy himself about
no

  napoleon smiled pinched her cheek
met her wide blue eyes for a moment
then turned to join the naval officers at
the rail the glorieux had drawn far
ahead of them and now lay hove to her
canvas brailed boats under her rail tak-
ing off her crew

through a glass the emperor in-
spected those men those boats the
emptying deck as the two frigates luffed
and the whistles blew and ports fell open
and the guns were shotted and made
ready boats left the side of the target
all were well away except one which re-
mained at her ladder the emperor
laid aside his glass

  the signals

 when they wave a flag we fire a
blank gun at that signal they must
leave and we open fire

  the emperor lifted his glass again
his face was chill and cold

  there is the signal captain fire
the gun

the president who became emperor

  but sire one boat remains-

   fire the gun

  an order barked was passed forward
a lower-deck gun roared with a smear
of smoke dissolved on the wind the
one boat remaining by the target hastily
decamped her men pulling hard the
officers around glanced one at another
then at napoleon he spoke quietly

  open fire captain

   a bugle leaped out silvern on the sun-
light the blast reechoed from the
other frigate then the deck shivered
and shook with thunder the ship heeled
to the recoil the ladies cried out in ter-
ror bursts of white smoke filled the air

  back and forth the two frigates
steamed broadside upon broadside
roared and rocked the daylight from
the target so close that details could be
clearly discerned echoed a yammering
clang as the solid shot banged against
her iron cuirass her small boats cir-
cling widely to be out of danger waited
to be picked up

  the masts of the target were shat-
tered shot plowed her decks smashed
everything to kindling aboard her that
could be reached but from the watch-
ing officers came mutters of amazement
the hull itself was unhurt few shot
perhaps none seemed to penetrate that
iron cuirass or even to dent it apprecia-
bly

  then the roaring thunder of gunfire
died out the bugles and the whistles
shrilled the two frigates lost way boats
were put out for inspection of the tar-
get but ere they filled with men one
of the boats from the target came dash-
ing frantically in under the counter and
the captain of the glorieux shouted up
at those above
the emperor

  why dont you answer our signals
weve been trying to make you see them
we did not wave any flag m meurdoc
is still aboard that hell-we had to
leave him he had shut himself into
the cabin-why nobody knows he re-
fused to come out-

  the frigates captain looked at the
emperor met those cold chilling steady
eyes and read their message aright-
with a mental salute

 you mistake he shouted down
we distinctly saw your flag waving
this mental acuity on his part made
him very shortly a rear admiral

  now boats pulled hard for the shot-
rocked target raced for her men bend-
ing to the oars with a will under all
that cannonade she had scarcely suffered
damage only in one place at the very
stern where the plates of iron had been
badly adjusted had the shot done any
damage

  an entire broadside had smashed into
her there wrecking everything in the
stern cabins turning it into a chaos of
splintered ruin and amid this ruin
they found the wreckage of a man with
a torn scrap of paper clenched on one
hand

so the story ended mont st michel
and the gleaming bay died away i
was back in the collectors club again
looking at my friend etienne de molnay
the envelope still in his hand

  in  during the crimean war
he went on slowly three french ar-
mored ships engaged the kinburn forts
and proved their worth that was the
first use of the ironclad in war thus you
see my argument was proven pierre
meurdoc changed the course of all his-
tory

 but what of the man himself and
of the girl gloria i asked interested
in the human factors in this drama

 he smiled wryly my grandfather
icked up what was left of him it had
onorable burial as to la glorieux-
why worry he shrugged lightly
her own dream came true her own
horizon opened to her and if napoleon
the little had anything on his con-
science he certainly never spoke of it in
later days nor did his mistress nor
did his empress

  which i thought closed the matter
very fittingly

the next tory in this great series takes
us back to america and the introduction
of the revolver

t ank parley sat on his piazza watching
the stars brooding thinking if
j-j moloch had only lived

   the afterglow still shone on the snowy
san gabriels more radiant than the
rising stars which seemedwan and ex-
hausted from climbing over such high
mountains it was going to be cold
enough to hurt the new bloom but lank
parley did not care his grove was
worthless for since molochs death he
had neglected it let it run to seed he
sat here surveying the ruins the oranges
scarred by katydids puffy from frost
strewn on the ground by the winds

  if moloch had lived id have tried
one more year to make the grove pay
that was what lank told everybody-
including himself

   a girl drove a buckboard up the road
she stopped at his driveway and got out
as her face came into the lamplight of
the ranch-house door lanks heart leaped
he was astonished not because she came
here alone but because of her lithe wiry
body and the burned beauty of her face
worshiping her from afar and for many
years lank was always astounded that
such a girl should exist

  lank got to his gangling feet and
stepped down from the piazza covering
all three steps at once

  i was just thinking about you hal-
lie-miss trilles he had really been
thinking of moloch but he said when-
ever i think of my horse i say to my-
self  hallie trilles lost her mare-a
good mare almost as good as moloch
we have something in common we
ought to console each other

   mr parley the girl broke in calmly
is this yours she held out a span-
ish rowel of beaten silver
a specially attractive story by a
new writer who knows a lot
about horses-and people

by

   kenneth
   perkins

  he examined it and chuckled yes
its mine what luck i dont mean
getting it back i mean losing it so you
could find it and then ride ten miles

tust to bring it to me sit down and
 boil some coffee

  youre sure its yours

  lank sensed by this insistent way of
hers that the visit might not be entirely
romantic his voice changed slightly
unconsciously whats it matter any-
way yes im sure-i know its mine
because i tried to get a mex silversmith
to fix this point thats busted off

  he was going to add that if she wanted
it and thought it was such an important
ihing she could keep it-hed give it to
her but he saw a very queer flash in
her eyes she looked at him up and
down steadied her look on his face

  he wished suddenly that he had raked
up the bark and palm-branches even
though he was not working the ranch
he was living here

  and now he heard her saying youve
sunk rather low parley

  he stiffened but then realized she was
saying what everybody said molochs
death had taken the heart out of him
he had tried the solace of red-eye he
had loafed and brooded

 after a painful pause he answered
her youre the first one that seems to
be worried about me when moloch
was winning those trotting races ai san
berdoo i had lots of friends theyd
lend me money for fertilizer and water-
assessments knowing moloch could nev-
er lose it takes money to grow oranges
and that horse supplied it even the
bank stopped lending when he got out
of his barn and busted his neck in that
cistern yonder

    i can understand your getting in the
  dumps and taking to gambling and loaf-
  ing the girl said almost sympatheti-
  cally you parleys were all gamblers
  same as my menfolks but she added
  in a level voice i cant believe youd
  take to horse-stealing

  she could not see the effect of this on
  his face for the light from the door
  was behind him but she heard the slight
  gasp she knew that if she had been a
  man he would have knocked her down

    she summoned all her courage that
  rowel of yours was found in our corral
  the night my mare was stolen

    the silence made her heart thump
  it seemed a deliberate measure of time
  on his part eloquent of his anger as well
  as his helplessness it was as if she had
  struck him when his hands were tied

    he made a cigarette slowly licked it
  shut and said i guess its not my
  rowel after all i never went near your
  ranch and never will either

    hallie went on steadily none of us
  ever dreamed the rowel could be yours
  thats why so many months have
  passed but today something happened
  which gave us a pretty good hunch-
  reckon we better say good night
  lank interrupted if i wanted to be a
  horse-thief id pick out something bet-
  ter than that mare of yours i saw her
  in her best race she only did the last
  quarter in thirty

    twenty-nine the girl corrected
automatically and then checked herself
mr parley do you mind telling me

	the blue book magazine

something where does your mozo dis-
appear for weeks at a time which i hear
hes been doing the last year

  who old soggy i cant pay his
wages any more so hes taken to pros-
pecting up in the calico hills comes
home once in a while when hes dry
and wants a spree-

  he checked himself for the girls
question struck him as being very sig-
nificant he remembered vaguely that
his old mozo had asked him for those
sacks of corn that were left over in mo-
lochs stall another time he wanted
some sulphate of iron for a new-fangled
gold-assay lank also remembered that
soggy had always fancied that pair of
spanish rowels

  whats old soggy got to do with this
game youre rolling he asked the girl

  he was seen heading down here to-
day after sundown and he was leading
a stove-up bay mare that looked as if
shed cracked her hoofs wintering in the
mountains she saw that lank was
holding the smoke in his mouth not
breathing i came here for one thing
tonight parley i want my mare

  going to just stand here till you get
her

  thats what im doing

  whatll your uncle think of that
hes up the street at the comas
grove waiting for me to get through
talking to you

  i vish hed come with you-and
called me what you called me lank
said significantly

  i expected youd figure thats the best
way out-to talk smoky

  oh no if i was a rustler i wouldnt
fight id run

  then youd be making a mistake
itll interest you to know that jed mur-
charee and some of his deputies are
cooling their saddles down at the lemon
grove on the south

  well of all the little hellcats lank
exploded you mean youve surrounded
my ranch

  i want my mare

  lank swallowed then grinned a girl
can get away with this-calling me a
rustler i mean a hunky little girl like
you i wont even get mad its fun
seeing your eyes blaze but when you

 call jed murcharee and a bunch of
 shotgun deputies into this game-
 dont think im that much of a short-
 horn parley he was coming to arrest
 you and i told him to lay off till i talked
 to you

   thanks lank grunted

   i told them all that if youd stolen
 queen high-which i wouldnt believe
 -that youd give her back to me and
 thats what im here for

   thanks again want to search the
 grove

   she did not seem to get the joke in-
 stead she faced him yes
new bloom



  all right damn it come on

  he stalked across the palm-branches
and mildewed oranges got a lantern at
the oil-shed then stepped into the rich
green gloom of the grove

  she followed realizing slowly that she
had come merely to prove to murcharee
that the rumors about lank parley were
unfounded and lank sensed this hoped
it was true she had not come to insult
him her visit was a good deed she
was actually bucking some men who
wanted to lynch him the whole valley
had been in a furor when hallie trilles
mare was stolen and even lank parley
himself had sworn that the thief would
get what any rustler got in the old days
everyone knew hallie and liked her
her family like the parleys had come
over the old mormon trail to settle the
san bernardino valley they had raised
stock before they turned the sage plains
into orange groves    lank saw it all
clearly now hallie was on his side

  from the central point of the grove-
which was a tree with its thermometer
and electric alarm to warn of a freeze-
the rows of trees gave the optical il-
lusion of radiating in every direction
such was the pattern of their planting
from here the entire ranch was visible
how could a mare be hidden here

at the end of one vista a barn tipped
 crazily because of the winters flood
which had undermined it another vista
ended at the chicken-coops in the lee of
the windbreak a shed for firewood
smudge-oil spraying  cans clippers
pickers bags leaned against the main
house in the lucid darkness above a
tank-house the windmill instead of
creaking in movement sang with taut
wings and wire lank used to hide his
liquor in the shed beneath so that
soggy would not find it if soggy had
come to the ranch today according to
the rumor he might have stopped to
hunt for a jug of red-eye the possi-
bility occurred to lank because he heard
a noise in the tank-house as he led the
girl past it he halted turned

  it was not however a noise made by
a man but by a horse why -a horse
should wander into a place like this
lank could not imagine it was a damp
cold hovel filled with sacks that had once
held guano and loam and marl the
floor was mucky from the last flood

  as the girl waded behind him in the
cover crop lank pulled open the jammed
door heard a whinny

 yes it was a horse-a bay mare
gaunted lop-eared weary-and in foal

  hallie trilles came to the door gasped
-and the gasp turned to a low heart-
rending moan she staggered in and
threw her arms about the mares droop-
ing neck the pudgy thorn-bitten nose
puffed gave a snort smelled the gentle
brown hand and nickered queen high
for that single moment of abeyance in
the tribulation of life was content   

  as lank looked on at this reunion he
observed that despite the scars of a long
trail the mare had not been starved but
judiciously fed even groomed and other-
wise cared for an army blanket was
tied about her middle with yucca fiber
some old bits of leather were sewn about
her pasterns to keep them from interfer-
ing and her hoofs showed the soothing

as the girls face came into i lie
lampliulil of the ranch-house
door lank parleys heart leaped


the blue book magazine

touch of pine tar and mutton tallow
some one had been concerned about her

  hallie lifted her head and the mare
wheezed an enormous lugubrious sigh a
sort of horse-laugh as if telling her loved
mistress to look at the funny side of this
enormity that had been played upon her
this outrage this joke

  hallie burst into convulsive sobs her
cheek against the mares cheek her arms
hugging her then abruptly she whirled
and faced lank she turned into a fury
her eyes cold as ice burst into hot flame

  so you are a horse-thief and i
didnt believe it you not only rustled
a thoroughbred but shes in foal and by
what sort of a horse some runt cayuse
in the desert where you hid her and
turned her loose lynchings too good
for you 

  lank was mumbling helplessly it
must have been that damned little sheep-
tick soggy-

  oh yes sure youll say it was your
mozo well maybe jed murcharee will
believe a gauzy yarn like that when i
call him she led the mare out and
besides murcharee theres eight or ten
more wholl talk to you she held the
branches so the mare would follow her
without being scratched and she
called back in conclusion i hope you get
shot i

  the mare followed her head resting
wearily on the arm that hugged it but
then apparently for no reason the girl
hesitated and stared into the cover crop
lank lifted his lantern

  a gnarled runt with a leather face and
hairy ears was blocking the girls path
this was soggy bumptious as a chapar-
ral cock grinning weakly smelling of
red-eye horse-liniment and mexican ta-
males

  you aint calling murcharee yet
please maam

  soggy  lank exclaimed you dod-
dering old sheep-biting crook

  get out of my way the girl said

  wait a minute please both of you
listen soggys grin showed a mouthful
of horselike teeth lank here didnt
do it i done it

  lank stepped up and clutched him be-
hind his wrinkled neck so the girl was
right some one in the parley outfit stole
her horse 

  now lank wait i treated the mare
right i corned her plenty like you al-
ways do a foaling mare i gave her iron
sulphate i kept her thin because fat
would give fever at foaling-time and-
and youre going to be lynched
hallie interrupted in a rage

  which is what id like to do to you
right now  lank agreed

soggy struggled loose and faced the
girl

  oh now youre talking of lynching
are you well why dont you go nearer
home maybe you remember how lanks
trotter got out of his barn last april
were talking about my horse not
yours hallie snapped

  ill tell you about yours in a minute
so listen i found moloch dead that
morning i had a hang-over i dassent
tell lank my bunk was in the leanto
next to molochs stall and i should of
heard him led out i thought it was my
fault getting tanked up me and lank
go on a two-weeks bust-were so broken
up when the haze clears i figure slow
and certain it was your hostler pablo who
got me tanked up on purpose

  what for lank objected

  because it always burned him up the
way moloch beat every horse he ever
trained for the trilles

  the girl nodded slowly go on what
else 

  i went over to your outfit to see pablo
and found hed gone to mexico i knew
then hed got scairt because moloch
broke away from him and was killed
you didnt tell me this lank said
hotly

  there wasnt any proof and we
couldnt lynch pablo anyway after hed
lined out i waited five-six weeks for
him to come back and when he didnt i
was sure what could i do  moloch was
dead i wanted another trotter for lank
i figured the trilles owed us one i took
queen high to the mountains to mate her
to the first good stallion i could top off
well of all the crawling thieving
coyotes lank shouted you steal the
trilles best mare just because you get a
fool hunch-
new bloom	

  its not a fool hunch hallie trilles
announced suddenly calm they stared
at her i remember clearly pablo left
the very morning after moloch died he
woke me up and asked for his pay said
hed got a telegram from his brother
who was in jail and needed money i
remember his bunk hadnt been slept in
that night i found out hed got no tele-
gram and from that day i never heard
of him again i wonder she said as if
to herself can it be possible my own
hostler caused molochs death

  what happened to your mare was
worse than death lank said -and
when shes in foal of all places to hide
her soggy brings her to my ranch
where else could i hide her soggy
pleaded everyone in the valley knows
that horse i had to bring her down out
of the snow think id raise a foal where
the cold would stunt it and swell its knees
and hocks oh no i was taking her
to the imperial valley and had to give
her a couple days rest on the way

  of all the slippery seventeen-button
rattlers lank exploded hallie said
nothing but the mare gave another
snort and nudged the girls shoulder

  soggy noticed the interruption and
stared hard lank followed his eyes
they saw that the weary horse was look-
ing back to the tank-house cold as she
was she had fretted herself into a lather
pawing and hoofing at the ground her
flop-eared dejection could no longer hide
the power that possessed her the ram-
pant urge within the hidden and miracu-
lous life beyond her own life

  look at the way shes acting  soggy
burst out look at how nervous she is
shes looking back to where i had her
shes looking for a place right now
lank i knew it was coming

lank looked puzzled youre crazy
a it was last june she was rustled
thats not even ten months

  well then shes going to slip the foal
on account of the way were all shouting
and scrapping soggy said

  the girl was clinging to the mares neck
as the latter swung around

  she wants the bunk-hous lank
said let her in  let her in soggy
you go get some blankets

  look here the girl objected i
dont want her foaling in any old hole
like this

  its the mares idea not ours lank
said kicking off the top of the nearest
smudge-pot well dry the place out

  the mare tossed her head even though
her mistress was still clinging to her
she got free and shambled wearily into
the shed as soggy came with tattered
blankets and an armful of old smudge-
blackened work clothes lank spread
these over the wet sacks and stepped
out there was more pawing then a
ponderous heaving of the mares body
she went down heavily slowly like a
foundering ship

  lsnk lifted a big smudge-pot in his
arms

  the smoke will choke her if you light
that the girl exclaimed helplessly

  stay out of this weve got to warm
some blankets he lighted the distillate
after setting the pot just outside the door
where the wind sliced the thick black
smoke and tossed it into the grove like a
knife cutting cheese he lighted another
pot and the two gave a touch of warmth
in the biting gale it was not enough

soggy go back to the house and get
that oil-stove and look here you
lank turned to the girl get away from
that door and give the old mare a chance
i wont get away

  all right dont do anything just let
the baby freeze hes your foal not
mine

  what can i do

  go get some big rocks and well heat
em we dont keep hot-water bottles
on this outfit

  hallie ran down to the sand wash of the
last flood and came back with a rock un-
der each arm lank heaped up wind-
break bark and started a blaze he took
the rocks from the girl put them in the
fire ordered more

  soggy trundled out of the ranch-house
grunting and lugging the oil-stove like
an ant with a rose beetle

  while youre resting go back and get
some turpentine and soap liniment


the blue book magazine

i thought you must be in trouble
hallie you been so long

lank said to him well need it for the
little horse when he comes and youll
find some rum on the kitchen shelf no
let the girl get that get going both of
you and make some gruel with a feed
of oats and warm water thats what
shell need for her first meal

  they both obeyed and when the girl
came back lank said more clothes to
wrap around these rocks-woolen shirts
my fur chaps anything you find hes
going to be a premature foal-if he lives
you mean-you think he wont live
hallie asked fearfully

  what do you expect of a mare with the
way youve been screaming around
therell be more screaming when jed
murcharee gets here with a rope

  are you calling murcharee or getting
more clothes

  she did neither for at that moment a
sound came from the tank-house a nicker
and then a commotion as the mare swung
her loose-jointed frame to one side to get
momentum before struggling to her feet
lank dashed in and hallie followed

  they dropped to their knees beside a
wet bundle of fur and bones cuddled in
a nest of blankets

  shapeless as he was he had a strangely
human look to his bewildered eyes like
the look of the first human being breathed
on by god

  ill be damned if the thing isnt
alive lank exclaimed

  you funny little darling hallie
laughed or perhaps she was crying

  hope hes not a mule lank said anx-
iously soggy might have made a mis-
take what if the sire was a mountain
burro 

   hes a beauty hallie protested
 which was stretching a point its

 ueen highs first foal and a winner
 here was a certain amount of doubt in
 her flattery the fur was darker than it
 would be when dry so that the color was
 a mystery in fact all points of con-
 formation were a matter of conjecture
 and extrelrie optimism the girls face
 clouded then puckered her eyelids
 throbbed beat back a tear or two gave
 up welled poor little cayuse she
 wept

   lank was drying the shapeless thing
  with a pair of ragged overalls the mare
 stretched her scrawny neck and helped
 and it was at that moment that they
 heard a footstep in the dry alfalfa out-
 side

   it was too heavy and too deliberate to
 be mistaken for soggys soggy would
 be running from the ranch-house and
 back with towels and bottles or the first
 meal of gruel for the mother mare but
 this footstep paused creaking on bark
 the walker wheezed asthmatically lank
 jumped up

   when he stepped out he faced jed
 murcharee

 jed was a mountainous man his stom-
 ach sustained by a belt so that the
 upper half rolled up in a big fold en-
 croaching upon his chest and its star
 hi lank

   whats the trouble jed

   thats what im asking you i was
 up to the lemon grove with some of the
 boys and i saw this here fire thought
 id mosey over and say hello

   yes-i was just starting to smudge
 lank explained this cold might hurt
 the new bloom

   with this norther blowing

   if it veered to the west wed have
 enough of a freeze to spoil my crop
 your what murcharee grinned at
 his little joke his big boneless nose wig-
 gling

 with the spring sap flowing a freeze
 will hurt the trees if not the fruit you
 know how it is the greener they are the
 quicker they freeze as we growers say
 but whats the bonfire for

   same thing im kind of short on
 distillate have to burn anything i got
 crank-case oil crude oil even brush i
 was just going to change to my smudge-
 clothes he showed the overalls in his
 hands which were obviously suited for
 smudging and little else

   hm pretty funny
new bloom



  the girl slipped out of the door and
closed it behind her

  whats funny jed

  i thought you must be in trouble
hallie you been so long and when i
saw these pots burning it looked to me
like youd finished your palaver with
lank here and forgot all about us

  i thought you agreed to stay out of
this game till td talked with lank

the beefy and monumental murcha-
ree looked hurt still talking
no hallie said quietly lank had
nothing to do with what happened to
queen high the rowel wasnt his
then how about his mozo leading your
mare down through the cajon

  it wasnt his mozo hes got an alibi
which i happen to know is the truth
jed murcharee rasped a thumb over
his triple chin - well im sure glad to
hear that he squinted at the smudge-
pots then at the wind in the sky all
i can say is what i said in the first place
that lank parleys the best horse-breeder
in the county but not a horse-thief
as he spoke his blue-veined nose was
sniffing he had a good nose as every-
one in the valley knew he could scent a
fugitive by the risen dust of his horse
he was a regular bloodhound when it
came to scenting horses in the conglom-
erate fragrance of crushed alfalfa guano
waxy white orange blossoms and smudge-
smoke there was nothing that should not
have been there except the unmistakable
smell of a barn but there was no barn
anywhere around this part of the grove
jed murcharee decided that he must be
mistaken

  and if thats all you want jed lank
said kicking the lid off another smudge-
pot why ill get on with my work
murcharee waddled off casting a final
glance at the girl his eyes screwed to two
tiny troubled slits then suddenly a grin
twisted one side of his mouth from the
look of hallies moist hot eyes jed mur-
charee arrived at a conclusion it did
not explain the smudging when the north-
er was keeping the temperature safe but
it made one point very clear hallie
trilles needed no help from him nor
did she want him on this ranch he left

  lank looked down into the girls face
in amazement-that same amazement
which she always stirred in him

  so you wanted heat for the new
bloom she said smiling thatd be a
good name for the little critter ill call
him new bloom

       

   but whyd you send jed away

   i saw danger on your face i knew if

 i	turned soggy over to him youd start
 smoking things up

   i guess youre right i wouldnt let
 any harm come to that little terrapin
 even if he does belong in jail he did
 what he did sos to help me he couldnt
 stand the way i was brooding over mo-
 loch and letting the ranch go to pot the
 old seedwart was pretty fond of us-


the blue book magazine

a

wliere else could i hide her

of my dad and then of me course he
ought to be hanged

  i want to talk to him

  lank gave a few whistles the sort a
man will use in calling his dog soggys
head and ears appeared cautiously over
the high cover crop

  come here you penny-ante lizard
  soggy came

  the girl looked down at his pouchy
face

  i want to ask you something soggy
considering the way you look at things
do you have any remote hunch that you
were doing something crooked when you
stole queen high

  no maam no remote hunch whatso-
ever

  the girl put up her hand to stop lanks
imminent interruption

  you still think that the trilles out-
fit owes your outfit a horse 

  course i do i got more proof about
your hostler pablo-

  never mind well admit that pablo
stole moloch and that the horse got away
from him and wandered back home and
was killed but i want to be sure of
something else if you had the horse we
owe yoy do you think lank could get on
his feet again 

soggy cracked his knuckles in the la-
bor of thought well i know this
much if folks heard lank and me were
raising another race-horse why there
wouldnt be much trouble borrowing
money everybody knows when it comes
to horse-training were pretty hunk and

in a year or two the grove will be paying
provided we fertilize heavy and lank
works day and night pruning and spray-
ing and cultivating

  im asking you one thing else the
girl said what sort of a horse sired
that little fellow in there

  you iriean youre going to give him
to us 

  who sired him

  soggys leathery face shone as if it had
been scrubbed with saddle soap his eyes
darted from the girl to lank he panted
grinned then suddenly looked tragic

  well youll sure crawl my hump if

i	tell you maam but it wasnt my
fault she got out of the brush corral i
made for her and the next i knew she
was running with a wild remuda the
stallion leading the bunch was a scarred-
up piebald crowbait-a hellion of a
fighter but why of all the broncs in the
sierras queen high should pick him out

i	dont know it was a joke on me and
on her too he was awful a lop-eared
roman-nosed flat-footed critter that i
wouldnt hardly call a horse

lank swore the girl seemed to be on

	the point of bursting into tears or
wringing soggys dark brown neck but
she did neither she clenched her fists
pressing her nails into her palms in an
attempt to calm herself then she turned
to lank and said steadily

the foal wont do our stables any
good raising a half-breed fuzztail cant
help queen highs name as a brood mare
but it might help you the foals yours
i dont want him 

  its pretty poor payment i admit
giving you a low-bred cayuse to square
up losing a horse like moloch but you
could bull your luck with him you
could bluff about his blood

  just what i say soggy cried eager-
ly a colt gets his best points from the
dam anyway and we wont tell who the
sire is no onell see he aint a thorough-
bred for a long time besides as the
old-timers say a trotter aint a separate
race or breed folks will just hear that
lank parleys training a new horse which
is going to win every purse ever hung up
at san berdoo

  i wont accept him lank repeated
of course youll have to leave the
mare here till hes weaned soggy hur-
ried on well start him on bruised oats
next month but you better leave her
till his teeth are strong enough to crop
clover
new bloom



  i reckoned on that when i made the
offer but ill be over every day to see
that youre treating her right hallie
stipulated

  lank looked at her quickly what was
this that was being said  hallie trilles
coming over to his grove every day by
grab thats something 

  soggy hopped and danced over the
clods rubbing his horny hands chuckling
hes ourn hes burn may be only a
fuzztail but hes half good anyway
lank and mell do the rest well make
a trotter out of him he ducked into
the tank-house and came out breathless
and triumphant he was carrying a
square of paper in his hand-a check-
up card for the irrigation furrows he
saw lank and the girl standing close to-
gether staring at each other silently
soggy cleared his throat

  please maam- could i ask you just
one little favor if youd give us a bill-
of-sale so if murcharee finds me with this
foal he wont be askin questions about
vents and wartles and brands id like
to have something to show him so he
wont get irritated

  lank muttered get the hell-and-
gone out of here soggy 

  but the girl laughed took the pencil
tied to the check-up card and wrote

  for a good consideration i hereby give
  queen highs first joal to lank parley

  soggy clutched it eagerly for lank
ignoring this nonsense had stepped into
the tank-house

  for the first time lank parley was
making a careful appraisal of the gift-
horse if not in the mouth at least in all
points of conformation the little fel-
low was dry enough now what with the
ministrations of the mare so that his
color was distinguishable and he was al-
ready untangling his wobbly legs trying
to reach for milk

  pretty hefty little critter for a pre-
mature foal lank said proudly born
much too soon but hes standing up al-
ready  too bad you havent got a father
little feller lank looked up to the girl
behind him if hed only had molochs
deep thighs and sloping hips 

  combined with the dams lean hocks
and knee action  hallie said woefully

 and molochs cannon bone the
strength of it which your mare hasnt
got

  hell have her high withers hallie
pointed out in defense of her pet

  sure its the two of them that would
make him perfect molochs length from
hip joint to hock which a champion trot-
ter needs-

  and my mares high head hallie
insisted as the last word

  lank held the little cayuse on his
ridiculous legs so that he could suckle
the girl rubbed the incredibly soft ears

  pablo was always telling me hallie
said tragically that moloch and my
mare would have given us a world-
beater

  hes not going to be a piebald any-
way thank god

  a piebald  soggy said contemptu-
ously they had forgotten he was stand-
ing behind them a piebald what an
idea-wow 

  you said the bronc was a piebald
  what bronc

  consarn you for a lop-eared prune
you said the wild bronc the leader of
the remuda was a piebald

vh him soggy chuckled way down
v in the leathery folds of his neck
he creased the bill-of-sale accurately
tucked it in the pocket of his vest and
sewed a piece of wire through the flap
i was only fooling if i told the real
secret as regards this here colt wed nev-
er have got him for love or money thirty
grand wouldnt buy him forty grand
fifty-

  what secret for petes sake

  why that he belonged to us all along
course no jury of ranchers would give a
verdict against hallie trilles being in all
known cases the foal belongs to the owner
of the mare but not this foal i told
you i wasnt rustling the mare and i
meant it i was just appropriatin the
foal she was carrying-a foal which was
stole from us hefore he was born 

  you mean she was in foal the night
you stole her  lank exclaimed the
truth dawning

  sure i neglected to state that thats
why pablo took moloch out of the barn
you mean this is the son of moloch
lank gasped

  lank hallie cried throwing her
arms about him weve got a world-
beater she blushed and then added
i mean youve got him 

  i like it better what you said the
first time lank answered

  the possessive plural is a small word
but in this case it extended beyond a
complete language

   the captivating story of a tre-
   mendous journey in search of
   the lost riches of angkor   
   by the author of caravan
   t reasure

by james
francis
dwyer

the story thus far

he whole amazing affair began one
fine spring day in paris when we-
my wild irish uncles and i-met
the russian count and heard his extra-
ordinary story for the russian was
looking for two daring and able men to
risk with him a great adventure and in
those two untamed hawks of trouble my
uncles thurland and flane spillane he
knew he had found the right men

   at the paris exposition it seems had
been displayed a reproduction of a part
of the astounding ruins of angkor in the
remote french colony of cambodia and
a part of the exhibit was a native of the
region a priest or bonze who claimed to
be of incredible age and the bonze had
told the russian that the inhabitants of
angkor had fled the plague many cen-
turies ago leaving their great city de-
serted as the french had recently found
it

   the count believed the bonze pos-
sessed the secret of prolonging life in-
definitely-the secret also of the hiding
place of the rich treasures taken from
ancient angkor

   and so it came about that we all
including the counts lovely american
niece joyeuse took ship for far cam-
bodia-and began what was to prove an
adventure terrific indeed the story con-
tinues in detail

the van tromp was no great sea
boat she was small and the medi-
terranean seemed to know it picking on
her whenever a wind came up for the
seas bully the little ships the waves
having a great longing to rock them
backward and forward trying with all
their might to tip them right over and
off malta a big howling wind came rush-
ing out of africa and fell like a mastiff
on the van tromp

   the monk went to his bunk and stayed
 there so did the count and on the
 second day of the storm joyeuse thought
 she could stand it better if she retired
 captain oudegeest and the passenger
 whose name appeared to be schiemann
 and who was so he told thurland a
 latvian by birth ate with us at the big

table in the saloon the dutch steward
served the count joyeuse and the ittonk
in their cabins the count and joyeuse
ate little but the monk ate nothing at all
he lay with shut eyes mumbling what
seemed curses at the tumbling waters

  on the third night of the storm flane
went to the monks cabin before retiring
to see that the old fellow was all right

the deck was unlighted the cabin dark
flane pushed open the door and was in
the act of stepping within when some
one leaving the cabin crashed against
him knocking him flat on his back

the blue book magazine

  flane reaching up made a grab at the
leg of the unknown as the fellow was
leaping over him and the unknown came
with a crash to the boards the noise
brought thurland the count and my-
self some one pushed the button of a
flashlight flane had a clutch on the
ankle of schiemann the yellow-faced
latvian

  captain oudegeest lifted schiemann to
his feet at first we thought he had been
dazed by the fall then we discovered
that he was under the influence of a
drug the captain led him into the
saloon seated him in a chair and sent
for a shadowy officer called the doctor
but who seldom left his cabin

  the doctor made a quick examina-
tion of the yellow-faced man he made
a queer gesture by running his fore-
finger beneath his nose then he winked
at the captain in silence the captain
and the- doctor took hold of the fellow
and escorted him to his cabin

  thurland looked at flane was he
walking out of the monks cabin when
you struck him he asked

  walking snapped flane he was
flying knocked me flat with his speed 

  what the devil was he doing there
growled thurland

  lets go and see said the count

  in a body we went to the cabin of the
ancient he was sound asleep

we returned to the saloon captain
oudegeest was there drinking coffee
the count told him that he considered
the presence of schiemann in the cabin
of the monk rather extraordinary and
he suggested that the captain question
the man in the morning

  i vill do no such ting said the
captain dot oldt man is no goodt if
schiemann went in dere to kill heem i
vould be bleased he is badt he bring
troubles on my boat noisily he sucked
down the remainder of his bowl of coffee
and stalked out

  what does he mean by troubles on his
boat asked the count

  thurland shook his head i dont
think the dutchman likes methuselah
he said he seemed a little angry about
the old fellows story of his great grand-
father and the little brown lady he
might think that theres a brown leaf in
his genealogical tree lets go to bed
well talk matters over when we see the
latvian in the morning

  we didnt see the latvian in the morn-
ing he kept to his cabin we rolled

by crete the van tromp groaning like
an old lady with rheumatism

  the monk was up but he knew noth-
ing about his visitor of the previous eve-
ning he shook his head vigorously
when the count questioned him he
hadnt spoken to schiemann and he had
nothing in his cabin that the other would
desire captain oudegeest was sulky
he barely acknowledged our salutes

it was immediately after lunch that
trouble started a finnish sailor was
the owner of a monkey of the wah-wah
species and today the finn brought him
out on the sunshiny well-deck

  the old monk was squatting outside
his cabin a blanket wrapped around
him his eyes half closed the rolling
of the van tromp was hard on him

  the wah-wah barked just one short
single note and to his great surprise
there came an answering bark and
from the way he swung around on his
hindlegs and stared about the steamer
it seemed that the bark pleased him he
was a male wah-wah and he thought the
invisible barker was a female thats
what his actions told us

  he barked again his head on one side
listening and immediately the answering
bark came to him

  the wah-wah let out a whole stream
of barks and started out to look for the
lady the finn screamed at him but
he took no notice

  a mad ape was that fellow his speed
was amazing he dashed here and there
and everywhere he went through the
sailors quarters theft not finding the
unseen barker he sprang for the upper
deck barking as he searched for the
invisible sweetheart

  he rushed from one cabin to another
clawing at the bunks pulling blankets
and coverlets to the floor upsetting ev-
erything that wasnt nailed down

  it was unlucky that the yellow-faced
schiemann should be asleep when the
wah-wah came searching the half-
crazed ape tore the blankets from the
berth and the barks of the wah-wah
were mixed with the curses and the yells
of rage of the passenger

  a revolver cracked the monkey ap-
peared with schiemann in pajamas at
his heels a second bullet missed the
ape who swung from the iron rail to the
deck below and disappeared in the quar-
ters of the sailors fear for the moment
smothering the desire to find the unseen
barker
the treasure of vanished men	

  the first officer of the van tromp
seized the arm of the latvian and tried
to explain the conduct of the wah-wah-
how the monkey had been upset by the
barking of another monkey hidden some-
where on the steamer

  schiemanns gaze fell on the ancient
wrapped in the blanket folds screaming
threats he broke away from the officer
and made a rush toward the ancient

  it was thurland who halted him my
uncle stepped in his path when schie-
mann was within ten feet of the monk
wrenched the revolver from his hand
tossed it overboard then swung the fel-
low round and gave him a push in the
direction of his cabin

  thurlands action seemed to bring him
to his senses he mumbled an apology
for his conduct then at a trot hurried
back to his cabin the old monk dozed

  the count looked at thurland and
flane the three were puzzled was
it methuselah who barked  asked flane

  of course said thurland i saw
his lips move when the monkey climbed
up the ladder from the deck below
but yellow-face hadnt seen him do
it and yet he knew said flane

  thurland was silent for a long minute
then he spoke that fellow is no more
a latvian than i am he growled hes
a cross-breed from macao where theyve
got so many different kinds of blood in
their bodies that their hands and their
feet fight with each other and the hair
on their heads grows seven different ways
out of spite and it isnt the first time
that hes seen methuselah either

  the count nodded he seemed upset
as the van tromp rolled into more
peaceful waters joyeuse reappeared on
deck she was excited because we were
approaching port said for port said is
the gate to the orient and all the won-
ders of the east somewhere in the blue
haze in front of us was the great canal
that de lesseps dug through the leagues
of sand and our nearness to it played
the mischief with my nerves

  for the east came out to meet us
with every thump of the screw the feel
of it became more apparent there was
a soft velvety wind that came up- from
the desert below cairo the great sudan
part of the sea through which we moved
came from the nile itself the great river
shoving into the mediterranean the mil-
lions of tons of water it brings from the
hills of abyssinia 

  and the stars bigger and brighter than
i had ever seen them seemed to know

 that we were on our way to find the lost
 city of klang-nan of which the monk
 spoke and where he had lived hundreds
 of years before the fine stars that had
 looked down on many wanderers   

   before daylight i awoke to find that
the steamer had stopped i looked out
the port and saw the town of port said
and there on the end of the breakwater
leading to the canal entrance was the
statue of a man with his arm extended-
the great de lesseps pointing toward
the east-the glorious east

chapter ix

a kidnaping at port said

nphis town said my uncle thurland
 is the sink of the world every
man going to the east gets his first
mouthful of the devils juice in port said
and every man going westward takes his
last swig before he reaches countries that
the lord still rules over the hungry
westerner on his first voyage gets pop-
eyed over it and the old rakes from the
east leave it with regret theres a pub
in queenstown called the first and
last and i always think of it when i
see port said

   thurland and i were going ashore to
buy clothes and shoes and topees for we
had left marseilles with little not having
	the blue book magazine

time or inclination to buy with the
police at our heels flane had taken
joyeuse for a look at the town and the
count was left aboard with the monk
the van tromp had to fill her old
stomach with coal before she went into
the canal and when we came down the
gangplank the colliers were around her
also the bumboat men with all sorts of
trash that they wished to sell to the
crew

  about the wickedness of the town i
can say little but the strangeness of it
slammed me hard when we stepped
ashore at the landing-stage for al-
though it is hot and filthy and smelly it
has to a boy the same strong attrac-
tion as the door to his first circus for
port said is a great door to which come
the hurrying ships eager to get through
to the wonders beyond there they were
in the harbor rocking backward and for-
ward with impatience as they waited
their turn to get into the canal a big
p  o steamer for australia a mes-
sagries boat for china and japan an
american liner on a trip around the
world-filled with folk whose pockets
were lined with dollars that they threw
away at every port for things of no
value for as thurland said ports make

people so crazy that they buy things
they would never think of purchasing at
home and there were big tramp ships
and tankers rocking at their buoys their
captains waiting their turn and the
fierce expectancy and nervousness and
bustle and heat put a glamour on the
town a fine glamour that got into the
blood and put magic into the cries of
the men who pushed rugs and beads and
feathers into your face on the shari es-
sultan husein making the street like a
fair-ground with their whining cries and
you werent surprised to see the english
and the americans buying things in a
hurry the yells of the sellers making
them believe that if they didnt buy
quickly they would lose treasures that
they could never see again

  thurland glared at the pack of ped-
dlers and they fell away from us know-
ing that my uncle was a person who had
seen ports before shrewd are these little
lice who live on the foolishness of travel-
ers cunning in their way of summing up
voyagers now and then a man would
rush at thurland then suddenly turn
away as the fierce eyes of my uncle fell
on him turn away like a yapping terrier
before the look of a bulldog   

  we bought white suits and topees and
shoes and underclothing from sleek ser-
vile egyptians cunning greeks and more
cunning syrians and with hatf-naked
boys carrying our purchases we made
our way back to the landing-stage we
thought we had finished with port said
with its humbug and trickery not know-
ing what was awaiting our ears on the
van tromp not knowing at all

the count screamed the news to us as
our boat swung to the gangplank
we caught his words above the noise of
the winches and the rumble of coal the
monk the monk had escaped

  flushed and excited the count stum-
bled down the ladder and shouted de-
tails the old one was not on the steam-
er it had been searched from stem to
stem the bumboat men had been ques-
tioned no one had seen the ancient
for just a minute the count had napped
outside the cabin of methuselah and
when on awaking he had looked into the
cubicle the berth was empty

  my uncle said nothing although he
was mad with temper he ordered a
steward to take the bundles then he
told our boatman to pull him around the
steamer so that he could question the
squatting bumboat men and fierce was
the treasure of vanished men



that same questioning their faces grew
sallow with fear as he put his queries
had they seen an old man come over
the side  it would be better for them to
speak the truth for if they lied they
would never sell another brass trinket to
sailormen softly he made his threat so
softly that the words carried the fear
that comes with the hiss of a snake

an old man had seen-a wrinkled
 patriarch who might have known
de lesseps he had seen something that
might have been a bundle or it might
have been a man lowered over the side
he had turned his head thinking it
might be contraband but now he was
sure it wasnt that for it had moved
and opium by the beard of the prophet
didnt kick in its cloth although it
could bring dreams

  thurland waved his hand to the land-
ing-stage and we went swiftly back to
the shari es-sultan husein and now
the town was an enemy of ours a place
where tricksters who plotted against us
had their hiding-places   

  on that first trip to the town my uncle
had exchanged greetings with a big man
who stood near the landing-stage they
had known each other in shanghai so
thurland told me and now when we re-
turned to search for the monk the man
was still there smoking a cigar and look-
ing leisurely at the milling crowds

  thurland stepped across to him and
spoke are you busy john  he asked

  im not answered the man i have
all the time in the world and a bit left
over

  i knew from his frank cordial manner
that the man was an american and i
knew by the way he listened to thur-
land that the two were brothers under
their skins for his eyes brightened as
thurland told him of the disappearance
of the ancient

  theyve got him in some hole in this
town of the devil snapped thurland
and im going to find him if i comb it
from here to the first sand dune will
you come along

  let her go cried the man called
john and he was so eager that he
hopped on the bare toes of a lascar and
made the fellow bawl with pain

  now the white visitors to port said
stay around the sea-front on the verandas
of the eastern exchange hotel and the
casino palace and their farthest trip in-
land is to the shipping offices or the
banks and good reason they have for

keeping close to the landing-stage at
the back of the town where the waters
of lake manzala slop against the sun-
baked shanties is the dirty native quar-
ter that you reach by the shari el-gami
et-taufiqi and it was to this section that
my uncle and the american and myself
galloped in a horse carriage with a mad
driver who screamed for- the roadway

  it would be better for you to go back
to the ship said thurland to me as we
climbed into the carriage

  please let me come i said and
when the american named john laughed
thurland pushed me into the carriage

  an inquisitive white in that native
quarter out by the shallow lake has a
fine chance of getting a knife between
his ribs there being a number of colored
residents who hate curiosity but my
uncle didnt care about their feelings
he was thinking only of the loss he
would suffer if the monk was taken away
from him as the galloping horse took
us into the filthy quarter where the odors
of dried fish of rancid oil of saffron
and things unnamable came against us
like an army thurland was thinking of
the dark mekong his strong hands
were clenched as if they held the rose-
colored pearls that marco polo spoke of
the great emeralds that kept a girl pure
and the blazing rubies that were thought
to be the eyes of dead snakes for my
uncle had the power of picturing the
things that he sought throwing them up
before his eyes so that they became ter-
ribly and maddeningly real when he
read a story he saw everything as if it
had happened a gift which some people
have and which is called visualizing

otay here said thurland to the

  o	coachman as we reached the shari
kisra dont move from this spot if i
dont come back for hours youll be well
paid

  the search was on-the search for the
old monk the search through that
quarter that might have been a suburb
of hell itself so full of sin and vicious-
ness it seemed on that morning for the
servants of satan ran the little dens into
which we went one after the other the
little dens in which strange sins were
born and bred in the gloom

  thurland and the american marching
like two big grenadiers dived into the
dens without any fear places where
queer drinks were sold to dazed men and
drabs places from which came the reek
of opium so that you knew what was go-
	the blue book magazine

crying tohsuroth tohsroth into the narrow streets went the human flocxl

ing on there when you were yards away
from the door places where lest women
that were hardly women at all cursed
and shrieked when my uncle pulled aside
the blinds of split bamboo and looked
within

  a man threw a bottle at the head of
the american the american dodged
then with a swift punch he knocked the
fellow down i thought that john was
enjoying it there was a broad grin on
his face as the hunt went on but there
was no grin on the face of thurland
the two eyes of him-those eyes that
always looked like two spearmen on a
castle wall-were blazing with temper as
he asked questions stamping into the
dark rooms behind the opium shops and
bringing squeals from the unclean things
that sat in the half darkness

  we came to a lane that had only one
entrance-a lane full of sand and devil-
try so that it had the look of an un-

sprung trap when you looked at it if
you had only the brins of poor willy
hennessy who had no brains at all you
would say to yourself theres some-
thing wrong here the toe of my shoe
is going to touch a rope or a spring that
the devil has stretched in the sand and
ill lose my immortal soul that was
the feeling that came out from it a feel-
ing that made you think there was an
invisible angel at the open end of it
sending out warnings

  but thurland walked boldly into it
john at his heels and with terror chok-
ing me i ran behind them my ears alive
to the whispers that came from the shut-
tered windows-the whispers that rose
like a swarm of bees when we swung in-
to the lane and from a latticed bal-
cony a light-o-love screamed a warning
that brought a slamming of doors

  thurland pushed against the first door
it gave way before him and three men
the treasure of vanished men



pushing through sikhs hindoos malays and now it came close to a riot

ran into a room beyond he caught the
last of the three by the back of the neck
and pulled him into the sunshine then
as he started to question the filthy
wretch he choked back his words and
flung back his head to listen from
above us came the soft strain of music a
thin wavering eerie note that rose and
fell a note that took both thurland
and myself back to the villa mille
fleurs in neuilly on the evening when
the bonze tried to escape

  thurland flung the man from him and
dashed into the house the american
followed a fear paralyzed my limbs a
terrible fear that held me there in the
fierce sunshine

  squeals and curses came from within
the splintery noises made by the crash-
ing of flimsy chairs and tables the thud
of fists then as i stared at the dark
door thurland staggered out with the
old monk in his arms behind him

guarding the retreat was the american
waving the iron leg of a bedstead that
put fear into the skinny devils who ran
like starved wolves after him

  back to the carriage cried thur-
land and at a trot we fled from the
lane through a narrow alley filled with
refuse then into the shari kisra far
off we saw the waiting coachman and
with a shouting mob at our heels we ran
toward him

  the coachman when he saw the mob
thought the business was one that he
would do well to dodge he sprang to
his driving seat when we were close to
him and started to flog his horse but
the american was too quick for him he
rushed to the head of the sleepy animal
and threw it back on its haunches thur-
land tossed the monk into the carriage
tumbled in after him dragging me with
him john hopped up beside the fright-
ened driver grabbed the whip and used


the blue book magazine

it in turn on the horse and the crowd
that had caught up with us the car-
riage lurched forward we swung at a
gallop into the shari el-gami beyond
was the shari de lesseps and the land-
ing-stage

  as thurland carried the old bonze to
a boat he spoke to the big american
would you like a trip he asked

  where to countered the other

  saigon and beyond said thurland

  sure said the man called john

  step aboard said thurland and
that is how john the american whose
full name was john jefferson martin was
enlisted in the great search   

  we received a visit from the police
during the afternoon they had heard
stories which they wished to verify the
count and thurland spoke to them per-
sons whose names we did not know had
kidnaped the old monk my uncle had
rescued him the affair as far as we
were concerned was finished

  but the police wished to see the bonze
they visited his cabin and questioned
him the count acting as interpreter the
ancient nodded his head vigorously to
show that he wished to stay with the
count and the police had to be content

  how old is he asked the sergeant

  i dont know exactly said the count

  theres a mummy in the egyptian
museum at cairo that is a dead ringer
for him said the sergeant they dug
it and a praying baboon in red granite
out of the place where they found old
tut-ankh-amen he stared for a long
while at the monk then he walked out
on deck and spat fiercely into the sun-
shine he makes me feel as cold as a
lizard he growled

flane and joyeuse returned to the
steamer they had lunched at the ca-
sino palace hotel and were surprised to
hear of all the happenings that had taken
place during their absence they were
introduced to john jefferson martin and
informed of his enlistment they seemed
pleased martin had a friendly manner
captain oudegeest protested that there
was no cabin for him but the dutch
agent wished to gather in every piaster
he could and he made the captain shift
his third officer and give the cabin to
martin

  and our dear friend schiemann
asked flane did he have any hand in
the affair of the morning

  he went ashore early and has not
returned said thurland

  i hope he gets lost said flane it
will save one or the other of us from
twisting his neck

chapter xii

the door of the orient

we edged into the canal late that
afternoon and europe was lost to
us for the canal is the door to the
orient and when a vessel creeps slowly
into the hundred-mile gut those who are
upon her enter another world  the world
of the thousand and one nights the
world of magic of witchery of dreams
and ones thoughts change the common-
sense logical part of the mind giving way
to the flighty imaginative part so that
facts are distasteful and the lamp of
aladdin is in ones hand and the slow-
ness with which the steamer moves
makes a spell its speed being held down
to ten kilometers an hour lest the waves
trouble the embankments and that too
adds to the thrill making the passage a
sort of strange ceremony of initiation

  now it was curious the effect of the
canal upon the bonze he was on deck
when we entered the waterway and al-
most immediately we noticed the change
he had been depressed and silent since
the moment thurland had brought him
back to the steamer but now he roused
himself as we moved slowly down the
reat trench he straightened his back
is eyes that were bits of polished jet
glowed with a strange light and he be-
gan to talk in the manner in which he
had told the story of the plague at
angkor-talk with a fierceness and
swiftness that puzzled the count

  although no one but the count under-
stood what he was saying we strained
our ears to listen to him the very pas-
sion that was in his words holding us-
that and the look of amazement on the
face of the count no time had he to
translate what the old fellow was saying
for the words rolled from the thin lips in
a manner that made us think he was re-
citing something that he had learned
years and years before

  it was a sudden move by flane that
interrupted the flow of words we were
standing in a clump above the well-dock
and flane taking his eyes from the face
of the monk saw something that inter-
ested him a sailor had climbed noise-
lessly from below and was clinging by
his finger-tips to the iron railing so that
he could hear what the bonze was sayingj
the treasure of vanished men



  a fine lesson flane taught the fellow
he lifted his shoe and brought it down
on the mans fingers and the yell of
pain and rage that came from him halted
the monk the sailor dropped down on
the covered hatch and ran for the galley
but we had recognized him he was the
sailor with the large lobes to his ears

  flane sprang over the railing and gave
chase but the fellow hid himself and
my uncle had an angry argument with
captain oudegeest over the incident
the captain would not believe that the
man was eavesdropping he asked why
should anyone listen to what the ancient
was saying

  he ees a mad oldt liar he cried
dot stuff he speak about my great
grandfather ees all lies you must not
intervere mit my sailors you beoples
an dot oldt man make troubles on my
ship

  well make more if some folk dont
watch themselves snapped flane

  flane came back to where we were
standing and put a question did any-
one see schiemann he asked has
he come aboard

  no one had seen the supposed latvian
his cabin door was closed and the
dutch steward shook his head when
thurland made careless inquiry schie-
mann had been left behind at port said

  the flurry caused by the sailors at-
tempt to listen to the bonze took our at-
tention for the moment from the old
man but now our curiosity to learn
what he had been saying made us turn
to the count the old man was silent
but that change in his manner noticeable
when we entered the waterway was more
evident than ever there had come to
him a strange majesty a look of power
of importance there came out from
him something that crushed the doubt
one held regarding his great age the
doubt that one made into a barricade
for sanity

now as the van tromp slipped slow-
ly between the sandbanks the sus-
picion that he was lying about his age
fled from us and we believed it was
upon the face of every one of ust quite
visible in the dusk we believed im-
plicitly the dusk creeping over the
arabian sands helped to establish that
belief a thin green-white moon over
egypt assisted the black outline of a
camel and its rider on the bank lent aid
and the warm odors of the night bedded
down the acceptance in our minds

  a half-mile spear of light came out of
the gloom ahead the eye of the hurry-
ing malle des lndes-the indian mail
the eye of england the van tromp
shouldered in to the hitching-posts to
allow the royal mail free passage what
was a small dutch steamer to the mon-
ster that carried princes and mahara-
jahs diplomats and cattle-kings  the
line of faces looked contemptuously upon
us as she thrust by yet we at the mo-
ment would not have changed places
with any group upon the mailboat for
a kind of ecstasy had come to us with
the belief in the monks great age a sort
of beatitude that thrilled us

the voice of the count showed how
the ancients words had affected him
he spoke in a hushed voice as if great
secrets had been given to him secrets
that he was a little afraid to put into
words

  he says whispered the count that
he was through here years and years be-
fore the canal was constructed he
passed over the old caravan road be-
tween es-salihiyeh and el-kantara
that was the old route from syria to
egypt

  after a long silence thurland put a
question and what was taking him to
egypt he asked his voice hoarse and
low

  for a moment or two the count did
not answer possibly he thought the
answer would appear strange to us and
well it might he was with a party that
was carrying gifts to the sultan ali bey
who had conquered syria but was assas-
sinated when he was returning to egypt
his party heard of the killing and re-
turned

  and when was the sultan ali bey
killed asked thurland

  around  answered the count
quietly

  then as we were figuring in silence
the music came to our ears-that thin
flutelike music that we had heard in the
villa mille fleurs at neuilly and which
thurland martin and myself had heard
in the native quarter of port said

  it came from the dark bank of the
canal a thin sweet lariat of sound cir-
cling over us so that at times we thought
we could see it see it in the velvety
darkness a scarlet thread weaving in
circles rising and falling at the will of
the player

  it twisted itself around the monk he
clutched the rail of the steamer and


the blue book magazine

stared shoreward his lean neck thrust
out his wrinkled face alive with interest
he made little moaning noises queer
animal-like noises that might be made
by a chained dog striving to get to some-
thing just beyond its reach there was
about him a longing that made us think
he might leap from the steamer in an
effort to reach the sandy shore thur-
land stepped close to the old man one
hand ready to grasp his clothes if he
made a move to jump overboard

  the music ran with us the bank was
in darkness and we could not see who or
what produced the sounds but as we
were moving at the slow speed of four
miles an hour it was quite easy for the
musician to keep up with us    in the
afternoon small arab children begging
pennies had run with us for a mile or so

  for miles the music ran with us com-
ing plain to us till we reached the balah
lakes and how it clung to the steamer
we never knew but at the lakes the
channel widened and we heard it far
off then lost it completely

  the monk had no intention of going
to bed and not one of us seemed sleepy
we sat there on the deck and watched
the banks slip slowly by the wash of the
steamer running on either side of us
making two white serpents of foam
against the sand and there was some-
thing in the night that had the quality of
hypnotism for of strange places there
are plenty along that waterway and now
and then the count spoke of them in a
low voice the spot where miriam the
sister of moses was smitten with lep-
rosy and the bitter lakes which are
the marah of the bible   

  in the morning we came to suez and
at suez we got a surprise for a small

launch brought out schiemann whom
we had left behind at port said he hav-
ing reached ismailia by a fast motor-
boat and from there having taken the
train which covers in two and a half
hours the distance that takes a steamer
eight hours or more and with schie-
mann- came a friend-a big black-
browed man who looked a killer if ever
a man did and by the way he glared at
my two uncles as he passed to schie-
manns cabin it would look to a fair-
minded observer that he had picked them
out as likely victims

  im afraid said thurland after he
had passed that the black chap has
heard nothing to your credit

  flane grinned it was you he looked
hard at he said well theres nothing
like a sea voyage for making friendships
so ive heard

  youve heard wrong said thurland

chapter xiii

a battle at aden

the van tromp waddled down the
red sea and on the steamer was the
false quiet that comes before a thunder-
storm when clouds are busy packing
themselves together so that they can
make as big a muss as possible not one
of our party spoke to schiemann or to
the black-browed man whose name we
learned was bruden and they gave no
indication that they wished to speak to
us the two ate at a separate table and
spent the day whispering to each other
   it was a strange ships company
captain oudegeest was surly he glared
at the bonze whenever he passed him
on deck but the monk took no notice

  the count told joyeuse and me about
a curious health system that the bonze
practiced and which the count and the
monk discussed every day the name of
it was hatha yoga and it told of the
proper way to breathe the right exer-
cises to take and the proper food one
should eat if one wished to reach a
hundred years or more

  its too much work said joyeuse
laughing and whats the good of liv-
ing if you look like the monk

  you neednt look like him said the
count

  well id sooner look pretty for a lit-
tle while and then die said joyeuse
id hate to be old and ugly

  but think of the wisdom that would
be yours argued the count
the treasure of vanished men



  i dont like wisdom said joyeuse
then in a lower voice she whispered i
like-i like love

  she glanced along the deck to where
flane was leaning over the rail   

 the count knew a lot about the
world and he had gathered much thrill-
ing information about places and when
he told of what he had seen he did it
with little words that had the color of
crushed opals

  in our passing through the red sea
h spoke much to me of the past the fat
past that was filled with big happenings
in that same quarter for the red sea
and the lands about it were the center of
the world in the days of old and the feel
of those things come to folk who travel
there you think of solomon with his
black beard so curly and shiny sitting
on his high throne made of ivory and
yellow gold asking if the queen of
sheba has arrived to eat some sherbet
with him and ordering up a chariot to
take her for a gallop over the hot sands
his big hairy arm around her so that she
cant fall out for solomon as my
uncle thurland said was always a man
in a hurry as far as ladies were con-
cerned and the two of them asking
questions of each other questions that
were so puzzling that no one else could
answer them    oh what a fine brave
world it was in those days

  and i knew why the count was inter-
ested in the monk and the manner in
which the monk had reached such a great
age for the count thought the present
was nothing at all and that like wine
everything else had to be old to be good
we were going to aijgkor so that he
might find the secret of life then after
hundreds of years he could look back in
reality on days like those we were then
living which would have become golden
to him

  it was a great world in the days of
solomon he said

ut isnt it a fine world now i
asked looking at flane and joy-
euse who were sitting together in the
sunshine

  it is hard and commonplace said
the count there is no poetry in it
what do we have in this sea now  hur-
rying mail-boats filled with silly officials
and soldiers round-the-world cruise-
ships with tired folk who cant amuse
themselves at home ugly tankers carry-
ing oil for airplanes to splatter death on
towns but in the past there was ro-

mance he was silent for a moment
then he spoke for the king had at sea
a navy of tharshish with the navy of
hiram once in three years came the
navy of tharshish bringing gold and sil-
ver ivory and apes and peacocks

  i didnt agree with the count but i
didnt tell him that i thought different
of course the words of the book of
kings were nice words but i was sure
that we were on a journey that was near-
ly as good as the journeys made by the
ships of tharshish and i bet that my
uncles thurland and flane thought the
same also john jefferson martin who
had been told about the pirogues that
carried the pearls and emeralds and ru-
bies up the dark mekong martins eyes
bulged when thurland told him about
those pirogues

yellow-faced schiemann and his
friend bruden had nothing to say to
us captain oudegeest was very sulky
and showed his dislike of the monk the
sailor with the big ear-lobes watched us
whenever we were on the deck and in
this air of suppressed hate we rolled
through the straits of bab-el-mandeb
and came to aden

  the count quoted a few lines about
aden as we came close to it i think
they were written by a poet named kip-
ling but im not sure

  old aden like a barrack stove

  that no ones lit for years an years

  i had never seen a barrack stove but
i knew what was meant for aden is
a place where the little devils of loneli-
ness and despair might make their home
hard and heartless is that town on the
bare rocky coast a place where the germs
of war and hate are bred the lord
made it a hatching-ground for both de-
nying it grass and trees and water and
toasting it daily with a sun that dries
the brains of the poor devils that have
to live there for the british troops
that are in aden are there for punish-
ment it being a station where the tough
boys are sent to make them tougher and
a better place could not be found

  the van tromp had to unload some
machinery so my uncle flane offered
to take martin and myself out to see
the great cement-lined tanks that the
queen of sheba is supposed to have had
built while waiting for a note from king
solomon flane had asked joyeuse to
accompany us but she thought the heat
was too great


the blue book magazine

  we reached the landing-stage where a
crowd of english soldiers stood around
with nothing to do but stare at the ships
in the harbor and we were standing to-
gether looking at the camel pulling the
town water-cart when something hap-
pened a small devil-fish of the sort
the natives eat was thrown from some
spot to the left of us and it struck my
uncle on the chest splattering him with
water and also putting a few scales and
bits of slime on the jacket of a big
highlander who was close to us

  the highlander gave a yell of rage
and looked around to see who had thrown
the thing his face as red as a boiled
lobster he made a move forward but
my uncle put out a hand and restrained
him

  it was intended for me said flane

  but mon will ye be looking at me
jacket cried the scotchman ill be
pullin the muckin head off the black-
faced devil

  but flane held him pushing him to
the rear as he walked toward the man
who had thrown the devil-fish and the
man was no stranger to us he was the
black-browed brute who had come aboard
the van tromp at suez in the company
of schiemann

now the soldiers who had nothing to
do and were loafing in the sad way
of soldiers became as bright as hornets
when they heard the yell of the high-
lander and saw the possibility of a fight
they looked from the black-browed
bruden to flane weighing them up in
their minds and they gurgled like chil-
dren for flane and bruden were two
big men who looked like fighters and
something told the soldiers there was a
hate of which they knew nothing behind
the throwing of the slimy devil-fish

  to the yard they cried in chorus
the yard where the police cant see it

  quick and smart were those boys and
it looked to me as if they had handled
many a fight around that landing-stage
there was an enclosed yard with a big
gate and a wall some fifteen feet in
height and into this yard they hustled
bruden and flane the soldier hurried-
ly closing the gate wished to put me out-
side but martin objected and i was
pulled within and the gate clanged

  the big highlander and martin were
flanes seconds and two soldiers sec-
onded bruden and from what he said
to them as they pulled his shirt over his
head they must have thought they had

a winner for they grinned when he
whispered to them telling them i sup-
pose that he would give my uncle a fine
thrashing

  and it didnt look such an easy matter
for flane for bruden was big with
great arms on which the muscles stood
up eo that one glancing at him quick
would think he was deformed and by
the way he acted it looked as if he knew
the business of fighting for when the
soldier lads appointed a referee he didnt
listen to the words of caution at all b-
ing so eager to get at it

  now said the referee lets have a
fair fight gentlemen no cat-scratch-
ing or bear-hugging let er go an-
other soldier beat on a piece of tin that
took the place of a bell and the fight
was on

  bruden thought to make short work
of my uncle he hurled himself across
the patch of sun-baked earth and he
started an overarm punch as he came-
a punch that would have cracked the
jaw of flane if it had landed which it
didnt for flane made a leap forward
and got inside it his own right fist land-
ing with a soft thud on the nose of the
other he ducked under a left counter
dancing clear he took a long straight
stab at the nose and landed again

  the big highlander shouted approval
the spots on his jacket making his sym-
pathy for my uncle greater than it would
have been for an ordinary stranger do
it again me bonnie laddie he cried
and flane took him at his word

  bruden was mad then the grin was
wiped off his ugly face and a look of
murder was planted there instead he
was puzzled by the quickness of flane
for my uncle was a hornet that jumped
in when he had a chance and then sprang
clear leaving the effects of his sting be-
hind him and the soldiers gurgled with
delight and the hot mad sun of aden
blazed down on the yard and from
without came the shouts of arabs and
above the shouts was a hammering on
the big door the military police having
got word that something was going on
in the yard

bruden rushed and grabbed flane
around the waist he lifted him from
the ground and tried to throw him over
his head in spite of the referee who
struggled to pull the big arms from
my uncles waist but flane wasnt
troubled if the fellow wanted wrestling
he could have it and as i stared at the
the treasure of vanished men	 

two my mind went back to the night in
marrakech when flane wrestled ahmed
mansour the golden-skinned arab on a
roof-top the feet of flane left the
ground and bruden gathered himself
for a mighty hoist but as he did so
something happened to him it might
have been a trick of ju-jitsu but i am
not sure anyhow the big arms of him
loosened for an instant and in that in-
stant flane wriggled clear and attacked

  one two three bruden stumbled
backward with flane after him would
you throw a fish at me  screamed
flane landing blow after blow not let-
ting the other get set for a moment
ill wager youll have trouble in smell-
ing the next one he shouted as a
tremendous wallop landed on brudens
nose-his guard being useless to protect
his face from the storm of blows

the big highlander was crazy with
oy the soldiers were on their toes
yelling and the military police were
climbing over the gate and over the
walls swearing as they dropped down
into the yard bruden was running-
running round and round the ring till
at last flane caught up with him and
dropped him with a clip under the ear

  it looked as if thered be a dozen fights
to follow for the military police were
mad at having to climb the wall and
madder still that they had been kept
away from a good fight and to cap the
uproar some joker threw another bit of
stale fish at the jacket of the big high-
lander and he was nearly insane be-
cause he couldnt find out which of his
mates did it and there was murder in
the air the hot throbbing suffocating
air that might have come out of the
ventilators of hell

  well cut out the visit to the tanks
said flane as he pulled on his coat
this is a bad town

  we pushed our way through the mill-
ing soldiers who were arguing and shout-
ing at each other and we got a boat at
the landing and were rowed back to the
van tromp

  youre back quick said thurland
when we climbed the ladder	

  they didnt like us growled flane
and that was all as far as i know that
he said about the fight

  the van tromp had unloaded her
machinery and was ready to move on
but the captain waited for bruden the
siren screamed but we could see no
hurrying passenger at the landing

 the town and tried to cool the temper of
 captain oudegeest

   the captain cursing all passengers
 signaled the engine-room but at the
 very moment the van tromp swung
 for the outer sea a boat left the landing-
 stage the four arab oarsmen flailing the
 water madly it was bruden-bruden
 with a bandaged head he had to be
 assisted up the ladder and he wabbled
 a little as he went to his cabin

   my uncle thurland looked at flane
 but flane was studying the shore-line
 running down to steamer point flane
 could be very silent at times

chapter xiv

toward rangoon

on the chart in the saloon of the
van tromp were lines which showed
the course of the winds in the different
seas and looking at them i often
thought that a chart showing the winds
of hate that blew around the van tromp
would be interesting for winds of hate
were surely there as we moved across
the indian ocean and rolled up the bay
of bengal they came from the cabin
of schiemann and bruden puffs of fine
fury that you could feel as they passed
and captain oudegeest for some reason
or other took a great dislike to one and


the blue book magazine

all of us but especially the bonze yes
especially the bonze when the captain
saw the old monk on the deck he would
turn his head and spit into the scuppers
and the black eyes of the ancient would
glitter with hate as he observed him

  and the sailor with the big lobes
watched us with no love on his face and
the shadowy officer who was called the
doctor and who was always half-drunk
didnt like us at all he having got a
quick push from flane when he annoyed
joyeuse by trying to flirt with her

  the bonze was the root of all the
trouble aye of every little bit of it
that change in him that we noticed
when the van tromp entered the canal
became more evident with each league
we covered there went out from him
a feeling of mystery and power-went
out over the ship the dutch steward
who had grinned at him when he first
came aboard was now afraid of him
the first officer of the steamer would
never pass the monk if there was another
way jound and the sailors would stand
in little knots and stare at him when he
was on the deck

  but the old man seemed to be blind to
the fact that the whole ship was inter-
ested in him he went through his exer-
cises of breathing in a corner of the
deck and he made no attempt to speak
to anyone but the count of his food
he was particular the water that he
drank he put in the sunshine for thirty
minutes before he drank it so that it
could be made alive by the rays of
the sun and the wheat he ate he placed
for some days in a little water till it
germinated eating it then because it too
became alive and was filled with a
new strength this the count explained
to joyeuse and to me

  the hatha yoga has been practiced
in the east for thousands of years said
the count there are men who can do
things that seem supernormal because
they have concentrated for years on get-
ting control of their bodies they can
regulate the beating of their hearts and
raise or lower their pulse at will

  can he do that asked joyeuse

  i think he can answered the count

it was on a morning when we were with-
in two days steam of rangoon that
captain oudegeest stirred the temper of
the bonze the captain was walking
around the deck while the old man was
examining a dish of wheat that showed
the faintest trace of sprouting the

captain was in a bad humor he thrust
out a big boot and kicked the dish over-
board

  the monk sprang to his feet and the
captain moved back from him as if
afraid of something that he saw in the
glittering eyes then the captain cried
out something in dutch that sounded
like a yelp of fear and it was that yelp
that roused the count who was sleep-
ing in a deck-chair

  the count took one look at the monk
and the captain then he ran swiftly
toward them the right hand of the
old man thin and clawlike was moving
upward as it had moved on the night in
the villa mille fleurs when he had
snapped his fingers in the face of the
guard that had played him false-mov-
ing up slowly in the same frightening
manner the palm turned outward

  the count reached the side of the old
man he caught the thin wrist of the
monk and jerked the hand downward
speaking swiftly and earnestly

the monk listened the anger left his
face he turned and walked away
captain oudegeest had staggered back
against the rail white-faced and silent
he stood when the count turned to him

  you fool cried the count what
did you do to him

  i-i stammered the captain why
i joost kicked a dish of his tamned
wheat off my ship

  you nearly kicked yourself into hell
snapped the count

  the captain did not speak he turned
and went slowly to his cabin he ap-
peared stunned a sailor bending an
awning over the deck had seen the in-
cident and spread the story around the
ship the crew whispered to each other
and stared at the monk

  the captain ate his meals in his cabin
during the two days that followed the
incident we hardly caught a glimpse
of him till the van tromp shouldered
into the forest of masts at the mouth of
the rangoon river and the great shin-
ing pile of the shwe dagon pagoda
dazzled our eyes

  here was the real east-the east we
had dreamed of it came to us drugging
our senses stirring mad dreams giving
to us a belief in the story of the monk
so that my uncles thurland and flane
and also john jefferson martin drooled
like hounds within reach of their prey
for just around the corner of the tongue
of jand that is the malay peninsula was
the treasure of vanished men



saigon and beyond saigon was the mys-
terious angkor and the great mekong
up which had gone the long pirogues
laden with treasures so wonderful that
the very description of them took ones
breath

  as johnny riley said when they put
the rope round his neck it wont be
long now  muttered thurland

  flane nodded and squared his shoul-
ders he was standing with joyeuse
their eyes turned upon the shwe dagon
i think the strangeness of rangoon with
all the clamor of the pool frightened
joyeuse she put out her little hand and
touched the sleeve of flanes coat then
the big hand of my uncle stole up and
swallowed it as if it were something that
his strong fingers were hungry for i
knew then that joyeuse loved flane and
that he worshiped her

  we said no good-bys to captain oude-
geest and we didnt trouble about the
yellow-faced schiemann and the black-
browed bruden the magic of the east
had us bringing a confidence that was
surprising for it seemed that the very
fact that you longed for something would
bring it to you for that same longing is
the religion of the orient a fine lazy
religion you just sit and yearn and
yearn and yearn whispering your de-
sires to the old stone gods giving them a
wilted flower or a few grains of rice
hoping to stir their generosity to give
you something that a little hustle on
your own part would get you in a tenth
of the time you spent in asking the gods

chapter v
tohsaroth the holy one

now the bonze had to visit the shwe
dagon pagoda for the shwe dagon
is a living throbbing thing that cannot
be treated with contempt there it is
with its great pelt of gold squatting in
the sunshine the stream of prayers from
millions going up into the hot mad sun-
shine of burma- and with the prayers
go up the incense from thousands of smok-
ing sticks and the odor of the flowers that
are piled around the stone god-the
stone gods that have a sort of cynical
grin on their faces as if they knew that
the business was foolish and that noth-
ing would come of the praying and the
offerings nothing at all

  the count wished to hunt around for
a steamer to take us to saigon but the
bonze would do nothing till he went to

the pagoda and dressed now in the
yellow robe of his order he led us for-
ward in a manner that showed he had
been there before hundreds of times
before and his knowledge of the place
together with the throb and the passion
that we felt around us made a backing
for his great story of the flight from
angkor so that the smallest grain of
doubt fled from our minds and like
lambs we followed him-followed him
barefooted into the great pagoda and
into as fine a mess of trouble as one
could think of

  the bonze left us to go into an inner
shrine where a few hairs from the head
of the buddha are kept and into which
we couldnt go being unbelievers so
we stood and sniffed the incense and the
perfume of jasmine and lotus and crushed
marigolds wondering how long the old
man would take with his prayers be-
cause if we could judge by the looks of
those who passed to and fro with naked
feet the sooner we left there the better

  ten minutes went by-fifteen twenty
martin picked up a flower that had
dropped on the floor but a monk snatched
it from his hand and placed it before a
stone figure

  they dont like us here said thur-
land we had-

  my uncle didnt finish his remark for
at that moment the bonze appeared and
with him were fifty or sixty yellow-robed
monks that ran around him touching
him whenever they could with their long
brown fingers and gurgling with holy
joy as they did so gurgling and jab-
bering and calling him by a name we
had never heard before a queer name
that later we found to be the same as


the blue book magazine

one of the four gods that rule the cam-
bodian paradise it was tohsaroth to
us he had been methuselah the an-
cient the old one or any other
foolish name that came to our mind
but to them he was tohsaroth the holy
one and we were impressed

  the swarm rolled down on us pushing
us this way and that as the monk tried
to get close to the astonished count to

for days the ancient had watched the mate
kicking the half-starved pilgrims now
the mate was going to get his aye

tell him who they were and why they
were running round him like starving
cats around a fishmonger and the eyes
of the count showed surprise as he
listened and the hubbub grew louder
and ever more monks came running un-
til-what with the hot thrusting bodies
-we were in danger of being smothered

  what the devil does it mean cried
thurland

  theyre a pilgrim party from his own
district shouted the count theyre
from pnom-penh from pnom-penh on
the mekongi

  the words choked us the bunch of
lean starved-looking fellows that ran
around the bonze were from the capital
of cambodia from the town that was
within a few hours of angkor itself
they had seen the evening star rise and
rest upon the mysterious ruins they
had squatted on the great terrace from
which the king and his nobles had taken
their departure in the long ago

  we were impressed astounded be-
wildered by the happening we were in
the company of over half a hundred men
who were actual residents of the place
toward which we had been moving since
the bright morning we had fled neuilly
in fear of the police

to us it seemed we were already
there the pushing chattering army
that surrounded the bonze gave a new
quality to his tale a new glamour and
force that brought also a fear to us-lest
we be tricked or outmatched by others
who had heard fragments of the tale

  get him out of here said thurland
to the count therell be a riot if we
stay here

  the count took the arm of the monk
and led him down the great stone stair-
way but the army streamed after him
fighting to get next to him crying his
name tohsaroth tohsaroth claw-
ing and scratching at thurland and mar-
tin who tried to discourage them push-
ing flowers into the old mans face and
down his neck running in frontbf him
and dropping petals that he could tread
on and which they then picked up and
held to their lips

  ill be damned if i ever saw a home-
coming like this growled thurland
youd think the old fellow had won
the heavyweight championship of the
world

we had left flane and joyeuse at the
foot of the stairway because joy-
euse didnt like the idea of going farther
into the great pagoda and now to the
astonishment of the two of them we
streamed down like a rabble that is try-
ing to rescue a friend from the police

  and that description is not far from
the truth for the new-found friends of
the bonze wanted the old man to leave
the count and stay with them and that
didnt suit us at all we had traveled
a long way with the ancient and we
were determined to stick to him toh-
saroth holy or unholy was our property

  thurland shouted the news to flane
as the mob swept them along flane do-
ing his utmost to protect joyeuse from
the crazy devils who wished to walk
close to the bonze into the narrow
streets went the human flood the shaved
heads of the monks shining in the fierce

the treasure of vanished men


the blue book magazine

sunlight pushing a way through chinese
sikhs burmese karens hindoos and
malays and now it came close to a
riot for here and there the mob knocked
over the stall of a man selling rice-cakes
or sweets and the devils own argument
started as to who would pay for it

  the count shouted to thurland what
tohsaroth said about mob and the wishes
of the mob the pilgrims from pnom-
penh were starting home that very after-
noon as deck-passengers on a specially
chartered coastal packet that had
brought them down from saigon and
they wished our methuselah to travel
with them they not only wished it-
they demanded it and they were pre-
pared to give battle to us or any other
body that tried to take him away from
them he was a super-bonze it seemed
and it was a compulsory service that they
were called upon to perform

  and what does he think  cried
thurland when the count explained

  he wants to go with them shouted
the count

  then well go with him and the mob
said thurland promptly

down the narrow streets to the water-
front upsetting stools and sweetmeat
stalls carrying with us all the poor pa-
tient folk that came up against us
shrieks and prayers and curses the
proud pilgrims from pnom-penh shout-
ing out the virtues of the ancient our
ancient that we had brought back to the
east-the east that knew his value that
respected him that worshiped him as a
person upon whom the stone gods had
conferred immortality

  police fought the procession with fists
and truncheons they were thrust aside
or carried with us vainly half a dozen
of them made a rush to get to tohsaroth
thinking that he was a sort of queen bee
of the swarm and that if he could be
grabbed and put somewhere then the
mob would break up and go home but
the pilgrims bit and scratched to pro-
tect him and with chants and the bang-
ing of little tambours and the ringing of
bells we reached the gangway of the old-
est and dirtiest steamer i had ever seen

  it was the kelantan and it had
brought the pilgrims around from saigon
it was a trollop of the china sea a thing
that wise sharks would follow their ears
listening to the groaning of her old
timbers

  the skipper was a huge dane and
every man on her was of the same na-

tionality stripped to his waist the cap-
tain shouted and struck at the pilgrims
when they stood to chatter on the gang-
plank a mate as big as himself pushed
them around on the dirty deck cursing
and kicking the poor devils when they
didnt obey his orders to him the pil-
grims were cattle his hand and his boot
were heavy on their ill-fed bodies

the count attempted to speak to the
captain but the captain had a con-
tempt for small men and pushed him
aside thurland took the matter up
then and there was something on thur-
lands face that brought politeness from
the dane he said he had no cabin ac-
commodations for anyone no matter
what sum they offered andas for carry-
ing a female he had sworn by all the
norse gods that he would never ship one
on a boat he bossed not half a vum-
min  he roared they is to me the
bad lucks

  thurland spoke to the count let
flane and joyeuse and jimmy go on an-
other boat he said you and i and
martin will stay with this swarm
please let me stay i cried

  itll be rough said thurland

  i dont mind i cried let martin
stay with joyeuse and flane

  the mate was chasing the last strag-
glers onto the wharf grabbing carelessly
at a man here and there and thrusting
him toward the gangplank he caught
several poor devils who belonged to
rangoon thinking to make up the num-
ber that he wanted and the captured
ones screamed with terror at the thought
of going to sea in the kelantan and
well they might one required the fine
spirit of religious sacrifice to sail on that
boat and perhaps the local monks that
saw the shwe dagon pagoda every day
of their lives didnt have the same fervor
that brought the pnom-penh crowd
anyhow they kicked and squealed when
the mate tried to pull them aboard the
steamer had brought seventy-five pil-
grims and the mate wanted seventy-five
to take back

  thurland and the count spoke to
flane joyeuse and martin they were
to take the fastest boat for saigon and
if they got there before us which was a
certainty they were to wait till we ar-
rived

  and you might have to wait a hell of
a long while growled thurland turning
to take a look at the old trull that was
to carry us
the treasure of vanished men	

  we shook their hands and went aboard
to see the danish captain he was in a
hot dispute with his engineer the latter
swearing that the engines were in such a
condition that the kelantan couldnt
cross the gulf of martaban much less
reach saigon

  were going with you said thur-
land quietly

  yous vat screamed the captain
you heard me said thurland
were buying deck passage with the
pilgrim folk

 the dane put a huge hand on my
uncles chest and started to push him to-
ward the gangplank but he didnt push
him far thurland caught the fore-
finger of the captain a forefinger as big
and as stout as the leg of a small chair
and he bent it back with such quickness
and force that the captain howled with
the pain it brought

  i dont like people putting their
hands on me said thurland letting
go of the fleshy chair-leg now be
sensible and say quick how much the
three of us will pay for a ride on this
undertakers barge

  the captain rubbed his forefinger and
glared at my uncle seven hundred
straits dollars  he cried and although
that was about ten times the price he
charged per head to the pilgrims the
count paid

  the kelantan was ready to move on
the mate having made a tally and found
that he had seventy-five passengers and
if they werent the same seventy-five
that he had brought to rangoon he
didnt care he ordered the gangplank
pulled in and the ropes cast off the
engines coughed and we edged into the
pool above the screaming of the
jostling hundreds that were interested
in our methuselah we heard the voice
of flane who was standing with joyeuse
and martin

  pleasant voyage he cried its
fine to think of you traveling in such
luxury

it was strange about the start of that
voyage to me and i think to thur-
land and the count there came  belief
that we were on the last lap of the
journey that we were really on the
dark mekong up which the pirogues
had taken the treasures and the fleeing
nobles perhaps it was the presence of
the pilgrims that created the atmosphere
that brought to us the feeling that we
should see at any minute the banks of

that great river stumbling down to the
sea through the wild passes of the un-
known country the banks with their
high trees in which are thousands and
thousands of monkeys sitting so close to-
gether that their tails hang down like a
fringe from the branches on which they
squat for that is how the ancient de-
scribed them when telling of the flight
from angkor-thom and i thought if i
shut my eyes i could hear the screaming
of the flamingoes and cormorants that
followed the pirogues

  yes thurland thought the same for
when we rolled out of the mouth of the
rangoon river he looked at me and
smiled well soon be there now he
said quietly i mean at klang-nan

chapter xvi

the monk strikes a second time

oly men said my uncle thur-
land looking at the pilgrims on
the kelantan can stand sufferings that
would kill strong men like myself who
have no saintliness to boast of

  thurland was right the mob of the
kelantan went through enough physical
torture to earn each one a seat in his
particular paradise and they made no
complaints at all they were filled with
a fine fervor that made it impossible for
them to register pains and aches and
they had their stomachs under such con-
trol that a handful of rice was a feast

  and they had tohsaroth to look at-
tohsaroth whose presence brought the
thrills of the other world to which they
were fighting their way with prayer and
fasting they clustered around him on
the dirty deck of the steamer and when
he spoke their heads were thrust to-
ward him as if the missing of a single
word was a sin our methuselah was a
god to them

  the kelantan stumbled down the
gulf of martaban felt her way nervous-
ly by the little islands of the mergui
archipelago and headed for the malacca
strait and the mob prayed and chant-
ed hymns and slept and the captain
and the engineer quarreled nine times a
day about the engines and whenever
the big mate was in a temper he kicked
a pilgrim and the pilgrim would howl
and look at the ancient whose black
eyes glittering with anger followed the
mate

  i hope said thurland that the
mate doesnt try to make a football out


rhe blue book magazine

of our old friend i had better caution
him

  the count nodded and thurland but-
tonholed the mate as he went by and
spoke quietly to him listen laddte
said thurland i see you are a bit
handy with your feet so ill give you a
warning if you kick the old man youll
be kicking dynamite

  i kicks who i pleases roared the
mate

  good said thurland but dont
say i didnt warn you

  the mate to show his contempt for
the advice booted a sick pilgrim into
the scuppers and spat at a small gilded
buddha a tough man was the mate

  there was a fellow like him in kerry
once said thurland a chap so handy
with his feet that he wore the toes out of
his boots kicking dogs and cats and chil-
dren that came in his path one night
going home from a fair he saw what he
thought was a small boy sleeping in the
hedge and he gave him a root with the
toe of his brogue the little fellow
hopped up and the kicker saw then that
it was a leprechaun

  why did you do that asked the
leprechaun

   i dont know said the kicking
gentleman its in me blood i think
the leprechaun waved a little hand
at the fellows feet then with a grin
he said lift your boots me bouchal
the man tried to lift his boots but
he could only get them three inches off
the ground not an inch higher try as
he would

  now said the leprechaun youre
cured of your bad habits and if you have
the desire to kick a sleeping body in a
hedge you cant on your way now be-
cause im a little tired

  the man shuffled off home pushing
one foot after the other and from that
day to the day he died he went round in
the same fashion i saw him when i
was a little boy and my own father told
me the story

we bought food from the captain at
least we bought what provisions he
had and we cooked them on a charcoal
stove on deck rice and canned beans
and biscuits and danish cheese and
coffee and once we had a chicken from
the mates private crate the pilgrims
saved a little rice to feed the chickens
forgetting that the owner of the birds
was a brute who ill-treated them at
every opportunity

  there were cockroaches on the kdan-
tan that were as big as sparrows and
there were yellow scorpions also bed-
bugs that had been with the steamer for
years and years and there were humor-
ous ticks that burrowed under your skin
and laid eggs there the pilgrims
wouldnt kill them it being against their
religious teaching and the cockroaches
scorpions bugs and ticks knew that they
were safe and took liberties

  but we like the pilgrims had some-
thing to cheer us up and make us forget
the troubles of the moment something
that brought colorful dreams in the
steaming days and in the hot nights
when the poor devils moaned prayers in
their sleep and the crazy engines pound-
ed and the captain drank gin-slings and
cursed the sea we were on the last lap
of our voyage thurland danced a jig as
the cross-winds from the china sea
rolled the kelantan backward and for-
ward till the pilgrims thought she would
roll so far that she couldnt straighten
herself and they werent far wrong in
thinking that for wicked winds came
across from borneo and slammed the
old thing in the ribs so that she stag-
gered under the attack

  straight ahead of us said thurland
is cochin china with the mekong pour-
ing itself into the sea if nothing hap-
pens in the next sixty hours well be
going up the river like the pirogues that
fled the plague mother o me like
the pirogues that fled the plague

the happening thurland feared took
place when we had passed the island
of pdulo condove where they get swal-
lows nests that are worth their weight
in gold to make soup of we were
swinging a little to the east to make
saigon when the danish mate got an-
noyed with a pilgrim and booted him so
hard that the wretch screamed with the
pain

  our methuselah raised a protest but
the mate was so mad that he wouldnt
listen he continued to kick the pilgrim
and tohsaroth got to his feet the mate
thought this a sort of challenge and he
made a rush and clipped the old one
under the ear

  thurland let out a roar and made for
the mate swinging his fists as he came
but the mate had never been trained in
the use of his hands and had never heard
of the marquis of queensberry he was
a kicker knowing tricks with his feet
like the french know and which they
the treasure of vanished men	- 

call savate he made a quick leap into
the air bringing his right foot up in a
roundabout fashion and walloping thur-
land on the ear with the heavy boot

  it was a fine hefty kick and it would
have brought an elephant to his knees
thurland dropped as if he had been shot
and the mate leaped forward and handed
him a couple of kicks in the ribs before
anyone could get close enough to stop
him he was in the act of putting in a
third when he stopped and looked at
tohsaroth-looked at him with startled
eyes

  the ancient had drawn himself up so
that he seemed inches taller and those
eyes of his that had no whites and were
like bits of black opal glowed like the
eyes of a cat in the dark the count
cried out to him and made a rush to stop
him from lifting his right hand but the
pilgrims got in the yay of the count and
hindered him and the old one took no
notice of the counts cries his temper
making him deaf to everything for
days he had watched the mate kicking
the half-starved pilgrims and spitting
on their poor gilded buddhas and now
the mate was going to get his aye

  the lean claw went up slowly palm
toward the sailor then the long fingers
snapped in a curious fashion and the
mate staggered backward against the
rail his face was yellow  his big mouth
was open and his eyes were pushed out
like the eyes of a crab clinging to the
rail he stared for a few moments at the
old bonze then he slipped into the scup-
pers

  the count screamed a warning as a
seaman moved forward dont touch
him cried the count wait

  the man stood back my uncle thur-
land was on his feet now he moved to-
ward the mate in the scuppers leaned
over him- turned and spoke to the count
hes dead said thurland

  the captain of the kelantan stumbled
down from the bridge swearing fright-
fully as he came he thrust the pilgrims
out of his way pushed the body of the
mate with a big sea-boot looked into his
face then turned and stared at the old
bonze

 by god he cried i knowt i
know oncet that swine bane come on
my sheep i know heem one bloody
killer tohsaroth the devil i chuck
him in de sea heem tohsaroth the
death-giver 

  he made a rush at the ancient but
thurland was in the way now-repaying

the action of the monk in saving him
from the boots of the mate steady
said thurland steady me bold gos-
soon  what do you think our nice
mate died of

  plague screamed the skipper
plague i haf heard of this swine he
kills he snaps his fingers so-an men
die i chuck the swine overboard  he
killed my mate

   but thurland held the big arms of the
skipper speaking softly to him as he
struggled if you think that me
bouchal he whispered i wouldnt lay
a finger on him it would be you that
wed be tossing overboard after he had
finished with you be quiet now and let
us think what we should do

   the captain saw the danger of pulling
any rough stuff on the old man who had
now returned to his seat there he was
mumbling prayers to himself his
wrinkled face upturned looking so quiet
that no one would suspect him of send-
ing a man into the other world a few
minutes before but the lads from
pnom-penh who clustered round him as
if they would claw the eyes out of the
captain knew they knew that he had
by some magic or other wiped out the
mate who had booted them whenever
they got in his way

  the captain was quiet now he stood
with thurland and the count looking at
the dead man and twothirds of the crew
stood with them the news had gone
	the blue book magazine

 down into the engine-room and a few
 of the boys that were feeding the crazy
 engine climbed up to have a look one
 of them wearing only dungaree pants
 and a sweat-cloth around his neck
 pushed me out of the way i looked up
 at him a little angry because he had
 handled me roughly and i had difficulty
 in choking the cry that came to my lips
 under the swipes of coal-dust and sweat
 i recognized his ugly mug it was the
 man bruden that flane had thrashed in
 the dock-yard at aden

  they straightened out the mate and
 placed him on a hatch-cover the cap-
 tain thurland and the count were
 whispering together the crew heads
 thrust forward tried to catch the words
 of the three the captain seemed
 frightened the crew didnt seem too
 pleased the angry chief engineer had
 come up from below and he pushed him-
 self into the argument

  thurland and the count suggested
 that the captain should at once bury the
 body of the mate lest the infection
 should spread but the captain who had
 a filthy copy of a little book of rules is-
 sued by the board of trade said that he
 couldnt he was the skipper of a coast-
 al boat and he had to bring the body
 into port
 j then its quarantine

 its damn well so screamed the
 captain three weeks one bloody
 month suddenly he broke down and
 commenced to cry tears as big as hail-
 stones rolled down his cheeks

   the chief engineer broke the silence
 with a burst of loud laughter the
 captain recovered himself swore fierce-
 ly at the engineer and stumbled up the
 ladder to the bridge the kelantan
 heading in for the entrance to the saigon
 river was then abreast of the mouths
 of the mekong the river of our dreams
 off to port the great stream seventh
 largest river in the world was pouring
 itself into the china sea through half a
 dozen openings

 i pushed my way to thurlands side
 bruden had been ordered below by the
 chief engineer i whispered the news

   are you sure asked thurland

   im certain i answered

   my uncle was quiet for a minute star-
 ing at a brown haze far off to the west of
 us a haze that became solid and firm
 till we knew it as the coast of cochin
 china the trouble is getting no thin-
 ner said thurland and thats what

jamesy gallagher said about his wife
when the reducing medicine didnt work
on her yes indeed jimmy

chapter xvii

we take french leave

we entered the saigon river with the
yellow flag flying at the masthead
the kelantan had been squirted with
disinfectant till the smell of her brought
insulting yells from the passengers and
crew of a boat of the grande ligne de
louest that passed us as we came into
the stream

  we anchored in the middle of the river
as the night was coming down far ahead
of us-the lights of the city twinkling in
the velvety dusk and from here and
there a faint note of music came to us to
tell of the gayety that was ashore for
saigon is the paris of the east and the
french exiles sit out on the terrasses of
the cafes and make themselves believe
that they are back on the boulevards

  river police in snorting motorboats
came alongside and shouted questions
through megaphones at the captain the
health authorities could not come aboard
till the next morning but we were to
stay put if the medical men found that
the mate had died of plague we would
be taken to the quarantine station and
held there till all danger had passed

  there is no danger said the count
but it is impossible to convince a
medical man that there isnt

  my uncle thurland muttered curses
and looked at the twinkling lights on
the quai francis-gamier and the line
of lamps on the bridges over the arroyo
chinois that runs into the saigon river
thurland was angry and there was no
one on whom he could spill his temper

  youre certain that was bruden he
asked me

  quite certain i said hes all
smeared with grease and coal-dust but
its him

  well said thurland if were quar-
antined theres a chance that ill give
him a better hiding than flane gave
him at aden

  the mention of his brothers name
made him turn and look at the lights of
the city if flane is here hell know
were in trouble he said softly and
trouble is a magnet that brings him at a
run now i wouldnt be surprised-
he paused and thrust his head forward
and stared at the dark river-water
the treasure of vanished men



  wouldnt be surprised at what i
said

  there was a laugh in thurlands voice
as he whispered his answer i wouldnt
be surprised to find him nosing about
this old tub he has a brain flane has
when he was a boy they thought of
making him into a priest or a professor or
something like that but the moment he
heard them planning he left home and
stayed away till they had forgotten
about it

  the count came across the deck and
thurland whispered his hopes the
count was thrilled the possibility of
a rescue lifted the sadness from our
hearts thoughts of a quarantine of
three weeks or more was something that
weighed hard upon our minds

  the hot heavy night rolled around us
-the night with a thousand odors that
stirred queer thoughts we were close
to our destination but the death of the
mate had put chains around our hurry-
ing feet ahead some few hours jour-
ney was pnom-penh and beyond was
the mysterious angkor on which the star
of evening looked questioningly down

  i thought that i could see it in the vel-
vety night-see the great towers the im-
mense stairways the thousand and ohe
sculptures of the seven-headed serpents
their stone heads spread fanwise guard-
ing this great shrine of the past our
nearness to it made me curiously faint

  the tired pilgrims had stretched them-
selves in long lines on the deck the
captain had slipped into a drunken
stupor the body of the mate covered
with a blanket soaked in disinfectant
showed in the shadows the kelantan
seemed a boat of death

after midnight it was then that
 thurland was roused by the pit-pit
of a motor-boat that came out of the ar-
royo chinois into the saigon river it
hung to the shore till it was opposite the
kelantan then the motor was cut sud-
denly and in the tremendous silence we
thought we heard the creak of oars

  the sound came nearer that splut-
tering engine was evidently too noisy for
the final approach the boat was being
pushed furtively toward the kelantan

  thatll be flane whispered thur-
land what a brother for a man to
have  his voice quavered as he spoke
i prayed that it might be flane so that
thurland would not be deceived

  closer closer came the boat we saw
it dimly on the oily water it rounded
the stern of the kelantan and the two
rowers were plain to us in the dull light
thrown by the riding-light-john mar-
tin and flane

thurland whistled softly the
boat slipped to the side of the steam-
er a whisper came up from it

  got to be quick said flane river
police

  thurland had knotted a rope to a
stanchion and tossed the other end over-
board martin grabbed it

  the bonze whispered the count

  leave him to me said thurland
down you go

  the count went over the side slid
down the rope and fell into the boat

  youre next jimmy ordered thur-
land and i followed the count more
awkwardly if possible falling into the
arms of martin who saved me from go-
ing overboard

  we stared upward waiting for thur-
land the counts excited breathing
could be heard above the gurgling of the
water against the ships side the count
was worried

  hell never get him he whispered

  he will said flane quietly leave
it to him he can do anything

  the silence was broken by the queru-
lous chatter of disturbed sleepers it
grew some one screamed there was
a shuffling of feet a cry of alarm then
thurland appeared on the rail with a
great bundle in his arms

  holding this bundle with his left arm
he grabbed the rope with his right
twisted his legs around it and came
with the speed of a bullet into the boat

  he gasped out an order to the count
speak to the old devil before he tries
any tricks with me he cried i had
to put a cloth over his head set that
engine going therell be hell to play
in a minute

  martin set the engine going swung
the nose of the boat in the direction of
the arroyo chinois and we fled into
the night the drunken skipper fired a
bullet at us the screech of a police
whistle came from the wharf of the
messageries maritimes and from the
pilgrims rose a prolonged howl that
sounded like the yelping of a fox-pack
that has lost the scent tohsaroth had
left them

  iii-the mother reef

the moon hung low across the sea
that night as we sat by our drift-
wood fire

  out across the palawan reefs the surf
was rolling and muttering creating dim
white streamers of phosphorescence that
eddied into the lagoon up on the higher
shores behind us were other fires other
tourists who were doing the philippines
on more active schedule were feasting
indulging in song and dancing buying
knickknacks and curios

  but we sat here by the water away
from all that myers of the constabu-
lary and old karlak moro of the
moros who had served ten years in the
force and had twice been on long visits
to america before returning to his
native village and the fish-nets and the
long boats and i was the third

  some of the boats lay out there be-
fore us rocking gently under the stars
off to our left on the shore was the
rotting carcass of the great boat karlak
had been showing us-one of the last of
the famous old malay stitched boats of
full schooner size a sea-going craft

  ive heard tell said myers reflec-
tively that boats of this kind stitched
together date from very ancient times
and mark one of the chief developments
in the art of ship-building too bad
karlak that you dont happen to know
who first thought up that kind of a
boat and why must have been one of
your people

  it was karlak said simply and
i do know	

 what i exclaimed you mean
you have some legend about it
karlak grinned and spat

  not legend but facts he said and
looked out to sea as he squatted on his
hams his old lined face a mass of
shrewd wrinkles it was a man out
there on the big mother of the reefs that

lies just over the horizon and it hap-
pened a very long time ago in the
ancient days when all my people were
idolaters before the prophet of allah
had told the world of the true god may
his name be blessed  this man bore
the same name that i bear today but he
was young and i am old

  young enough said myers slyly
i hear that there was a new son born
in your house last month

  the words drew a chuckle from kar-
lak

  allah is good allah is great he re-
joined complacently this was long ago
it was even before the time when yellow
barbarians of china traded with these
coasts only once or twice had these
infidels ever been seen by my people
yet at long intervals they had come out
of the sea and they knew these islands

  he fell silent for a time staring now
into the embers of the fire and i thought
he was listening to the faint laughter and
the music that drifted down from the
village behind but no he was listen-
ing to the reef-music as the long end-
less rollers burst upon the coral and
far greater was the sound out there on
the mother of the reefs across the hori-
zon the long coral islets that broke the
sea-surge sweeping in from uncounted
leagues where at low tide were vast ex-
panses of pools and exposed reef

in those pools in the now shallowed
lagoons huge treasure lay trapped at
each low tide-treasure of fish and shell
and octopus strange things drifted up
to the mother of the reefs too across
the trackless ocean that was why
karlak and his dozen men were out
there so far from the islands in search
of these treasures out there in the big
hollowed-tree canoe karlak had built
from one huge log fitted with sail and

outrigger and with ample cargo space
for the spoils of the sea

  karlak panjiran or sea-going chief
of the tribe had found a rich harvest
and his ungainly craft was deeply laden
but despite the risk of delayed depar-
ture for two hours he and his men had
been staring out at this queer vessel that
rode the tidal currents along the reef
a huge ship to his eyes a monstrous
thing with bulging lattice-like sails with
no crew in sight steering an aimless
course and yet ever drawing closer to the
opening in the reef then fell the calm
with the sea like a burnished shield
under the hot sun the strange huge
ship hung listless

quick it was their chance he
snapped swift word at his men
they leaped to the great canoe and
running it out seized paddles and headed
for the channel icol war chief of the
village was with him taking the stroke
paddle as the canoe emerged from the
reef every eye was turned on the ship
in momentary paralysis of fear and
vivid curiosity she was not two hun-
dred yards away unmoving deserted

  a trap  yelped icol a trap of the
water devils leave her alone

  shes falling to pieces said another
of the orang laut sea people have quick
eyes battered and smashed planks
hanging loose shes not a log but
many logs

  karlak stood erect a lithe handsome
bronze figure who might have been the
god of the reefs in person many logs
indeed that huge ship was built of
hewn logs of planks innumerable cut

from logs her idle sails were of woven
matting but she was falling apart
there were huge gaps in her bulwarks
her bows were split there was no sign
of life aboard her

  lay in the paddles ordered kar-
lak abruptly catching a riffle on the
water offshore breeze coming up
step the mast

  the men leaped to obey getting the
mast stepped laying the square carang
a light but tough woven sail ready
karlak stood by the steering paddle one
man to the tacks four to the halyards
icol and the others grasped spears and
knives

  look besar cried one of the men
excitedly a golden woman devil 
hearts leaped eyes strained karlak
felt his pulses hammer a figure was
crawling up the inclined poop deck of the
ship-a lithe golden half-clad figure a
woman lifting arms and waving franti-
cally a vision of shapely loveliness
the men gaped until the voice of icol
blared at them in new warning

  a trap a trap warriors are ready
behind those bulwarks while we make
sick-dogs eyes at the woman devil-
flee i tell you wake up karlak

  i am datu not you grunted karlak
i give orders-but youre right up
with the sail

  they had the breeze now the sail
went up karlak swung his weight on
the oar the canoe whipped around the
brails were let go the sheets hauled
aft and like a racer the great canoe
went hissing and foaming away

  but karlak looked back the yellow
woman still stood there though her
arms had fallen karlak fancied that
tears were streaming down her cheeks
slowly she dropped a dejected beaten
figure that sent a pang through him
devil or not trap or not-what a wom-
an  then she was gone from sight be-
hind the bulwarks and the canoe

  the men gaped
  until icol blared
  at them in warn-
  ing a trap
  warriors are
  behind those bul-
  warks while we
  make sick -dogs
  eyes at the wom-
  an devil flee i
  tell you
ships and men	

rushed through the seas toward the
islands over the horizon the ship did
not follow the men breathed freely
again karlak cursed the squat power-
ful figure of icol in the bow and looked
back again and again but in vain

  before the breeze the ship drifted
farther away from the reef again

  under the shattered and broken bul-
wark the yellow woman sat in collapse
tears were indeed glittering on her
cheeks tears of weakness of utter de-
spair in all that long stretch of reefs
with its trees and lagoons and glittering
white coral strands she had seen no
living creature except these men and
now they were gone 

  at the moment ming chu was far
from being the glorious pearl her
name bespoke her dulled eyes looked
along the hot decks here lay what
remained of her brawny crew of yellow
seamen dead or dying of bubonic plague
the black death her father had gone
long days ago yu the tiger that pow-
erful seaman and adventurer who served
as mate had skipped out with the small
boat two nights ago she was alone with
the dead and stricken

  until the breeze failed she had hoped
to get through an opening in the reef
this hope was gone now the light off-
shore breeze was beating the shattered
hulk farther from the reefs

for a long while she sat despondent
hopeless resigned then feeble voices
roused her she staggered up gave each
of the helpless yellow men a bit of the
precious water remaining then she
went to the rail and stared that canoe
with its brown sail had long since van-
ished ming chu who had spent most
of her life at sea with her father knew
the meaning of the ominous purple cloud
lifting in the sky spreading up from
the horizon to the east afternoon was
passing the storm would burst ere
sunset there was nothing to do but ac-
cept this final blow of fate

  weak wearied to nothing haggard
for want of sleep ming chu went to
the helm and lashed it she could not
lower the sails she cut them down then
made them fast off to the west was
the long reef smoking under the lash
of long ground swells she sank down
covered herself decently and awaited
death as night and storm approached

  death came from the sea the dreaded
baguio the black squall of the islands
the storm-devils tore at the laboring

shattered ship already soggy with
water in her hold the twisting ago-
nized hulk snapped the lashings of the
steering oar a giant comber pooped her
as she broached to tons of water flood-
ing aboard out of the darkness and
driving her helpless toward the reefs
once more weak thin screams shrilled
on the blast the decks were swept
bare of dead and dying

  ming chu moaned weakly if yu the
tiger were here there might still be
some hope although she hated that
wild adventurer with all her heart he
was strong in the will to live and in any
crisis fierce and swift as the tiger for
whom he was named but yu was
gone the coast of flowers was far away
death was close

  another tremendous wave hissed over
the doomed craft ming chu was
knocked to the deck but half-senseless
managed to wedge herself between a
mooring bitt and the poop bulwarks
the tremendous cannonading of the surf
on coral boomed even above the whining
shriek of the wind to leeward giant gey-
sers of spume shot skyward and then a
scream burst from ming chu as the
hulk dropped and dropped only to
heave up again on the great-grandfather
of all combers with a million wind-
devils lending impetus the hoary-crested
wave picked up the hulk and hurled it

  the coral reefs plucked up with eager
fingers but the foaming white sea-horses
lashed back tore triumphantly over the
barrier and spent themselves hissing on
a sandbar a thousand yards to leeward
and with them the hulk dropping to
pieces under the hammering smashed
into the sand little more than a heap of
wreckage

  so the night wore on and the squall
passed and dawn came hot and white

  the sunlight wakened ming chu she
sat up bleeding and battered and stared


the blue book magazine

wildly around then she realized that
she was stark naked stripped clean by
the sea to any woman of her race this
was the depth of shame she hastily
crawled among the wreckage that strewed
the whole lagoon shore while the white
sandfleas popped out of the coral sand
in all directions a torn strip of matting
from a sail wrapped about her body she
made it fast with a cord then took stock
of things

  here was the hulk little more than a
framework the entire beach was a mere
raffle of planks spars all sorts of litter
the big ship was actually fallen apart
yet it had been built as well as the yel-
low people knew how the planks fastened
with crude bronze clamps and bolts and
tied in place with shrunken bamboos
little these had availed against the stress
of hammering waves the strain of cargo
the brittle bronze had snapped or
slipped the split bamboo had burst
well enough for rivers even for coasting
voyages but not for the deep far sea

  water ming chu was afire with
thirst she searched the wreckage fran-
tically but vainly burst casks and jars
hampers of rice and dried fish swept to
nothing not a morsel of food not a
drop of fresh water everything of
metal had gone into the bed of the la-
goon something bulked under a pile of
planks and she tore them off in spas-
modic hope only to turn away listlessly
when she disclosed her fathers chest
she knew too well what was in that
chest the bow and the arrows her
father prized so greatly wrapped in
waterproof coverings and with them the
images of her gods small use to her
here either weapons or gods

  the sun mounted higher over a fairly
serene sea the sky was cloudless and
innocent as a babys eyes but the reef
was hot and the white coral sand re-
flecting the blinding rays radiated like
a gridiron ming chu felt the tortures
of thirst

she looked at the reef the trees the
thickets  useless to search if water
were here this place would be inhabited
but it was empty of life she studied her
fathers chart she had been here with
him two years ago five leagues off to
the southwest should be the island of
spotted snakes while the island of piant
lizards lay due east nearly as far out
of sight from here and the largest of
all the islands that of renegades was a
bit farther a place of fierce men of

large native towns of gainful trade but
she had no boat yu the adventurer
the strong burly master of his own des-
tiny had taken boat and water and chart
-everything would have taken her
too had he not thought her down with
the siokness of death

  wearily she turned and started
toward the pandanus scrub that fringed
the trees at least she must make the
search there was always a slim chance
of finding water somewhere

  half an hour later on the other side
of the reef she stared dejectedly out at
the vast expanse of jagged coral pools
and rock exposed at low tide far beyond
the mother reef itself no water no
living thing no food

ing chu the glorious pearl
-or her spirit i 

  the words pierced her brought her
around there half emerged from the
brush and staring at her was the power-
ful figure of yu bronze sword in hand
his slant eyes drugged with sleep and
dazed by sunlight

  yu her thickened tongue almost
refused duty yu cowardly dog son
of a turtle that you are    water i
water

  the tiger lowered his blade alive 
you are no spirit he muttered
water i have none i have nothing
but the boat it was on the shore the
water the food was all spoiled-
ming chu slumped hopelessly then
gathered herself

  we are both dead -people and shall
soon drink our fill from the nine springs
of eternity so enmity is a foolish thing
you have the boat then we can still
make the islands-

  a joyous blaring laugh broke from
the tiger his bold eyes had kindled
now he moved suddenly and with a leap
was beside her grasping her arms

  aye the islands you and i  he cried
youre my woman now-

  she fought against him with an up-
surge of vicious fury abruptly his
grasp loosened he went lax he stood
staring past her she turned silently
a shape of gleaming bronze had come
upon them-karlak who stood poised
in his hand the knife that denoted his
rank the balarao the throwing knife
with its balanced hilt of rough gold and
shark-skin

  drop it  cried karlak and the tiger
unclasped the sword he had whipped out
leave the woman alone yellow devil
ships and men



she is mine i am karlak panjiran of
the dusur people

  snarling yet aware of menace in the
brush around yu stood motionless
ming chu stared at the bronze shape of
karlak

  kuei beneficent dragon   she
croaked water water

  it is coming said karlak he strode
toward her an arrow-straight figure of
smooth muscle then halted touched
forehead and heart and smiled from
his bulging breech-clout of python-skin
he pulled out a length of scarlet grass
cloth this was his own bahag a com-
bination sarong and covering against the
night mist that no native went without

  he shook out the cloth and held it up
draped it about her shoulders and she
comprehended his wordless gesture then
he turned

  tubig water for the woman and
for this yellow devil

  other men were around but it was
icol the warrior who brought a joint of
cane and unstoppered it and held it to
the lips of ming chu she gripped at it
drank greedily but carefully and lowered
it again icol handed it to yu the tiger
those two men exchanged a quick com-
prehending look and yu drank

  karlak had watched them with a
frown now he gave sharp abrupt orders
the whole party started across the reef
to where the ship had been wrecked
explanations were simple the lingua
franca of all these islands was known to
yu and ming chu as to all traders from
the flowery land

  heading for home karlaks craft had
been caught by that sudden sharp blow
and he nothing loath ran before it back
for the reef and this morning with
patience of hunters they had tracked
down yu the tiger and the golden
woman as well and karlak knew he
had to deal with icol thfe warrior over
that woman the men would take no
sides in a private matter

evening saw all hands in camp near
the wreckage of the ship which had
been explored in vain for plunder when
ming chu claimed the chest karlak
gave it to her unopened whereat icol
scowled and spat oaths if plunder
lacked bits of bronze and other useful
things were plentiful the big canoe
was brought around into the lagoon and
so was the tigers small boat with its
oar and sail of matting all this while
yu had kept his head and held his peace

he was crafty this adventurer he had
been places he had dealt with such
island men as these before now

in the westering sunlight karlak took
ming chu to the beached framework
of the ship his tawny eyes reflected
strange glints of fire as he bade her tell
him how such a craft was made using
the small boat to illustrate her point she
explained the split bamboo withes the
bronze clamps the hewing of great
planks from logs karlak and his people
had soft iron but no bronze and any
tools aboard the ship had been lost but
he could see quickly enough how futile
had been such means of fastening a great
ship together against the endless ham-
mering thrust of the sea and it was
easy to comprehend the massive frame-
work of this ship

  they talked of themselves too and
later that night when as now the ma-
lay folk loved to talk about the fires
while the surf pounded on the reef
karlak heard of her father of this un-
lucky voyage of the tiger his heart
kindled to the silken loveliness of her
and glorious pearl looking upon this
bronze god of the reef felt the liver turn
to water withiji her she admitted the
fact karlak who had no understanding
of the chinese phrase thus translated
burst into laughter and took her to the
tent he had erected near the wreck from
one of her own matting sails

  the orang laut stared after the two of
them red grins wreathing their faces
icol also stared gripping at the knife in
his girdle his broad flat features atwist
with rage when he glanced at the yel-
low man the prisoner he met the bold
quick eyes of the tiger fastened upon
him in that look an unspoken question
was asked and answered then icol rose
his lean brown hand flicked the hilt of
his barong and a smile came to his lips
as though the touch of the knife had
brought it

  karlak came back alone the gold-
en woman is mine he said bluntly
everybody to sleep for we have work
tomorrow bind the yellow devil and
to sleep

  more work than he knew or dreamed 

  that night there was a new moon a
crescent moon that glimmered for a
while and dipped under the horizon
after its passing the warrior icol rose
very quietly and loosed the bonds of the
captive tiger and well away from the
camp they conferred together for a long
the blue book magazine

time squatting in the sand and talking
they went side by side and looked at the
great outrigger canoe drawn up above
high-water mark still holding its huge
load of fish plundered from the reef
pools

  it is too much for us said icol
take the small one but first-
they laughed softly and from the
fires icol brought embers which he laid
under the canoe amidships and put other
wood on the embers

  the woman is mine remember the
tiger said after a time when they had
made ready the small boat putting water
and food in it to you the balarao the
golden-hilted knife of the chief but to
me the woman later when we sell her
we divide the price

  agreed said icol and all this
gold of yours we divide also

now passed some little time from
the shelter of ming chu came slight
sounds a gasp and silence under the
stars the tiger came striding down to
where the small boat lay the womans
figure in his arms she was bound and
gagged he set her in the sand and
laughed in her ear

  glorious pearl you are the tigers
woman now he breathed exultantly
these fools take the bronze fittings to

be gold this squat barbarian is tempted
by it and we go to people he knows
perhaps we return here-who can tell
be happy ming chu for youre the
tigers bride well put you aboard
when he comes with the golden knife of
this-chief he is killing-

karlak wakened suddenly there
was an interval in the booming of
the surf in it the sand crunched under
naked heel he looked up and saw a fig-
ure against the stars in the same in-
stant he writhed aside rolled over
clutched his throwing-knife as he came
up-all one movement the startled swift-
ness of a wild animal in his instinctive
motion

  icol missed the blow of his six-pound
barong the sharp soft iron blade went
whick into the coral sand then karlak
with a yell was leaping at him icol
turned and ran for it glanced back saw
karlak poised desperately frantically
he leaped aide the throwing-knife
whistled where he had been next in-
stant he was plunging for the boat and
the tiger with a growl of sheer fury had
to give up his prey-it was choice be-
tween woman and life and he took life

 karlak stumbled over the bound
figure paused to cut it free saw the
small boat slithering out across the
lagoon for the reef passage her sail up
and bulging his men came running
yelling spears streaking the night but
the boat was safely away with one ac-
cord they jumped for the big outrigger
-and then stood stupefied staring at the
two parts of it the craft had been eaten
asunder by the fire even to patch it up
was impossible

  the taunting laugh of icol drifted
from the water well be back
friends and the growl of yu the
tiger added a curse to the prophecy

  karlak with the woman beside him
and his men respectfully squatting be-
fore him faced the dawn and the hard
future icols mother was of the balin-
bing pirate folk the two would go and
bring those fierce slavers upon them
eager for dusur blood it would not be
quickly done but it would be done

  we have food and water in plenty
said karlak once dismay was past
without a boat we cannot get home
therefore i shall provide a boat-such
a boat as no man of the dusur has ever
seen but i must talk with the gods

  that was logical karlak went alone
into the darkness to seek speech with
ships and men	q

the gods he squatted beside the bulk
of the wrecks framework ming chu
had told him what the tiger had said
and how icol took the bronze to be gold
well so had the others he himself half
believed it to be gold despite the
womans words

  this great ship of the yellow folk-if
any man could build such a ship that
would be seaworthy and strong he would
have the world at his feet karlak was
no dim groping savage but of a race that
did things the framework bulked
above him in the starlight it was heavy
enough it could be pegged to make it
stouter but those planks-his brain
went searching among the handicrafts of
his people no tools here plenty of
cane on the reef yes rattan of all sorts

  he touched the matting sail-remnants
queer woven stuff this matting noth-
ing like as strong and resilient as rattan
-ah by the gods he leaped up in
a blaze then sank down again it could
be done but there were no tools how
to bore holes he stared up at the
dawn-hints in the sky a scrap of talk
from the men drifted over to him

  i still have the scars from the bites
of those accursed anay i saw some here
on the reef too-the little devils are
everywhere

  the anay i fantastic yes but better
than boring holes with bits of the bronze
the planks would not be weakened it
might work it might work karlak
came to his feet again his excitement
whipping up he stalked over to the
fire

  men his voice blared at them
wakened the yellow woman from her
doze the firelight struck on him
brought out all his vivid eagerness the
ship is here we have the frame with
wooden pegs we can strengthen it repair
it you have heard how the women of
the balinbings make thelittle boats those
people use on the rivers  we shall make
this great ship again in the same way
use these planks and timbers cut down
that queer poop-

  we have none of this golden metal
we cannot work it said a man

  fool i we need no metal i have
just told you stitch the ship together
stitch it from stem to stern and back
again with rattan out and gather the
green cane and we need help from the
anay-from those very ant-people you
were just cursing out with the dawn
and hunt for them ants plenty of
them bujuco and rattan plenty of it i

 the ships keel is unbroken the timbers
 are good but the wood is like iron
 iron indeed this wood-hard red teak
 all of it even the planks too hard for
 soft iron to pierce

   with the dawn karlak set his men to
 work and ming chu flung herself into
 the task with him she had seen many a
 ship built but not in this strange fashion

   the planks were laid out in separate
 piles sound and broken by cutting
 down the lines of the ship there were
 enough and to spare cordage and sails

drop it cried karlakarul the tiger un-
clasped the sword he had whipped out

 everything was salvaged and drawn high
 and the framework laid out above high
 water and pegged stoutly

 then watching as the holes were
 bored ming chu shrieked with laugh-
 ter many of the anay those giant white
 boring ants had been collected and the
 orang laut knew how to handle them
 a malay would grasp an ant carefully
 take a small shell in the other hand
 and dropping the ant into the shell clap
 it quickly on the plank

   the furious ant turning from the hard
 shell would bore through the teak wood
 as it emerged triumphant on the other
 side it would be caught and set to work
 again ming chu insisted on trying this
 novel tool and was so severely bitten
 that she writhed in agony on the hot
 sand-and tried no more

   the outer timbers were seized to the
 framework most of the stringers and
 strakes being sound enough the ship
 had been hammered apart rather than
 smashed the tough bujuco stripped
 of its poisonous thorns and rattan soaked
 in water until pliable did the work

  and as the ship grew with everyone
toiling from dawn to dark and after the
dusur chief and the glorious pearl drew
closer though there was no time for love
to the woman he was a never-ending
amazement totally unlike her own people
as he was karlak had no lucky or un-
lucky days but his ingenuity met and
conquered each problem that arose to
karlak this golden creature was woman
yes and she set his spirit in a flame
but for the present he treated her exactly
as one of his own men though he talked
often with her

  and all this while she kept the chest
that had been her fathers prayed some-
times to the gold and vermilion gods
and said nothing of the weapons therein

the ship grew to the amazement of
those men grew until the shapely hull
was all complete there were no coco-
nuts here on the mother reef but their
sail and mats were of coconut fiber this
they worked into tow for caulking and
used tree-resin with powdered shell for
the outer caulking once back at home
this could be greatly bettered with bees-
wax and other products but all they
cared about now was getting home

  then came the great day when they
rolled the ship down into the water and
saw her afloat save for needed repairs
the steering-oars of the original craft
had come through well enough the spars
and sails and cordage were worked over
they were at work in the dawn stepping
the masts when one of the men who had
been up among the trees came tearing
down with wild yells

  balinbing the slave-hunters

  he dashed in among them with re-
port two giant proas or war canoes
were in sight far northward but evident-
ly working down along the reefs karlak
cursed under his breath

  so icol has brought the pirate folk
down on us eh look alive men
he shouted theyre searching the la-
goons theyll not get here before mid-
afternoon if then off and out of here
before they come stake everything on
our ship

  for the two masts the original sails
had been worked over-no job to boast
about true but these dozen men were
working only for the short voyage home
once there karlak knew that he could
refashion this ship to his hearts desire

  once there that was the terror of
it the men muttered as they worked
old talut chief paddler shook his head

gravely karlak flew at the business in
hand with furious energy but ming chu
read his face aright

  what is it  she asked what is so
wrong

  us karlak laughed bitterly he
swejt a hand toward the pitifully few
weapons piled on the sand spears and
knives can we hope to fight those
warriors a dozen of us  no the only
chance lies in the size of our ship

  and the way it handles said she
i know it beneficent dragon i can
handle it let me have the steering-oar
with one man to help you give the or-
ders

  he nodded and went back to work

  already her chest was aboard with her
gods and the bundle beside them the
ships original decking though sadly in
need of repair was good enough for their
purpose with the masts stepped the
rigging and sails in place all was ready
a little past noon but the man sent to
watch from the trees brought in bad
news the two giant proas outrigger
craft were close

  lets go  ordered karlak ill look
to the sails-you to the helm ming
chu

  the passage through the reef was easy
to see with the sun overhead and be-
hind there was a steady wind as the
sails bellied out and the ship moved
karlak uttered a wild cry of exultant joy
and his men echoed it a screaming
snarl broke from talut in the bows he
pointed and as the reef opened up and
they stood out the two proas appeared
racing down one glance told karlak
that they had the legs of him

  all hands for quick work  blared
his voice hard alee there quick
with it woman

  ming chu and the man with her put
the helm hard over the ship swung
into the wind hung for an instant with
her sails booming then filled smartly
away on the larboard tack one huge
proa not unlike the vinta of later days
with a great spread of sail and another
canoe smaller but crowded with men
under paddles alone karlak sized up
matters swiftly and swung toward ming
chu

  head for the smaller one-smash
her he shouted

she waved her hand in assent a
tangle of cordage as something gave
way karlak leaped to help with the
work all well again and the ship hold-
ships and men



ing true a thrill went through karlak
at the feel of her at her resilient re-
sponse though without ballast she rode
high and light what he would do with
this ship if he lived

  they were two hundred yards from the
paddled proa drawing closer with each
moment the larger craft was behind
them tearing down at racing speed
conch-shells blowing and men yelling
closer and closer now-a yell from kar-
lak and the helm was swung as the
sheets were eased off the ship wore
sharply and plunged at the proa

  the stroke missed those paddlers
knew their business they avoided that
sweeping death by a yard and sent a hail
of arrows aboard the ship-then they
were astern and out of it with the larger
craft charging down past them over-
hauling the ship at-a rapid clip

karlak looked at this craft-its huge
spread of sail its enormous out-
rigger sweeping the combers its crowd
of men and he knew himself lost he
could not run he had not men enough
to fight she was coming up fast men
were standing ready with lines and grap-
nels talut touched his arm and spoke
grimly

  look at her steering-oars

  karlak nodded icol was there and
behind him the tiger yu and one of
the balinbing chieftains a line was
thrown and another arrows hailed in
upon the doomed men of the dusur
tribe three of them were down others
were wounded the two craft were side
by side the lines were fast-

  karlak leaped to cut the lines hacked
one free already half a dozen men were
clambering aboard his own men met
them hand to hand another line aft-
he darted to it and severed it then he
heard the twang of a bowstring and
looked up

  ming chu stood there a great curving
bow in her hand a long shaft notched
the string twanged again a frightful
yell burst from icol as the shaft went
through him the balinbing chieftain
was down ming chu loosed the twang-
ing string once more and the tiger yu
himself that bold adventurer plunged
forward among the pirates and was lost
to sight

  and the last line parted the huge
proa sheered away wildly amid yells of
dismay from her crew while aboard the

ship the few boarders were met with
spear and knife karlak found himself
with six men left alive and the ship
clear he leaped to the side of ming
chu she was shouting at him

  look with that outrigger shes
helpless if we take her to leeward-
for the love of the gods cried kar-
lak laughing excitedly havent you
done enough woman no let her
go weve only half a dozen men left-
weve beaten them off weve whipped
them your shafts have killed their lead-
ers-enough for this time my woman
enough until next time comes 

  her eyes widened upon him the bow
fell from her hands she caught at him
suddenly touched the long arrow that
was through his thigh

  oh beneficent dragon-youre hurt
youre wounded-

  old talut bloody but still sound came
darting to take over the helm and
grinned widely as the ship ran up the
dark waves toward home and the enemy
fell behind

  next time  he grunted aye and
next time well take toll of those devils 
next time indeed and for many a year
to come and across the purple seas to
borneo and celebes on to the far moun-
tains of asia-the sturdy resilient ships
of the islanders took toll for many a cen-
tury and more

as we sat there by the dying fire kar-
lak told me how this toll was taken
of yellow man dyak white man then
his head lowered and through the shud-
dering booming of the surf his voice was
all but hushed

  and now the old days are gone he
said and we of these islands are no
longer americans we have our own gov-
ernment our own republic-hai by
allah we shall see about that there
is nothing but trouble and fear and war
to seek from the future the old days
are best the old days are ever the
best-

  myers of the constabulary looked at
me and wrinkled up his nose in a gri-
mace

  anyhow he said awkwardly thats
one hell of a good yarn of the old days
karlak and the first stitched ship was
that chap your ancestor

  karlak lifted his head my name
speaks he said with dignity and we
had our answer

the next colorful story of ships and men takes us to the waters
of the nile and the strange craft that built the pyramids

the story thus far

the future of all western
america hung in the balance
in the northwest the great
hudsons bay company was
pressing on with new outposts
in tlje southwest a great gathering of the
indian tribes threatened an alliance and
a savage war that would drive the few
white trappers back to the mississippi

  not easily driven were these white

trappers howeverkit carson one of

their leaders left bents fort one night
and on the invitation of the hudsons
bay man shunan attended a great in-
dian council at their camp near by kit
had saved shunans beautiful half-breed
daughter marie known as go everywhere
woman from a fight at a fandango in
santa fe and she had been greatly taken
with him at the council kit learned
that the indians only awaited a curious
medicine-sign-the appearance of a
white beaver-to begin their uprising

  with his partners rube herring and
laforay kit spent the rest of the sea-
son trapping and one morning to his
intense surprise he found a white beaver
-an albino presumably-in his trap
he skinned the animal  and hid the pelt
in the middle of his bale but shortly
thereafter the blackfeet raided the camp
and stole the fur-bales after a swift
pursuit his partners bales were recovered
but kits-the white pelt within it-was
carried off and the fate of an empire
hung on that strange medicine token

  at the animal-trappers rendezvous on
the green river carson interviewed the
hudsons bay chief and he-captain
mckay-seeking to win carson to the

companys forces used his influence to
get kits stolen furs for him and only
after the bale had been delivered to kit
unopened did the indians learn that it
contained the sacred white skin  at
about this time shunan sought to run off
with singing bird an indian girl in
whom carson was interested and in the
fight which followed both were wounded
   and it was none other than the fa-
mous missionary explorer dr marcus
whitman who dressed kits wound

  recovering carson set out with his
comrades for the beaver grounds again
taking the coveted white pelt with him
a short time afterward however he was
captured by the pitiless blackfeet
as he lay bound in a lodge his young
comrade stephens was also brought in
captive

  the blackfeet sent stephens to the
trappers camp with an offer to trade the
captive carson for the coveted white
beaver pelt otherwise carson would die
at the stake at the last moment bridger
and other trappers appeared with the
white fur the exchange was made and
carson released only as the trappers
whirled their horses and rode hard for
their fortified winter camp did the
blackfeet discover they had been tricked
by an ordinary pelt whitened with lime
dust

  the indians attacked the camp and
were beaten off-sought to burn the
trappers out and were defeated again
but though the blackfeet now disap-
peared carson and bridger knew they
would soon strike again the story
continues in detail

a great chapter in the winning of the west

cjfilght kjt

 by gordon keyne

more weeks had passed weeks of
blizzard of frozen snowy loneli-
ness of work of winter indeed winter
was of short remaining life

  the winter camp sat securely upon the
bottoms along the right bank of the
yellowstone an acre-square huddle of
smoking lodges and huts defended by
breastwork of logs and poles across the
frozen river extended the snowy plains
almost level until interrupted by gravel
hills and clay badlands

  in the camp bend of the river a curv-
ing bluff shut off the coldest wind up-
stream above the camp the groves of
sweet cottonwood were source of fuel
meat and fodder buffalo and elk ranged
there for shelter and the scanty crop-
pings of underbrush and coarse grass it
was simple to pack inboughs and bark to
the pole horse-pen for the greedy ani-
mals

  and all winter as yet no sign of ma-
rauding blackfeet the medicine skin
in the log storehouse which held packs
and supplies might have been as safe if
hung to a tree in the woods the look-
out daily posted in a shelter hut on the
bluff had cursed the monotonous useless
duty

  looks as though the varmints aint so
keen on getting the medicine skin after
all bridger declared one day come
trap season well take it to them

  no said laforay therell be the
red sky

  plenty red skies already morning
-evening free choice

  not that kind a sky all blood in
the night i see it same as their medi-

cine man i see heap blackfeet march-
ing through the sky jim and last night
i see an eagle flying off with the pelt in
his claws the blackfeet make ready
for one big try they wait for the medi-
cine to say when

  the swart wrinkled face of laforay as
he sat in the lodge was sweating with
earnestness bridger retorted with his
wonted soundless chuckle

  if youd et a few more pounds buff-
ler meat youd ha dreamed of that pelt
turned back to beaver and setting on
your stomach he picked up his rifle
and rose im off to see bout reynolds
allowed hes feeling poorly

  bridger went out laforay glanced at
carson intently

  i feel a big fight kit for sure
plenty dead not you not me not rube
but others some of us i guess plenty
blackfeet i see smoke a trail where
women cry with their hair down same
as stephens mother something tell me
i feel better when i have the hair of shu-
nans daughter and you have plenty ea-
gles hair

  i aim to have that-and the rapahoe
girl to boot carson said slowly ill do
it sure as beaver comes to baited trap
we have early spring-and laforay
nodded sagely already long winter
yesterday i see where bear poke himself
out of hole on south side of hill bust
open rotten log and eat grubs then go
back for more sleep he hungry he
know next time he stay out

  presently bridger came in again his
seamed features dark

  ive put reynolds in the hide leanto

                                                            it txs

  the signal gun of the lookout had
sounded and men were breaking into
shouts carson bridger and laforay ran
out of the lodge the lookout was call-
ing and pointing upriver in a moment
everyone could see the cause-a single
horseman riding hard

  rounding into the wooded bend the
rider came on like a courier bearing full
tilt down the snowy ice of the yellow-
stone as though the devil lashed his ani-
mals rump a large man constantly
glancing over his shoulder

  hell-bent from the blackfeet-with
his guts cold rasped rube herring

 white man by damn the big
frenchie cried laforay

  shunan indeed as flying red hair and
beard testified he swerved in for the
camp and in front of the camp entrance
hauled his sweated mount short chill-
ing eyes met him-astonished hostile

offn the stores where the fleshing-block
is pears to me hes coming down with
the measles

  carson glanced up what howd
he get em 

  bridger squatted there was an old
injun camp place back in the woods and
a sioux carcass up in a tree i told him
it was bad medicine to meddle with but
he thought he seen a good blanket and
dumb up and got it found it was rat-
gnawed and threw it away like as not
ketched the measles offn it he can stay
in that leanto until hes well ill tend
on him

  bad medicine sure to bother grave
said laforay you watch out jim

ing and pass in his soup    hark
bridger started up whats doing
non yoji must not shoot burst fortli shunan i have something to say-

lifes a fight kit

and carsons blue eyes rested icil on
that flaming countenance

  leave your hoss well talk in my
lodge said bridger ungraciously that
is if theres air enough with you there

  shunan swung off they walked to
bridgers lodge entered and sat down
outside the camp was in a murmur

bridgers squaw tossed dry cottonwood
on the fire and scuttled away

 we pass the pipe and sit like
friends said shunan

  nope the pipe is cold bridger
rapped out if you got a talk to warm
it ears are open else go back fast as
you come

  i cant go back i come from the
blackfeet i come fast because arrows
are faster by gar there is death jn the
woods you see me take to the river
-and shunan shivered as he gripped
the fusil across his lap i struck plenty
eagle in the face some day i take his
scalp now i claim refuge here hein
from what im not sure what but
im safe here when you march shunan
will help you fight plenty eagle

	the blue book magazine

  why didnt you stay at fort hall

  mats out i went there three time

let two time by arrow i think maybe

so i never come back for the leetle
squaw so i go back by short trail to
get that rapahoe squaw plenty eagle
he laugh at me he keep her himself
he say his sister wife enough for me so
i see my daughter

while listening to the rapid burst
of words carson sniffed the air
his blue eyes lit up then shunan was
talking again swiftly earnestly

  she tell me plenty eagle act accord-
ing as his medicine say he is great
man greater than hudsons bay man
the rapahoe girl will make him strong
i stay there but every time i go out for
hunt my hair feel loose two time ar-
rows fly with song of death by gar i
get mad i tell plenty eagle hes be one
bad-heart liar and hit him he would
kill a hudsons bay man  not shunan

blanket by gar i change camp i sit
up outside the fire at daylight i hear a
leetle snap i jump for my hoss an ar-
row whistle through my hair i ride like
hell from the next bow-twang i ask
refuge from the head chief here you
msieu bridger i stay where those
blackfeet will not come on me like wolf
in snow i will march with you as
brother

  like hell said bridger disgustedly
a tall yarn dont believe a word of it
shunan what you come for huh 

  carson his eyes alight rose and
slipped out when he came back shu-
nan was talking excitedly passionately

  i not know nothing about medicine
skin let plenty eagle find it hein
his medicine tell him to wait the medi-
cine wait for him on the yellowstone for
a red sky that has drunk up the snow
msieu i show you my heart my
tongue is straight

  carson whipped his hand from behind
him and held out the fox-fur cap he
threw a glance down at the broad moc-
casins

  your cap shunan and your tracks
in the snow back by that island winter
camp it was you who shot at me that
day-

  he checked himself abruptly his
thoughts went back to those other tracks
in the snow which laforay had de-
clared to be arapahoe he caught his
breath his eyes widened but shunan
was panting out hot words eager ex-
cuses

  shes be my cap sure why i tell
you i shoot at you put no bullet on
top the powder a warrior see me get
angry we fight i lose my cap yes i
run with everybody and i go back and
have trouble with plenty eagle

  hell a pack of lies carson threw
down the cap the bonnets like your
talk shunan lousy

  listen i am white man same as
you shunan made desperate appeal to
bridger you put me out what hap-
pen plenty eagle smoke my scalp
my ghost follow you im be dead but
no matter my ghost follow you all the
same my spirit say to you one white
man let another white man be killed
carson sniffed but jim bridger shift-
ed about uneasily rubbed his jaw med-
itated at length he voiced decision

  mebbe true mebbe not you can
stay keep to camp and you keep your
hair try any tricks you lose it dun-
no but what id rather have you under
my eye than ranging loose on fetch and
call between the hudsons bay and the
blackfeet

  shunans hazel eyes bloodshot from
snow and wind darted to carson but
carson made no comment with a
shrug shunan turned to bridger

  you give me sanctuary bon let
us smoke it

bridger called for a pipe his
squaw ducked in and found the pipe
with long reed stem and green stone
bowl she filled it with kinnikinnick the
mixture of tobacco and red willow and
laid a coal to it bridger took it puffed
a gulp of smoke from mouth and nose
and passed the pipe to shunan the lat-
ter puffed and extended the pipe to car-
son but carson refused it

  it is poison

  no matter shunan was slyly jubi-
lant the chief and i have smoked
you can see to your animal bridger
said and stood up therell be quarters
for you somewhere long as you keep to
camp

  sacre nom  shunan shook his huge
head ruefully i will not be caught
again in the woods i dont fight what i
not see
lifes a fight kit	

  carson spoke deliberately i cant
touch you in camp but the first minute
i find you outside ill kill you

 non non in camp we shall be
friends and shunan gave him a malev-
olent grin when we march together
to strike the blackfeet you shall have
plenty eagles scalp and ill take the
leelle squaw hein

  astounded at the mans insolence car-
son kept himself in hand

  youll never get that rapahoe girl
to woman you he said with contempt

  i choose not to hear big talk-and
shunan laughed some one tell me the
rapahoe are mad with us both good
you are good leetle man but i am
shunan of hudsons bay i give her
father those twenty hosses hein i give
you plenty eagles scalp to buy her sister
with maybe

carson rose and shunan they
went outside all three and paused
shunan spoke as by careless thought

  you have the medicine skin safe
bridger

  sartin sartin said bridger and
jerked his head in that storehouse
over there safe from varmints door
has no lock the bar is lead-and he
tapped his rifle

  whats that smoke in the leanto
shunan asked carson was trying vain-
ly to catch bridgers eye and warn him
to check his tongue

  a sick man keep away from there
or youll catch the itch

  bah i am not afraid said shunan
i am good nurse me i will tend him
to show my good heart you have brim-
stone or powder will do

  not by a damn sight bridger
warned you keep clear of storehouse
and leanto or youll get an itch itll take
hells brimstun to cure that thereis
medicine ground fust man ketches you
violating medicine will flash a ball
through you while youre here-and
bridgers stubble and fringe of whiskers
twitched with a flitting smile-carson
will look after you

  bon  understood   exclaimed -hu-
nan kit and i will sleep under one
blanket

  he strode away to look after his horse
carson turned hotly to jim bridger

  ill not share the same lodge with that
dog

  that talk dont shine-and bridg-
er chuckled youre elected cause i
know you wont sleep at all or else

hell have that rapahoe gal fore you
can get to her

  carson frowned jim what are you
up to what dyou mean

  hell aint you up to trap i told
him his tongue was forked its all plain
as fresh beaver sign let him get that
medicine pelt in his hands and pass it to
plenty eagle and the gal is his thats
the bargain you bet

  i dont read your float-stick you
told him where the pelt is kept
pshaw bridgers tone was impa-
tient but his lean leathery countenance
twitched again with sly good humor i
opened the road to him sure he come
here with a pack o lies about death on
his trail now well know where to be
looking if he wants the medicine hell
go after it your job kit keep your
rifle primed

  and chuckling anew shrewd old bridg-
er went about his business

  the day passed the night another
day shunan idled about the camp and
boasted with thinly veiled insolence he
slyly taunted carson secure of his ground
now that bridger had smoked and made
the camp safe for him carson watched
him and slept ill ridden by fear lest he
lose a chance to put a bullet into the
vaunter meantime reynolds grew no
better but worse measles said bridg-
er and took all care of the sick man him-
self

  a prime buffalo hunt that day with
meat piled high and the feast unending
pots simmered with blood and marrow
spitted strips of fat hump had sizzled
over the coals sausages of spiraled guts
well stuffed had browned crisp and juicy
the camp gorged late gorged to reple-
tion all hands turned in to sleep like
holed bears no guards were out there
was no thought of peril the blackfeet
camps were long marches away shunan
had declared besides the medicine sign
was a red sky over bared earth while
now all the world was whitely frozen

dozing carson stirred slept again
roused he was conscious of la-
forays snores of herrings nosy blasts
of shunans puffy drone awhistle through
his beard each man had his note

  again carson stirred daybreak  no
it was the paler gray of full morning
now mustering for the sunrise the
lodge was draped in heavy silence men
slept exhausted blanketed in the last-
hour sleep which would postpone the day
carsons attention quickened he sat

up stared for him the lodge was emp-
ty  shunan had gone

  a leap and carson was up reaching
for hunting-shirt and moccasins he
seized rifle and fixings and slid out-
side avid for the chance should shu-
nan take one step outside the bounds
carson would be free to put lead into
him-but not until then

  the entire camp was inert grossly
slumbering ah there was the shaggy
bulk at the entrance of the leanto just
emerging gone to see the sick man
not likely carsons heart leaped the

herring was down a figure
was charging in like a
cougar plenty eagle-his
hatchet up for the coup

connecting door from leanto into the
storehouse the white beaver pelt shu-
nan had been after that medicine skin
had stolen it-

  sudden and swift shunan burst from
the leanto like a buffalo bull with tail
up he plied legs and moccasins for the
horse-pen running like a madman with
long bounds he jumped the top rail
the pen was a confusion of rearing snort-
ing animals suddenly startled shunan
emerged from the welter already astride
even as carson broke into a run he
vaulted the rail and was away hammer-
ing with his heels and next instant his
horse rose to the breastwork barrier
lifes a fight kit	

  carson calculated as he ran per-
chance waste his shot at that mark with
no time to reload no better make
sure must make sure shunan had
stolen the pelt and was off with it no
miss no failure else the mountains and
the plains were red with blood

  once in the pen carson nabbed the
best horse to hand vaulted astride was
over the rail and after through the hiss
of air in his ears he heard the blether of
the alarmed and wakening camp his
mount took the barricade and landed in
the very tracks of shunans mount the
course lay straight across the snow of
the icy river and on into the plain and
the low hills and brush-dark valleys
with the badlands beyond

  shunan two rifle-shots in the lead
looked to the rear bent forward lifted
his horse into full speed with his heels
drumming in the cold gray morning
his objective was clear the first bad-
lands offered him sure refuge one of the
puzzling clay arroyos or deep and crook-
ed washes where a fugitive could twist
and turn like a cunning rabbit and on
far beyond in the better country ahead
the blackfeet

if the race were to the swift shunan
had no chance carson rode upon
thudding hoofs the breeze lashed his
eyes set them watering set him cursing
for fear of blurred sights when the time
came but his horse had better legs than
the other the interval between rabbit
and hound was slowly lessening shunan
bulked larger by his motions he was
renewing the priming of his fusil

  the first spring was run the miles
flowed behind and now it was a matter
of bottom no less than of speed twice
carson was tempted once he lifted rifle
butt to shoulder but a shot at a gallop
was uncertain the range was long he
must make certain bring the rascal to a
stand and kill him

  across the plain now at the low hills
the end in sight desperate frantic
shunan sent his horse plunging at an
opening draw carson could hear the
spatter of the snowy gravel as he tore
after up the winding draw he had
glimpse of man and horse he cocked his
rifle

  the draw narrowed any instant now
another curve carson rounded it and
saw how the draw ended in a high cut
bank shunans horse was slipping and
floundering on the steep slope to the
right the animal came to its knees

  shunan turned and his fusil came up
carson jerked his mount about and
through the smoke-gush of his own dis-
charge saw the fusil vomit forth the
ball whistled past him then shunan was
squirming in the snow his fusil sticking
out of a drift his horse wildly scrambling
away the two reports almost merging
volleyed in dull echoes

  carson reloaded the job must be fin-
ished shunan staggered up then sank
down again clinging to the reins one
hand pressed to reddening left shoulder
carson drew in rifle ready

  non i you must not shoot burst
forth shunan eyes desperate one mo-
ment  i give you the rapahoe squaw
i have something to say-

  say it to the wolves im taking the
medicine pelt back to camp carson
brought up his rifle clapped priming into
pan cocked the piece and slipped to the
ground his intent was plain shunans
blanched face was terrible to see

 non you shall hear me i have
something to tell for you to tell bridger
tell all kill me and you not know till
too late cried shunan in a frenzy i
dont touch the pelt i tell you my
breast is bare to your bullet i cannot
fight listen to me-

  carsons gaze was blue ice all right
ill take you back to bridger if you say
the word you know what thatll
mean-

  i will not go screamed shunan it
is one camp of death you shall hear
what i have to say why did i run like
hell  that is one pelt of death to you
all in camp damn you shoot-i defy
you all are dead man you and the
rest my ghost will laugh-

  the man was in frightful earnest car-
son despite himself hesitated and won-
dered

  then the eyes of shunan widened
fixed and staring his jaw fell his mouth
hung open with no word issuing there
was a sharp hiss a dull twang- spatt 
the arrow singing past carsons ear had
sunk to its feathers in shunans breast
it drove the air from the lungs in a chok-
ing gasp drove the body backward

carson had only half turned to the
twang and the exultant whoop when
a figure came bounding down the slope
recognition snapped through him it was
the young arapahoe brave the lover of
singing bird carson remembered every-
thing-those mysterious tracks in the
snow the arrows shunan had blamed on


the blue book magazine

lurking blackfeet all the while brave
elk had been on the vengeance trail

  charging onto the dead man brave
elk struck the staring face with his bow
coup he bent over slashed with his
knife stood erect with the red scalp in
his hand and held it high his yell
echoed through the draw

  it is mine he shouted challenge at
carson you wounded him but i killed
him i reached him first i counted coup
we wont quarrel over the hair car-
son said grimly but i claim whats
under his shirt i take that you take
the rest or else- and his rifle moved
slightly

brave elk laughed jubilantly the
trophy thus assured him in his ex-
ultation enmity for carson was swept
away

  you can have what is under his shirt
the rest is mine

  the elk stooped parted the folds of
shunans shirt and explored he straight-
ened up and kicked the dead thing in
contempt

  only a dirty skin you are welcome
to it

  carson stared incredulous  it was
true no white beaver pelt-nothing
then what did shunans mad flight mean 
what had his words about death meant 

  brave elk stripped away powder-horn
and pouch and beaded belt and weapons
left the jutting arrow as his sign and
darted back to retrieve the fusil he cast
a look at the horse which had come to a
halt in the draw below and spoke

  now i have killed him i have been
a long time trying

  true the elk was gaunt and weath-
ered and worn his buckskin patched and
tattered he leaned on shunans fusil as
though suddenly very weary

  i have been a wolf living in holes the
red dog hid on the snake my medicine
was bad i followed him to the black-
feet lodges and watched for him my
medicine was bad again i almost killed
him in the woods on the yellowstone he
was afraid he ran away to you to the
americans i watched the plains in front
of the fort but he did not come out into
the woods my eyes were bright with
hate this morning i saw him chased
across under the open sky i ran hard to
be first the shots brought me here
now i am a man again i will go to
sights the enemy with what i have
taken and ask him for singing bird
carson started

  singing bird then she is back home

again

  i do not know said brave elk i
did not go into plenty eagles village
when i watched for sun buffalo the
hearts of the arapahoe are bad toward
the blackfeet the arapahoe will not talk
with him until he returns singing bird
they will listen only to the great medi-
cine the sign from the great spirit
why did you ask me to look under the
shirt of this dead dog

  because we have the great medicine
i trapped it myself carson said i
thought shunan had stolen it and was
running to the blackfeet

  brave elk regarded him frowningly
curiously and shook his head

  no what you have is not the medi-
cine little chief the medicine is not
in this country the white beaver
medicine crosses the mountains from the
sunrise side when the grass is green and
the buffalo calves

  why do you say that brave elk
it is what the flatheads say what the
nez perces say they look for the white
beaver to come through the mountains
by that pass you call south pass it is
the true strong medicine for the side
that keeps it that is the sign the
medicine you have is false

  carson anxious to keep the young war-
rior in talk spoke with subtle flattery

  brave elk is very cunning he has
counted a great cotip the scalp of sun
buffalo will be a trophy for his children
to admire he has watched well he will
have a new name keen watcher he sees
afar the blackfeet will talk of how
he killed sun buffalo in their country
the haggard young brave glowed with
pride

  little chief had better go home the
blackfeet are coming like leaves rolling
in the wind of autumn

  no they are far from here

  two days ago i was hunting in the
hills before sunrise blackfeet caught
me i had no horse i was tired they
left my knife my bow and one arrow
and sent me home to tell the arapahoe
that in another moon the medicine skin
would be passed for war the black-
feet were on their way to the yellow-
stone to wipe out you and the blanket
chief and your men

  and you believed such a story
scoffed carson hiding his swift alarm at
this news

  i believe my own eyes i saw far off
a camp of blackfeet too many to count
lifes a fight kit



plenty eagle was waiting for his medi-
cine to tell him to march he is not far
he can strike in one days march the
elks tone was positive he spoke truth
my one arrow was enough now i can
go home rich with scalp and horse and
gun i am going

  carson mounted brave elk bestrode
shunans horse with all his plunder and
now paused for one last word

  when singing bird sees the red scalp
she will be glad i promised it to her
you talked big but you have done noth-
ing the americans are no good if the
blackfeet take that skin you claim to
have and it makes them strong then
the arapahoe will not wait for the other
white beaver medicine that crosses the
mountains they will make war at once
away went brave elk

  carson turned homeward and rode at
his best pace toward the camp across the
yellowstone he was thoughtful per-
plexed the sun was up and flared curi-
ously yellow in a haze that tinged all the
sky with a mustard saffron the breeze
was from the southwest but now and
again it struck his right cheek with
changing puffy gusts from the west
warm upon the skin it meant a thaw

  what had shunan been trying to say
when that arrow stilled him perhaps
he had known the blackfeet were on the
move but what had made him pull out
in such a tearing hurry 

  news now for bridger brave elk
had spoken as with truth the blackfeet
were coming and brave elk would go
on to claim singing bird well there re-
mained plenty eagle and his black hair
to be taken and shunans daughter
somewhere with laforays claim upon
her lovely scalp

  carson frowned what the flatheads
and nez perces in the northwest meant
by their rigmarole about the great white
beaver medicine coming this next spring
from the sunrise was a puzzle the air
was getting full of medicine talk medi-
cine sign but if the blackfeet got hold
pf this white pelt the sign would be hell
and they were coming to get it

chapter xv

all day the company had been busy
 adding to the breastworks bridger
took with utmost seriousness the warn-
ing carson had conveyed to him

  stout pieces of cut timber were leaned
against jhe ramparts from the inside un-

til a rude palisade surrounded the camp
the lookout on the bluff kept sharp eye
on the horizon across the plain on the
river curve around the leafless woods

  with mid-morning the wind had set
strongly from the west at first chilled
then with increasing tepid warmth until
by noon the men thick-blooded from the
long cold worked with leather hunting-
shirts flung aside and under-shirts open
at the throat there was little sweat
the rushing air was thirsty curiously dry
it sapped the moisture from the skin

  laforay paused in wrestling with a log
and straightened up to wheeze the
wind blew his long black hair clear of
his shoulders as he gazed about from
parched wrinkled face

  by damn plenty bad sign kit
medicine at work sure those devil
blackfeet come under red sky now and
we fignt for our hair

  carson laughed weve had plenty
red skies and they havent come the
word of brave elk beats dreams well
likely be swapping lead tomorrow
theyre holding off mebbe account of
this wind put in rube herring lead
cant score true arrers cant fly in a cross
wind like this but somethings doing

i	itch worsern reynolds with the mea-
sles and hes right bad accordin to
bridger

  tomorrow sure croaked laforay
they come under red sky over ground
bare of winter their medicine say so i
see red sky you bet not sunset sunrise
but low sky above red like blood i not
see that bare ground of winter but i see
him all bare by morning this medicine
wind eat the snow like hungry buffalo
herd eat the grass look  already the
snow she go

  skin me for a beaver if it aint so
exclaimed herring this here wind is
hot dry from the bellers of hell its
suckin up the snow like i suck marrow
outn a cracked bone if the blackfeet
leave us our hair well be settin traps
afore the weeks out

  carsons own hide itched and his cheeks
burned as though scalded he like the
rest worked irritably cursing with dry
tongue and blinking with shriveled lids
and hot eyes he bestowed little thought
upon reynolds in the leanto except to
hope this gale would blow the measles
out of camp and so bring some good

  by the time the sun sank in that yellow
west from which the furious air belched
large tracts of soil lay bare around the
white scars of lessening drifts the wind


the blue book magazine

blew on through a strange brassy twi-
light gustily warm yet bleak with arid
harshness the horses milled and fretted
in their pen restless with thirst and the
whistling air

silence descended with the night
the wearied camp slept    carson
was brought from sleep by an alarm a
shout another he sprang up  the lodge
was emptying in a flurry of robes as men
grabbed their arms and bolted he fol-
lowed at laforays heels to stand in
sheer amazement

 the sky above was murky but the
night was singularly thin and drenched
with a ruddy glow from the north mount-
ing and flaming across the heavens so
that earth and stark faces and trees were
flooded with the crimson of blood ranged
along the defenses men peered and
pointed in a buzz of wonder

  the northern lights flamed higher in
a weaving shuttle of crimson the air
was still knife cold brittle dry carson
prickled every nerve was taut as a
notched bowstring and when he brushed
his hair aside with sweep of palm it
crackled with sparks the horses redly
illumined were snorting and trampling
tossing uneasy heads

  by gawd the worlds afire yapped
somebody its kingdom come

  its blackfeet come shrilled lafo-
ray bloody sky bare ground-it is the
sign now they come 

 look went up a shout hells
opened laforays right

  the plain across the river was bathed
in reflected crimson the uplifts of its
farther edge stood out against the waver-
ing horizon from the northwest quar-
ter a black torrent moved down spread-
ing into the plain blackfeet-a host

  the torrent flowed on marching
spreading men muttered locks clicked
it was not far from dawn the wavering
glow was fading the plain dulling to a
faintly lurid dusk men drew breath
bridgers voice lifted

  shows over they aint got sand for
a night scrap and ghost-trail in the dark
theyve halted

  not for long jim the dream say not
spoke up laforay morning will be the
big fight better stay ready listen
they dance medicine

  fires began to glimmer across the re-
turning gloom four in all as bridger
summed them the bloods piegans and
blackfeet of the last-named confederacy
with their allies the gros vents the
faint wild bedlam of medicine and war
dance drifted down by snatches across
the stillness

  one of the fires was moved forward
far forward-almost within rifle-shot
the whistle of plenty eagle was heard
now and again here and at the other

dont tech it dend buck in it-died
   smallpox by god ill not take
   this trail death trail shre
lifes a fight kit



fires the redskins were bunched now
and again a rifle was discharged the
chorused yells came clearly across the
snow-patched earth

  the men were all crowded at the
breastworks watching listening expect-
ing attack at any moment even bridger
was puzzled by the goings-on twice a
mass of mounted blackfeet came surging
forward only to fall back again before
coming within shot

  all hands watching waiting were on
hair-triggers the men shifted place
spat murmured with dry lips those
crimson lights the medicine talk the red
sky rendered them all uneasy two men
were on guard along the rear of the camp
a needless precaution here was all the
menace out here in front

  the dawn began to lighten the fires
winked down the turmoil quieted out
across the plain grew a vast silence as the
day neared carson standing by himself
and watching swung around as bridger
stalked up to him

  what dye make of it kit

  looks queer said carson

  aint in nature injun nature for them
to front us in a scrap growled bridger
no circling around settin thar like
sojers-huh  aint reasonable

  carson grunted assent if plenty eagle
meant to attack in the face of those rifles
which was almost incredible he would
have had the entire camp surrounded
by warriors long ere this if he did not
mean attack he would lose face with his
own warriors it was a puzzle

vyhos watching the river car-
  w son asked suddenly

  smith and herndon lets take a
prowl

  carson moved off with him it was
hard to take their eyes from the black
masses out there in front threatening at-
tack at any moment they circled the
breastworks here with an occasional
word to the intent tense men came
around to the horse camp moved back to
the side fronting the yellowstone little
	the blue book magazine

danger to be apprehended here along the
river bend while the entire enemy force
was out there in front yet as carson
realized this very fact was strange a
burst of rifle-shots brought both men
around in stiffening alertness another
false alarm they passed on

  hey herndon  bridger called out
everything quiet here

  no answer beyond the breastwork
the ground stretched snow-dotted to the
frozen river even in the dawn-darkness
the patches of snow could be seen

  a grunt broke from bridger carson
leaped forward beside him to where the
dark shape of herndon leaned over the
log defense at bridgers touch the fig-
ure slipped sideways with an astounded
oath bridger straightened up

  dead and scalped  smith consarn
it where are ye

smith too-knifed scalped already
stiffening no one was in sight no
indians were near here suddenly car-
son vaulted the logs

  here jim  look at this 

  a snow patch that was not a snow
patch a buffalo robe heaped and cov-
ered with snow now fallen aside clear
enough at a glimpse what had happened
covered by this robe and snow simulat-
ing one of the snow patches moving for-
ward by feet and inches an indian then
to rise suddenly and bury knife in guard

  they were in aint in now grunted
bridger plenty eagle raised that hell
out yonder to cover em here wait a
minute-

  carson waited not but followed as
bridger leaped away followed to the
back of the hide leanto where reynolds
lay there was a long slash in the hide
no sound came from within bridger
paused grimly

  they opened the way for his ghost
thanks for the trouble

  what do you mean they killed
reynolds 

  nope he passed out during the
night i aint told nobody yet no use
looking now no time to talk they
snuck in got the pelt and went its
gone-

  a wild thrilling chorus of yells pealed
up and up from the blackfoot host it
was caught up by the mountain men
yells for bridger arose with one curt
warning to keep a close mouth bridger
dashed away carson glanced at the
leanto then went after the pelt gone
how did bridger know

  no time to think of that now the
daylight was mounting the sky overhead
was slightly hazed the blackfeet were
in turmoil whooping in wild exultation
carson saw half a dozen trappers loping
back to watch the river side he like
the others stared at the sky

  theeastern horizon was banded with
rose deepening momentarily that to
the north was veiled by a turbid pall
hanging like a curtain the rays of the
yet unseen sun reflected on this suspend-
ed dust in the air were turning the pall to
scarlet exclamations of wonder of awed
alarm ran along the breastworks now
it was a thicker redness like a sodden
bloody blanket hung above the indian
host

  by damn thats the sign   blared la-
forays staccato just as i dream 
bridger cursed such talk the bloods
over their heads not ourn

  hey theyre a-coming went up
sharp yelps look out all hands

  so it seemed the host was moving
the other clans had come up to the
blackfoot array they had dismounted
and were moving forward afoot plenty
eagle was now in clear sight to carsons
eager eye they came on under that red
sky over the bare ground of winter
they spread out came forward like a
wave drew back again the whistle of
plenty eagle shrilling

  hold tight yelled bridger stay
put everybody

  carson cautioned the men around him
no battle here unless the whites could
be tempted out into the open war
drums were rattling and tapping whoops
blaring in a confused medley rifles and
muskets were banging away until a white
pall of smoke overhung the entire host
a few of the men made reply not many

  if they come on let em come  shout-
ed somebody in frenzy of suspense give
em green river  

  grips and green river pealed up
the answering yells skinning-knives
stamped with gr-george rex said
some green river said others

carsons blood quieted no green
river today no blackfeet when
the powder-smoke thinned the host was
seen drawing away mounting flooding
back whence they had come yells of
whooping derision burst forth one and
all the men demanded to mount and ride
pursue fight

  but carson watching those warriors
retire knew the truth his heart sank as
lifes a fight kit

dismay and consternation laid hold upon
him with a cold grip the white beaver
was gone

  as yet it was not known to others
the death of herndon and smith was
known the men were in a fury but even
the hottest spirits knew the folly of rid-
ing after that redskin host carsons
gaze followed the last of them as they
drifted away in the full daylight

then bridger was coming beckoning
him in silence all danger past fires
were being built up and a meal prepared
the two went back to the slashed leanto

  well go in the way his ghost went
out said bridger grimly pulling the
hide aside come on make sure i
pulled the blanket up over his face last
night-

  carson came in looked and looked
away no blanket at all now the dead
man had been scalped then looking
again carson suddenly froze at sight of
spotted face and chest he caught bridg-
ets arm

  measles  not by a damn sight jim
smallpox 

  i suspicioned it said bridger calmly
how dye know

  i nursed bent once he had it bad
the men at his fort the cheyennes the
rapahoes all had it

  and reynolds ketched it from that
infernal sioux blanket

  but the beaver pelt carson forced
the words where is it  how-
listen after shunan lit out i
thought hed hooked it nope i found
reynolds layin in a stew and muttering
had the white pelt in his hands

  who gave it to him

  hell he took it his medicine made
him do it i tossed it back into a corner
of the storehouse when i found him last
night hed got it again dying mans
medicine aint to be gainsaid i aimed to
smoke out the sickness from it later the
varmint who scalped him got it and run
off now what do you figger kit

  in those shrewd eyes carson read a
deathly message from which he shrank

  shunan looked in saw reynolds
bedded with the pelt recognized small-
pox and ran like hell thats what he
was trying to tell me

  yep he run to warn plenty eagle
the trail o that pelts a death trail let
it go come spring there wont be no
more crowded blackfoot lodges you
aint seen smallpox hit in prime territory
kit itll kill moren bullets but dont

  tell the men theyd make tracks out of
here were in no shape to travel we
got to slide reynolds under the ice with-
out anybody seeing him dast you tech
him

  carson grunted told you once id
not stand back from the smallpox
together they wrapped up the dead
man a grisly task nobody outside re-
garded them as they went forth with the
burden and on down to the river they
slipped it into an air-hole the camp
was abuzz with talk with eating with
loud vaunting carson once off the ice
turned and met the gaze of bridger

  well jim you and me thinking the
same thing

  bridger scowled dont be a damn
fool kit it aint our doins i dont
savvy all this different medicine talk
some tribes claim the white beaver comes
later some say the blackfeet-

  hold on jim carson said steadily
dont hide the trail do we go out
wont do no good they wont be-
lieve us

  no matter we got to tell em im
leaving soon enough on my own business

i	aim to have my grip in the eagles top
feathers but-

  bridger stood silent for a moment
scowling then made the sign that the
talk was ended and turned

half an hour later they rode out
twenty men riding after them la-
foray rube herring and two others rode
out also each party to contact redskins
if possible and seek a parley bridger
evaded curious questions with specious
excuses that allayed curiosity

  carson always remembered that ride
with a little shrinking horror as one re-
members what might have been but was
not

  no word came from rube herrings
party their own outfit later in the day
sighted blackfeet or more correctly a
hunting party of piegans the peace
sign bridger and carson riding forth
alone gradually quieted suspicion and a
chief came out to meet them while his
warriors took cover somehow carson
felt as though the desperate earnest of
them both had impelled that chief for-
ward as though their own frantic inward
urge had brought him to quiet their very
souls

  they talked by sign and word they
warned of the smallpox they told what
had taken place carson abandoned dig-
nity and gained only cold contempt
	the blue book magazine

the piegan chief regarded them listened
and his eyes glittered at them in derision

  you are children he made response
you are women your tongues are
forked you come with lies because the
white beaver medicine is ours go back
to your lodges and wait until we come to
take your scalps and give you to our
women for torment

  and making the talk ended sign he
turned and rode away

  satisfied asked bridger grimly
carson shrugged and assented

  back in the fort again they came on
high talk and vociferous boasting rube
herring was back with his party boot-
less plenty eagle himself had jumped
them with a dozen warriors

  the four had fought off had ridden off
had somehow got clear

  i tell you brayed herring i seen
the bullet lift the sack on that varmints
chest hes lead proof dead sure
whats that carson came alert
you had a shot at plenty eagle

  as fair as ever i took at standing
buck kit i drawed fine and pulled-
with the bead centering his medicine
sack ill swear by the shirt-tail of
moses as my pappy used to say the sack
swung when the ball hit but the devil
just swung his hoss and rode off like noth-
ing had happened

  carson was in no mood to flatter the
others vanity

hell you flashed a rolling ball at
him spittle wont answer for patch and

rammer the leadll carry but it aint
got the bite you loaded too fast
theres your answer

  i knowed that when you were sucking
at your mammy roared herring angrily
i tell you the bullet struck the medicine
bag fair and square next time ill try
injun hide not medicine hide ill learn
how thick his gall covers him

  lead no good laforay cackled it
take bullet of horn or silver remember
twice i fire at him and he care no damn
well spoke up bridger well get a
chance at him agin when laforays bear
comes out to stay wont be long now
youll have your hands in his hair yet
kit

  im not waiting carson said in his
calm quiet way that brooked no protest
soon as i run off some bullets im after
him tomorrow im staying for noth-
ing and nobody

  his challenge met prompt answer
this same night the skies clouded
thickly by morning a blizzard was cov-
ering the vengeance trail wiping it from
sight and the bare trees moaning along
the river with hopes of spring deferred
sighed to angry men of patience

  but carson wondered whether had
plenty eagle stood in the moccasin of
that piegan chief the story of smallpox
might not have been credited he and
bridger made no further talk of the mat-
ter it was their own secret

chapter xvi

laforays bear had come out to stay
j the geese winged their travois wedg-
es across the high sky the willows were
growing supple the cottonwood buds
were swelling and the ice of the river
was rotting the brigade was ready
wounds had healed rapidly under bridg-
ers promise of action and the speeding
weather signs

  well march norwest for the heads
of the missouri bridger announced
if that dont draw the blackfeet from
cover then im a skunk well trap
the season out then swing down to fort
hall on the snake to refit with whats
needed and make for summer rendez-
vous on the green att suited

  carson who had stayed perforce only
shrugged the blackfeet had arrived
out of the northwest back they bad
gone with the medicine pelt into the
northwest somewhere in the northwest
they should be found strong in medicine
lifes a fight kit	

defying any trespass upon the hunting-
grounds they prized most highly

  strong in the white beaver medicine
carson had his suspicions as to that in
these few weeks no word of any kind
had come in the white beaver skin
would not be passed on until the trails
of the divide were open the blackfeet
had suffered losses they had what they
had come to get and would lick their
wounds ere seeking more

  what of singing bird still held as
hostage or returned to her people car-
son grew hot as he thought of plenty
eagle at the end of a shortened trail he
grew cold as he thought of the girl held
in a foul and wailing plague-swept vil-
lage only he and bridger knew the se-
cret of the medicine skin nor did any of
the men share the secret of the scalped
reynolds

they were off at last as the first of
the fresh beaver cuttings floated down
the streams and the hills greened set-
ting traps at evening lifting them in the
morning gleaning well by the way the
march pushed on to cross the higher
country and hunt the waters of the three
forks at the heads of the missouri

  and as they went no trace of black-
feet to carson and to bridger this
peace was ominous as herring opined
where injuns aint theyre sartin to be
most

  upon a day the advance party rode
well in the lead carson laforay her-
ring-twenty in all with rein loose and
rifle at ease eyes and ears on guard
abruptly laforay spoke out

  look out we have a fight my medi-
cine tell me i feel my knife stir in
sheath like baby in mother come sure
quick 

  they were riding up a gentle slope stud-
ded by boulders and dotted with pines
beyond the rock-strewn ridge ahead they
should get view of the promised land on
the right curving for the ridge was a
rampart line of sharply rising hills on
the left a terraced downward drop into
a canon where only a bird could find
footing thus led the pass	

  and now as though born of laforays
words a broad and hastening trail slant-
ed athwart the course a trail of hoof
and moccasin of dragging travois shreds
of domestic wreckage broken poles the
signs of a village on the move a black-
foot village

  trails a day old said herring amid
nods send word back to bridger

  nothing to tell jim yet laforay
countered they go around that ridge
or else through by the pass we go on
top and see

  i vote the same herring agreed
my finger itches what say kit  
bridger can come on at his own gait
carson said may be the eagle himself
i aim to keep going

  they pressed on then suddenly la-
foray pointed

  look  look you see injun on them
rock making sign of enemy come  they
try to hold the way village close my
knife she stir true village close 
likely the eagle himself hurray 
time bridger comes up well have more
hair-	

  wait look hyarl matson one of
the men who had ridden off to scout that
slanting trail was waving at them shout-
ing hyar come on 

  they rode to join him he had halted
near a travois litter abandoned beside
the trail a blanket-covered form on it
carson shrank a little he knew what
was coming and he was right matson
turned to climb back into the saddle
face beaded with sweat hands shaking

  dont tech it dead buck in it i
looked in died o smallpox yonder in
the bresh is a womans body by god
ill not take this trail death trail sure
damn said laforay live injuns
on that ridge i go that far anyhow
me too herring agreed ill take
no defy from any blackfeet let the
damned pelt go that medicine has
turned sour but well clear the ridge

carson rode on in the lead up the
pass for the ridge the men strung
along laforay drew up to his stirrup

  too bad kit we mus let village
go mebbe that rapahoe squaw shes
dead but plenty eagles on the ridge
up there sure

  carson nodded ridge has to be
cleared or the trail is cut for the whole
brigade ill not wait for bridger though
the rest of you do as you please im
going over strike the trail again and
keep going to the end of it

  i see your knife red my knife red
said laforay moodily much death
death for many for some of us mebbe
mebbe you find squaw kit got to
hurry

  hurry carsons heart sank as he
looked ahead as the riders bunched as
they realized what they faced and heard
the taunting yells of the redskins above
	the blue book magazine

  one end of the ridge broke down
sharply for the canon here the village
had passed no thoroughfare there
with blackfeet clustered above arrows
already singing voices mocking at the
other side were the cliffy ramparts of the
abutting hills and all along in the front
a smooth upward rise of two hundred
yards thinly grown to grass and brush
sprinkled with low rocks crested on top
with a bristle of stunted pines and jagged
boulders where the whoops of the enemy
rose the men lost heart

  theyre too well forted wed lose
every hoss on that open slope wait for
jim

  a hundred or more blackfeet up there
obviously cafsons pause was momen-
tary as the yells and taunts were hurled
down but one voice well-remembered
came above the others gibing at him
j ho little chief you are all wom-
en turn around go back to your pots
up here are men

v if youre a man and not a squaw
wait 

  carsons shout pealed up he shook
his rein sent his horse forward the
horse leaped to jamming moccasin hills
and clapping palm swerved from a fusil
ball that jerked up dust recoiled from
the steep slope the yells the arrows
laforay tumbled off his mount

  wait kit i go too 

  he was stripping to moccasins and in-
dian clout belted himself with knife and
hatchet reslung horn and pouch over
shoulder he stood naked long-haired
lean of arms knobby of knees wrinkled
and scarred a tremendous whooping
yell burst from him

  ho i am iroquois you are rats
hiding in holes i come smoke you out
damn quick he paused to cram bul-
lets into his mouth leave hoss kit
go quick village run

  carson dismounted laforay was a
host in himself he heard herrings hot
oaths behind him heard the other men
cheering laughing as they ran with him
and laforay for the slope of death

up they went stooping panting dodg-
ing lead hummed feathered shafts
whistled but the blackfeet shot high
they came to the crest neared it car-
son heard his own voice yelling in the
snake lingo

  wait for me plenty eagle stand in
my way squaw wait

  the fire died down they had reached
the crest came flooding over it the

enemy had given way the ridge here
was broad broken with scraggly trees
and large rocks by the glimpses of
painted shapes dodging about the en-
emy were fewer than appeared but
enough to play for time while the village
fled

  now battle met battle stubbornly
men shooting from cover yelling rifles
cracking through it lifted the whistle
and the lusty voice of plenty eagle rally-
ing his warriors directing them carson
dodged on eyes and ears searching that
lordly chief suddenly he heard another
voice in english

  this way over here everybody
the voice prickled in his memory
mans voice it seemed  but he had heard
this voice ere now misleading to betrayal
shunans daughter he heard laforay
at his side grunting exclaiming recog-
nizing that voice and then darting aside
glistening naked like a snake worming
among the rocks

carson held to his course a hound
of fury a vista opened before him
the tall massy shape of plenty eagle
closed it carson saw him pause raging
and fearless the rifle cracked a feath-
er floated from the sleek crown and the
eagle was gone carson cursed his hasty
shot and paused to reload a yell reached
him

 kit laforay here somebody-
im down-

  no false lure this time--it was her-
rings voice carson broke into a run
hearing whoops of triumph he saw that
herring was down in a little clearing
thigh broken shirt reddened blackfeet
racing in to take the trophy two of
them herring with mighty effort half
sat up swung rifle and fired one brave
went down carson lined on the other
-and sighted a third figure charging in
like a cougar on full bound plenty
eagle but no changing now that
warriors hatchet was up for the coup

  the bullet went true the blackfoot
yelled and plunged headlong carson
with a shout dropped rifle and hurled
himself forward the eagle was too
swift for him-pounced and drove his
hatchet through herrings feeble guard
stooped and swooped with his knife and
then was away with his scalp-yell ring-
ing high away not pausing to fight
but vanishing amid the rocks

  carson lifted the crimsoned head the
eyes of herring opened looked up at
him with recognition held a glimmer of
lifes a fight kit	

a smile and then closed herring was
dead with one leap carson was up
had his rifle and was after plenty eagle

  by the sounds the blackfeet were in
retreat retiring not in flight but stub-
bornly carson raging fuming knew he
had lost the eagle again he ran peer-
ing zigzagging frantic to pick up the
trail wounded blackfeet vicious as
stretched rattlesnakes lay here and
there among the rocks

  another figure uprose suddenly   
old laforay whirling about grinning
widely and lifting hand to carson his
knife still unstained carson arrived
looked and saw shunans daughter for
the last time

  slim and rounded in her doeskins but
no longer lovely the death shot had
not disfigured her it had gone straight
to the heart her braids lay flung on
either side of her upturned face an ugly
face now repeljant seared with the pits
of smallpox as rain drops spatter soft
clay gone was all the masking lure of
eyes and lips

  by damn she play no more trick
exulted laforay you not find plenty
eagle

  no

  too late men be coming back i
guess fraid to follow to village village
be on run too well-laforay fingered
his knife-point-this woman all same
man wait a minute then we find rube
rubes gone carson said under
plenty eagle got him my hands are
empty and im going on

  wait youre heap crazy cant do
nothing without hosses-

  carson was gone regardless running
plenty eagle was somewhere the vil-
lage must be in wild flight

  as he ran he saw that the whole top
of the ridge had apparently been cleared
the men gathered together were on his
left heading back toward the horses he
caught their complaints of light horns
and pouches their cursing of plenty
eagle their resolve to let the village go
its way doomed they did not notice
him and he slipped on

there were dark stains among-the
rocks here he saw near the far
edge of the ridge a stand had been made
he hurried on crossed the high horizon
had a sight of the lowering ground be-
yond a stream glinted in the sunset

  beyond against a patch of dusty
ground lodges were struck horses and
travois were already loaded squaws and

children worked like mad mounted
warriors refugees from rout emerged
from the down slope and glinted on with
hastening shout and signal plenty
eagle singing bird-if alive still
carson his throat dry ran on

  then all suddenly without warning he
beheld an amazing thing

  two hurt warriors one supporting the
other at a hobble bolted from hiding-
place among the clustered rocks ahead
carsons sights found them but he held
his fire as another figure leaped into
sight with a great shout plenty eagle

  a chieftain bloody proud standing
with opposing arms crying something
at the two men angrily one of them
flung a furious jeer at him

  out of the way you are nobody
your medicine is death-

  a hatchet flew with the words a
hatchet from warrior to chieftain dis-
graced the cast was badly timed the
handle not the keen blade rang on the
bronze chest and went clattering among
the rocks the two warriors hobbled
on with another insult the eagle
reached out grasped his gun from among
the rocks turned with fury then car-
son screamed at him

  plenty eagle wait for me woman
wait 

staring intent haggard the chief
faced about then his eyes glowed
his gun swung up carson heard the
ball whish like an angry hornet his own
rifle leapedto the release of powder and
lead the two shots were almost blended
and the medicine sack on the eagles
chest lifted and swung

  a cry fierce and sonorous burst from
plenty eagle he staggered backward
dropped his gun went to hands and
knees-was up again tottering erect
chest crimsoned lips drooling redly his
hatchet was in his grip now

  he came forward walking as though
unhurt it was incredible to carson
the ball had gone true the medicine
sack was dyed darkly with blood yet
the man walked with head high his
bloodied lips twisted to a chant of defi-
ance

  i see you little chief you see me
my medicine is strong against your bul-
let it turned the hatchet of those cow-
ards it turned the sickness you are
a man but you are helpless now you
are going to die-

  carson dropped rifle whipped out
knife and with an oath hurled himself
	the blue book magazine

in plenty eagle halted to meet the
rush his hatchet swept out and down
carson parried it and the green river
knife drove in

  head back plenty eagle sent his death
yell at the sky and with a burst of
crimson sank to the earth carson stood
above him waiting those proud black
eyes opened and sought the setting sun
carson leaned forward

  listen this is death where is
singing bird

  the bullet had not failed after all
the naked bronze body was scored by
bullets and blows the painted face was
lightly pockmarked the medicine sack
had fallen aside and with every shallow
breath life came bubbling from the bul-
let-hole in plenty eagles chest his lips
moved slightly carson bent to hear the
murmur

  dreams lie they lie all the medi-
cine is bad-

  with that plenty eagle shivered as
though cold and relaxed and died a
fallen chief but still a chief and with
him died his dream of savage empire

  carson used the impatient knife and
secured his trophy then he snatched at
the medicine sack it held a little plate
of sheeted mica and the snipped piece
of white beaver pelt sent by bridger in
mockery

  the mica was drilled through the
ball had gone on through flesh and bone
the sack might have blunted a loosely
seated ball but through it had gone the
hard-rammed bullet delivered by bright-
grained english powder

carson rose to the sound of hoof-
beats he saw laforay coming up
clothed and mounted with a led horse
in his belt was tucked a scalp with long
and glossy hair

  by damn you get plenty eagle
good i come look for you now we

o	to bridger nothing more to do
  ere

  wrong carson reached for the
horse thankfully im going on

  that rapahoe gal plenty eagle
say where she is

  no ill find her

  what i tell you las winter i see
sky like blood big fight death for many
our knives bloody the rapahoe squaw
waiting for you but the trail is dark
i not see her now we go find bridger
kit

  carson gathered rein turned horse

  go ahead tell bridger ill be back

 look-nobody down there they
travel fast-oh hell damn you one
big fool but i go far as you do

  carson rode on aiming for a lesser
pass ahead and laforay rode with him

in the gathering darkness they put the
down slope under hoof rapidly here
was the village site ahead a few lodges
still standing along the stream but all
deserted and empty now the dust of
flight rose far in the fading western glow

  the village site was littered with aban-
doned articles the lodges were closed
and of a sudden laforay burst out
wait only dead here my medicine
say go on kit go on  she be in lodge
all alone i see her my medicine show
me lodge by itself look for that
they found it after a little a solitary
lodge up the stream carson trusting with
curious dull confidence to this medicine
talk a lodge with the flap fastened
down it was all cold no sound came
from it carson dismounted laforay
also in a sweat and a tremble

 death here kit mebbe you not
like what you see better stay away
carson walked to the flap jerked it
free and threw it back he stooped and
looked inside death yes

  the old medicine-man hideous and
contorted an arrow through his heart
and cast down beside him bedraggled
dishonored the white beaver pelt the
blackfeet had turned on the makers of
this medicine turned on plenty eagle
on this medicine which had brought
them destruction instead of glory

  suddenly a cry broke from carson
beyond the medicine-man a form trussed
corpse-like in a blanket upturned face
pallid eyes closed her face-singing
bird dead he darted in lifted her
staggered outside laforay lent a hand
cut the lashings and cried out

  look by gar she not dead kit
her eyes opened she looked up
wondering incredulous afraid

  you  she murmured it is a dream
i am dead

  carson laughed and tapped the scalp
in his belt

  plenty eagle not you you see me
you are well have you had the sick-
ness 

 no she said that is why the
blackfeet tied me up they said i made
it because it passed me by

  and it passed me by at bents fort
said carson the sign is good lets

go

singing bird-

dead carson
darted in lifted
her trussed form
and staggered
outside the lodge
of death

  singing bird cast off the blanket came
to her feet and laughed a little as she
met the flashing eyes of carson this
trail was ended the medicine was good

chapter xvii

june had burgeoned packs were
heavy the beaver had come well to
trap fort hall on the snake was
in prospect now and from there the sum-
mer rendezvous again in the valley of
the green

  the brigade all united for the march
into the fort stopped this night near a
village of the friendly flatheads beside
a little lake a good folk these flat-
heads of the oregon country open of
hand rich in herds hostile to the horse-
thieving blackfeet

  the leaders were made welcome in the
village there was open talk no secrecy

  the blackfeet they are nothing
a sickness has rotted them for their lies
and they have gone into the bellies of
the wolves and ravens they did not
know of any great medicine and they


the blue book magazine

are punished they died in their lodges
the white beaver medicine is yet to
come

  who tells you that bridger de-
manded

  the nez perces say it others say it
they have been told the white beaver
medicine that makes people strong who
have it will pass the mountains this
summer we are going to meet it
there was a hum of assent of eager-
ness but no war talk

hell rid of one trouble into anoth-
er bridger turned to laforay whats
that somebody said about fort hall
the old man there say the hudsons
bay hold it

  it is true the old flathead was
positive i was there the captain
sent word to the snakes the nez perces
everybody to come and trade with him
we do not need to go to the americans
at green river

  bridger fumed the only american
post west of the mountings gone under
oregon all british hudsons bay com-
pany facing east-now another white
beaver medicine due cording to the
sign theres going to be powder burned
this summer both sides the divide-
suddenly laforay leaped to his feet
arms flung wide eyes dilated

  jim kit my medicine tells me
i see it plain white beaver she come
by the south pass for sure no red sky
this time

  who brings it demanded carson
i dunno injuns there we are there
you and me i see shouting shooting
white beaver strong very strong not to
be stopped- suddenly as the exalta-
tion came on upon him it was gone
again he checked himself his face
became stolid his eyes dulled all gone
now if i tell you more you say im
crazy

  he would utter no further word

on they rode again-into fort hall
where the british flag flew now
covering the trail into oregon thomas
mckay was there dark and suave and
firm welcoming carson and bridger
warily holding council with them

  and have you furs for the post
not for this post answered the
blunt bridger them furs go to ren-
dezvous and american market we need
to outfit a trifle though how happens
youre here

  mckay smiled the american own-
ers found the trade not to their liking

the injuns wouldnt come in they pre-
fer the company methods

  and the company told em where to
float their sticks bridger spat whats
this new medicine talk thats filling the
air we took care of one talk the
mouths of the blackfeet are closed plen-
ty eagles medicine was bad

  so ive heard i know nothing about
this new talk mckay shrugged as
far as i can learn the nez perces look
for the white beaver medicine to come
from the sunrise i dont pay much at-
tention to medicine talk that is un-
less it threatens company interests

and in this case what bridger de-
manded your medicine points
east your feet are turned that way
white beaver medicine will smooth the
trail mebbe

  mckay was earnest honest

  the company has absolutely nothing
to do with this medicine craze if the
country east of the mountains falls away
from the americans itll fall into a brit-
ish northwest london and washington
will come to an agreement-

  there wont ary agreement shine
while theres american rifles in oregon
flared up bridger if you count on an
injun war to smooth the trail you
mights well lift your traps for theres
no ketch well make this here trail
down the snake a war trail clean to the
columby

  well not quarrel bridger mc-
kay smiled oregon is already in full
possession of the british as you see
your government is scarcely prepared to
march troops over the mountains no
oregon cant be won by arms except as
the company controls it by arms and
wisdom and peace well mr carson
you decided not to trap with me eh
right i had other work to do
you and shunan had trouble i un-
derstand

  all ended now said carson his
bones are clean and his daughters as
well

  mckay frowned his daughters
a handsome girl a wonderful girl you
say shes dead

  yep said bridger and she was a
good string to your fiddle warnt she
well let it pass kits got plenty eagles
hair and the rapahoe are going to figure
the americans are somebody you bet
well do we trade with you or not
trade for beaver yes outfit competi-
tors no mckay was put out disap-

pointed thrown into consternation by
the upset of all his hopes these bales
of american beaver were a small for-
tune

  the brigade rode away for the valley
of the green   

  bands were hastening eastward now
and the summer rendezvous camps were
gathering-snake flathead nez perce
pend doreille white beaver medicine
white beaver medicine the words
were on every tongue what they meant
none knew if the nez perces knew they
would not say but the flame was every-
where spreading like wildfire strong
medicine to make the hearts stout

  who had spread this whence it had
come what it meant was impossible to
say most took it literally carson sus-
pected some other meaning suspected
that laforay knew or guessed but la-
foray held stubborn silence and dis-
claimed knowledge

  so they marched on amid banter con-
fusion doubts defiance and they came
at last into the rendezvous before the
brigade had unpacked bridger and his
aides were called into council by other
leaders all puzzling over the same thing
what was this white beaver medicine
the redskins had gone crazy with talk
of it

  how about it bridger

  ive alius found the strongest medi-
cine is a strong heart said old bridger
if we have to fight all the injuns to
oncet do it i our daddies did it back in
kaintuck and ohio the trail weve
opened into oregon aint to be closed
right the goods caravan from the
missouri aint come in is overdue the
utes and the rapahoes are holding off
mebbe they got the medicine or are
waiting on it-

  no laforay yelled out excitedly
it come by the south pass it come
now shes be on the way it bring
smoke shooting shouting-hurry 
hey yells lifted to those in coun-
cil there go the injuns 

dream or shrewd hearing on la-
forays part no matter jhe in-
dians were mounting and pelting away
the whites followed rifles ready to hand
there was mad running and mounting
and madder riding bridger took the
lead others pelted after at his heels

  the rider galloping in on the trail
from the south pass had fired his rifle in
air as signal but bridger scarcely drew
reinon meeting him

  whats the sign 

  caravans near the top bound over
and down

  that there white beaver medicine
  youve said it

  come on-and bridger thundered
away with the mob at his heels

  the long scored trail up the slope of
the south pass was flattened by the
thudding hoofs now the summit rose
ahead bare and level the open gateway
into an oregon hung up as the prize to
the stronger party if the medicine call
brought the tribes of mountains and
plains on the war trail the road into the
northwest might for a long time be slip-
pery with blood and worse carson
remembered mckays remark of afore-
time 

  thats only another step if the unit-
ed states cant hold all that country
from the indians better give over the
bad bargain to people who can

the verge of the broad summit was
ahead there they glimpsed a milling
throng whites and indians volleys of
shouts smoke spurting guns banging
bridger had his rifle ready others were
ready as they tore in the caravan was
surrounded it looked like a battle in
all truth

  then bridger gaped horses were
reined in astounded realization drove
home

  not a battle at all madly circling
whites and nez perces flashing salutes of
harmless powder yelling jubilantly
gawking trappers and indians the st
louis caravan at impatient halt in the
center of all a little group of states trav-
elers trail-worn on their knees facing
oregon the american flag waving car-
son heard the murmurs of the crowding
nez perce women

  white beaver white beaver the
white beaver come 

  goddlemighty  yawped bridger in
astonishment white women aint
so cant be 

  it was two white women american
white women young women the doc-
tor of last summers rendezvous whit-
man stood up and came to bridger

  you see i brought them as i en-
gaged to do 

  aint so gasped bridger another
medicine dream thats what

  some laughed but whitman frowned
puzzled

  thats what i dont understand
bridger they tell us weve been ex-
	the blue book magazine

pected these nez perces keep talking
about white beaver having come they
seem to refer to the women i took
two nez perce boys back east with me
last year they talked a great deal
about a white beaver dream some medi-
cine sign that would cross the mountains
and change the color of the country
when they learned that white women
were coming with us they seemed tre-
mendously impressed could they have
sent word ahead it is impossible
jim bridger rubbed his chin

  the arrer flies he muttered the
arrer flies if you can tell me how in-
juns read sign out of the air i can tell
you why buffler stampede on a calm day
with not even a snake in striking dis-
tance of em where you aim to go
on through oregon to the lower
columbia

  them your wagons 

  yes

  cant be did you cant take wheels
let alone women

  one of the ladies is my wife the
other is the wife of brother spalding
they are going through the wagons will
go as far as possible well mark a trail
for other wheels to follow with other
americans men and women for oregon
well be making ready for them

  aim to settle your women out yon-
der why there aint a white woman
twixt here and the mouth of the colum-
by none there even

  whitman laughed there soon will
be we carry the bible the flag the
american home bridger were here to
occupy oregon youll soon see the
trails of the plains and mountains white
with wagons

  by damn broke out laforay all
a-stare i see the sign sure white
women-white beaver sigh it pass the
mountains make the stronger side who
have it

  bridger slapped his leather thigh his
eyes moist

  white skin prime grade injuns and
hudsons bay cant match it beats
brown skin and old pelt sure reckon
though ill stick to brown skin as long
as beaver swim  its best at squaw work

carson felt a touch and turned
singing bird stood there her eyes
shining

  little chief you are glad  you will
follow the white women the nez
perces say they are the medicine all
the land will be white not red

  go back with the women singing
bird said carson presently i will
come all will be made straight the
trail is clear

  bridgers jovial voice broke in

  movin along kit ketch up ketch
up tjierell be fourth o july doins
in the camp well all dance medicine
danged if white skins aint good for eyes
and heart howsomever it didnt come
out here to tend pot on the trapline
brown skins fittenest there

  carson made no answer he climbed
into the saddle and sat there alone his
gaze flickering across the scene yet see-
ing nothing here singing bird had gone
with the others two white women
only two but they were breaking a
medicine trail clear across the plains
into farthest oregon

independence day of  another
medicine sign for the hudsons bay
to read he wondered what thomas mc-
kay would say to this mckay not
him alone but bridger and all these
laughing excited mountain men not
theirs to laugh if they could only rea-
lize the truth maybe rube herring
was lucky after all and the woman who
had waited for him-and would wait a
longer time now   

  wheels a new symbol carson mused
darkly to replace the old symbol of the
medicine sack that was passing now
wheels were coming bible flag farm-
ers nobody else could see it but car-
son saw it as he sat there the brief
flaming glory of the mountain men was
doomed they were doomed beaver
was doomed and trapping queer how
the men had talked that night in camp
about living to see what would happen
around here they would all see it
quickly enough but none of them had
guessed right wheels-that was it
white women and wheels and homes

  carson thrilled suddenly he had it
he had found it-the elusive thing the
aim and end the reason for his being
here the future ahead of him prime
mountain man no he was done
with all that for ever he had found
hirtiself now wheels were coming
wheels with need for guides white wom-
en with need for guards the mountain -
passes must be explored california
and oregon and the salt lake country
must be opened up bridger says it
cant be done it must be done it will
be done wheels will go everywhere

came to fleshing-block and stretching-

few more seasons and the swarming

with wheels lay the future and white
women and homes

  he stirred in the saddle his long
gaze focused on the figures trudging afar
queer things stirred in his brain in his
heart a moment had swept everything
away and away he was changed every-
thing was changed his eyes were op-
ened and the road was opened the road
of the future singing bird was compli-

was good let her go now as in the
instant when his knife had poised above
that trapped and dying blackfoot time
stopped for carson now as then flash-
ing things flickered across his brain

  queer he thought what depth of wis-
dom lay in medicine talk white beaver
medicine-to make strong those who have
it make strong these were white
women making their men strong in the
present and the future the vanishing

  as he picked up his reins some-
thing stirred at his belt it was the scalp
of plenty eagle so long sought so bit-

too was a symbol a symbol of all he had
hoped and been and attained but now
there were new things to be attained a
revulsion against everything that was in-

in his heart he loosed the scalp from
his belt and looked down at it musing

  odd so sudden a change but per-
haps it had been growing in him unper-

had opened the trail to him he could
see the future now very clearly no
man goes ahead in a straight line always
life is not like that the road turns
branches off new aims new ambitions
suddenly sweep into light new hori-

go straight they must bend to the guides
of destiny and terrain

  carson smiled dropped the scalp in
the dusty road and sent his horse for-

progress backed by legislative
action brought to the new york
state police a lusty infant formally
called the bureau of criminal investiga-
tion and promptly dubbed by the news-
papers scotland yard

  stripped of much official wordage this
meant that each troop was to have a
unit of men operating in plain clothes
who would specialize on the solution of
major crimes and be relieved of routine
patrol duty promotions to the new unit
were made on the basis of competitive
examinations the necessary increase in
personnel was supplied by recruiting

  the black horse troop took all this
in its stride amid some growling from
captain charles field commanding offi-
cer who declared

  nothing new just checking up on
unsolved cases and keeping after them
until you break them we always did
that

  despite his assertion however things
were happening sergeant john king

high man in the examination for which
all sergeants were eligible was commis-
sioned as a lieutenant and assigned to
the new unit other lesser places were
quickly and satisfactorily filled all
that was as it should be and even the
defeated candidates admitted that the
successful men rated the promotions

  then the three lieutenants of the
troop with the exception of the newly
commissioned mr king tackled the ex-
amination for the post of inspector and
head of the new unit in the troop lieu-
tenant joseph winch was high man and
his average was above the mark obtained
by several men who received the like ap-
pointment in other troops that too
was as it should be but then the blow
fell

  lieutenant jonas crossbeth a down-
state product was commissioned as an
inspector and assigned to head the scot-
land yard unit of the black horse troop
this was just one of those things which
happen now and then in almost every
police organization and which in the
long run produce their own solution but
loom large as sore spots while that solu-
tion is in the making

lieutenant winch took matters calm-
ly but not the other members of the
black horse troop they swore a little
growled a bit and prepared to make
things interesting for inspector crossbeth

its down liore
said junior tinys
grin hid his in-
ward excitement
junior you and
i are partners
arent we can
i trust you


   a swift-moving story of tiny
   david and the state police

by robert
r mill

  they were not acquainted with the
gentleman but they were very sure they
wouldnt like him he might be a good
policeman there was a chance that he
might be a swell fellow that mattered
not at all even then they would not
like him for the black horse troop
as many men in many stations of life
have learned to their sorrow is a close
corporation

  inspector crossbeth pleased them by
getting off on the wrong foot almost
from the minute of his arrival he had
taken courses in criminology and crime-
prevention at a leading university he
was willing nay eager to tell about it
he had studied police methods in
europe his conversation included what
were intended to be casual references to
high officials and places abroad with all
of which his listeners gathered mr
crossbeth was quite familiar the new
arrival unlike the majority of the men
about him found openly expressed pleas-
ure in the fact that his unit was known
as scotland yard

these facts which became known in
less than two hours were reported
to lieutenant james crosby who at once
retired to his room when he emerged
he wore a soft hat the brim of which
had been squeezed into two points and
which was worn with one point forward
and one point aft mr crosbys face was
adorned with a large pipe clutched in
his right hand was a magnifying-glass
through which he peered at the spotless
surface of the table in the living-room

  behind mr crosby watching him with
keen and admiring interest slouched
lieutenant edward david the largest
man in the troop and therefore known
as tiny

  mr crosby gave a hoarse cry of tri-
umph dust just as i suspected

  remarkable said mr david

  out in the hall mr crossbeth but-
tonholed sergeant henry linton

  who are they he demanded

  mr linton watched the performance
for a full minute before he replied

  look like sherlock holmes and dr
watson to me sir

illustrated by monte crews

  mr crossbeths face darkened i
asked you who they are sergeant
yes sir sher-that is the one with
the glass is lieutenant crosby doc-
the other one is lieutenant david not
bad chaps-for lieutenants

  mr crossbeth made a mental note
  and what is your name he asked
  sergeant linton sir

  ill remember that

  thank you sir

  mr crossbeth retired to the inner of-
fice he passed most of his time there
for the next two weeks and not without
tangible results from his facile mind
and pen there flowed forth a series of
plans of procedure to be followed in the
event of almost every major crime in al-
most every section of the troops terri-
tory

  the men of the black horse troop
chuckled there was nothing wrong
with the plans in fact virtually the
same procedure had been followed in
the same circumstances for years in the
past however when a patrol was sent to
a strategic point it had not been deemed
necessary to give the said patrol written
orders to be on the alert and to remain
there until relieved

  mr crossbeth however produced each
plan as if it were a child of his own
brain and heart he commented upon
the plans at length studding the con-
versation with references to his own ex-
perience and knowledge he calmly
ascribed the lack of enthusiasm and
even interest on the part of his listen-
ers to ignorance he wrote off their


the blue book magazine

where did they
go demanded
crossbeth the
boysllpsqulvered
but bis voice was
firm hes my
partner and he
told me not to tell

failure to take any interest outwardly in
their work and their failure to cite any
accomplishments of their own under the
same heading

  mr crossbeth was a product of city
streets these men regardless of their
origin had seen service in mountain
country and on lonely roads nature
can be a powerful ally or a dread enemy
in either role she is impressive enough
to keep the men who match wits with her
rather humble so the men of the black
horse troop who had met the test took
certain things for granted sooner or
later on their patrols you were bound
to meet plenty of trouble you stood up
to it or you didnt come out alive but
if you did come out why talk about it

  these men studied they wanted to
advance as much as anybody they
tucked textbooks in saddlebags and car-
ried them on long lonely patrols but
why parade your knowledge nearly
all of them had distinguished themselves
by acts performed quite outside the lim-
its of duty they were prepared to work
right through any emergency with no
reference to food or sleep their officers
knew it so why go around shouting
about it

all of which was quite over the head
of inspector crossbeth who continued
to draw plans of procedure for all emer-
gencies that had existed that might
exist and some that never could exist
he exhausted the letters of the alphabet
as a means of identifying the plans and
fell back upon numbers then even be-
fore his labor of love was completed
they had a chance to temper theory with
practice

two armed masked men paid an un-
heralded visit to the bank in notnac
they chose a day when the bank had
cash on hand to meet the payroll of a
paper mill near by they timed their
visit so they arrived at the bank during
the noon hour when a girl cashier was
the lone employee on duty only one
customer troubled them and he was
quickly disposed of they departed
richer by twelve thousand dollars amid
warnings they would shoot the first per-
son who attempted pursuit

  the black horse troop learned of
this when top sergeant max payton re-
ceived a telephone call from an excited
resident of notnac who had seen the
bandits run from the bank with a bag
stuffed with currency and climb into an
automobile this good citizen had tak-
en refuge in his own car and when the
bandit car proceeded south on the main
road he had followed at a discreet dis-
tance giving up the chase because of a
blowout

  sergeant payton jotted down a fairly
good description of the two men a com-
plete description of the car and its li-
cense number and then went to work
the bell on the teletype machine sounded
its call to action

  attention all stations i

  briefly and rapidly sergeant payton
flashed the necessary information he
was still at work when inspector cross-
beth appeared at his shoulder

  what is it sergeant
plan -a

 

  sergeant payton told him mr cross-
beth darted to the inner office he re-
turned carrying numerous pieces of
cardboard which he shuffled rapidly

  wait a minute    here it is-
yes he peered at the bit of card-
board plan -a sergeant

  mr payton continued with the de-
scription of the car

  never mind that sergeant order
plan -a put into effect at once

  mr payton tapped the keys

  plan -a goes into effect at once
he waited until mr crossbeth depart-
ed for the garage bound for the scene
of action then he added

by order of inspector crossbeth
that accomplished sergeant payton
continued the description of the car
he was joined by captain field who
asked

  got a copy of plan -a

  yes sir said sergeant payton who
produced it

  captain field inspected the plan with
interest

  everything is all right was his final
verdict he included an order to ap-
prehend the suspects if located i was
afraid he might have forgotten it

  mr payton decided the occasion war-
ranted some liberties

  tiny david and jim crosby should
be down in that section just where
will they fit in on this plan -a busi-
ness skipper

  they have no assigned station de-
clared captain field therefore they
have an outside chance of getting within
speaking distance of those two babies
that he added as he departed for his
office is why i am not worrying

messrs david and crosby journey-
ing from albany to the barracks
pulled up before the sub-station in deer-
ville five miles north of notnac shortly
before one in the afternoon

  linny they bawled in unison
sergeant linton appeared on the
porch

  fed your face yet asked mr
david

  nope said linton and thg-way
i feel right now i dont care if i never
eat

  mr crosby went into action

  outside of your conscience whats
troubling you

  mr linton lowered his voice

  its that misbeguided rookie they
gave me as a partner he gets dumber

and dumber told him to get the car
from the garage and he rams a pine
tree three hours for repairs i wish
he had listened to his old man and be-
come a shoe-clerk

  did you report the car out of serv-
ice asked mr david

  well no mr linton admitted
hes young and you know how they are
about things like that over at the bar-
racks

  in that case cut in mr crosby
who pays for said repairs

  mr linton appeared annoyed even

angry

  he cant pay for it because he has
only had two paydays you know how
it-

  in that case declared mr david
the very least we can do is buy your
lunch get your hat and a thumbtack
to keep it on with

as mr linton entered the building
 presumably in search of the hat and
thumbtack messrs david and crosby
followed engaged in spirited debate mr
david was inclined to believe their social
position was so secure they could afford
to be seen in public with mr linton
mr crosby was doubtful mr linton
named a certain place where he hoped
they both would be seen

  the clanging of the teletype bell si-
lenced the exchange they gathered
about the machine the message began
to come through

  mr linton whistled softly

  thats nice he murmured

  they all produced paper and pencil
as if in response to some unspoken
command and began to jot down the
information suddenly the clicking of
the keys ceased pausing in the middle
of a sentence then the keys resumed
the message

  you will be pleased to know said
mr crosby with heavy sarcasm that
plan -a now is in effect that re-
lieves you from all future thinking

  mr david turned to mr linton

  where is your station on that plan

  mr linton snorted with scorn

  the job was pulled south of here
that should put me on the south end of
the village along the main road but
we better check it plan -a looks just
like -z to me

  and while we are checking it put
in mr crosby somebody should get
word to the bandits that -a is in ef-
fect otherwise they might not know


the blue book magazine

do you want me to kill you tiny
david called the reply was lurid and
punctuated by shots

and might do something lord barrelhead
didnt include in the plan

  what are you going to use for a
carmr david asked mr linton

  yours said mr linton hopefully
if i dont i see a lot of walking ahead
of me and i doubt if any of the places
will have jobs open

  come on called tiny david

  they drove to the appointed station
after an hour of checking passing cars
mr crosby showed signs of mutiny

  the report said they headed south
the smart thing for us to do would be
to cruise in that direction not letting
anything get by us but working down
to where we might be able to do some-
thing besides pestering the public

   mr david voted in the negative
plan -a calls for us to stay here
all this declared mr crosby is
plain damn foolishness these two ba-
bies belong to some smart downstate
mob they cased the joint found out
about the pay-roll and when the dame
would be alone soon as they pulled the
job they made tracks for home if the
patrols below got set in time theyll
nab them as long as we hang around
here we are just warts on the nose of
progress and say does that plan make
any reference to eating

tiny david jerked a thumb at a
lunch-room near by

  hop over there and tie the bag on
pass up the eight-course item in favor
of something speedy take linny with
you i can hold down the fort ill yell
if i need you

   traffic was comparatively light with
pauses between cars word of the rob-

bery had gone out by radio and a little
audience gathered at some distance from
the troop-car

 from out of the crowd walked a boy
 of perhaps six or seven

 hello

 hello whats your name 

 huck

 is that short for huckleberry
 yep

 huckleberry pie

 naw say dont you read short
 for huckleberry finn

 good enough declared tiny david
 my real names junior the young-
 ster volunteered

 i see what are you going to be
 when you grow up 

 a trooper

 why

 want to put people in jail

 the idea has merit tiny david ad-
 mitted

 what  the boy tugged at the door
 of the troop car tiny david opened it
 want to get in 	

 is it okay 

 sure said tiny david

 the boy seated himself behind the
 wheel he fumbled for the gear-shift

 dont drive too fast tiny david
 warned keeping his face very serious
 nope

 the trooper walked away from the
 car to stop an automobile approaching
 from the north he checked an excla-
 mation as he walked forward inspector
 crossbeth was driving a newspaper
 reporter was at his side

 any luck askedthe reporter as the
 car halted

 tiny david grinned

 yes-they didnt head this way
 mr crossbeth glared at him whats
 that kid doing in that car 

 tiny davids smile became broader
 junior hes driving about ninety
 miles an hour and pulling closer to the
 bandits every minute he has his gun
 on the seat beside him and hes all ready
 to shoot it out with them how about
 it junior

 you bet 

 mr crossbeth noted a sympathetic
 smile on the face of the reporter and
 turned his attention to other things

 wheres linton is crosby with
 you 

 messrs linton and crosby whose at-
 tention had been attracted by the com-
 motion that attended the arrival of the
 car answered both questions by boiling
plan -a



out of the lunch-room mr crosby
who believed in preparedness had a
large slice of fried ham which he en-
deavored to fold between two slices of
bread

words failed mr crossbeth for only
an instant

suppose that car came along- he
began

 in that case mr crosby interrupted
 i would drop the ham

 mr crossbeth shifted the attack

get that kid out of the car

me asked junior

stay where you are junior tiny
david ordered that car he in-
formed crossbeth is assigned to me
until it is taken from me ill decide
who gets in it

you wont have it long mr cross-
beth promised his car got under way
headed south all of you will hear from
this

 he sounds sore said junior

messrs linton and crosby reen-
tered the lunch-room but emerged
a short time later

try the ham mr linton advised
and dont stint yourself this may be
your last meal on the state his grace
duke imalouse seems rather upset
come along junior said tiny da- 
vid i cant eat without my partner
there was a pause while junior men-
tally weighed the car against ice-cream
you bet

they seated themselves at a table in
the rear a great hulk of a man who
gazed with amused good nature at a
wisp of a lad who returned his glance
with blind hero-worship they worked
their way through to dessert

can i drive some more asked
junior

sure said tiny david you  are
good at it you must have had a lot of
practice

yes

does your dad have a car

my dads-dead

thats tough junior so is mine
tiny david sought to change the sub-
ject where did you practice driving
on a car in the woods back of my
house

a car in the woods tiny david re-
peated is it anold car

nope its a swell car

who owns it

i dunno

how long has it been there

   oh not long-a day or two ted and
 i found it when we were playing indian
 could you take me there

   you bet

   this is our secret junior we dont
 want other people butting in do we
 nope

   all right we will duck out the back
 way so nobody will see us and go take
 a look at your car

   tiny david paid the check and they
 departed by the rear door junior led
 the way over several back-yards to a dirt
 road which branched off from the main
 road soon the dirt-road entered a woods
 how far is it junior

   not so far

   they moved on and on the sturdy
 legs of the country boy moving tirelessly
 as they attempted to keep pace with the
 long strides of the man tiny david
 estimated they had covered almost a mile
 when the boy examined the foliage on
 one side of the road

   they burst through the leaves which
 blocked the entrance and emerged on
 what evidently was an abandoned lum-
 ber-road

   its down here said junior

  tiny david came to a halt he
 lowered his voice

   junior if we kept going on the other
 road where would we come out

   gee i dunno the boy pondered
 yes i do uncle jim used to use that
 road to haul apples to a cider-mill way
 the other side of notnac

   tiny davids grin hid his inward ex-
 citement his hunch might be wrong
 but he was banking on it

   junior you and i are partners arent
 we

   you bet the boys eyes sparkled
 tiny david produced paper and pencil
 and scribbled a hasty note


the blue book magazine

    i am going in to a car in the woods
  have a hunch the bank mob parked it
  there and will double back to it leave
  your car where it is have junior lead you
  to the beginning of a lumber road then
  send him home you both come along
  that road until you find me but take it
  easy

  tiny david gave the note to the boy
get back to the village as soon as
you can junior give that note to the
troopers dont give it to anybody else
and dont tell anybody about it can i
trust you

  the boy hesitated

  y-e-s but where are you going
  tiny david decided on frankness

  i am going after your car junior i
may have some work to do there if i
get it done ill let you drive the car-
really drive it

 gosh how about me helping you
with the work

 no tiny david ruled you can
help me a lot more by doing a quick job
with that note how about it junior
okay  the boy was off

  tiny david watched him out of sight
then made his way forward along the
lumber-road after he had gone a short
distance he knelt and examined the
grass he found two sets of automobile
tire-tracks one was faint the other
fresh

  the trooper continued along the road
he walked with the noiseless tread of
the woodsman keeping close to the
foliage at one side of the trail and mov-
ing along with a speed silence and even
grace strangely at variance with his size

he could not yet see the car when the
sound of a human voice caused him
to freeze in his tracks the voice came
from his right

 tiny david entered the woods and
made his way forward slowly heading
toward the sound soon he was able to
see one car he took another step for-
ward using heavy foliage as a screen
two cars were visible the trooper
took stock of the situation

 one car-it had been pushed to one
side and was almost hidden by branches
-answered the description of the auto-
mobile used in the bank-robbery tiny
david twisted a bit and obtained a view
of the license-plate the number was
the one that had gone out over the tele-
type the second car was parked in
foliage at one side of the lumber-road
it was an open roadster a sporty job

 and evidently the car junior had dis-
 covered while playing in the woods

   two men were seated in the roadster
 they wore the garb of hunters com-
 plete to the last detail even the but-
 tons of their hunting-licenses were to be
 seen in their hatbands

 tiny david smiled grimly he saw
 it all now it was a clever plan he
 should have seen the contradiction at
 the start he swore silently as he re-
 membered they all had been too busy
 with plan -a to think of much else

   the bank-robbery had been perfectly
 planned and perfectly executed-ob-
 viously the work of professionals the
 get-away on the contrary had been
 clumsy a blundering citizen had been
 able to follow the car obtain a com-
 plete description of it even down to the
 license-number and report which way it
 was headed

   all that tiny david realized had
 been part of the careful plan the ban-
 dits wanted that car to be the object of a
 search they knew it would be off the
 main road before the patrols could get in
 position now back at the spot where
 they had hidden the second carj and
 changes of clothing they were waiting
 for the chase to die down a bit then
  two hunters dressed entirely differently
 from the bandits and driving a car
 totally unlike the bandit car would ap-
 pear on the main road north of deerville
 and tiny david guessed drive north
 rather than south where they had de-
 coyed the search

   it was clever tiny david admitted
 it to himself only a small boy who
 responded to kindness and unburdened
 himself of his youthful confidences had
 blocked it the trooper amended that
 thought it wasnt blocked yet but
 junior had given him a gambling chance
 of blocking it

   the man at the wheel of the roadster
 turned to his companion

   how about it

   tiny david moved forward

   why not  hazarded the second ban-
 dit what can we lose 

    the driver chuckled

   just two honest hunters there was
 the whine of a starter going home
 after a day in the woods

   tiny david straightened

   stick them up he ordered as he
 spoke he leaped to one side

   a revolver shot acted as a period to
 the command and a bullet clipped
plan -a



tiny david grinned he is n sour-looklnfc dofc
junior but he really likes little boys

through the leaves where the trooper had
been standing tiny david fired into
the radiator of the roadster and then
sent a second bullet at the seat he saw
the driver slump forward

  the trooper leaped behind the trunk
of a tree he was just in time a bul-
let whizzed by him

  the second bandit threw himself be-
low the windshield and continued to fire
tiny david replaced the two exploded
cartridges

  do you want me to kill you he
called

  the reply was lurid it was punctu-
ated with shots

  tiny davids jaws tightened he fired
once twice he heard a groan and
pulled his revolver upward

  youve killed me came the cry

  you sound healthy retorted tiny
david he started forward warily i
am coming to you try any funny busi-
ness and i will kill you

  he reached the side of the roadster
the driver was unconscious there was
a hole in the shoulder of his coat his
companion clutched an arm and moaned
with pain

  youll live snapped tiny david
your pal wont unless we get him some-
where they are able to stop that weed-
ing- 

  he disarmed both men then he lis-
tened intently along the trail

  jim he called

  coming tiny roared the voice of
jim crosby

  they made short work of transferring
the bandits to the car they had used in
the robbery in the rumble-seat of the

 roadster they found a sack filled with
 money

 they pushed the automobile into the
 road linton drove tiny david and
 crosby remained with the prisoners in
 the rear

 hospital or morgue asked linton

 tiny david bent over the bandit

 hospital he said

 they approached the main road

 think you can handle them tiny
 david asked crosby

 sure what do you have on

 stop here tiny david ordered he
 jumped to the ground have to look
 up my partner

 crosby chuckled youll find him in
 the car he must have it up to ninety-
 five by now

 as tiny david walked south along the
  main road he saw a small crowd
 gathered about the car tiny david
 glanced over the shoulders

 junior sat firmly entrenched behind
 the wheel standing beside the car with
 one foot on the running-board stood in-
 spector crossbeth who did not look
 happy behind him stood captain field
 who looked rather amused

 where did they go demanded in-
 spector crossbeth

 i wont tell

 captain field tried his hand

 why wont you tell sonny

 the boys lips quivered but his voice
 was firm

 hes my partner and he told me not
 to tell

 tiny david stepped forward

 hello partner
plan -a

  he seized the boy pulled him from
behind the wheel and gathered him up
in his big arms

  meet junior captain hes one of
the best partners i ever worked with
he rapidly explained what had hap-
pened

  they didnt include junior in -a
captain he concluded but we better
put him in all the other plans

  inspector crossbeth cleared his throat
you say these men are at the hos-
pital 

  yep

  ill go over and take statements from
them

  swell idea said captain field
when crossbeth was out of earshot
the captain turned to tiny david

  heard from albany just before i left
the barracks crossbeth goes back down-
state and winch takes over

  was major harner sore asked
tiny david

  captain field chuckled

  he was sort of disappointed in you
said he had counted on you to take the
rough edges off crossbeth and make a
real officer out of him when he gets the
full report he may be satisfied
thanks to junior said tiny david
how about my car demanded the
boy and how about that ride you
said i could really drive

  tiny david grinned thats right
junior but your car needs a bit of
fixing will mine do

  you bet

  all right you can sit on my lap and
drive he turned to captain field
come along sir

  they climbed into the front seat
where to asked tiny david
juniors house said captain field
i want to talk to his mother

  is he going to tell on me demanded
the boy

yes said captain field i am go-
ing to tell your mother what the banker
told me hed do if anybody caught the
men who stole some money from him
what does he mean  asked the boy
tiny david grinned nothing to
worry about junior he is a sour-look-
ing dog but he really does like little
boys he rumpled the tow head pressed
against his chest his voice was a growl
he likes them almost as much as i do
shall we cut him in as a partner
okay said junior

   lost from us in far natowa an expedi-
   tion has sailed to their rescue but while
   we await its return let us enjoy these
   new stories of kiogas boyhood told by
   him to his friend dr james munro dur-
   ing the snow hawks sojourn in america

in far natowa-that new-found land
within the arctic circle-deep in the
still primeval forest called by the red-
skinned natives indegara there stands a
great rock called chieftains head sup-
posed to be the image of mialoka leg-
endary first-chief of all the shoni
tribes when the eyes of chieftains
head light up two-star the little son
of mialoka will return to take his place
among mortal men so goes the legend
implicitly believed among the shoni

  below this rock towering sentrylike
a hundred feet above the neighboring for-
est three rushing rivers meet their
meeting-place is known as the caldrons
of the yei a name which well describes
egainst a cjilderness

     a thrill-crammed adventure of kioga the snow hawk-
     a white boy reared among the natives of a new-found
     volcano-warmed forest north of siberia

the foamy chaos into which the min
rivers churn each other two of these
rivers are glacier-born the third springs
from its sources boiling heated by vol-
canic fires and where hot and frigid
waters meet there hangs above the cal-
drons a pillar of dense gray mist

  little is known of this lone unearth-
ly place reverberant with the hollow
roar of waters through the scoured-out
caves which honeycomb its rim but of
one thing the shoni witch-doctors long
were certain human bodies of enemy
or village-sacrifice consigned to the cal-
drons were never seen again the hun-
gry yei-mythical spirits of the rivers-
ate them so the indians believed

  what the caldrons finally discard at
their southern edges is sucked into the
vortex of a mighty cataract beyond then
smashed and swept into eternity    for
centuries no human foot had ever pressed
this place of peril nor human eye looked
on its inner mysteries and returned to
tell of what it saw   

  one day not many years ago some-
where between hopeka and the caldrons
of the yei a forest denizen stood belly-
deep fishing in the hiwasi river more
clown than fisherman the great brown
bear leaped among the shining salmon ar-
rowing upstream to their spawning-beds

  not once in fifty times did his swing-
ing claw-armed paw hook out a shim-


iis	the blue book magazine

mering fish more often the clumsy
bruin missed and fairly stood upon his
head amid the silvery horde

  from somewhere near the brush-grown
bank a peal of care-free laughter echoed
forth the bruins small red eyes turned
toward the sound beholding in the shad-
ows a familiar human figure of a youth
of perhaps fifteen in one strong hand
he grasped a pointed chipping-stone and
in the other a half-finished arrow-head
one edge cunningly sharpened the other
still quite dull pausing in his primitive
task he laughed again

  discomfited perhaps the bear regained
his poise reared up and with a sudden
lucky pass scooped a big salmon high in
air batting it fiercely toward the bank
before it fell

  by sheerest chance the salmon hurtled
toward the standing figure quick as
the flick of sparrows wing the supple
youth dodged twisting to one side but
for all his haste the writhing fish got in
one flat resounding blow delivered sting-
ingly the outline of a salmons tail
glowed redly on a brown bare hip

  much hurt and out of dignity-of
which the middle teens may have great
store-the figure leaped down upon the
flopping fish which got away then be-
lated self-command ensued he turned
back to the bank standing-by painful
preference-he meditated on the perils
of his wilderness

  the feathers of the snow hawk-or
kioga to call him by his shoni name-
were ruffled aki his wild companion
was laughing at him silently if expres-
sion meant anything at all high on the
bank with lolling tongue a fox grinned
down on him kioga flung a stick-and
missed the mark all things went wrong
this day again he stood straight and
silent as the trees beyond him

tall for his fifteen years already
kioga gave promise of the man he
was to be lithe and graceful with long
leopard-muscles he almost matched a
full-grown warrior in strength in
quickness and agility he far excelled the
practiced wrestlers and runners of the
shoni tribes-a nation of athletes

  eager to forget his earlier embarrass-
ment kioga plunged forthwith into the
river for a while he wrestled and
gamboled with his friendly partner the
bear as if born and existing only to
guard him from harm time and again
the huge brute dragged him bodily upon
the bank and soon kioga forgot his

earlier uncomfortable experience in the
excitement of diving to elude his burly
companion in the liquid element the lad
kioga was as adept and elusive almost
as the salmon aki was no match for
such tactics

so for an hour amusement crowded all
other thoughts from his mind sud-
denly kioga felt the bruin stiffen nos-
trils twitching toward upstream kioga
too chin-deep in water grew still clutch-
ing akis shaggy coat presently his
own nostrils little less sharp than his
wild companions caught the scent of
smoke-tanned garments worn on the
backs of men

  come aki  whispered kioga urgent-
ly pressing the rough shoulder if not
in true obedience then solely to be with
him the bear swam quietly ashore the
snow hawk still hanging on went with
him without an effort

  then from below the bank two pairs
of watchful eyes observed a tall canoe
move into their line of vision on the
forward seat a withered dried-up figure
sat-inkato the shaman famed and
feared for the power of his magic hide-
ous with self-mutilation he sat with
scarce a movement only his glittering
eyes denying him to be a mummy

  behind inkato a slim boy about ten
years old sat pale-faced with eyes of
fear thongs binding arms behind him im-
movably

  astern a lesser shaman propelled the
craft downriver and when the captive
struggled struck himcallously with the
flat of the paddle

  watching through slitted lis behind
which the greenish eyes blazed like melt-
ing emeralds the snow hawk growled
back in his throat and on a deeper
gruffer note the brute beside him did the
same-kiogas foes were akis too

  well kioga knew where and to what
fate the youthful victim went for one
black mark stands against the seven
tribes whereas their music and arts
are things to marvel at the age-old cus-
tom of human sacrifice still survives

  but a wrinkle of perplexity deepened
between kiogas eyes on some pretext
or other the shamans had decreed death
for this unlucky captive but why such
unaccustomed secrecy  why no chants
no beat of drums no myriad witnesses to
the high ceremony of human sacrifice
ofttimes before his keen young eyes had
seen the hapless victim knifed and
hurled headlong into the churning waters
one against a wilderness

watching the snow hawk growled on a deeper note the brute did the same

-but never in such furtive fashion al-
ways the village witch-doctors had been
on hand in full grotesque regalia

  clearly something was afoot some-
thing too dark and dread almost to
think about if all the other village sha-
mans were not supposed to know of it

  the canoe passed near the recent play-
spot the victims eyes turned mo-
mentarily shoreward as if seeking a way
of escape in that direction the quick-
ness of his indrawn breath sent the eyes
of inkato also shoreward with a start
he hissed back to his assistant kansa
saw you some one disappearing in the
bush

  i glimpsed a bear said the other

  no human leg with fish-tail mark
upon it persisted inkato

  not so perhaps i looked too late

  my lying eyes betrayed me mut-
tered the old shaman uneasily but
there is no time to lose the yei are
hungry push on  

  behind him the luckless little captive
slumped lower stoicism crushed by fear
of death

  push on the second shaman did un-
til the mighty millrace just above the
caldrons came into view on either side
black basalt walls reared up cracked
and broken ahead the pall of mist

above the caldrons eddied densely
shrouds-to-be of the shoni boy

  now came inkatos voice instinct
with cruelty with a quick swing
kansa flung the victim overside holding
the prey afloat while the older shaman
crept back with keen knife drawn

  up went the corded old hand the bone
blade gleaming

  then suddenly something pale oval
and speckled-the great egg of an em-
peror goose-hurtled from above the
wielder of the knife shrank back-too
late the half-pound egg too long un-
hatched burst hard against his temple
its evil-smelling contents spattering and
streaming down inkatos grimacing face

  to the liurler of that egg the boyish
victims face was not unknown he was
a lad from hopeka-the name escaped
kioga-recently stricken dumb when
lightning struck near where he stood

  startled the younger shaman released
his grip caught in the currents the
bound body was drawn beyond his reach
with eyes of fury inkato watched it go

  no matter he muttered finally
the yei take them dead or alive and
they return no sacrifice back careless
fool the current pulls us

  and inkato himself fearful of the
death he meted out so casually to others
the blue book magazine

knnsn hissed inkato saw you some
ono disappearing in the bush

seized a paddle forgetful even of the
stench which hung about his head a
moment later mouthing malediction on
the mother of that pungent egg the two
were gone upstream their ends achieved
so far as they could know

  but inkato was wrong whereas the
river-yei had swallowed up the victim
they did not quite digest the mouthful

  near where the mists were swirling a
second body struck the surface like a fly-
ing lance glancing deeply beside the
unconscious sacrifice a head appeared
its owner might have been a river-yei in
person up from the depths to claim the

slender body for around one strong fist
the younger lads braid was twisted

  a moment his supple strength against
the coiling sinews of three mighty
rivers kioga fought the currents alone
he might have had a chance as does the
reed that bends before a hurricane but
encumbered thus the waters had their
way with him

  tenacity however was in his fiber
the will to survive blazed with a fierce
white flame-else he had never lived this
long his grip upon that braid tightened
in a hold that only death would slacken
and in his dire extremity one single
name escaped him loud as healthy lungs
could shout it out

  aki aki i aki

  a momentary hush ensued broken only
by the sound of rushing waters then
came a roar like rolling thunder a splash
close by as if a ton of rock had fallen
and a great wave covered kioga and his
burden when shaggy fur came beneath
his hand the snow hawk clutched it
clinging like a limpet

  now vast primordial strength was
laboring for him-five hundred pounds
of solid buoyant brawn delivering power
through four thrusting paws gasping
stertorously the bear obliquely stemmed
the hungry eddies slowly neared the
carved-out caves

  dragged coughing to the surface ki-
oga caught a breath of air he had but
one thought to keep his hold on that
dark braid and on aki only one com-
mand to utter fiercely through clenched
teeth swim aki-swim

  the loyal selfless heart already pump-
ing near to bursting responded draw-
ing on unknown reserves of power
seeming hours were but minutes the
thrashing claws scraped bottom gripped
hooked onto stone and held then surg-
ing mightily aki dragged himself ashore

  kioga felt his grip loosening and
again the currents struggled to possess
him then the patient bruin did him
violence taking one forearm in gin-trap
jaws and dragging him for the hundredth
time to solid ground-and with kioga
came that other limp shackled body

ktoga came to consciousness rising
from a sea of pain a warm moist
roughness licked soothingly across his
naked chest a hot breath thawed his
tense and rigid muscles he saw a vast
dark shape bulking huge beside him and
rose up spent and trembling his first
thought for the one he had rescued
one against a wilderness



  beside kioga at full stretch the body
lay without a movement the snow
hawk wore no knife nor aught else
either but with a chip of stone he sawed
through the leather cords loosened the
boys apparel and began to chafe the vic-
tim back to life

  swift moments passed the rescued
one showed signs of life a ray of pale
auroral light came through the opening
of the cave and fell upon a thin wan
face colored slightly with returning
blood-a face of innocence marked by
an ugly bruise on one temple

  more gently now kioga chafed anew
luring the boy back to consciousness and
as he worked his eyes narrowed amaze-
ment resentment anger grew within
him-then black and bitter hatred of
those who had worked this crime against
a helpless child

the common bond of youth made that
offense seem greater until this hour
kioga had loathed the brethren who
devised such acts of horror-but with a
detached and general kind of loathing
face to face with dread reality his
hatred crystallized and sought some one
on whom to fasten he thought of the
two who had brought the sacrifice down-
river-old inkato and kansa his con-
federate

  they fed the yei in secret he mut-
tered hotly devising a thousand mental
tortures for the guilty pair i wonder
why but theyll pay blood for thy
blood little brother

  what the rousing sacrifice thought
waking in that reverberant cave to see a
bloody figure crouched above him and a
dripping bear near by can not be known
if fear kioga sought to calm it

  be not afraid he shouted in shoni
above the roar of waters none may
do you hurt while i am near i am ki-
oga-the outcast of hopeka 

  then wasting no time on further use-
less talk kioga armed himself with a
rock and explored about him seeking
means of egress from this cave-pierced
shore of the caldrons aki shuffled after
him

  one ledge ended at a whirlpool above
sheer rock slippery with condensing
mist offered no encouragement the
foam-capped waters-he had no wish to
challenge them again returning he
found another route along connecting
caves and passed from one to another
in an upstream direction somewhere
soon he thought the area of the cal-

drons must abut upon the neighboring
forest but the underground path he
followed ended in a wall

  in disappointment he hurled his stone
against it some slabs of rock weak-
ened by erosion slid from the wall he
hurled the stone again a threat of air
cool and dry blew through from some-
where bringing with it scent of pine and
hemlock encouraged kioga hammered
afresh desisting only when his stone fell
apart in his hands with naked hands
he tugged and strained but for all his
efforts he had only made an opening
large enough to get one hand through
one huge slab moved slightly if that
could only be moved a little more-
behind him aki sneezed with the
sound as of a parting compressed-air
coupling kioga jumped in surprise-
but with a great idea dawning direct-
ing the bears attention to the opening
smell aki he commanded the
brute sniffed eagerly caught the scent of
outer liberty and understood exerting
all his strength he pulled upon that slab
kioga also pulled with a rumble the
slab fell inward the way was clear

  a few minutes later kioga carried the
shoni boy out carefully concealing the
new-made entrance to the caldrons for
here was another retreat in time of peril

guarded on his way by one no
 other wilderness brute dared face
kioga moved north and westward
through the forest labyrinths never hesi-
tating though changing direction a hun-
dred times

  from thicket cave and deep ravine
eyes saw the little trio pass-eyes that
were bright as heated coins eyes like
mirrors reflecting flame many only cu-
rious many more hot with hungry men-
ace the shoni boy shivered in fear

  kioga soothed him bantering a little
fear not little brother who dares mo-
lest kioga and his friends what is thy
name he asked  then as he spoke he re-
membered that the boy was dumb but
to his surprise the other answered

  i am ohali my father is a chief -
my brothers all are warriors

  but you were dumb i heard the
shamans say it

  when the river took me i cried out
my voice came back

  why did the shamans give thee to the
yei 

  ohali shivered i do not know they
seized me in the night i struggled but
could not cry out


the blue book magazine

  a gust of fury swept kioga afresh
tearing out this vow theyll pay be-
fore the sun and moon and all the stars
i swear it	 

  where are we going back-where
inkato and kansa are

  kioga heard the boys teeth chatter
not so little brother while inkato
and kansa live youll not be safe in all
hopeka yet since they did not kill
thee why should i kill them there
must be a better way first we will rest
and eat

  where do you live  ohali asked
where once a tiger couched that is
kiogas home

  in awe ohali heard these words who
are you

  thoughtfully kioga answered putting
into words dim thoughts maturing ideals
of youth at shining manhoods threshold 
i am a friend to all like thee ohali i
place small birds back in the nest i
kill no doe with young i aid the weak
destroy the wicked strong and make them
fear me hast ever heard of robin
hood 

  ra-bin-hud echoed ohali repeating
the english words with unaccustomed
lips smiling kioga bade him forget the
question

  a friend of mine you would not know
ohali

  perplexed the thin young arms dark
with the marks of cutting thongs tight-
ened round kiogas neck i do not fear
kioga

  nor i the shamans muttered kioga
but ohali heard him not he was asleep

presently kioga turned off the
trail climbed a steep narrow path to
a point halfway up a frowning cliff
pausing before a mat of growing vines he
pushed them aside exposing a huge log
door chinked with mud and mosses
manipulating a latch kioga pushed in
the door and entered placing his burden
gently on a pile of thick soft furs

  with curving stick and leather thong
he kindled sparks and blew them into
flame and made a fire a veritable pi-
rates den that cave hung all about with
bows and arrows coils of leather rope
long whips that were the dread of every
brute that prowled the forest and many
kinds of indian garments and hideous
devil-masks

  one of the garments kioga fastened
round his waist with cord of buckskin
the slight demands of modesty thus
satisfied he went forth through the night

again returning in an hour laden with
nuts and berries and wild birds eggs

  upon the coals he set an earthen pot
filled with water from a rock-spring bub-
bling in the recesses of his cave and into
this flung quantities of dried meat and
vegetables from his basket stores

  then -beholding ohalis tattered gar-
ments from a leather case he pulled out
fringed buckskin shirt and leggings of
hide cured soft and white with mocca-
sins to match-his own gala boys attire
long since outgrown but treasured none
the less because a loved ones fingers
had sewn upon them these with other
ornaments he placed where ohali must
see them when he first awoke

  his body stretched to rest before the
bubbling stew kioga pondered how re-
turn ohali to hopeka without delivering
him back into the hands of inkato-
who one way failing would find other
means of persecuting the boy 

  still wrestling with that problem ki-
oga slept-in utter weariness

meanwhile pulling for hopeka
town upon the hiwasi river inka-
to had rested uneasily upon his paddle

  a leg with fish-tail mark upon it-i
cannot put that out of mind he told his
companion let us go back and look
along the shore if it were known we
did this thing-

  then came kansas voice guttural and
deep what have we gained by this
great risk because his father cursed
you when his son was stricken dumb-
was that cause enough to take ohalis
life

  we did not take a life corrected
inkato drawing a fine distinction we
gave it-unto the yei you see things
crookedly o kansa i fear you will
never be a famous shaman

  what would our fellow-shamans say
learning that we did this secretly with-
out their knowledge

  how will they ever know-unless you
babble kansa cease sniveling
uneasily kansa shook his head push-
ing downstream toward the point where
movement had earlier caught the older
shamans eye when they had arrived
inkato spoke

  go you ashore and look about i
will watch with bow in hand to see that
no harm befalls you

  kansa took up his spear and disem-
barked scanning the bank on every hand
then suddenly he straightened with a
hiss the footprints of a bear i see-
one against a wilderness	

eyes fastened up-
on the crown of
chieftains head
suddenly a cry
the legend is
come true the
eyes of mialoka
-they burn

and others manlike but smaller than a
warriors

  i knew it cried the old villain
fiercely we were seen-and kriqjv you
who made those tracks 

  kansa shook his head wondering at
the others agitation

  kioga  snarled inkato the weapoiis
quivering in his hand he who runs
with the bears of indegara 

  agh choked kansa his face losing
color what if he saw us throw ohali
into the river

  that egg-i should have known  re-
membered inkato back to the cal-
drons kansa make haste methinks
there is no good in this 

  the startled shamans returned to the
scene of their outrage and after search-
ing long they came upon fresher tracks
again of youth and bear together one
look at the human spoor and inkato
stiffened he carried a burden and
look you kansa-all were wet theres
mud within the prints and here-two
smaller prints 


the blue book magazine

   ohali lives muttered kansa we
 are betrayed

    inkato shook his head defiantly not
 yet you shivering fool back to hopeka
 -bend your paddle kansa or it may be
 you will never bend it again 

 awaking in the cave the first object
 l kiogas eyes fell upon was ohali
 standing straight and slender clad all in
 new white buckskin capped with crown
 of hawk-wing plumes on either wrist
 a ruddy copper bracelet and glittering
 and flashing in the firelight fine bead-
 work upon his breast and back

   a spark of inspiration touched kioga
 off

   ahai i see the way

   what way demanded ohali puz-
 zled by the words

   the way to put ohali beyond the
 reach of such as inkato hast heard
 the legend that when the eyes of mia-
 loka the first chief are seen to burn
 the son of mialoka will return to dwell
 with living men

    ahi answered ohali not understand-
 ing

   you shall be mialokas son the
 eyes of mialoka will burn tomorrow
 night 

   ohali had shivered at mention of the
 shaman inkato his poise was swiftly
 gone and fear looked from his eyes

   kiogas mind worked swiftly were
 it known what now he contemplated all
 shoni shaman-hood would work against
 him those less fanatic medicine-men
 who worked with roots and herbs and
 sought no power in primitive politics
 would frown on his scheme even the
 common populace would restrain him

   but there was the measure of kiogas
 peculiar daring half of his short young
 life had been an epic struggle-one
 against a wilderness a lone hand held
 no terrors his wits versus theirs-one
 brain against a hundred-would be no
  new experience

    he reprimanded ohali swiftly shrink
 not little brother stand proud and
 straight from this day forth the great-
 est chiefs will do thee honor far and
 near thy fame will spread and with
 the words kioga laughed aloud and said
 again the eyes of mialoka will burn
 tomorrow night and henceforward men
 will know ohali as two star son of the
 first chief 

    bewildered by this rapid flow of words
 ohali straightened once again how
 can this be

  pursing his lips and drawing in his
cheeks grotesquely kioga spoke as inka-
to was wont to boast i am kioga
greatest of all magicians then again
he laughed outright and ohali laughed
with him scarcely knowing why save
that with kioga near he could not long
be fearful or unhappy

  when their meal was done kioga
showed ohali tricks of sleight-of-hand
and while ohali sat entranced squatted
there before the little lad telling funny
tales to make him laugh and drawing
pictures on a buffalo-hide for ohalis
amusement-and for his own delight as
well for when ohalis laughter bubbled
up kioga listened raptly as a long-deaf
person might who heard a sudden note
of flutelike music not often had kioga
human friend to share his solitude   

  sometimes though a shadow crossed
ohalis face-a face too young to bear
such marks of haunting fear then pity
filled the snow hawks heart and to
erase the shadow he called in aki from
his guard-post outside the door and to
the trill of pan-pipes made aki rear
and dance and bear ohali on his shaggy
shoulders

  all in all it was a merry evening end-
ing far too soon in weariness ohali
slept as never in his life before

banking the fire kioga again quit
the cave then to the broad hiwasi
went sought out his hidden bark canoe
and on the central stronger current came
swiftly toward hopeka town hiding
his canoe kioga neared the palisaded
village afoot gained secret ingress and
prowling the shadows of the long-houses
came to the lodge of inkato the shaman

  listening he heard no sound within
entering stealthily-no lodge is ever
barred among the shoni-kioga found a
fire glowing by whose light his darting
gaze saw many things above the coals
a cooking-vessel simmered of which
kioga smelled turning up his nose to
one side hung a bunch of shriveled ber-
ries-a violent medicine whose attri-
butes kioga well remembered

  on a wicked impulse he flung these in-
to the cooking-pot adding also to the
broth some other near-by ingredients
which the shamans never prescribed for
themselves then stirring slowly he
sniffed again adding more of this and
that until the odor satisfied him by its
vileness

  hearing footsteps he hastily retreated
through a side entrance to the lodge and
one against

hid himself outside ear glued to the
barken wall soon some one entered
he heard the lisp of inkatos voice
speaking to a companion through tooth-
less jaws

  ehi-ehi a lucky thing we found
their footprints tomorrow we will
track them down with warriors from the
village all will think kioga stole ohali
from the village and when we come
upon them we will kill the snow hawk
and if added the shaman meaningly
ohali is also killed it will be by acci-
dent-will it not kansa-eh

  it will need doing quickly answered
kansa darkly lest ohali himself be-
tray us

  then see you carry springy bow and
sharp arrows leave kioga to my spear

outside the lodge kioga listened
missing not a word beyond doubt
the shamans knew ohali was still alive
if they had their way he would bear the
blame for the boys kidnaping and all
his plans would go awry to return and
efface the trail to the cave could yet be
done but that required time what
other way what better quicker way

  much that had been not clear before
was now explained the outrage they
had perpetrated on the river had not
even the slight redeeming color of re-
ligious sacrifice it had been attempted
child-murder brutal vicious and hidden
even from the other medicine-men

  among the shoni there is no penalty
for the taking of a life by custom as
among the old-time iroquois the killer
waits beside the body of his victim until
discovered life may call for life or a
gift to the nearest of the dead mans kin
to satisfy the spirit of the departed
thus the elements of primitive honor
prevail

  not so with inkato and kansa their
crime was so far without the pale that
not even their own fraternity must know
much less the family of ohali upon
this fact the quick wits of the snow
hawk seized at once his problem was
resolving rapidly

  but once more inkato was speaking
as if he had not recently returnedfrom
doing foulest deed come kansa fill
the bowls my belly is an empty gourd

  through a crack kioga saw kansa ap-
proach the cooking-pot fill one bowl
then sniff the contents doubtfully

  this soup-how strange it smells i
think- began kansa but inkato cut
him short indignantly

a wilderness	

  rich and full of strength fresh this
very morning drink heartily o kansa
and mayhap it will make you great-like
inkato and snatching the brimming
bowl the old shaman emptied it in greedy
gulps

  not daring to offend his host afresh
kansa held his nose and also drank
the two put down their bowls and sat
in silence

  then inkato to kansa spoke why is
your face so pale 

  kansa made a sickly grimace answer-
ing in a strangers voice i would have
asked the same-of you

  inkato gave a sudden mighty start
clutching at his middle

  and presently grinning with satisfac-
tion kioga went away one hour at
least would pass before these two could
go about again   

  this time kioga visited the longest
tongue in all hopeka town he found
her crouched before her lodge and stood
above her quietly

  some one is near said the old
crone harshly who is it 

  who brought thee sweets and cakes 
and wood to burn and water from the
spring when others all forsook thee
mother iska

  a moment she was silent her blind
mask softening then kioga lightener
of my sightless misery how dare you
enter hopeka where so many wish you
ill what would you have of eyeless
iska but ask and it is yours

  he pressed her gnarled old claws ten-
derly i ask no gift i bring you one
the gift you love the best kioga an-
swered

  something to whisper in my ear
she exclaimed in excitement bending
nearer avidly for news the spoken
word twenty kinds of gossip-all these
made iskas darkened world endurable

  a juicy something kioga agreed
and sitting close beside old iska spoke
long and earnestly-just as in years gone
by he had brought her other choice gems
of information

in rapt attention she heard him eh-
eh-eh  go on-go on   and as he
spoke she stiffened o hearts more
black than midnight what do you
say to me kioga

  tis true he assured her with
these two eyes i saw them throw ohali
in in these ears he told me all that i
tell thee the eyes of mialoka will burn
tomorrow night

  o wonder old iska fairly trem-
bled with the weight of this disclosure
it will shake all hopeka and i-her
face lit up with joy-sightless aged
crippled old iska i alone know it is to
happen    ask any boon for this great
gift kioga

  some other time mother he said
but tell this to no living soul kioga
admonished mysteriously the more cer-
tainly to insure a wide broadcast of all
he had confided

  then leaving excited iska kioga re-
turned without misadventure to his ca-
noe and hurried downstream toward the

caldrons approaching chieftains head
on foot from its one accessible side

  along the broad ledge that simulates
a human brow and in the hollows so
like eyes he heaped a pile of brush and
firewood ready to be kindled with a
spark that done he returned again to
his forest cave found all there well and
had four hours of sleep before the morn-
ing dawned

rising with the sun kioga woke
 ohali broke fast on fruit and some
acorn-cakes smuggled from hopeka and
told him of his activities iska knows
that you are alive iska will tell the
whole village the people will await the
coming of two-star back to this earth
and then it will be the turn of kansa
and inkato to shiver in their blankets
but poor ohali did not seem to feel en-
thusiastic and to lighten his fears kioga
took down a book from a covered shelf
this and many other volumes he had
salvaged from the cabin of a sinking
hulk off the seashore and from it he
read to ohali a tale of sherwood forest
translating the english as best he could
for ohali thus also had mokuyi done
when teaching kioga to read and speak
english the mother tongue and hear-
ing the strange stories of an unknown
civilized world ohali calmed again

  then kioga put the book aside and
after a moment of silence asked hast
ever seen a river-yei ohali

  no answered the shoni boy but
they look like men with devils heads
so my father told me

  and hands webbed like a ducks and
great brown spots upon their bodies
added kioga reflectively

  have you seen one  asked ohali cu-
riously

  no said kioga though i have
poked long poles in every river-hole seek-
ing to bring one forth

  ohalis eyes grew great you dared
-do that

  aki was with me explained kioga
together we fear nothing and tomor-
row continued kioga the shoni will
see a river-yei now listen well ohali
rounder still grew ohalis great dark
eyes as the snow hawk spoke and
when kioga had done i dare not-i
dare not whispered ohali pale with
fear again

  if i am close behind ohali-then will
you dare

  ohalis fears grew less return to home
and family in prospect and with the
one against

snow hawk his ally yes-yes he
said at last

  good little warrior commended ki-
oga now watch

  og a buckskin he drew the outlines of
his hands and with a whetted knife cut
out four pieces and sewed the four to-
gether with needle of bone and sinew
thread into the shape of overlarge gloves
save that he left the fingers joined to-
gether like the toes of paddle-foot the
wild duck

  next from the wall he took down his
most hideous medicine-mask fringed
about the open neck with human hair and
made to be worn upon the head like a
helmet then taking deer-grease in a
small stone cup he added to it reddish
earthy pigment mixing the two together

  these several adjuncts to his ambi-
tious schemes he wrapped up in a
deer-skin fastening the bundle to the
shoulders of faithful aki then he set
leisurely forth whip in belt and ohali
by his side toward his canoe

  along the way aki guardian of their
every previous step roamed off the trail
lured by some vagrant scent or other
where the forest paths were open ohali
walked beside kioga in tangled places
the snow hawk lifted him easily in his
arms moving by leaps and bounds if he
were no weight at all now and then
he dropped from cliff to bough while
ohali hung tightly on certain that they
must plummet far to earth

  but nothing like that happened im-
possible places passed easily beneath his
knowing feet and once indeed they took
six long drops in quick succession but
by now ohali knew no further fear and
enjoyed the swift exhilarating descent

  almost to the river grave hazard
growled fiercely at them from a trail-side
cave with back-laid ears and lashing
tail a great snow-leopard appeared

  were aki here he had not dared ven-
ture forth now unmenaced in anoth-
er instant he would spring and rend

ohali standing mesmerized by the
golden cats fire-circled stare was
struck rigid with terror not so kioga

  before the brute was halfway cut he
flicked his length of leather whip behind
him then with a move too quick for
eye to follow the long lash slithered for-
ward beneath the leopards hanging
jaw the hissing whang-strip barked like
an exploded pistol then twice again-
crack i crack-the long lash made the
fur fly up

a wilderness	

  checked in full intent to spring the
stung leopard arched up its spine and
hissing like any common alley cat broke
ground before the baffling thong one
more resounding whack and the brute
turned and when the lash flicked forth
again the beast was gone

  gone too in another moment were
kioga and ohali who reached the canoe
without further incident aki foupd them
there delivered up his shoulder pack
and when the little craft turned down-
river swam powerfully close behind

  when they had gone a little way ki-
oga let the craft drift of its own volition
and reaching into the bundle took forth
the deer-fat paint he had mixed n the
cave handing it to ohali

  now paint me he said so that if
any yei should see me he would come
and call me brother

in hopeka events transpired as kioga
had hoped as always the hopeka
women paused to visit a while with the
poor blind iska human clearing-house
of village information

  unable to contain her wondrous secret
the aged crone let slip-a word here
a word there-the burning rumor kioga
had confided to her

  the village women filled with wonder
told other women in strictest confidence
the eyes of mialoka will burn tonight i
to those who doubted iska told me
they said by way of proof the gossip-
pot boiled up the lid blew off like
swift wildfire then the news flew round
ohali was in truth said iska the son of
first-chief come humbly back to earth
in the guise of a minor chieftains child
ohalis mother hearing grew faint

  corn-cakes burned meals grew cold 
clothing went unmended

  and in his lodge cruel inkato and
kansa his confederate ill as men could
ever be lay groaning on the floor an
hour passed before they recovered from
the effects of kiogas potpourri

  kansa going to the door returned with
tidings that made inkatos own blood
flow swiftly once again the village
folk are rising there is a wondrous
stir strange rumors are afloat iska
spreads them even now- tis said ohali
is not mortal child but the son of the
first-chief mialoka

  up to his feet sprang inkato quiver-
ing to vague apprehensions they looked
at one another quick knives and
tomahawks mayhap even now we have
waited too long


the blue book magazine

  inkato quivered recalling ohalis
warrior-brothers his chieftain father
and all those eager knives that waited

  but he was quick to recover a measure
of his composure come he said to
kansa let us look and listen and
learn what is going on

  to accomplish that the shamans had
but to follow the crowd in their own
canoe downriver

  along the broad hiwasi the village
canoes had gathered thickly filled with
indians from hopeka no torch yet
blazed above the curving prows all was
dusk within shadow there came the
click and buzz of whispered conversa-
tion  hundreds of dark eyes fastened
upon a distant lofty point-the crown
of chieftains head above the caldrons
coming slowly into view

  the legend is come true the eyes
of mialoka burn 

  suddenly a cry of awe-the eyes far
overhead were lighting uncannily a
halo glowed about the rocky mist-draped
crown smoke poured from the stony
lips it was the sign the portent of some
great happening which blind old iska
had foretold

  bemused enthralled by wonder the
shoni saw the burning eyes grow dim
the fiery chaplet fade against the sky

  the prow- and helmsmen breathed up-
on their punk-wood tinder preparing
as the last glow dimmed on chieftains
head they fanned their sparks to flame
and lit the smoking torchlights stem
and stern for thus had blind old iska
earlier counseled them to do

  quivering shadows wriggled on the
coaly waters the river dark before
became a sea of yellowish light save
where a rocky point threw ebon shade
from shore to shore

then something pale and ghostly
seemed to float from nowhere the
outlines of a small canoe were seen with-
in a dimly gleaming figure knelt as
the craft came slowly forward this was
seen to be a youth in full regalia forth
from the gloomy shades his craft of
beauty came-canoe of birch-bark white
as snow forward knelt the figure robed
in frosty cloud and as the torchlights
illumined him his gala raiment seemed
on fire

  wide-eyed and open-mouthed the
watchers stared bedazzled

  then some one sharp of eye saw and
recognized ohali-ohali tis he in-
deed  ohali is the son of mialoka 

  from behind ohali hitherto almost
unseen a crouching thing of horror reared
its goblin head-not head of man but
more like devil its hands seemed not
as common hands but webbed as if for
swimming its human body lithe and
muscular was mottled with great liver-
colorgcl spots no thing like this had
ever walked the earth before-yet chil-
dren among the assemblage well knew
it for the ogre with whose name women
frighten small offenders

  a yei-a river-yei they whispered
go not too near

while they watched the yei with
webbed hands propelled the snow-
white craft along pausing now and then
to jabber weirdly thus with its cargo
of comely youth and unearthly terror
the white canoe moved among the village
craft its white-clad youth half-smiled
its hideous ogre made furious clutching
passes ever and anon whereat the near-
est women screamed and shrank away

  but seeing that no harm befell a few
canoes drew nearer among them one
containing inkato and kansa

  as the shamans neared the foremost
figure in the white canoe whispered i
am afraid

  from behind him came an answer
fear not behold they look at us in
awe

  in the foremost canoe a stately figure
spoke with trembling hand outstretched
ohali my son we know not if you live
or are a spirit

  astern the goblin river-yei muttered
something the youth then spoke in
low tones-yet not one was there but
heard the words distinctly are you not
my father tenasi

  a cry of awe rose up miracle mir-
acle ohali the dumb has answered
ohalis tongue is loosened

  answering uncertainly tenasi said
once i called ohali my son but now
he returns from the caldrons whence
never human body returned before he
comes as the legend says the son of mia-
loka will return he comes back to life
as two-star none knew of this until
blind old iska foretold it

  astern the river-yei shook and choked
as in convulsion

  the yei cannot breathe well when
out of water a shoni mother whispered
to her son near by like fish they are
with gills

  then rose a warrior seated behind
tenasi and said as spokesman for his
one against a wilderness



brothers we are your earthly brothers
what happened to ohali 

  he was given to the yei came the
answer and gesturing toward the stern
one of their number brings me back to
you

  a great indrawn breath sounded among
the people the canoe containing inkato
and kansa moved slightly nearer both
shamans eyes were glued in fascination
upon the white-clothed figure whose face
grew deathly pale beneath that scrutiny

  ominous as distant thunder the voice
of the chief spoke again who gave
ohali to the river-yei

  still closer moved the shamans craft
rigid as an image sat the river-yei
watching their every move muttering
something he heard ohali repeat-sway-
ing where he sat-

  two men of wicked hearts

  name them came the fierce appeal
from tenasi the silent multitude
strained their ears to hear no sound
was audible save the distant cough of
prowling tiger

  the shamans craft was only spear-
length distant from the white canoe the
eyes of those within it bored into ohali
some there were who later said they
heard a voice then mutter courage
right or wrong ohali seemed to stiffen
though his voice fell to a whisper he
answered slowly the name of one
was-

  suddenly one in the craft so close be-
side him sprang up with frightful yell
and in his back-drawn hand a war-ax
gleamed ohali did not stir but gripped
the gunwales as if by some command

  in a voice like ice some one unknown
finished ohalis sentence pronouncing
the name he feared to utter kansa

kioga had sought only the disgrace
of kansa not the penalty of death
but now there was no choice he acted
to save ohalis life

  before the younger shaman could
strike kansa seemed to choke and wither
where he stood those close by could
hear a high-pitched twang and see an
arrow sticking through his neck then
kansa toppled limply into the river- and
as he sank the river-yei watched fixedly

  again the voice of tenasi who was
the other

  again ohali whispered the others
name-was inkato

  yala-il shrill and terrible rose that
cry from behind the chief out of the

another unique exploit of one against a

mouths of ohalis brothers quick
after him

   but inkato had acted swiftly already
swung his craft out into the current and
crouching somewhat forward presented
little target to the spears that glanced
the water all around

  though they might have caught up
with him it was seen to be unnecessary
-and dangerous the shaman raised a
startled yell slowly but inexorably the
currents were bearing him toward the
fate to which he had sent so many others
-straight to the caldrons of the yei

in the white canoe ohali swayed up
rose the river-yei to bolster him
ohali heard swift muffled words close at
his ear well done little brother
theyll trouble thee no more good-by

o	son of mialoka

  good-by answered ohali brokenly
and to the horror of the onlookers threw
impulsive arms about the yei ohali
never will forget

   hang on came kiogas final word
ohali gripped the gunwales tightly

   one spring a knifelike entry with little
 splash-that quickly the yei was gone
 beneath the surface the same surface
 which carried inkato away

   with beating heart ohali watched for
sign of him upon the water a minute
passed-another clutching the gun-
wales the boy went paler than before
then from somewhere in the shadows
near the bank there came a loud and
imperious call

  ahail aki aki-followed by a
whistle

   downstream like rat in sinking trap
inkato heard that call and glancing
shoreward saw a naked figure vanish
from the moons new light seeing in-
kato stared drop-jawed on one bare
hip he dimly saw the mark of salmons
tail then glancing upward he caught
a last view of chieftains head and stared
anew for where the fire had burned
the stony face had cracked the chief-
tain seemed to smile then mists en-
wrapped bewildered inkato and he was
seen no more

   ohali also heard that imperative sum-
mons and a bears answering call hear-
ing he smiled with happy recollection of
a strange exciting adventure

  but kioga the snow-hawk climbing
the rims and ledges above the caldrons
his face to the forest and the future
did not look back

in the arctic we kill polar bears and
the barren ground grizzly only for
museum specimens or because they
endanger our lives or the lives of our
dogs we may also kill them because
we need the meat for food or the skins
for clothing and camp equipment all
of which is preliminary to the statement
that the thirteen grizzlies and dozens of
polar bears that have fallen to my rifle
were killed for scientific or other good
reasons never for sport

  since polar bears live almost exclusive-
ly by hunting seals they are likely to
mistake arctic explorers and eskimo
hunters for seals and to attack them
upon that basis that is what makes
the polar bear in my opinion the most
dangerous beast of prey among the land
animals of the north american conti-
nent he is almost as large as a kodiak
bear and very few animals are his
superior in intelligence moreover his
cream-white fur is a protective coloring
against a background of ice or snow

  in my two books the friendly arc-
tic and my life with the eskimo
will be found a number of stories of en-
counters with polar bears perhaps the
most amazing experience was that in
which the bear hunted me

  it was my custom while looking for
game above the arctic circle to sit on
the top of a hill or a pressure-ridge of
ice for perhaps five minutes at intervals
of a mile or two and with elbows rest-
ing on my knees to sweep the horizon
with a powerful pair of binoculars thus
it was possible to see a caribou at a dis-
tance of three or four miles-and a polar
bear a mile away one day while travel-
ing along the coast east of the mackenzie
delta a yellowish spot perhaps a mile
out on the sea ice attracted my atten-
tion i kept my glasses trained on this
spot a long time but could see no move-
ment this however was not conclusive
proof that it was not a polar bear for
these animals are likely to sleep for
hours after a full meal

  carefully searching the tundra as well
as the sea ice with my binoculars i
finally came back to the place where the
yellowish spot should have been it had
disappeared that meant but one thing
the macmillan co new york

 meal ex-

 jing of

   in this department we print each
   month a group of true stories
   told by our readers first a
   famous explorer tells of his
   experiences with polar bears

it was a polar bear and he had finished
his nap

   for a mile offshore the ice was crushed
and broken where the wind had piled it
up against the land jagged ridges
sometimes forty feet high intersected
the chaotic mass here and there the sun
shone upon a million minarets of ice and
snow pinnacles raised themselves fifty
feet into the air carefully taking my
bearings on a mountain peak and one of
these pinnacles i hastened down to the
shore and out over the ice

  after proceeding what seemed to me
to be a mile i climbed a forty-foot ridge
and looked around for the bear he was
not in sight i then lined up another
ridge about a quarter of a mile farther
out to sea on the assumption that the
bear would be found somewhere beyond
that point if not it would be necessary
for me to travel in a large circle until i
came upon his trail

   i had finished looking over the ice
both with and  without my binoculars
and was actually clambering down from
my perch with my rifle in its sealskin
cover when i heard behind me a noise
something like the hiss of an angry
goose on a ridge about twenty feet dis-
tant and almost above me stood the
polar bear had i stayed on the ridge
five minutes longer there is every reason
to believe that he would have pounced
upon me in the belief that i was some
sort of seal by giving me warning
however he made it possible for me to
snatch my rifle from its cover and bring
him down

   the bears trail which i then picked
up told the following story i had over-
estimated the distance of the beast from
shore and had passed a little to the
windward of the spot where he lay on
getting my scent the bear had come up

perience

 wind to my trail and had followed it
 it had not occurred to me to look back
 i was so used to hunting polar bears that
 the possibility of one hunting me would
 have seemed preposterous

    on shorepolar bears are rather timid
 they are actually afraid of men dogs and
 wolves out on the drifting pack how-
 ever they have no enemy to fear in
 fact they are familiar with only three
 living things-the seal on which they
 live the white fox that scavenger of the
 arctic and the sea gulls which flutter
 about the polar bear after he has killed
 a seal the fox which is almost as much
 of a sea animal as the polar bear is un-
 able to provide his own living when on
 t the drifting ice so he follows the bear
 when a bear kills a seal he usually eats
 at least fifty pounds of the blubber and
 perhaps some of the meat then curls up
 behind an ice-cake and goes to sleep
 the foxes finish the carcass and after
 them come the gulls if the bear returns
 for another meal the foxes and gulls
 scatter to the four winds thus the polar
 bear gets the impression that these
 creatures are not dangerous but merely
 too crafty to be caught

    a polar bear is able to tell the differ-
 ence between a living seal and the car-
 cass when he sniffs the air traveling to
 leeward of a camp on the ice a polar
 bear is no doubt bewildered by the many
 strange odors that assail his sensitive
 nostrils there is however usually one
 familiar smell that of seal-meat-since
 every other living creature usually makes
 way for the polar bear he has no cause
 for fear and comes straight up wind into
 camp the dogs are usually tied at inter-
 vals of six or eight feet along a picket
 line and if one of them happens to get
 up and shake the snow out of his coat
 the bear is apt to conclude that here are

    
a   
  
some live seals after all his approach
becomes stealthy in the extreme but
eventually one of the dogs sees hears or
smells the bear and begins to bark

  this is the signal for all the dogs to
leap up and start barking the bear
hesitates judging from his actions on
such an occasion he thinks the dogs are
just another kind of fox and therefore
beneath his contempt his keen sense
of smell however reminds him there is
seal-meat in the camp and he continues
his approach openly and fearlessly by
that time the commotion has awakened
one of us and a properly placed bullet
ends the story

on a day late in march six of us
traveling by dog-team over the ice
between alaska and banks land were
halted by a narrow lead of open water
three or four seals were killed for both
men and dogs and one member of the
party set about making a blubber-burn-
ing stove from a provision-tin our two
rifles were cleaned and put in their cases
and we were cooking seal-meat with the
blubber from the same animal when we
were brought to our feet by a great com-
motion among the dogs they were still
hitched to the sleds at the edge of the
ice some fifty feet distant the man
nearest them ran to stop what we
thought from past experience was a dog-
fight three of us followed but turned
back to the fire when it seemed that our
assistance would not be needed before
we reached our seats we heard a shout
its a bear

  the voice had an ominous ring as if
the polar bear had reached the dogs and
was killing them one at a time with a
single blow of his powerful forepaws if
that were the case we would have to
haul our heavy sleds back to shore-and
that would take weeks we leaped to
our feet therefore and rushed with one
accord to where the two rifles lay on the
sleds arriving at the spot we found
that the great danger was not that the
bear would attack the dogs but that the
dogs would pull the sleds into the water
in their eagerness to get at the bear-in
which case we would lose everything

  while two members of the party re-
strained the dogs and two of us grabbed


	real experiences

our rifles the fifth man armed himself
with our ice-spear-and the sixth begged
us not to shoot until he had obtained a
photograph of the magnificent specimen
which stood on the opposite side of the
open water not more than thirty feet
distant apparently the bear was not in
the least afraid of the dogs-or of us
the dogs tugged at their harness and
barked and we yelled warnings to one
another but the bear seemed to consider
us just another species of seal he stood
facing us at the edge of the opposite
ice-field quite unconcerned looking into
the water and swinging his head as if he
were trying to decide whether to plunge
in and swim across

  at this critical moment the bears left
foreleg was knocked completely out from
under him by a -d bullet from my
companions rifle the bear was so close
to the edge that he tumbled into the icy
water standing on the opposite edge
we could see evidences of a mighty strug-
gle in the gray-green depths would he
be driven into an insane fury by the bul-
let wound clamber out on our side and
cut a swath among us-and the dogs-
before he could be dispatched

  by that time i had reached my rifle-
case the bear came to the surface ap-
parently with no thought whatever of
visiting our camp as he clambered out
on the opposite side his only thought
evidently was to escape but the bear
was wounded and it would be better to
end his misery both of us fired and
both bullets took effect but the bear dis-
appeared behind a pressure-ridge before
we could fire again

  during the excitement the ice-fields
practically came together and two of
the men with camera and rifle crossed
and took up the broad trail of blood
within half a mile they sighted the bear
limping along also the bear saw them
and immediately dived into the nearest
open water it should have been a
simple matter for the man carrying the
- to put a bullet in a vital spot
when the bear came to the surface but
after i heard three shots it seemed to
me that a harder-shooting rifle was
needed so i took up the trail came up-
on the bear and killed him with a bullet
through the heart as he clambered out
onto the ice

  standing at the edge of another lead
early one morning with two companions
i noticed a polar bear swimming in the
open water ice had begun to form but
it was not yet strong enough to bear his

weight it was however too thick to al-
low him to swim on the surface the
bear therefore would paddle along for
eight or ten yards apparently until he
became tired of breaking his way through
the young ice then make a dive he
would swim under water for about
twenty yards then come up for air
breaking his way through and resting his
forelegs upon the ice while he looked
about he would again paddle a few
yards then dive

  in this fashion he finally reached pur
camp he stood on the heavy floe
sniffing then came toward us at a leisure-
ly walk up to this time the dogs had
not discovered the bears presence but
now with the animal in plain sight they
began to bark furiously the bear was
not disconcerted in the least by the ter-
rific uproar his sense of smell told him
that there was seal-meat in the offing and
he immediately headed for it paying no
attention whatever to us or the dogs
when he was in a convenient spot for
skinning i fired

on another occasion when we were
returning to our base camp some
four hundred and fifty miles to the south-
ward my two companions and i pitched
our tent about fifteen yards from the
open water suddenly one member of
the party stopped to examine closely
what he thought was a piece of ice drift- 
ing along about two hundred yards from
the tent when it seemed to him that
the ice was drifting too rapidly he
picked up his binoculars to see what it
really was as he was focusing them up-
on the object it disappeared beneath the
surface-and reappeared a little nearer
camp we were being stalked by a
polar bear

  the three of us got our rifles and two
of us took up positions behind the sleds
the third man stayed with the dogs
apparently the bear had sighted them
sleeping in a row on the ice and had con-
cluded that they were seals basking in
the warm sunshine his patience was
remarkable he would swim slowly back
and forth occasionally lifting his head a
little to see if the seals were still there
but the dogs slept peacefully on and
this in itself should have warned the
bear for a seal takes only short naps
and frequently raises his head to look
about for his natural enemy

  finally the bear maneuvered to a spot
nearly opposite the camp raised his
forepaws upon the ice and hauled him-
king of the north	

self out of the water he made no sound
and moved with incredible swiftness in
fact he was within ten feet of my com-
panion before he could fire the bear
turned a complete somersault still
headed in our direction my companion
again pulled the trigger but it would not
budge his rifle was jammed at this
rather critical juncture and without en-
dangering my companions life i was
able to get in a shot with my  the
bear rolled over dead so close that we
could almost touch him

  eskimos once assured me with great
solemnity that polar bears and other
animals are much wiser than men

  why then do they allow themselves
to be killed by eskimo hunters i
asked

  they informed me that there are cer-
tain things that polar bears and seals
need-things which they can get only
from men seals and whales for example
live in salt water and get quite thirsty
when they want a drink of fresh water
they have to come to men for it a seal
therefore will allow himself to be killed
by a hunter who will give him a drink
of water in return that is why an eski-
mo pours a dipper of water into the
mouth of a seal when he brings it ashore
if a hunter neglects to do this all the
other seals will find it out and no other
seal will ever allow himself to be killed
by that particular hunter because he
knows he will not get a drink 

  the polar bear i was told does not
suffer from thirst as much as seals be-
cause he can get fresh water on top of
the ice-water that is formed by the
suns action upon snow he can also eat
snow but say the eskimos polar bears
nevertheless are dependent to some ex-
tent upon men they are unable to make
for themselves certain tools which they
need when therefore a polar bear has
been killed his soul accompanies the
skin into the hunters house and stays
there for several days during this time
the skin is hung up in the house together
with the tools which the bear needs at
the end of the fourth or fifth day ac-
cording to the eskimos the soul-f the
bear is driven out of the house it takes
with it the souls of the tools which have
been suspended with it and uses them
thereafter if during those days the
bears soul has been treated as an
honored guest if it has received the
souls of implements of good quality then
it will report these things in the land of
the polar bears to which it returns and

other bears will be not only willing but
anxious to be killed by an eskimo hunt-
er of such integrity

  be that as it may i shall continue to
believe that polar bears are not in search
of tools but fresh meat when they enter
a camp take for example the bear
that made a rather dramatic approach
to our tent out on the drifting pack my
two companions were about a quarter of
a mile distant at the time and our dogs
were strung out as usual far enough
apart to keep them from fighting i was
standing on a hummock searching the
surface of the ice with my glasses sud-
denly i saw a polar bear advancing
toward the camp at a steady walk at
almost the same instant he caught sight
of the dogs he began to stalk them as
he would a seal-he thrust out his head
laid his lower jaw on the ice and pro-
pelled himself along like a toboggan

my one thought was to save the dogs
and prevent us from being stranded
hundreds of mrles from the nearest land
thinking i might attract the bears at-
tention away from them i shouted this
however merely drew the attention of
the dogs toward me and away from the
bear which continued to advance even
when he reached a hummock about
twenty yards from the dogs they had no
warning of his presence

  the bear partly raised himself from
the ice ready for his customary dash
in a moment he would be upon the dogs
and when he found they werent seals
after all it would be too late i was
more than a hundred yards away and
badly out of breath from my dash over
the rough ice but i took aim and fired
the bullet in some way seemed to
paralyze the bears spine for his fore-
legs doubled beneath him as he slid
backward his hind-legs also crumpled

  i approached keeping my rifle ready
the bears eyes followed every move-
ment of mine he was very much alive
but bleeding profusely then before i
could quite make up my mind to finish
him with a bullet through the heart he
launched himself directly at me with-
out the slightest preparation or warn-
ing but experience with polar bears
had taught me to be wary my rifle was
ready and as the bear leaped i pulled
the trigger the bullet pierced the
brain it was a narrow escape for by
the time the bear collapsed he was so
close-less than six feet-that his blood
spattered upon my boots
job for cjfiunston

     racy i want a report on the
narrow-gauge railroad up to japa-
la how much of it if any is torn
up whether or not the bridges are blown
and if so the best place on the streams
for fording artillery and wagon-trains
its a tough job but must be done you
will be within the mexican lines from
the minute you pass el tejar the ma-
rine outpost good-by and good luck
general frederick funston gave me
these orders in his office in the terminal
building at vera cruz mexico 
intelligence-that was my job and of
all the dirty dangerous poorly paid and
unrewarded work i ever did that was it

  i checked out through the marine
lines at el tejar shortly after dark
for the first mile or two i would have
to make my way througlf the swamps to
get around the mexican outposts after
that i would have to stick ta the rail-
way which was also the main highway
for mexican troops patrolling the coun-
try what would happen if i were cap-
tured by mexican soldiers would not
stand telling for i was listed as a de-
serter from the mexican army

  dont carry much of an outfit do
you captain hughes asked

  plenty i told him forty-five
automatic knife field-glasses flash-
light hundred capsules of quinine six
clips for the forty-five and half a pound
of tobacco

  before morning i had covered ten
miles of track then i holed up for the
day under the roots of a banyan tree
and trusted to luck   

  it took me five days to cover the rail-
way to jalapa but i had every tie and
rail labeled as well as several mexican
camps along the route i had also care-
fully cut the wires to a mine that was
planted under a bridge all the bridges
may have been mined but that was the
only one i could get to as they were all
guarded by soldiers

  on the return trip i reversed the pro-
cedure i traveled by day keeping in
sight of the railway but as far back in
the bush as possible traveling through
the bush was pure hell as i could not
follow any established road or trail i
never knew when i was going to run



into natives or native houses the na-
tives were inoffensive but there was al-
ways the chance that they would talk

  i had taken so much quinine that my
head was ringing and my body was one
mass of sores from the bites of ticks
thousands of little seed ticks no larger
than a pin-head when they landed on
you but growing to the size of a bean
with a days feeding my main danger
or so i thought was from patrols of
federal soldiers and there were plenty
of them scouring the country only a
few days before two sailors had ridden
past the outposts and were never seen
again

  i came to a large clearing in the bush
to cross it was half a mile to go
around meant at least three miles of
bush-dodging and i was getting mighty
well fed up i was sick and hungry and
my luck had been so good that i decided
to take a chance

  sometime later the crowing of chick-
ens indicated a house so i decided to
look it over and if it appeared safe to
try for something to eat it had been
twenty-four hours since i had last tasted
food and that only a poorly roasted
iguana    while still some distance
away i heard the piercing screams of a
woman as i ran the screaming in-
creased and then i came out into a
small clearing around a native thatched
hut in front of the house a woman was
struggling fiercely in the clutches of a
scarecrow of a man she was fighting
silently the screams were coming from
inside the hpuse

  my presence went unnoticed until i
knocked the man in the head with my
pistol then the woman just folded up
i jumped to the door of the hut and
faced a sight that made my blood boil
and my pistol fairly to leap in my hand

  when the american forces landed in
vera cruz they seized the old fortress
prison of san juan dfel uloa this in-
famous prison built on an island in the
harbor of vera cruz was the worst
prison irt mexico probably in the new
world now some misguided officer re-
leased nearly all the prisoners

  no doubt they were enough to excite
sympathy political prisoners and the
a noted soldier of fortune tells of a desperate
adventure while serving as an intelligence officer

by tracy richardson

worst criminals were the ones confined
on the island to be sentenced to uloa
was generally regarded as a death-sen-
tence the average prisoner living less
than five years it was said they were
ill-fed ragged covered with vermin and
never permitted to shave

  part of the cells of uloa are built or
rather dug out of the coral foundations
at high tide the water rises from two to
five feet in these dank dungeons i had
served in the north of mexico with
colonel cesar canallas who had served
two years in san juan del uloa a polit-
ical prisoner and he had told me plenty
of tales about the horrors of this prison

  after thipgs had quieted down the
americans realized the mistake they had
made in liberating these desperate pris-
oners but it was too late for most pf
them had fled the city and taken to the
bush where they robbed and killed with
the joy of maniacs

inside the room i saw three men un-
shaven ragged and as dirty specimens
as it would be possible to imagine one
look at them and i knew i was faced
with escapees from uloa prison mad
dogs on a cow-hide bed was another
woman held at head and feet by two of
the men

  i fired three times with my forty-five
and thanked god that i was an expert
with a pistol when i removed one of
the bodies which had fallen across the
woman she fell to the floor and kissed
my feet

  then as she drew herself up i saw
a look of stark terror freeze her ex-
pression with a leapt whirled to meet
the new danger i was face to face with
the man i had downed in the yard he
missed me with a swing of his machete
and another shot closed the career of
the last of the four thugs they would
commit no more crimes	

  i dragged the bodies outside and tried
to comfort the women i told them i
was hungry and they served my wants
with a pitiful eagerness placing before
me tortillas beans and eggs all they
had their father and husband was
away at a near-by town with a cargo of
chickens and would be home that night

 no one knows how good beans and
tortillas can taste until he is really hun-
gry i put away a good feed and was
stretching out for a rest when one of the
women hearing a noise outside went tci
the door

 the soldiers are coming she said
sure enough entering the edge of the
clearing was a squadron of about twenty
mounted federal soldiers that was
enough for me i dashed out the back
way and made for the bush on the
dead run as i left the clearing a couple
of bullets cut close to me and i heard
the soldiers shouting i fairly flew for
a few minutes i heard no sound of pur-
suit then i heard calls and the sound
of crashing bushes as the soldiers
searched for me i kept on the run in
the general direction of el tejar which
was still several miles distant

  i ran until i could stand it na longer
i could hear sounds of searchers behind
and ahead of me it looked as if it was
hopeless i came out into one of those
open spaces where nothing grows but
a patch of cactus i crawled on my
belly into the shelter of the thorn
bushes every move i made i was
pricked by the spines but i kept at it
until i was in the center of the cactus
patch there i tried to rest the cac-
tus-patch was also the home of countless
ants no sooner had i settled down than
they swarmed over me ants by the
hundreds in my hair in my ears and
nose biting and crawling

 furiously i chewed tobacco the
juice i smeared over my face neck and
hands then as much as i could over my
body the tobacco juice helped but
the ants still made life miserable for
me to lie still meant ants to move
meant cactus thorns to leave the place
meant capture and sure death at the
hands of the federal soldiers  i
lay there until sundown and then
worked my way out

i was as near desperate as a man
could get and still retain his senses i
gave over all thought of concealment
and made directly for the railway

a job for funston

darkness fell before i reached the rails
and then it began to rain it poured
down in torrents but the cool water re-
lieved my burning skin through the
blinding storm i made my way down
the track toward el tejar half a mile
from the american outposts was a
mexican guard they were all under
cover and i passed without challenge
i knew then that i was getting near the
american point sentry i whistled and
used my flash-light to give warning that
i was coming i doubted if i could be
heard above the storm

  i stumbled as my foot missed a slip-
pery cross-tie something snatched my
hat from my head then i heard the
whiplike crack of a rifle and a loud
challenge halt who goes there

  i let out a yell that but for the rain
could have been heard in vera cruz six
miles away the sentry was not over
fifteen feet away and but for my fall
would have killed me i was held at
bayonet-point until an excited sergeant of
the guard came on the double i could
hardly blame the sentry for not recog-
nizing me as a white man

  i spent the rest of the night under the
ministrations f two hospital orderlies
having the ticks dug out and iodine
painted over my cuts and bites

  next morning i reported to general
funston giving him my map with all
details of the railway and rivers

  thats fine tracy said the gen-
eral glad you got back ive another
job for you i want you to fly over that
country in one of the naval planes and
make photographs well need them
when we advance

  a few days later i was called to el
tejar there i met a mexican officer
and an old man-the father and hus-
band of the two women i had saved
from the convicts when the officer saw
me he threw his arms around me in a
latin embrace-he was an old friend
of mine from the red flag revolution

  colonel i might have known that
you would be doing this kind of work
that shooting looked like your mark
for the service you did the mexican
government the other day you will no
longer be called a deserter you are
our friend even though we may be
fighting on opposite sides

  he gave me a pass permitting me to
go through all mexican lines in the
vicinity of vera cruz but i never got
an opportunity to use it a few days
later i was on my way to france

  after fighting several successful bouts
staged for the amusement oj the bored
miners at cobalt ex-soldier mclaglen
decides to become a professional fighter

im a boxer now and fight all the local
champions i meet a former naval
officer and i engage him for my
manager

  our first fight is arranged at port
arthur a backwoods kind of lawless
town my manager gets drunk and im
awfully ashamed i never drank a drop
until i was thirty i felt he was show-
ing me up in this place so the next
rrtorning in the dining-room i tell him

  youre taking advantage of me be-
cause im younger were through you
are not connected with me in this busi-
ness any longer he turns around
catches up a bottle of water and throws
it at me i hit him and he fell to the
floor against the radiator he had to
have his eye out and im sent to jail

  a man bailed me out he had come to
the fight the night before and wished me
luck  i found out hed been a noted
safe-blower he told me how he did it
   funny thing-i-had boxed my way
around the world when i met this fellow
again at melbourne australia he had
become a well-known business man

  another strange reunion happened
when i was filming what price glory
in hollywood we were doing the war
sequence with all the soldiers making a
charge on the hill some one behind me
said captain if you ever want a handy
man dont forget me i turned around
and saw a familiar face

  arent you my ex-manager yes
there he was with the glass eye i had
caused him to wear working as an extra
on our lot a few weeks later i gave
him his fare to vancouver where he
wanted to go

  before i left the north american con-
tinent i had earned the title of cham-
pion of eastern canada when the
profits of fighting ran low i joined medi-
cine and wild west shows once i was

featured on the pantages vaudeville cir-
cuit in a wrestling act    went back
to vancouver to fight jack johnson in a
no-decision bout

  then the wanderlust gripped me again
 i boxed my way to hawaii the fiji
islands tahiti and australia-did a
little gold-rush mining at kalgoorlie
and went on from there to ceylon and
bombay i instructed the rajah of
arcat india in boxing-taught him to
punch the bag at night he would tell
me stories once he graphically described
how his parents were poisoned a few
years later i picked up a paper and read
that the rajah had been poisoned too

  when the world war was declared i
wasfinally paying my first visit home in
south africa where my father was then
stationed as colonial bishop all my
brothers had arrived in england from
the four corners in a few days they
were headed for different parts of the
british front i was made a full lieu-
tenant and sent to mesopotamia

  we had a number of exciting engage-
ments with the turks and arabs and
finally were hemmed in on the peninsula
at bagdad we barb-wired it i was
made provost marshal in charge of mili-
tary and police all the passes were is-
sued by me all the shipments that came
up the river were confiscated by me i
took charge of all the towns around bag-
dad which consisted of half a million
arabs jews mohammedans christians

fighting is fighting no matter where
it is nothing thrilling in seeing arabs
digging up the dead to get blankets
nothing thrilling either in eating rotten
rations and drinking putrid water the
only thrill was in seeing wonderful old
bagdad thp bazaars and streets the
colorful costumes the barbaric drums
the call to prayers the solemn caravans
of camels presented as fantastic a world
as any described in a thousand and
one nights what man would be im-
mune to temptation and to romance in
such a setting

she was the only daughter of a fam-
ily of high caste and wealth who lived
a few doors away from the great twelve-
room house i called home i went to her
home to dine often from her barred
window over the big front door she
waited-and watched for me

  i was preparing to marry and settle
down in this paradise    the natives
loved me and feared me too and
this gentle grave race made strange ap-
peal to me i went to england to be
mustered out and return to bagdad

  but neither bagdad nor his arabian
sweetheart ever saw the english sahib
again on the same ship to england
with him went his future brother-in-law
through him he met the woman who
became his wife

  after the war when london was an
economic desert i tried to get back in
the boxing game one fight was enough
to prove to me that i had stayed away
too long to come back i was pondering
on what to do next when one night in
the national sporting club in london
i attracted the notice of an important
british film producer i b davidson

  he asked if i would like to be filmed

  im not an actor i told him never
desired to be and dont think i could be

  davidson invited me to go out to the
studio and make a test they were film-
ing the call of the wild and they
offered me forty pounds a week to play
the male lead i accepted that pic-
ture turned out to be one of the biggest
hits of the time and i was starred for
four years before stuart blackton brought
me to hollywood

  my first talky black watch was
bad the critics put me at the top of
the list of people expected to be elimi-
nated by the new medium but i fought
it through

  thats the reason the academy of mo-
tion picture arts and sciences award i
won for the informer role is so
precious to me i feel like a boy who
tried to pass an examination and failed
and by perseverance succeeded


zjyty at ea

the morning after we were past old
stiff we set the royals again hoist-
ing the fore royal i pulled forehand
pulling straight down upon the halyard
fall the fall passed through a block
upon the deck the others pulling length-
wise on it and just when the sail was
almost up the fall gave way and the
heavy wooden block dropped on my head
from many feet above

  when i came to i was in a chair and
the skippers wife was washing my split
head it was a nasty wound and i felt
deathly sick i staggered as i walked
but theres scant mercy in a ship at sea
if i had been a lad ashore i should have
been in bed maybe in hospital i kept
the deck and early in the night clegg
shouted hop up and loose the cross-
jack two of you  i was the nearest to
the rigging so up i went and god
knows how i did it i could not see a
thing clegg shouted cant you move
up there wake up are you asleep
i loosed my half of the sail and crawled
down somehow you take what comes
at sea its part of being a sailor   

  while we climbed the long hill to
the equator kylon the finn grew ever
more strange hed sit alone at night
and talk who are you talking to
clegg asked one night

  i speaks mitt mein goot vren sir
he doesnt answer you  asked clegg
and kylon said yow bat he talk
me mitt sir

  sometimes hed lie upon the sea-wet
deck and writhe and call aloud a
womans name he took to eating ever
less and less his huge frame wasted
the mates were kindly the old man
said youll see that no one troubles
that poor mad fellow there was no
need for him to say it

  one day i came well nigh to hating
clegg hed often tried me sorely by
picking for me all the hardest jobs aloft
and now he gave me a small pot of gilt
paint and a paint-brush hop up and
gild the trucks  he ordered me-as
though to gild a truck were just as
simple as to go picking roses

  there was no wind the ship was
pitching like a hurdling horse to a long
nigh steep-sided swell one minute her

stem would lift almost clear of the
water her bows go soaring up next
instant down her bow would go until
the water gurgled to her forecastle head
you scarce could walk along the deck for
her wild pitching and when a mans
aloft its pitching that he feels far
worse than rolling

  the highest part of a ships mast is
called the pole it goes up from where
the rigging ends up to the topmost sum-
mit a tall pole finishes a ship with per-
fect symmetry our poles were ten feet
long and since there is no rigging on the
pole you have to go up monkey-fashion
the pole ends at the truck a rounded
wooden ball and our trucks were kept
gilded-a last fancy touch

 so up i started and knowing i had
a dizzy job to do began to tremble the
vertigo was back was my time come at
last  i passed the place whence long ago
furst fell from and i went on the
pole looked like a mile i clenched my
teeth and started up it monkey-fashion
once when she took a wild pitch i
thought my time was come and almost
yelled a hundred and ninety feet be-
low the deck was awaiting me some-
how i gilded that fore truck i dont
know how and down i went and
when i reached the solid deck there
wasnt any peace because i knew i had
to gild three more ere i was done and
up i went again the same thing over on
the mainmast and down i came again
i was half done and as i started up the
mizzenmast i saw the old man on the
poop near by and he saw me he didnt
see my fear because i didnt let him
to brace myself i sang

toms gone what shall i do

        hilo hilo

where toms gone i must go too

        toms gone to hilo

 and hearing me the old man called
you quit that singing and get on
with your work  so then f ran despite
my blurry eyes my horrid fear i went
up like a frightened monkey determined
that he should not guess my fear i saw
the old devil eying me when i came
down and went up to the poop to start to
climb the jigger mast he saw me shaking

a famous writer here brings his
fascinating story of seafaring to
its dramatic conclusion

by bill adams

  whats the matter boy he asked
i said im trying to see how fast
sir i can gild the trucks im out of
breath a bit

  he said you see you gild em prop-
erly and dont miss any place 

  though shorter than the other masts
the jigger is the worst for it has a
longer pole but up i went and down i
came at last i leaned against the mast
shaky-limbed-and clegg said by gad
bill but youre fast youre a damned
handy sailor arent you eh

  so then i had to look at him and
laugh i saidr-if im a sailor its your
doing maybe sir

  he said oh no youve got the
breed in you old man

  that night clegg told me that he got
a wigging from the skipper for sending
anyone aloft to gild the trucks when she
was pitching so and i said to hell
with the skipper i got em gilded
didnt i whats all the growl about
and that was not all brag i loved clegg
then more than ever yet id loved him

  one night soon after that while we
was talking with him on the poop
clegg said by god bill i feel ill
he said he had a sort of weak all-over
feeling and next day he laid up and
chink took his watch we were a week
or two from frisco and everyone was
busy getting the ship into fancy dress
for port once more

we sailed in through the golden gate
one sunny afternoon and dropped the
hook the port was full of ships-a row
of ships at anchor along the water-
front a forest of tall masts and spread-
ing spars euphrosyne was there and
lllawarra melanope sorunna eurydice
oh i could name the names of sixty
ships but theyd mean naught to you

  a little distance from us lay a great
barque from maine wed heard of her
all sailors knew her well a brutal
yankee hell-wagon where men were
treated worse than any dogs ashore her
mates wore knuckle-dusters carried be-
laying-pins her skipper was a devil out
of hell god help the sailor who didnt
do his work no mercy for him and
did he do it mercy scant enough

  the minute wed our anchor down a
 boarding-master came aboard he went
 toward the forecastle where our crew
 were gone and on the way he met with
 kylon hello my hearty here have
 a drink on me

   and kylon sent the rot-gut bottle to
 his lips and took a long long swallow
 go on  drink hearty sailor thats
 the real stuff it warms a sailors blood
 when hes come round the horn so
 kylon tipped the bottle up again and
 then the boarding-master had him by the
 arm come on my lad ive got a
 dandy berth for you my bully boy 
 and brown the boarding-master took
 off that wasted fuddled finn to that
 hard hell-wagon he sold him to her
 skipper whod been waiting for one man
 to fill his crew and then she hove her
 anchor up and stood away to sea we
 never heard of kylon any more   

  we docked next morning and clegg
 was taken to a hospital he said to me
 so long youll come and see me eh
 yes sir i answered him

   lifting a feeble hand he said smiling
 to me cut out the sir old man were
 shipmates you and i

   and later he said the doctors tell
 me that my heart is crocky they say
 -that i can never-go to sea again
 and i cant tell you of the tone he said


	real experiences

those words in i felt ashamed of my
  reat strength before another sunday
  e was upon his way to liverpool

  the frisco waterfront was lovely in
those days you could walk for blocks
beneath the long jib-booms of clippers
stretched across the street youd see
their figureheads a dragon one ship
had its red maw open and its white
fangs showing and some had knights
or warriors with spears and swords
and shields and many ships had women
for their figureheads ours was the fair-
est figurehead of all a white-robed
woman with her white breast bare one
arm outstretched a finger pointing to the
far away and in her other hand she
held a long silver horn to her lips about
to blow on it that is the prettiest ship
of all youd hear the shore folk say
as they strolled along the waterfront

  and by and by the good day came
again when we were homeward bound
two other lofty clippers put to sea with
us all falmouth-bound when we hove
our anchor up we made the bay ring

     californias lovely daughters

    we must now bid you adieu

    but its long that well remember
    happy hours weve spent with you
    rolling home rolling home

       rolling home across the sea

      rolling home to merrie england

      to the land where we woidd be

  it was the same old song and dance as
usual wed see a ship and race and
leave her far astern wed shake the
maggots from the hard-tack and curse
the smelly pork but now the older ap-
prentices were grown more serious
chink polly tattersall and douglas
who was third mate would be out of
their time when we came home and so
they studied navigation in the dog-
watches next voyage thered be a lot
of green kids in the half-deck

  i mind a night far down in the pacific
i was asleep but paddy woke me up

  my god ive heard the banshee
paddy said his face white

  you silly fool get out of here get
out and go to hell and let me sleep i
laughed

  but paddy said you come on deck
and listen so i rolled out and fol-
lowed them

  you know whats meant by banshee
it is a ghost the irish talk about you
hear the silly thing and-well look out
the irish say it means youre going to
die the one who hears it first he dies

  the night was very dark with a low
wind the old girl sailing slowly on a
gentle sea with all sail set back to
bunk for me you crazy irish ass said
i and then i heard it we all heard
far away a sort of moaning sound and
as we stood there wondering what it was
the carpenter awakened by our voices
looked from his door

  you blasted fools its just a block
aloft as needs a grease dollop didnt
ye ever hear a dry block groaning
chink said its whales of course
and we all laughed we never gave it
any thought again not even paddy did
he said i guess i was a fool bill
we stopped at pitcairn and filled our
bellies with its fruits again we drove
her toward the horn the mountain
seas came rolling after her the snowy
albatross hovered above her rail we
met an outbound ship one howling day
hove to she was our brave fair wind
her head wind we saw the seas go
crashing over her and pitied her crew
at dog-watch time that night we sang

  weve crossed the line and the gulf
    stream 

      been down by table bay

  weve rounded the horn and were home-
    ward-bound

       and that is the sailors way

  and by and by we came to the sunny
seas and bright blue skies again

  i came down from the mast one day at
noon to go off duty the mates watch
came on deck the ship was still upon
a windless sea no whitecap anywhere
no cloud in all the south atlantic sky
her sails hung drooping high high
above her mastheads i could see a soli-
tary marlinespike bird  a white bird with
a long white tail feather i just could
hear its screaming and far away a pod
of whales was spouting entering the
half-deck for my dinner i met paddy in
the doorway it was sunday he said
my harriet lane is in your plate bill
and i said all right paddy thanks
chink and the farmers son obrien
and i sat wearily down to our dinner
we had been working hard all morning

  and suddenly there dame a shrilling
scream all terror in it and up we
leaped and out we rushed before man
overboard had even ceased its ringing
the crew were racing for the boat it
wasnt necessary to stop the ship for
she was utter still on that limpid sea

  i sprang into the jigger-rigging and
raced up clear to the truck thats what
my life at sea

t

one man must always do if anyone goes
overboard by day you go up there and
thence direct the lifeboat toward the man
whos in the sea i looked all round the
still blue limpid sea the rowers in the
boat looked up at me the sea was
empty i heard that birds faint scream
the whales were gone and soon i said
cool as though it didnt matter in the
least another poor devil gone then
down i came the boat was in beside
the ship and they were hoisting her and
since i wasnt needed i went to the
half-deck to finish my harriet lane
and by the door i met with chink i
asked  who was it 

  chink said paddy

  it didnt bother me at all at first i
ate his harriet lane and put my plate
away then i walked forward to the
hammock hed risen from a little time
ago the dent of his head was in the
pillow still i laid my head there and
i went to sleep and then-i wakened
suddenly and i was running from be-
neath the forecastle head and in my
ears there rang man overboard i and
that was how it was for days many
times id wake find myself running
that cry in my ears

that evening in the dog-watch i sat
alone out on the rail thinking of
my chum polly came to me come
on old chap were going to have a
sing-song in the half-deck and how
i hated him and all my comrades a
sing-song with paddy being nibbled by
the barracout i turned away presently
i noted that there was no singing i rose
and went to the half-deck chink polly
tattersall were poring over navigation
books the younger lads sat silent
smoking chink looked up and want
a fill old man he asked and pifshed
his baccy-pouch toward me and polly
fumbled in his pocket for a match tat-
tersall said  curses i cant get my
giddy figures right tonight and then
i knew-that they only thought to have
a sing-song thinking to cheer me up so
i sat down and filled my pipe and
smoked and no one spoke the ship
lay silent on the listless sea the dark-
ness hid her over her tall masts the
stars shone bright and by and by her
bells clanged the lookout-man cried
alls well sir and the lights are
bright

  the mate replied all right

  then i recalled my fathers voice
 youll find it a hard hje my son

  and then i went to the wheel and
stood there my two hours and thought
of paddy i seemed to see his smile to
hear him singing that paradise alley
song and somewhere far below me
were the barracout   

  a wind blew up that night the mates
watch took the royals off her and when

i	came on duty soon after dawn the
wind was gone again only a little
breeze was blowing and presently the
second mate sang out loose the
royals and when that order came i
was beside the foremast alone no other
near me and when an order comes the
man whos nearest to the rigging goes
aloft to carry out that order and so
from force of habit and of duty i
climbed into the fore rigging and then
it came to me that i was going to the
place whence paddyd fallen somehow

i	climbed out along the thumb-thick
footrope out and on out till i was out
above the waiting sea i dont know
how i loosed that royal but i did it
somehow    somehow i came down

  the ship sailed on and we began to
make her ready for her homecoming
the winds were fair and carried her
along till sixty miles north of the line
they left her one hot dawning there
was a long slow swell all day she
tumbled to it her sails all slatting
heavily against the spars and rigging
all night she tumbled to the long slow
swell and when another morning
came we clewed up all her sail to save
the canvas chafing her white wings hung
festooned along her spars but later in
the day the swell died down the sea
fell mirror-flat the day passed with
decks too hot to walk on barefooted
the pitch came bubbling up from every
deck seam and all night long the ship
lay motionless upon the mirror sea a
great round moon slow-passing oer the
sky and all night long the tropic light-
ning played round the horizon and
when day came again it was as yester-
day next night was yesternight again
and on and on and on the days and
nights passed by there came a day
when water was served out at four
oclock the carpenter told the mate
the water tank that hed been drawing
from was well-nigh empty so next day
we drew out water from the other tank
she had two tanks below and they were
full wed never drawn from it and
when he drew from it the carpenter took
a swallow of the water and then he
swore and spat my god the rats have


real experiences

got into the tank said he and so it
seemed they had you could not drink
the water and so we must go back to
the nigh-empty tank our water allow-
ance was cut down to a bare minimum
we must go thirsty till a rain should
come there was no water now for
morning coffee or for evening skilly to
save the precious water the salt pork
must be boiled in the pea soup the salt
horse in the bean soup that made the
soups too salt we cut off buttons from
our shirts and dungarees and kept them
in our mouths to keep saliva flowing
morn after morn we scrubbed the long
white decks eve upon eve when the
cruel sun was sunk beneath the mirror
sea we slopped sea water on her long
white decks to cool and keep the seams
tight all day we worked out in the cruel
sun no shadow anywhere because her
sails hung all festooned along her life-
less spars there was no dancing when
the dog-watch came no song the hard-
tack swarmed with fat white maggots
night upon night we threw sea-water
over one another seeking coolness but
there was never any cooling from that
hot tropic sea on sunday we dared
not wash nor shave nor brush our teeth
men grow quarrelsome in times like that

  twenty-one days twenty-one nights
the old girl lay becalmed no flick of
any breeze bodies were gaunt our
lips began to swell our eyes were sul-
len and our faces stubbly our hands
were thick with paint tar and varnish
the old mans eyes were like a dogs eyes
a savage dog almost too old for fighting

at dawn of the twenty-second day a
 long black cloud appeared along the
western horizon we fetched the rain
sail up and stretched it in the mizzen
rigging from side to side of her and
pushed its canvas hose down in the all
but empty tank we stripped off all our
clothes and gathered by her rail four-
teen stark naked sailors seven stark
naked apprentices dry-mouthed voice-
less lips swollen

  we watched the cloud advance a wall
of solid black we saw the rain fall in
a solid sheet flying fish leaped in
myriads at its foot dolphin skipjack
bonito albacore and barracout leaped
up to take them on the wing sea-birds
dropped on them from above wheeling
screaming then the old man spoke
two words sheet home

  we grasped the long-idle sheets and
sheeted sail after sail home no shouting

on the ropes we could not shout the
dry blocks groaned the dry sails rustled

we lay upon the deck outstretched
our mouths wide open the rain
beat down poured on our naked bodies
streamed fcom the deck out to the hissing
sea and soon we lataghed and jested
naked we slapped each others naked
buttocks flat-handed mirthfully a
light wind-puff came the sails jerked
full the ship heeled far over bubbles
racing by the mate said the liver-
pool girls have get hold of the towline

  and from that day we held a bully
breeze and she ran finely she ran be-
yond the northern tropics edge and
came to the sargasso sea and never
once a wind that was not a fine hard
wind and so because he hated to lose
any time at all by taking even one small
sail off her the old man told the mate
to leave the light fine-weather canvas
on her still under her old worn sails
we drove her on toward the stormier seas
all day we sped through the sargasso
sea with clumps of amber weed in long
long lines stretching for mile on mile
wed drop a hook and fetch a clump of
weed up and lay it on the deck and
every clump was full of tiny crabs of
wondrous coloring red crabs and green
and yellow no larger than your thumb
nail and there were little twisty shell-
fish too one sailor said by god
them weed bunches is like a sort o mer-
maid mistletoe day after day we
swept across that fairy sea

  and then one evening just ere dusk
the wind fell suddenly all in a tick and
all the air was utter still and so the
seas hitherto driven on by that warm
wind from the southwest having now
no force to push them toppled flopped
up nd down confused and aimless
that is a curious thing to watch one of
the most curious things you find upon
the sea and then a great dark bank of
cloud came sudden sweeping from the
northwest and before we could get a sail
off smote her down she went but
then her old worn sails began to split
so she came up again and in a little
while that wild wind from the north had
stripped the old girl naked not a sail
left just shreds and ribbons streaming
from her spars

  so all night long working by full
moonlight we dragged her stout storm
canvas from the lockei and hoisted it
when dawning came we had her dressed
and under lower topsails in a hard full
my life at sea



gale the combers raged the sprays
flew over her the north atlantic tried
to imitate the horn it never can do
that but gives a fairish imitation and
then when dawn was wide a sailor
shouted from the foremast we ran
we stood beside the rail and then we
saw a ship pass by-and she was bottom
up her bottom was not weedy she
was late from port lost with all
hands capsized the previous night
when caught with too much stout sail
upon her it makes a sailor feel a little
queer to see a thing like that

  when that gale died we were well up
past the azores and then a clear wind
came from the northeast and that was
not so good for we must go northeast
day after day night after night we
tacked and tacked again trying to claw
up toward the channel then a mist set in
and from the southwest came a pleasant
breeze so off we went again and in
the mist close by on that first day we
had a moments glimpse of some tall
ships towering canvas we did not see
her shape next day we heard a fog-
horn blaring from close by and then
we heard another and soon from all
about us came a constant blaring we
answered with our own that night the
mist cleared off and everywhere ahead
astern on either side were homeward-
hurrying clippers all through the day
we sailed amongst a homing fleet ship
by ship we passed our rivals by the
whole sea echoed with the ships bells
striking night came down and all the
seawas dotted with the winking sidelights
green and red and white stern lanterns
and all the night was musical with bells

  alls well sir and the lights are
bright we heard the lookouts cry

dawning came and we saw land
ahead we took the royals off her
and so we sailed in to falmouth and let
the anchor go

  chink polly tattersall and douglas
went to ask the old man for a reference
their time was out he gave them each
the same

     this is to certify that the bearejjias
  served his apprenticeship in the ship sil-
  berhorn under my command i have al-
  ways found him attentive to his duties and
  strictly honest i think he will make a
  good officer and it is with pleasure that

  i	give him this recommendation

  and then remembering the stores wed
swiped we said by god the old mans

square gay my old comrades were
but i thinking of my next voyage with
them all gone was sad thered be

green kids in place of them

  oh well just one more year id
stick it out somehow then my turn
would come i also would take my exam
for second mate and be an officer

  we sailed for hull on the north sea-
coast one fair bright morning just ere
we sailed the chanaral went out we
heard her crew all roaring out a queer
french happy homeward chantey chorus
heaving their anchor in we cheered her
as she passed and she cheered back
then off we went and saw again the white-
washed cottages set in the fair green
fields we saw the towns slip by and
lighthouses and early in the night a
wind came yelling from southwest the
old girl leaped to it the old man keep-
ing her with full sail set he said she
knows shes going home and she can
stand it

  when we came into hull after a sav-
age gale in the north sea that kept us
all on deck through four long days and
nights with scarce a wink of sleep we
heard about the pretty chanaral that
squall that drove us flying up the chan-
nel had struck her on her way across to
nantes-had struck her not astern as it
struck us but full upon her beam she
capsized and sank only her mate was
saved well thats the sailors life

  i	went to aunt clarissas first fagged
out i was and limp from that long
north sea gale ede was there and
dolly and they all saw how utter tired

i	was and how dispirited i didnt want
to talk i ate in silence while they
waited on me and then i said please
may i go to bed the light was not
yet gone in clean white linen sheets i
slept the clock round i knew naught
nor dreamed any dream a sailor ex-
hausted from the old fight with the sea 
a lad tired by lifes puzzling struggle
and life yet scarce begun when i
wakened dolly stood by my bed with a
cupof tea thank you i said

  dolly said youre unhappy dear

  my chum was drowned i answered

  she stooped and kissed my cheek there
was peace in her kiss kiss of a comrade

  one more voyage bill adams made
and then like his friend the mate will
clegg an illness overcame him on com-
ing into port and he was taken to a
hospital and there he got the explana-
tion of that vertigo aloft against which
he had so gallantly struggled


my life at sea

  the doctor bade me strip and for a
long time set tubes at my chest and back
and listened asking me many things
about the sea and the life of a sailor
then he bade me dress and while i
dressed talked aside with the chaplain
then he sat down face to face with me
anil he said you can never go back to
sea my boy hard work of any sort
would kill you any sudden shock would
be your death your hearts in a bad
way and your windpipes are choked
with asthma what you need is a long
rest and good food

  you can never go back to sea-
oh well i didnt hear the rest of what
he said i just sat staring at him with-
out really seeing him

  at last the chaplains hand was on my
arm guiding me from the office and the
doctor was calling after me ill see you
tomorrow and then the chaplain was
telling me that the doctor owned a pri-
vate hospital and that i was to go there
as his guest till i was fit to be sent home

i	didnt take any of it in all i knew
was that the ship was going to sea to-
morrow and that i was not going with
her

  a nurse gave me something to make
me sleep i woke late next morning and
looked from the window opposite my
bed out to frisco bay with the sun
bright on its green water shining in the
sun in full view was my old girl with
her great silk ensign fluttering at her
peak ahead of her was a tug-boat
and i knew that they were heaving her
anchor in and well oh very well i
knew the song that they were singing

     a-rovittg a-roving

       oh rovings been my ruin

    well go no more a-roving with you
      fair maid

  though forbidden to move i sat erect
in my bed till a hand touched my shoul-
der and the nurses voice said come
you must lie down at once i turned
to her and she put into my hand a letter
at the same time pushing me down from
my sitting posture

     this is to certify that the bearer b m
  adams has served his four-year appren-
  ticeship in the ship silberhorn under my
  command i have always found him
  strictly honest sober and attentive to his
  duties it is with pleasure that i recom-
  mend him as an excellent officer to any
  shipmaster

the

   there ends the yarn of a sailor there
 were no more ships for me   

   weary the days that i lay there and
 lone beyond all telling

   id think of dolly see her at my bed-
 side soft-eyed in the midnight her loose
 hair glossy in the candles yellow light
 reading ffom pilgrims progress to a
 child frightened in the lone dark differ-
 ent to all other girls she ever had been
 no kiss as was her kiss always in her
 presence there had been peace aware-
 ness of beauty and id think then of
 the little red book that she had given
 me ere i sailed on my last voyage-my
 last voyage read it when youre at
 sea id hear her say

when thou passest through the waters

    i	will be with thee and through the rivers
    they shall not overflow thee

   and id wish then that the ship had
crashed some black midnight upon the
stark rocks of hermite

nigh forty years are gone since i lay
there retired soon after i left him
the old man is dead long since and lost
with all hands the silberhorn lies on
the bottom far out in mid-ocean ships
are gone the steamers have our sea

   ive told a sailors yarn plain and
 simple maybe some day ill tell a lands-
 mans tale of what i found to do ashore
 plain things and simple too ive driven
 mules get up buck milked cows
 stand over bossie dug ditches scat-
 tered seed of wheat and barley shine
 pick sprout seed ive paved streets
 laid sidewalks mixing cement all day
 cleaned cesspools because i was a hobo
 with a blanket on my back ive been in
 jail crawl lice many other things
 ive been and done

  and dolly yes i went back that
spring to where the ragged robin and the
meadow-sweet droop in the dawnings
dew and stayed a little while till doctors
bade me seek a sunnier clime if i would
live then we came west together

  you hate and learn to love you
curse and learn to bless   

   four years ago i buried dolly upon a
 california hillside through thirty years
 wed played the game together then
 waking in the dark id call her name
 lone man-child in the night stunned in-
 credulous ill tell maybe some day of
 those long thirty years
