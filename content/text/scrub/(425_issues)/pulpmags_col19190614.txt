 great britain faces the future

by richard washburn child

     	illustrated	by	f 	g 	cooper

london-the man was at the charing cross station he was sharp-
 featured rather pinched in appearance not quite warmly clad he was
getting into middle age but wore upon the lapel of his coat a military service
badge which indicated that he was a demobilized soldier he probably was
going home to a suburb after a day in london seeking to make a niche for him-
self in the life of peace five years is a long time to stand the strain of war
it is marked on the peoples faces it was marked on his

   he edged his way toward the stall where magazines and newspapers were
sold and putting down tuppence he picked up a
british government publication issued by the min-
istry of reconstruction this government pamphlet
as one could see by looking over the englishmans
shoulder was entitled housing in england and
wales no doubt there will be exclamations and
protests if it is said that perhaps the act of this
man had more significance than the whole set of
deliberations of the peace conference some one
back home will want to know how it is possible to
give standing to this suggestion

  all right it can be done

  the purchase of the government pamphlet-one
of a series on reconstruction-indicated that this un-
named man who a moment later was merged in the
crowd like a pea mixed with a handful of peas had been enlisted in peace he
was a voluntary recruit in reconstruction-a movement badly named because
it suggests a repair of old conditions rather than a remaking to fit a revised
world he had been recruited by the british government he was a straw
showing the way the wind is blowing in great britain he gave the evidence
that not only the government from the top but the people from the bottom
are trying to meet on a ground of common interest-that of wiping from their
eyes the bloocf and sweat of these long years of desperation and of seeing the
new world and of trying to do something about it-together

   in this spirit of cooperation for reconstruction there is a promise of the
stability of the british in its practicality and its tendency to lop off the fal-
deral of visionaries there is an assurance that in europe when others go a
little off their sanity the british will not load their visions so heavily that their

visions spraddle out on the other hand in a national purpose to change the
old tune which was played by them before the war came-in a new determina-
tion to open their eyes to the possibility that there is indeed something real in
the existence of a new world spirit-there is a guaranty that the british will
be able to stand fast against the madness of europe and of asia without failing
to recognize and meet the world demand for social justice

but above all when the nameless man going out to hampstead buys with
money out of his own pocket a government publication there is still deeper

                           significance it is this the british are not merely
      talking about a new world they are not idealists
      as to their neighbors affairs they are working
      together reasonably well-as well as any nation
      and perhaps better-to do something at home

         it is not a bad idea for us in america to know
     what the british are doing i have been spending
     some weeks talking with statesmen and with people
     representing all the threads from which the british
     national life is woven little by little two facts be-
     come clearer and clearer as photographs are brought
     out on a plate by a strong developing fluid

the first of these whatever may be the incom-
pleteness of the british reconstruction work is that
an american will have to squirm a little if a brit-
isher says in good faith we always thought of you as commercial fellows
weve learned now that you are idealists tell me-what is being done by
your government on reconstruction for yourselves

   the second is that the work of reconstruction in great britain is the best
assurance that however other peoples may shake themselves to pieces the
british will hold together holding together they will be the bulwark against
other european peoples war-crazed and hungry and running in mobs after
leadership which knows how to tempt unfortunate humanity to destroy itself
but not how to teach miserable mankind to rebuild

   for these reasons the man who bought the pamphlet did what may prove
of more significance than the peace conference his gloveless hands spoke of
the cost of the war which has gone his worried expression about his eyes of
the perplexity of life at present while the bickerings of peace go on and on

mr child went to england as a guest of the
british government to study its program of
handling reconstruction problems - problems
as can well be imagined infinitely more com-
plex and intensified than ours britain has been
compelled to adopt plans more ambitious than
ours and to apply remedies more radical in
this the first of mr childs articles it is shown
however that america has much to learn from
great britains methods-the editor
june  

and the world cant go back to its job but the firmness
of his mouth spoke of something in the british char-
acter which holds the british together and knows
how to take on liberalism without taking on chaos

  for this characteristic in the british we in amer-
ica may have to thank our lucky stars before this
doubtful blessing called peace has ceased to belch
up world-wide disorder and before mad mobs stop
running and before all these little new nations-
set up by the principle of self-determination and
multiplying the causes for war-have taken their
hands from each others throats against the thing
roundly called bolshevism the british stand as our
buffer against aggression by insanity just as the
british navy stood for something like a century as a
buffer for us against aggression by sea

  the british without making much clatter about
it began to think of reconstruction the year after
they were in the war the british government as a
government began to do something about recon-
struction before asquith had been replaced by the
tenacious lloyd george

  it was asquith who in  appointed a committee
of the cabinet-a plant of reconstruction which shot
out at once numerous branches it was an ad-
visory body of experts drafted for volunteer serv-
ice as the irish might say it was a good deal
like our own council of national defense with two
differences the first difference was that whereas
our council of national defense was intended to
advise the nation as to how to build a machine for
war mr asquiths committee-formed when ger-
man bombs were being dropped on the women and
children of london and long casualty lists were the
reminders of conflict-was intended to advise the
british nation how to build a machine for peace the
second difference was that the council of national de-
fense was thought to be a body of authority whereas
its advice was seldom taken and mr asquiths com-
mittee on reconstruction was thought to be a purely
advisory body but its advice was often taken

reconstruction a going concern

lloyd george a year later just before we went

 into the war added a committee of his own and
six months later the british were so much impressed
with the need of investigatingtheir own future in the
new world after the war that a regular out-and-out
ministry was created under christopher addison the
first minister of reconstruction when the coalition-
unionist election came last fall the result was a
shake-up which brought
sir auckland geddes
into the ministry of re-
construction sir auck-
land is a brother of sir
eric they are known
in the music halls as
the pepper pair be-
cause they have some
of the two-fisted driv-
ing he-man qualities
of administration as
they call them in our
west and shrink from
publicity like hurley
and schwab

  none of the history
of the detailed develop-
ment of the british
ministry of reconstruc-
tion has a vital interest
or lesson for us the
british will erect the
machinery for recon-
struction which will
work under their par-
ticular form of govern-
ment we might have
done so too-no matter
who is to blame for our
failure-if we could
have created our own in
our own good way the
real point is not the
form of organization
but the fact that the
british government for
three years has worked
on reconstruction-per-
haps with the national idea of selfish interest and
perhaps with the idea also that a good kind of ideal-
ism begins with work on the home grounds

the truth of the matter is that the british with
their usual protestations of failure have managed
to produce the background of a real reconstruction

  and in this they have brought the government and
  the people into a common cause it has not been
  advertised outside of the united kingdom but the
  colonies are in on it and it is working recon-
  struction is a going concern

    not only is it working but it is working in the
  groove of enlightenment says the ministry of re-
  construction the idea of a return to prewar con-
  ditions has gradually been supplanted by the worthier
  ideal of a better world after the war the experience
  through which the country has passed has enlarged
  its sense of what is possible and at the same time
  quickened its sense of what is fair and right re-
  construction has to give shape and satisfaction to
  the strong feeling in all sections of the community
  among men and women of the most widely differing
  opinions and outlook that there is much to be
  ashamed of when we look back to the conditions of
  july  and that for justice to the living and rev-
  erence to the dead we are called to rebuild national
  life on a better and more enduring foundation

    many of the more thoughtful persons who are
  connected with british reconstruction have even gone
  deeper than this statement of purpose they are
  weighing the possibility of the governments be-
  coming too paternal in its measures war brings
  this danger

    you have had it in the united states asked h
  eustace davies who as secretary of the advisory
  council has distinguished himself as an organizer
  we too have been made
  familiar with the centrali-
  zation of authority which
  emergency demands

   we spoke then of the
obvious truth that war
menaces the structure of
democracy that even a war
fought to make the world
safe for democracy will
surely menace the demo-
cratic institutions of the
countries which engage in
it as some one has well
said citizenship checks
its brains in the lobby when

so ive
you

the tight little isle becomes the bright little isle

  it goes to war the government - particularly
  the executive as for instance the war cabinet in
  england-becomes used to unfettered authority and
  likes it to centralize everything is a simple device
  during war people know that this is the short cut
  to emergency action the individual and the local

community willingly give up their powers and their
rights of self-expression democracy is suspended
in great britain to-day they say let the govern-
ment do it just as we say in america let wash-
ington do it citizenship comes out of war strong
in spirit but blind to the wounds suffered by democ-
racy and the rights and duties of self-government
it may take years to restore the machinery which
makes the government responsible to its citizens and
the citizens active and able to express their will

                                                                              i

material and human resources

five years ago for instance one of the big
measures of british reconstruction now ready for
launching would have started an upheaval of dis-
cussion in the british empire there would have
been a controversy filling every mouth and every
newspaper demonstrations and perhaps riots would
have taken place but to-day this revolutionary
measure before parliament is spoken of in london
clubs with a yawn and the workman in leeds and
the farmer just outside of dunstable are interested
but are a little inclined to let the government do
their thinking for them the proposal is to central-
ize during a reconstruction period all control of
transportation including railways big and little
docks ferries coastal transport and even the wagon
roads themselves in one government department
probably sir eric geddes will be at its head mc-
adoo compared to this man was an administrator

    whose hands were fet-
---i	tered under the plea

   that diversified man-
agement of the rail-
ways and harbor traffic
of the united kingdom
results in enormous
waste duplication of fa-
cilities lack of stand-
ardization and extrava-
gant competition the
british propose to put
their entire transporta-
tion into one pair of
hands so that a child
cannot go to school or
a box of strawberries
move a half mile if one
finger of this british king
of motion is raised at
about the time we are
thinking of ending our
centralized railroad ad-
ministration created for
war the british are try-
ing to create for the first
years of peace the super-
traffic officer of the
worlds history

   it must not be under-
stood that the transport
bill is the exclusive prod-
uct of the ministry of
reconstruction that min-
istry is after all only an
advisory body its perma-
nence is a matter now in
doubt and it holds no mo-
nopoly of reconstruction
ideas nor must it be under-
stood that the ministry of re-
construction has taken a position
in favor of reconstruction by the
government with a fatherly
interest and a centralized au-
thority dangerously like the
efficient simple and direct
philosophy of the state which
once had its paternal nest in
berlin on the contrary as i
look into the work which has
been done i am impressed with
the fact that much effort half-
consciously given has been made
to saturate the british people
with reconstruction interest so
that reconstruction may enlist
the services of british men and
women and that thus reconstruc-
tion may come up from the bot-
tom it is significant that the british government
is able to sell pamphlets on reconstruction in the
streets of london or manchester or liverpool

   it is significant also that if one keeps an eye for
 a time on the reconstruction plans of great britain
 the grouping of these plans continued on page

 the eclipse handicap

by frank condon

illustrated by henry	raleigh

for about a week it appeared daily in the news-
papers of san francisco it read as follows
o g come home or let us know where you are all
is forgiven harmony and george queen mary

  that jovial plea came out at the top of the per-
sonal column for several days before it produced
results and then omar gill walked humbly into the
sitting room of the queen mary hotel in san fran-
cisco carrying the newspaper in his hand and look-
ing around timidly as though he expected something
to fall on him he had just finished proving to us
once again that he used his head to propagate hair
and for nothing else and he knew that we were low
in our minds over him harmony and i arose and
the reunion that followed was touching though with
here and there a faint hint of asperity

  until that moment we had not laid eyes on omar
for some four weeks and there was a clear natural
cause for the separation there was what you
might term a justifiable casus belli the said casus
beginning down in mexico and moving rapidly up
into california and it originated in omar and his
astounding mental processes

two or three months before the advertisement
appeared requesting omar to come out of his
hiding place and rejoin us in amity the three of us
had settled down in san francisco surrounded by
all the comforts of a large hotel owners of a four-
thousand-dollar mutual bank roll an automobile
and other pleasing adjuncts to a life of calm content

  it was omars personal automobile he had
bought it with his private funds owned it in fee
simple and drove it the same way it looked a good
deal like a highly magnified roller skate but omar
was mad about it and each morning he lured it out
of the garage and bounded up and down the seven
thousand hills of san francisco endangering human
life and making noises like an enraged threshing
machine

  after a month of luxurious loafing harmony ar-

rived one afternoon in a state of pleasant excite-
ment omar and i were languidly arising with that
calm deliberation found only among rich people and
omar came out in his robins egg blue pajamas and
some new patent lather and listened doubtfully to
what followed it appeared that through a lucky
combination oi circumstances harmony had stum-
bled upon a way to invest our four thousand dollars

  its a fine chance to break into the bookmaking
business he said beaming at us

  no doubt agreed omar but what do we know
about publishing the only book you ever look in
being the telephone directory

 not that kind of bookmaking harmony ex-
plained this is a gambling enterprise with others
doing the gambling there is a hard-boiled guy
named moses lewis and what he dont know about
horse racing you could get into your left eye he
wants us to go in with him agrees to do all the real
work because of his skill and is willing to take us
on as his clerks

  you mean this man wants to use our four thou-
sand i asked somewhat tremulously

  in a word yes said harmony with increasing
gusto we furnish him with four thousand dollars
which is roughly the capital required you cant be
a bookmaker without a certain amount of capital
put our money in the hands of a stranger
omar interrupted rising to his full five feet noth-
ing i knew you fell down that flight of stairs but
i didnt know you hit on your head

 he is not a stranger harmony continued
testily i know him he is a skilled bookmaker
with years of experience and he says that we can
clean up a small fortune

if hes so good why does he need us to start
him omar inquired why does the gent wish to
lean himself on our little four thousand bucks
harmony grunted disgustedly as though omar
was talking nonsense which was not the truth
does he guarantee us against loss i asked

mildly being interested in the funds to the extent of
one thousand three hundred and some odd dollars

  you cant guarantee anything in the horse-racing
game harmony continued coldly i should think
even you would know that in all real enterprises
a person takes a chance look at morgan and
rockefeller

  look at ham and eggs said omar right now
we are playing safe and i believe in sticking to it
this man lewis knows all about how to trim the
betting public argued our leader he claims that
we have a chance to make a killing and to me it
looks like a nice opening

  ive sent my money down those nice openings be-
fore omar retorted and mostly the traffic was
one way lets hang onto this modest competence
and tell lewis to pick on some one else

ater on harmony being insistent we encoun-
i tered this moses lewis who was a tall feverish
gentleman with a hooked beak and a piercing eye
we opened the negotiations and from the first word
omar gill was unalterably opposed he objected
bitterly to investing our joint funds in any enter-
prise as uncertain as bookmaking but there is noth-
ing to be gained by arguing with harmony childs
at least we never gained anything its like try-
ing to throw a soap bubble through a stone wall
harmony is and always has been and will be our
respected leader and many a time he has saved
omar and me from hunger thirst women jail and
similar disasters personally i didnt burst into four
ringing cheers over the knowledge that we were now
going into race-track bookmaking but this moses
lewis had cast his fatal spell and the night we met
him at the hotel we had dinner and came to a finan-
cial understanding

  we agreed formally to let him run wild with our
precious four thousand which was all we had in
the world if you leave out omars automobile lewis
agreed to set up in business at pergo park on the


colliers

june  

following monday employing the three of us in
minor capacities and from then on the idea was to
take large sums of american currency away from
those misguided lunatics who bet upon the com-
parative speed of horses

  omar moaned quietly throughout the preliminaries
and plucked at the tablecloth when he owns money
he likes to spend it in small sums and different
places omar can take thirty cents and get half-
way to china harmony prefers to take three dol-
lars and run them up to three million or make the
attempt therein lies the marked difference be-
tween my two simple companions in crime

  we embarked upon this business enterprise with
mr lewis the skilled bookmaker and the adven-
ture lasted exactly one week including legal holi-
days we gayly began chalking up prices in the
bull ring at pergo park on monday afternoon be-
fore the first race and on saturday afternoon fol-
lowing the last race mr lewis washed off his slate
packed up his tin reticule kicked his stool fretfully
aside and announced in a voice devoid of passion
that we had foundered at sea with all on board

  can you dig up some more coin by monday he
asked looking into three startled countenances

  no said omar hoarsely before anyone else
could speak nor by tuesday either why
then were ruined lewis replied calmly the
game has gone against us and were dead broke
the old sock is empty

  t se were conditions of which we three were
partially aware because we had observed the trend
of business during the week and had seen the jolly
old public beat us to a fine pulp and cash in from
mr lewis with disgusting regularity we dimly
realized that we were going to hear unpleasant
news but we didnt know just how bad it was now
we got the news as a careless roadside hen gets a
four-ton truck

  broke repeated our mr lewis tying on his
cravat with great care im not to blame either
because i made a perfectly balanced book all week
but the favorites won every day and that hurt us
it particularly hurts me omar said grimly
im hurt clear through and im the one that
wanted to keep away from this from the start but
no harmony knew that you were a skillful book-
maker if youre a skillful bookmaker im the king
of bulgaria omar was openly insulting and con-
tinued to be so in a tense monotone

  you mean we cant open up shop on monday
harmony asked in a shocked voice

  not unless we get more working capital lewis
said blandly were through im going east next
week unless i can find fresh backing

we went sadly home that night to the queen
mary and sat in the lee of the fireplace won-
dering why hard luck always had our name ad-
dress and office hours omar kept talking to him-
self in a low tone now and then bursting into im-
passioned oratory concerning the throwing away of
ones financial increment

 on the following morning harmony and omar
held another warm debate and omar lost it it
was harmonys urgent desire that omar take his
self-propelling vehicle by the hand and sell it to
some one for ready cash and at first omar de-
clined to consider the suggestion even in the face
of a large hotel bill and nineteen dollars for laun-
dry i listened to the two of them until it palled on
me and then sauntered into the open air at noon
omar took his automobile for a last weepy ride
he sold it as ordered and mien he returned to the
hotel he had seven hundred dollars which as he
stated with wrathful emphasis was just half what
it was worth

  and maybe you two sharks think im going to
split this seven hundred with you he said threat-
eningly ill loan you a few dollars for food but
beyond that nothing doing i am going to hang
onto this with both hands because the future looks
very sterile indeed

  i always split with you harmony said re-
proachfully

  i know omar admitted but this is one of
those times when three into seven hundred dont go
meantime our former gambling partner had dis-
covered that nobody else would back him and he
prepared to depart for the east he blew into the
hotel on monday and stated that he was all through
trying to make an honest living in california

  im going back to new york he grunted i
did my best but the luck was against us you
probably think im a false alarm but im not and
to show that i feel sorry for losing your money
im going to turn over my assets to you

  what are they omar asked coldly

  i have a trunkful of books continued mr lewis
and some evening clothes and a few shares of

mining stock worth about a dime and some other
household truck all having no great value but all
yours i go east stripped bare i shall also trans-
fer gallops to you showing that my heart is in the
right place and my intentions good

  harmony glanced up

  gallops he ruminated giving us gallops is
far from good intentions hes about as much of
an asset as a used smallpox sign

  such as he is you have him lewis went on
cheerfully im doing my best to make up for the
loss i caused i told you id give you everything
i own and i so do

  then he made out some papers and turned them
over to harmony after which he said a few parting
remarks and finally left us just as though nothing
much had happened when he departed omar
burst into song again until quieted by harmony

this gallops which he referred to was a race
horse according to a certain loose manner of
speaking nobody ever denied that he was a horse
because he had four legs and a long tail and looked
a good deal like the familiar equine of commerce
but on the other hand nobody around san fran-
cisco was ever fooled into thinking he was a race
horse in california sporting circles gallops was
notorious and his track history was a hissing and
a byword

  lewis had bought the poor old ruin from a needy
friend and had always cherished the insane notion
that gallops was a regular race horse and could run
in competition with other animals he entered the
horse in half a dozen races within a year and i be-
lieve that on one occasion gallops finished next to
last that was the race in which slippery elm fell
down on his wishbone about halfway through and
tangled himself up with the fence when slippery
finally regained an upright position and resumed
the race was ending that was the only time that
gallops finished next to last the other times gal-
lops finished last a good fair-and-square last with
about a city block between him and the contender
ahead so as not to confuse the judges

  in appearance gallops was a small black-coated
and unambitious beast with a despondent look
about him that made you believe he must have suf-
fered some terrible tragedy in youth he had pale
blue eyes and they protruded into space giving him
a startled and	continued on page

the crime of partition

by joseph conrad

illustrated by w  t  benda

in the second half of the eighteenth century there
were two centers of liberal ideas on the continent
of europe one was france and the other was
poland on an impartial survey one may say with-
out exaggeration that then france was relatively
every bit as weak as poland even perhaps more so
but frances geographical position made her much
less vulnerable she had no powerful neighbors on
her frontier a decayed spain in the south and a
conglomeration of small german principalities on
the east were her happy lot the only states which
dreaded the contamination of the new principles and
had enough power to combat it were prussia aus-
tria and russia and they had another center of
dangerous ideas to deal with in defenseless poland
unprotected by nature and offering an immediate
satisfaction to their cupidity they made their choice
and the untold sufferings of a nation which would
not die was the price exacted by fate for the tri-
umph of revolutionary ideals

  thus even a crime may become a moral agent by
the lapse of time and the course of history prog-
ress leaves its dead by the way for progress is only
a great adventure as its leaders and chiefs know
very well in their hearts it is a march into an un-
discovered country and in such an enterprise the
victims dont count as an emotional outlet for the
oratory of freedom it was convenient enough to re-
member the crime now and then the crime being
the murder of a state and the carving of its body
into three pieces there was really nothing to do
but to drop a few tears and a few flowers of rhetoric
over the grave but the spirit of the nation refused
to rest therein it haunted the territories of the
old republic in the manner of a ghost haunting its
ancestral mansion where strangers are making them-
selves at home a calumniated ridiculed and pooh-
poohed ghost and yet never ceasing to inspire a sort
of awe a strange uneasiness in the hearts of the
unlawful possessors

the polish ghost

poland deprived of its independence of its his-
torical continuity and with its religion and lan-
guage persecuted and repressed became a mere geo-
graphical expression and even that itself seemed
strangely vague had lost its definite character was
rendered doubtful by the theories and the claims of
the spoliators who by a strange effect of uneasy
conscience while strenuously denying the moral guilt
of the transaction were always trying to throw a
veil of high rectitude over the crime what was most
annoying to their righteousness was the fact that
the nation stabbed to the heart refused to grow in-
sensible and cold

  that persistent and almost uncanny vitality was
sometimes very inconvenient to the rest of europe
also it would intrude its irresistible claim into
every problem of european politics into the theory
of european equilibrium into the question of the
near east the italian question the question of
schleswig-holstein and into the doctrine of nation-
alities that ghost not content with making its

ancestral halls uncomfortable for the thieves haunted
also the cabinets of europe waved indecently its
bloodstained robes in the solemn atmosphere of coun-
cil rooms where congresses and conferences sit with
closed windows and would not be exorcised by the
brutal jeers of bismarck and the fine railleries of
gorchakov as a polish friend observed to me some
years ago till the year  the polish problem had
been to a certain extent a convenient rallying point
for all manifestations of liberalism since that time

   there are many who believe joseph conrad to
   be the greatest living writer in english the
   paradoxical part of this is that english is not
   his native tongue his real name is joseph
   conrad korzeniowski and he is of polish
   parentage it was not until he was twenty-
   one that he arrived in england in this arti-
   cle he pictures the irrepressible vitality of
   the polish nation which has survived assassina-
   tion partition and suppression-the editor

we have come to be regarded simply as a nuisance
its very disagreeable i agreed that it was and he
continued what are we to do we did not create
the situation by any outside action of ours through
all the centuries of its existence poland has never
been a menace to anybody not even to the turks
to whom it has been merely an obstacle

  nothing could be more true the spirit of ag-
gressiveness was absolutely foreign to the polish
temperament to which the preservation of its insti-
tutions and its liberties was much more precious
than any ideas of conquest polish wars were de-
fensive and they were mostly fought within polands
own borders and that those territories were often
invaded was but a misfortune arising from polands
geographical position territorial expansion was
never the master thought of polish statesmen

  the consolidation of the territories of the sere-
nissime republic which made of it a power of the
first rank for a time was not accomplished by force
it was not the consequence of successful aggression
but of a long and successful defense against the raid-
ing neighbors from the east

  the lands of lithuanian and ruthenian speech
were never conquered by poland these peoples were
not compelled by a series of exhausting wars to seek
safety in annexation it was not the will of a prince
or a political intrigue that brought about the union
neither was it fear the slowly matured view of
the economical and social necessities and before all
the ripening moral sense of the masses were the
motives that induced the forty-three representatives
of lithuanian and ruthenian provinces led by their
paramount prince to enter in a political combination
unique in the history of the world a spontaneous
and complete union of sovereign states choosing de-
liberately the way of peace never was strict truth
better expressed in a political instrument than in the

preamble of the first union treaty  it begins
with the words this union being the outcome not
of hatred but of love-words that poles have not
heard addressed to them politically by any nation for
the last  years

  this union being an organic living thing capable
of growth and development was later modified and
confirmed by two other treaties which guaranteed
to all the parties in a just and eternal union all
their rights liberties and respective institutions
the polish state offers a singular instance of an
extremely liberal administrative federalism which in
its parliamentary life as well as its international
politics presented a complete unity of feeling and
purpose as an eminent french diplomatist re-
marked many years ago it is a very remarkable
fact in the history of the polish state this invaria-
ble and unanimous consent of the populations the
more so that the king being looked upon simply as
the chief of the republic there was no monarchical
bond no dynastic fidelity to control and guide the
sentiment of the nations and their union remained
as a pure affirmation of the national will

  the grand duchy of lithuania and its ruthenian
provinces retained their statutes their own adminis-
tration and their own political institutions that
those institutions in the course of time tended to
assimilation with the polish form was not the result
of any pressure but simply of the superior character
of the polish civilization

a danger oils silence

even after poland lost its independence this alli-
ance and this union remained firm in spirit and
fidelity all the national movements toward libera-
tion were initiated in the name of the whole mass
of people inhabiting the limits of the old republic
and all the provinces took part in them with com-
plete devotion it is only in the last generation that
efforts have been made to create a tendency toward
separation which would indeed serve no one but
polands common enemies and strangely enough
it is the internationalists men who professedly care
nothing for race or country who have set themselves
this task of disruption one can easily see for what
sinister purpose the ways of the internationalists
may be dark but they are not inscrutable

  from the same source no doubt there will flow
in the future a poisoned stream of hints of a recon-
stituted poland being a danger to the races once
so closely associated within the territories of the
old republic the old partners in the crime are not
likely to forgive their victim its inconvenient and
almost shocking obstinacy in keeping alive they
had tried moral assassination before and with some
small measure of success for indeed the polish ques-
tion like all living reproaches had become a nui-
sance given the wrong and the apparent im-
possibility of righting it without running risks of a
serious nature some moral alleviation may be found
in the belief that the victim had brought its misfor-
tunes on its own head by its own sins that theory
too had been advanced about poland as if other

polish independence as a polish state comes into the world morally free

nations had known nothing of
sin and folly and it made some
way in the world at different
times simply because good care
was taken by the interested
parties to stop the mouth of the
accused but it has never car-
ried much conviction to honest
minds somehow in defiance of
the cynical point of view as to
the force of lies and against all
the power of falsified evidence
truth often turns out to be
stronger than calumny

  with the course of years how-
ever another danger sprang up
a danger arising naturally from
the new political alliances
dividing europe into two armed
camps it was the danger of
silence almost without excep-
tion the press of western europe
in the twentieth century refused
to touch the polish question in
any shape or form whatever

never was the fact of polish
vitality more embarrassing to
european diplomacy than on the
eve of polands resurrection

 the polish legion rises

hen the war broke out
there was something grue-
somely comic in the proclama-
tions of emperors and archdukes
appealing to that invincible soul
of a nation whose either exist-
ence or moral worth they had
been so arrogantly denying for
more than a century perhaps
in the whole record of human
transactions there have never
been performances so brazen
and so vile as the manifestoes
of the emperor of germany and
the grand duke nicholas of
russia and i imagine no more
bitter insult has been offered to
human heart and intelligence
than the way in which those
proclamations were flung into
the face of historical truth it

was like a scene in a cynical and sinister farce the
absurdity of which became in some sort unfathom-
able by the reflection that nobody in the world could
possibly be so abjectly stupid as to be deceived for
a single moment

  at that time and for the first two months of the
war i happened to be in poland and i remember
perfectly well that when those precious documents
came out the confidence in the moral turpitude of
mankind they implied did not even raise a scornful
smile on the lips of men whose most sacred feelings
and dignity they outraged they didnt deign to
waste their contempt on them in fact the situa-
tion was too poignant and too involved for either
hot scorn or a coldly rational discussion for the
poles it was like being in a burning house in which
all the issues were locked there was nothing but
sheer anguish under the strange as if stony calm-
ness which in the utter absence of all hope falls
on minds that are not constitutionally prone to
despair

  yet in this time of dismay the irrepressible vital-
ity of the nation would not accept a neutral attitude
i was told that even if there was no issue it was
absolutely necessary for the poles to affirm their
national existence passivity which could be re-
garded as a craven acceptance of all the material
and moral horrors ready to fall upon the nation
was not to be thought of for a moment therefore
it was explained to me the poles must act whether
this was a counsel of wisdom or not it is very diffi-
cult to say but there are crises of the soul which
are beyond the reach of wisdom when there is
apparently no issue visible to the eyes of reason
sentiment may yet find a way out either toward
salvation or to utter perdition no one can tell-
and the sentiment does not even ask the question
being there as a stranger in that tense atmos-
phere which was yet not unfamiliar to me i was
not very anxious to parade my wisdom especially
after it had been pointed out in answer to my cau-
tious arguments that if life has its values worth
fighting for death too has that in it which can
make it worthy or unworthy

  out of the mental and moral trouble into which
the grouping of the powers at the beginning of
the war had thrown the counsels of poland there
emerged at last the decision that the polish legion
a peace organization in galicia directed by pilsudski
afterward given the rank of general and now ap-
parently the chief of the government in warsaw
should take the field against the russians in real-
ity it did not matter against which partner in the
crime polish resentment should be directed there
was little to choose between the methods of russian
barbarism which was both crude and rotten and
the cultivated brutality tinged with contempt of
germanys superficial grinding civilization both
were hateful and the direction of the polish effort
was naturally governed by austrias tolerant atti-
tude which had connived for years at the semisecret
organization of the polish legion

against an ally 

only a very nice discrimination in evil would
have hesitated as to the direction besides the
material possibility pointed only one way that
poland should have turned at first against the ally
of western powers to whose moral support she had
been looking for so many years is not a greater
monstrosity than that alliance with russia which
had been entered into by england and france with
rather less excuse and with a view to eventualities
which could perhaps have been avoided by a firmer
policy and by a greater resolution in the face of
what plainly appeared unavoidable

  for let the truth be spoken the action of ger-
many however cruel sanguinary and faithless had
nothing in the nature of a stab in the dark the
germanic tribes had told the whole world in all pos-
sible tones carrying conviction the gently persuasive
the coldly logical in tones hegelian nietzschean
warlike pious cynical inspired what they were
going to do to the inferior races of the earth so full
of sin and all unworthiness but with a strange simi-
larity to the prophets of old who were also great
moralists and invokers of might they seemed to be
crying in a desert whatever might have been the

secret searching of hearts the
worthless ones would not take
heed it must also be admitted
that the conduct of the menaced
governments carried with it no
suggestion of resistance it was
no doubt neither the effect of
courage nor fear but of that
prudence which causes the aver-
age man to stand very still in
the presence of a savage dog
it was not a very politic atti-
tude and the more reprehensi-
ble since it seemed to arise from
the mistrust of their own peo-
ples fortitude on simple mat-
ters of life and death a people
is always better than its leaders
because a people cant argue it-
self as a whole into a sophisti-
cated state of mind out of def-
erence for a mere doctrine or
from an exaggerated sense of
its own cleverness i am speak-
ing now of democracies whose
chiefs resemble the tyrant of
syracuse in so far that their
power is unlimited for who
can limit the will of a voting
people and who always see
the damoclean sword hanging
by a hair above their heads

 it would be all right

perhaps a different attitude
would have checked german
self-confidence and overgrown
militarism would have died from
the excess of its own strength
what would have been then the
moral state of europe it is diffi-
cult to say some other excess
would probably have taken its
place excess of theory or ex-
cess of sentiment or an excess
of the sense of security leading
to some other form of catas-
trophe but it is certain that
in that case the polish question
would not have taken a concrete
form for ages perhaps it would
never have taken form in this
world where everything is transient even the most
reproachful ghosts end by vanishing out of old man-
sions out of mens consciences progress of en-
lightenment or decay of faith in the years before
the war the polish ghost was becoming so thin that
it was impossible to get for it the slightest mention
in the papers

  a young pole coming to me from paris was ex-
tremely indignant but i indulging in that detach-
ment which is the product of greater age longer
experience and a habit of meditation refused to
share that sentiment he had gone begging for a
word on poland to many influential people and they
had one and all told him that they were going to do
no such thing they were all men of ideas and
therefore might have been called idealists but the
idea most strongly anchored in their minds was the
folly of touching a question which certainly had no
merit of actuality and would have had the appall-
ing effect of provoking the wrath of their old ene-
mies and at the same time offending the sensibilities
of their new friends it was an unanswerable argu-
ment i couldnt share my young friends surprise
and indignation my practice of reflection had also
convinced me that there is nothing on earth that
turns quicker on its pivot than political idealism
when touched by the breath of practical politics

  it would be good to remember in the year open-
ing before us that polish independence as embodied
in a polish state is not the gift of any kind of jour-
nalism neither is it the outcome even of some par-
ticularly benevolent idea or of any clearly appre-
hended sense of right i am speaking of what i
know when i say that the original and only forma-
tive idea in europe was the idea of delivering the
fate of poland into the hands of russian tzarism
and let us remember it was assumed then to be a
victorious tzarism at that it was an idea talked
of openly entertained seriously presented as a
benevolence with a curious blindness to its grotesque
and ghastly character it was the idea delivering
the victim with a kindly smile and the confident
assurance that it would be all right to a perfectly
unrepentant assassin who continued on paye

the american colony at magella was limited
the fairchild company owners of the christina
and marias mines employed magellans and indians
the american railway which already had pene-
trated beyond the mountains into the great plains
of the interior was being built by magellans under
the direction of american engineers the engineers
themselves lived on location moving from camp to
camp as the great road advanced and coming into
the city of magella only when their thirst for amuse-
ment and civilization drove them to make the journey

  magella had no american society to speak of those
nephews and nieces of uncle sam who had drifted
down the tropic seas to the sandy shores of the little
republic were a sort of human flotsam and jetsam
the tide of life had caught them somewhere in the
states their hold on the native shore had weakened
and they had floated away southward to the land
of easy promises and unpaid debts the consul knew
them all by sight sooner or later each piece of
human driftwood washed into the consulate and
tried to make believe that it had grounded on native
soil the consul always played up the hot sun
of magella had not dried the home-town essence of
uncle sams obscure representative he spoke span-
ish and italian like a true bilingual magellan but
his english was flavored with clipped syllables and
a nasal twang when he wanted it to be he tuned
his lute to his audience he could being a harvard
man out-oxford a bostonian and he could make a
carolinian cracker feel at home he had a decent
sense of responsibility toward the feverish wan-
derers from his own land most of them longed for
america few of them ever went back there they
starved gambled drank dreamed cheated and died
under the white-hot sky of a country they pretended
to hate and the consul understood

  he understood because magella had played the
same tricks with his inner being he wanted to go
home and he never had he contemplated the danc-
ing deep-blue sea and the fruit steamers cutting
white paths out through the narrow jaws of the har-
bor and northward to new orleans pensacola key
west baltimore home the consul stood on the
beach his straw hat tipped over his eyes a green
umbrella held aloft a cigarette in one corner of his
mouth and always he turned back to the consulate
with a sigh and spent the rest of the day lying in a
hammock in the courtyard fanning himself with
a defunct newspaper and whispering to his parrot

  i am a fool thrice a fool i belong in the elm-

tree country i ought to be pitching hay in an old
red barn or teaching school at the corners i ought
to be married to a blond woman who wears crisp
gingham aprons i long for the odor of fresh-baked
cookies and steamed prunes

  then he looked around the sunny courtyard with
its wilfl-orange trees blazing flowers and patches of
sunlight and yawning reached for a tall glass of
something cold thereafter the hammock swung
lazily in the late afternoon breeze the parrot shrieked
the fruit steamer sailed up the world toward home
and the consul with the newspaper over his face
slept the sleep of those who dream

there were others in magella homeless ones who
stared at the buoyant sea with envy and longing
schreiber the pharmacist who had followed a fe-
male fortune teller from butte to magella and had
lost her there twenty years ago peterson the
banker whose past was as enticing as a picture
puzzle mccarthy the big red-headed irish man-
ager of the christina mines luisa a light-o-love
from new orleans and cavanaugh

  there were not many you see mccarthy and
peterson were the aristocrats of the colony cava-
naugh was easily the dregs on the islands and
along the indian coast he would have been called a
beachcomber in magella he was referred to as a
gentleman of leisure leisure was his stock in trade
his fetish the bride of his soul ten years before
the beginning of this story he had arrived in ma-
gella aboard the steamer libertat bringing three
trunk loads of fur from philadelphia some one
had told him that the magellans were a luxury-
loving money-spending people not unlike the rus-
sians cavanaugh had figured on magella being
somewhere near the south pole

  he arrived on a blistering-hot january day he
and his three trunks full of furs went ashore in a
native boat piloted by naked indians the city was
unbearably white behind it the towering peaks of
the santa christina swam in a haze of wavering

heat fumes the narrow streets were crowded with
barefoot people in white linen all wearing enormous
straw sombreros with chocolate-cream crowns some
of these people were cinnamon-colored some were
bronzed black-haired stony-eyed there were ital-
ians spaniards-flotsam and jetsam from all the
world they kept under the shop awnings or walked
gravely in the middle of the cobbled streets holding
green umbrellas against the blistering sun the air
was heavy with the scent of tropical flowers

  if this is russia cavanaugh groaned i am the
little white brother he took out his handker-
chief and wiped tears and perspiration away from
his cheeks

  then he sought the consul in those days the
consul wai young and uninitiated so far he had not
tasted of the exotic fruit of dreams so he listened
to cavanaughs tale of woe fitted him out with a
horse a pack mule and a native guide and sent him
back into the untamed wilderness of the campagna
to sell his stock of furs to the tapadas-those
sphinx-eyed indians of frivolous taste cavanaugh
departed what happened to him no one ever found
out he came back to magella on foot pallid fever-
ish his eyes burning his clothes in ribbons he had
some gold and no furs somewhere in that wild
land of plain and forest hehad drunk of the tropic
sleeping potion and thereafter he was no good

ten years to-day cavanaugh filled the un-
enviable position of official gentleman of leisure
in the american colony he had borrowed money of
every white man in the republic some hidden scruple
held him from taking money from those cinnamon
and bronze men who wore white linen clothes silver
rings diamond scarfpins and who carried thin bam-
boo canes-half-breed politicians and trouble makers
cavanaugh had his code he never drank with an
indian and he always wore shoes he had been
known to sell his honor for imported american foot-
wear yellow polished stub-toed hideous he was
a tragic figure he was perfectly bald and his round

behind him wide-eyed silent tense a crowd of chocolate adventurers watched the play the tropics had got him again

cranium shone like an ivory egg his eyebrows and
eyelashes were a fiery red when he smiled there
was a flash of gold from many expensively filled
teeth-relics of that philadelphian glory which
obsessed him he was a bum a wretch a degraded
senseless creature squatting in the enervating sun
of a strange land always drunk always obscene
yet cavanaugh had a manner every time the
consul kicked him downstairs or lent him a dollar
he thought sadly the fellows decent-some-
where but the spark is far down-out of sight-
if its there at all

  there is a story about cavanaugh but before
we tell it there must be a word spoken about polit-
ical crazy quilts ambition gold and love

president diego was the momentary dictator
of magella he was a royalist a man of the old
school martial proud dark-skinned with a crown
of snowy hair and kain-tucky colonel whiskers
twisted into points american influence had put
him in the palace american dollars poured into
the magellan treasury via the powerful fairchild
company kept him there president diegos seat
was as insecure as a circus riders anarchy polit-
ical corruption envy stupidity all seethed around
the white stuccoed walls of his palace would-be
dictators strutted through the streets of the city
buttonholing would-be followers and bursting into
skyrocket oratorical showers on the slightest provo-
cation one party the nationalists had already
been quenched by the fairchild company and a little
army of american workmen from the mines when
the smoke of that eruption cleared peace reigned
again in magella outwardly-that is beneath
the placid surface the nationalists were still seeth-
ing seeking another crater through which their red-
hot anti-royalism might escape in a shower of bul-
lets and patriotism back in the campagna diegos
most crafty enemy a half-breed called cammarillo
went about from rancho to rancho from village to
village gathering together cutthroats and adven-
turers forming an army of sorts with which to at-
tack magella destroy the american railway take
possession of the mines and establish the greasy
impassive cammarillo himself in that white-walled
palace on the piazza independenza

  this was the exact state of affairs in magella
one sunny morning when cava-
naugh the ex-fur merchant from
philadelphia rose from his squat-
ting position in the hot sands rim-
ming the esplanade and stretching
his arms above his head wandered
off in search of a drink he had
a few copper pennies in his pocket
-just enough for a glass of
fiery cheap wine sold in the
black little shops along the
via nazionale after one
drink life loomed like	

a blank page empty
of all save failure
and despair the elu-
sive and eternal
mirage of borrowed
money more drink
dreams memories
ugliness finally

cavanaugh knew the
damnable country
would get him he
would die on the
beach loco bitten by
flies thirsty despised

  he went into the
cafe albion sat down
at one of the cane-
topped tables and
plunged his gaze into
the little glass of
ruby - colored liquid

presently some one
took the opposite chair
and called for vino
bianco cavanaugh
tipping back his head
to let the flaming
drops burn down his
throat met the bland

eyes of a dapper magellan in a silver-corded som-
brero

  you are an american i believe

  philadelphian cavanaugh answered thickly but
with a certain pride

  the other man opened an elaborate cigarette case

the beachcomber noticed that his hands were white
and long with pointed fingers i have never met
an american he said in an ingratiating voice who
did not love liberty

  cavanaugh eyed him out of one blue red-lashed
eye the other was tightly closed there was a
sudden flash of his astounding gold teeth-capital
alas which brought little income liberty i
get you there is a job for me what is it that
you want me to do and how much

  the magellans teeth flashed too a white flash
that was sinister and beautiful he paid for both
drinks and rose from the table follow me
he said   

  an hour later cavanaugh swaggered down the via
nazionale with ten thousand dollars in his pocket
they had been paid into his broad palm by the lean
fingers of the dapper magellan one by one crisp
thousand-dollar american bank notes he had ac-
cepted them while his heart pounded and his blood
coursed through his veins like galloping horses ten
thousand dollars-to do a little thing for a man he
had never seen and never would see a very little
thing

  he crossed the piazza feeling that he owned the
town he glanced at the black-haired indian girls
selling sweets in the glowing shadow of the cathe-
dral he raised his eyes to barred windows and
encountered the liquid gaze of pretty sequestered
magellan women he grinned at them doffing his
tattered straw hat but he did not linger straight
across the dusty city to the esplanade straight to
luisa the light-o-love from new orleans who was
usually to be found in the dark sala of the cafe
nazionale cavanaugh knew his magella she was
there leaning her elbows on her favorite table her
eyes on space or on some invisible tapestry of
dreams except for luisa the room was empty
two long shafts of white sunlight like dagger
thrusts hurtled through the half-closed blinds and
stabbed the floors

  hello said cavanaugh

  luisa looked up she had never forgotten new
orleans the fashion of carondelet street 

your own tongue got you into trouble here comes the president get up and listen

                    still clung to her plumed hat her elaborate lace
                    waist her pointed shoes but magella had crept
                    into her eyes hello yourself she said

                     once upon a time in a day of supreme degrada-
                   tion luisa had snubbed the ex-fur merchant to-
                   day he patronized her clapping his hands he sum-

moned ignacio the barefooted doe-eyed master of
ceremonies and ordered drinks-not the consuming
thimbleful of fiery mozo beverage but true vino
bianco luisa opening her languid eyes smiled
at him

  por dios she said being more than half span-
ish by this time you must have looted the ameri-
can mines you spend money like a fairchild
cavanaughs lips parted he slapped his pockets
and winked happiness had given him something
of his old braggadocio had straightened his shoul-
ders and put strength into his shambling body
ten thousand dollars he whispered watching her
narrowly a good days work-eh mucliachita
and for nothing a little thing easily done

  luisa did not answer she waited until the two
blinding shafts of sunlight had moved across the
floor had shortened had turned a flaming red until
cavanaugh the fur merchant had consumed enough
vino bianco to float his dreams in the pure essence
of mountain grape a dionysian sea of intoxication
then she leaned across the narrow table and put
her hand lightly over his that very little thing
-so easily done-have you done it yet amigo
cavanaugh shook his head some half-forgotten
philadelphian propriety made him shake off her
hand not yet but dont doubt me i hate this
country it has swallowed me swallowed lost
i want to go home you know what that means
dont you decent houses decent food decent
women shoes everyone wears shoes in phila-
delphia he said fildela im going back
just as soon as ive kept my promise im a man
of honor swallowed oh my god

  he covered his eyes with his hands and then
looked at her again with haggard despair ill
tell you he whispered

fphat is how luisa heard of the little transac-
-l tion which had taken place earlier in the day
between cavanaugh and the slim-fingered magellan
in the silver-corded sombrero it seems that the
sly half-breed cammarillo longed to rid the world
of president diego he had sent an agent-the
slim-handed one-to bribe that leisurely
scoundrel of a fur merchant with ten crisp
one-thousand dollar notes cavanaugh was
to scale the wall of the presidential palace
and drop into the tangled branches of one
of the old live oaks in the garden it was
	whispered that young fairchild son of the

great fairchild himself had fallen in love
 with diegos daughter cammarillo knew
that once every month the young american
loped down from the railway camp mounted
on a mule and after shaving himself care-
fully at the consulate presented himself at
the palace cammarillo knew also that
diego always received the american in the
garden and that miss diego smiled into her
suitors eyes over a table set in the euro-
pean fashion for the serving of
tea esta bneno benissimo
cavanaugh was to wait in the oak
until the pretty scene was well
under way then he was to fire
point-blank at the president throw
his revolver at young fairchilds
feet and escape thus ridding ma-
gella of two evils-a royalist
ruler and an american who
had threatened to dominate the
public fancy

you know luisa told the
consul the morning after
cavanaughs whispered con-
fession how popular
that lad is in the
city they call him si-
gnor pug im telling
you what cavanaugh
said because some
one is going to get
hurt besides diego
i dont care how
many presidents are
killed-they come and
go but pug fair-

blinks

       ive just written a letter
       on the braille machine
       to a blind lady at home

by samuel hopkins adams

qay you fellows hailed the man with the cor-
 porals stripes at the top of the broad stairs

  the uniformed group lounging at ease below in the
luxurious country-house room gave answer variously

  that you sid

 come on down

  easy on the turn theyve moved the hatrack
three feet to the left

  whats the good word

  the newcomer laid hold on the carved balustrade
and tip-tapped his way down with brisk explorative
movements of his cane on the bottom step he
paused and turned his face with its heavy brownish
eyeglasses toward his fellows im official he an-
nounced not without a touch of pride

 no

  when did you get it

  good old boy

  welcome to the band of blinks

  yep the colonel just read me my report right
eye zero left eye ditto

  that settles it came from the group good
for sid there was a general murmur of assent

  it was a bewildering conversation for a layman to
listen to the members of the group below ap-
peared to be congratulating the newcomer on having
been declared stone blind i turned to campbell my
escort himself born in a blind institution and
though equipped with two perfectly efficient eyes
profoundest of experts in the psychology of the
sightless he answered my query

  thats the way they feel about it he knows
where he stands now he can go out after his place
in life with certainty

officially blind

before i visited evergreen that wonderful com-
bination of hospital and training school in the
environs of baltimore where the surgeon generals
office of the war department and the red cross
have united in a reconstruction program for the
blind the reference to his place in life would have
seemed the makeshift of a false hope but already
i had learned enough to have a glimmer of enlight-
enment upon the almost inconceivably ambitious yet
wholly practical program which the government has
laid out for these the heaviest handicapped of all
war victims in this room which we had fortu-
nately happened into at a leisure hour i was to
learn more

  the newly officially blind man eluding the dis-
placed hatrack made his way along the wall and
presently bumped into a chair containing a miser-
able huddle of humanity in sailors uniform

  hello said he whos this

  from the chair came a mutter which might have
been a curse

  oh all right said sid equably if you feel
that way about it and he joined the gathering in
the middle of the room

  i could see rather than hear the low-spoken ques-
tion which he put whos the guy

  new man a gob hes down

  total

  yep and he cant get used to it

  leave him alone advised zim a strapping up-
standing fine-looking young sergeant a wise guy
in all that pertains to his condition and a power for
morale among his fellows he thinks the game is
up for him hell learn better after hes got used
to us

  it was my good fortune to see developing then and

  at evergreen in the environs of baltimore the
  government is training with remarkable re-
  sults the men blinded in war as mr adams
  shows us vividly in this article it is not only
  teaching them how to make their own living
  but is restoring their morale and self-con-
  fidence and the plan eventually is to ex-
  tend these methods to the training of all the
  eighty thousand blind throughout the country

there at the hands of the experienced blind men the
schooling of that melancholy wreck in fact i am
by no means sure that what followed was not in
part at least a put-up job for the purpose of arrest-
ing his interest and establishing within his depressed
soul the foundations of confidence one of the group
who had been sitting on the piano bench playing
chords stood up

  guess ill write to the folks he observed any-
body seen my typewriter the normal blind man
says see quite naturally and means it for he sees
with his trained fingers

  buck had it came the answer its near the
right-hand far corner

  dont get mine youll muss up my string foot
shift the warning came from a youth who had
lost the use of one arm in addition to his sight and
therefore operated the capital shift key on his ma-
chine by means of a cord attached to his shoe

ive just written a letter on the braille machine
remarked another to a blind lady at home that i
dont even know shell have a fit when she gets it
that reminds me said buck ive got to clean
up some correspondence to be ready for to-night

  whats on for to-night inquired some one a
dance

  no thats to-morrow lecture to-night here
campbell nudged me and nodded toward the sailor
that sad and torpid individual had lifted his head
and was slightly craning his neck

  well im for some exercise observed a husky
young fellow in the garb of the marines lets go
over to the gym and skate

  the sailors sightless eyes blinked and he set his
hand to his head with a puzzled gesture

  good business approved two others and a
swim afterward what

  wheres jerry wont he go

  cant said sergeant zim hes taking some
special instruction in store management to-day

  at this point the sailor turned his chair and
hunched it perceptibly nearer

  what about jake

  i left him bowling a game with max for the
cigarettes said the marine

a sight for sore eyes

campbell signaled me again to look at the
jacky - which i was doing anyway he had
arisen and now painfully with every muscle con-
stricted in fear of contacts-quite the reverse of the
easy confident progress which sid had exhibited-
stumbled over to the talkers

  say you guys he began hoarsely

  well go on say it gob whats on your mind
are you guys-are yo  all- he could not
quite bring himself being very new to utter the
direful word

  blind supplied the corporal dont be afraid
of it sure were blinks

  blinks he repeated doubtfully

  thats it officially blinks and the sooner you
get used to it the more fun youll have

  fun retorted the jacky bitterly where do
you get that stuff whats the good of living when
you cant ever see-

  oh cut it gob that line of guff wont get you
anything youll never beat this game by sittin on
the seat o your pants and grouchin

  the neophyte turned this lesson over in his mind
for a moment do you honest have dances and
go swimming and-and skate

 sure why not

  about the bowling-that was a lie wasnt it
having felt rather that way about it myself i
awaited the answer with interest it came from a
plump-faced young artilleryman you call the num-
ber of any pin on the alley and ill knock it cold

personally conducted

nothing could be more refreshing to the jaded world than the
inrush of our successful business men into political economy
and national politics it may be argued that the acquirement of a
huge fortune does not involve necessarily any degree of aptitude for
either pursuit-that political economy is something of a science and
politics something of an art and that to understand either one must
have had a certain amount of training and practice but the inno-
cent ardor with which eminent men of wealth tackle world prob-
lems or lightly propose to manage presidential candidacies is too
humorous to be condemned it implies a degree of self-satisfaction
that is needed to enliven a world which events have made humble
beyond reason but it is curious to hear at this particular time
that this or that group or clique of rich men is running this or
that candidacy for the presidency sublime self-esteem that makes
the quick compiler of a fortune imagine that he can successfully
stand forth as patron of a candidate for president of the united
states when all men of moderation everywhere are looking to this
country to give a living answer to the bolshevist outcry against
democracy as a government by capitalists it can be forgiven
in human nature success often breeds delusions of grandeur but
what must be said of the shrewdness of candidates and their man-
agers who accept such patronage and are content to let themselves
become part of the entourage of a patron whose method of accu-
mulating wealth is a typical cause of the prevailing unrest un-
doubtedly they are fooled by the success of mark hanna in man-
aging william mckinleys campaign and of william c whitney
in leading the democratic party into supporting grover cleve-
land but they forget that hanna and whitney were not merely
rich men with a sudden political hobby they were political
leaders of long training great statesmen in fact either of them
would have been himself an admirable candidate for the presidency
there is as much difference between them and these extemporaneous
warwicks as there is between the homely character of mckinley
and cleveland and the mild virtues of the hopefuls who accept
this curious management the successor to woodrow wilson will
not be hand-picked the necessities of practical politics will not
let either party go before the public with a candidate who has been
syndicated the demand is for a man who represents the people
as a whole not any class or clique who will set his face against
class restrictions class hatreds class privileges whose character
leaves him free from obligation to any selfish organization or indi-
vidual  who will treat employer and employee not according to their
position in industrial life but according to their rights as american
citizens and will hold to equal citizenship as the only safe road
to sound government unless we are mistaken the american public
is as much out of patience with politicians who appeal to organized
business as with those who appeal to organized labor

in darkest europe

among the many letters from the army praising mark sullivans

 article back to america the following is one of the most
interesting

   i wish everyone could read and digest that article in the months of pseudo-
work since the armistice i have had time and abundant opportunity to think
to contrast life in the states with european life to realize and really appreciate
for the first time what america means it is impossible for me to put into words
the pride and love for that country of ours which has developed in my ten months
of service over here-and especially in the last four months

   and it is not a chauvinistic patriotism the shortcomings of our national life
are not forgotten but there is not a yank who has failed to realize i firmly
believe what a wonderful world our country is in comparison with this impossi-
ble europe i say impossible not because of the scarcity of bathtubs ice cream
etc but because of the mental attitude of the europeans their penchant for war
we thought these hideous four years would certainly show them that war is the
most stupid and heartbreaking mistake it is in the power of man to make and
we enlisted to help end this and therefore all wars but now it seems that they
never will learn better and because of their lack of a broad tolerant outlook
on life such as america possesses

    but to get back to your article your criticism of wilson as an ultraidealist
is not unfounded but-my god how these people need a little idealism yet
it is plain that his idealism is over their heads they do not understand him
as a people any more than he fully understands them it may be a broad state-
ment yet id say that these continental europeans arent civilized cant think
altruistically nor for themselves but understand only authority power force
my own attitude is i think that of the doughboy get me home then these
europeans can fight among themselves as much and as long as they like nar-
row perhaps but a sincere feeling engendered by disgust about all we get
for our aid over here is the suggestion that we pay our share as if we had been
in the war from the first day with what indignation mingled with contemptu-
ous near-mirth that expression of gratitude was received among our army men

   i favor sending every last yank home and putting up a billboard on each
coast with the monroe doctrine written on it in letters so big that they can
be seen in every european and asiatic capital america is another world
tout a fait in every way except astronomically

    this letter may not prove totally uninteresting to you because it expresses the
opinions of an average member of the a e f we read so much stuff in the
magazines and papers about the feeling in the a e f with which we do not
agree that it is a joy to see laid before the folks at home in plain black and
whitea few things we would like them to think about and act on

   a little wrong but very right this letter it repeats the old
grudge against the short-changing merchant which is a small thing
but it tells us with a restrained fury that if the american soldier
has to fight again he will want to know why and that is a big thing
the description of europe is not necessarily true what is true is
that most americans think of europe in some such terms our
war was a crusade and like the crusades it did not win the holy
land the comparison holds one step further our crusaders have
remained loyal to their faith

the rescue

few men can read their own obituaries with such imperial pride
as harry hawker and lieutenant commander grieve they
went out of this world on an adventure which deserved triumph
or tragedy as its end they were denied both they got the all
but final thrill but they gave the world the breath of their gal-
lantry to live by it was one of the occasions when life fails to
play up to its opportunities any imaginative writer would have
done better the happy accident which saved these men could not
have been foreseen by an artist strict in the logic of his theme
it was provided and humanity deprived of one vast satisfaction
rejoices in another manifestation of its two great mysteries the
courage of its own spirit and the unaccountable ways of fate

authority

the great image of authority according to lear is a dogs
obeyed in office for thousands of american citizens leather
puttees and shoulder ornaments have been a symbol of power obeyed
respected when understood but always vaguely resented to the ger-
man mind this resentment spells our ruin other europeans weigh it
with our other shortcomings in discipline we refuse to be alarmed
we have in our short years of war gained something in discipline
we have escaped the worst evils of authority in whatever form
our army is perpetuated we need to keep what we have gained to be
sure but we need more to avoid what we have so far avoided

  inflated savings

with the world needing tools capital of all kinds in order to
go back to the work of life there is no good fooling ourselves
as to the statistics of our savings putting a dollar in the bank
nowadays is about what putting in sixty cents was five years ago
not only that but any money kept on deposit since  is worth
a lot less now than it was then the till has not been tapped nor
the safe blowa nor the coins filed down-it is merely that things
are scarcer and dearer money more plentiful and less valuable the
thing to do is therefore to measure savings achieved and to plan
savings intended by the existing scale of values if it takes a dollar
to buy what was sixty cents worth save the dollar

how agreeable it would be to know what books count bentinck
has on his library shelves at amerongen of course mr
hohenzollern probably spends most of his time with the daily
papers and the bible-though what consolation he can find in the
latter we fail to see we cant help wishing he might have a copy
of schopenhauers aphorismen zur lebensweisheit-aphorisms
on the conduct of life-on his table he would find so much
there that would minister to his misery for instance where
the acidulous schopen-
hauer remarks

    in my young days i was
always pleased to hear a ring

now for something pleasant

but in later life my feelings
on such occasions were rather
akin to dismay than to pleas-

liam will think just that

     possession

in the new world after
the league of nations
is established there will
no doubt be a school of
manners not limited to
reluctant bolsheviki the
chief item of instruction
should be on the art of
possession false ideas
prevail to-day a man
says my office but his
clerks say our office

men and women assume
possession with startling
rapidity an accident
in our car or in our
streetacquires a worlds
significance beside which
the eruption of stromboli
is a small and dismal
thing just as men take
pride in texas because
they live in the largest
state so office boys are
haughty if their building
has more elevators than
any other in the world

we think the socialists
ought to supply us with
an analysis of this fury
to possess as a starting
point we offer the sug-
gestion that humanity
is all wrong - it is not
the man who owns the
office the office could

much more justly speak of my man in spite of our title deeds
and rent receipts we are all men possessed by property or by
an idea or by those we love the art of living is in choosing
our possessions-and our possessors as well

sitting down

many a man recently demobilized has a certain queer feeling of
resurrection that he has become somebody as the saying is
home inspection is so unlike what he has been used to in the serv-
ice from being a plain private regarded with care suspicion and
qualified approval he has become handsome sinewy distinguished-
looking improved by travel

ica with their gift of tongues or is mr bohn forgetful-in the
best of english the years will strengthen our yearning for a
common tongue just now it is not all-important for men who
have had a common cause and have fought for it mr bohn mis-
understands a little the nature of these states they are united

be a boy scout

by william almon wolff

illustrated by john r  neill

  when you are asked for your dollar this week-
the dollar that entitles you to membership in the boy
scouts of america-consider what these scouts did
during the war as explained briefly in this article
they certainly earned your cooperation but the
plans of the organization for the future are more
important than anything pertaining to the past
there are ten million boys of scout age in america
and there are only about  enrolled boy scouts
the organization wants to reach more boys-more
and more-enroll them and make better citizens of
them that aim is worthy of your help-the editor

now the boy scouts are after you they want
you to join the way you join the red cross
each year at christmas and there is a pretty
subtle quality to the appeal they are going to make
to you from june  to jun  suppose youre a
portly gentleman whose white waistcoat is promi-
nent and whose hair isnt what it once was youre
going to be rather pleased at being asked to become
a boy scout arent you youre going to think the
joke is worth a dollar anyway or suppose youre
one of the young women whove always resented the
fact that they werent boys

  this idea of a sustaining membership costing a
dollar a year is an entirely new thing with the boy
scouts of america-although the idea itself of
course is precisely the same as that of the red
cross the red cross has always insisted during
its great membership drives that the dollar was
relatively unimportant-that what it wanted chiefly
was the cooperation of as many americans as
it could enlist the boy scouts want your
dollar and need it-but they need you much
more than they need your dollar

  the organization feels that too little is known
and understood about it and its work it
thinks the part scouts played during the
war for instance hasnt been fully set forth
-which is true and so there is to be a
national boy scout week the idea for that
came from william g mcadoo former sec-
retary of the treasury who suggested also
the idea of the sustaining membership mr

mcadoo hasnt anything to do with the or-
ganization has never been one of its officers

he became interested in it during the first
liberty loan

  he says that when he was going about
the country speaking in behalf of the four
loans that were placed while he held office
he never got off a train without being as-
sailed by a scout trying to sell him a bond

they made him feel that the organization
was decidedly wide awake and then he
had access to the figures and knew that

scouts had sold in four loans bonds to the amount
of  and war savings stamps worth -
 they obtained  separate subscrip-
tions to liberty bonds and sold  thrift
cards or w s s cards that is scouts were respon-
sible for getting more than four million individuals
to invest in government securities-figures which to
coin a phrase certainly do speak for themselves

  so far as mcadoo is concerned this national boy
scout week represents largely an offering of thanks
and a tribute to an organization that did some of the
most valuable voluntary war work that was done
during the whole war he is at the head of a com-
mittee of citizens not connected regularly with the
boy scout organization which has been working out
the detailed plans for the week

  james e west the chief scout executive the
man in active charge of the whole organization is

rather pleased at being asked to become a boy scouc

not displeased naturally with this idea of a na-
tional tribute to his boys but he is vastly more
interested in what they are going to do and what he
thinks they can and should do in the future than
in anything that lies behind hes a discontented
restless man and goes about bewailing the fact that
there are ten million boys of scout age in america
and that the boy scouts have only about  on
their muster rolls

  weve done pretty well he says in effect but
think of what we could do if we had as many mem-
bers as we should	

be prepared

of course west really is tremendously proud of
what the scouts did during the war and they did
make a remarkable record they were ready you
see-they were ready on april   there were
about  of them then organized into troops
and patrols uniformed mobilized the motto of
the boy scouts is be prepared and they live
up to it so they had no need to make extensive
preparations word was flashed from headquarters
in new york and all over the country scoutmasters
placed their troops at the disposal of the local au-
thorities for any service that might be required

     the situation was without precedent no one
  knew just what use could be made of the scouts
  but here was a uniformed organized disci-
  plined force of boys larger than either the
  regular army or the national guard at that
  time and west and his associates knew that
  there was something it could do

     they were right the first big job the
     scouts did was in the first liberty loan
     that established them gave the govern-
     ment an idea of their value and imme-
     diately afterward the navy department
     appealed for help

       it isnt generally known even now but
     there was a good deal of nervousness in
     washington about the atlantic coast it
     wasnt properly patrolled men for that
     service werent available no proper sur-
     veys had ever been made if the germans
     had planned submarine raids as there was
     good reason to suppose they might have
     done they might easily have arranged for
     beacons and signal stations the boy scouts
     working with the navy made a survey that
     plotted accurately the location of tele-
     phones buildings available for barracks and
     hospitals etc along the whole coast plans
     were worked out for patrolling the whole
     line from maine to florida in case of need
     with older scouts and a good deal of con-
     fidential work was continued on page

a very hard steel ball is pressed
into the surface of the forging at
regulated pressure and the indent-
ation thus made varies in size ac-
cording to the degree of hardness
of the metal this is the brinell
machine in connection with which
indentations have been taken for
every grade of steel in every con-
dition of heat treatment so that it
is possible to produce forgings to
any desired degree of machine-
ability science countenances no
guesses or approximations in mod-
ern forge practice

in men and in nuts round shoul-
ders mean life has been too
much for them

 to your upstanding workman
the scarred face of a round shoul-
dered nut is a mark of disgrace

 so he demands a billings 
spencer triangle b wrench because
his own reputation makes him value
theirs

  you can safely take a workmans
word for what is right in tools

  he will tell you the triangle b
wrench fits his hand as if it were glad
to work with him-its steel is tough
not brittle with a hidden some-
thing in its makeup which means
honest years of service instead of
dishonest months of trouble

  that hidden something took sev-

eral thousand men fifty years to
make it is the value behind the
triangle b trade-mark on a tool
a drop forging or a great machine
it says rely on me and it has
said that to the world of industry
since the days of the civil war

 remember the last time you
worked over a difficult nut did
your wrench slip just a little and
make the hard job harder triangle
b wrenches would have helped in-
stead of hindering-they fit those
hard-to-get-at nuts cleanly surely
without a slip

garage accessory man will approve
your judgment when you say

imbecile expression he was worth about forty dol-
lars for purposes of glue and other by-products and
nobody knew his age but it was popularly supposed
that he dated back to the period when dressy gents
stopped wearing detachable cuffs

  this was the sad-faced equine which mr lewis
now added to his alleged assets and turned over to
us in lieu of our four thousand iron gentlemen

  which is going to do us a lot of real good
omar said bitterly after we had discussed gallops
he couldnt beat an old lady going home for her
wooden leg i saw him run once in a race or at
least he was supposed to be running i could carry
a couple of kitchen stoves under my arm and beat
him myself

  well we might sell him to some vegetable dealer
or a livery stable harmony argued and any-
how who are you to be throwing away our assets

thus it was that we came to accept gallops mr
lewis departed for new york soon after and in
the course of the next few days harmony omar
and i wandered out to the scenes of our undoing at
pergo park while we were there it occurred to
harmony to have a brief look at gallops we
were directed to his boudoir at the end of a row of
ramshackle stables and found the place in charge
of a man ninety years old and partly deaf he
moodily opened a door and led us to the inner sanc-
tum where we found gallops engaged in eating away
the woodwork

  so you own gallops do you the oldish person
remarked after we had yelled at him a while well
theres a thirty-dollar bill against him for oats
somebodys got to pay it

  sure said omar i might have known

  harmony and i gazed at our new possession with-
out the slightest enthusiasm he looked pessimistic
and underfed and you could see all his larger ribs
and part way into his engine room he had a high
proud head and a curly mane omar tried to look
at his teeth and nearly lost two fingers

  this being gallops he remarked bitterly he
ought to be shot or given to some curio collector
ive been looking at horses all my life and i know
when to give them away

  we didnf expect him to be good for much when
we took him harmony reminded running his hand
up and down gallopss centerboard after a pro-
longed argument with the old man about the oats
bill we returned to the queen mary and settled down
in our new poverty drawing small sums from the
flinty-hearted omar and listening to his never-ending
reproaches

  a week later we made another pilgrimage to the
track but having no loose change we refrained from
speculation and spent the time talking to casual
friends the three of us lingered and harmony
crowded himself into a two-bit crap game under the
stand where it took him some time to lose the little
he had omar and i waited in impatience and thus
it was that we were late in leaving the park the
days sport was ended and the racegoers had long
since departed for the city harmony rejoined us
and paused to light a cigarette and we were standing
there innocently leaning against the railing in the
semiobscurity of the late afternoon when something
passed on the other side it went by like a six-inch
shell there was the rush of wind the hum of a
moving object and then silence

  what was that omar exclaimed turning a
startled eye on me

  it sounded like a horse i returned

  harmony had lighted his match and when it
burned his fingers he dropped it

  it sure sounded like a horse omar admitted
peering down the dim track

  no horse lives that can go that fast harmony
retorted they aint no such horse

  we stood there in foolish debate and finally 
climbed on the fence and sat there expectantly soon
we discerned something coming toward us out of
the gloom it was an indistinct form at first but it
gradually took shape and as it approached we saw
that it was a horse and perched on its back was a
small figure when the animal was opposite har-
mony shouted and the rider came over

  what horse is that he demanded of the dim form

  gallops said the voice

  i	heard a noise as of omar falling off the fence
and when i looked he was picking himself up

  gallops harmony repeated with forced calm

gallops you aint making any mistake are you
you sure thats gallops

   i ought to know boss said the voice im the
exercise boy on this track and i sleep in the same
stable with this hoss

  did you go by us a few minutes ago harmony
inquired incredulously

  i sure did go by you said the boy we was
agoin it wasnt we

   he chuckled gently and stroked the surprising beast
we climbed down on the track side and made a
careful investigation the lad was tell-
ing the truth the horse was our own
gallops popeyes and all we later
learned that the youth worked in the
particular group of stables infested
with our gift horse and it seems
he derived singular enjoyment
from taking our asset out and
running him around the
after office hours

   boss how he kin go
said the boy admiringly
and we felt of gallops
anew to make sure it
was he

  have you run him
far harmony de-
manded and the boy
announced that he had
merely jogged a fast
quarter mile

   very good said har-
mony im mr childs
and hes my horse run
him clean around the
track this time and
well hold a watch on
him and dont forget
to hurry him

  all right said the
jockey i didnt know
this was your hoss

  you had nothing on
me said harmony and
the lad steered gallops
out to the center of the
track and started

   there in the gathering
dusk we timed our aston-
ishing race horse he got
off like a mauser bullet
we heard the departing
thud of hoofs and a little

later the noise began coming from the opposite direc-
tion harmony and omar both held their watches
on the tryout and i now forget what the time of
that test was anyhow if i did remember and put
it in people would call me an infernal liar let it
go with the truthful statement that it was faster
than any horse ever traveled a mile in california
up to this time it was one of these miracle miles
the boy turned around and cantered back to us
omar closed his watch

  whats the matter with him he asked he
never went that fast before in his life what have
you been doing to him

   not a thing grinned the boy the fact is this
here gallops is a peculiar hoss and im the only
one knows it see them funny eyes them aint
regillar hoss eyes no sir this is a popeyed hoss
and he cant run in the daytime on account of them
eyes he hates daylight and wont have nothin to
do with it but give him a little darkness like
were havin now and hes the dog-gone fastes race
hoss in the world hes what i calls a night runner
and they aint nothin on four legs that can beat him
thats funny said harmony in a calmer man-
ner take him back to the stable and heres a
dollar for your trouble

omar painfully dug up the money and the boy
disappeared then the three of us walked thought-
fully away to catch the car for san francisco

a night runner said omar reflectively theres
something i never did hear tell of we now own a
horse which can only go in the evening wont it be
sweet for us if they ever have horse races at night
yes i agreed but they never did have night
races so i suppose we neednt bank much on that
anyhow said harmony as we caught the car
it was worth something to know this about gallops

  yeah-worth a dollar answered omar thinking
of that same

  five days later at three oclock on the afternoon
of a very rainy miserable day the door burst open
and harmony childs dashed in one look at his flushed
countenance assured me that he was coming down

                  with an idea because an attack of
                  thought in harmony is always ac-
                  companied by exterior changes he
                  waved a newspaper aloft flung his
                  hat into a corner and dropped into
                  a chair

  it was bound to come he said
theres no such thing as the luck
going one way all the time
whats up i asked

  ive got a grand hunch he con-
tinued this horse of ours which
has so far never won a race is
about to win one

  you go and see a doctor omar
snorted you got a fever

     listen said harmony you
  remember the other day when i
  said if we could ever get gallops
  into a race under the proper
  lighting conditions we would
  thereby win a race with him
  very good the right condition
  is about to arrive i am going
  to enter our mutual horse in the
  third race at tia juana on the
  afternoon of thursday the th
  of august time about three
  oclock

    which is down in mexico
  omar returned in disgust we
  are up here in san francisco
  and so is our horse why are
  you going down there and how
  are you going to get there

    in tia juana harmony
continued impressively-in tia
juana on thursday the th of
august at three oclock there is
to be an eclipse of the sun it
will likewise be elsewhere on the
north american continent but
the path of greatest totality so
the paper says runs across
northern mexico and through
tia juana because of this sci-
entific fact a crowd of astrono-
mers are going down there and
so are we does all this mean anything to you two
mental giants

  not a thing omar admitted unless you get a
job carrying bags for some astronomers

  well it means something to me harmony went
on with a triumphant note in his voice this
eclipse will bring about a condition of partial dark-
ness which is meat for gallops hes going to find
just enough murk for those popeyes of his and thus
we enter him in the three oclock race and win it
thats plain isnt it

  yes said omar but if we send him down to
mexico it means plenty of expenses and how do
we pay all those expenses

  with what remains of the seven hundred you
got for your automobile harmony answered cheer-
fully youll have just enough left to pay the
preliminary bills and enough for the hasty betting
which i intend to do

  youre going to bet on gallops omar asked
doubtfully

  everything you have left harmony answered
the horse will be about a hundred to one as he
always is we will take what is left of your fund
which ought to be about five hundred by that time
and lay it all at those sweet odds we therefore
clean up something like fifty thousand dollars

  i regret to see that you are no longer partially
insane omar remarked coldly you are now all
insane

  we win just about fifty thousand dollars har-
mony said rolling the figures under his tongue like
a sweet morsel this is not a gamble at all this
is what we term a mathematical certainty we own
a night runner that can beat any horse in the world
and at tia juana he will probably be running against
a bunch of hounds it is all over but banking the
money	continued on page

table contrived to touch each others hands while
they groped for the sugar tongs and assorted cups

father owned the santa christina mines behind ma-

  he ran up the steps of the consulate saw that
the consul was still asleep in the patio possessed
himself of the tin bathtub in the kitchen and was
presently heard to splash and sing while the con-
suls indian boy beside himself with mirth fried a
dozen eggs for lunch

  oh you americano the consul said waking to
this serenade of soap song and frying pans come
here i have news for thee

  presently pug appeared in the sunny courtyard
shining clad in a suit of immaculate duck he tipped
the drowsy consul out of the hammock you have
eaten of the lotus he said gravely

  the consul sat up and rubbed his eyes you are
the antidote he laughed

  at lunch he told his guest of luisa her tearful
story and the brave intentions of one cavanaugh in
whose breast a hate was burning

  some day he said you may grow to understand
this country the ways of it are passing strange

ready acquired a nickname which is only another

great britain faces the future

under the ministry of reconstruction and in the cabi-
net notebook gradually fades away and there is left
for all the world to see the fact that the british
program can all be written down under two columns

  these two are material resources and human
resources one concerns itself with things the
other with men one plans for conservation
finance law trade transport and scientific re-
search  the other for better babies better houses
better health better jobs better heads and in
the labor which has been given by the british to
this second group there is promise of a better na-
tion an assurance of progress without explosions

   the spirit of the world to-day causes our peo-
ple to take much more interest in the second
group as you have defined it i was told by the
head of one of the divisions of the ministry even
our manufacturers and bankers and officials are
more interested in our human reconstruction than
in any other phase but this does not mean that
our economic reconstruction has been neglected

  no it has not a nation which has dropped
some hundred and twenty-odd billions into the
mouth of war which turned its industries inside
out to make things to throw at another people
has a good deal to do in order to harbor and de-
velop new resources a country which buried a
large part of its coming generation of young men
who were to take on its economic leadership to-
morrow has much to do to fill in the gaps of men
by wise prevision as to material resources a
government which is not at all sure that war is
over-and which feels as the people of europe
are feeling every day more and more that new
dangers are hanging over them in spite of the
complacent assurance in america that permanent
peace has come-has to conserve and stop all
waste only the other day lord lansdowne was
saying that instead of a possibility it was almost
a probability that before the peace conference had
opportunity to use its return-trip tickets the fire
would break out again that great britain might
be forced to gather up her strength once more for
policing or fighting the end is not yet and it
still costs the government about  a
day to foot its bills so the british have begun
a conservation campaign they have three main
purposes saving their coal supply reforesting
the country and reorganizing agriculture so that
the islands may be as nearly as possible able to
feed themselves in case of need

    the need of coal and timber

have the investigations brought out interest-
ing facts they have brought out startling
facts for instance in the united kingdom they
consume  tons of coal for motive power
alone but this consumption of coal in transport
and industry is under an industrial system which
still leans upon man power the use of motive
power per laborer is found to be much less than
in germany and about one-half that applied per
laborer in the united states a coal-conservation
committee has put under the nose of british in-
dustry once again the always forgotten fact that
the united kingdom is not yet a modern machine-
producing country as a manufacturer said to
me in america when you want to cut up a
beef a machine carries the carcass to first one
butcher and then another most of them using ma-
chinery the completed work is the work of how
many men well here a beef is cut up by one
man-a man who needs to be a very skilled man

if he walks out that particular beef cannot be cut
up but your men are unskilled you can pick
them up anywhere with the increased use of
machinery will come the increased use of coal

  therefore the british are boring to find new
coal fields they are conducting experiments in
economies in mining and they are planning a
national distribution by electrical power of the
energy derived from their coal it is proposed to
erect superplants for the generation of electric
energy to distribute this energy for manufactur-
ing purposes in sixteen districts to locate the
generating stations near the coal mines so that
coal now wasted may be used and so that the trans-
portation charges on moving coal may be saved to
unify the six hundred independent authorities now
making and distributing electric energy so that a
national system of economy can be established

  suddenly too the british have awakened to the

continued from page 

need of a timber supply they have uncovered the
fact that the yield in the united kingdom is about
one-thibd of what it should be if the proper care
were to be given the growth upon the present forest

olive drab or sailor blue
walks in and asks to see the boss-

       and the boss of course is you
if a fellow clad in khaki

       olive drab or sailor blue
walks in and asks you for a job-

      what are you going to do

         -put him on

hes the felloiv please remember

      when the huns knocked at our door
to whom you prayed with fervor

      keep the germans from our shore
hefs the fellow-oh remember-

      who knee-deep in mud and gore
gave your prayer a happy answer

       made your hearthstone safe once more

         -put him on

when he marched away you cheered him

      have you cheered him coming back
have you given him a welcome

      since he laid down gun and pack
have you thrown his deeds in discard-
put his record on the rack

is it you wholl be a slacker

      to the boy who didnt slack

         -put him on

if a fellow clad in khaki

       olive drab or sailor blue
walks in and asks you for a job-

      what are you going to do

yes of course it seems a problem

       may mean sacrifice for you

but-remember chdteau-thierry-

       hes been sacrificing too

         -put him on

land but proper care of the present acreage is
not enough the british have just opened their
eyes to the fact that wood is still an element in
civilization the lesson of denuded china and korea
has caused a shudder the consumption of wood in
the united kingdom is more than ten times the wood

 now produced two million acres are available for
 timber planting it is proposed that bounties shall
 be offered for timber growing so that the experi-
 ence of a shortage of wood for war purposes now
 the truth is out-a pinch that the british felt
 during the war shall not come in any future
 emergency how much would it cost the in-
 vestigating committee estimates a cost of less than
 two days expenses of the war

reorganizing agriculture

   just as the primary consideration of national
   safety dominated the thought of those who re-
   ported on forestry so also did it dominate the
   thought of the committee dealing with agriculture
   the british now are willing to admit officially that
   at times the war appeared to turn on the win-
   ning of a race between the plow and the sub-
   marine say the lords commissioners of the
   admiralty in a letter now permitted to be pub-
   lished the certain development of the sub-
   marine may render such vessels still more for-
   midable as weapons against sea-borne commerce
   any measures which rendered the united king-
   dom less dependent upon the importation of food-
   stuffs would add immensely to national security
   forty-six million acres are under cultivation in
   the united kingdom but these do not furnish
   more than a fraction of the food supply of the
   forty-six million souls in fact the rate of pro-
   duction of food supply just before the war would
   only furnish enough food in every week to last
   from monday morning to wednesday evening
   it is said that the supply of wheat always used
   to be only about six weeks ahead of the empty
   national bin

     the war and the reconstruction committees
   have awakened the british to the fact that of the
   cultivated lands in the united kingdom about
   three-fourths were growing grasses when the war
   came in germany about three-fourths of all cul-
   tivated land was growing cereals vegetables and
   fruits the reason for this lies in the fact that
   a large proportion of british farmers find less
   risk less labor cost and a firmer policy in oper-
   ating tillage land and turning grasses into meat
   if the british are determined to change a condi-
   tion under which the average cultivated  acres
   fed thirty-eight mouths while in germany the
   average  acres fed about seventy-five mouths
   it is becoming plainer to government and tax-
   payer and food consumer and those interested in
   guaranteeing national safety in war that the
   farmer who turns grass land into arable land
   must have the risks of loss-risks coming from
   fluctuating and loiv prices combined with higher
   wages for labor-offset by some form of perma-
   nent price guaranty by the government the
   corn production act did this as a war measure
   the agricultural committees of british recon-
   struction are urging that the procedure be made
   a permanent policy

for science and research

  going on from reconstruction policy as ap-
  plied to the natural resources of coal wood
  and soil the british for more than two years have
  been working out the foundation for better indus-
  trial production better carrying facilities and
  communication facilities better arrangements of
  finance and better methods of oversea trade

     i spent some time trying to find all the com-
   mittees working on these subjects and i do not
   believe that anyone to-day-even lloyd george-
   has at hand a complete list there are special
   committees for specific trades such as the chemi-
   cal industry shipbuilding and textiles commit-
   tees on the supply and allocation of raw materials
   committees on financial facilities and on enemy
   debts legal committees working out new laws
   such as that which permits the taking of private
   lands for public and reconstruction purposes and
   those to regulate combinations and trusts there
   are committees on colonial affairs and there is a
   whole new structure of scientific and industrial
   research the ministry of reconstruction has
   many of these in its basket but others developin
   other departments of the government such as the
   war office and the board of trade

  these committees are made up of several hun-
dred experts of capitalists of laboring men of
persons who have become continued on jage

a flood-light

widespread far-reaching all-revealing ones entire field of vision
is illumined by diffused light just as it is by day

legal everywhere

yet a light thats unrestricted that is not held down not dimmed
a ten-fold better light than the glare-light which a thousand laws forbid

they will loan you

a pair of warner-lenz for a week

 present the coupon below to any
warner-lenz dealer he will put a
pair of warner-lenz in your car for
a one-week test pay no money-just
try them for a week then return
them or buy them as you choose

  just find out on your own car that this
lawful light is vastly better than forbidden
light far and wide high and low it floods
your whole field of vision yet there is no
blinding glare your dealer will accept your
verdict when you prove that out

the situation is this

  the laws of  states and of countless com-
munities now forbid the glare-light the
golden rule-a world-wide law-forbids them
everywhere anything so dangerous and of-
fensive has to go

  dimmers are a makeshift and a nuisance
they quell the light too much for country
roads

  the shaft-light in addition over-lights a
narrow strip of road it fails to light the
nearby roadsides or your curves and turns
it pierces straight ahead searchlights are
illogical on land

now on a million cars

  some sixty methods have been offered
for creating legal light but the warner-

lenz from the start to now has dominated
in this no-glare field over a million motor-
ists have adopted it a long list of leading
makers now equip every car with the warner
it practically stands alone but there are
millions of others who need this ideal lawful
lens and we want them to learn what it
means to them

reasons for supremacy

  the warner-lenz gives better light than
any clear-glass lens it scientifically combines
 lenses in one and diffuses the light over
a fan-shaped area

  it supplants a glare-light with a flood-light
-a diffused light such as daylight is

  it lights the road and roadsides the curbs
and ditches the curves and turns

  it makes ones full light legal under every
law without the use of dimmers

  lombard tractor     vim         
  as there are no direct beams no glare rays
this light is not restricted to  inches high
so it lights the road signs high and low the
upgrades and the downgrades

  warner-lenz light is not affected by rise
and fall of the car nor by turning of the lens
in the lamp-rim that is vitally important

enjoy them for a week

  now we ask you to try out this ideal lawful
light compare it with yoiir glare-lights or
with other legal lenses there will be no cost
no obligation if the warner-lenz does not
delight you take them back

  do this now it is time to quit glare-lights

the ideal light which a million have adopted
it is time to end the tenseness of night driving
it is time to have your car equipped like the
cars we mention here

warner-lenz dealer these lenses are now
handled by thousands of dealers in motor car
accessories and in hardware stores if your
dealer cant supply you send to us

  then you can see youre joshing me whined
the gob

  for reply the bowler who later on beat me a
game rolling purely by sense of position and direc-
tion-though to be sure i am a poor hand at it
took the jackys fingers and ran them beneath his
own eyebrows where a shell fragment had passed
like a dredge if you can find an eye in my head
ill give it to you he offered generously

  zim now judged that the psychological moment
had arrived you come along with me and see the
world he invited and the new man with a new
light on his face went out arm in arm with the big
fellow when i met them afterward together even
my untrained eye was able to discern the contrast
between the two types what the experts at ever-
green call the blind blind and the sighted blind
the jacky slow uncertain shuffling expressing in
his slumped shoulders overhung chin and unrespon-
siveness the malaise of the spirit within zim up-
right brisk turning to look you square in the eye
such is the effect it gives when speaking or spoken
to alert interested a man among men who in half
an hours association makes you actually forget his
disability

  as he and his companion went out they passed
coming in with quick expert cane-tappings an engi-
neer with the top half of his face plowed and seamed
into twisted furrows what remained of the group
greeted him with the news about sid

  sids a blink official

  im in luck too the newcomer announced jubi-
lantly theyre going to give me the knife to-
morrow

  sculp lady made you a new face this appar-
ently irreverent reference was to miss cook the
sculptress who makes an individual study of each
face to be restored constructs a model and turns
it over to the surgeons of a hospital separate from
evergreen to build from in flesh and tissue the
results are remarkably
faithful to the original
form of the face

  surest thing you know

good as new or better

  youll be a picture

mike

  a sight for sore eyes

  oh you lucky stiff
sighed the artilleryman en-
viously fingering the ter-
rible scars where his eyes
once were

  never mind old sport
the other comforted him
youll get your turn pretty
quick now

  mike said one of the
youngsters seriously they
tell me you got a jew beak

get em to take the hook off
your nose while theyre
at it

jew yourself retorted
mike and truthfully what
about your own smeller

  whos got a better right

often heard made by smokers that the pleasure of
smoking is closely connected with seeing and
that a blindfolded man cannot tell whether his
tobacco is alight or not i mentioned this theory
to campbell and expressed curiosity as to the blind
smokers view of it

  ask him said campbell

  wont he mind

  why should he

ill have to suggest or at least imply his blind-

                                        vsv- itt

ness

           

  dont suggest it speak it out

  so i did mike laughed ive heard that bunk
before he said nothing to it i get more taste
out of tobacco than i ever did before

it

the darn thing was loaded

thus another superstition succumbs to expert tes-
timony incidentally i had stumbled upon a point
in the psychology of the newly blinded they do
not shrink from direct reference to their condition
what they feel and even resent is the clumsy and
painful avoidance of the word blind which com-
pels them to self-consciousness one of the prized
legends of evergreen is cals response to a well-
meaning but tactless woman visitor who wishing to
express interest in his misfortune but fearing the
matter-of-fact and obvious word stumbled verbally
about for a while and finally put it this way

  did the germans-er-injure your-er-vision
oh io maam said cal with empressement i
just happened to lean up against a barrage and the
darn thing was loaded

  strange to say while the sightless do not once
they have adjusted themselves brood over their
blindness they are extremely though often secretly

sensitive to its physical aspect which they tend to
magnify they are prone to imagine that their
wounds have made them monstrous horrifying to
the eye one of the most piteous sights i have seen
in any hospital is that of a blinded man when he
thinks he is unobserved nervously fingering his
scars building up for himself heaven knows what
false picture of grotesque and hideous defacement
it is for this reason that they so eagerly go under
the surgeons knife even though the disfigurement
is slight happily the operation always satisfies
them after it is over and they have been supplied
with tinted glasses concerning the exact hue of
which they are most particular that it may accord
with hair and complexion-a touching and harmless
bit of vanity-they are quite content they would
be equally so if they could see themselves as re-
constructed in a mirror for under the skillful model-
ing of the sculptress and the surgery of the experts
even the worst of the cases and very few are badly
marred come out looking normal and unremarkable

                          news and feel as i do

lots of things to be
thankful for two arms
two legs and a  of

dont let any of the home folks worry
about me uncle sam is going to train me

  cal represents one type of the blinded soldier
he is what the french call un exalte naturally
of an idealistic temperament he has given to his
country everything but life-more than life itself
it must have seemed to him at first-and the passion
of the devotee is upon him and is carrying him un-
faltering and triumphant to his future of useful-
ness in the world courage patience determination
cheerfulness all have been fused and made dynamic
in the fire of that devotion with it all there is no
taint of pose or priggishness cal has too much
humanness and humor for that witness the occa-
sion on which he leaned up against a barrage for
the edification of the maladroit sympathizer since
his arrival at evergreen he has married a keen-
witted and charming girl do you think id pick

   when the need of speed in aircraft
 production was realized one of the diffi-
 culties was to find walnut of the sort
 that is essential in making airplane
 propellers

  the boy scouts made a survey
they located  feet of stand-
ing walnut-the equivalent of 
carloads and more than enough for all
needs moreover they pledged every
man who cut down a walnut tree to
plant five seedlings in its place or
arranged to do that work themselves

learn by doing

 later when commercial methods of
 i gathering the fruit pits required in
 the making of gas masks broke down
 scouts gathered more than a hundred
 carloads of stones
 -enough for half
 a million masks

   they were used
 all over the coun-
 try to gather
 books for camp
 libraries here and
 abroad you may
 remember if you
 sent a post card
 to your library
 to offer some of
 your spare books
 seeing a scout at
 your door the
 next day to col-
 lect them they
 planted and cared
 for more than
  war gar-
 dens

   the committee
 on public infor-
 mation heard
 what the scouts
 were doing and
 drafted them
 forthwith scouts
 were responsible
 for distributing
 more than thirty
 million pieces
 of government
 literature and
 propaganda
 -documents that
 explained why we
 were at war that
 maintained mo-
 rale that offset
 the skillful and
 threatening prop-
 aganda of ger-
 m a n y and of
 pacifists and
 agitators who
 werent even ger-
 man

  the food and
fuel administra-
tions both made
extensive use of

 boy scouts in spreading their conserva-
 tion appeals

   scouts served as orderlies as bicycle
 and motorcycle messengers and dis-
 patch bearers they worked in the
 making of surgical dressings under the
 red cross

when a survey of any particular lo-
cality was required with information
as to available telephones lodgings and
so forth scouts were nearly always
called upon to make it

  boy scouts did another unspectacular
but infinitely valuable bit of war serv-
ice  they turned themselves into office
boys to meet the shortage that devel-
oped during the war in that sort of
help

  in the great shipyard at hog island
for example the most serious difficul-
ties were encountered in finding boys
to come out from philadelphia to
run errands and maintain relations
between widely scattered offices boy
scouts volunteered and provided a com-
plete staff they did their work in uni-
form without pay and they had much
to do with- creating the morale that
existed at hog island



they located  feet of
standing walnut- carloads
-more than enough for all needs

   in washington the scouts made it
 possible for some of the most important
 of the new departments created for war
 service to keep going

   there are the concrete reasons for
 gratitude to the boy scouts as an or-
 ganization mr mcadoos original im-
 pulse to arrange a sort of testimonial
 in recognition of public service well and
 faithfully rendered finds justification
 in the record but his idea has grown
 beyond the recognition of its sponsor
 almost

   the best results of what the scouts
 did during the war arent evident yet
 says james e west those boys are
 going to be better citizens because of
 what they did citizenship is going to
 have a real and vital meaning to them

   in a time of grave emergency they
 learned how to function as valuable
 working members of their government
 in them all the patriotic fervor all the
 impulse to service that the war gave
 us all was directed and disciplined
 their mifrds were turned into the

                  right channel
                  thanks to the or-
                  ganization they
                  had the oppor-
                  tunity to do what
                  all american boys
                  wanted to do-to
                  take an active
                  part in the war

                  and now we
                want to reach
                more and more
                boys the boy
                scouts aim to
                supplement
                church and home
                and school in
                building charac-
                ter there isnt
                enough character
                building in amer-
                ican education
                we are shame-
                fully backward in
                 education itself
                too a very small
                proportion of
                boys gets to high
                school - a much
                smaller one
                reaches college
                the others go to
                work because they
                must ern money
                they dont select
                their work they
                drift into it and
                so a great class
                of aimless unam-
                bitious floating
                workers is re-
                cruited constant-
                ly from our boys

                        the boy scouts
attack that prob-
lem we encour-
age boys to find
the thing they
can do and like to do we award
merit badges for proficiency in almost
every thinkable occupation scouts
learn by doing-they grope about un-
til they discover the thing for which
they are best suited we supply the
incentive that is lacking in the schools
to a boys determination of a career
a life work

bring them all in

and so this national boy scout
 week originating as a tribute has
acquired a greater significance its
purpose now is to enlist you person-
ally as a booster for the boy scouts-
to induce you to do all you can to bring
into the movement some of the millions
of boys who would derive help and
benefit from membership it is designed
to make the movement better known-
known as a great and vital force in the
molding of good citizens and such em-
phasis as will be laid on the work the
scouts did during the war will be by
way of proving the value of the move-
ment to the country-a value which can
be at least as great in time of peace as
in a period of national emergency

for sound practical
reasons and the best
use of your money
why not make an at-
tempt to verify the
facts before deciding
whether you will
spend two or three
thousand dollars for
an ordinary automo-
bile or invest in a
twin six packard
with all that a packard
can give you

sfthe man who owns one

transportation facts

are established

  he may get lightness at the expense
of safety or dragging weight at a heavy
up-keep charge

  if he gets power when he wants it lie
may have to pay for it when he doesnt
use it

  while passenger cars were bought as
luxuries alone it was difficult to get con-
sideration for the facts

  just as today the average automobile
for family use is a compromise an ama-
teur job from the standpoint of scientific
transportation its advantage in one di-
rection offset by loss in another

  when corporations buy packard cars
for the transport of their executives
there is something for the average car
buyer to think about

  that is the result of expert analysis of
all the factors it is a matter of business

  when will the purchase of the family
car be regarded as a business transaction

  the packard people are transportation
experts they can tell you more on this
subject than any other organization in
the world you can ask them to discuss
your car problem without obligation
it is to your interest and profit to do so

leading transportation
expert has said that most
automobiles are built on
theory and bought on per-
sonal opinion

  transportation is now a science it is
a science that applies to your own car
whether it carries you across the conti-
nent or merely from your home to your
office or serves your family or friends
in their daily activities

  it would astonish the average car
owner to see a scientific test of his car
in its relation to the whole question of
transportation

  we say the whole question because
advantages are claimed and economies
cited for certain parts of a car or special
phases of the question

  it is only by treating the problem as a
whole that we get the facts

  for example a man may have his eye
filled by economy of gasoline and tires
and he may throw away more on engine
tinkering than he saves on both these
items

  he may get speed at the cost of vibra-
tion that racks and wrecks his car

if a roofing stands the fierce heal
of the blow lorch without damage
it is for every practlal purpose
fireproof

asbestone is the only low-priced
roofing tha meets this test

why we emphasize
popular price in this roofing label

because heretofore quality alone has been the standard by which
johns-manville roofings could be judged in relation to ordinary
roofings

price or first cost has been the one factor on which cheaper roofings
could rely and undoubtedly thousands of buyers have denied themselves
the splendid durability of a johns-manville asbestos roofing because of
its apparent expensiveness

for years johns-manville has been working to produce an asbestos roll
roofing that would provide the weatherproof fire retardent qualities
that asbestos alone can give at a price that would meet the widest
popular demand the result is

approved by underwriters laboratories

a johns-manville roofing of asbestos rock fibre waterproofed with
natural asphalts being all mineral it cannot rot or disintegrate and
therefore does not need painting or costly refinishing

stone roofs dont burn

no other ready roofing can give you
the fire-protection of johns-manville
asbestos asbestone is the only low-
priced roofing that will stand the famous
blow-torch test this fact alone has
placed asbestos roofing on thousands
of even temporary structures where fire
meant big risk to production programs

furthermore it does not dry out because
the natural asphalts bound between the
asbestos felts insuring a permanently
waterproof and flexible roofing are
sealed and shielded from the suns heat
by the very insulating properties of the
asbestos felts themselves in asbestone
roofing the felts protect the water-
proofing

that is why asbestone never needs
coating or costly refinishing add to
this its qualities of weatherproof per-
manent durability-and it is easy to see
why asbestone is fast becoming the
most popular roofing in america

russias rough riders

the cossacks

they may help to restore order in russia

by nikolaki p zarokilli

recent reports coming out of the
russian confusion have listed the
ural cossacks among the forces acting
with admiral kolchaks siberians and
the ukrainians against the bolsheviki

  i am sure the cossacks-that pic-
turesque body of warriors who so large-
ly contributed to the formation of the
vast russian empire-will prove potent
factors in reestablishing order for the
cossacks though they have in the course
of centuries lost most of their savage
characteristics retain all their virile
qualities through generations of con-
stant turmoil and fighting in which
many a tribe was extinguished to the
last man through centuries of devas-
tating wars wrought by mongols tatars
turks muscovites poles or swedes
the cossacks have emerged a vigorous
race ready to assimilate the culture
offered by peaceful and settled times

  beyond the common coupling of the
words cossacks and cavalry and
a vague belief in traditional tales of
cossack cruelties and horrors thanks
to exaggerated one-sided reports writ-
ten invariably by people with a personal
grievance against russia and published
largely for their sensational value the
general public has little idea of these
people as they exist to-day but i have
had the good fortune to live among
the cossacks for several years and
have seen them in peace war and
worse than war - revolution - and i
know them as a humane patient peace-
loving people law-abiding and extreme-
ly loyal to their country

civilized bandits

a little incident that occurred
while i was visiting my sister and
her husband in their summer home in
the kuban cossack district of north
caucasus brought me my first appre-
ciation of this they sent to the sta-
tion to meet me vasili their cossack
coachman with a troika three-horse
carriage vasili and i were old friends
for on my previous visits i had often
sat with him for hours by the fire lis-
tening to his stories of the fights against
the caucasian tribes the cherkesses
the kabardians chechenzes daghes-
tanis and others or of hunting trips
for deer boar bison or bear his
accounts were always exaggerated and
his knowledge inaccurate but there
were poetry and enthusiasm in his tales
and i had learned to gauge their value
as we drove off in the troika he drifted
into his favorite subject-horses-and
began praising the three in front of us
calling them by name and with much
the same deference one uses in refer-
ring to ones own kind mishka the
center horse was getting rather old
and shortsighted but he was vasilis
favorite and possessed extraordinary
qualities we were gradually entering
the woods as vasili went on explain-
ing the intelligence of mishka and the
discipline of the other horses and why
the middle horse should be bigger and
trot while the side horses should be
smaller in size and gallop with their
heads bent low down and away from
the center one all three work said
vasili but there is a leader who is
responsible for the whole set like a het-
man and his aids

  rapt in this conversation we saw
but too late three men spring at us
from the thick bushes on either side
one in front of the troika tried to hold
the horses while the two others steady-
ing themselves on the gnarled roots of
the thick bushes pointed their pistols
at us there was but one thing to do
and that was-to surrender instead
vasili murmured something to the
horses and they plunged forward with-
out stopping the man in front of us
fell to the ground the troika capsized

and in the turmoil we made our escape
through the bushes vasili afterward
explained to me that mishka would
never have responded but for his de-
fective eyesight

  that same evening however five
cossacks of the neighborhood appeared
at our home they expressed their re-
gret that such a thing should have
happened in their district and asked
us to come and identify the robbers
whom they had caught two hours after
the news of the holdup had spread in
the village the robbers were turned
over to the police that night but this
is not an uncommon occurrence the
cossacks whose very name kazak
springs from the word quzzag of
tatar origin and meaning bandit vol-
unteer always to catch thieves and
bandits in their own districts and in
such cases one may rest assured that
the results are satisfactory

  i have never been able however to
overcome a feeling of looking upon the
cossacks as an anachronism they
seem still to belong to the dark ages
of mongol invasion-they are fierce-
looking individuals and one easily im-
agines them dragging off a mutilated
man at the end of their arkan lasso
or stabbing a mongol with their spear
there is something almost uncanny in
hearing a cossack converse in excellent
french or english on the most up-to-
date topics and with manners a diplo-
mat should envy and i will never for-
get the astonishment of two americans
whom i introduced to a cossack friend
one day in tiflis whose views on the
municipal government of new york
were sound enough for a candidate
for mayor

  the cossacks are of veliko-russian
malo-russian and polish origin with
an admixture of lithuanian and tatar
blood and are of the greek ortho-
dox church originally there were
two groups the don cossacks who
acknowledged the sovereignty of russia
in the days of ivan the terrible and
the dnieper cossacks gradually their
limited occupations of piracy and pas-
turage developed into agriculture and
from the two groups were formed the
ural siberian volga  terski gre-
bentsi terek-semeini kuban ukrain-
ian and zaporozhian cossacks fierce
and brave fighting in all directions at
first conquering land joining moscow
and adding that domain to that of their
sovereigns rebelling and fleeing from
their masters and conquering new ter-
ritories they gravitated in the long run
to the ever-increasing power of russia
adding bit by bit to the land of the
tsars and in the end became an inte-
gral part of the empire

the djighitovka

it will be however upon their justly
celebrated skill as cavalry that the
cossacks will depend most in helping
to restore russia once more the
djighitovka will come into its own
and those cossacks who for years
have kept up the famous fancy riding
will feel rewarded for their endless
reviews and exhibitions the
djighitovka is the logical outcome of
the perfect mastery of the art of riding
and only in practice can its significant
usefulness be completely revealed i
was discussing this point once with
colonel dragomirov the son of general
dragomirov a cossack himself and at
the head of the convoy of the viceroy
of the caucasus to prove a point he
invited me to attend a review of
the convoy held for the benefit of a
few guests

  about one hundred cossacks clad in
reddish uniforms and silver trappings
cartridge cases belts and saddle fit-
tings with soft white fur caps topped

built-up layer

upon

copyright s by the goodyear tire  rubber co

layer

just how important is the layer-upon-layer construction
which goodyear employs in the manufacture of tubes

does it make them stronger - longer-lived - better con-
tainers of air

well for nine years we have been building balloons and
dirigibles in the construction of which our first and most
complex problem was that of inflation for gas is volatile
much more elusive than air harder to capture and hold

it was finally demonstrated however that rubberized fabrics
built up layer-upon-layer formed the most practical container
for this gas

once this fact was established it seemed quite logical that
the same principle should prove even more successful when
applied to tubes for a tubes sole function is to hold air

we thus evolved the goodyear heavy tourist tube making

it of pure gum strips building them up layer-upon-layer then
curing them together after which the valve-patch was vul-
canized in

the soundness of this method was immediately established

the thin layers of rubber cured one upon the other enabled
the elimination of all defects such as sand holes and porous-
ness this construction also gave the body of the tube a
criss-cross grain which prevented splitting if punctured
finally by vulcanizing the valve-patch securely into the
tube we prevented all leaks at this source

there is an observable tendency among motorists every-
where to use goodyear heavy tourist tubes exclusively

they have learned that the slightly added cost of these thick
grey tubes is more than justified by their longer life and by
the protection which they undeniably give to casings

more goodyear tubes are used than any other kind

with red and silver rode by us six
abreast at a slow pace singing their
weird war songs-the same singing that
harassed and unnerved the retreating
armies of napoleon until it became a
nightmare to them

  like any other cavalry they were
dignified and warlike but they lacked
the ultramilitary bearing of ordinary
cavalry they were absolutely at ease
and unconscious of the effect they pro-
duced there is nothing of the human
being on horseback in their appearance
they seem rather a composite being like
the centaur of old a hussar an uhlan
or a dragoon suggests soldiery of this
or that category that one can vision
walking into a drawing room or riding
in parade but a cossack seems more
like a man-on-horseback absolutely in-
divisible when seen walking in a street
one feels as if he had left his legs be-
hind and one marvels that he can walk

  as i watched them ride by my first
feeling was one of admiration they
thrilled and impressed me and then
i found myself hoping that i might
never have to meet them as adversaries
they stopped a few hundred yards away
and commenced a more active display
of their riding skill one rider gal-
loped off alone and when he came in
front of us fell from his horse pre-
tending to be wounded the horse
stopped at once and looked around a
if to summon help until another cos-
sack was sighted galloping toward the
wounded man the latter raised his
right arm and was lifted to the saddle
by the second rider still in full gallop
the horse of the wounded cossack
unattended clung to the other horse
and the two galloped off as one the

wounded man was stretched across the
saddle and the rescuer standing on
his left stirrup bent over his comrade
and covered him with his burka raw-
wool waterproof cape soon we could
see both horses galloping as one and
without riders

 for the charge the cossacks were
divided into two groups about one verst
two-thirds of a mile apart the first
group dismounted and stood in front
of us representing the enemy the
other group were still one verst away-
the signal was given and they started
shooting from both sides the cossacks
rode full speed against those in front
of us but after a little shooting we no-
ticed fewer and fewer riders on the
galloping horses the effect was per-
fect for soon we could see a few hun-
dred yards away only riderless horses
galloping into the enemys camp the
firing was relaxed by the enemy until
the horses came to within a few hun-
dred yards and then we saw a puff of
smoke at the right side of each horse
and heard a volley that seemed to come
from invisible rifles for the next shot
the cossacks were all on their horses
again and into the camp of the enemy

 where cavalry counts

the cossacks provide their own
horses their arms consist of a
short rifle a dagger called a kinjal
and a revolver the officers carry
swords in addition to the revolver and
kinjal but no rifles always ready to
be called to the front each individual
cossack is a unit of soldiery of the
highest value whose importance cannot
be overestimated in the present condi-
tion of russia

distinguished as administrators of men
and of women

  the number of these committees and
their diversity suggest at first a fever
of reconstruction i was told but
look into any one of them and you will
find a real problem for instance take
this report of a meeting-that of the
committee on fisheries it is brought
out that in scotland alone  fisher-
men went off to war and the admiralty
converted to its own use more than 
power craft used in the fishing indus-
try does the reinstatement of this in-
dustry present a problem and do you
not see that it demands a separate
and distinct committee to consider
and solve it

  there are three outstanding activi-
ties however which call for the interest
of americans the first of these is the
new development of the department of
science and research war caught the
british a little unprepared in the arts
of destruction the experience of their
climb out of this hole by the aid of sci-
ence and investigation-the taste for
achievement born of new methods and
devices learned since war put pressure
upon them-has resulted in a new na-
tional zeal to apply the same resource-
fulness to the arts of construction when
peace has come says the commercial
and industrial policy committee we
find that in long-established manufac-
tures with the important exception of
the iron and steel trades british indus-
try had shown vitality and power of ex-
tension but that in the rise and expan-
sion of the more modern branches of
industrial production the united king-
dom has taken only a limited share
certain branches of production had
come to be entirely or very largely un-
der german control the department
of science and research will play an
important part in restoring british
manufacturing versatility

  those who have been working on in-
dustrial and commercial reconstruction
all say that progress can be left no
longer in the hands of private initia-
tive there must be cooperation under
the governments wing the depart-
ment of science and research must put
the blood of new ideas into the respecta-
ble successful unimaginative body of
british industry

  one of the needs is the stimulation
of new industries the british intend
to pick up some of the work which
had been in german hands to study
the exact problems of the production of
specific manufactures there are in ex-
istence already fifteen or twenty com-
mittees among which those which deal
with the chemical trades and with the
conversion of the munition plants to
new uses are the most important
everywhere it is asserted that in this
new development of industry the gov-
ernment is the only agency which can
act efficiently in procuring the proper
supplies of raw materials

the d o t

so also is the feeling as to the govern-
ments function in the opening up of
britains markets i have been told by
many officials and manufacturers that
after all we americans have an exag-
gerated idea of what is being done to
stimulate british foreign trade the
old individualistic tendency still comes
out as when a member of one of eng-
lands most successful families said to
me oh yes the officials are going
ahead there was a feeling that the
foreign office was not keeping a clear
eye on our chances in the worlds com-
merce so it was arranged that the
board of trade and the foreign office
should have a joint department with a
joint secretary to go out after new
fields but after all we will not fol-
low their work very closely a manu-
facturer will go on-just as human
nature is built-to send his own repre-
sentatives to china or south america
to make his own investigations and his
own deals

  the department to which he refers is
called the department of overseas
trade-the d o t familiarly it is
the expression by british of a desire for
new foreign markets but before the
peace conference settles the untangling
of the joint shipping control and the
allocation of shipping the departments
hands are somewhat fettered never-
theless it has engaged rather quietly
if you please in a multitude of plans
and its feelers are reaching out touch-
ing the remote places of the earth it
will probably remain and grow as the
third leg of a reconstruction tripod of

flat tires are merely an incident when there is a detroit crankshaft tire pump in the tool-box

- it goes wherever the car goes-

your free air station is right with you all the time -
pressure is always up

make and model
of your car

in the first place it attaches to the right place on
the car-the crankshaft-where there is unlim-
ited power-where there is no danger of inter-
fering with the operation of the engine or the
water pump and where there is entire freedom
from oil contamination of the air pumped

in the second place it is built like the motor
itself-strong simple and serviceable

and

in the third place it is easily and in-
stantly attached-fits nicely into the tool-box
and is always ready for action - will outlast

super-size in cord

and fabric

sterling super-size
tires are all cured on
air-bags the cord or
regular woven fabric is
thoroughly impregnated and
coated with pure rubber of
highest quality we use
much more rubber in and
between the layers and more
layers than is usual the
plies or layers are built up
one by one on iron cores the
pure gum cushion is added 
then the breaker strip then
more  cushion   then the
super-tough long-wear
vacuum bar tread when
built the tire is transferred
to an air-bag of our own con-
struction placed in a mold and
the bag forced full of highly
compressed air the molds
go into steam vulcanizers for
the long three and four hour
cure heat further ex-
pands the air in the bag inside
the mold and the resulting
tremendous pressure com-
pletely amalgamates all the
layers

  independent laboratory tests show
that the strain necessary to pull the
sterling layers apart is from
double to several times as great as that
called for in united states govern-
ment specifications adhesion of the
layers is what mainly determines the
life of a tire and it is this adhesion
and the extra thick tough vacuum
bar tread that accounts for the re-
markable mileage records we are re-
ceiving daily

  sterling tires are guaranteed
 miles but double and triple that
mileage is not at all surprising

invention manufacture and marketing
for the new british commercial program

  with plans for conservation of re-
sources for industrial development for
finding markets the world is familiar
they have none of th significance
which is expressed in the phrase a
new world after the war in the brit-
ish reconstruction program these plans
may show how the wind blows with the
british they may indicate that some-
thing of the self-content of a stolid
british trade has been jounced out of
comfort by the war they may speak
of a nation better prepared for de-
fense for self-sustaining resource and
for offering a diversity of wares to the
outer world but it is only in the re-
construction plans which touch the de-
velopment of human resource that the
american visiting the british catches
the odor of a new world after the war

a ministry of health

first there is human health the
british have come to the conclusion
that this is no longer a local business
they are going to treat it as a na-
tional business they are going to
create a ministry of health

  it has been a shock to them to find
out as they have found out in the last
month that the birth rate of the civil
population has been passed by the
death rate and that  children
die every year in spite of the fact that
under proper care  could be
saved they are going to have a cen-
tral national agency to gather up the
functions concerning health which
were under the board of education
the poor law administration the
home office the insurance commis-
sions or in local governments they
are going to add to them other powers
they are going to treat the national
health as the business of the nation
for instance when the question of in-
fant mortality-a vital question to a
fading population-comes up under the
new minister of health he will have
the powers and functions described in
the bill as certain powers and duties
of the board of education as to the
health of expectant and nursing mothers
and young children of the powers and
duties of the privy council in relation
to midwives and of the powers affect-
ing infant life protection under the
childrens act of  the ministry
of health will deal with the questions
of the health of the men who have been
in the war it will deal with health in-
surance it will have a number of
consultative councils of men and
women who will deal with the subjects
of prevention of disease cure of dis-
ease questions affecting motherhood
including pensions relief and protec-
tion of working mothers questions as
to the national health insurance

  the next reconstruction measure
which strikes fire upon an american
is the british national plans for housing

  it is a far cry from our american
attitude toward the housing of our-
selves to the critical situation which
exists in countries where for more than
four years the building of living quar-
ters has been stopped the decay of old
quarters has marched on vast areas
of dwellings have been destroyed by
war and the population has crowded
into the centers the british have faced
a serious situation and they are going
to make the most of it they are plan-
ning the housing of a nation anew one
of the interesting outcomes of their
plans is the disclosure of the fact that
queen mary has been a close student of
the housing problem for several years

  the solution of the housing problem
has been undertaken by several com-
mittees i was told there is an im-
portant body of experts who are work-
ing out the emergency problem brought
on by the war there is a committee
which deals with the cooperative build-
ing societies one which has reported
on the extension of government con-
trol of rents and mortgage interest an-
other composed of women which has
undertaken to find out what the work-
ing woman wants for a dwelling

  the number of persons living more
than two in a room in  before the
war was more than  in eng-

june  

land and wales more than half a mil-
lion were living more than three in a
room the shortage of houses in rural
districts too before the war was so
marked that agricultural laborers were
being drawn to the cities in the coun-
try there was a lack of  dwell-
ings f the shortage of industrial la-
borers houses due to the stopping of
building during the war in itself will
amount to  dwellings we can
realize little of the british housing
problem until we know that it will be
necessary to build  houses in the
centers and  in the country dis-
tricts

  the program of building carried out
must be without delay it must be in
accordance with new and better dwell-
ing design and workmanship and the
houses must be built in the right locali-
ties this is the nations business now
and in it the british face the dilemma
that landlords will not build houses
when the cost of building is  per cent
above normal-unless the government
subsidizes building the objections to
this subsidy are so great that the state
itself has been advised to go into the
house-building and renting business
wherever the local authorities will not
do so

  one important benefit that will
come from house building as a public
business is the new opportunity which
exists for town planning said the
committee member to me the grant
of aid by the state will give power to
insist upon town planning and housing
architecture the financial aid is suffi-
ciently large to bring about this gov-
ernment control because if 
houses must be built at once the state
will probably have to grant aid to the
extent of about one-fourth of the total
money needed-which is about -


  as to the quality of the houses to be
built the womens housing committee
has reported that the working women
of the united kingdom have asked for
larger houses with a wider frontage
to insure more light and air situated
in better surroundings and that a par-
lor should be provided in addition to
the living room where meals are served
and that bathrooms with a simple sys-
tem of hot and cold water supply should
be provided in separate inclosures
that the health authorities should pre-
vent a house designed for one family
being used by more persons than are in
that family that where there are no
sewers there should be no more than
four dwellings to an acre

  the work which lies before the brit-
ish to provide housing for the nation is
indeed a gigantic task but out of the
emergency brought by war there is an
awakening of the national imagination
as to the national welfare

quality knowledge

this same quality of imagination has
arisen as to education the em-
phasis is not for the moment on the
extension or reformation of the educa-
tion of the child we have just learned
that education does not stop within the
old conventional limits the head of the
largest trade-union organization said to
me out of the war has come a finger
pointing to the need of vocational and
adult education

  in other words the british have
awakened to the fact that men and
women need to know their jobs and
secondly that education is not some-
thing to take like the measles and
having made a recovery in childhood
be immune for a lifetime

  said lord haldane who has led work
of educational reconstruction commit-
tees from the working classes we
hear of the requirements of a new mini-
mum wage and a minimum standard of
living that is right but there is a
minimum quite as important as either
and that is a minimum of knowledge-
not merely abstract knowledge but the
knowledge of quality

   in the british plans for reconstruc-
tion there are schemes for the special
education of the agricultural worker
for special education of women in the
work they are to undertake for the
training of the children who have been

yl new national average
io miles to the set of tires

a nation-wide investigation among franklin
owners has just been completed it covered all types
of the present model which have been driven day by day
for over two years in every part of the country the
results show a delivery of over  miles to the complete
set of tires

    when in  the present chassis was put on the
market it was known that its lighter weight would give
greater tire economy yet former figures of  miles
were not changed in franklin statements of performance
until owners results were available franklin statements
are based on facts not on estimates

    this newly proved economy is just fresh evidence as
to why the franklin car leads with the fastest growing
sales and resales of any fine car

    delivering frequently more than is quoted for it and
always more in comfort and everyday usability than the
average car franklin performance drives home this fact
only franklin light weight flexible construction and
direct air cooling no water to boil or freeze give motor-

forced into employment during the war
for training the domestic servant

  the attempt to introduce adult edu-
cation however has brought forth
most dramatically the need for adult
education and also the obstacles to its
application men and women demand
education after maturity because of a
desire to understand better the world
in which they live and the forces with
which they contest or with which they
advance their conditions says a letter
from the committee on adult educa-
tion something of this is seen in the
voluntary labor school the humble
the poor and the educated want to
know before the war there were near-
ly  adult schools with a voluntary
membership of nearly  the
workers educational association last
year had about  branches and out
of this came the cooperation of our uni-
versities which started some hundred
and fifty assisting classes with over
three thousand students pledged to
carry on a three years course of study
the attempt of the reconstruction
authorities to extend adult education
has given the british a new insight into
the lives of the workers and this is
because adult education is blocked by
social facts which a mass of evidence
from the workers themselves has laid
on the table of the educational commit-
tees the picture is one of no time and
no energy for study i have been a
student for ten years said a railway
checker but my hours have hindered
me after twelve hours of work it is
hard to concentrate a colliery la-
borer testified you generally find the
collieries are outside of town we get
up at about three oclock and arrive
home at six education is difficult

education or the mob

the shift system rises in startling
antagonism to education too an-
other colliery worker said we have
the three-shift system when there are
three or four workers in a house per-
haps all are working on different shifts
during the same week so the women
folks in the house simply live to get
meals and the shift worker himself
can only attend evening classes one
week out of every three overtime is
another obstacle-i had two hours
overtime every day said a man in a
white-lead plant and rising at six
and coming back at nine-thirty didnt
leave me much strength to study the
only time i found to read was in the
half hour allowed for breakfast at the
works under a dirty arch and near
a refuse heap i managed to learn
something in connection with what i
learned in the class

  for reasons based on testimony of
this kind i found that the committee
on adult education dealing with the
problem of education for adult laborers
has made one recommendation out of
eleven which dealt with education it-
self that one advised that village
halls for classes and meetings should be
provided wherever the public authori-
ties were in control all the other ten
had to do with working hours the de-

jun e  

pletion of workers energy with hous-
ing and such matters as the provision
in all plants of a place to wash ones
hands

  but we will overcome the difficul-
ties said the labor leader who has
enlisted in the government campaign
for adult education it is education
or the mob that is the way it looks
in some parts of the world the brit-
ish will choose education

  the gigantic task for the british
just now in fact lies in the job it
is the man and the woman and the
job or the lack of a job all in capi-
tal letters

 a new after-the-war world

imagine the problems-you who
are back home in america with a
social and economic fabric not all torn
to rags as the british fabric has been
chewed up and raveled out by four and
a half years of war what would you
do with all the boys and girls who
have gone to work and will see their
jobs fade away what would you do
with the six thousand new women
workers in the farmerette class the
land army as the english call it
when the men who want work on the
soil came back from france how would
you dispose of the future fortunes of
the million and a half women who went
out of the home and into the job when
war called

  what will you do with the endless
streams of men returning from war
how will you find work or education for
the officers who have become used to a
scale of living based on their pay and
who now nerve-racked or now re-
minded that war interrupted their edu-
cational training try to find jobs that
will support new tastes and new wives
and new babies

  how will you take care of the muni-
tion workers before other work starts
up what will you do to work out a
plan to take care of the unemployed
and to get people out of the cities where
war has herded them and to make capi-
tal and labor work out their differences
together around a table instead of sepa-
rately in contest when a nations nerves
are still weary and war-edged

  these are a handful of the problems
of human labor which the british are
working out some of them are
emergency problems but behind the
dealing with them all there is the spirit
and the practice of this permanent new
world after the war of which w have
talked so much it is the one signifi-
cant experiment in reconstruction going
on in a world which is talking its head
off about idealism while the british-
the supposedly stolid unimaginative
british-are actually sawing wood no
matter what its errors may be it is the
one example of well-ordered national
reconstruction based on realization of
the need to conserve human resource
and rearrange the pattern of life in the
name of social justice and as a guar-
anty against the dripping-mouthed mob

  it is a brand of idealism not for
export but for consumption on the

question

  but there is no use in talking about

poland reborn

 therein lies the strength and the
 future of the thing so strictly for-
 bidden no farther back than two
 years or so of polish independence
 expressed in a polish state it comes
 into the world morally free not in
 virtue of its sufferings but in virtue
 of its miraculous rebirth and of its
 ancient claim for services rendered to
 europe

   not a single one of the combatants
 of all the fronts of the world had died
 consciously for polands freedom that
 opportunity even was denied to polands
 children and it is just as well provi-
 dence in its inscrutable way had been
 merciful for had it been otherwise the
 load of gratitude would have been too
 great the sense of obligation too crush-
 ing the joy of deliverance too fearful
 for mortals common sinners with the
 rest of mankind before the eye of the
 most high

   those who died east and west leav-
 ing so much anguish and so much
 pride behind them died neither for
 the creation of states nor for empty
 words nor yet the salvation of general
 ideas they died neither for democ-
 racy nor leagues nor systems and not
 even for abstract justice which is an
 unfathomable mystery they died for
 something too deep for words too
 mighty for the common standard by
 which reason measures the advantages
 of life and death too sacred for the
 vain discourses that come and go on
 the lips of dreamers fanatics humani-
 tarians and statesmen

   polands independence springs up
 from that great immolation but po-
 lands loyalty will not be rooted in any-
 thing so trenchant and burdensome as
 the sense of immeasurable indebted-
 ness of that gratitude which in a
 worldly sense is sometimes called eter-
 nal but which lies always at the mercy
 of weariness and is fatally condemned
 by the instability of human sentiment
 to end in negation polish loyalty will
 be rooted in something much more solid
 and enduring something that could
 never be called eternal but which is
 in fact life-enduring it will be rooted
 in the national temperament which is
 about the only thing on earth that can
 be trusted

   men may deteriorate they may im-
 prove too but they dont change mis-
 fortune is a hard school which may
 either mature or spoil a national char-
 acter but it may be reasonably ad-
 vanced that the long course of adver-
 sity of the most cruel kind has not
 injured the fundamental characteristics
 of that nation which has proved its
 vitality against the most demoralizing
 odds the various phases of the polish
 sense of self-preservation struggling
 among the menacing forces and the
 no less threatening chaos of the neigh-
 boring powers should be judged im-
 partially

    i suggest impartiality and not indulg-
 ence simply because when appraising
 the polish question it is not necessary
 to invoke the softer emotions a little
 calm reflection on the past and the
 present is all that is necessary on the
 part of the western world to judge the
 movements of a community whose ideals
 are the same but whose situation is
 unique

   this situation was brought vividly
 home to me in the course of an argu-
 ment more than eighteen months ago
 dont forget i was told that poland
 has got to live in contact with germany
 and russia to the end of time do you
 understand the force of that expres-
 sion to the end of time facts must
 be taken into account and especially
 facts such as this to which there is no

june  

possible remedy on earth for reasons
which are properly speaking physio-
logical a prospect of friendship with
germans or russians even in the most
distant future is unthinkable any alli-
ance of heart and mind would be a
monstrous thing and monsters as
you know cannot live you cant
base conduct on a monstrous concep-
tion

  we are either worth or not worth
preserving but the horrible psychology
of the situation is enough to drive the
national mind to distraction yet under
a destructive pressure of which west-
ern europe can have no notion of forces
that were not only crushing but cor-
rupting we have preserved our sanity
therefore there can be no fear of our
losing our minds simply because the
pressure is removed we have neither
lost our heads nor yet our moral
sense

  oppression not merely political but
affecting social relation family life the
deepest affections of human nature and
the very fount of natural emotions has
never made us vengeful it is worthy
of notice that with every incentive pres-
ent in our emotional reactions we had
no recourse to political assassination
arms in hand hopelessly or hopefully
and always against immeasurable odds
we did affirm ourselves and the justice
of our cause but wild justice has
never been a part of our conception of
national manliness in all the history
of polish oppression there was only one
shot fired which was not in battle
only one and the man who fired it
in paris at the emperor alexander ii
was but an individual connected with
no organization representing no part
of polish opinion the only effect in
poland was that of profound regret
not at the failure but at the mere fact
of the attempt the history of our cap-
tivity is free from that stain and what-
ever follies in the eyes of the world
we may have perpetrated we have
neither murdered our enemies nor acted
treacherously against them nor yet
have been reduced to the point of curs-
ing each other

  i could not gainsay the truth of
that discourse i saw as clearly as
my interlocutor the impossibility of the
faintest sympathetic bond between po-
land and her neighbors ever being
formed in the future the only course
that remains to a reconstituted poland
is the elaboration establishment and
preservation of the most correct method
of political relations with neighbors to
whom polands existence is bound to
be a humiliation and offense calmly
considered it is an appalling task yet
one may put ones trust in that na-
tional temperament which is so com-
pletely free from aggressiveness and
revenge

  therein lie the foundations of all hope
the success of renewed life for that
nation whose fate is to remain in exhe
ever isolated from the west among hos-
tile surroundings depends on the sym-
pathetic understanding of its problems
by its distant friends the western
powers which in their democratic de-
velopment must recognize the moral
and intellectual kinship of that dis-
tant outpost of their type of civi-
lization which was the only basis of
polish culture

 an imperishable individualism

whatever may be the future of
russia and the final organization of
germany the old hostility must remain
unappeased the fundamental antago-
nism must endure for years to come
the crime of the partition was com-
mitted by autocratic governments which
were the governments of their time
but those governments were character-
ized in the past as they will be in
the future by their peoples national
traits which remain utterly incompat-
ible with polish mentality and polish
sentiment

  both the german submissiveness
idealistic as it may be and the rus-
sian lawlessness fed on the corrup-
tion of all the virtues are utterly
foreign to the polish nation whose
qualities and defects are altogether of
another kind tending to a certain ex-

a heroic tire contest on  packard buses going
 miles a month

no more convincing proof of a tires supremacy has ever been submitted to
the court of public opinion it comes from the private tests of the eldorado
stage company los angeles cal theyre one of the largest users of
tires in the world to them it meant a huge sum of money to establish which
tire carries a heavy load lightly and runs the farthest

   twenty-two leading makes of tires were tested on the eldorados seventeen
-passenger packards they travel an average of  miles daily-a combined
distance of  miles a year thats more than  times around the world

proof of uniform mileage

   this is the service de luxe for which
the miller tires competed and won their
victory was based-not on exceptional mileage
of a single casing-but on long distance uni-
formity tire after tire

   once the burro was the only transportation
where today this grand fleet carries thousands
of passengers between los angeles bakersfield
and taft here nature has painted with lavish

aggeration of individualism and per-
haps to an extreme belief in the gov-
erning power of the free assent the
one invariably vital principle in the
internal government of the old re-
public

  there was never a history more free
from political bloodshed than the his-
tory of the polish state which never
knew either feudal institutions or
feudal quarrels at the time when
heads were falling on the scaffolds all
over europe there was only one politi-
cal execution in poland-only one-
and as to that there still exists a tradi-
tion that the great chancellor who de-
mocratized polish institutions and had
to order it in pursuance of his political
purpose could not settle that matter
with his conscience till the day of his
death

  poland too had its civil wars but
this can hardly be made a matter of
reproach by the rest of the world
conducted with humanity they left be-
hind them no animosities and no sense
of repression and certainly no legacy of
hatred they were but an argument
in a political discussion and tended al-
ways toward conciliation

the offspring of the west

i cant imagine in whatever form of
democratic government poland elabo-
rates for itself that either the nation
or its leaders would do anything but
welcome the closest scrutiny of their
renewed political existence the diffi-
culty of the problem of that existence
will be so great that some errors will
be unavoidable and one may be sure
that they will be taken advantage of
by its neighbors to discredit that living
witness to a great historical crime if
not the actual frontiers then the moral
integrity of the new state is sure to

be assailed before the eyes of europe
economic enmity will also come into
play when the worlds work is resumed
again and competition asserts its power
charges of aggression are certain to be
made especially as related to the small
states formed on the territories of the
old republic and everybody knows the
power of lies which go about clothed in
coats of many colors whereas as is
well known truth has no such advan-
tage and for that reason is often sup-
pressed as not altogether proper for
everyday purposes it is not often rec-
ognized because it is not always fit to
be seen

  already there are innuendoes threats
hints thrown out and even awful in-
stances fabricated out of inadequate
materials but it is historically unthink-
able that the poland of the future with
its sacred tradition of poland and its
hereditary sense of respect for the
rights of individuals and states should
seek its prosperity in aggressive action
or in moral violence against that part
of its once fellow citizens who speak
ruthenian or lithuanian the only in-
fluence that cannot be restrained is
simply the influence of time which dis-
engages truth from all facts with a
merciless logic and prevails over pass-
ing opinions the changing impulses
of men

  there can be no doubt that the moral
impulses and the material interests of
the new nationalities which seem to
play now the game of disintegration
for the benefit of the worlds enemies
will in the end bring them nearer to
the poland of this wars creation will
unite them sooner or later by a spon-
taneous movement toward the state
which had adopted and brought them
up in the development of its own humane
culture-the offspring of the west

 been established for the trained blind
 and of which more hereafter

  at the opposite extreme from the
exalte type is the man whose affliction
has left him profoundly and bitterly
depressed with such cases it is a
question of getting the subject in time
before he has slumped too far in prac-
tically every instance this has been -
done

  the very atmosphere of evergreen
 goes far to accomplish it to pull the
 man out of his slough of despond
 by the mere influence of the prevalent
 pluck and optimism and set him on firm
 ground almost without his realizing it
 as the shrewd and helpful blinks did
 with the despairing gob in whom i wit-
 nessed the miracle of the rebirth of
 manhood at the moment when the
 handicapped man begins to take an in-
 terest in life again his start is made
 from the time when he feels himself a
 part of the little community with com-
 mon interests and common enjoyments
 he is on the upgrade once he sees
 ahead of him clearly a useful produc-
 tive place in the world and sets to
 the task of fitting himself for it he
 i is safe

   therein is the reason why officially
 blind means so much to these young
 fellows it places them in a sense it
 puts them to the test it is the honor
 of their fraternity to make good in the
 world

   there is a third type affording a more
difficult problem the patient who re-
covered from the physical shock of his
wounds remains bewildered anxious
timid a helpless traveler in a strange
land of which he knows neither the
highways nor the customs of life here
the danger is that he may fall into the
apathy of self-distrust and become a
mere inert tragic dependent upon the
government pension which gives an
ample income to those blinded in the
service

   he will unless carefully handled be-
 come institutionalized mentally and
 physically cramped within the walls of
 this or another refuge but the whole
 trend of the evergreen training is
 against this result the blind men are
 subtly and constantly incited to look

out beyond the institution to think and
plan in terms of the outside world and
to prevision themselves always as natu-
ral and normal participants in the ac-
tivities of life thence arises a paradox
the inmates are devoted to evergreen
yet their keenest wish is to get through
with it and out into the main cuirent
of life

they ask no odds

what do they expect to do there
in a word they expect to work and
be paid for it to play and enjoy it and
to ask no odds of life in any respect
when i was asked to visit evergreen
the best that my imagination could do
with the blind man as an economic
factor was to picture him as a piano
tuner or perhaps a freak musi-
cian or selling pencils or newspapers
on a street corner to sympathetic
patrons

  the evergreen graduates are not go-
ing to do a street-corner trade in pity
though some of the musically inclined
may become expert tuners there has
been compiled at evergreen a long and
still growing list of gainful occupations
practicable for the blind and this
does not include any job that the sight-
less man can do just as a makeshift
and on sufferance either he can learn
to do it as well as or better than the
average sighted man or they wont
waste their time on his teaching it to
him at evergreen because when one
faculty is lost the others intensify
themselves automatically to compensate
for it blind people become naturally
more expert than the sighted at cer-
tain pursuits piano tuning telephone
receiving and many forms of the more
delicate manual labor where keen sense
of touch comes into play under the
guidance sometimes of the staff some-
times of the blind themselves i saw the
patients learning typewriting taking
dictation from the dictaphone making
furniture testing and inspecting trac-
tion chains adjusting electrical mech-
anism making molds for small iron
and aluminum castings poultry rais-
ing practicing horticulture dairy farm-
ing bookbinding and busying them-

suburban deliveries

of

crowleymilner  co

          this store has established deliveries throughout the cities
      and on the roads indicated by the above ynap

 i

          if you live beyond or near the cities indicated by crosses
       you can arrange lor delivery at some point within the city and
       you can pick up your packages there if you wish to do so

         we are glad to make deliveries on the indicated roads
      but we cannot for the present make deliveries on any other
      roads this is because the cost is tremendously increased when
      the delivery car must leave the paved roads indicated our
      idea is to sell goods as low as we possibly can a foo-liberal de-
      livery system is very often a severe tax in increased prices on
      the customers of a store

          in the case of large purchases of household goods we will
      extend the foregoing limits a little figuring that the size of the
      purchase takes care of the delivery cost

         will our suburban customers please take care that the
      clerks get their names and addresses correctly-and with as
      much detail as necessary

blinded cicerones was at the time com-
pleting his course in anatomy and mas-
sage at johns hopkins medical school
and already had invitations to estab-
lish himself in half a dozen of the
larger cities where leading medical men
wanted him not from any sentimental
or sympathetic feeling but for the
thoroughly practical reason that he
bids fair to be the best-trained and
most scientific masseur in the country
and they need him in their practice

the victory store chain

the most ambitious and far-reach-
ing of th evergreen projects is the
victory store chain the plan is backed
by a body of business men as a busi-
ness venture promising a good return
on their investment and the stores
will be established to start with in
a number of cities each store to be
under the management of a blinded sol-
dier or sailor with a stock interest in
the concern and a share in the profits
besides his salary special business
training is given him he has a
sighted assistant preferably a crip-
pled man from one of the other recon-
struction hospitals there is to be a
central buying organization forall the
stores enabling them to get the benefit
of liberal discounts but the local man-
ager dictates and is responsible for the
policy and success of his own store if
he has a wife fiancee or sister who
wishes to go into the business with
him she may come to evergreen and
take a special course at the expense of
the red cross institute for the blind
in store management bookkeeping and
salesmanship

  the stores will be standardized so
that a manager who has served his
time in the model at evergreen or
one of the two proving grounds in
baltimore will know his way about in-
stinctively to whatever store in what-
ever city he is assigned the stock
will be standardized so far as possi-
ble mainly package goods cigars to-
bacco candy newspapers and maga-
zines stationery and specialties also
articles handmade by the blind at ever-
green and in other institutions the
general policy will be to handle nation-
ally advertised articles all-the-year-
round goods and stock making a quick
turnover each store will be an object
lesson to the public a local proof of
the fact that the blind man properly
trained needs no pity and asks no odds
he wants only a fair show above all
he wants to be regarded not as a freak
an abnormality not as a blind man
but as an ordinary human being who
happens to be blind

setting the example

tlinks is the name they have
xj given to themselves at first the
authorities were dubious about it they
suspected in the jaunty slang an ele-
ment of bravado a touch of bitterness
but they did not interfere it is the
virtue and wisdom of the evergreen
system not to interfere presently it
developed that the term held for those
who had made it their own a peculiar
significance it was an expression of
solidarity the shibboleth of the offi-
cially blind it implied something
more than the mere loss of sight upon
the full-fledged blink devolved a pride
of behavior he must be cheerful
amenable adventurous to try new ex-
periments confident of his place in
the scheme of things determined and
optimistic

  it is his caste mark not only to dis-
regard his handicap but so to bear
himself that others shall forget it
thus he justifies his sacrifice sight-
less he must fit himself to look the
world in the face

  to aid and inspire him in attaining
this standard a remarkable and de-
voted staff has been gathered together
by the combined army medical depart-
ment and the red cross it is they

ing an almost perfect plant

  and for what the training of a
mere handful of men for happily
the number of americans who made to
the war cause the greatest sacrifice
short of life itself is inconsiderable
less than two hundred total economi-
cally so great an outlay of money and
personal effort as that represented at
evergreen could hardly be justified
were the work to cease with the edu-
cation and reestablishment of these few
sufferers since it could be reasonably
argued that an equal expenditure would
achieve greater benefit to a much larger
number along other lines such as re-
claiming consumptives in the early
stages for example but it is not in-
tended that the scope of the work
should be limited to the blinded men
of the service what each man when
he graduates to his place in the world
of action will represent is not only
the rehabilitation of the individual but
also an object lesson to the public and
a proof that there is a chance in life
for the most tragic class of helpless
and joyless folk alive the eighty thou-
sand disregarded victims of blindness
scattered about and pushed aside in
forgotten nooks and corners of the
country

  except in a few enlightened and pro-
gressive state institutions mainly de-
voted to children nothing has been
done for these sufferers they may
fiddle at country fairs and we will of
our charity toss a dime  i the cup
they may squat on city corners and
we will stop long enough to buy a pair
of shoe laces which we do not want
beyond that we cannot be bothered
thinking of them no one thinks of
them except the kind of practical ideal-
ists who make up the working force
of evergreen they are now thinking
into the future when all the present
undergraduates of the place shall have
completed their courses and have taken
their place in the outer world then
automatically the duties of the surgeon
generals office of the war department
will conclude but the red cross can
continue and intends to continue with
those eighty thousand darkened lives to
draw from for material

june  

sid the corporal a blink since ten
years ago she knit for seven years
until shed knit everything there was
for everybody she knew and then she
just lay back and got ready to die
didnt have anything to do but die
i reckon surmised sergeant zim

  thats it the war saved her life
all right she turned out stuff for the
red cross and belgian relief so fast
that they wouldnt believe one person
could do it all and so good that they
used it as models to work by shes
been the happiest old girl you ever saw
since the war

  sure assented the marine its
having a job to do that keeps you
going

  a job with some real use to it thats
what gives you a hold on things
amended cal did you guys ever
think he pursued in that hesitant and
semiapologetic tone wherein youth pro-
pounds its philosophy that we never
stopped to think whether we were go-
ing to be any use in the game before
we got bumped anyway i didnt
there was a murmur of assent

  but now that im a blink pur-
sued the philosopher gaining assur-
ance ive got the honest-toil bug the
worst way id go batty sure if i
couldnt work for my living

  theres the twenty-five per any-
way observed a voice referring to
the governmental weekly pension to the
totally blinded

  cal said something violent and quite
unjust to the governments liberality

  what good is it to you when you
dont have the feel of working for it
demanded buck and capped his chal-
lenge with a reminiscence i used to
go to school with a gink whose folks
were rich they gave a fourth of july
picnic and he was running the fire-
works he rubbered into a set piece
to see why it didnt go off and it did
curtains for poor old benny well
they bought him an automobile and
they bought him a sail boat and they
took him on trips and they bought him
a guide to trot him around and they
did everything for him but teach him
a job so on his twenty-first birthday
he went up to the bathroom and got
hold of the wrong bottle of tooth wash
and it happened to be a chloroform mix-
ture and i was a bearer at the funeral
it was an accidental death the coro-
ner said so

  of course assented the group so-
berly

  now if we could have had him here
commiented the marine

 sure said jake he wouldnt
have made that mistake about the
bottles-here

rounding up the blinks

there was a sound of hard breath-
ing from the edge of the circle where
sat the gob i judged from my vantage
point in the conservatory that he was
thinking back a few hours and that
there were fear and shame and relief in
his thought his face was the face of
one who suddenly sees in visible form
the evil spirit that was cast out of him
when i get home announced cal
im going to round up all the blinks i
can find and tell em about this place
whats the good asked jake
they wont take em here unless
theyre in the service they cant
ill bet they will asserted cal
when we get out theyve got to
they arent going to lay down on a
big job like this when its only just
started anyway this is my college
and im going out to give the yell and
toll the people in

  well fellow blinks-zim got up
and stretched his powerful clean-built
form preparatory to delivering himself
of the inevitable and threadbare jest of
the service which is so much more than
a jest because of the solid conviction
underlying it-its a great life if you
dont weaken

  they dont weaken not the blinks
they are going out with a gospel for
their afflicted fellows a gospel of self-
support self-dependence self-respect
for in this new dispensation if the
blind lead the blind both shall come
to the goal
the eclipse
handicap

continued from page 

  all of which is interesting omar
said until it begins reaching out for
the remains of my auto money then
i get into it and you can hear me yell-
ing for miles

  at this point harmony encountered
his first rough sledding because omar
refused flatly to have anything to do
with the tia juana enterprise our
leader argued threatened cajoled and
pleaded he pointed to the fact that
the plan was an open-and-shut cinch
wherein we stood no chance to lose a
cent we entered our horse put down
our bets at a hundred to one or may-
be better and then automatically col-
lected our winnings it took four
hours at the end of that time little
omar moaned piteously and signified
that he would pay our expenses down
to tia juana

  why you talk as if i was borrow-
ing money from you harmony said
sharply when it was over i am
about to make a fortune for you and
you ought to be down on your knees
thanking me	

  hurrying over the preliminaries we
shipped gallops in a commodious box
car and left oakland in the same shar-
ing it with the horse because omar de-
clined to buy us regular transporta-
tion on that trip omar found an-
other genuine worry

  did you ever think- what a small
horse gallops is he demanded of
harmony

  whats that got to do with it
harmony asked they dont judge
horse races by the size of the horse
i know omar grunted but were
going to race our horse on a day when
it gets dark hes a small horse and
if this eclipse gets too durned dark and
if the finish is anyways close maybe
the judges wont be able to see him
where would we be then with my
money up hey suppose some large
high horse gets between the judges
stand and gallops and its pretty dark
what then

  you can certainly find a lot of orig-
inal things to fret about harmony re-
plied this is an eclipse were talking
about-not a midnight affair eclipses
make things partly dark

 why doesnt it occur to
 some car owners that
 guesswork is ancient
 history around a motor car

    they ought to know that sol-
  dering a leak is a risky job the
  high heat of the soldering torch
  weakens the radiator if the leaks
  are hard to get at they are never
  repaired right and after laying up
  the car for three or four days-
  and paying a bill alywhere up to
   - what guarantee is there
  that the radiator wont leak
  again-soon

    in addition to the economy of it
  -an x liquid repair is quicker
  and more scientific than soldering
  it gets to the places that solder
  cant reach whether there is one
  leak or a thousand-whether these
  leaks are in the radiator pump
  connections gaskets water-
  jacket etc-x liquid makes
  a permanent repair in  minutes

    and if x liquid is left in the
  water it positively prevents future
  leaks everywhere in the cooling system

improves engine performance-
reduces upkeep costs

   the same x liquid left in
  the water after the leaks are re-
  paired loosens the rust and scale
  already formed x absorbs all
  the free oxygen in the water and
  prevents new rust from forming
  it also prevents the lime and
  magnesia in the water from de-
  positing scale on the metal walls

   in this way x keeps the
  narrow water spaces free and
  clean it eliminates considerable
  over-heating it helps the motor
  work much better it reduces
  the consumption of oil and helps
  get more mileage from gasoline

 not a radiator cement

     dont confuse x liquid with radi-
  ator cements flaxseed meals and other
  dopes in powder or liquid form-
  many of which clog the cooling system
  and ruin it x is a scientific process

we arrived in tia juana without
adventure unloaded gallops with
care and stored him away in a stable
with a competent attendant and then
sat around to wait for three oclock on
the afternoon of thursday the th of
august when it became noised abroad
that gallops was entered by h childs
in the empire handicap which was
the official name of the race the san
diego newspapers indulged in humor-
ous comment and the race fans grinned
derisively entering gallops in a race
was regarded as the equivalent to pour-
ing gold coins over niagara falls

  harmony engaged a capable boy to
give our popeyed steed a daily workout
and as this occurred in broad daylight
there was no chance that our precious
secret would leak out of the automo-
bile money omar still had something
over four hundred left i remember
that the races were largely attended
that year betting was heavy and the
ring was full of prosperous bookmak-
ers with everything looking bright
and cheerful omar continued to fret

  yeah but just how dark will it be
he asked harmony repeatedly and
nervously

  just like it gets at dusk our
leader replied what for do you keep
on pestering me about that

  because gallops is so all-fired lit-
tle omar insisted and likewise be-
cause all this dough which we are about
to wager is the sole remains of my
automobile i was fond of that auto-
mobile and id like to buy it back
some day

 an eclipse harmony explained
gently is a partial obscurity of the
sun producing a semi-daylight condi-
tion bordering on dusk it is different

from nighttime it will be just dark
enough for gallops to run one of his
high-speed races and that means we
cash in without further ado now say
no more

  all right omar returned but i
could see that he was still anxious in
spite of repeated assurances

  you know how it is george he
confided to me as the fateful th
drew nigh its all my money and
its all of it if we lose that four hun-
dred were cooked i dont want that
horse overlooked by any near-sighted
judges in case the finish is a close one
i added my solace to the words of
harmony and so the situation drifted
along until thursday morning was
upon us

of course the previous racing rec-
ord of our entry was known to the
fraternity and on thursday we had
to stand for fresh joshing also on
thursday morning our first bit of
hard luck dropped in for a call the
jockey employed by harmony in the
regular way to ride gallops fell off
a stable roof and broke his leg har-
mony heard the news and started at
once to locate another jockey because
if we failed to get gallops into the
three aclock race we would have to
wait for the next eclipse and eclipses
are none too plentiful anywhere

  i likewise hurried hither and yon
looking for a rider but it was omar
who trotted into the stable along to-
ward noon towing behind him a green
jockey named schwartz whom he had
dug up in san diego he was a dough-
faced looking individual but he was a
jockey

  can you ride a horse harmony
asked looking him over with a doubt-
ful eye

  sure said schwartz complacently
if i cant ride a horse then nobody
cant i only weigh ninety-six pounds
and ninety-five of it is below your
chin too harmony commented staring
hard at omars find however we
have got to have a jockey go in there
and get acquainted with gallops

  i suppose omar said some time
later that you want me to bet every
dollar of the cash we have left
certainly said harmony how
much is there

  about four hundred and a quarter
the three of us will split that and
spread it thin over the ring har-
mony went on gallops is always a
hundred to one so it makes between
forty and fifty thousand we win

  its all right said omar only
weve got to remember that gallops is
a mighty small horse and this is my
last four hundred remember that
we got a fine chance of forgetting
it i said a little peevishly a fine
chance

  i	remember now that some time that
morning between nine and noon omar
was mysteriously missing and i
searched for him in vain he reap-
peared at lunch and his nervousness
seemed to have gone he spoke of the
approaching race with something akin
to confidence and when it came time
for him to unbelt and share the morjey
with us so that we could spread it
over the ring he did so without a pro-
test it was entirely unlike omar

  as for harmony that urbane gent
was acting as though the race was al-
ready run and we were standing in line
in some good bank waiting for the man
to change our fortune into large bills

  theres a nice summer hotel up at
monterey that ive had my eye on for
a long time he said cheerfully we
can buy that place for about twenty
thousand dollars and its an estab-
lished money maker id like to go into
the hotel business for a year or two
id like a home myself omar
agreed my idea of heaven is to live
in a room costing twelve dollars a day
and not be charged anything for it

the three of us watched the early
races with but languid interest
harmony gave the final instructions to
schwartz and they were indeed simple
and comprehensible to the most ele-
mental natures schwartz was merely

to sit on gallops and hit him with the
whip when the race began sending
him out in front of the other five
horses and keeping him in that rela-
tive position for the entire mile and
a quarter there was no finesse or
generalship demanded of schwartz
which was a good thing

  hit him with the whip and then
keep on hitting him was harmonys
parting command and after schwartz
promised to do so the three of us de-
scended upon the unsuspecting betting
ring to take forty thousand dollars
away from those sharks in human form

  the scheduled eclipse came along
just as announced in the newspapers
and from noon on it grew darker stead-
ily it was that queer unnatural
darkness that is slightly like evening
but not quite and it gave precisely
the sort of lighting arrangement that
suited our race horse by the time the
empire handicap came around you
could just see from the ring up to the
stands and harmony rubbed his hands
with the joyous self-appreciation of a
man who knows his worth

  on every book poor old gallops was
a joke entry and his price was one
hundred to one except in a few cases
where you were allowed to bet three
or four bucks at two hundred to one

i	hurried from book to book laying my
wagers and off in the distance i could
see harmony and omar doing likewise
about five minutes before the horses
stepped out to face the barrier the
three of us got together in the grand
stand and after discussing the figures
with me and omar harmony took a
piece of lead pencil and a program and
figured that we won forty-three thou-
sand dollars

  in cash harmony said gleefully
thats the best of it real money to
buy things with

  the barrier then went up suddenly
the race began and there is no need
for a painfully detailed description of
it because it worked out precisely
as harmony planned when the six
horses jumped away from the barrier
gallops sort of volplaned into the air
and when he landed on four feet he
was the seventh part of a mile out in
front of those hounds and was already
a winner anyone could see that

  now said harmony turning to
omar you can see for yourself that
this eclipse isnt as dark as you feared
there is no chance that the judges will
overlook gallops

  you said a hatful admitted omar
theres one thing i am sure of

we watched the parade as it dashed
by the grand stand with our night-
running wonder out in front and going
like a runaway comet all around us
were exclamations of surprise with
people asking each other if that was
gallops leading and then the shocked
answers in the affirmative we saw
the procession disappear into the
murky turn with our noble steed in-
creasing his lead and the other beetles
bunched far behind

  in the betting ring the shylocks
watched the miracle and we could hear
their profane lamentations up in the
stand we waited patiently for the
spectacle to emerge from the eclipse
and dust into the home stretch and
when the runners once more appeared

i	saw with glad content that gallops
was leading by the length of a rifle
shot it was all over

  harmony freed himself of a joyous
cheer and omar unbelted a yell of
triumph i was just on the point of
making some noise on my own hook
when i turned and gazed down on the
track i then saw something that has
never been beaten in the annals of
american race tracks with my mouth
wide open in readiness for the unyelled
yell i saw that young mr schwartz our
substitute jockey had burst into flame
as it were he was surrounded with
an aura of light and came down the
home stretch like a salvation army
christmas tree around his neck there
glowed a row of electric bulbs casting
their radiance hither and yon lighting
up the scene most effectively and call-
ing the judges attention to the fact

 aids digestion

rapid eating keeping the brain
constantly at work during meal
time and bad cookery-these
lay the foundation for the conditions
that nine out of every ten americans
suffer from the food is imperfectly
masticated there is an insufficient
flow of saliva and the inevitable re-
sult is seen in the various mild forms
of indigestion with which we are all
familiar

  under such conditions there is
nothing better than the routine use
of my original pepsin chewing gum
it stimulates the salivary glands in-
sures sufficient saliva relaxes nerve
tension and aids the digestive proc-
esses

  thousands have avoided minor
digestive troubles by the simple ex-
pedient of chewing beemans pepsin
gum for ten to twenty minutes after
each meal

that schwartz and gallops were now
winning a horse race

  gallops came down the stretch to
the wire bedecked with twinkling lights
and passed under the wire ten good
lengths in front of the second horse

  there was a surprised murmur in
the stand because none of those hard-
boiled racegoers had ever before wit-
nessed a lit-up jockey coming home on
an illuminated horse i glanced over
toward harmony childs and beheld a
pitiful sight he was clinging weakly
to a pillar and had turned the color
of fresh ashes a few seats off omar
gill arose with a glad brisk smile
gave vent to a shriek of triumph and
started down for the betting ring in-
tending to begin the collection of large
sums of money

  there was a terrible shindy down
on the track a moment later with at-
tendants attacking schwartz and drag-
ging him from his mount the as-
tounded judges sent for our jockey and
shrieked at him harmony and i crept
into the crowd and when schwartz be-
gan to talk to the judges it was clear
enough he stated briefly that mr
gill part owner of the horse had or-
dered him to wear a wiring system and
pocket battery and to turn on the juice
coming down the stretch

  what for yelled an astonished
judge

  sos youd be sure to see me said
schwartz and then they pulled him
off gallops and disqualified him

on modern race tracks there is a
strong prejudice against jockeys and
horses carrying a full electric equip-
ment so the officials took about a min-
ute to rule gallops out of that race en-
tirely it was just the same as though
he had never run they gave the em-
pire handicap to a skate named phelo-
pian which had finished a block behind
our night runner harmony had the
blind staggers at this point and i led
him around behind the stand and into
the yard where the cars start for san
diego omar was nowhere so was
our forty-three thousand dollars

  on the way back to the hotel where
we owed quite a bill harmony slunk
back in the corner of a seat with an
unlighted cigarette drooping from his
lower lip he looked as miserable as
i felt

  george he said finally as we ap-
proached town when omar was a
boy he fell off a high bridge nothing
saved his life but the fact that he fell
into the water which was about nine
feet deep he hurt himself quite a bit
and it was too bad

  too bad he hurt himself i asked
in surprise

  no said harmony too bad there
was any water in that river

  then we got off the car and walked
into the hotel just three meals away
from death by glow starvation

metal the garden was sleepy pow-
dered with dusty gold sunlight and
sweet with the scent of flowers there
was a faint breath of air from the sea
presently signor pug and miss diego
wandered away and sat on the rim of
an old fountain and splashed each other
and laughed cavanaugh was left
alone with his victim diego drawing
his chair closer offered him a cigar
and asked his advice-would it be bet-
ter to ignore the revolutionary element
or did mr cavanaugh think it wiser
to attack cammarillo before his army
had assumed dangerous proportions a
ticklish business and so much at stake
-the prosperity of the country many
lives foreign prestige

  as a distinguished american diego
said a man of science a thinker-
what do you advise

  cavanaugh groaned strike he
almost shouted kill that dago before
he kills you hes dangerous i know
what im talking about

  he got to his feet and swayed bal-
anced on his trembling legs like a gro-
tesque scarecrow he had put his hand

in his coat pocket and had found that
his revolver was still there for an in-
stant he saw the gracious white-whisk-
ered president through a mist signor
pugs back was turned there was
nothing to prevent the firing of the
historical shot which would rid magella
of-of a benevolent dictator nothing
that is save a burning in cavanaughs
breast

  suddenly he shouted in a strangled
voice say lets get out of here
im sick

pug tore himself away from the fas-
cinating miss diego and running to
the fur merchants side possessed him-
self of his arm very affectionately
murmuring excuses and sympathy he
steered mr cavanaugh biologist and
athlete through the garden past the
astonished barefooted sentry at the
palace gate and into the piazza then
he led him still more firmly to the cafe
albion haunt of sports and official
faultfinders and sat him down at a
table signaling instantly for two tall
glasses of something cool

  cavanaugh he said you are a
genuine native son i took a chance
on you being an amateur psychologist
and a believer in the yankee golden
rule trust a man and youve chained
him hand and foot now let me see

  cavanaugh put it on the table its
short one hundred dollars and fifty-
seven cents i bought passage on the
liberia sailing to-morrow morning to
rio i was going back to philadelphia
-out of this awful hole im no dago
im a white man this country has
swallowed me swallowed me

  cavanaugh shoved the cool drink
aside with a single violent gesture of
his fat hand and burst into tears 
signor pug whistled softly would
you know cammarillos agent if you
should see him again

  cavanaugh lifted his head and skill-
fully recovered the drink no they
all look alike to me these patriots
these liberty-loving conspirators im
through ive had enough of it im
sailing to-morrow-with the money
no youre not im going to fill the
hole in that ten thousand and you mr
cavanaugh are going to jog back-
country and pay your debt to cam-
marillo you can tell him that there
was some mistake his agent took you
for a half-breed-owing to your coat
of tan and pleasant ways you can
tell him that philadelphia gave you
birth that your middle name is obrien
and that your hair is red

  cavanaugh rubbed his hand across
his polished dome and who are you
he demanded

  my grandmother was born on chest-

cavanaughs story if there were no
truth in the proverb which explains

ney to the lips

mounted on a languid mule cava-
naugh left magella at nightfall
when the city lay wrapped in purple
shadows fireflies glittered in the gar-
dens and guitars and concertinas made
sweet music in the narrow streets he
rode through the old indian trail where
the brand-new rails of the american
railway glowed like two platinum
threads then up toward the plateau
of the marias his destination lay be-
yond the farthermost railway camp in

why germs breed

on your teeth

all statements approved by high dental authorities

they breed in a film

  the teeths great enemy is a slimy
film you feel it with your tongue

  the tooth brush doesnt end it so
millions of people who brush teeth daily
do not prevent tooth troubles

  that film is what discolors not your
teeth it is the basis of tartar it
holds food substance which ferments
and forms acid it holds the acid in
contact with the teeth to cause decay

  dentists call it bacterial plaque
because millions of germs breed in it
they with tartar are the chief cause of
pyorrhea thus most tooth troubles
are caused by that film

  the film is clinging it gets into

crevices hardens and stays the or-
dinary dentifrice doesnt dissolve it
that is why brushed teeth so generally
discolor and decay statistics show that
tooth troubles have been constantly
increasing

  dental science has long sought a way
to combat that film it has now been
found convincing clinical tests by able
authorities prove this beyond question
leading dentists all over america now
urge its use

  the method is embodied in a denti-
frice called pepsodent - a delightful
product and to quickly make its action
known we are offering to millions a
ten-day trial tube

a ten-day test amazes

  pepsodent will do its own convincing
just ask for this free tube watch its
effects then look at your teeth in ten
days the book we send will explain to
you all the unique effects

  pepsodent is based on pepsin the
digestant of albumin the film is
albuminous matter the object of
pepsodent is to dissolve it then to con-
stantly combat it

  pepsin alone is inert it must be
activated and the usual method is an
acid harmful to the teeth so pepsin
long seemed debarred but science now
has found a harmless activating method
patents have been granted by five gov-
ernments already that method used
in pepsodent is fast bringing about a
new era in teeth cleaning

  you should find this out you have
found that old methods do not end
this film find now a way that does

send the coupon for a -day tube

use like any tooth paste note how
clean the teeth feel after using mark
the absence of the slimy film see how
the teeth whiten as the fixed film

disappears

     

  do that for ten days if the results
delight you get them always and
teach your children how to really clean
their teeth you will find folks all about
you who are doing that today

to fool magella he was going back
when he had paid his debt

  on the evening of the third day there
occurred the slip cavanaugh rode at
dusk into the railway camp at dora
riparia it was saturday and the
fairchild companys employees had
poured into the camp from the moun-
tains from the plains from the sur-
veying partys farthest location to cele-
brate to get drunk and to make the
night hideous with song the single
street of the improvised town was
trodden into a morass of mud by indi-
ans half-breeds italians portuguese
yankees slatternly women from the
seaboard black-haired urchins strings
of mules and huge creaking carts
driven by shouting mozos in the en-
gineers quarters a tin-throated canned
mccormack sang mother machree
further along cavanaugh passed a
dobe house through whose open door
he glimpsed various familiar comfort-
ing and tempting things-a bar many
men leaning on it in attitudes of re-
laxation a table where there was card
playing and at the back of the low
long smoky room a piano-a sure-
enough civilized american piano

  i stop here he said

  he tied his languid mule to a ma-
gellan hitching post made of bamboo
poles and propelled his fat self and
cammarillos ten thousand dollars into
that magnetic place within ten min-
utes he had stripped the wad of two
crisp brand-new notes and was hold-
ing a handful of greasy cards in the
widespread fingers of his fat hands a
cigar was fixed between his teeth the
consuls hat hung on the farthermost
peak of his glistening head and behind
him wide-eyed silent tense a crowd
of chocolate adventurers watched the
play the tropics had got him again

the next morning when signor pug
clattered into camp the engineer in
chief hailed him from the office door
there was an anxious line between his
eyes more trouble he explained
briefly another american fellow
named cavanaugh lost ten thousand
dollars at the pace last night and then
shot up the place

  where is he

  the chief jerked his thumb over his
shoulder inside

 cavanaugh was sprawled in the
chiefs desk chair more dead than
alive he opened a blackened eye and
groaned swallowed he said in ex-
planation

  pug smiled no he answered it
was the lotus wheres the wad cava-
naugh

  gone

  he sat quite still for a moment con-
templating the tips of his yellow shoes
oh gawd he exploded suddenly
what next i cant go on and i cant
go back both ways im done for

 pug sat down on the edge of the
chiefs desk and swung his feet quiet-
ly he contemplated mr cavanaugh and
he saw beneath that hairless polished
skull a cherished vision of home-sweet-
home-neat rows of red-brick houses
with white doors decorous streets trol-
ley cars parks-cavanaughs promised
land well he said suddenly i guess

i	can stake you again this time ill
write a check begging your pardon
im not suspicious-only cautious

 no cavanaugh shouted waving
his arms im not going to pay an
imaginary debt to a half-breed lover
of liberty like cammarillo no ones
honest in this country a true magel-
land murder his mother for a dime
you cant break into society unless
youve robbed a bank or cheated an
orphan and youre asking me to ride
into cammarillos camp with a harp in
one hand and a check for ten thousand
dollars in the other suddenly cava-
naugh spat through the open window
you sound like little lord faunt-
leroy he said

  pug laughed and you sound like
a full-blooded black-haired shifty-
eyed greaser-no good sounds are
deceiving if they werent id be wear-
ing curls and a red sash and youd be
sporting a stiletto up your sleeve there
are two good reasons why youd better

pay up you didnt kill president diego
and youre a white man what dyou

say

  theres no bait cavanaugh de-
manded with suspicion other than
that 

  no

  then ill go-because im afraid not
to youre finding it pretty expensive
-making a purified saint out of h e
cavanaugh you think theres some-
thing decent in me youre beating the
tambourine before the gates of heaven
youre howling a hallelujah saved
me ive forgotten how to play square
im done give me that check wheres
the mule

pug offered cavanaugh his hand but
the fur merchant refused it he
stuck his heels into the big mules sides
and clattered through the main street
of dora riparia out of the settlement
and up the stony treeless trail to the
plateau cavanaugh knew his magella
years before bearing that precious
cargo of furs he had taken this path
into the savage interior now a fallen
angel he traveled it again and be-
hind him there were ten years of bitter
idleness consuming sun and devastat-
ing thirst he had slept in the dirty
sand of the esplanade beach like a
homeless mongrel he had begged bor-
rowed stolen and bribed he had not
dared to lift his eyes to the flag hang-
ing above the consulate he had learned
how to roll a cigarette with one hand
and to curse in three languages-ital-
ian spanish and tapadas beyond
that his education had not progressed
he had been lonely he had watched
the burning days kindle into rose
flicker and fade into night he had
listened to the singing of a thousand
love songs the dull kerplunk of a mil-
lion falling coconuts the ceaseless hiss
of tiny fluted waves against the beach
day was like day and night like night
and his hate had grown in him burn-
ing like a flame in his bosom outcast
failure exile swallowed

  he reached the plain and struck off
toward the south following a faint trail
which led to cammarillos rancho one
night he slept in the bush grass with
his head on his saddle he dreamed
he wore a salvation army bonnet and
trod the sanctified macadam of the
quaker city he woke and found tears
on his cheeks

late that afternoon he spied the
i hacienda-a sun-baked place in a
sparse grove of undernourished trees
a dozen peons ran out to meet him but
he galloped past them straight into the
courtyard of cammarillos house

  the liberator he shouted where
is he

  cammarillo was asleep in the patio
he sat up with a start instantly awake
like a cat when he saw the fat ameri-
can mounted on a mule his first thought
was ah he wants more money
we shall see he got slowly to his
feet and went forward with a sly smile
of greeting

  cavanaugh grinned for the moment
he was looking down on the terrible
revolutionist the chocolate terror of
magella he cavanaugh had some-
thing to say it would be unpleasant
listening for that stone-eyed half-breed

  well cammarillo asked is it
done gringo

  then something happened to the soul
of h e cavanaugh a sort of unholy
pride welled up in him and suffocated
him he felt his heart bursting and
his lungs shrieking for air he saw
stars he smiled a twisted smile and
putting his hand into his breast pockct
drew out pug fairchilds check for ten
thousand dollars

  payable to you amigo cavanaugh
said did you think you cross-eyed
unwashed ignorant evil-smelling pie-
faced mongrel of satan that you could
bribe a philadelphian

  cammarillo stepped back a pace his
eyes closed a shiver passed down his
body cavanaugh waited erect and
braced with a look of profound ecstasy
then quietly almost lovingly cam-
marillo raised his arm smiled and
shot cavanaugh through the heart

         everybody can now afford

dr eliots five-foot shelf of books

        a new popular edition the cambridge

for several years we have been at work improving printing proc-
esses-devising new and more efficient methods of producing good
books - and reducing costs here and there
while raising the quality of our product to accom-
plish this we called to our aid the ablest minds in
the mechanical world

   we were convinced that the cost of standard well-
made books could be decreased without sacrifice of
high quality to a point where every man could afford
to buy the best literature

   we have succeeded in doing this by a develop-
ment of efficiency in every line-by the adoption of
time-saving and labor-saving methods by production
on a large scale and by economical methods of dis-
tribution and sale

   the first result of these improved methods is a
popular edition of the harvard classics commonly
known as dr eliots five-foot shelf of books

   if you do not own the harvard classics now is
the time to obtain a set of the new popular edition
at a price that puts this famous library of classics
within everybodys reach

   this new low-priced edition contaiis every chapter every page every
word that is fozmd hi the expensive de luxe editions it differs only

in illustrations and bindings

   it is printed from the same clear-cut plates that
were used in printing the celebrated de luxe edition

                                                                      

   the popular edition is well-made handsomely
and substantially bound and is worthy of a place
in any library

 this edition is dr eliots own idea

   in publishing this edition of the harvard classics
we are carrying out dr eliots idea of the place this
library should permanently hold as an educational
influence

   he intended the harvard classics for the millions
of men and women who are busy doing the nations
work-professional men office men farmers salesmen
mechanics-for readers who have no time to read a
roomful of books to gain a clear perspective of the
worlds thought and achievement

dr charles w eliot

the worlds civilization on a bookshelf

  that is a sweeping statement-the worlds civil-
ization on a bookshelf-to be used in describing a
set of books

   it is not our own phrase one of the readers of the
harvard classics used it in writing to us about the set

   but sweeping as it is it is true in the sense in
which he used it

   every powerful idea that has ever moved the human
mind is to be found in these volumes

   it is a collection of books that has no parallel in the
history of literature because it is the product of a plan
to present in the limits of a single bookshelf a series
of volumes which would show the complete develop-
ment of the human intellect

   it is not merely a collection of great books printed
in uniform binding without coherence or system

every part of the library bears a relation to every
other part

   every book play poem or article in the set is com-
plete in itself it contains no unsatisfactory chopped-up
extracts

   you may read here in one volume darwins epoch-
making theory of evolution told in his own words
then here are the finest examples of the greek come-
dies full of the genuine humor of this great people
next the arabian nights that eternal collection of
never-old tales - and there are the subtle ideas of
descartes the father of logic - the essays of mon-
taigne - the best books of the bible the koran
and the sayings of confucius-adam smiths famous
wealth of nations the foundation of the science
of political economy - and there are shakespeare

goethe milton burns the worlds great poets - the
biographies of the intellectual leaders of the human
race and -

   the table of contents alone would fill several pages
the best way to learn all about the set is to write
now for our

  this book describes the	harvard classics and

gives dr eliots own official	statement of the plan of

is well worth reading
