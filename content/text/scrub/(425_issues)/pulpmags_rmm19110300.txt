 whims of the wheels

by charles frederick carter

wherever things are continually on the move-as they are along the
right-of-way-there are hound to be enough cuts and shuffles in fates
great game to turn up any number of quaint and amusing incidents
in this respect railroad men above all others have little cause to complain of
the monotony of daily routine

    the odd the humorous and the unexpected are always cropping up on
the trains iu the yards and all over the length and breadth of a great system
mr carter who as you all know is a veteran railroader has gathered a few
of these tales of travel ranging in their scope from maine to california all of
which ring as true as a sound wheel though some are as weird and marvelous
as stories from the arabian nights

humorous situations narrow escapes queer encounters freak ac-
cidents and other peculiar happenings both
off and on moving trains

 young western couple took it
 into their heads to elope in
 the month of roses and wed-
 yjbqbjk dings several years ago

            they boarded a train on
the southern pacific and got
out into nevada when they decided that
the wedding ceremony simply could not be
postponed another minute accordingly
they wired ahead for the agent at winne-
mucca to procure a license and a justice of
the peace for them

  having been taught that it was his sacred
duty to please the patrons of the road the
agent immediately procured the license

 rr	

being a justice of the peace himself he
was ready to do his duty and boarded the
train before it had come to a stop at the
station platform

  meanwhile the dining-car had been
cleared of tables and chairs and the bridal
pair was waiting the chef and a couple
of waiters with mandolins and guitars
played the wedding-march the agent read
the service the conductor gave the bride
away and then the pullman passengers in
their capacity of wedding guests sat down
to the best the car could afford

  pitched in a different key was an in-
cident that occurred in the same month and


the railroad mans magazine

year on the louisville and nashville near
birmingham alabama about four oclock
in the morning a coach full of dozing pas-
sengers was suddenly roused by a series of
blood-curdling shrieks when they looked
for the cause they found a woman perched
on the back of a seat staring with protru-
ding eyes at the floor beneath when she
was able to explain she said she had felt
something squirming between her feet and
upon investigating found it was a six-foot
rattlesnake the whole car-load instantly
concluded that it could hear further par-
ticulars to much better advantage from the
backs of the seats so the change of loca-
tion was accordingly made while a hurry
call was turned in for the train crew

  the conductor and two brakemen broke
open a tool-box from which they armed
themselves with axes sledges and saws
the rattlesnake whose sensibilities had
been hurt by the unseemly conduct of the
passengers put up such a spirited fight that
the interior of the car was in ruins before
it was finally despatched the mystery of
its presence was explained by a telegram
awaiting the conductor at the next station

  it was from the owner of the snake say-
ing that his prize had escaped from its
box and that he had not discovered his
loss until after leaving the car would
the conductor please take good care of it
what the conductor said need not be re-
peated here such things should be for-
gotten

close shaves with the reaper

  passengers who have been pluming
themselves on their adventure in the new
haven coach which in the month of june
 jumped the rails while running
twenty-five miles an hour bounced along
on the ties for a few car-lengths and then
flopped over on its side without hurting
any one will be taken down several pegs
on learning that their experience was noth-
ing when compared with an incident that
occurred march   at columbus
ohio

  a big four freight-train had stopped
on a crossing when a baltimore and ohio
passenger-train mistaking or disregarding
signals or perchance misled by a wrong
signal dashed between two cars pushing
them apart wide enough to make room for
the passage of the train with no harm to
anything except the varnish on the coaches

and the draw-bars on the box cars no
one was so much as scratched after the
danger was over the fireman realized that
he should have jumped and as he had
always been told that  its better late than
never he forthwith proceeded to jump
score one broken jaw

  this was completely outdone however
on august   when a passenger-
train on the great northern near darts
washington fell through a bridge which
had been burned by a brush fire to the
ground forty feet below without killing
or fatally injuring any one

  even this pales into insignificance when
compared with the feat of another great
northern train a freight which on may
  ran into a push-car which a con-
tractors gang tried too late to hustle in on
a siding this trifling affair probably
would never have been heard of if there
had not been over a ton of dynamite on
the push-car

  as it was the locomotive was blown
completely off the track everything was
stripped off the boiler a great kole was
torn in the road-bed several box cars a
steam-shovel and a trackmans shanty
seventy-five feet away were utterly demol-
ished it seems incredible yet no one not
even the engine crew was hurt

what one engine did

  this is doing pretty well but after all
the palm really belongs to a rock island
switch-engine this switch-engine which
was old enough to have outgrown the reck-
lessness of youth but belonged to the age
when they made throttle-valves that would
not always stay put was standing sedately
enough on a side-track at council bluffs
iowa on january   with no one
on board

  presently a wabash passenger-train came
along it was attending strictly to its own
business but the switch engine took ex-
ception to it the yarders throttle flew
open and it dashed through a split switch
butted a coach off the wabash train and
sent it sprawling into the ditch the
shock derailed the switcher but it scram-
bled along on the ties until it ran into a
union pacific switch-engine and knocked
it also into the ditch

  this second shock deflected the rock
island engine far enough for it to reach
over and yank the engine off an incoming
whims of the wheels



 passenger-train of its own line and hurl it
 into the ditch then it stopped with its nose
 in the dirt and its cab tilted at a rakish
 angle to gloat over the ruin it had wrought
 in all this weird mix-up no one was seri-
 ously injured

the trials of a trespasser

   still any one who fools around a rail-
 road must take his chances of getting hurt
 there was a north caro-
 linian who took the broad
 and easy path afforded by
 the railroad on his way to
 a turkey - blind with his
 trust double-barreled shot-
 gun containing a heavy
 charge of buckshot in each
 barrel as related by gen-
 eral manager l e john-
 son of the norfolk and
 western the turkey-hunter
 presently met a fast train
 and with true southern
 chivalry stepped aside and
 gave it the whole road

   a little scrub-bull which
 had also wandered onto the
 track was less polite how-
 ever instead of getting
 out of the way the bull
 drew a mark in the ballast
 with one forefoot threw
 some dirt on his back and then with low-
 ered head dared the train to cross the
 mark well it crossed the mark all right
 at fifty miles an hour and the bull-oh
 where was he

   probably no one could answer that ques-
 tion in full but it is known that for a very
 brief fraction of a second the bull and the
 turkey-hunter both tried to occupy the same
 spot at the same time which as every
 one knows is impossible the result was
 that the turkey-hunter was knocked into
 a pond which broke his fall and un-
 doubtedly saved his life he was severe-
 ly hurt his shotgun was knocked out of
 his hands and in falling was discharged
 and two cows that had the misfortune to
 be in range of the buckshot were killed

  when he recovered the turkey-hunter
 as was natural sued the railroad company
 for illegally unlawfully and against the
 peace of the sovereign state of north
 carolina throwing one bull at him by
 which aforesaid illegal and unlawful act

 he suffered grievous bodily harm at the
 same time which probably was also nat-
 ural the owner pf the cows sued the tur-
 key-hunter for shooting them

  after two notable trials the unfeeling
court held that the railroad company owed
the turkey-hunter nothing for hitting him
with a bull but that he owed the farmer
one hundred dollars for killing his cows
when such things as this can happen is it
any wonder that railroads are unpopular

the passengers were suddenly aroused by
a series of blood-curdling shrieks

  no he who wants justice from a rail-
road will get quicker action if he takes
matters into his own hands there was
a kentuckian whose cow was killed by a
louisville and nashville train a dozen
years ago when the engine that killed
the cow came through on its next trip the
owner of the cow was at the station wait-
ing for it stepping up to the engineer
he demanded pay for the cow

  oh thats all right airily replied


the railroad mans magazine

the engineer  the company will pay as
soon as it gets around to it

   look-a-hyar stranger replied the
kentuckian  ah do know the company
but ah know you-all killed my cow and
if you-all doan pay fo her allll fill you
so full of holes they kin use yer carcass
for a colander do you heah me

  the cow was paid for on the spot

  another man who was too shrewd to
trust his cause to the blind goddess was
a passenger in a pullman car which left
the rails near a bridge on the norfolk and
western a few years ago and plunged
down the bank into a river that was swollen
by a freshet the doors being closed the
windows being double and the trucks hav-
ing dropped off the car filled slowly as it
floated down the river

  it was very early before the passengers
were up the men inside broke open the
ventilators and with the aid of outside
help all hands were rescued there were
two women passengers who tumbled out of
their berths clad only in their night-robes
and with their hair done up in curl-papers

  they had to hang on to the curtain-
pole with the water up to their arms and
it certainly looked as if they were going
to drown with the rest of the passengers
yet general manager johnson declares
upon his honor that when they were res-
cued their hair was neatly done up how
they managed it sloshing around in the
water nearly to their chins with death
staring them in the face only a woman
can understand

his modest claim

  among the passengers was one man
who alone in all that carful did not put in
a claim for enormous damages for lost
baggage on the contrary he was very
active and very helpful to the company in
resisting unreasonable and unjust demands
naturally the company felt very grateful

  one day the considerate man was asked
what he had lost very modestly he con-
fessed that he had lost a satchel contain-
ing a quantity of costly clothing inclu-
ding some fine silk underwear but he made
whims of the wheels



no claim for this the company was try-
ing hard to get along and he believed in
doing to others as he would that others
should do to him

  besides that he was only too glad to get
out alive still he also
had in that satchel a
watch and some jewelry
mere trinkets worth al-	y

together  rather	

than have any trouble
about it he would allow
the company to pay him
for the watch and jew-
elry that is if it really
insisted what could the
company do but shell
out  as quickly as
the money could be
counted 

  in due time the car
was fished out of the
river and in it the lost
satchel of the consider-
ate one was found here
is an inventory of its
contents one cotton
shirt one pair cotton
socks two collars one
pair cuffs half-pint
whisky

  however it is not al-
ways the cunning pas-
senger w h o triumphs
over the grasping corpo-
ration but on the con-
trary it is the passenger who sometimes gets
the worst of it when the erie was newer
than it is now conductor james tinney in
going out of jersey city came to a passen-
ger a woman with a baby who refused to
pay her fare

infant indemnity

  she gave no reasons she did not argue
she simply declined to pay for riding to
paterson did conductor tinney get
nasty and act rude to a lady not he
rule no  of the rules and regulations
of the new york and erie railroad in
effect march   read rudeness or
incivility to passengers will in all cases
meet with immediate punishment con-
ductor tinney was not hunting for pun-
ishment at the same time railroads in
those eatly days had a rule in effect like
no  of the rules and regulations of the

concord and clermont r r in effect
january   which read as follows
if fares are refused to be paid or
checks delivered they the conductors
will secure themselves if practicable by

started toward the
baggage-car with a
businesslike air

the detention of baggage or by removing
the person from the cars

  as the lady had no baggage conductor
tinney could not secure himself all he
could do was to bow courteously and pass
on he even went further than that
when the lady alighted at paterson it
was conductor tinney who was on hand
to help her down he even went so far as
to take the baby while she stepped to the
platform when she held out her arms
for her darling conductor tinney smiling
sweetly said

  now madame when you pay your
fare you can have the baby

   i wont pay you a cent

  very well then ill keep the baby


the railroad mans magazine

its a mighty fine boy and dirt cheap at
the price

  with that he tucked the baby under one
arm and started toward the baggage-car
with a businesslike air the lady fol-
lowed at first in a rage then in tears
then she opened a well-filled pocketbook
showing that she had not refused to pay
for her ride from lack of means handed
over the exact change and received her
baby and a bow that beau brummel never
equaled in his good-for-nothing life

a celestial strategist

  not all railroad employees are the equal
of conductor tinney unfortunately for
the railroads in  silver was at a
discount in california that is to say no
one would accept more than ten dollars of
it in one payment one day a chinaman
walked into the southern pacific ticket of-
fice at san francisco and asked for three
tickets to stockton on being told that
the price was ten dollars and a half he
counted out the sum in silver

   youll have to give me gold for these
said the agent icily holding on to the
pasteboards

  ah you too muchee smartee you no
catchee gold allee time retorted the
chinaman shoving the silver over

   come now fork over the gold you
know the rule

  the chinaman scooped the coins back
into his pocket then with a cold glitter
in his almond eyes he snapped

  how muchee one ticket stockton
  three dollars and a half

  you takee silver one ticket

  yes

   gimme one ticket stockton

the silver was counted out and the
ticket was tucked into an inside pocket

  again the chinaman demanded  gim-
me one ticket stockton

  after the second transaction had been
brought to a successful conclusion and the
silver transferred to the railroad till the
celestial traveler for a third time laid
down three dollars and a half in silver
coin and said

   gimme one ticket stockton

  picking up the third ticket his face ex-
panded into a heathen leer as he said to
the discomfited agent

  you too muchee smartee

but speaking of railroad rules and the

fidelity with which they are observed the
prize incident occurred on the watford-
rickmansworth branch of the london and
northwestern in  on this branch
five miles long there was only one train
but it was operated on the staff system in
which the only rights recognized are con-
ferred by the possession of a steel wand

  one day the solitary train was made up
at watford and the passengers were shut
in ready to depart for the junction when it
was discovered that the staff was missing
it had been forgotten and left at rickmans-
worth on the up trip

  now the rules explicitly provided that
the branch must be operated by the staff
system there was not a word about run-
ning trains on time-card rights or on train
orders clearly there was nothing to do
but send a guard on foot to rickmans-
worth five miles awav for the missing
staff in order to release the train there-
fore it was done and the train finally
proceeded strictly according to regulations
but two and a half hours late of course
the passengers missed their connections
but what did that signify

  that was wonderful presence of mind
for an english railroad man but not
quite up to the exploit of dennis cassin
an engineer on the new york central who
was coining south through sing sing with
a freight-train in may  cassin was
following as close as the rules allowed be-
hind a passenger-train

he gave her the water cure

  as he was running slow and had three
gages of water he shut off the pumps en-
tirely for in those days they stuck to the
good old pump he had barely done so
when five convicts dropped from a bridge
down on the tank and rushing into the
cab with cocked revolvers they ordered cas-
sia and his fireman off

  it was a bold attempt at escape which
would have succeeded but for cassin he
knew better than to attempt resistance and
he also knew something about locomotives
as he climbed off his seat-box he reached
down and turned the little lever beside
the boiler-head opening the pump-valves
wide

  his act was not understood by the con-
victs who instantly opened the throttle
and shot down the track after the pas-
senger-train the prospects for a terrible
whims of the wheels



wreck seemed bright with those reckless
desperadoes in the cab it undoubtedly
would have occurred if it had not been for
cassin

  with both pumps wide open the boiler
was flooded the water began going through
the throttle-valve and the locomotive came
to a stop with both cylinder-heads knocked
out before it had gone three miles it was
therefore unnecessary to turn it into the

          i 

rushing into the cab with
cocked revolvers they
ordered cassin and
his fireman off

river at a switch as had been ordered when
cassin gave the alarm

  if that incident had occurred a quarter
of a century later cassin would have re-

               being praised and petted
               for doing their duty

                 there was the case of
              major rogers the capable
              but eccentric american
              engineer who did such ef-
              fective work in surveying
              the canadian pacific it
              was major rogers who
              found a practicable route
              across the selkirks the
              pass was named in his

--z honor

                 altogether the major
rendered such valuable
services that the pleased
and grateful company
voted him a bonus of five
thousand dollars to die unutterable dis-
tress of the auditor months rolled by and
the check was not presented for payment
at last major rogers paid a visit to head-

ceived ten credit marks and a letter from
the superintendent and perhaps even a
gold watch or something but in the good
old days railroad men were not used to


the railroad mans magazine

r

quarters and general manager van horne
took occasion to ask why the check had not
been cashed

his only testimonial

   good heavens sir that is the only
testimonial i have i have had it framed
and glazed and it hangs over my bed i
shall never part with it

  van horne changed the subject next
day he bought a fine gold watch had a
suitable inscription to the effect that it
was presented to major rogers by the c

p r and so forth the watch was kept
in the general managers desk awaiting
major rogerss next visit

  on that occasion van horne took out
the watch showed it to the engineer with-
out letting go of it and read him the in-
scription then he returned the watch to
the drawer which he ostentatiously locked
the majors smile of delight faded into
an open-eyed look of dismay

  why-why dont i get the watch
he asked

   certainly you get it whenever you
present that check and draw your money

booming the town

a commercial traveler who was going
through a certain state for the first time
alighted at a way-station which was named for a
politician of national renown he looked about
for the town but there were only a few forlorn
houses then he looked about for the station
there was only an old freight-car-a small old-
style car of  pounds capacity rigged up
with steps leading to its wide-open middle door
the traveler climbed up and peered inside a
pine table held a languidly-ticking telegraph in-
strument and in a far corner the station-master
leaned back in his chair his feet on the telegraph-
table there was no one else-in sight

   wheres your town   asked the traveler

  the station-master pointed with his thumb
toward the few houses outside

   what  the traveler exclaimed  is that all
the town youve got and named for so-and-so
too well wheres your station

  the station-master waved his hand toward the
interior of the car

   what  the traveler exclaimed again  is
this all the station youve got

  at that the station-master removed his feet
from the telegraph-table brought the front of his
chair down to the floor and eyed the stranger
sternly

  now look here he said  thats all the town
weve got and this heres all the station weve
got and we are named for so-and-so  but you
just bear this in mind stranger theres a boom
on in this town  thats what 

  the commercial travelers hopes began to rise
 oh is that so  he asked

   yes thats so  the other replied  why
even the railroad is onto it theyre going to
give us a new station  

  the travelers interest increased you dont
say  he said

   thats what theyare  the station-master
proudly declared  theyre going to give us a
new freight-car f  pounds capacity

courtesy is capital stock

did you ever try to figure out the money-
value of courtesy has it ever occurred to
you that courtesy in business may be set down in
dollars and cents that courtesy makes money
and that discourtesy loses it

  let us consider courtesy briefly as an asset as
part of the capital stock of the company for which
you work of course the question has its higher
its ethical side and we have dwelt upon this fre-
quently in this magazine but here and now let
us make a practical application and see what
courtesy means as a business asset

  take an illustration a man wishes to travel
from one city to another the fare is ten dollars
he may take his choice of two or more rail-
roads for the journey he drops into the ticket-
office of one road he finds a grouchy tactless

impatient discourteous clerk behind the counter
owing to the manner of his reception he deter-
mines to travel over another road in the second
office he is greeted cordially is treated politely
is made to feel that his business is desired that
the clerk as a representative of his company is
glad to see him glad to sell him a ticket glad to
do all in his power to make the journey a pleasant
one

  is it not clear that in the first instance dis-
courtesy lost one company ten dollars and that in
the second instance courtesy gained ten dollars
for another company the ten dollars gained
goes to pay dividends and interest and wages and
running expenses courtesy in this case had a
distinct money-value it could be set down on
paper in dollars and cents-the northwestern
 not on the flimsy

 by frank condon

             a discarded item which failed to show why
             walt watson lost his courage and vanished

alf a dozen editors skimmed
 over the sheet of a p flimsy
 sneered inwardly and with
 the brief tightening of the
 lips that indicates editorial
 disgust whisked the offend-
 ing sheet into the capacious jaws of the
 waste-paper basket

 nobody hurt nobody killed nothing
smashed and nothing happened  they said
indignantly and those idiots put such
trash on the wire for a real newspaper

  the cause

                           albion march 

    itinerant telegraph operator working extra
  failed hand over train-order but retrieved
  negligence and prevented collision between two
  passenger-trains by trick of daring and
  strength early to-day before he disappeared

    train no  west-bound and late pulled
  out of southwestern railway station without
  the operator having delivered order to hold
  it for passing of east-bound train operator
  rushed along track missed steps of last car
  and fell headlong

    jumped up and running caught rear pulled
  himself onto vestibule-door smashed glass and
  stopped train

    just enough time get back to albion when
  east-bound train rushed by operator has
  not been seen since

 valuable space in modern newspapers
cannot be given over to such piffle if the
operator had missed the rear car if the

west-bound had plunged into the east-
bound if there had been a list of dead a
column long as a broom handle then
sneered the editors-then it would be worth
the attention of the linotype men

  at the moment the insulting news item
was being worded a man was sitting in the
rear of a barroom thirty miles from albion
with white linen bandages around his
bruised hands and a glass of fiery liquid be-
fore him-a rather grimy young man with
the face of a very old man and the shaking
fingers of one who has burned his fires too
rapidly

  this was walt watson and he was the
operator who had fled from albion if a
confession could have been worried from him
perhaps the  story  would have escaped the
paper-basket

  two comrades drifted into buffalo during
the pan-american exposition they drift-
ed out after the show had ended and the
walls were coming down and simultaneously
they entered the service of the southwestern
railway one of them was called stock-
bridge and the other was walt watson

  for a year they raced for advancement

  stockbridge was a marvelously good op-
erator and in the course of time he began
to attract attention from headquarters he
was as good an operator as walt watson

  stockbridge moved up a peg watson re-
mained where he was stockbridge knew
why


the railroad mans magazine

    walt he said one night  weve got to
separate you and i have been living to-
gether since we left school and i believe
were pretty fond of each other so youll
forgive me if i say anything that hurts youx
ive been promoted one notch youd
have come right along with me if it hadnt
been for one thing you know what that
is youre just a little bit too fond of the
stuff that has killed off better men than you
and me and the company knows it im
sorry walt but theres nothing i can do
its a fight that each man has to fight him-
self-and his friend cant help him

   i know all that stocky never mind
the preachments whats the immediate
cause of this w c t u meeting walt
asked sullenly

  just this stockbridge replied the
southwestern says ive got to give you up
ive got to pack up my belongings and live
elsewhere in other words were not to
travel together from now on

   for your advancement sneered wat-
son  go ahead then there are no
strings whatever attached to you perhaps
ill relish the change

  stockbridge made no answer he silently
got his things together and walked out

    so-long walt he said pausing in the
door  if youll take a friends advice
youll cut out that stuff

   it is a good thing watson said lightly
- a good tiling for every man to mind his
own business its really profitable

  that was the last watson saw of stock-
bridge for many months he heard of him
frequently and little by little there grew up
within him a feeling of resentment that
gradually turned to dislike bitter and abi-
ding dislike gave way to hatred finally

  there was a girl watson and stock-
bridge met her in buffalo and liked her from
the beginning they had bantered each oth-
er good-humoredly at first

   i think i saw her first stockbridge
laughed you are hereby invited to attend
the wedding walt and if youre good you
may wear a waiters outfit and be our best
man grace would look amazing good as
mrs joseph stockbridge

    your wires are crossed in nine places
watson had answered  grace and i will
be doing that little parade down the main
aisle and you can stand in the vestibule and
hold the flowers

  walton was almost right-almost grace
was fond of both men but there was a pres-

sure to her handshake with walt watson
that stockbridge had neverfelt little by
little walton forged ahead he had kissed
the girl months before stockbridge had ever
suspected and when the little love-affair was
at its most prominent stage the smash came

  the cause was the same that had brought
the frown of the southwestern upon its
young operator walt called half a dozen
times on his sweetheart showing the effect
of liquor

  the girl was shocked and disgusted

  from that time on he played a losing
game he was supplanted in graces favor
stockbridge passed him in love as he had
passed him in business

  hes a cur watson fumed  ill get
him for that

  watson became lax in his work and even-
tually the southwestern dismissed him he
secured new positions-and lost them from
a clean-cut young chap he changed into a
shiftless ill-clad loafer and became untrust-
worthy

  where he was known he could get no
work by changing his name and traveling
he picked up a precarious living and secured
the funds to buy his cld enemy

  stockbridge forged ahead during the years
that followed he married three years after
he separated from his- comrade and the
brides name was grace watson heard of
the wedding and cursed them time in-
stead of cooling his enmity for his former
chum bolstered and increased it and alco-
hol did the rest

  in many a frenzy he promised stockbridge
a speedy end if the two ever met

  then watson drifted eastward by slow
stages by changing his name repeatedly
he landed in brief-held positions lnknow-
ing the southwestern itself paid a frequent
wage to the operator who jumped from place
to place and watson smiled grimly when-
ever he noticed orders from the chief train-
despatchers office

  they were always signed  stockbridge

   hes up and im down watson reflect-
ed bitterly he cheated me and ill get
him for it

  he thought of a number of events that
had occurred in the years between their
friendship and the present he remembered
the days when he had applied for work on a
dozen railroads and of the mysterious in-
formation that had always filtered in be-
fore he secured the job he had no ref-
erences and reports about him invariably
not on the flimsy



resulted in disaster once he had seen a
telegram lying on an office desk it read

     sorry operator watson unreliable bad
  record drinks

                  stockbridge southwestern

  far out in wisconsin watson had been
discharged without cause a prying and
envious coworker had interested in his past
the company employing watson stock-
bridge had again been forced to tell the truth
there were other matters too

  not only is he up watson often mut-
tered  but hes not satisfied to let me alone
hes kicked me farther down every time he
has had the chance

  by constantly nursing his animosity for
stockbridge and indulging in virulent out-
bursts of rage watson kept his blood hot
and the friendly feeling of the other south-
western men for the chief train-despatcher
only aggravated his resentment

  he landed in albion penniless and hun-
gry and the friendly offices of the night op-
erator secured him a temporary berth at the
key

  a husky storm was tuning up for the night
when the regular operator put on his coat
watson was huddled before the meager fire

   better watch the line pretty close to-
night said the former  there is a num-
ber of blocks and stockbridge is coming
down on no  with miles

  watson sat up with a start
  stockbridge he asked

   the chief replied the other  hes
been doing this inspection stunt regular of
late

   great watson sneered  i suppose he
rides on velvet cushions in a pullman private
car

   youre wrong said the regular man re-
sentfully  hes no snob he rides with
miles in the cab when he comes out on no
 hes a mighty decent fellow too
watson walked about the diminutive room
when his companion had gone looking over
the tawdry fixtures and listening to the
clicking of the key he had borrowed a
small advance from the operator its result
was a brown flask that protruded from his
hip-pocket and that made frequent stimu-
lating trips to his mouth

  stockbridge is coming on  he
laughed bitterly hed be surprised if he
could look in here when she goes by and see
his old friend at the key-the man he pushed
down and out

   watson found a heavy wrench he stared
at it a long time and ran his fingers over the
heavy steel knobs

    id like to use this on him he growled

   ck - ck - ck - ck - ck-
chattered the instrument

   watson sank into his chair and replied

   his fingers had long failed before the
regular keys of a typewriter and it was with
difficulty that he could use them at all ta-
king a rapid message on the machine was
beyond him so he toiled laboriously with pen
and ink

   suddenly he looked up from his work and
stared at the pile of slips on the table the
key clattered and clicked impatiently but
watson did not heed

   he read the message over again

   hold no  east-bound at albion till no

     passes

   he looked out into the night the sleet
had changed to a thick feathery snow he
glanced at the clock and noted that it was
fifteen minutes of nine

   no  was due in albion at nine oclock

  during the next ten minutes watson
paced back and forth the grudge of a half-
score years was working in his heated veins
and he was pondering wildly on the revenge

   in the cab of no  stockbridge was be-
ing hurled westward no  carried five
coaches and paused for nothing

   east of albion lay the worst curve on the
southwestern system-a long waving  s 
bend that shut out the track ahead

    theyd never know  the operator mut-
tered hoarsely  he deserves it he spiked
me he ruined my life and kicked me down
farther than i was hes a cur and he de-
serves it 

   watsons face had grown deathly white

   revenge was distorting his view and the
fire of his steady hatred was being rapidly
fanned into blind unreasoning fury and a
wild craving for revenge

   consequences mattered not at all he saw
stockbridge in the west-bound cab he saw
the east-bound approach he heard the
grinding of steel and wood the roaring of
the released steam and the passing of the
man who had ruined him

   hell get it-hell get it to-night he
whispered

  the minute-hand was dragging upward
toward nine watson stood in the door fa-
cing the inrush of snow and peering toward
the west


the railroad mans magazine

  the faint moan of the east-bound struck
him a shiver ran down his body the
pin-point of yellow light appeared grow-
ing larger each moment in another instant
no  drew into albion and slowed down

  watson waved the  no order  salute from
wherehe stood his blood boomed through
him and his head began to whirl a pas-
senger alighted and hurried away

  watson turned and faced the east

  somewhere around the long turn no 
was gliding along through the feathery snow-
storm

  the end was only a matter of moments

  the operator stepped back into his room
and pulled on his coat the order slipped
from his hand and fell to the floor where
it lay shining in a ray of light from the
feeble lamp outside the bell-cord hissed
its command with a shriek of steam and
the jangle of the bell no  glided slowly
forward for she had stopped on a slight
grade

  the feeling about watsons throat tight-
ened his eyes were glaring and his hands
were shaking so that he could scarcely lift
his ragged cap to his head

   ive done it  he shouted

  his voice was half a groan and half the
outburst of a maniac then he started to
the door the tail-lights of no  were
slowly swinging past him he turned for a
last look into the dingy office and as he did
so the glint of the fateful order lying in

the glow of the lamp struck him between
the eyes

  a sudden revulsion ran through him and
in another instant he was chattering with the
deadly fear of one condemned

  his body grew cold succeeding the wild
throbbing heat of the preceding minutes

  with a sudden snap his tottering senses
slipped back into place and his disordered
mind resumed the normal he forgot every-
thing in the world except that train no 
was passing out of albion and that train
no  was rushing toward it

  with a half-articulate yell he turned and
started down the track in the wake of the
rumbling train thats all

  very clearly and succinctly the little
newspaper despatch tells the rest

  watson stumbled ahead fell several times
caught the rear of no  and stopped the
train

  he tumbled off into the snow and faded
away like a wraith no  shot by and into
the west-and the incident was ended

  the next morning stockbridge was ac-
quainted with the details the regular op-
erator at albion was dismissed before noon

  who was the operator at the key
stockbridge inquired of his assistant

   dunno that gentleman responded
 somebody but i dont know who said it
sounded like clifford

   clifford the chief repeated- clif-
ford never heard of the man

h ow the free riders sleep

by j h craige

when one thinks of the traveling hobo clinging by the  skin of his teeth 
to the trucks the roof or the brake-beams of an express train going
at the rate of sixty miles an hour and enjoying at the same time a
repose akin to that which he might find  a feather bed the idea-well it
just doesnt seem to jibe does it to entice morpheus under such conditions
seems about equal to playing a parley with sudden death suicide and fool-
hardiness written on the card

    from cape cod to the golden gate the hobo journeys by night and sleeps
where most men would fear to travel in the light with their eyes wide open on
the top of a car clutching the grimy ventilator tubes with the grip of a vise
curled up in the vestibule of the blind baggage or wedged above the whirling
axles of the trucks-it is all the same to him

     the astonishing part of it all is that he usually comes through alive

the peculiar instinct that permits a rider of the beam to sleep soundly
and in safety when it would mean instant death
to lose his grip for a moment

ight is the hobos traveling
time he insists on riding
a fast express securing a
time-table of the road on
which he wishes to travel he
picks out the fastest night-
train lies in hiding until she is ready to
pull out of the station where he is waiting
and swings aboard her rear end thus
dodging the railroad bulls who always
hang about the front end of a train watch-
ing the blind-baggage where the inexperi-
enced tramps try to ride

  once aboard he is safe until the next
stop which in the case of an express-train
seldom takes place in less than an hour or
two even when a stop is made perched
on the roof or on the trucks of the rear
car the hobo is far from the lights of the
station where the forward cars stop and
is practically sure of an undisturbed ride
as long as the darkness lasts during the

eight or ten hours from dusk to dawn a
good traveler can easily put from three to
four hundred miles behind him

  unsoftened by springs and cushions the
steady thud thud of a moving train has
a most decided soporific effect on the hu-
man frame add to this the effect of the
darkness and the fact that the tramp on
the road seldom gets any repose in the day-
time and you have a combination of cir-
cumstances which makes sleep during the
journey almost inevitable

  it is only to be expected that death will
claim a heavy toll among these free riders
each year records from five to ten per cent
of their total number killed or injured but
the survivors go on taking chances

  one philosophic hobo whose partner i
saw killed near eugene oregon last sum-
mer expressed the tramps view of the
matter very well this was his comment
over the mangled remains


the railroad mans magazine

  poor old bills gone well miss him
but it wont make any difference to the
world theres plenty more where he
came from next

  strangely enough he was next i
heard a few days later that he had been
ground to pieces under a portland yard-
engine an ignominious end for a veteran
blown - in - the - glass bo who had traveled
over the road since his boyhood

  there are plenty more where he came
from railroad reports show that in the
neighborhood of ten thousand tramps are
killed or maimed every year of these
perhaps fifty per cent are good people
the title which the more expert professional
tramps apply to themselves

  the other fifty per cent is made up of
gay cats or occasional tramps men who
will work hard and regularly for a time
but who are periodically forced to take to
the road either because of labor conditions
or through the call of wanderlust

 gay cats  only amateurs

  compared to the real tramp the  gay
cat is a poor traveler the drudgery of
habitual manual labor has either stiffened
his muscles or life indoors has dulled the
keenness of his animal senses and left him
more a product of civilization and less a
primitive savage than his brother the full-
fledged tramp

  he is slow of hand foot and brain his
perceptions are faulty in the parlance of
the prize-ring his judgment of distance
is on the blink he is poorly fitted for
survival in the hostile and pitiless en-
vironment of life on the road and accident
overtakes him at every turn

  when he makes a flying dive for the
hand - rail of a moving train he often
misses it and is thrown under the wheels
his faulty instincts make him try to oc-
cupy most insecure positions from which
he is jolted by the motion of the train
frequently deserted by that guardian
spirit that seems to guide the feet of the
wayfarer he steps from behind a train
and meets his fate in the path of the ex-
press that is rushing down the next track

  the professional tramp who is a good
traveler is a very different individual al-
though sgldom a powerful man he is as
lithe alert and active as a panther a
perfect type of the primitive cat-animal
since the passing of the indian tracker

there has been no type of man whose ani-
mal instincts and senses have been so per-
fectly developed his judgment is seldom
faulty his hand never falters and his foot
never slips

death claims many -iims

  despite his greater fitness to survive
however as many  good people  are killed
and maimed on the road every year as
gay cats and because of the smaller
number of regulars the percentage of cas-
ualties among them is thus far greater than
it is among the cats thereason for
this is that under ordinary conditions the
cat travels by day on freight-trains
where there is little temptation to sleep and
little danger to him if he does while the
regular adopting the habits of the feline
whose traits he possesses travels by night
and sleeps in the daytime

   the expert bo disapproves of local trains
and he has little use for freights except
for an occasional nap in an empty box car
if he happens to find one going in his di-
rection

  perhaps a natural conclusion would be
that the first time a hobo succumbed to
sleep in such places as he generally travels
there would be another gap in the ranks of
the tramp army but here the subconscious
mind that most discussed and least under-
stood of psychic phenomena comes into
the case

feats of the subconscious mind

  according to the best authorities both
medical and psychological the subconscious
mind lives at the back of the brain just
over its near relatives the mind centers
which govern the beating of the heart
breathing and other involuntary- functions
of the body

  in the subconscious mind habits are
formed it is by careful education of the
subconscious mind that the boxer acquires
the ability to perceive an opening and to
strike simultaneously if he were com-
pelled to stop and think before hitting his
opportunity would be lost but he has
formed the habit and the eye perceives and
the hand strikes without conscious mental
action on his part

  the subconscious mind forms the con-
necting link between the conscious reason-
ing mind and the brain centers which gov-
how the free riders sleep



ern involuntary action the lower forms
of life have only the ganglia governing the
involuntary processes in addition to this
the higher animals have also the power of
forming habits necessary to their preser-
vation

  man adds to these the ability to reason
and plan but in the case of civilized man
the power of reason has so far removed
him from the exigencies of animal exist-
ence that he has lost through disuse the
subconscious alertness so prominent in the
make-up of the savage and the wild beast

  by careful education and constant ex-
ertion of the will the civilized man can ac-
quire to a certain extent the subconscious
alertness enjoyed by his savage ancestors
it is by education of his subconscious mind
that the hobo acquires the facility of sleep-
ing in an insecure perch on a moving train
without suffering invariable and instant an-
nihilation he does not acquire this fac-
ulty through design or by choice but by
necessity and with fear and trembling as
most other faculties necessary to existence
are acquired

  keeping a grip while sound asleep

  when a tramp begins to ride trains at
night his constant fear is that he will fall
-asleep stretched out on the roof or
crouched on the trucks he sits shivering
flexing his muscles shaking his body as
much as his situation will permit pinching
himself and resorting to every possible ex-
pedient to keep awake in deadly terror lest
sleep relax his grip and he fall to a speedy
and horrible death

  perhaps during his first few night-jour-
neys this terror is so intense that it over-
comes his fatigue and he stays awake or
he sleeps so lightly that he does not know
that he has slept

  during these journes the hours of in-
tense fear make a tremendous impression
upon his subconscious mind later he
happens to travel with an old-timer and
sees the careless abandon with which the
veteran allows himself to sink into slumber
also he observes that nothing happens to
his comrade and his terror lest sleep over-
take him is considerably abated still the
fear education continues although in a more
moderate form

  gradually his fears fade away and he
allows himself with less and less misgiv-
ings to doze and nod on his nightly rides

until at last he reaches the stage where he
stretches himself out for a nap every time
he has a chance to make himself tolerably
comfortable on a moving train with all the
carelessness of the veteran whose slumber
aroused his admiration in earlier days

change of speed dangerous

  then the education of his subconscious
mind is complete and he is able to hold
down anything that turns a wheel asleep or
awake with a certain amount of security
there are two psychological moments how-
ever during which it seems to be impos-
sible for the average man to educate his
subconsciousness to remain on guard

  one of these is when the train on which
the tramp is traveling changes its pace or
motion while the other is when the sleeper
awakes though we can educate the sub-
conscious mind to perform almost any regu-
lar series of simple movements or adapt
itself to almost any conditions without the
guidance of the conscious mind as soon as
the regularity is broken or the conditions
change the operations of the subconscious
mind cease

  it is a peculiar fact that if a tramp falls
asleep on a train traveling at a rate of
thirty miles an hour a change in speed to
sixty or to fifteen miles an hour will often
place him in serious danger either the
shock to his mental processes will be suffi-
cient to arouse him or he will sink into
deeper slumber in which nothing is more
probable than that some serious accident
will befall him

  one of the most shocking accidents of
this kind that i have ever witnessed oc-
curred last summer near battle mountain
nevada it was just before dawn and a
great many tramps were riding the train
making their way toward reno to the jef-
fries-johnson pugilistic battle which was
scheduled to take place in a few days i
myself was riding a rear truck and many
other tramps were strung along the whole
length of the train

he lost his hold

  the trucks on the union and southern
pacific pullmans were not designed to ac-
commodate a tall man with comfort i was
far from sleep and was having a most mis-
erable time as i turned over for about
the nineteenth time to get some of the


the railroad mans magazine

cramps out of my body while i blessed the
trainmen who had made it necessary for us
to ride the trucks the emergency brakes
suddenly screamed on and our speed which
had been previously about thirty miles an
hour was cut down to almost a walk a
few seconds later the brakes were released
and the train proceeded at its former speed

  a short distance out of the town we struck
a curve which jolted every one sharply to
the left instantly a series of ear-piercing
screams rose from under the car ahead
then they stopped and a red trail appeared
on the ties below

  when we stopped some one inside the
train who had heard the cries caused a
search to be instituted and a bundle of
red rags was found tightly wrapped around
one of the cars axles all that was left of
a tramp who had been riding on the truck
a blue-lipped blood-spattered man who had
been riding the same truck was discovered
near-by too weak from fright and horror to
crawl out from under the train

a high dive

  according to his story the two had been
traveling together and were both asleep on
the truck when he had been awakened by
the jar of the emergency brakes he was
composing himself for another nap when
he noticed that his partner was reeling dan-
gerously in his seat

  he was about to reach out to awaken him
when the train struck the curve and top-
pling back the sleeping man allowed his
coat to become wrapped about the revolving
axle

  despite his struggles and screams he was
unable to free himself and was slowly
drawn into the whirlin mill i heard
later in san francisco that the survivor had
gone mad

  when a man is very alert or the change
of pace or motion of the train he is riding
is very pronounced he usually awakes in
doing so he runs scarcely less risk than the
man who sleeps on for the moment when
the alert subconscious sentinel is dismissed
and the drowsy sentinel of awakening con-
sciousness takes charge is one of great
danger

  a mans first impulse when aroused from
sleep is to stretch and yawn and there are
times when these may bring the most dire
results some time ago at north platte
nebraska a sudden awakening involved me

in a farce-comedy that might very easily
have been a tragedy

  the train on the roof of which i was
traveling stopped suddenly and with quite
a jolt the first thing i can recall is
awakening with a gulp from that terrible
race-old falling dream and reaching out
frantically for something to stop my de-
scent then i lurched off the train and
began to fall in sure enough earnest

  luckily i lit on a truck piled with mail-
sacks awaiting an east-bound train and
was not hurt in the least however i came
within an ace of falling on one of north
plattes leading citizens that gentleman
let out a bawl that would have done
credit to one of his own steers and before
i had made up my mind as to whether i
was still dreaming or had really had a fall
one of the town constables appeared on the
scene and escorted me to the village lockup
the next day as my prosecutor did not ap-
pear the same rural constable who had
arrested me escorted me back to the rail-
road and invited me to beat it

  another of the chief causes of disaster to
tramps is liquor night riding is almost
always cold and often the tramp has no
more nerve than he needs and resorts to
dutch courage every railroader sees so
many near-accidents to drunken tramps
that he is apt to wonder that there are not
more casualties than really take place

  almost all tramps who have the subcon-
scious faculties of the mind highly de-
veloped are men of strong will and indi-
viduality whose mind and purpose are so
strong that it would seem that they rule
their actions even when asleep by sheer
force of character however i have seen
some startling exceptions to this rule

strange case of denver joe

  perhaps the strangest case that ever came
under my notice was that of denver joe a
child of the road whom i met in winne-
mucca nevada

  like many road monikers his title was
misleading he was not from denver at
all but from los angeles his age was
indeterminate he looked sixteen but was
probably much older

  it was only a few days before the his-
toric pugilistic battle at reno a hundred
miles or more to the west and the boes were
flocking over the road in such number that
the distracted railroad authorities in an en-
how the free riders sleep



deavor to stem the tide were stationing
 sapping parties  of husky railroad
 bulls  and deputy  bulls  at every divi-
sion station armed with clubs arid with
instructions to give it to the tramps good
and plenty after which they were to jail
the remains

  numerous tramps were hanging about the
town waiting to catch the first mail-train
out which ran through at about eight
oclock in the evening i had seen several
of these constables lurking about the sta-
tion with large business-like clubs so i had
about decided that i did not want to catch
that early mail

  there were a dozen fight specials coming
through that night anyway and i knew that
the bulls would become sleepy before i
would i tried to warn some of the tramps
whom i knew but got a laugh for my
trouble so hunting up an unused feed-bin
on the side of the station overlooking the
track i worked loose a board and climbed
in to await events

  i had scarcely arranged things to my
liking when the board was pushed back
again and denver joe wiggled in bringing
with him numerous hand-outs that he had
collected from the winnemucca back doors

  all he said was help yourself to
whatever you want partner and wake me
up when you go then he lay down and
was asleep in an instant as he told it after-
ward he had been traveling steadily for
two nights and a day and had been kept so
busily on the move by the winnemucca
bulls that he had gotten very little sleep
in the last forty-eight hours

on the observation-car

  while i was helping myself to such of
the hand-outs as i fancied the eight
oclock train came through and i saw with
a good deal of very heathenish delight i
must admit several of the gentlemen who
had scoffed at my advice get a thorough
taste of the sap-sticks

  when the tumult and the shouting -died
i took a nap and awoke somewhere near
midnight as closely as i could tell by the
stars it was cold and the station was de-
serted a train was approaching when it
stopped the last car was about even with
my feed-box

  wake up partner i called and
reachcd over to shake my young friend ex-
pecting to have considerable difficulty in

    rr

waking him to my surprise he rose im-
mediately without a word and without signs
of weariness

  come on i said and we climbed out
of the box went around to the far side of
the train and climbed to the roof unnoticed

  the coach on the rear end was an ob-
servation-car riding on its roof was hor-
ribly cold and disagreeable i went back
to the rear end of the car and found that
i could climb down to the observation plat-
form i went back and shook my friend

  as before he came without a word we
climbed down found some chairs and an
indian blanket and traveled all night quite
comfortably in the morning we rode into
sparks the end of the division

  we both slept through the greater part
of the journey and awoke at about the
same time shortly after dawn when my
companion had rubbed his eyes and looked
around he asked with mild curiosity where
we were and how we got there to which i
responded that he ought to know as much
about that as any one

  he replied that he certainly did not
know where we were and furthermore that
he had not slept since he had left ogden
utah which by his computation was two
days and two nights before he had met me
he did not seem to remember anything
since he had struck winnemucca the morn-
ing before except meeting the detective

  he wound up with the assertion that the
s p was a mighty poor road to ride on to
which i agreed and once more demanded
to know how he had got where he was

  when informed hetook the matter very
philosophically and told me that he had
always walked in his sleep and that when
he was little his mother could make him
do anything by speaking to him when he
was sleeping from which one might infer
that that was the only time the old lady
could influence him in any way

  we were separated going through the
snow-sheds on the road to san francisco
i was combed off by a state policeman at
the first stop but he got through by crouch-
ing behind a dining-car ventilator i sim-
ply went up to the head end and got into
a day coach i secured a hat check and rode
through to sacramento without question
when we got there joe was not on the roof
and he did not show up in san francisco
though i waited at the market street de-
pot every day for over a week at the place
we had agreed upon

hey may talk of fevers chills

    and a thousand other ills

    that go to make the doctors human code
    but the worst i know of yet-

    makes a fellow fuss and fret-

     is the hopeless restless fever of the road

    with the smoke and grease and dust

     and the cinders oil and rust

    and a million funny friendly railroad smells-

    and the lights-white green and red-

    runnin through a fellows head-

    once hes worked there-why he wont work nowhere else

     they may have their tariffs rates

     and their traffic-sheets and plates

    and the policies that seem to run the line

    but the whir of no 
    when shes twenty overdue

     to me is like the joy of rare old wine

    and i love the busy yard

    with the engines chuggin hard

     and the whistles bells and sweatin swearin crews

observations of a country
station-agent

by j e smith

no -the by-gone combination of telegraph operator and station-
agent who was paid for overtime only when there
were thirty-two days in a month

read a tramp or vagrant article
the other day on the old-time
country physician and the old-
time country circuit-rider pio-
neers of the middle west who
are no more and whose places
can never be taken because there are newer
methods and newer manners and  all things
change

  it brought to my mind the old-time com-
bination telegraph operator and station-
agent who is likewise passing he was
part of the same community as the doctor
and the circuit-rider he filled his niche
and is fast being modified and modernized
by the newer order

  i remember him as a busy important
man in his community-a man harassed
and haunted by a multiplicity of detail
fussy and arbitrary but withal closer in
touch with the affairs of all the people
about him than either the doctor or the
preacher

  on our line the station-agent is no longer
doing the railroad telegraphing

  it is done in towers five miles apart and
by three men on eight-hour shifts

  on the same road twenty-five years ago
there were telegraph offices only every ten
or fifteen miles and the old station-agent
with a paralyzed arm and st vitus jerks
took the orders with one hand billed out
freight with the other held a mail-bag un-
der one arm the express bills between his
teeth and fastened the checks on the trunks
with his toes-all at the same time in one

hocus-pocus movement that was quicker
than the eye and that would have aroused
the envy of the nimblest shell-and-pea
artist

  on our road he is now only a memory
his present-day prototype gives the move-
ment of trains no heed

  the telegraphing has fallen to the man
in the tower who does nothing else

  the towers are furnace heated and built
of steel and cement they are light and
airy and comfortable but always located
at the edge of the town or a little ways out
where passing tracks are possible

   this is a pleasant place to work i as-
sured the first-trick man

   is it  he asked with a missouri accent

   cheerful surroundings i added

   so i am informed he answered with a
suspicious assent all the same if you
had to rivet your gaze on the said surround-
ings eight hours even day three hundred
and sixty-five days in the year for the rest
of your natural life you wouldnt enthuse
over it you wouldnt gush anv - you
wouldnt slop over about it

   scenery is the commonest thing there
is to a tower job but i never heard of an
operator wanting to stay with a tower job
on account of the landscape i never heard
of one hating to leave because he could get
a good view of a turner sunset or feast
his eyes on a rosa bonheur flock of grazers
did you

   anyway i persisted  you havent
anything else to do but telegraph

observations of a country st ati on-agent



   we have to walk out here thats a mile
and a half and we haveto walk back
but you only work eight hours

   add another hour or so getting to it
then throw in sunday and you have about
the same as ten hours per day

  the company should arrange
you out here in a coupe has any one ever
suggested it to em  

  what do those soulless wretches tell

to bring

from eighty to a hundred a month they
dont have the responsibility an operator
has and they dont work much longer and
we only get sixty we got to be educated
to do this work any one can be a brake-
man a second-trick man goes to work
earl- in the afternoon all he gets to see is
the parade no big tent for him misses
evervdiing he dont get off until eleven
or twelve oclock at night cant go any-

when a boy wanted to
learn telegraphing
he hung around
the depot

us lie said this whenever little
willies legs grow weary other pedestrians
are eager and waiting

  i tried the second-trick operator

   an operator has a pretty flossy job these
days compared to twenty-five years ago
i ventured as an introductory observation

  huh he has any one who thinks
a tower jobs a snap ought to be led to it
what do them brakemen get anywhere

where or see anybody hasnt any after-
noons or evenings to himself

  with this melancholy reflection lie tilted
a dinky cap back into an ambush of riotous
hair adjusted his balloon pants so as not
to impair the crease and slid down in his
chair then he fished up a harmonica
and played with fiendish vigor turkey
in the straw adding the virginia skee-
daddle  for extra measure


the railroad mans magazine

  the next number on the evening program
was a song with both guitar and catarrh
accompaniment it was a sad song as i
remember it about a maiden fair and i
think she had hair eyes too if i am not
mistaken she was waiting for him some-
where in the agony of despair with heart-
strings to tear but with a devotion that
would wear with a love nothing could im-

any hour he was subject to the call op
the stranded conductor

pair whereupon i slid out it was too
pathetic

   you have a pretty nice job havent
you i asked of the third-trick man
 only eight hours in this fancy tower and
nothing else

  snough interposed the third-trick
man poising a halting hand  some ones
been stringing you some night when the
wind or the rain or the snow or the sleet
is cutting high jinks its worth a days
labor to get out here to say nothing of the
eight hours and the return trip

   say when a man goes to work at eleven
oclock at night and quits at seven in- the
morning hes got to sleep the rest of the
day aint he hes got to commence hot-
footing along about ten to appear at eleven
where does he get any time when you
say  nice  you got the wrong word try
it again theres a pocket webster in the
second drawer might as well work all
night as to have to poke out about nine-
thirty or ten

  the only eight-hour snap for any man
is from eight to four daylight blocking
trains is particular work and when youre
here youre here dont forget that you
havent a minute for anywhere else you
never see any one and its lonesome work
with only a block wire and the despatchers
wire we cant even hear anything of inter-
est you cant tell us we are better off than
our grandfathers tell it to sweeney 
whats the chances of promotion i
asked all three of them

  chorus

  none from third trick to second to
first once a tower operator always a
tower operator 

   anyway its nice and quiet and you
havent the public to annoy you

  chorus

  thats it solitude its deadly lone-
some come on oh you populace wel-
come to our midst oh you rabble 

   now i can assure the tower operator that
the pioneer operator of a generation ago was
not so keen for the association of his fellow
man fact is he did not have much else

  taking train orders and noting the move-
ment of trains was only incidental to him

  he was either station-agent or first aid
to the agent wherever located usually he
was the whole works he was hung with
titles and marks of eminence like an oriental
prince he was station-agent for the a
and z railway agent for the jeffersonian

by six grave aid learned professors and
titled examiners had not then been evolved

  when a boy wanted to learn telegraph-
ing he hung around the depot until the
agent put him to sweeping out toting the
mail-cars and lugging in the coal

  after a year or more he was ready for
a job he went to it eagerly unadorned
with pants that flapped like a sail unor-
namented with a dinky cap and unembel-
lished with a flowing necktie of seven col-
ors but he knew about what to do when

dust fire so the stove would not blow up
he knew how to truck freight and heave
sample trunks bill out freight and keep
the office accounts

  to-day lie is conducting the railroad
companys business at the important points
hard knocks made him fit

  in the elite and luxuriant present it is
from the perambulator to the hammock to
cushions to the padded-leather office chair
while in the long-departed days the route
lay via the coal-hod and the two - wheel
truck

  the old-time telegraph-office-w jhe depot
lifted many a town to a boasted eminence
over surrounding towns it was the stand-

ard recognition of impor-
tance and they were only
here and there it was an
outlook upon the world it
was the means of quick com-
munication with all other important centers

  the man at the depot who could sit at
the desk in a din of clicks-there were
usually two wires one railroad and one
commercial-and out of the confusion of
noises could reduce a message to writing
that any one could read with the help of
the school-teacher and the postmaster was
looked upon with awe and respect as one
marvelously endowed

  there were no telephones that miracle
came later

  there were but few daily papers and
they were five cents straight preaching the
party doctrine the same way the people
were rampantly partizan elections were
of the knock-down and drag-out variety
where every man was voted-the stripling
youth the senile aged the half dead the
lame the blind and the halt

  i think every old operator will recall
election nights at the country depot crowded
with patriots from all around to get the
returns

  the waiting-room and office were stuffy
and heavy with the breath of politics and
the old oil-lamps burned with a sickly red
from a starvation supply of oxygen

  the old political wheel-horses and bell-
wethers hung close over the operator the


the railroad mans magazine

snort of battle still in their nostrils and the
scent of warfare on their breaths

  then came a portentous hist while
the operator bent low over his instrument
followed by the suppressed exclamation
its coming

  the operator traced something across the
clip-a strange chirography like unto chi-
nese or timbuctoo-but he translated it to
those about him whereupon a boiler-voiced
patriot proceeded to enlighten the throng
by reading aloud with impressive orator-
ical effect

   montpelier vermont-early returns
indicate that vermont has gone republican
by the-

   a yell of triumph drowned the rest of it

  he raises a silencing hand

    hures a nothern

  jefferson mississippi-early indica-
tions are that mississippi has gone demo-
cratic by the-

  triumphant yell no  anwered yell no
 quite equal in volume and intensity and
honors seemed even

  at  pm he sent a message to the
state capital notifying a waiting world that
liberty township had gone democratic
by 

  then came some scattering returns from
new york state and the leaders figured
and speculated  if we come down to har-
lem river with so much well carrv new
york

  the dispute and argument raged over the
operators head until there was a sort of
nebulous conclusion that somewhere on the
line of the harlem river an irresistible
force was about to meet an immovable body
with the usual scientific result and his
majesty take the hindermost

  along about three or four in the morn-
ing the crowd thinned to a remnant and
the operator with spent vitality announced
no more to-night

  then he blew out the lights and stag-
gered for the outside and gulped in the
pure night air like a famishing creature

  an american citizen heavily burdened
and fearful for the fate of the republic
followed him for confidential information
he had yelled long and lustily he thought
the operator might know more than had
been read aloud

  do you think were beat he asked in
smothered confidential tones

   looks like it grunted the operator

  aint that tough id ruther lose a

hundred dollars i tell you an have em
beat us

  he turned back and the gloom of the
night swallowed him up  s

   note that fine american sentiment note
that spirit of sacrifice note that unfal-
tering devotion

  that same fellow had remained perched
upon a fence all the afternoon receiving
alternate deputations of workers from both
parties and was not persuaded until
late in the evening when he went up per-
sonally conducted between two wheel-
horses and voted he remained for the
returns with the old operator to the last
minute and feared the worst

  viewed commercially getting the news
for the people netted the old operator just
two dollars the sovereign citizen got no
more for the part he played two dollars
in this far-away day was a lump sum and
people had to have the telegraphers serv-
ices or remain in darkness

   the old operator had no levers to throw
if he got an order for a train he went out
and hung up a red flag if he was occu-
pied at the moment with other duties he
could easily forget it of course the in-
structions were to put out the flag immedi-
ately on receipt of the train order and
there were specific rules to that effect but
a busy man in all ages of the world will
postpone incidental details from time to
time and in the end forget

   usually as the engine whistled for the
station or came thundering by he would
remember the order and make a wild dash
for the flag this as a rule got the con-
ductor as the engineer did not sign the
order or have it read to him but had only
an impersonal interest in it the conductor
was all that was necessary anyway

  now and then the train got away en-
tirely but so long as nothing happened
and as there were no state or inter-state
commissions to meddle it wasnt such a
serious matter

   after a time some genius conceived the
idea of having a tin wing-signal attached
to the building outside and turned from
inside the office by a lever a rope or a
pulley and save the operator from under-
mining his constitution by exposing him-
self to the elements without while hanging
up a train-order flag

   this raised the mortality rate among op-
erators and placed them in the insurable
class
observations of a country station-agent	

  great forward strides were made about
this time it was found that if a bay
window was put in the telegraph-office an
operator could see a train coming some dis-
tance away simple idea isnt it never-
theless -the early depots were as fiat as the
first school-house or the pioneer church
and were planted within about six feet of
the rail so that the passengers on and off

  the old operator resented the invasion
opposed the onward march and showed his
opposition by just tying the new apparatus
down giving everything a clear track and
went ahead expensing booking way-bill-
ing and blundering as before discipline
finally broke him of the string habit

gered whenever a train came in some of
these buildings remain in service to the
present day

  the world continued to move for very
soon another signal sharp conceived the
idea that if the train-order signal showed
red all the time and the voluntary act of
the operator was required to show white
and permit a train to pass without stop-
ping there could be no failure on the part
of the telegrapher negligence and forget-
fulness would stop the train thus reversing
previous conditions

  we use the semaphore and we also hang
out the little red flag

  in this day of the block and tower the
train-order has been reduced to a scientific
brevity thus

  no  meet no  at bj tower

  a generation ago the trains were min-
utely described by thumb-print measure-
ments and were then formally ordered to
meet and pass at grimes siding

meet had been employed two trains
would have stood at grimes siding nose to
nose in a technical deadlock having
met no provision was indicated for fur-


the railroad mans magazine

ther movement by adding and pass
it was at once clear that one train should
go by the other

  do not smile please this is a mighty
serious article it was a good many years
before the word  meet  was officially made
and finally understood by all to mean
pass

  fine point that shows how a railroad
by education and perseverance can put one
over on noah webster

  the old-time side-wheel operator whose
sending was like the water from a jug
would commence repeating a train - order
sitting down he would gradually come
upright however until he was on his tip-
toes and bending over the table he would
hit the word pass with fifty dots and
would fall over in a dead lump on the dash
in a and call up the reserves for the
concluding dots in the two  ss when
it came to hurdling the word pass the
awkward mitt made it a prolonged ag-
onizing acrobatic feat

  it was absolutely necessary to eliminate
it to save laying out the trains

  then there were the happy holidays for
the old operator when every one went some-
where when all the trains were late when
every one was getting a package or sending
one away when he was overwhelmed with
a beseeching complaining expostulating
public until he blasphemed santa claus

  but with all this there were happy mo-
ments for at regular intervals he would
receive a  death message  for some one
in the country or in a near-by town and
with an office message to deliver by special
messenger there were no telephones
thereupon the old operator would sublet
the delivery contract or hold the message
until night and go himself and clear two
dollars and fifty cents through the special
delivery service which while of doubtful
promptness always came high

  that source of revenue has been elim-
inated the telephone has woven its web
to every mans door and the death mes-
sage is phoned all that comes back is
 thank you

  when there was no night office the old
operator was considered always on duty

  if a train crept into his station in the
night and got on a siding and could not
see the headlight of the train it was to
meet some member of the crew would go
prowling about the village to rout out the
operator any hour of the night he was

subject to the call of the stranded con-
ductor he had no hours he got no extra
pay the only overtime that came his
way was when there happened to be thirty-
two days in the month

  if any one had told that the day would
come when nine hours would -be made the
legal limit of one days labor for the rail-
road operator he would have poohpoohed
taken to his prayers and figured on the end
of the world

  then again there was the public the
great public-always on duty always in-
sistent

  many a night the old operator faithful
and accommodating has laid his head on
his pillow to be rudely awakened after the
first hours deep sleep by a vigorous thump-
ing on the front door

   he collects his drowsy senses is annoyed
but not alarmed and answers from the sec-
ondrstory window

  bill jones wants you to come to the
depot right away  comes the voice from
below

   what does he want  

  i dunno he says its important

  anvbody dead  

  nope

   think hes lookin for something or
somebody  

  i dunno he says for you to come
right over hes waitin there for you

    all right tell him to wait ill be over
after a while

  then the old operator with a little of
the spirit of human cussedness and resent-
ment still surviving within him turns over
and falls into a deeper sleep than ever
while bill jones shifts around on a hard
unfriendly truck blinking at the dog-star
seeing the moon slip behind the great be-
yond and at length slinking away after
a prolonged session with meanness in his
heart and maledictions on the head of the
railroad man that had no accommodation
about him

  nevertheless the old operator answered
the night call many times for mower parts
binder repairs and catalogues for the
farmer comes into the country village only
after he has done his sixteen hours on the
farm and he is not backward about calling
any one out to serve him the merchant
and blacksmith answer the call with cheer-
ful servitude for they need his patronage
the old operator was the first to rebel he
was the pioneer who bowled out the slogan

theres a time for work and a time for
play

  time works changes the old order
passes away one day the store-clerk came
over with a package of collars and cuffs
and expressed them to troy new york
when they came back they were whiter and
more shiny than the finest china and they
were exhibited in the store window as a

   its called a telephone its a contriv-
ance where two people can be a mile apart
and talk to each other and hear just the
same as if they were in this room

  the old operator had his doubts and said
he would have to see and hear one of
them for himself before he would believe
such a story

   that would be lots more convenient

dashery

  then a bold and venturesome grocery-
man received a shipment of fresh oysters
direct from baltimore where nothing but
the canned product had been before the
community began to wake up

  then the school-teacher dropped in and
asked the old operator if he had read any-
thing about the wonderful invention of a
shrewd yankee up in new england by
name of bell 

than telegraphing observed the teacher
 i allow it will take the place of telegraph-
ing some day

   so would perpetual motion be lots more
convenient than the old turbine down at
the grist mill replied the old operator in
subtle defense of the old order of which he
was a trained part and showing suspicion
and distrust of any departure therefrom

  one day a new man breezed in from
chicago

   ill tell you what i saw said he  i


the railroad mans magazine

saw a fellow in  ch  office take a message
right off the wire on a typewriter machine
and never break and there it was just
like print thats telegraphing for you
aint it 

  huh answered the old operator
there was some trick to that ill never
believe theyll get to printing them right
off the wire on machinery until i see em
do it

  the postmaster came over

  whats this i see in the papers he
asked about the railroads dividing up
these united states into eastern time cen-
tral time rocky mountain time and pa-
cific time aint president hayes got eny-
thing to say how this country ought to be
divided up

  as a commissioned servant of the u s
a he was riled

  the old operator could not explain it

  weve always run by columbus time
he explained  but i understand its going
to be st louis time and the times going
to be divided into four parts with an hour
between em every road has its own time
i understand they are going to be made
all the same

   air the railroads going to have the
sun rise and set as usual or air they goin
to change that   asked the postmaster
with sarcasm

   i reckon theyll do about as they durn
please with their own clocks wont they
replied the old operator

  that was long long ago the old op-
erator has gone to his reward tears and
flowers

  the depot where he battled with the pub-
lic has crumbled to dust and a new sta-
tion porte cochered and minareted stands
in its place

  away down the track is a tower where
the three operators on eight - hour shifts
handle the movement of trains with never
a jarring note from the public

  the village has its white houses its
graceful trees its bricked streets and its
happy children

  a young man with rah rah clothes per-
sonally conducted by a young dear thing
with a two-bushel and one-peck hat saun-
ters blithesomely and care-free toward the
tower

  it is the second-trick operator of the
newer order

  a farmer slips up between breaths in his
touring-car for the binder parts the agent
has notified him by phone that they had
just arrived he dont look much like the
farmer of the olden days either

  it is all so different-so much better
pity the old operator could not have lapped
over into the next generation

superheating not a new idea

the superheater is of necessity coming to the
front with rapid strides chiefly owing to the
urgent needs and calls from every quarter for
fuel economy superheating is not a new-fan-
gled idea as some persons suppose the opinion of
some being that the superheater on a locomotive
is something that has been imagined in the mind
of some enthusiast on fuel economy and is con-
sequently additional apparatus with which to fill
up the already crowded front-end of a locomo-
tive and which will result in nothing super-
heating is not by any means a new idea though
at present it is being put to uses that were un-
heard of years ago

  ever since the laws of expansion and con-
traction have become recognized superheating
both of solids and gases has been practised with
a definite purpose in view viz to gain a greater
efficiency out of the substance being heated than
could have been obtained by any other means

  there are two or three known laws that govern
the working of the superheater on a steam-en-
gine from one of these called mariottes law

it is found that the density of a gas increases as
the pressure increases and decreases as the volume
increases from another known as gay-lus-
sacs law we learn that if the pressure remains
constant every increase of temperature oj one
degree f produces in a given quantity of gas an
expansion of  of its volume at  degrees f

  now the principle of this should be very easy
for a fireman to understand in that every degree
of superheat produces an expansion of the steam
which results either in greater pressure if the
volume is constant or in greater volume if the
pressure remains constant the steam generated
in a locomotive-boiler is called saturated steam
and in fact steam in any boiler is in the same con-
dition saturated that is to say it has a certain
amount of moisture with the steam this is due
to the bubbles of steam coming up through the
water being surrounded by a thin film of water
and this thin film naturally causes an amount of
water to become mixed with the steam thus it is
called saturated steam-locomotive firemen and

chapter xxii

when greek meets greek

til waters cantered down the
pike astride of the brown horse
comfortably seated in the sad-
dle urging him on with the long
reins of the bridle he smiled
complacently as the horse broke
into an easy lope he smiled
because it was pretty good work to make a
getaway not only with a horse but with a
saddle and bridle as well

  in the darkness he did not know where
he was going it lacked a few hours of
dawn but the horse seemed to know the
road and seth let him have his way

  he seemed to be a good roadster and he
kept up the same easy steady lope once
or twice seth was inclined to let him out
but he thought it best not to do any hard
riding just then

  when the day dawned he might possibly-
run the risk of sheriffs-then he could let
the brown horse show what was in him in
the way of speed

  as he cantered along he smiled in satis-
faction at the marvelous manner in which
he had made his escape in the first place
fooling the farmer was a ten-strike killing
the dog so deftly before it had a chance to
bark was surely the work of a master
annexing the overalls and the bread to say
nothing of a good horse with a saddle and
bridle placed him beyond all peradventure
in the front rank of the nimble-fingered
gentry who steal for a pastime

  seth was more than proud of himself
having met with such unusual success
since his hastened departure from rosalia

began in the november  railroad

   lie now thought that it would be an easy
   matter to get just what he wanted and at
   any time

     food and transportation were to be his
   for the asking should the man whom he
   might ask deny him-then that man would
   have to pay the penalty

    mile after mile of roadway the brown
  horse covered before the first stars began to
  fade and the gray of a new day appear on
  the horizon when the dawn finally burst
  so that seth could see the country around
  him the horse had slowed down to a walk

     he was approaching a canon he could
  tell from the high hills that surrounded
  him that its entrance was not far off as
  the day grew brighter he took in his new
  surroundings with a whimsical leer on his
  face

     truly luck was playing right into his
  hands

     the horse walked on and on seth did
  riot urge him he would ride into the
  canon find a secluded spot and camp out
  for a day or two he had the two loaves
  of sour bread with him and then a canon
  always indicated water things were com-
  ing his way

     in his heart seth loved the wilderness
   and he loved to be alone eating with
   him was only a means to an end if there
   was a slim chance of getting food-only the
   merest chance - seth was satisfied he
   liked to be alone

     alone with a horse or a dog or the birds
   that caroled in the gay foliage of the cali-
   fornia wonderland-it was all the same to
   him on the gray days when it rained he
   was satisfied to curl himself up under a
   sheltering rock-if that were the only thing
   handy

the railroad mans magazine

  if it were a matter of talking he would
talk aloud to himself or to his horse or
dog he only asked and prayed to be alone
-alone in the mighty world unmolested
free-at will to mount his horse or call his
dog and go whither hismancy directed

  so long as this condition lasted seth
knew that he was safe and so we gather
diat his desire for the lonesome life was
more to satisfy his criminal instincts than
to commune with nature when he picked
out a little white spot just beside a faintly
running stream about a mile or so inside the
canon he was fully satisfied that he was
never so much alone in all his life

  the spot that he selected was surrounded
by a growth of giant sequoia and the
chaparral at its base was thick and home-
like it looked as if no other man had ever
looked on it before the very air he was
breadiing seemed disturbed at the presence
of a human being

  the road that he followed into the new
paradise showed the traces of traffic the
wide-tired wheels of the big covered
schooners and the long narrow hoof-prints
of the patient mules told him that it had
been traversed-but it was evident that he
was the first man who had come to stay

  he had some trouble in reaching the white
spot the underbrush was thick and almost
impenetrable the horse got one or two
pretty bad scratches one of them bled
profusely this worried seth more than
anything else just at that moment

  he tethered the animal under a tree where
it would be hidden from the passing mul-
titude should any part of it happen along
die roadway removing the saddle and
bridle he filled his hat from the stream
washed the horses wounds carefully and
tearing the stolen overalls in strips he
bound the wound that bled

  he bound it tightly first applying a poul-
tice of mud from die bed of the stream and
was soon gratified when the bleeding had
perceptibly ceased he watched it for some
time until it stopped altogether then sat-
isfied that his surgical work was well done
and had taken effect he stretched himself
on the soft grass and went to sleep

  when seth awoke he sat up rather hur-
riedly and naturally looked at his horse
the animal was just where he had tethered
it but strangely it was looking straight
ahead its ears bent forward

   anouier one of those durned panthers
meditated seth

  the horse realizing that seth was awake
neighed in a subdued sort of a way but all
the time it kept looking steadily ahead
seth arose and stood by the animals head

  he peered into die bushes ahead-and
saw a man

  the stranger was a small wiry man
dressed in a somewhat dilapidated suit of
clothes his blue shirt was open at the
neck and his sombrero was pulled down
over his eyes seth would have made two
of him and could have kicked him into the
middle of next week

  seth would have gladly imparted this
information to the stranger and then carried
it into effect-but the stranger was armed

  his foot rested on a fallen stump his
elbow rested on his knee his finger rested

	the trigger of a shining rifle and his
eye rested on seth

  up said the stranger in a voice that
was unusually high-keyed

  seth raised his hands over his head
rather cumbersomely saving as he did

   i aint armed

  turn around said the stranger

  seth turned his hands still above his
head

  the stranger convinced diat seth had
nothin in his hip-pockets ordered him to
step forward

  seth did as he was ordered he walked
to within two feet of the other and
stopped

  the stranger prodded seths wearing ap-
parel with the barrel-end of his rifle all the
time keeping his finger on the trigger while
seth kept his hands in the air then he
knocked off seths hat pried around his
much worn shoes and went through a few
other gyrations until he was absolutely cer-
tain that seth was telling the truth

  all right put em down said the
stranger	

  sedi let his long anus drop to his side
and picked up his hat the stranger step-
ped over die log and slung his rifle over his
shoulder as he did so

   i dont mind meeting you stranger
said sedi but if you will tell how on
eardi you found me here i will deeply
appreciate it

   heard ye snorin replied the litde
man

  snoring remarked sedi

  yes-and just the faintest glimmer
of a smile crept over the little fellows face
-you was a tearin it off at some speed
in the hornets nest



 you dont say

 seth was somewhat surprised at his own
 carelessness he should have waited until
 night before going to sleep

  had a long ride   asked the stranger
  fairly long

 where from

 seth paused before he answered

 over there

 he gave a nod with his head and the
 stranger could have taken any direction that
 pleased his fancy - north east south or
 west

 that road only leads in one direction
 said the armed man

  i know that replied seth

 the crafty seth didnt know he didnt
 know just-jvhere on top of the great wide
 world he really was but whatever the mis-
 sion or motive of the armed man seth was
 not going to divulge even an inkling of his
 ignorance

 it leads to santa maria went on the
 stranger

 santa maria a town about thirty miles
 to the north of rosalia

 seth took it all in without blinking an
 eye

 santa maria the road led to santa
 maria then he had been traveling in a
 sort of a circle and was not so far away
 from rosalia as he had expected

 this information meant a great deal to
 him it meant perhaps his life-but so
 calm remained the muscles of his face that
 the stranger discerned nothing of the whirl-
 ing thoughts in his mind

  fine horse youve got

 the stranger approached the animal and
 stroked his back the horse was no longer
 nervous he realized that the stranger was
 a friend

 where did you get him 

 seth did not answer quite as readily as
 a highwayman of his ability should he
 hesitated just long enough to give his visitor
 an idea that all was not just what it should
 be and then replied

  ive always had him

 the last word had hardly been uttered
 when the stranger said

 no you aint you stole him

 seth had to accept the insult bitter and
 truthful as it was he was unarmed

 cant get in an argument with me
 said seth

  aint no argyment needed long as ye
 tell the truth said die little man

  some philosophy in that thought seth
comes pretty near hitting the bulls-eye

   hes a pretty good animal the stran-
ger continued walking around the horse
and eying him critically  i should say
that he was somethin on the road bet
hell make some distance tween sunrise
and sunset

  then it dawned on seth that the stranger
wanted his horse

chapter xxiii
a deal in the wilderness

t aint got the slightest idea in my nut
the stranger continued that this
horse is yourn im pretty certain thet you
stole him

   suppose i did-if it will please you
any said seth

    it will give me less feelins bout takin
him

  that so seth looked at his man
quizzically

    thets so said the stranger raising
his voice and smiling as if to indicate that
he held four aces and all the trumps in the
little game that he was playing

  he was still walking around the animal
which was now grazing quietly looking at
it with keen eyes

   dont seem to have no brand on him
said the stranger

  never noticed any seth replied
guess youre pretty good at the game
pard never knew a good horse-thief yet
as would take one with a brand if he
could help it

  that almost pierced seths diplomacy
it was all he could do to keep from land-
ing on eis strange companion regardless of
the consequences

   he was that way when i bought him
seth said as soon as he could smother the
anger that was dwarfing his better self

   ha ha ha  the stranger laughed
 say bo he went on  dont come any of
that fool talk with me you stole that
horse and you know it i aint been around
these parts not to know a stolen plug when
i sees one ill bet i could get on his back
now and he would take me straight to the
barn where you found him

  well supposing i did said seth with
determination the stranger being so in-
tent on the point seth thought it best to
take another tack


the railroad mans magazine

  its all the same to me even if you do
confess

  what do you mean by that

   i mean to take him 

  you mean to what

   seth stepped closer to the stranger as he
uttered those words

  just what i said the little man re-
marked with a coolness that made seth
waters wince  i mean to take him i
need that horse in my business come
now look lively i aint got no time to
waste put that there saddle an bridle on
him quick i want to get out of here
seth hesitated

  the stranger made a motion with his
rifle he indicated clearly that business
was his bent

  seth picked up the saddle and slung it
on the horses back he worked slowly
but he was thinking all the time

  he needed time to think he wasnt go-
ing to let this man get away with the game

   just as he was about to put the bridle in
the animals mouth he turned to the stran-
ger and said

  look here pard you aint going to
leave me here-

   get that bridle on-quick  said the
other as he slung his rifle to his armpit

  it was evident that sentiment would have
no effect on this man seth adjusted the
bridle buckled the throat-latch and threw
the reins over the saddle-horn then he
turned to await further orders

   stand ten feet in front of him  the
bandit commanded

  seth measured the distance and came to
a halt	 

  the other man walked to the horse un-
tied the rope by which seth waters had
tethered him and with his rifle firjly
grasped in one hand started to mount

  for some reason or other the horse was
a bit skittish he began to describe a cir-
cle as a horse will when a strange mount
tries to get astride him

  the stranger was unprepared for this
the horse circled and reared the rider
tried hard to get his seat

  seth waters saw his chance

  quick as a flash he dashed he had but
one object in mind just then-the rifle
that weapon was the law and order of the
scene

  ere the stranger was aware seth waters
had the barrel of the gun gripped in his
strong hands

   his grip was the grip of the man who is
desperate and is playing only-to win

   as he tugged at the rifle he gave the
horse several lusty kicks in the belly with
his right foot this made the animal lunge
all the more

   the stranger had one foot in the stirrup
plainly he was on the defensive he hung
onto his gun with a grip of death but seth
was more than a match

  in another moment he had wrested the
rifle from the smaller mans hand he
stepped back a few feet master of the sit-
uation

  the stranger was on the horses back
digging his heels into its flanks he made a
dash for the opening in the chaparral to the
open road

   seth leveled the gun and fired

   the man fell forward the blood gushing
from his mouth he fell head first into the
thick underbrush if he spoke a word seth
did not hear it

   the horse stopped short-frightened and
trembling seth rushed up to the animal
and grabbed the reins

   he administered a kick to the body that
lay motionless at his feet and uttered sev-
eral imprecations which to him were quite
necessary as a parting shot

   the stranger did not hear he had gone
to his reward

   seth wanted to make a complete job of it
so he turned the body over and rifled the
clothing in one of the pockets he found
ten loaded cartridges in another a plug of
tobacco in another a jack-knife that had
been recently sharpened and-to his great
amazement-four dollars and fifty cents in
united states coin

    everything is coming my way he said
as he wrapped the money in his handker-
chief dropped the cartridges in his pocket
took a chew of the weed and mounted the
horse

chapter xxiv
 heads  she is

ue started up the canon leaving the
- body to the tender mercies of the buz-
zards and the wolves thinking it best to
put as much distance as possible between
him and the scene of his most recent depre-
dations he urged the horse to a fast lope

   he rode on at a pretty rapid pace until
it seemed that he had put three miles be-
in the hornets nest



tween him and the scene of the murder
then he let the horse come down to a walk
and between a walk and a canter he trav-
eled on and on

  as the afternoon was waning he found
himself not far from a dilapidated farm-
house it was a low shanty built in an
opening in the canon

  the small yard surrounding it contained
a cow and a horse also a large dog of the
newfoundland variety which barked lustily
as he approached

  there seemed to be chickens and pigs
everywhere-the one cackled noisily and
the others grunted defiance as he rode up
to the front gate

  there was no other form of life visible
seth felt certain that the combined barn-
yard chorus would bring forth any human
being within hearing distance he was not
a little surprised therefore when no hu-
man form came forth to greet him

  placing his hands to his lips he gave a
loud cattle halloo but this only fright-
ened the barnyard into a scamper

  dismounting he walked up to the only
door of the shanty and knocked a faint
rustling inside told him that there was some
one living there

  without further ado-the rifle dangling
from his left hand-setll opened the door
and walked in in the one large room of
the mansion a weak emaciated woman lay
on a rough couch

  she tried to smile seth approached gra-
ciously removing his hat and giving other
assurances that he was to the manor born

  what do you want sir the woman
spoke but her voice was hardly discernible
then she lapsed into silence and the twitch-
ing on her face showed that she was suf-
fering great pain

  i am traveling toward the south
maam replied seth waters in his very
best style  i am hungry and came here
to see if i could purchase food

   i am sick and cannot get up said the
woman  my husband has gone to santa
maria for a doctor i would like to help
you but it is impossible

   your husband gone to santa maria for
a doctor-and you here alone 

  seth looked as if human sympathy were
his with a mortgage

  there was no one to stay with me i
am too weak to get up

  this awful picture of frontier life of
the fortitude and patience of the women
 rr

who braved its hardships that their hus-
bands might have a chance to seek fortune
in an untried and untrodden land touched
the heart of the desperado

  how far is it to santa maria he
asked

   about twelve miles to the southeast
she directed

   that way said seth pointing in the
direction in which he had been traveling

  the woman nodded

  seth waters thanked her and started to
go she spoke to him again-this time a
little louder and with some exertion

   if you are very hungry she said  and
can wait my husband will be here shortly
he will get you something

   no thank you replied seth

  brutal as he was he would not let a
woman think that he would hang around
for food that wasnt seth waterss idea
of the manner in which things should be
done

  had she been strong and well and denied
him food had she asked him to depart like
a common tramp he would have held her
up with his rifle and made her cook the very
best on the place for him but as i have
said food was not a matter of great impor-
tance with this man

  however he left the place with commend-
able courtesy and closed the door then
he slunk around to the kitchen entrance and
stole a piece of bacon that was hanging
near the door

   it may come in handy said seth as
he jumped on his horse and rode in the
direction of santa maria

  he had partly decided to spend a few
days in that old spanish settlement as he
sauntered along he wondered if he really
looked sufficiently respectable to make the
visit

  it had been so long since he had been
where civilization assembled that he began
to wonder if he were quite safe in taking
a risk

  however he would take time to think it
over swerving the horse to one side he
rode up the somewhat steep side of a small
mountain

  he spied a huge rock and a clump of
trees these afforded shelter for himself
and his horse and he was easily pleased at
his selection when he dismounted and looked
around him

  to be sure it wasnt much of a place for
the horse for the grass was pretty short


the railroad mans magazine

and there was no water but the animal had
had his fill only a few hours before and
seth did not worry

  he gathered some sticks and soon had a
fire taking his knife from his pocket he
sliced some of the bacon in the absence
of a pan he held the bacon over the fire
at the end of a long stick he cooked it to
a turn laid the strips on slices of the sour
bread and enjoyed a really good meal

  as he devoured his food he turned over
in his mind all the various points of the
situation

  santa maria was one of those towns
where strangers arrived at all times of the
day or night for at the time of this story
many and peculiar were the wanderers over
the face of the far western country

  men and their families would travel by
horse from the farthermost parts of south-
ern mexico far up into the newly found
el doradoes of wealth which are now the
thriving states of colorado nevada and
california

  they would return to the south with their
well-filled pouches and mingle with the new
faces from the east in these crowds were
men of all kinds and character one might
rub elbows with an honest prospector on
one side and with the most daredevil des-
perado on the other

  it was a common thing for a strange
horseman to ride up in front of a saloon
dismount and walk in and be at home in
a few moments these strangers were usu-
ally well-heeled with pistols and money
no one asked where they got the latter lest
he get a taste of the former

  so taking all these things into consider-
ation seth waters decided that it might not
be bad for his health if he passed a few
days mingling with the bright spirits of
the old town

  it might be a trifle distasteful to his
mode of life to arrive there with just four
dollars and a few cents that wouldnt
go very far it wouldnt buy much liquor
and if he were invited to sit in a poker
game it might vanish with the first pot

  really he should have more money
there was the sick woman whom he had
just left in some corner of her shanty
there might be a hidden stocking contain-
ing some hard-earned savings

  he needed them more than she but-
no he suddenly thought otherwise he
would not rob a woman at least he would
not run the risk of so doing

  attacking a woman was one thing not
tolerated in the variegated system of high-
way robbery of that country there was
some sort of admiration frequently ex-
pressed for a man who could make a clever
horse  deal -as the game of horse-steal-
ing was popularly called-and the cour-
ageous road-agent had his host of worship-
ers but the man who would rob a woman
-he was hunted to his hole and hung

  no it would not do to rob a woman

  seth slept calmly that night beside the
sheltering rock in the early forenoon of
the following day he took a reef in the
horses cinch threw his leg over the saddle
and started down the hill

  when he reached the road he paused for
a moment and took a coin from his pocket

   heads for santa maria he said as
he flipped it in the air

  he caught it on his palm it came
heads

chapter xxv

dead or alive

canta maria boasted of some dozen
 or more saloons in a population of
only several thousand seth stopped at the
first one he saw outside several horses
were hitched to a watering trough and he
found a place for his thirsty mount beside
one of them

  he walked inside a motley crowd was
standing around the fly-bedecked bar and
another crowd was watching a poker game
in a side room seth stepped up to the bar
instinctively the bartender passed over a
glass and a bottle seth threw down a coin
filled his glass and turned resting his
elbow on the bar to drink

  as he did so a small official-looking
notice in a battered frame arrested his at-
tention perhaps he might not have noticed
it had not the top line particularly caught
his eye it read

 reward

  he walked across the room to learn whose
head was worth so much money

  the glass almost dropped from his fin-
gers and the marrow almost froze in his
veins when he found that it was his own

  it read for the capture of seth waters
dead or alive

  dead or alive dead or alive

  seth repeated the words again and again
in the hornets nest



then he read on for the murder of
philip garrick ranchero of rosalia

  a further paragraph announced that the
reward would be jointly paid by the county
authorities and cannita arcana

  seth read it once more so as to get it
well posted in his memory and returned to
the bar

  did you know him asked the bar-
tender stopping in his work of polishing
glasses to become sociable

no said seth give me another
first time i ever see a reward of that
size posted up in this place for a man the
bartender went on  guess they must want
him pretty badly

  why dont they run him-down ask-
ed seth with his most gifted touch of care-
lessness

   theyd have a husky gettin that fel -
ler said the bartender with a smile  hes
the slickest thing thats been in these parts
in years hed shoot on sight or rob in a
minute i guess nobody wants to tackle
him unless he can do so in the dark and
then get the drop on him

   seth did not dislike this rather exagger-
ated opinion of his ability

  he threw the second drink down his
throat

   have one on me said the man behind
the bar passing the bottle

  no thanks seth replied im just
passing through town on my way south-
and that stuff only agrees with me when i
take just a little of it

  he put the change in his pocket and
went once more to the notice again he
read it very carefully especially the rather
minute description of himself

  he had a twinge of fear as he wondered
if he were in any immediate danger he
wished that he could look into a mirror
without being observed to see if the descrip-
tion of his features tallied with his present
appearance he hoped that his recent life
in the wilderness had sufficiently changed
him to render him unrecognizable

  he-turned again the man behind the
bar was looking at him

   seem interested in that he said

   i was just thinking what i would do
if i had that thousand seth replied  its
a lot of money

    bet your life said the bartender

  seth stepped outside and mounted his
pony he rode on into the little town
whose houses were scattered irregularly in

order to give their owners plenty of space
for flowers and sunshine and whose busi-
ness streets were quaint with the idleness
of the period

    dead or alive he repeated k dead or
alive

  he rode on and he saw another saloon
he did not dismount for he thought it best
to go through santa maria at a jog and
make for the hilly wilderness beyond the
citys borders once there he would be
free with his thoughts and his horse and
would plan a journey for the future

  there was the customary amount of
lethargy in the old town no one even
turned a head to notice him-him seth
waters on whose head was a reward of a
thousand dollars if he were captured dead
or alive

   it was a wonderful feeling it thrilled
him the very thought of being able to
ride unnoticed through the streets of the
town when he was wanted-dead or alive

  the situation so thrilled him that he
laughed almost outright then that deadly
notion that has ben the cause of so many
a mans downfall-just cne more drink-
came to him

   just one more drink to celebrate his vic-
tory just one more to the old world and
rosalia and carmita whom he had so
beautifully fooled and he would take his
way to the mountains and the price for his
body would become a relic of the past

   the next saloon was in the center of the
towns activity like the first one that he
visited there were some horses tied to a
trough outside this place seemed to be a
bit gayer than the first there were a
dozen or so men seated on the porch from
the interior came the dulcet tones of man-
dolin and guitar played as only the people
of the southland can play

   the men eyed seth waters rather keenly
as he entered the place-and he seemed to
lie more than usually conscious that he was
being observed then he tried to make
himself think that his imagination was get-
ting the best of him

  as in the former place he ordered a
drink as he lifted it to his lips he turned
and scanned the walls there were more
people in this place than in the other
some of them were standing against the
walls and it was difficult to see but seths
keen eyes peered hither and yon and soon
they rested on the notice posted in a rather
conspicuous place at the end of the bar


the railroad mans magazine

  he swallowed the whisky and sauntered
over to the notice he had left his rifle
outside strapped to his saddle as he thought
it best not to attract too much attention by
bringing it into the place

  perhaps if he had not done so the fol-
lowing incident would not have happened
without the side issue of a struggle

  seth had just turned to go about the
middle of the room two men who had
been watching him closely stepped in front
of him

  one of them leveled a revolver

  hold up your hands seth waters
commanded the armed man

  seth was so terribly taken by surprise
that his breath came in short quick gasps

  ill do as you bid because im un-
armed but im not seth waters

  his hands went over his head

  that dont go with me said the man
with the gun ive seen you a hundred
times over in rosalia seth i know you-
and my friend here knows you

  the speaker was dick clancy a young
rancher who owned a great tract of grazing
lands between rosalia and santa maria
the man with him was tom ferris his
head vaquero he had also been a vaquero
for philip garrick

  in an instant the saloon was in a com-
motion as fire spreads over dry grass the
news that seth waters had been caught
spread throughout santa maria

  search him for his gun said clancy
to ferris

   im unarmed protested waters  my
gun is strapped to my horse i tell you
this is a mistake  he went on loudly
get through with this work and take me
to court ill quickly prove that im not
the man you say i am

  ferris made a hurried search and was
convinced that waters was unarmed

   all right said dick clancy  lower
your arms

  an immense crowd had gathered outside
seth waters was marched to the jail dick
clancy was on one side holding his arm
tom ferris was on the other

  the residents of the town came from all
directions they blocked the street to get
a glimpse of the now famous bandit and
murderer when the entrance to the jail
was reached it was with some difficulty
that he was gotten inside

  once in the custody of the sheriff he
was lodged in a cell he was asked if he

did not care to have a barber trim his beard
and long hair this seth refused if there
was any hope for freedom now it would
be due to his unnatural growth of beard
and there was no law in the land that could
make him shave against his wishes

  however ere the day ended it was pretty
generally agreed that the man in jail in the
little town of santa maria was the real
seth waters and that dick clancy and
tom ferris were th richer by a thousand
dollars and the most excited man of all
was the bartender in the first saloon where
seth stopped he had come breathless to
the jail and had told his story to the sheriff

  that worthv took him to seths cell and
let him have a look at the prisoner

  the young man as he stood in front of
seths cell swore at him

  whats the matter sonny asked
seth

  why didnt you tell me who you were
when you was in my place i might have
had that thousand dollars instead ofthose
two fellows 

  seth waters simply grinned

chapter xxvi
a womans way

ytlford was quickly sent to rosalia

      through that city and on beyond
from mouth to mouth the news was spread
seated in the little room of her old uncles
home carmita first heard it she was sew-
ing the thickest of crepe to her black dress
for she had sworn never to wear color
again philip had been to her the world-
now that he was gone she would always
wear mourning

  she knew that the day would come when
seth waters would be found ever since
the death of philip as day slipped into day
and no news of the man came to rosalia
her friends told her that he would never be
heard from again but carmita was not
of that belief she persisted that he would
some day be brought to justice

  you are foolish they said he is
far beyond danger of apprehension

  i have willed it she replied

  she was sitting in her old uncles home
when a young vaquero dashed up to the
front door

  the horse was flecked and panting the
rider was almost breathless he was one
of the fine young western vaqueros who
in the hornets nest



had herded cattle for years on the ranch
of philip garrick

  carmita saw him dismount she saw
his trembling pony and she read his face
she knew-knew all he did not have to
tell her as she opened the door to let him
enter

    theyve got him  she said excitedly
as the first smile that her face had known in
days illuminated it theyve got him
i know where  

    hes in jail-in santa-santa maria 
the vaquero gasped

  are you game to go there with me
said carmita

   if you wish it madam he replied
 but my horse is all in i must have
another -

   there are horses in my stable she
answered  i have kept them ready day
and night-day and night-waiting for this
i knew this news would come

  will you drive or ride the vaquero
asked

  we can make better time on horse-
back carmita replied  i want to get
there before sundown go to the barn and
help the man saddle the two horses in the
first stalls i will be ready in a moment 

  she dashed up-stairs and put on her
riding habit and a black sombrero she
was ready before the horses when the
vaquero appeared riding one and leading
the other he dismounted with all the gal-
lantry of the gentlemen of his time to assist
her to mount

   before he had a chance to lower his hand
that she might place her foot on it carmita
was in her saddle

    come on  she shouted as she dashed
tlirough the gate

  the vaquero followed but he had some
trouble in catching up mazeppa bound to
the back of a wild steed never rode so
madly as did this woman filled with the
hope of wreaking the vengeance that she
had harbored in her soul ever since her
hearts ideal was killed

   her horses hoofs kicked up a cloud of
dust as he galloped on-and for some miles
this was the only guide that her companion
had to keep him in her path

  carmitas teeth were clenched as he
dashed madly on she urged her steed at
every faltering sign in his gait

   now and then she felt the small pistol
which was strapped to her waist she want-
ed to be sure that it was there she might

     a	

have to use it why had she been prac-
tising with it so much of late

  just outside the limits of santa maria
she reined up and dismounted

  taking a handful of grass from the road-
side she wiped the foam that had flecked
her horses body her companion cantered
up she bade him do likewise he obeyed
without parley

  in a few moments the animals had re-
gained some of their wind and looked as if
they had not been driven beyond human
endurance

  carmita did not want to attract too much
attention as she entered the city the hour
was somewhat late and a woman on a hard-
ridden horse might be more than ordinarily
noticed so they entered the town more
slowly

    do you know where the jail is located  
she asked

  her companion replied that he could
take her straight to its door

  in ten minutes they were there carmita
was the first to dismount she handed her
reins to her companion saying

  wait here

  in another moment she knocked on the
door of the jail the sheriff opened it and
she entered

  she told him who she was and of her
interest in the prisoner she told him that
she had come all that long distance to
identify him

   at her urgent request the sheriff took her
to seth waterss cell he was stretched on
the hard couch his body heaving witli the
regularity of sleep

   the sheriff called to him but he did not
respond then that officer entered the cell
and awoke him seth sat up and looked
at his jailer

   a lady to see you said the sheriff

  seth waters only grunted he had little
or no use for women his first thought
was that some religious fanatic had come
to help him save his soul he did not
want to see a woman and he plainly said so

  this lady has come some way to see
you the sheriff continued  i think she
knows you get up anyhow

  seth stood up and faced carmita

  she looked at him with the keenness of a
lynx she eyed him from head to foot
through the prison bars

  then her eyes filled with tears there
he was she knew him she had seen him
around rosalia and the store kept by old


the railroad mans magazine

eugene too many times not to know him
and not to be able to recognize him through
any disguise whether real or false

  there stood the man who had murdered
the only man in the world she had ever
loved there stood the man who had
brought more unhappiness into her life than
life itself there stood the man she hated
that she loathed as one would loathe a viper
there stood seth waters

  the tears came to her eyes for a mo-
ment shelost control of herself and caught
the bars for support then she regained
her strength and her courage

  seth waters stood before her the pic-
ture of sheepish docility surely this was
the most trying situation in which he had
ever been placed

  seth waters said carmita i know
you i know you and you cant get awav
from that i would know you among a
thousand men tell me are you sorry
are you sorry for the misery that you
brought to me  

   am i sorry-for what   he replied
you are mistaken madam

  the sheriff was called into his private
office the two were left alone

  you killed philip garrick she said
you shot him down in cold blood

   i never shot him-or any other man
protested waters

 you lie you lie you dog-you lie 
carmita turned white with rage step-
ping back a few feet she drew her revolver
she had kept it carefully concealed until
now

  leveling it at the man in the cell she
said

   seth waters prepare to meet vour
god 

  dont shoot-dont he cried

 carmita continued	

   such men as you do not deserve a trial
you ought to be shot like dogs 

  he saw that she was desperate he
reached through the bars his long arms
were stretched to their fullest his long fin-
gers clutched in the madness of a caged
beast he ran into a corner of the cell and
crouched there 

the

    dont shoot dont dont shoot help
help he yelled

   carmita stepped to the bars and took de-
liberate aim seth waters cried once more
-this time for pardon for the first time
in his crime-filled life he was at the mercy
of another and-a woman at that

   carmita pulled the trigger seth waters
rose to his feet with startling suddenness
and placed his hands on his heart

   his cries were silenced he fell to the
stone floor-dead

   there was commotion in the other cells
but carmita was undisturbed the sheriff
and several of the trusties rushed to her
with blanched faces

   before they had time to speak she told
them what she had done

   handing her revolver to the sheriff she
said calmly but with deliberation

   i have avenged the death of philip
garrick i have killed the man who mur-
dered him i swore that i would do it
you may do with me as you please

    who are you madam  asked the sher-
iff taking the weapon and leading her to
his office

   i am carmita arcana philip garrick
was the man i loved

   that niht the vaquero rode back to ro-
salia alone the next day by universal
request carmita was given her liberty the
old governor of the state knew her and
knew that she had told the truth she
returned to old caillos home

  years afterward i saw her there she
was still the same beautiful carmita the
white hairs had come to her but her face
had all of its old glory and wonder

   she had never forgotten the vow that she
had made to her lover her maker and
herself-that she would marry no man but
philip garrick

  through all her life she devoted her-
self to the old catholic mission at rosalia
patiently and calmly waiting for the final
call when she would join philip across the
great shadow

   in the little acre of god that nestles in
the shade of mount whitney their graves
are side by side

the miracle of the mails

by thaddeus s dayton

handling the united states mail is a sacred duty and the government
on whom this duty is imposed fully recognizes the importance of its
sacredness if you post a letter with a two-cent stamp in the right
hand corner of the envelope that letter is the property of the united states until
it is delivered at its destination and the government has only one object in view
-to deliver that letter with the greatest possible speed wherever it is destined
to go within the limits of the two-cent rate

    perhaps no other country in the world handles so much mail matter as the
united states if it were not for the splendidly equipped r m s the alert
and keen-eyed clerks and the fast mail trains-what would the mail service
amount to the railroads truly are the backbone of this gigantic scheme of
perpetual motion handling over twenty billion pieces of mail a year

uncle sams gigantic task as a letter-carrier and what he does with
the aid of thelrailroads to make his service

a success

      t is the luncheon-hour at slug 
         cases big printing - house in
         pearl street new york the
         machines have stopped a hun-
         dred girls are gathered in groups
         -eating chatting and giggling
         over on a window - ledge her forehead
         puckered one of them is busily writing

  she has the stub of a pencil and some
coarse white paper taken from a pile by
one of the presses her pencil makes hard
work of it but the page fills steadily

  its to jack up in alaska barrow is
the name of the place wherever that is
she says  i must mail it to-night it is
something i must tell him at once

  barrow is one of the most northerly post-
offices in the world no telegraph-wires
have been stretched there

  with infinite care and effort she finishes
the letter just as the whistle shrills its sum-
mons back to work hastily she addresses
it and shoves it in the pocket of her work
apron

  down in wall street at the same hour
there is a meeting of a board of directors
composed of dignified powerful men whose
wealth foots up millions it is necessary to
get word immediately to a member of their
company also in barrow the letter must
reach him as swiftly as possible the mail
is the only resource the board calls up
the post-office

  if you get the letter to us by seven
to-night it will catch the next boat out
from seattle there is mail service there
but three times a year replies the post-
office

  the printing-house girl posts the letter
to her sweetheart in a box under the brook-
lyn bridge a few minutes after six oclock
it reaches the post-office at the same time
as the bulky linen envelope from the board
of directors millions are behind the one
the commercial enterprise and force of men
of great financial power and only the love
in a girls heart behind the other but the
united states makes  distinction the




the railroad mans magazine

shabby pencil-scrawled envelope of the girl
rushes across the continent with the same
speed as the fat and valuable package that
is smeared with stamps and redolent with
importance

  when these two letters reached the post-
office they fell into a mass of mail that con-
stantly heaped up and then spread out like
the waves of a great river-hundreds of
thousands of letters to ever part of the
country and for every corner of the world-
a flood that had no end

  men were ready for them the number
did not dismay them each package-stamp
was the pledge of the government for speedy
service wagons were on hand to convey
them to the waiting mail-trains

  any other body of men would have been
confused but not the united states post-
office with incredible swiftness these
heaps of mail were sorted and these two
letters bound for the most northerly post-
office on the western hemisphere were
thrown into the compartment marked  se-
attle with hundreds more

uncle sam has the right of way

  inside the hour with tens of thousands
more they started their journey across the
continent with never a second of delay
every postage-stamp is an imperative com-
mand to hurry hurry hurry it is the gov-
ernments vast and complex task to deliver
letters of its citizens it is the far-flung
lines of steel the trains hurrying at breath-
less speed that make possible the daily
miracle of the mails

  in their journey westward these two
alaska-bound letters reached a city that was
tied hand and foot with a big and bitter
strike not a wheel was turning in the
railroad yards sullenly the strikers and
the stricken faced each other but the fast
mail-train whizzed by just as it had every
day for years

  other great interests might be tampered
with and delayed but not the postal service
of the united states

  only war or the forces of nature can
stop the progress of the mails in the cities
the wagons of the post-office department
have the right of way over all other vehi-
cles when the rails are blocked the first
cars that go forward are those marked
united states mail on the high seas
the mail - steamers are forbidden to stop
merely to save property they may pause

  in their rush across the ocean only to rescue
imperiled lives

  at seattle the boat that was to carry the
alaskan mail was waiting ready to cast off
its lines as soon as the pouch of letters was
aboard it was only a little pouch but the
steamer waited for it just the same

  through desolate -seas where the fog
hangs thick over long trails across the
mountain ranges that towered above endless
leagues of black forest-by steam by dog
by man-the two letters posted in the center
of the metropolis of the western world
moved forward and northward

  the pouch that held them was as lean as
the dogs that toiled onward with the sledge
it was the same sort of grimy sack of can-
vas and leather stenciled with the initials
of the republic that holds the letters wher-
ever the flag flies

  here is one problem of the hundreds
of thousands that the postal service of the
united states has to solve aided by the
railroads it is no more difficult than in-
numerable others it is only more pic
turesque

  at any cost at the expense of any ef-
fort the government must deliver with all
possible speed the letters entrusted to its
care the motto of the old  star route 
service still prevails- certainty celerity
and security

  by fast mail - train by stage by any
other means of transportation possible the
government must deliver letters to alaska
the philippines to any town within its
dominion no matter how remote every
impediment of time and distance must be
surmounted thus in alaska all other
plans failing the reindeer post came into
play

the railroads little bill

  only once a year and then during the
summer mail can reach barrow by water
the two other mails a year must be carried
overland reindeer have proved the only
method here is a condition where neither
man-power steam-power nor dog-power
can prevail

  twice a year therefore in this part of
alaska lone figures wait in the red-roofed
schoolhouse or on the snow-banks for the
incoming mail the sledge with three rein-
deer hitched tandem

only thirty- civilized people live in bar-
row but it is just as important in the eyes
of the postal service of the united states to
the miracle of the mails



get letters to this little community as it is
to deliver them to some populous city that
is linked to the rest of the country by all
the facilities of modern transportation

  it is even more important for enormous
sums have to be spent to make service like
this in out-of-the-way parts of the world
as adequate as possible it is a profitable
proposition to deliver many times a day-
huge quantities of mail to cities like chi-
cago philadelphia boston and new york
but when it comes to the few letters that
are destined to far-off places it is a very
different affair

  so	the two-cent stamp that mary smith
put on her letter to her sweetheart at bar-
row represents but a thousandth part of
what it cost the government to deliver it

 lo the railroads

  the importance of the railroads in this
problem of postal transportation may be
gaged by the fact that in  the govern-
ment paid the railway companies close to
 for hauling the mails this
enormous sum is nearly twenty - five per
cent of the total expenditures of this branch
of the federal service in addition to this
the post-office department paid over -
 to its  railway postal clerks
that year

  nearly  is indeed a stupen-
dous sum but when the railroads and the
part they play in postal service come to be
analyzed in connection with the huge
amount of detail work they are turning out
daily even this vast amount seems small
for the railroads not only carry the mails
from place to place but while doing so they
are transporting on their trains  trav-
eling post-offices where each hour of every
run letters by the hundreds of thousands
are being sorted for distribution

  a bare statement of this sort is only in-
teresting in a statistical way but here is an
instance of how the mails are handled when
they are being whirled rapidly across the
country at an average speed of forty miles an
hour taking all trains-not only the limited
but the slower ones-into the average

  if the mails were to wait in the post-
offices until they were properly sorted and
distributed there would be n tremendous
delay it is probable that in a large num-
ber of cases it would take from twelve to
twenty-four hours longer for the mails to
reach their destinations on fast mail-

  trains everything possible is sorted after
the train starts

  it takes nine hours for the fast mail to
reach new york city from pittsburgh over
the pennsylvania railroad on that train
the four postal clerks sort out on each trip
from  to  letters they make
them up in small packages for the different
sections of the cities of philadelphia and
new york each branch office in these
cities gets a package or perhaps even more
than one of the letters that are to be dis-
tributed in the territory that it covers

  not only this but special packets are
made up for each of the large hotels banks
department-stores and commercial houses
that is the way the railway mail works
doing everything it possibly can to save
time by seconds and minutes

  sixteen per cent of all the mail in the
united states originates in new york city
eleven per cent in chicago while boston
and new england originate about eight
per cent it is the gigantic publishing in-
terests of new york that raise this per-
centage so high the mail-order business in
chicago being largely responsible for that
citys having the second place

   the entire country is divided into eleven
parts for the systematic working of this
railway mail service the division superin-
tendents being stationed in boston new
york washington atlanta cincinnati
chicago st louis san francisco cleve-
land st paul and fort worth texas

  people are so accustomed to getting let-
ters without delay that they do not stop to
think of the complicated machinery neces-
sary for delivery

 mail-trains a day

   naturally that division of the east that
comprises the states of new york new
jersey pennsylvania and delaware and
the eastern shore of maryland has the
largest daily individual share of this busi-
ness other divisions may perform prodi-
gies in quick deliveries but this second di-
vision of the railway mail service-the first
is at boston-has its daily schedule of

	mail - trains of these  are
what are known as baggagemens trains
-that is carrying only closed pouches for
the south and west this leaves 
distinct movements in this territory every
twenty-four hours where distribution in
mail-cars is going on


the railroad mans magazine

  all mail service on the railroads is in-
cidental to passenger business the pas-
sengers are first considered from a revenue-
earning point of view on all fast trains and
the mail service is comparatively insignifi-
cant

  except for the rather empty honor of
being mail-carriers and hence having the
most speedy service between given points
it would as a matter of fact pay the rail-
roads better not to carry the mails at all

  even the experts in the post-office de-
partment concede that the railroads are be-
ing paid only about half what should come
to them they have to furnish cars and
adapt their schedules so as to provide for
innumerable connections and in the long
run the business is highly unprofitable to
them

   altogether a superior sort of service has
to be given on the new york central
lines from new york to buffalo  trains
a day are run for mail service this is
probably the largest account on the govern-
ment books with any railroad

  the new york central is now being
paid annually nearly  with an
additional allowance of  for postal-
cars this is at the rate of  a
mile of road a year for  pounds of
mail a day on the average that is hauled
over  miles

  thus one single railroad gets more than
one-twenfy-fifth of the total governmental
expenditure for this purpose

  this happens to be because this road
carries an enormous quantity of through
mail and has a number of big cities and
prosperous smaller towns along its tracks

how the rates are made

   it is interesting to turn from this to the
heaviest postal weight carried on any rail-
road route of the country this is be-
tween new york and philadelphia over the
pennsylvania lines the run here is short
-only ninety miles the government pays
this company a little less than  a
year but a much higher rate a mile per
annum--for an average of a
little less than  pounds daily

  the government lias a peculiar way of
paying for the mail service it weighs the
mails once every four years dividing the
entire country into four sections and over a
period of ninety days weighs every pouch
and every package in one of these divisions

each year section  embracing the entire
east was weighed in the spring of 
it takes almost a year for the governments
experts to tabulate the figures and estab-
lish new average rates for the succeeding
four years

  notwithstanding the fact that these four
great railroad divisions are known in the
post-office department as contract sec-
tions the railroads really make no con-
tracts at all the nearest they come to it
is signing at each weighing what is
known as a distance circular this is
a statement on the part of each railroad as
to the number of miles and fractions of a
mile between each of its stations it is re-
quired by the government in order that it
may take financial advantage of any short-
ening of the lines that has occurred during
the preceding four years

 pieces of mail

  the road that signs this  distance cir-
cular  also agrees according to the printed
statement to carry the mail in accordance
with the government regulations that
means at the rate fixed by law what the
government pays is  cents for each
mile traversed in  the latest year
that has been calculated the postal-cars of
america traveled  miles-equal
to about two round trips to the sun

  as to the rights of the railroads in these
postal - carrying matters former congress-
man jesse overstreet of indiana when he
was chairman of the post-office committee
of the house of representatives said in a
speech that in his opinion the railroads
were not alone obliged to carry mail at he
direction of the government but that every
trolley-car could be pressed into service if
necessary and be forced to become a mail-
carrier

  during  the railway post-offices-
the postal-cars on the trains-assorted and
reassorted  pieces of mail
twelve billion was first-class mail as to
this a leading post-office authority recently
said

   it is estimated that during the fiscal
year  the public posted about -
 pieces of first-class mail and about
 pieces of other classes-all
for domestic destination of the first-class
mail about seventy-five per cent was des-
patched to railroads and of the other
classes over ninety-seven per cent

          a cub operator kicks so hard at fate that
          he manages to block a train-robbery

hen the big atlantic
  rumbled out onto the
  table groomed and
  polished to the very last
  touch dan thomas
  her grizzled old driver
  was there to look her over

  there was fast work cut out for  that
night and she was one of the few on the
line that was able and fit to swing the trick
she and her engineer dan thomas

  evenin dick said dan turning to
the ruddy fireman fresh from the bunk-house
and ready for his run  hows your work-
in-pressure readin to-night

   poppin dan was the hearty response
 got a white feather showin and the gage
cornin up steady never felt better in my
life and if the symptoms was any stronger
i reckon id git a right smart uneasy

   mighty glad youre feelin fit was
dan thomass quiet comment youll need

voull need all your surplus ginger to-night



the railroad mans magazine

all your surplus ginger to-night dick-and
then some

  whats on particular queried dick
throwing his bundle to the gangway

  theyre givin us  away behind the
card to-night along with mighty sharp or-
ders to close up the gap in the schedule over
our division and its goin to eat up a lot
of steam to do it said dan as he started
across the tracks for the despatchers office

  the rails had been bad on the eastern
side of the divide all the afternoon and dan
thomas would pick up the heavy limited
at the top of the big hill nearly an hour
late almost all the way over his division
the run was a drift down into the valley-
through the foothills it was true but there
was a good deal of level track and some
grades to negotiate and with the almost
endless tortuous curves it was anything
but the easiest run on the line

  to the officials of the road however
there were very urgent reasons why the
sealed express-car on that train should be
in ogden on time to be sure of making con-
nections with the espee for frisco and they
intended that it should be or would know
the reason why as it was their greatest con-
cern to get it off their hands and on to
another line the general superintendent
was aboard and a number of officers repre-
senting the express company-all of them
men who were a good deal handier with a
forty-five than with a pen if anything was
to happen to that car on its way to the frisco
mint they wanted to be present

  on the train was a telegraph-operator
equipped with what the old linemen know
as an emergency outfit and in case of an
attempted hold-up they were prepared to
tap the wires at any point for the purpose
of sending out a general alarm in all direc-
tions several disastrous experiences in re-
cent years had made the management cau-
tious and they were determined in this case
to play the winning hand

  hully gee but aint it hot four ways
from the big oven to-night sighed joe
as he pushed his chair away from the rough
little telegraph-table walked over to the
window and raised it then he propped
back the screechy little door so that it was
open wide

    its as hot as its lonesome out here in
these man-deserted foothills he raised
his elbow and leaned against the door-frame
drawing a breath of fresh air into his lungs
as he looked off over the darkened range

  i dont reckon it ever gits much hotter
than it is right now after that hill-ripping
thunder-storm even down in death valley
and if its any more lonesome there then i
pity the poor souls who go through the agony
of dyin in its forsaken confines

  if a fellow wanted to take up the long
trail quiet-like with no one around to make
a scene i reckon he couldnt select a more
forlorn and lonely spot than this here tiger-
tail sidin to make his start from if its
on the map i dont want no acquaintance
with the location thats all it sure is the
limit

   joe resumed his seat and the interrupted
task of writing a task to which he devoted
unusual care for it was a letter intended
for a certain other lonesome individual just
across the divide whom joe had reluctantly-
left behind when they sent him to take his
turn on duty at one of the desolate little
work-train sidings among the foothills

	it was a trick the boys were all given a
turn at during the course of their breaking
in but joe had chafed at it more than the
others because a few of them had been torn
from a daily communion with the only girl

  joe did the best he could however to
bridge the unspeakable chasm with two let-
ters a day handed to friendly trainmen
fastened to the little bows he fashioned of
twigs to slip over an outstretched arm as the
trains whirled by

   it was easier for him to write out the few
messages that came in to him over the wire
than to shape up things he wanted to say in
a love-letter so joe filled and lit another
pipe and pondered deeply

  he was soon in the throes of creation
again the up-curling smoke from his pipe
rising and drifting lazily out through open
door and window the pungent aroma of the
burning tobacco acting as a sedative to his
whirring brain

  three times the instrument near him
sounded his call joe however was far
away over the divide where two brown eyes
were looking dreamily into his and he did
not hear

  what were sounders and calls and des-
patches and orders and even railroads
when-then joe came back

  the despatcher was getting desperate
and he was hammering joes call over the
wire in jig time when joe straightened with
a start reached over and answered the call

  then there were some sharp questions to
answer as to the delay and in the inter-
at tiger-tail siding



missions the sounder snapped out some
stinging personalities about absence from
post and inattention to duty that put joe
on his fighting edge but the chief was 
the wire so joe wisely held his hand

  the order told him that no  was car-
rying a special consignment of express which
was good reason for giving the line more
than the ordinary attention that night all
lights and switches were to be immediately
inspected and tested and the operators re-

down to his fingers- i wonder why dan
quit the key in his prime and took to firin
on the line he sure was a past master at
jigglin the key couldnt any of em send
or take faster than him

queer thing that and joe drew
another match along the leg of his overalls

     joe let me give you a tip says dan
the day he got me my first job

  i had a surprise-party handed me
proper one night shortly before i give up

with the litheness of a panther the first moved
across the room

port filed at once he was to report every
thirty minutes thereafter they werent ta-
king any chances of a loose facing-point pi-
ling her up along the line on her run that
night

   so long you cranky old snappin turtle
joe growled when the chief had cut out and
he had his order on the board  i guess 
wont muss up my front yard on account of
a loose switch at this no-mans turn-out
dans known me ever since he began pound-
ing the code into my pate way back when
he was still workin the key an he always
found me johnny-on-the-spot every time
the game was called

  joe pushed his chair aside picked up a
lantern and raised the globe to light it for
his round of the switches

   i wonder- and joe let the match burn

the key he goes on  it caught me right
off the reel ivhen i wasnt lookin an it got
my nerve

  and this is the tip says he dont
you ever get rattled just because something
happens to drop on you no matter what
it is

   the yellow streak is barred in the rail-
road game kid i remember dan con-
cluded very emphatic  so if you ever get
anything handed to you why dont go up in
the air but just hang on and do business
regular without gettin it tangled up  and
joe was on his way to the switches

  when he had gone a swarthy face ap-
peared in the rear doorway with a look
in the direction of the receding lantern he
crossed the floor to the table and picked up
the copy of the order joe had just written


the railroad mans magazine

    so he grunted  thuh tips straight
got thuh stuff aboard an rushin it through
oh yes the switches will be all right ole
lioss dont you worry about that and he
disappeared in the darkness to the east of
the shanty

  theyre right as a clock mr snappin
turtle and joe slid the lantern on the ta-
ble opened his key and called the despatch-
er tersely sending his report

   relighting his pipe he hitched his chair
close to the table and with half an hour on
his hands before making his next report he
was soon absorbed in the more pleasing
work of finishing the interrupted letter

  again joes mind went trailing over the
mountains and oblivious to his surround-
ings he was unaware of the presence of the
burly form that soon appeared in the little
doorway at his back

   besides the first there was soon another
and at their heels came a third with the
litheness of a panther the first moved across
the room and with the sweep of an up-
raised arm the butt of a heavy revolver
landed in a stinging blow on the side of joes
head

   got him easy bill and other feet
clattered over the rough-planked floor

  wheres thuh string hes plumb stiff
an mighty like stay asleep till mornin
but theres no use invitin trouble by takin
a chance git thuh rope on his mitts an
tie em sos he cant wiggle a finger

   there now set him back an lash him
tuh th chair sos he cant work loose if lie
does come out of it and the light rope was
wound around his arms and body crossed
and knotted to the back and seat of the
chair so hard and tight that there was little
leeway for the unconscious man to breathe

  not enough rope for his legs eh
well what of it he aint a goin to do no
walkin in his sleep an he cant untie no
knots with his feet hes helpless as a
stuffed jack-rabbit

  put your pliers away jack if we cut
the wires theyll be looking for trouble and
have a special out after us in no time just
leave the key shut the way it is and theyll
more than likely think hes gone to sleep 
duty he doesnt look like hed lie able to
send any messages for a while

  outside there was the clank of iron as a
switcli-bar was shifted and fell into place
and the eastern switch was open number
  was running against trouble now

  if dan caught the red in time to stop

the outcome would depend on how well the
special crew on  were prepared to fight
if he didnt  would be ready for the
wreck train and the scrap-yard

  the noisy little clock had ticked off half
an hour when the inert form on the chair
quivered a spasm of trembling ran over
the body the muscles twitched the fingers
unclasped and joe stirred then was still

  another ten minutes and he moved again
there was a mumbling of inarticulate words
and gradually into his dazed brain came a
blurred conception of what had happened

  as he gradually regained the use of his
muscles he strained at the cords that held
him he was helpless but awake at last

  you murderin devils if you hadnt
roped and liog-tied me so bloomin well
id soon have the whole line listenin to
me and joe struggled to shift his chair
across the room toward his key

   if i can only git dose enough to reach
that key with my chin why maybe i-
his foot slipped and struck heavily against
the battery-jar under the end of the table
 hully mackerel if i wreck that juice-tank
the plays off and joe again turned his
head toward the goal he was striving for his
key on the table to the right

  great howlin wildcats he exclaimed
as he found himself unable to budge the
chair any farther theyve got th block
on me goin an coinin theyve lashed
one of the chair-legs to that spike in the
wall the keys closed an sos th game i
reckon

  his head bowed in despair as he realized
his helplessness suddenly he looked at
the clock

   forty-five he muttered reflectively
 forty-five if dans got back the lost
time s jest about pullin out o her last
stop on the run-that is till she strikes this
lay-out and joes head again bent over
his breast

  with a mental picture of disaster that
was to follow torturing his aching brain
to desperation he shuffled his feet on the
floor in a frenzy of anxiety and again there
came the clink of glass as his shoe struck
the battery-jar

  you thievin coyotes he cried and
began working his feet feverishly toward
the jar  theres just one more bet to make
in this pot-an the bettins up to me im
goin to call your hand jest to show you i
aint of the four-flushin breed i think i
got you topped at that
at tiger-tail siding



  crowding down in his chair as much as
the ropes would permit he stretched his right
leg toward the wall and soon had worked
a battery-jar at least six inches closer he
drew it inch by inch toward him until he
could place his foot over its edge then
with his toe in a loop of the wire that led
to the zinc plate on top he raised it gently
from its position tediously but surely he
lifted it until it was free of its liquid bath
and the sounder on the
table gave a sharp click

he then lowered it to the
solution and the sounder
clicked again

 with every muscle
strained and his nerves at
highest tension he began
working the plate up and
down with methodical in-
tervals between the con-
tacts of zinc and liquid
that he hoped w o u  d
be understood somewhere
along the line

  it was slow work the
dots and dashes were long
drawn out the message
lacked the speed of a nim-
ble finger on the key but
joe was getting his warn-
ing on the wire even
though it was in a toil-
some painful way

  the message was short
only four words and his
signature but it required
a full minute to work it
out with his foot

  after all however it
was an uncertainty in the
end for there came no an-
swering tap on his sound-
er the trick might fail in turning yet
heedless of that he continued with the
dogged perseverance of a man playing a
losing game pluckily to the end each
minute the message was repeated over and
over again

  what yuh got there sang out dick
as thomas climbed aboard the engine with
a bundle wrapped in a small flour-sack
 some neighbors back fence tenor youre
takin out for a farewell tour of the line

  cats be shot thats the quickest way
with em anyhow and dan raised the lid
of his seat and dropped the package inside

 its a couple of pounds of good strong
smokin for joe down at tiger-tail sidin
im thinkin hes lonesome in that dump o
nights an hell be burnin the heart out of
his pipe for company when he can git the
right fillins an i know the kind he likes
bettern any other

  always had a soft spot for joe said
dick giving the bell-cord a pull as dan
answered the signal to back out on the line

  id back him in any game he played
said dan as he set  rolling out

  as she bumped gently against the for-
ward car of the limited the superintendent
pulled himself up into the cab with a
glance at the gage he laid his hand on dans
shoulder

   hows your nerve to-night thomas  
was his familiar greeting

  about on a par with the steam-gage
up there mr daniels was dans good-
natured reply as he turned his head toward
the boiler-head  and i reckon its regis-
terin about all she ought to carry

  thats good said the superintendent

tediously but surely he lifted it until it was free
of its liquid bath


the railroad mans magazine

stepping close to dan perched on his seat

 i want you to give her the whip to-night
get every possible turn out of her on the
straightaways and take every curve that will
stand the strain on speed

  catching the hand-rail he was about to
swing down when he called back

    millers handing you the ball so youre
off remember youve got to make the
junction on the card do you get that
all right and he was gone

   depend on this husky to keep the pot
a boilin was dicks comment as the 
took the slack out of the couplings and
picked up the heavy load in her wake

   after all that he can depend on me to
run her in on time providin she holds to-
gether even if i have to drag in some of
the track and a part of the road-bed along
with it dan gradually opened up the
throttle as she clattered through the switches
cleared the yards and started on her long
race against time that was to make a record
for the division

  there were only three stops to make on
the run and they were far between after
they swung through hell gate she began
the four-thousand-foot drift into the foot-
hills through the frying pan country and
into red rock canon

  dick was leaving behind him a volcanic
trail of black smoke and cinders as the long
string of lights reeled and whirled down
the crooked passes while dan sat stolid
and rigid as part of the cab-fixtures his
keen eye following the lines of steel ahead
his one determination being to catch the
schedule if the curves held and she stuck to
the track

  with the mighty roar of mountain thun-
der  was sweeping around the benches
through the cuts and over bridges her
flanges grinding fire on the sharp curves
her eccentrics as close up as she would cut
her steam

  there was but one more stop to make
and with only forty miles from there on to
cover over straighter track she had a fight-
ing chance of recovering all her lost time
dan was making good although he knew
he was putting a terrific strain on both
train and track to do it

  when the lights of the last little town
before their next stop loomed ahead dan
whistled for the yards cut her off to ease
her up on the switches then removed the
gauntlet from his hand drew a kerchief
from his blouse and wiped the sweat from

his perspiring face and neck as he finished
they approached the last switch-lights and
replacing his kerchief he reached up to open
the throttle and gave her full head again

  when the bar was out and  was set-
tling into her long strides once more dan
reached to his hip and produced a heavy
black plug of tobacco hed been too busy
to enjoy a surreptitious bite until now and
he felt that he had earned the luxury of a
chew after covering the longest and hardest
end of the nights run with the schedule as-
sured for his division the book of regu-
lations had a paragraph of protest against
the use of the weed on duty but they were
still more specific against making such
reckless speed over this division for that
matter he had disregarded the last on
orders he could now afford to disregard the
first on inclination

   at the last stop before the final spurt
into the end of the division dan looked
over his machine his deft hand testing the
temperature of the various bearings with ex-
ceeding care while his can was busy filling
the partly emptied cups

   kind o leary about tiger-tail sidin
said the conductor coming up from the tele-
graph-office and laying his hand on dans
shoulder  cant get the operator

  whats that and dans face was a
study as he straightened up  cant get
joe tam somethings dropped out take
it from me 

  no been tryin a half hour dont
answer guess the kids asleep at the bend
asleep roared dan as he whirled
about his face set cut that it aint
so i got joe his job knowin he was
right an ill stand for him personal dye
understand does the old man know

    hes up at the key now was the re-
sponse  says liell fire him soon as he gits
him on the wire in the morning the wires
working all right he just dont answer
well just put it on your book that he
wont-not for that dan retorted with
feeling  that storm that rolled through
here before we got in has been jugglin the
wires to the west youll find-and thatll
be the answer

    thomas and the superintendent stood
beside them  hold her easy down through
the paw trees reported blown over the
track a couple of miles out hand-car crew
sent out long enough ago to have cleared
away by this time but keep her in control
ready to stop sharp unless you get the all-
at tiger-tail siding



right from the section-men and then cut
her loose

    all right mr daniels and dan lifted
his torch to read the yellow flimsy handed
him no stops from here in ok
not for anything less than an open
switch a wash-out or a land-slide thom-
as and daniels was about to make a
sprint for his car when he turned   that
cub down at tiger-tail is off the job to-
night watch your lights when you pick
up the bend therell be a vacancy down
there in the morning and he was off

    in which case therell be two on this
line muttered dan as he swung for the
gangway

   for a mile or more dan had her pulling
hard then as he headed into the stretch
where trouble was reported he closed the
flow of steam to a thread and laid his hand
on the air his eye sharp ahead to catch the
first show of a light

   rounding a curve he suddenly cut on
the air opened the sand turned her over
and give her the big hole the lights ahead
were swinging across the track

   stopping close to the debris on the line
dan jumped from his cab and ran forward
uttering scathing commentaries on the slow
work of the section-men there was hard-
gained time slipping into the gap again
with small chance now of regaining it
wake up you sleepin coyotes yelled
dan as he laid hold with his own hands
and began tearing at the mat of brush and
mass of boulders and tangle of tree-limbs

    give a lift here on this rock dick
and they were rolling off a boulder that had
i teen dislodged by the upheaved roots of a
fallen tree

   were mighty lucky were not going the
other way he called  itll take a couple
hours work to clear that inner track but i
guess the section-gang will be able to let us
through in less than half an hour

   at the foot of one of the telegraph-poles
ljeside the track he caught sight of the emer-
gency-operator adjusting his instrument to
send out daniels order for the wrecking
outfit at hanford to hurry to the scene of
the slide dan waited until he had finished
the message and was about to climb the pole
to disconnect his wires and then stepped
forward

   wait a minute he said id like to
raise tiger-tail sidin joe is a friend of
mine and i think lies in trouble 

    all right said the operator  i must
     r r

report to daniels but ill be back in a few
minutes heres the climbing-irons

   left to himself dan went up the pole
made the proper connections and descend-
ing jerked open the key and hurriedly sent
joes call out over the wire he felt sure that
it would be ticked off in the little station at
the siding if the wires were working proper-
ly but as yet there was no answer he re-
peated the call but there was no response
save a few disjointed clicks of the sounder
again and again he called but still no an-
swer only more spasmodic clicks

    somethings surely wrong he muttered
 they couldnt raise him at cold springs
and here i cant get him either guess ill
have to give it up

   once more he sent the call and thn the
sounder began to again move slowly up and
down its dots and dashes came like the
working of a crippled wire but gradually
they took on a semblance of morse

   only the sound of the workmen clearing
away the debris and the throb of the engine
broke the silence as dan knelt by the little
instrument on the rocks intently listening
all attention with his face gradually taking
on a surprised look of understanding

  its mighty piece-meal sendin he
whispered to himself and ill bet theres
not an operator on the line that can make
it out but i guess ive picked it up straight
enough and the signature dont leave any
doubt of whos puttin it on the wire
whats up thomas daniels shouted
down from the tracks

   not over sure myself yet only think
theres a sleeper awake thats all and
there was a trace of irony in dans reply

   with the outfit slung over his shoulder
lie had soon made another ascent of the pole
with the experience and the agility of a
younger man

    this is takin a right smart flier in the
prerogatives of railroadin-rules i reckon
he said to himself as he groped among the
wires  and the super on the job at that
but im goin to play this hand alone and
well see if joe and i cant show him that
theres two of us awake on this line any-
way well know leastwise when we strike
the bend at the sidin

   in almost no time he had found a through
wire and the click of the instrument came
down to those below as he opened the key
and begun calling the office at the western
end of the division a town about five miles
beyond tiger-tail siding


the railroad mans magazine

 when the answer came he started his
sending sharp and fast increasing in his
nervous excitement until he made the key
fairly hum he was in a fretful hurry to
get away and deeply anxious too over the
result of his message twice the operator
broke in on him he was so beyond his speed

  as he closed the key he called to the fire-
man  stand by dick and take this out-
fit we ought to be pulling out of here in a
couple of minutes

  as the released air wheezed out 
picked up her train with a savage jerk and

he repeated the call but there
was no response

  the nervous strain on the engineer in
racing against the schedule at a terrific pace
with a heavy train over a road-bed handi-
capped by heavy curves was now over-
shadowed on dans face with an unspoken
something that made him look haggard in
the dim light of the cab

  she was reeling off mile after mile now
lurching and swaying and swinging as she

was away on the home-stretch with her
safety humming and every pound pulling
on the draw-bars the heavy grade helping
her to quickly catch her topmost speed

  keep a shakin that box an meltin the
coal dick burn her insides out if you
have to for im goin to cut off the corners
from here in and dan began playing
every advantage for an extra-fast turn of the
wheels fort miles to go and a better
track hed do it if  had it in her

pounded the rails sidewise on the crooked
trail

  ten miles fifteen-dan began nervously
pulling his watch eighteen miles nineteen
-they flashed by the lights of a little town
setting in the gloom of a hillside-twenty
miles dan held the watch in his hand
now he was calculating the time for every
move at the junction and the running-time
to the siding another mile and still
another and-dan straightened in his seat
at tiger-tail siding

as a man from whose shoulders a heavy
burden had been lifted he replaced the
watch in his pocket if the thing was ac-
cording to his understanding and they had
acted promptly it must be over by now
the lines on his face disappeared the
mental strain was over

  rising from his seat he removed the
cloth-wrapped bundle from the box

   hey dick  he yelled holding out the
package i dont think therell be any
letter to pick up from joe to-night but you
can throw that for him at the sidin i
callate hell need a right smart of that
black tobacco to steady up his nerves

   down through the pass and on to the ap-
proach of the tiger-tail bend  rolled
with undiminished speed although dan
reached forward and placed a hand on the
air as he peered ahead for the lights of the
siding then as he rounded the bend he
straightened again

  ahead there appeared the headlight of
an engine on the spur many lights were
swinging all clear and  bolted through
with a deafening roar and a blinding whirl
of lights and smoke and cinders safe on her

way to the end of her run and a regained
schedule

  there was much talk along the line of
how dan thomas the veteran engineer and
one time telegrapher had preempted the pre-
rogative of the despatches by ordering out
a special and posse from the junction-yards
to rout a band of train-robbers and clear
the switches before  swung through
trailing the crack limited of the road in her
wake

   the superintendent first learned of what
had really happened when he alighted from
his car at the junction with a bound he
was off to find the engineer

  dan thomas youre a brick he ex-
claimed as he placed both hands on the old
veterans shoulders and looked him square-
ly in the face  you outgeneraled me
thomas ill admit but i wont hold that
against you for i take it you were playing
even for what i said about that cub at the
siding being asleep-and you won

    oh by the way thomas and daniels
stopped as he turned to go im going to
take that  cub  back to headquarters with
me i need him

high-speed development

it is not a matter of very great difficulty to trace
why the railroads of other countries have
further progressed in making minutes equal miles
than what has been accomplished here the de-
velopment which the high-speed locomotive has
attained abroad and particularly in england and
france is largely due to the high plane occupied
by the motive-power department in the scheme of
organization which prevails in those countries
the able men who are at the head of this par-
ticular branch of the scrvice arc free to work out
their ideas in practical form and to remain un-
trammelled by the interference which too often
here renders the mechanical department subordi-
nate to a degree far out of keeping with its real
importance

  the foreign motive-power chief is supreme in
his capacity he reports only to the board of
directors and he has large funds appropriated
annually for the sole conduct of experimental
work along the lines which might accrue to the
benefit of the service consequently a thing which
is known to be good does not have to be aban-
doned merely on account of some incipient failure
in minor details or when the costs commence to
run up without definite return on the contrary
the advantageous arrangement prevailing is such
that errors can be corrected and the entire scheme

slowly perfected until it is capable of doing better
work than the existing appliances

  the mechanical department thus endowed with
positive authority can afford to spend the money
in the necessary education of the men who will
handle any new type of power which it may have
evolved in france through an admirable sys-
tem of premiums it rewards the engineers and
firemen for good work as it just as effectively
through a system of fines punishes them for any
dereliction of duty the principal effort how-
ever is to imbue these men with the spirit of
hearty co-operation and the success of this laud-
able endeavor docs not fall far short in con-
stituting the real reason why the united states
has been outstripped in the speed question at
least

  they have nothing to learn from us but we
have much to learn from them in the conduct of
this particular feature and until the position as
head of the motive-power department is endowed
with the dignity and given the latitude in the
way of expenditure which should properly be
associated with it not to mention freedom from
interference that department cannot be in a
position to assume the lead in working out these
world problems-american engineer and rail-

running a british railway

by robert h rogers

while traveling through europe in the interests of the railroad mans
magazine mr rogers did not spend all his time studying the opera-
tion of continental systems after making the run from paris to calais
on the foot-plate of the wonderful de glehn locomotive told in our february
number he crossed the channel and presented his credentials to the officials of
the great common-carriers of the british isles

     he was cordially received and in a number of cases was conducted per-
sonally through the yards and shops by the railway executives themselves and
given the freedom of the engines on several well-known fast trains in this
article mr rogers gives a vivid pen-picture of the operation of a british rail-
roads mechanical department pointing out every phase of the work as com-
pared with our own way of doing things

     an american is inclined to smile when first he sees an english locomotive
with its incommodious cab and without headlight bell or pilot but as mr
rogers points out an english engine has no more use for these features than
a dog has for two tails

the london and northwestern railway great britains banner road com-
pared with an american line in engines shops
and labor conditions

    yhe london and northwestern statistics given me by frank ree its general
nfftiil railway may or not be the manager may be of interest
duilu best selection as a representa- these figures were compiled for the year
i	tive of british locomotive per-  and many items to say the least are

iformance and shop practise amazing
but i largely confined myself
to it while in great britain because with-
out a doubt it is the best-developed rail-
road for its mileage not only in england
but in the entire world

it is almost impossible to appreciate the
magnitude of the capital equipment and
operation which these  miles of road
can exhibit a mileage by the way so small
from an american view-point that the road
if in this country would scarcely be classed
as one of our great railroad systems

end would make a belt around the earth
one and one-quarter inches wide for each
of the london and northwesterns 
miles of road there is one locomotive four
freight-cars twenty-six passenger-cars and
thirty men

  a study of the perfection of detail which
must be attained to make all this possible
should be of interest to railroad men in this
country but it does not properly come with-
in the scope of this article except in rela-
tion to the operation of the mechanical de-
partment the intention herein is to tell of
how the engines are run and how they are
taken care of in the roundhouses or  run-
ning sheds features which become inter-
esting in comparison with our own procedure
in america

  what is said of the london and north-
western in this regard is of equal applica-
tion to any railroad in england where all
locomotive work is attended with pains-
taking care practically unknown in ameri-
can practise

nothing is overlooked

  i have rarely seen a british engine not
sufficiently clean for exhibition purposes
there is never a leak about the valve-stem
or piston-packing or about any of the cab-
fittings the chief mechanical engineer
made me eventually understand that such
conditions would no more be allowed to
exist than to start an engine out only work-
ing on one side

  after prolonged knocking around the
running sheds and riding on the locomo-
tives i became satisfied that this spirit was
reflected throughout the entire mechanical
department

  i would like to reciprocate the attention
bestowed on me by taking my informant

around a bit among some of our round-
houses and he would note features of neglect
which he would find hard-to reconcile with
the capital invested this is one-half at
least in explanation of the care which they
take of their equipment over there to
them it is money and it is practically
handled as such

  notwithstanding the cheaper labor and
material which prevail in england en-
gines cost as much to build as they do in
this country the workmanship is generally
superior and they are built to last

  although the london and northwestern
through changes in motive-power adminis-
tration and ideas has  scrapped  more
engines in the past few years than any road
in england they were still able to show me
engines in every-day service over thirty
years old in this country the rapid suc-
cession of new designs renders power prac-
tically obsolete for main-line requirements
in at least ten years

the largest railroad shop

at the crewe shops of this road i found

	men employed in the locomotive de-
partment alone this plant is unique in
the amount of manufacturing done this
includes the making of boiler-plates the
rolling of rails the manufacture of steel
castings signal and interlocking apparatus
and a variety of other things used on the
road

  this great works the largest railroad
shop in the world all things considered
builds all the new engines required for the
london and northwestern and in addition
turns out about seventy new engines a year
for renewals the painting of the new en-
gines is so thoroughly and beautifully done
that it becomes really the work of artists
instead of painters it requires all of two
weeks but does not have to be repeated for
six years fifteen months is the usual pe-
riod between general repairs

  the men in the large repair-shops in
england are a comfortable lot they take
life easily and impress the visitor as not
intending to work too hard in fact in go-
ing about the shops the men seem to be in-
clined to make the work last as long as
possible this may be readily explained
however by the fact that piece-work is quite
common in england and whenever the men
make one and one-third times their day-
rate the price per job is reduced


the railroad mans magazine

  this readily explains the navy-yard
pace of the shopmen their speed limit
is set by the employers and it is little won-
der that repairs are extravagantly expensive

  english foremen are officials with con-
siderable dignity i met several among
them who were technical-school graduates
the workmen hold them in apparent awe
which is in marked contrast with the de-
mocracy and freedom so characteristic of an
american railroad shop the foreman in
that country is not  bill  fred  char-
ley or dick he is mr so-and-so
and you mustnt forget to touch your cap
either

  the  works manager  of an english
road is what he ought to be-a real official
with his duties confined to the shops them-
selves english roads do not have the
counterpart of our master mechanics with
responsibilities of various kinds over shops
roundhouses engineers and firemen wreck-
ing-crews and what not with far too little
help and obliged to place dependence on
their general foreman for the important
shops

  it will not be very long before the crewe
works will turn out its five thousandth new
engine every effort is being made to have
this coincident with the coronation of king
george v in view of the fact that 
minus  the present number of loco-
motives operated leaves  to be ac-
counted for which have lived their day on
the northwestern

keeping a fund

  an admirable provision is made for the
maintenance of rolling-stock on english
roads generally by setting aside each year
a definite amount to be spent for this work
this amount is increased from time to time
with the increase in the amount and ca-
pacity of the equipment and it practically
forms a depreciation fund for keeping the
rolling-stock up to a uniform condition of
efficiency

  it might be unfair if i said that the
crewe shops are the best operated in eng-
land but i certainly thought them to be the
most interesting because there is practically
nothing used by the railroad which is not
made there the nearest counterpart in
such extensive scope in this country can only
be found on the philadelphia and read-
ing railway whose reading shops manu-
facture everything from pressed steel car-

shapes to locomotive boiler-tubes this
shop has not purchased anything for repair
purposes in more than three years

  notwithstanding the appeal of the crewe
shops to a railroad man i was principally
attracted by the roundhouse end of the pro-
cedure these running sheds as they
are called are all under the direction of the
running superintendent their conduct
is entirely apart from the supervision ex-
tended over the general repair and build-
ing-shops such as crewe represents

  the great westerns family tree

  in this connection the organization-plan
of a running department may be of special
interest

   chargemen  are equivalent to foremen
fitters are machinists boilersmiths
are boilermakers and  chargemen shed-
men are simply roundhouse labor-gang
foremen tubers are the men who calk
leaky flues and  tube-runners  or  flue-
blowers  keep them clean between trips
 fire-droppers  are ash-pit men pure and
simple and bar-layers are those who
look after the maintenance of the grates
and attachments or as we call them in some
quarters gratemen

  the diagram shows very clearly who
reports to who and through it can be traced
the responsibility which leads ultimately to
the head of the running department

  upon the arrival at the  running shed
the engineer and the hostler who relieves
him make a careful examination of the en-
gine the former reports all defects before
going off duty the engine is then left near
the coal-shed in charge of the coal-shed
hostler who places it in proper position for
coaling

  all of the work reported by the engineer
and that subsequently discovered by the
 running shed  inspectors is attended to
without fail i have never known of a job
which might still run a dozen trips without
causing any trouble to be let go out with-
out receiving attention

  it may be said that when these locomo-
tives back against their trains they are in as
good shape as human watchfulness and skill
can place them

  an engineer need feel no uneasiness under
these enviable conditions in the month of
may  there were but two passenger-
engine failures on the entire london and
northwestern system
running a british railway



  after being coaled the engine is taken
by the hostler to a point beyond the coal-
shed where his helper or a boy appointed
for the purpose cleans out the smoke-box
i thought this to be a painfully slow and
cumbersome operation the smoke-boxes
should have drop-pipes through which the
sparks could be dropped without the neces-
sity of any one entering the smoke-box

  the engine then passes to the fire-track
or ash-pit where one fire-dropper stands on
the foot-plate and another in the pit a
couple of grate-bars are either pulled up
by the former or pushed up by the latter
and through the opening in the grate thus
provided the contents of the fire-box is
dropped into the ash-pan from whence it
is raked into the pit

  they dont seem to enthuse over drop or
dump-grates in that country but they ap-
peal to me as being far more sensible than
this clumsy method in which the grate-bars
have to be knocked out of place every trip
it may be added that with very few excep-
tions the fire is always drawn  arrival

  on completion of this performance the
engine is taken into the  running shed 
to be  stabled and to have the flues
cleaned out the next item in the regular
routine which is never departed from if
the shed is of the longitudinal type which
is commonly used in england with three
or four tracks running straight through it
it become necessary to have the tubes  run 
or cleaned immediately because after be-
ing placed in position another engine may
be put in front of it rendering the operation
of tube-cleaning impracticable if how-
ever the shed is round similar to our round-
houses the operation may be performed at
a time convenient to the  tube-runners

furbishing up a locomotive

  to clean a set of flues requires from forty
to sixty minutes i was much amused to
note that the flue-cleaner used the primitive
arrangement of a long rod with a piece of
canvas threaded into the end i did not
see flues cleaned by compressed-air any-
where in england although at paddington
on the great western i did locate a system
of blowing them by steam the latter being
furnished from a small vertical boiler

  next in order comes the wiping or clean-
ing of the engine in the majority of eng-
lish roundhouses each cleaner follows his
own engine and gang-cleaning such as

is universally followed in this country is not
popular needless to add that this work is
performed witli scrupulous care

  when ready for business those engines
are things of beauty beyond dispute not
a single part is missed in the wiping in-
cluding the brake-levers under the tender
and even the bottom of the ash-pan this
is one of the time-honored institutions also
and they would no more think of slighting
it than they would the work

  after wiping comes the bar-laying
in which operation the grates previously
knocked out to dump the fire are replaced
this is done either by a long pair of tongs
from the outside or by a boy who goes into
the fire-box and who after putting them
into place rakes off the accumulation of
ashes from the top of the brick arch

  the lighter-up then throws a few
shovels of coal around the fire-box and one
or two scoops of fire in the center and the
locomotive is again ready for business qf
course there may be running repairs such
as reducing brasses applying packing and
what not which may further delay the en-
gine several hours but what has been out-
lined is the inevitable procedure in connec-
tion with every engine which appears on the
coal-shed track after all is finally com-
pleted it is set outside to make house-room
exactly as in our own practise

some amazing wages

  labor is very poorly compensated in
english railroad shops even when the
cheaper possibility of living is taken under
consideration skilled boilermakers and
machinists receive wages which in ameri-
can money would amount to  for a
days work of maybe twelve hours if it hap-
pens to be a  running shed  in which they
are working and other occupations are not
nearly so well paid in many instances
engineers hauling the fastest express-trains
do not receive over two dollars for a round-
trip run lasting all day

  on one occasion i came down from glas-
gow to carlisle on the engine of the london
west coast express which is operated be-
tween the two cities jointly by the cale-
donian and the london and northwestern
railways this was a non-stop round-
trip run from glasgow to carlisle which
are  miles apart the engine left glas-
gow at  am and returned about  pm
all the engineer received for that round-


the railroad mans magazine

trip was eight shillings or  and his
fireman s d or 

  imagine a man in this country running
a limited express-train  miles for 
on many of our roads such a run would
pay the engineer  while the fireman
probably gets 

  when that british engineer asked me
what a corresponding run would pay in my
own country i didnt have the heart to tell
him the truth

  another thing it is well to bear in mind
that engineers over there as well as here
are about the highest-paid skilled labor on
the railroad if the above may be taken as
an average for their pay and i believe it
may as i made many inquiries along that
line what of the minor occupations about
the running sheds the tube-runners
 bar-layers  lighters-up and so on

  i do not believe that for unskilled labor
that is labor without a trade behind it the
average pay is more than s or ninety-six
cents per day

  in  running sheds where piece-work is
in vogue for wiping engines blowing flues
and other work which is going on all the
time it is of course possible to make more
than this but not a great deal more i
mentioned in the beginning of this article
what happens to the piece-work rate as soon
as it becomes evident that big wages are
being earned

  engineers seem to be well content with
their pay and with their position i have
been in many of their homes and they ap-
pear to live comfortably and enjoy life when
off duty but i cant understand how they
do it the current story on this side of the
water that money will go three times as far
in england is a fallacy

divided into classes

  it is difficult to get the commonest kind
of a meal for eighteen cents one fairly
decent is thirty-six cents and a good one
sixty cents i imagine that if a railroad
man is caught away from home he buys the
eighteen-cent kind or goes without because
he could not afford many of the others

  these men should have more money they
are divided into classes and they are years
and years working up to a place in the first
class at the head of the fast express-trains

  the through-freights or  goods  trains
are worked by second-class men and most
of the long runs are what is called  double

home although instead of doubling back
which might be inferred from the designa-
tion exactly the reverse is the case

  for instance on the great western rail-
way a train from swindon to exeter is
worked through to its destination and the
crew takes rest at exeter returning to swin-
don the next day on the balancing train
the effect of this arrangement is that an
engineer and fireman must be away from
their home terminal at least three nights in
a week and must necessarily pay board un-
less bunk-rooms are provided by the com-
pany and i saw very few of them on eng-
lish railroads

  the local freights are worked by third-
class men and are almost invariably  single
home jobs-that is the men take rest at
their home station switch-engines are
worked by the lowest grade of engineers
known as turners or pilotmen

climbing the ladder

  in addition to switching this grade does
most of the relief work although at some
stations where the relief-men have to fre-
quently do long-distance work third-class
men are employed relief work is of course
most irregular and is provided for the pur-
pose of keeping the hours of the trainmen
within reasonable limits when trains are
running late owing to fog congested state
of the road or other causes

  it struck me as being a long trip from a
firemans berth to that of a first-class en-
gineer the firemen generally rise from
engine-cleaners and pass through all of
the grades enumerated above before getting
hold of the throttle of a switch-engine on
some of the roads the men firing the im-
portant trains are runners themselves who
have been tempted to give up hauling a
freight-train for the shorter passenger hours
even though the pay is less for firing than
for running

  the actual running skill required to get
the fast british trains over the road on time
did not impress me as being nearly so great
as that of the men who handled the de
glehn compounds hauling the paris-ca-
lais boat-train on the french northern rail-
way in the first place the locomotives are
in perfect trim when delivered by the  run-
ning sheds the road-bed is perfection and
the block-signaling system is the finest in
the world

in the majority of instances the engines
running a british railway



are of the two-cylinder simple-expansion
type exactly as they are here although a
great many of them are built with their
cylinders inside the frames and driving
a cranked main-axle instead of being out-
side and driving the wheel through a crank-
pin compound engines are no longer popu-
lar in england and since the retirement of
the late mr webb from the london and
northwestern railway they have practi-
cally disappeared from that system

   consequently in the cab there is no be-
wildering complexity of detail of which i
told you in connection with that wonderful
de glehn engine and which almost re-
quires a specially made man to get out of
it what it can give

  these english cab interiors are quite
simple although of course somewhat dif-
ferently arranged than ours in accordance
with varying practise the basic features are
the same and you would have little trouble
in identifying them after a little study
they are generally arranged to be handled
from the left side

   the throttle or  regulator shoves down
in opening instead of pulling out and the
reverse-gear generally - operates through a
screw-wheel if the reverse-lever is used
it has some supplementary device to assist
in throwing it over they think that the
 johnson bar  in our practise is too strenu-
ous a detail to cope with and in many in-
stances which i can recall i dont know but
that they are right

   english locomotives are not disfigured
on the outside by pipes as ours are as they
have their injectors and check-valves on the
back-head of the boiler in the cab they
also use sight-feed lubricators air-sanders
and are about equally divided between the
westinghouse automatic and the eames
vacuum brake they do not have bells
head-lights or pilots such devices being en-
tirely superfluous in view of the fact that
nothing can by any possibility get through
the thick edges which line the track on
either side

in the cab of the northern mail

  i rode on the engine of the midnight
northern mail from the gloomy euston sta-
tion in london to crewe and i also rode
that of the famous west coast scotch ex-
press but i believe the former was the most
interesting experience the train consisted
of thirteen mail vans the contents of

which must be in glasgow and edinburgh
by late breakfast time and those two cities
are  miles away

  when we finally got under way with much
discordant clanking of safety-chains and
banging over switch-points i knew enough
about railroading to appreciate that this
engine had a job cut out for her if she was
to get that three hundred tons of weight be-
hind her over the  miles to crewe in only
three hours

  it was dark as erubus as we slipped
through the interminable suburbs of the
city of appalling vastness there was
no moon and as the worthy and prosperous
merchants who reside thereabouts retire
early few lights other than the signal-
system illuminated our path nevertheless
this energetic precursor plunged valiantly
into the gloom and with every revolution
of her big seventy-eight-inch drivers settled
down to a more businesslike stride

  in less than twenty miles however i was
completely disillusioned in regard to the
oft-claimed easy-riding qualities of engines
in the land of beef and ale this one cut
the most remarkable capers of any on which
i have ever ridden sometimes she would
lurch to the right and instead of recover-
ing herself promptly would apparently tear
off about three miles before again assuming
an even keel and then the performance
would be repeated on the left side oc-
casionally this would be varied by an up
and down or rocking-horse effect which
created the impression that she was trying
to climb over something

not an easy rider

  finally during a pleasing interval where
we appeared to skim easily through space
with no rail-contact whatever i ventured
to inquire of the principal gentleman in
charge the cause of such extraordinary gy-
rations

   she hasnt got enough behind to hold
her down sir he answered that
blawsted mail in the vans dont weigh much
ye know and she hasnt got enough to hold
her steady shell cut up worse than that
going through ampton eath sir

  i suppose we went through ampton
eath but i didnt see it there was no
seat on the firemans side of the cab which
i was occupying and in trying to avoid
interfering with him dodging hot injector-
pipes and striving to keep from falling off


the railroad mans magazine

altogether in the presence of that peculiar
jump-effect kept me in a perpetual dance
which would easily have put the efforts of
the moki indians to shame

  finally the driver beckoned me to cross
to his side and indicated a nook wherein
i might stow myself behind the little shelf
on which lie sat several times subsequent-
ly  the run i might add i was constrained
to throw both arms around that ample
british waist in the manner of the lady who
became the bride of young lochinvar but
matters finally adjusted themselves

  we stopped at rugby and took on five
more mail-cars and after that she steadied
down considerably the lack of weight in
the train may have had something to do
with that weird motion but i am rather
inclined to the opinion that it largely re-
sulted from the absence of equalizers on the
engine they believe in hanging their clri-
ving-springs independently of one another
a foolish practise which if it were not for
the absolutely perfect track would prevent
any one from living on the foot-plate of the
engine when at high speed

  the run into crewe was a wild dash of
about sixty miles in sixty-five minutes on
that liome-stretch this thoroughly efficient
engine afforded a grand exhibition of what
machinery will do when it is right the ad-
ditional cars taken on at rugby did not oc-
casion her the slightest discomfort there
were times when the speed reached easily
seventy-five miles per hour an exhilarating
pace through the soft air of that english
summer night

  never once did the pointer on the steain-
gage vary five pounds from london to the
end of the run and she burned a surpris-
ingly small amount of coal one injector
working constantly but throttled about half
way down on water kept the boiler fully
supplied the engineer watched this feature
with unusual care and was very clever in
maintaining the water in the glass to practi-
cally the same level from start to finish

  with this exception there was nothing
unusual in his work because these clever
engines do not require unusual ability to
keep them moving the experience of that
trip brought it home to me conclusively that
english locomotive designers aim at a ma-
chine which will produce results when
operated with a minimum of intelligence

  this is exactly the opposite of the ideas
prevailing across the channel where al-
though they put the stuff in the engine

the engineer has to certainly work his points
to get it out

  maybe the english plan is the best after
all despite my enthusiastic endorsement of
the de glehn compound in a preceding
article at high-speed the engineer is fully
occupied in watching the signals and the
water probably it would be just as well
not to bother him with the control of in-
dependent cut-off gears variable exhausts
receiver-control valves and what not

  i noticed particulauly that this english
engineer never took his eyes off the road
for a moment not even when replying to
the few brief questions which i asked him
whereas my friend in france was so con-
stantly occupied with adjustments and re-
adjustments of his controlling-gear that he
scarcely saw where he was going

  the men in the cab on this mail-run
called every signal to one another in a dis-
tinct tone the engineer would indicate
the color and the fireman would affirm it
or vice versa going into crewe where there
is an intricate interlocking system the fire-
man gave his undivided attention to the
various semaphores designating them by
letters

  all right on r all right on x
and so on went their calls it was quite
evident that they were carefully trained to
keep a good lookout at all times a feature
which has unfortunately not been well de-
veloped on french railroads

  the heavy thinking is done by very few
men and they are enormously compensated
f m webb chief mechanical engineer or
locomotive superintendent of the north-
western received for a salary  or
 per year they are willing to pay
well a man who can think for his entire
department

  it is practically unknown for a subordi-
nate official not to mention the vast rank
and file to take the initiative the features
of personality and individuality which en-
dow american railroading with such a pic-
turesque aspect are entirely lacking in great
britain because the men through the abso-
lutely inflexible system of organization must
be largely automatons

  the general scheme is also a wonderful
example of absolute subordination a sub-
ordination so complete that individual ef-
fort is seriously hindered if not altogether
checked the men are not naturally self-
assertive as in this country and could not
be in the face of the prevailing systems
baldy knoxs premonition

by jap kubovec

            an eagle-eyes warning foretold a wreck
            but gave no hint of a real love affair

w co ie scrapple sue a
 h  railroad  snorted baldy
knox engineer of the 

bpi gm wt tran  ve hurs

i aiii late as usual as he leaned
out the cab-window and
sourly watched brooks the head brakeman
line up the switch and give him a sign to
pull in on the siding

  now we go into the hole here for that
special which also means that well prob-
ably be stuck for no  he growled jerk-
ing open the throttle with a few more select
railroad expressions while the  picked
up the slack and slowly dragged the long
heavy train in on the siding leaving the
main line clear for the coming train

  baldy finished oiling around and was
soon back on his seat-box

 i had a premonition that something

like this was due to happen just because i
wanted to be home early to-day he ex-
plained to brooks who was standing in the
gangway

   here i was aiming to attend the auc-
tion and buy those two lots adjoining mine
and now i lose the chance to make a good
investment with the few dollars ive sweat-
ed and slaved for on this pike

   that sure is hard luck admitted
brooks  i know the lots they are a
good buy but say why dont you wire
the wife to go and put in a bid for you
she knows what you intend to pay for them
and might get them as cheap as you could

   i can see there is no hope for a man
like you who never reads the funny papers
brooks laughed baldy  did you or any
one else ever hear of a woman going to an
auction and buying anything without pay-


the railroad mans magazine

ing at least three times what it was worth
my wife is one of the finest women in the
world but she has as much right around
an auction as youd have around a sunday-
school

  but speaking of premonitions did
either one of you ever have a feeling that
something was going to happen while you
were out on the road and then find that
it really did asked baldy reaching over
and lighting his pipe at the gage lamp

  no well as long as were stuck here
for no  and have half an hour to spare
if you fellows will listen ill tell you
about one i had many years ago that
changed the whole course of my life

  baldy paused and looked around to see
that his audience were in comfortable posi-
tions and not apt to interrupt his remarks

   i was just past my twenty-second birth-
day and had a good job pulling freight out
in the northwest when i first meets kate
it was at a saturday-night social up at
easton in the main hotel there

  the place was crowded and i was
looking around for some one to dance with
when fatty simmons waddled by with a
fine looking girl the next time they came
by i grabbed fatty and told him he re-
minded me of a circus where i had seen an
elephant and a shetland pony doing a waltz
together but some rube way - billed as a
fioor-manager butted in and told me to shut
up or get out

   i never had any too much beauty and
he was a good deal bigger fellow than i
was so i shut up like a clam but i kept
my eyes on the young lady and in about
an hour i braced fatty and asked him to
introduce me to his friend he did it all
right and in a nice neighborly way but
she backed and filled like this old hog does
when she tries to pull a double train

   seemed to me as though she wasnt stuck
much on meeting me or any of my friends
from the way she talked but i used plenty
of sand and stuck right with her until she
gave up in disgust and tried to see if she
couldnt drive me away with sarcastic re-
marks finally however she turned real
friendly and ended by inviting me to call
and see her at the hotel where she worked
for her uncle

  faint heart never won fair lady was
my reasoning so i borrowed some money
from fatty and stayed over to accept the
invitation the next day before she was
troubled with a touch of forgetfulness

    she was the one that held the switch-
 list in the lunch-counter department and it
 worried me when i saw how she made the
 -rest of the girls get busy for even then i
 was ready to ask her to be mrs leonadis
 knox though i wanted to hold the switch-
 list and do some of the ordering around
 myself

     i sat up on a stool and ate pigs feet
 at a nickel a throw until my money was
 gone and i had to walk three miles to
 settle my stomach

     when i got back to ruckett my troubles
 commenced i had missed my turn  out
 and the  old man  gave me an awful call-
 ing down for not being on hand and for
 not reporting a lot of work on the old bunch
 of scrap i was coaxing over the road at that
 time then when i did report work the
 crowd in the roundhouse overlooked it and
 i had engine failures almost ever day

    i- dreamed of kate by night and i
 thought of her by day while my fireman
 cussed and swore as he tried to fire and
 watch both sides for signals the train-
 men got into a habit of throwing rocks and
 chunks of coal against the side of the cab
 and some of them got fresh and slammed
 me with their wireless signals instead of
 the engine

   matters went from bad to worse and
 the old man called me in on the carpet and
 politely but sarcastically informed me that
 i would either have to get over my crazy
 spell and marry or look for a new job

      im perfectly willing to be tied up for
 keeps says i to him  but the young lady
 appears to be deaf dumb and blind when-
 ever i try to tell her about the new schedule
 i want to map out for her

      youre dippy in the dome- insinuated
 the old man who was a whole lot married
 himself if we could judge by the reception
 he received at home after a late session with
 the gang  a woman would sooner sit and
 listen to that kind of foolishness than to go
 to a swell cafe with a millionaire and eat
 shrimp salad and ice-cream

     it is always darkest just before dawn
 according to some book of- rules and i
 guess its right for i had made at least ten
 trips to easton without telling my tale of wo
 when one day kate told me that she was
 going down to woodland for a months visit
 to some friends woodland was at the other
 end of the division and i would have plen-
 ty of time to see her for i laid over there
 every third day
baldy knoxs premonition



   i put in all my spare time and a lot of
the companys planning where and how id
pop the question and what id say but the
month passed before i knew it and i
stopped in on the last day of kates visit
determined to do or die it makes me swear
when i think of it i hadnt been there five
minutes when the call-boy comes up and
calls me for an  extra soon as ready

   of course i had to go kate walked
out to the gate with me while conversa-
tionally i slipped and slid around like an
engine trying to pull through an inch of

  from then on i attended strictly to rail-
roading and we pulled into oakland just
in time to run into one of those wind and
rain storms that-hit that part of the country
as regular as clockwork and do their level
best to wash out the road-bed and throw
trees and telegraph-poles across the track

   as we were coming through the upper
end of town i suddenly caught sight of
somebody out on the track with a lantern
swinging us down like a windmill think-
ing that the rails were blocked i shot on
the air and stopped but when the fireman

some rube way-billed as
a floor-manager
butted in

soft soap while she stood there with a teas-
ing smile and informed me that she intend-
ed to go up into canada soon and keep
house for a brother who was lonesome and
needed her badly i wanted to tell her
that i needed her more than all the brothers
in the world but my tongue failed

   never could remember how i told her
good-by or how i reached the roundhouse
we pulled out of town all right but the
first idea  got that we were not making
regular time was about six miles down the
road when seward the conductor comes
over the top of the train and asks me to
open her up a little so that a farmer back
in the caboose can get to ruckett before his
car-load of eggs hatches out

seward and i got down and went ahead
we did some tall cussing a rube whose
hen-house had been blown over by the gale
had stopped us to keep the train from kill-
ing some of his chickens which were out on
the right-of-way running in all directions

   we were some mad i can tell you and
we gave that fellow a tongue lashing he
probably remembered for some time

  the wires were down in jig time and
the time-card badly twisted we waited over
an hour until no  which was following
us pulled in and then the wire on the east
end came to life and we got orders to run
as second no  to ruckett

   first  had orders to meet no  at
auburn forty miles west of oakland but


the railroad mans magazine

thought he would and muttered

 oh pshaw baldy i know you can
make the time but a feeling has hold
of me that i cant seem to shake off
somewhere up that pike and he
pointed up the track with a scared
look on his face  i can see some kind
of a mix and the thoughts of it are
worrying me more than i can tell
you and shaking his head slowly he
walked back toward the caboose

  first no  pulled out and went
kiting up the road with stover the
engineer shaking his fist at me i
didnt blame him much palmer was
down in a sag where he always let em
ramble to make time in getting to the
top of the hill and slowing down to
let our flagman off would make him
lose a few minutes more we fol-
lowed em right out and the excite-
ment of getting started after stover
knocked the nervous feeling out of me
until we were a few miles up the road

   the road from oakland to ruck-
ett was about the cussedest and crook-
edest line that any half-witted sur-
veyor ever laid out about sixty miles
on an air-line id call it while the
rails run for over ninety miles through
the roughest kind of country

   up a hill and down the other side
all the way with the caboose still coming
down one side while the engine was poking
her nose up the next one following up
and down the teeth of a saw is about the
nearest description i can think of

  lake was the first station out of oak-
land where a night office could be found
and the thought of trouble worried me so
that i began to hope the wires would be
working by the time we reached there and
tile operator would have the red light
against us i eased off on the throttle
when we hit the lower end of town and only
too willing to stop but the green light was
shining bravely in the semaphore over the
little shanty i whistled twice for the board
hoping to scare the operator into thinking
he had made a mistake but the green still
loomed up like a headlight and the oper-
ator only gave me a contemptuous stare as
we passed

   right out of lake we hit a sleep down-
grade and in all of my thirty years of life
on an engine ive never had a stronger no-
tion of quitting than i did right then and
there whether it was my morbid thoughts

no mention was made of us on account of
the order being put out before the wires
went down seward ordered the hind
brakeman to go out on first no  and hold
no  at palmer eight miles east of au-
burn in case we couldnt make the time

   i had seen all kinds of flagging in my
six years of railroading at that time but
when seward went back after the brake-
man something sent a shiver of doubt over
me i knew it was the proper thing to do
but cold clammy chills kept chasing up
and down my back

   the fireman on the passenger was put-
ting out his green flags and lighting his
markers and i was busy lighting the head-
light when seward came back to the en-
gine and told me to hike right out after
them and do the best i could he stood
gazing off up the track and i could see
something was worrying him too

  whats eating you seward i blus-
tered in an attempt to get rid of my nerv-
ous feeling  dont vou think we will be
able to make the time 

  seward rose to the bait just as i
baldy knoxs premonition



or not i dont know but somewhere in the
misty road ahead i could see a mixed-up
jumble of cars and an engine toppled off to
one side

   i could see people moving around and
the steam arising from the wrecked engine
just as plain as i could see the front end
of the engine i was on every little fea-
ture was so distinct that i almost fell out
the cab-window as i felt myself leaning
forward to peer around the end of a car
to catch the number of the engine

   i pulled myself together with a few
choice remarks to myself that explained
how many different kinds of a fool i was
the next curve we hit i looked back as
usual to see if we had all the train and
was just in time to see a fusee thrown off
the caboose

   that settled it it was easy enough to
see that the fireman was scared stiff - i
could hardly get him to stay in the cab at
all-i knew i was so rattled that i wanted
to get off the engine and throw up the job-
the bunch back on the caboose were troubled
with softening of the brain similar to my
complaint or they wouldnt be tossing off
fusees for a stop still six miles away i
was still studying the matter over when we
spotted a faint light just as
we hit a straight stretch of
track about three miles
from palmer at first i
thought it was the embers
of a burning tree but i
wasnt taking any chances
that night so i slammed on
the air and pinches em
down to five miles an hour
or less

  the fireman and i were
watching the light

    when it c h a n g e d to
green we both gave a yell

i stopped the string with a
jerk and whistled out a
flag i looked back and
saw the flagman going back
and seward coming up to-
ward the engine

   i watched the light
flicker as it came slowly up
the track and i might as
well tell the truth and say
i was a whole lot scared

im not naturally a coward
but things were a whole
lot mixed up that night

i ran forward

and i wasnt sure of anything but the fact
that every lunkhead on the train myself
included was expecting something unusual
to happen whatever it was it looked to
me as though it was right on schedule time
and coming up the track to meet us the
fireman was down on the step with a torch
held over his head sewards lantern could
be seen bobbing along over the train and
the hind man was hiking back up the track
with his red light that was the only time
in my life that i ever envied a brakeman
his job

   seward came up and asked the fireman
what the trouble was and i could hear his
snort of surprise when he looked up the
track i crawled down where they were
and we went into an excited discussion as
to why and what it was seward was of the
opinion that it was my place to walk down
the track and meet it but i told him the
book of rules ordered me to stay with the
engine then we both agreed that the fire-
man should go but the fireman didnt see
it that way at all

   the light kept
coming steadily to-	

ward the engine	y  

both seward and	  i -

and caught her

we gave that fellow a tongue-lashing

the fireman began to move back toward the
train i was standing by the pilot-beam
with a hammer and monkey-wrench in my
hands i knew the tools would be no pro-
tection against a ghost-but i had to have
something to hold on to the light was
now a blur of white similar to the way a
white barn looks in a dusky twilight and
flashes of red and green light would be seen

   seward and the fireman had played tag
until they were two cars behind the engine

   a cold clammy perspiration was break-
ing out all over me and i wanted to run
back with seward but was afraid to leave
the engine i tried to lay the hammer down
on the pilot to take a chew of tobacco and
was so nervous the hammer tapped away on
the iron like the sounder in a despatchers
office

   the ghost was now just in the circle of
light thrown by the headlight i picked up
the hammer and was about to hurl it at
the specter when the spook suddenly let out
a series of cries with my name in each call
i was nervous enough before but when that
white thing began calling lonny lonny
help help  you can bet your pay-check
i was half crazy and only weakness kept
me from running then it suddenly
dawned on me that it was a woman and the
voice sounded like kates i ran forward
and caught her in my arms jut as she fell

   it was kate kate with her hair hang-
ing down her back her white dress covered
with dirt and marked with blood-stains from
gashes in her hands how she came to be
there or what the trouble was did not enter
my mind all i could think of was the
story i had tried to tell her so often and
my voice started out like a phonograph with
the regulator broken

   seward came running up and had to
grab me by the shoulder and shake hard be-
fore i could set the brakes on my tongue
but i had already received my answer in the
way that kate clung to me and sobbed out
her story after i had left she had hurried
to the station and taken first no  for
home passing us at oakland

   just outside of palmer  had hit some-
thing the crash was terrific several
trainmen had been killed and no one re-
membered to flag she had grabbed one of
the tail-lights and started back to meet us
the light had two green sides and one red
one which gave the flashes of both colors
as she changed the lamp from hand to hand
we put her in the caboose and pulled on
into palmer

   thats exactly just how i popped the
question and won my wife but why we
were all so badly scared that night is
something that ive been trying to figure
out ever since

questions
answered
for
men

describe methods of taking the port-open-
ings and squaring the valves with the young
valve-gear which is so similar to the wal-
schaert gear

	how are valves squared with the baker-
pilliod valve-gear

	suppose the valve-travel on one side of an
engine was more than on the other side how
would this affect the cut-off when the reverse-
lever was near the center of the quadrant-t

j m havre montana

	since the young valve-gear can be driven
equally well by either the walschaert or the steph-
enson motions any familiarity with the setting
of either motion will suffice in this case in order
to obtain the port-openings remove the valve-
chamber heads whereupon the valves can be plain-
ly seen the adjustment of any valve-motion so
far as mere squareness is concerned is dependent
upon the equal travel or motion nf the valve on
either side of a certain middle line which must
necessarily be the center line of the exhaust-port
therefore in the young gear simply mark the
valvc-stcm as the admission-port begins to open
just as you would with any other gear the idea
is to get marks on the valvc-stcm from which to
work and these once obtained the subsequent
procedure becomes easy

	the baker-pilliod valve-gear when prop-
erly constructed and adjusted to the locomotive
passes outside of the pale of the constant con-

 rr	

 sideration of the engineer or mechanic while
 liable of course to a certain amount of wear and
 inaccuracy it is not subject to those erratic varia-
 tions so peculiar to some forms of valve-gearing
 generally speaking the eccentric-rod is the only
 part that may occasion a renewal of adjustment as
 the wear of the bearings at the main-crank or in
 the main driving-boxes may cause a slight varia-
 tion in point of length of the eccentric-rod

   the gear reach-rod and eccentric-arm as well
 as the valve-rod are all fitted with means for ad-
 justment in regard to length so that the equaliza-
 tion of the travel of the valve can be readily ef-
 fected in the original assembling of the parts
 the amount of lead or opening of the valve at the
 beginning of the stroke can be increased or di-
 minished by lengthening or shortening the lower
 arm of the bell-crank

   it will be readily appreciated that by lengthen-
 ing the arm of the bell-crank attached to the valve-
 rod connection an increase in the length of the
 valve-stroke will be made and this increase will
 be added to the amount of valve-opening at the
 end of the piston-stroke a corresponding de-
 crease will occur in the case of shortening the
 bell-crank arm

   these organic changes are seldom required and
 it is questionable whether in the instance of a
 change in the amount of valve-opening being
 necessary it would not be advisable to make a


the railroad mans magazine

change in the combination-lever by shortening
or lengthening this lever the stroke of the valve
will be affected in a lesser degree

  in brief assuming that the design of the valve-
gearing is correct the adjustment of the parts is
a matter comparatively easy of accomplishment
and the contrivance when once adjusted has the
rare quality of retaining that degree of accuracy
which approaches as near perfection as can be
expected in the strenuous aggregation of diverse
forces which have their being in locomotive service

  we might add for your information that the
original baker-pilliod valve-gear to which your
question no doubt refers has now been consider-
ably modified and improved and many slight de-
fects in the old gear have been successfully elimi-
nated in its new form it has recently been ap-
plied to several high-speed locomotives of the
central railroad of new jersey and other roads
have spoken quite highly of it in high-speed
service

   under the conditions which you mention
the steam will follow the piston farther on the
side with the longest valve-travel irrespective of
the position of the reverse-lever except that the
discrepancy will probably be more in evidence
with the lever closer to the end of the quadrant
if the error is sufficiently great it will cause the
valves to beat very much out of square and it
should be corrected by raising the side of the
valve-motion which swings the longest that is
of course after the travel has been equalized on
both sides this adjustment may be made either
by shortening the link-hanger or by putting a liner
of proper thickness under the rocker-box of the
long side it is difficult to give any rule for the
exact amount which the hanger should be short-
ened or the rocker-box raised as they are opera-
tions in which past experience proves the best
teacher it is said that one-sixteenth alteration
in the hanger means a difference of one inch in
the cut-off but it would be better to prove it for
yourself

require unusual space we are holding nos  to

  	there are very few roads to-day on which
the block-system is not employed in one of its
varied forms - automatic controlled manual

to be least advanced of modern signaling and is
about the least in evidence among the different
systems if you are particularly interested in
what has been done and what remains to be ac-

automatic switches can be arranged at turn-out

point-rail as ordinarily arranged in these devices
is held by a housed spring in about the center of
a cross-tie at the point this spring cloges the
switch after each wheel-flange passes by the ac-

      b and others new york city-we do not
know of any concern shipping railroad
men to south america as we have often said be-
fore we cannot too strongly advise against a rail-

thoroughly with some one who has returned with
experience it is our opinion that you will then
give up the idea

give methods for obtaining degrees of curves
-b e b ralston nebraska

   the simplest way of describing a railroad curve
is by giving the length of the radius i e the
distance from the center to the outside of the
circle or one-half the diameter the shorter the
radius the sharper the curve the length of the
radius is usually stated in feet english engineers
often state the radius in chains  chain  
feet the length of the radius of a railroad
curve is measured to the center of the track

   civil engineers designate railroad curves by de-
 grees using the sign  for degrees and  for
 minutes there being  minutes in one degree
 the exact length of radius which with an angle
 of one degree has a chord of  feet is found to
 be  feet for the sake of convenience
  is generally taken as the radius of a one-
 degree curve if the angle at the point of the
  v  is two degrees and the sides are prolonged
 until  feet apart the length of each side is
 almost exactly one-half as long as when the
 angle is one degree or j of -s

  for a three-degree curve the radius is one-
third of  and so on for perfect exactness
the length of  feet should be measured not
along a straight line connecting the ends of the
 v but along the line of the circle of which the
sides of the  v are radii i c the arc should
be used and not the chord
by the light of the lantern



    the difference however is so slight for any
  curves ordinarily used on main lines of standard-
  gage railroads as to be ignored in practise for
  extremely sharp curves of say  feet radius or
  less it is usual to express the curve by feet radius
  rather than by degrees a very simple method of
  finding degree of curvature without mathematical
  calculations is to run out  feet of a steel tape
  and stretch it between two points against the in-
  side rail on the curve then measure from the
  exact center of the tape the  foot mark to the
  edge of the inside rail and this distance in inches
   represents the degree of curvature

    you will have to make our other question re-
  garding  expansion-plugs between rails more
  explicit before we can attempt an answer

how dofife a locomotive work-f e c
toledo ohio

    we cannot reply to this as briefly as you have
  propounded the question and we are somewhat
  at a loss how to answer you at all we dont
  know how much elementary knowledge you pos-
  sess in regard to a locomotive however we will
  do the best we can

    the steam-locomotive consists of a boiler and
  engine mounted on a frame which is supported
  on wheels the latter being turned by the engine
  the boiler contains water and has a fire-box
  forming part of it in which fuel is burned to
  supply heat to the water and convert ii into steam
  the steam passes through a valve called a throt-
  tle-valve thence through pipes to the steam-
  chysls from which valves operated by a con-
  nection from the main-shaft or axle automatic-
  ally admit it alternately to each end of the cyl-
  inders and exhaust it therefrom into the atmos-
  phere through the exhaust-pipe and stack

   the expansive force of the steam moves the
 pistons piston-rods and cross-heads back and
 forth and as the cross-head moves in guides and
 has one end of the main-rod connected to it at the

wrist-pin while the other end of the main-rod is
connected to the crank-pin on the driving-wheel
the reciprocating motion of the piston is thereby
changed into the rotary motion of the driving-
wheels this description could of course be elabo-
rated in detail to fill a dozen magazines the size
of this but the above may suffice to give you an
idea you might read to advantage  how a loco-
motive boiler works and  the inside history
of a locomotive which appeared in the rail-
road mans magazine september and october
 respectively

haye argued that locomotive driving-wheels
arc cast and have a steel tire and that the
freight-car wheels are made of cast iron is
this right  would like to know whether there
is any wood-fiber under locomotive-tires and if
there is a wood-fiber driver in existence-g p
new york city

  you are right in both contentions locomo-
tive driving-wheels may be of cast iron or cast
steel the latter being now in more general use
both have a steel tire which is bored somewhat
smaller than the wheel and then heated to secure
the expansion to get it on the contraction when
cold ordinarily serves to hold it but in many
cases additional safeguards are employed such as
tire-retaining rings ancl set-screws passing through
the wheel-rim between the spokes and into the
tire

  wrought-iron wheels for locomotives have been
used in england and no doubt many may be
found there yet their construction is decidedly
interesting in view of the fact that it requires
many sections welded together to form a wheel
and the completed job represents about the highest
development of the blacksmiths art freight-car
wheels in this country are always of cast iron
without tires but the tread is chilled or hardened
wood-fiber is not used as you suggest

  the baldwin locomotive works has turned out
close to  engines in a single week even then
probably the capacity of the plant was not fully
tested



has the pennsylvania railroad any engines
of the pacific type larger than the 
of the baltimore and ohio

  	which engine do you consider the speed-
iest of the two types the american -- or
the atlantic -- equal size drivers cylin-
ders etc-h c v pittsburgh

  	the baltimore and ohio engine  of
the -- or pacific type weighs  pounds
while the heaviest pennsylvania of the same type
has a total weight of  pounds the penn-
sylvania engine is also some  pounds heavier
on drivers the tractive effort of the baltimore
and ohio engine however is in excess of this
monster and under even conditions it should
prove as efficient

  f  your first pencil sketch indicates an


the railroad mans magazine

american or -- type that is a -wheel lead-
ing-truck and  connected drivers with no trailer
the addition to this wheel arrangement of a
single rear-truck behind the drivers converts the
american into the atlantic or -- type al-
though there should be very little difference if
any in speed under the equal conditions which
you mention it would be in favor of the atlantic
type as the small rear or trailing-truck permits
the fire-box to be greatly widened over the --
consequently with larger grate area and heating
surface there would be more assurance of con-
tinuous high-steam pressure which is a most im-
portant factor in the consideration of high loco-
motive speeds it might be added that the at-
lantic type is recognized as the high-speed engine
in both this and foreign countries where the load
behind the tender is in keeping with its capacity

the comparison between baltimore and ohio 
and baltimore and ohio  and  although
we have the completed dimension figures on

this writing for the  these tabular com-
parisons which you request are always very in-
teresting and it is our intention to give them in
that form whenever wanted if it will be of any
value to you however without the tabulated data
we can say there is little comparison possible
between the two engines mentioned and the big
pacific  they are atlantics -- and
are much lighter than the latter we will publish
the dimension-tablenext month and you may
draw your own conclusions you need not apolo-
gize for your interesting letters as we are glad to

nately fixed that we can soon get in touch with

how should a fire be built up in a locomotive

applied to a fire

  	if a hole appears in the fire how should
it be treated

  	state as fully as you can just when the
blower should be used

  	in making station stops should a fresh
fire be put in at shutting off or when starting

  	in approaching long down-grades how
should the fire be handled-c a j salt creek
colorado

  	the success of a trip over a division de-
pends very much on how the start is made a
fireman with an interest in his work should reach
the engine soon enough before starting-time to
have the fire in the condition most favorable to
making steam for the start a hard and fast line
cannot be recommended because the conditions
under which the start is made must influence to
a great extent the kind of fire that must be on the
grates a heavy hard-pulling train starting upon
an ascending grade through the street of a town
and long yards will call for a fire different from
that which is necessary when the train is light
and easy grades are met at the start without yards
and streets that demand the firemans attention
to signals at all events when the train is ready
to start there should be a glowing fire on the grates
of a depth sufficient to keep up steam until after
the reverse-lever has been notched back and the
train worked into speed

  	the good fireman maintains the fire in a
condition to suit die work which the engine has
to do at parts of the road where the grades
materially increase the work to be done he makes
the fire heavier to suit the circumstances this
is done gradually and not by pitching a heavy
charge into the fire-box at one time this system
of steady firing keeps the temperature of the boiler
as even as possible and has the double result of
being easy on the boiler and using the fuel to the
best advantage the fire should be maintained
nearly level and the coal supplied so that the sides
and corners of the fire-box are well filled for
there the liability to drawing air is most imminent
by the light of the lantern



with this system closefy followed here should
be no difficulty in keeping up a steady head of
steam

  	when a hole appears in the fire it should
be promptly located and filled either by throwing
lump-coal into it or by leveling the fire to cover
it it is of course apparent that the presence
of a hole concentrates the draft largely in that
quarter and has a most detrimental effect on the
combustion which should be going on uniformly
all over the grate-bars

  	the blower should be used principally to
carry off the smoke which has a tendency to trail
when the engine is shut off it can best be pre-
vented by refraining from putting in fresh coal for
a few moments before the throttle is closed other
uses for the blower will from time to time suggest
themselves to any observant fireman the blower
should not be left on any longer around stations
than is absolutely necessary in addition to the
discomfort occasioned by its noise it will blow
away considerable steam at the pops

  	when approaching a stopping-place the
fireman should be careful to have a sufficiently
heavy fire prepared as a preliminary so that he
will not have to commence firing until the start is
made if this has been neglected however it is
better to throw in a fresh supply of coal while the
engine is standing at the station the common
practise of throwing open the door and com-
mencing to fire as soon as the throttle is opened
is very hard on the fire-boxes because the cold
air drawn through the door strikes the fire-box
sheets and tubes contracting the metal and tend-
ing to produce leakages firing just as a train is
pulling out of a station is bad for another reason
at that time the fireman should be assisting the
engineer in looking out for the signals

  	it depends entirely on the conditions of
the road and run if other grades are to be sur-
mounted care must be taken that the fire does
not burn down too low for the hard pull to come
this is a point where your experience will form
a better guide than anything we can say here

          clifford tells a story and love finds
          a way to unite three happy hearts

chapter xvi
loves demands

genuine acknowledgment of
love is never lost on a sin-
cere woman elaine aldyce
felt in the innermost re-
cesses of her heart that
george clifford meant every
word that he had uttered on the deck of the
titan

  there was something in his tone and
manner that precluded any possibility of
doubt george clifford loved her of that
there was no gainsaying

  the question that rankled in her heart
was whether or not she loved him love
to her was the purest and holiest condition
that a united man and woman could know
it should exist as strong in the one as in
the other there should be no doubts the
woman should not only be sure of the man
but sure of his love

  the man should not only be the lover and
protector of the woman but know that she
has found in him the ideal of her fancy-
for it is on fancy as much as character and
will that a woman builds her love

  then too it was for life-life so far as
she would know it she recalled the words
of her dear dead mother-a woman who was
a wife and a mother in every sense of that
holy combination her mother had said
when you marry my daughter be sure
that you love-be sure that you love that
is the only basis on which a girl should
marry

  all this and a thousand and one more
thoughts flashed through elaines mind
as she tore herself from george cliffords

arms and ran like a startled deer to her
stateroom

  one or two of the belated passengers saw
her and noticed the strange look on her face
as she passed them but they simply sur-
mised another case of seasickness and an
overcome lady hastening to the confines of
her stateroom

  once inside she hastily removed her hat
and coat as the great tears welled to her
eyes and blinded them she threw herself on
her bed and wept

  for a long time her sobbing might have
been heard by any one passing her door
she seemed to be able to do naught but cry
then the tears gave way to thoughts-
thoughts and thoughts and still more
thoughts that would not down came crowd-
ing into her brain

  this was the first time in her life that a
man had proposed to her it came as a
shock to jhe girl-for her life had been lived
outside of such idea when it does come to
such a girl it is a matter of the most serious
import it affects her whole life

  sleep soon calmed the troubled girl-
sleep without dreams or qualms-and when
she awoke the stream of sunlight that illu-
mined her room made her sit up and mar-
vel she arose and looked in the glass at
her red and swollen eyes

  what a sight she said womanlike
and then she set about her toilet for she must
appear on deck soon and-oh how would
she tell may pierce

  there came a soft knock at the door

  elaine opened it cautiously a white-
capped stewardess stood outside

  miss aldyce she said mr clifford
wishes te-know if you will take breakfast
with him and miss pierce in the restaurant

began in the december  raiuoad mans magazine single copics  cents


through by sunrise



  the three fellow travelers had been ac-
customed to take their meals together in the
regular saloon and an invitation to the res-
taurant was a little out of the ordinary
many of the modern ocean liners have an
a la carte restaurant in conjunction with
the regular dining-saloon where passengers
may go at will at any hour of the day or
night

  elaine hesitated a moment she could
not quite comprehend why george clifford
should have sent such an invitation

   oh i dont think-i really dont think
that i will take breakfast this morning she
said hesitatingly  tell mr clifford that
i shall not take breakfast this morning i
will meet him and miss pierce later for
luncheon

  the stewardess departed and elaine
turned to make herself presentable but in
a little while she was interrupted by the tele-
phone in her stateroom

  she placed the receiver to her ear the
musical tone of george cliffords voice
greeted her

   do accept my invitation-elaine

  he hesitated before speaking her name

  she did not reply

   elaine he repeated lower  dont you
hear me  

    please dont she said

  wont you accept my invitation he
asked

  what for she asked-and she knew
not why she should make so foolish a re-
mark

   breakfast in the restaurant he said
 i want you to come at once

   commanding-already  she answered
as her voice broke into a ripple of laughter

  clifford would have given worlds if he
could have taken her into his arms at that
moment

   why wont the regular saloon do   she
asked

   do  said george with some emphasis
 it has been closed for an hour you must
remember that you have been sleeping over-
time to-day miss pierce and i have been
pacing the deck waiting for you if you
dont come soon ill devour the anchor-
chains im as hungry as a starved wolf

   i didnt think that i would take break-
fast this morning said the girl

  nonsense replied clifford you
must come we will wait fifteen minutes
for you meantime i will go to the steward
and order besides elaine the english

coast is on our bow and by the time that
breakfast is over it will be in splendid view
now elaine dont be foolish come as i

wish

  there was something in his voice that
seemed to assure elaine that she should go

  heretofore she had been immune to such
pleading nobody could make her do any-
thing against her wishes now she felt that
it was her desire-nay her duty-to say that
she would do what he so earnestly requested
some inner motive that had never before
manifested itself in her being seemed to be
saying yes yes yes and ere she was
aware of it she had said  yes  so clearly
and audibly that there could be no mistaking
her meaning

  good  cliffords voice had the ring of
real delight miss pierce and i will
meet you at the entrance to the main sa-
loon dont be long think of my ter-
rible hunger

  elaines fifteen minutes grew into twenty
and even thirty before she did put in an ap-
pearance

  she had dressed with lightning-like
rapidity but when the final moment came
for her to leave her stateroom and face the
man who the night before had asked her to
be his wife the strain was a little too much

  just how many times she tried to open
the door and step into the passage she could
not tell for moments she sat trying to
muster her courage she knew that george
would be calling her again-and then his
appetite she should have some considera-
tion for that

  george clifford was on the verge of start-
ing to telephone a second time when he and
may pierce chanced to glance up the wide
staircase that led down to the main saloon
they looked just in time to see elaine-a
queen in her simple stateliness-hesitating
at the top step

  clifford thought she had never looked so
glorious before she was attired in a pretty
morning gown a jaunty hat was set nat-
tily on her well-combed hair she seemed to
be the allegory of womanly perfection

  she turned her head away for a moment
and then started down the stairs then her
eyes caught those of george clifford and her
face lit up with a smile that was a radiant
beam of glory

  clifford responded with a reassuring
smile that dispelled her fears as the morning
sun dispels the shadows

  she knew that awful danger-the danger
gg

the railroad mans magazine

of meeting him face to face-was over his
smile set her at ease

  he arose and held out his hand she took
it and looked straight into his face but as
he pressed her hand with all the warmth of
heartfelt assurance she blushed just the
daintiest crimson and turned away

  miss pierce and i are starved to deadi
said clifford you wait with her a min-
ute and i will see if breakfast is ready
he darted into the restaurant the girls
were left alone for a moment keen is the
perception of woman-aye keener and more
penetrating than that of man although
clifford had not divulged to may pierce-
either by look or word or sign-even the
slightest hint of the understanding that had
arisen between elaine and him its truth
flashed into her mind

  as clifford dashed to the restaurant may
took her friends hand

   what a beautiful morning  said
elaine

  but two and two and four and four and
eight and eight had been dashing through
may pierces brain and each addition was
just what she anticipated it would be she
didnt heed the time-worn remark about the
weather but looking elaine straight in the
eye she said

  elaine-elaine-i think i know why
you are so late this morning

   why may dear-

  oh elaine may i- she drew close
to her chum and whispered with every atom
of sincerity

   i congratulate you

  elaine tried to brush away a tear there
was no use denying may was a woman
and therefore she knew had she been a
man elaine would have answered but
 you cant fool a woman and no one knows
that fact better than a woman

  most of the passengers were on deck at
the time peering into the clear offing where
the sharp outline of old englands coast was
growing more perceptible with each revolu-
tion of the boats propellers the few who
were below at the time and happened to see
two pretty young women in each others
arms hugging and patting and kissing
might have been a bit surprised but they
were no more surprised than george clifford
when he returned to escort them to the res-
taurant

  he knew the moment he saw them that
the cat was out of the bag at heart he was
not sorry for it would divert the conversa-

tion to the subject that was foremost in his
mind-and too it was evidence that elaine
had taken him seriously

    i congratulate you too said may of-
fering clifford her hand  i congratulate
you you have got the very best girl in all
the world 

    oh i havent accepted him yet  elaine
said almost aloud and then looked around
fearing that some one had heard her

   oh but i- clifford hesitated

   a woman always has the privilege of
changing her mind said elaine

  but there was something in her smile and
in the look that came into her eyes that
made him understand that she wouldnt

  no matter how pleasant a trip at sea
may be no matter how jolly the journey
or how fine the weather the sight of land is
always welcome the vast ocean as ob-
served from shore fills one with awe its
power and majesty are difficult to compre-
hend and frequently the observer looks at
it with a touch of fear but the sight of land
from the sea is an entirely different matter

  one looks upon it as an old friend it
seems to hold out some welcoming cheering
hope and as it grows from a dim darkened
outline-as the ship approaches-until it
takes the more visible form of mountains
and valleys with cities nestling here and
there it seems to assure us that we belong to
it and not to the vast stretches of water that
surround it

  something of this sort stirred the heart
of elaine when the trio went up to the
hurricane deck after the rather elaborate
breakfast which clifford had ordered and
which partly served as a feast to celebrate
the engagement-although elaine said that
she would not as yet give her consent-
the green cliffs of the british mainland were
plainly to be seen

  the passengers were all on deck now
those who thought that they knew were
pointing out spots of interest v

  the big boat had the currents and the
tide in her favor as the land loomed
larger she seemed to move faster before
the day was more than three hours past the
noon the titan was inside the harbor

  elaine had stood on one side of george
clifford and may on the other every new
thing that came to their view caused them
all the joy of the traveler who is making
his journey for the first time

   finally the titan was ready for the dock
through by sunrise



she was slowly nosing into the little harbor
studded with all manner of craft more
busy than all the rest were the puffing tugs
that were to see the liner safe alongside her
wharf

  we had better go down now and finish
packing said may breaking the silence

  she darted off leaving george and
elaine alone

    isnt it glorious elaine   said the man

  glorious yes it is very glorious and
wonderful and i am so happy i had
almost forgotten the real quest of our jour-
ney elaine said with some feeling

   i want you to tell me something before
we land said george leaning close to her

  he slipped her hand into his and waited

   i want you to say yes now-before
we go ashore just look up into my eves
and say  yes

  another moment passed she did not
take her hand from his he was so close
to her that she -seemed to be leaning against
him for support

  then all of a sudden she turned her
wonderful face up to his her eyes mir-
rored the glory of life her lips parted
she silentlv muttered so he could just barely
hear yes

  a shudder ran through her body the
man whose wife by that word she had
promised to be squeezed her hand with all
the assurance that the situation afforded

  they hurried to their staterooms for
there was little time left for the final
packing

  when they appeared on deck again they
had all their traveling-bags with them
england being a free - trade country the
traveler is not molested by inquisitive cus-
toms agents all that one need do is to
go ashore with his trunks

  the only obstacle to his landing is the
numberless porters and carriers these
men are ever ready with open palms for
tips but they will work with a will once
they receive the price of a drink

  elaine and may stood aside and admired
the clever manner and the swiftness with
which george despatched their luggage

  in a few moments they were aboard a
train bound for london there they spent
the night in the morning when they
looked out of the windows of the little hotel
near the inns of court-that historic sec-
tion of old london devotedly loved by its
corps of barristers-a dense fog enveloped
everything

  one must really experience a london fog
to understand its density it will settle over
the city for days during its stay it is
impossible for one to see three feet ahead
of him

  many of the stores are closed the jew-
elry establishments put up their heavy steel
or iron shutters to prevent robbery the
cabmen - on whom the burden of traffic
depends-are obliged to lead their horses
they lead the animal by the bridle with
one hand and in the other they carry a
torch-the flames of which prevent them
from colliding with other vehicles

  the fog kept them indoors for three
days it was declared to be the densest
that london had known in years on the
morning of the fourth day it raised suffi-
ciently to allow them to proceed to euston
station without hindrance from euston
station they took the express to devon

chapter xvii
in the fog

turing the three days that clifford
and the girls were held prisoners by
the fog of old london they passed the time
telling stories both elaine and may were
particularly fond of tales about dogs and
they were not slow in letting george under-
stand that a good dog story would please
them more than anything else so george
agreed and i know that you will want to
hear the story that he related about cobs
before we journey on with our friends to
devon this is just as he told it

  how can we do it mrs lawrie
asked

   its rough on him-and us replied
jack lawrie tracing the pattern of the car-
pet with a restless boot-toe  but-its-got
to be i suppose just like parting with
one of ourselves isnt it cobs is-

   cobs himself prevented the finishing of
the sentence hearing his name he had
leaped out of the hall window-sill from
which point of vantage he had been watch-
ing his chum fifine the french poodle
who lived next door trying to catch spar-
rows on the lawn cobs grinned broadly
and chuckled with every muscle of his
body when the sparrows dodged the poodles
rushes and chirped contemptuously from the
maple boughs

resting his chin on his masters knee
cobs looked up with topaz eyes that were


the railroad mans magazine

limpid wells brimming with loyalty his
stump of a tail with measured beat and
slow declared his affection for his master

  good old chap said jack looking
down into the honest eyes of the dog

  with a sigh of satisfaction and an ac-
celeration of the tail signals cobs removed
his chin and crossed the room to pay his
devoirs to his mistress receiving from
her a hearty patting and some loving words
he waited until his gentlemanly instincts
told him that it was proper to take his
departure for the hall window

   a silence fell  the young couple

  after all bea said jack its only
for a time you knows chusmann is a
very decent sort he loves dogs too cobs
is sure to have plenty of grub which he
mightnt get for the present if he stuck
to us

   i know dear quavered the little
woman it isnt that i think that cobs
wont be treated kindly or be well taken
care of but-its the parting with him
im sure that hell be just as miserable
without us as well be without him

  jack rose and took the girl in his arms
and stopped the quivering of her lips with
a touch of his own

   of course of course he said sooth-
ingly well all of us feel this-breaking
up of the family most awfully but dont
forget bea that its only for a time why
the very moment we get that snug mite of
a flat not far from riverside park so that
cobs can chevy sparrows and fish for sticks
to his hearts content hell join us again
 are you sure that chusmann will give
him up when we want him 

  well hes consented to sign an agree-
ment to the effect that as soon as weve paid
him what we owe him plus the amount of
cobss board-bill cobs himself is to be re-
turned to us in good condition

  bea nodded a rather dreary approval of
the arrangement

   cobs is worth in the open market to-
day- began jack

  market said mrs lawrie her big
eyes wide with vague fear

   you blessed innocent laughed her
husband  i believe that you think of a
market in connection with saws and cleav-
ers and gory butchers blocks no i dont
intend that cobs shall grace a pot-roast
which i believe is aleutian islandese for
dog-served-in-every-style  

    dont jack

  all right dear but as i was about
to say i could sell cobs to any fancier for
at least a couple of hundred dollars chus-
mann admits this we owe him nearly fifty
dollars so you see hes got lots of se-
curity for his debt and bea the bully
old fellow whispered to me just as i was
leaving  my frent meester laweree ef
you vant any meats more alretty take em
vell sharge em up der dog against you
hoongry dont go slong dis store opens is
yes my regarts the leetle frau to and
compliments mit this the bag in

   so thats where the chicken came
from said bea with a rippling laugh

    yes 

   why didnt you tell me before i was
horribly afraid that our troubles had driven
you to desperation-and our neighbors
roosts

    id raid them soon enough if i thought
you needed a fricassee

  silly replied the wife -snuggling
close to him are you never going to
get over that kind of nonsense

  never said jack stoutly-and hus-
band and wife straightway forgot their
troubles in remembering the things that
love had wrought for them

  for three generations the firm had been
lawrie  son importers of fiber the con-
cern was the biggest in the business and
the canniness of mckenzie lawrie the
founder seemed to pass with other assets
from heir to heir it was an unwritten
but stanchly honored law that the eldest
son of the head of the firm should at birth
be made a full-fledged partner his share of
the profits being duly placed to his credit
in the care of a regularly appointed
guardian

  when this son was of an age to begin his
life-work he took up his burdens of the
business as a matter of preordination
and this routine had stood for four gen-
erations jack being the last link in the
chain of the lawrie traditions

   long before his son had left college mr
lawrie with the fatuity of a stubborn
father had planned a matrimonial alliance
for jack which would mean the ending of
an ancient business feud between lawrie 
son and its only rival of note closely
bardon  hollister as a matter of fact
there wasnt a bardon or a hollister any
more but there was a closely and he was
legions in himself closely had an only
daughter bethida was a trifle passe per-
through by sunrise



haps but she looked pretty well at dinner
 if the candle shades were of the right color
and sufficiently opaque she was square-
shouldered rode to hounds and was a
member of several womens clubs but
closely was rich he limped with a su-
perb gout and possessed a nose of the hue
and dimensions of a beet-root he wasnt
averse to an honorable peace with lawrie
if it didnt mean an appearance of defeat
and a lessening of revenue

  lawrie had sounded closely about the
welding of business interests by means of
a union of jack and bethida and closely
jumped-metaphorically of course-at the
idea then followed discussions and con-
ventions and at length it was agreed that
the interests of the two firms should be
pooled on the day of jacks engagement to
bethida to the utter confusion and over-
throw of all rival fiber concerns great or
small

  jack on the completion of his college
course was promptly shipped to europe
and told to remain there for at least two
years

   i am going to make you travel my
boy said mr lawrie so that you may
find out how deuced little you know of
course you will make an ass of yourself
but dont be more kinds of an ass than you
can help youll get a liberal monthly
allowance but not a penny more if you
fall into traps especially those that are
baited with petticoats you will have to
wriggle out of them as best you can
dont look to me for any assistance

  jack departed followed his fathers in-
structions to the best of his ability and
returned to the land of his birth freighted
with a fair knowledge of the world in gen-
eral and paris in particular

  he plunged into business and at once
gave evidence that he was fitted to play the
secondary role in the cast of lawrie  son
after a time mr lawrie senior bethought
himself that affairs were ripe for the intro-
duction of miss closely jack met the girl
and was a trifle disgusted but yet more
amused at her mannish fads miss close-
ly having in mind her approaching thirties
made up to jack as best she knew how but
the young fellow in his wildest flights
of fancy never dreamed that miss closely
who had been taken into her fathers con-
fidence looked upon him as a prospective
husband

  of course he never suspected that his

father had taken the liberty of mapping out
his matrimonial career

   so a year passed the husband of jacks
only sister died suddenly and the widow
and her two children became members of
the lawrie mansion on madison avenue
the girls were respectively six and eight
years ol age elinor the eldest was very
delicate it was decided to entrust the pre-
liminary education of the girls to a nursery
governess and beatrice tolliver obtained
the position it may be that way down in
the tough old heart of mr lawrie there
was a touch of compunction for beatrice
whose father had died after the going up
of his firm which was put out of business
by lawrie  sons cornering operation

   miss tolliver was a wildfiower kind of a
girl with eyes of vivid violet and a per-
sonality that exuded the delicate sweetness
of an evening primrose jack promptly
fell in love with her and after months of
quiet and persistent wooing she at length
acknowledged that she had just as promptly
fallen in love with him

  of the storm in the lawrie household
when jack told his father of his feelings
for the girl of the threats promises and
entreaties with which mr lawrie sought
to shake his sons determination to make
beatrice his wife of the final expulsion of
jack from the firm plus his two thousand
five hundred dollars and minus his bril-
liant prospects and of the amazement that
filled the fiber world when on the day of
jacks marriage the sign over the offices on
water street was altered from lawrie 
son to lawrie  company this history
need not deal in detail

  after a rather prolonged honeymoon
jack obtained a position as buyer with a
rival of his father rented a little house in
new lyons a residential city on the sound
furnished it prettily and began to taste
the delights of the spring-time of matri-
mony it was about this time that cobs
came to lie one of the family

   meantime the unexpected was brewing in
the caldron of fate lawrie and closely
had more meetings

   why should we let that condemned
young fool of yours stand in the way of
consolidation as we intended   growled
closely

  why indeed acquiesced the other
then came the fiber combine which bred
many failures killed other combinations
and caused trouble in general


the railroad mans magazine

   jacks turn to feel a touch of one of the
tentacles of the octopus came in due course

   boss wants to see you in his private
office mr lawrie said the office-boy one
day

  jack began the old man hesita-
tingly  ive got rather unpleasant news for
you

  yes replied jack wondering if his
father was ill

  the fact is-oh hang it boy ill be
frank with you old closely has insisted
on your discharge and-we cant afford to
disregard his wishes weve been threat-
ened with reprisals if we dont get rid of
you closely knows that you know so
much about the inside business of the com-
bine that hes afraid -we will take advan-
tage of it and i think youll find that he
lias blacklisted you throughout the trade

  jacks mouth and eyes looked dangerous

    if it werent for dad he muttered  i
certainly would put an incidental spoke in
closelys wheel but-i cant as things
are

  you know what i think of you per-
sonally jack his boss went on yet
how can i afford to buck the combine
count on me as a friend and draw on the
cashier for a month ahead

  jack broke the idings very gently to
bea that night cobs listening meanwhile in
his favorite pose-his chin on his masters
knee and bea to the intense surprise of
her husband instead of crying  oh dear
what will become of us or bursting into
tears came to him with flushed cheeks and
shining eyes and putting her arms around
his neck said

  what do we care dear my clever
brave old boy you can do just whatever
you set your mind on im only too glad
that youre out of that stuffy office so
there 

  the prediction that he was blacklisted
in the trade proved to be true all his old
friends were cordial-but nothing more
some were frank others tried to spare his
feelings but all were as a unit in refusing
him employment then he turned to other
trades only to find that he was rated as
a sort of unskilled laborer and would be
compensated as such

  next he tried to make use of the techni-
cal knowledge he had acquired at college
and discovered that he would have to begin
at the foot of the ladder which he couldnt
afford to do he sought a position as

coach but found the field overcrowded
he experimented with subscription books
and life insurance each of these efforts-
which in all covered nearly a twelvemonth
-brought returns but of a microscopic
sort

  all through those trying days the little
wife was a bloom of cheerfulness and com-
fort finally the day arrived when cast-
ing up accounts he found that he had a
bank balance of seventy-three dollars owed
the new lyons tradespeople about eighty
dollars another months rent would soon
be due and he had no employment

  jacks sister acting under her physicians
advice had journeyed to the south of france
for an indefinite period so the elder law-
rie was alone in the big house on madison
avenue closely disregarding his doctor
orders had celebrated the successful con-
summation of a big deal with a dinner where
the wines outnumbered the courses the
next morning he was found by his valet a
purple carcass the scarlet of his nose defy-
ing the pallid touch of death

  loneliness and trouble wrought a miracu-
lous change in the nature of lawrie senior
and one day he walked into the office of
jacks ex-employer

   ever hear anything of that precious
young rascal of mine

  np said the other cant say i do
stay though silsbee i remember saw him
at the grand central depot about a month
ago said he looked a trifle peaked said
he was living at new lyons

   umph  grunted lawrie senior and
walked out of the office the other man
raised his eyebrows took some meditative
whiffs of his cigar and muttering
shouldnt wonder began to paw and
finger and pull apart a lot of stuff that
looked like a tangle of dirty hair

  lawrie senior was speeding toward new
lyons

  looking peaked is he serves him
right confound him ill just take a look
at the quarters the young fools have tum-
bledown cottage or a cheap flat ill war-
rant hope hes realizing what a fool hes
been wonder if they have a baby of
course they have people who cant keep
themselves always try to have a family
so as to add to their troubles if its a
boy wonder if it looks like jack

  the train drew into the station a
guarded inquiry at the post-office of the
little town put mr lawrie in possession of
through by sunrise



jacks address but he didnt go there
direct

  theyll be loafing about their piazza
if they have one and if they happen to see
me theyll think im here to hoist the white
flag he meditated and with the assistance
of a voluble small boy made his way to
the sea front determined to wait until dusk
before inspecting the home of his son

  on the beach was a small board-walk
lined with benches on one of these mr
lawrie sat down noticing mechanically that
the only other occupant was a fat rosy in-
dividual who was smoking a cigar with the
aid of a huge meerschaum holder of unmis-
takable teutonic manufacture a band
played softly from a point on the rocks
the sands were dotted with couples and
family groups and the unruffled surface of
the sound was flecked by specks of snowy
canvas

  mr lawrie had been sitting there for
fifteen minutes or so thinking many things
and feeling the emphasis of his loneliness
by reason of the companionship of those
around him when he was startled by some-
thing cold and clammy being insinuated
into the palm of his hand

  looking down he saw cobs-cobs with
a kindly light in his eye and a cordial
if not effusive wag of his stump of a tail
seeing that he was recognized cobs once
more put his nose trustingly into the hand
of the fiber magnate sniffed meditatively
and again beamed a welcome of a very
sincere sort

  the fat rosy one on the bench burst into
unctuous laughter

  veil veil said he cobs wants frents
to make yet cobs not often hands shakes
like dat oonless he would be chumps yes
 does he belong to you  

  ach no i myself wish dat he vas
mine he lives his peeples vitli-meester
lawrie and meesus lawrie fine peoples
yes see dem dere on the sand-der leetle
frau mit the blue dress ach der nicest
peeples as vas but-

  but what

   veil i tinks me dey vas pretty hard up
dey owes me money but i dont mind no
dey goes to live in new york soon alrettv
cobs he stay mit me ven dey goes

  why do you take charge of cobs

   oh chust arrangements frents be-
tween dats all cobs he like new
lyons better as new york yes and
chusmann wheezed laboriously

  but mr lawrie accustomed to draw in-
ferences from hints guessed the situation
on the instant and he felt almost angry
with himself because he experienced no
satisfaction in learning that jack was suf-
fering for his alleged disobedience so he
looked long and longingly at the young
couple on the sands he saw how the girl
unconsciously leaned against her husband
and how the latter as unconsciously sup-
ported her and seeing felt something
within him soften melt and vanish

  then with a parting pat for cobs who
had been snuggling confidingly against his
leg all this time and a friendly nod to
chusmann mr lawrie with the loneliness
tugging more strangely than ever at his
heart-strings made his way back to the
village

  the lawrie cottage stood in one of the
parks of new lyons wherein each house
is separated by a lawn and there are shade-
trees in abundance

  the roads in the park are of the ser-
pentine sort so that a landscape effect is
obtained within the compass of a small
area

  opposite the cottage is a wooded slope on
the crest of which stands the house of the
rich man of the town from a picturesque
standpoint the scheme of new lyons i
admirable but its police force is of an un-
certain quantity and the town council is
economical in the matter of street-lights
the town is one of the halting stations of
the migratory tramp

  the lawrie family had just finished their
meager supper the dishes all being
washed and things generally tidied up they
were comfortably seated in their little den
when cobs came to his feet with a bound
giving tongue to his battle-cry lie made
a rush for the street door at which he
scratched frantically

   something up for sure remarked
jack as he opened the door the dog
with a fierce growl bounded over the
piazza railing to the lawn below and made
for a writhing heap in the roadway jack
followed but before he could overtake the
dog the heap resolved itself into two men
one of whom rose only to fall prone again
while the other was striking desperately at
cobs who was clinging like a leech to his
wrist

  cobs was too skilled a warrior to allow
himself to be finally vanquished on ac-
count of a preliminary advantage and so


the railroad mans magazine

lie suddenly loosed his hold at once the
man turned and ran this was what cobs
wanted before the biped had gone a
couple of yards the quadruped with a long
antelopelike leap had fastened his fangs
in the back of the mans neck shrieking
with pain and terror he fell backwards
the hot breath and low growls of his cap-
tor playing on his face

   hold him cobs  shouted jack  ill
be there in a moment cobs replied gut-
turally that he would sinking his teeth a
trifle deeper as he did so

  bea peering anxiously from thfe ver-
anda heard her husband call

   bring a lamp 

  bea obeyed the young people saw with
amazement consternation anj pity that the
man who had risen and fallen again was
jacks father-insensible dust-covered and
blood-stained

   ill get him into the house at once
said jack you telephone for dr jar-
kins and get the spare bed ready

  what about the other man asked
bea

   dr cobs is attending to him all right
but ill see to him presently taking his
father in his arms jack carried him very
tenderly into the house which he had never
expected to see him enter

  it was two days later and mr lawrie
weak and shakv but rapidly recovering
from the assault upon him was lying in
lied telling jack and bea of his adventure
incidentally he held the hands of his son
and daughter-in-law and his eyes sought
their faces hungrily

  dear old dad said jack so you
reallv wanted to see where we were camped
out

  mr lawrie nodded yes he said
and-and-jack you didnt have the
shades down in the room in which you were
sitting

 no

  no and so after id seen you and
bea as i then did if that scoundrel hadnt
given me a tap on the head at that moment
i-think-i-should have asked you for a
nights lodging

  jack squeezed his fathers hand con-
vulsively

   where is our footpad by the way
asked mrs lawrie

   in the hospital-as a prisoner cobs
mauled him badly the man turns out to
lie a hold-up whos very much wanted by

the police cobs had a narrow squeak for
his life too for the man was trying to
get at him with a knife he couldnt as
cobs had sense enough to grab him by
the nape of the neck

  god bless cobs said mr lawrie
fervently  if it hadnt been for him i
mightnt have been here with you bea
my girl i dont blame jack a bit i was
a stubborn old-

  bea deliberately placed a rosy palm over
his mouth  youre talking far too much
now try and have a good long nap while
jack and i get up a nice little dinner for
you

  mr lawrie smiled drowsily and con-
tentedly  all right he said with a
yawn and jack ill have that sign-
made-over into lawrie-and son bea
would you like me to buy you-this cottage
for-a-wedding present  good dog good
dog good cobs good-

chapter xviii
reunited for life

t tncle tom and billee and the house-
hold marveled at the three strangers
who appeared at the lodge gates one after-
noon

  a more glorious sunshine had never been
seen on the coast as devon was popularly
known it seemed as if a day of peculiar
brightness had been specially created for
the arrival of elaine and her friends

  sunshine does so much to bring gladness
into our lives and when uncle tom clasped
elaine to his breast and billee-now a
grown girl just budding into the delight of
her early years of understanding-greeted
her with all the affection of a daughter
welcoming her mother george clifford and
may pierce stood aside and let the willing-
tears come to their eyes

   billee said elaine motioning to clif-
ford  i have brought home your father
the man and the little girl looked at
each other quizzically for a second it
only took the second for the man to see-
to know the child was less sure she
had lived so long an orphan that it was
difficult for her to understand that the
tall handsome gentleman beaming on her
with a kindly face was really one of the
lost parents that she had loved as myths

george clifford approached the little
girl getting down on one knee he held
through by sunrise



out his arms to her the instinct of the
child for its parent-the wonderful instinct
inculcated by heaven never to die-told
little billee that her life would no longer
be devoid of the dearest attraction that a
child can know

  she rushed into her fathers arms and
the kisses that he showered on her face and
neck the tears that dimmed his eyes and
the words of endearment that he uttered
assured her that he was really her father
and that his heart was filled with love and
devotion

  and clifford knew that the little girl
was his own one by one her features
slowly unfolded before his eyes little by
little uncle tom told his story of the
coming of billee into his possession

  and on that day father and daughter
were united in life

  the following morning george clifford
took his little daughter for a walk through
the vast flower -gardens of her foster-
parents home

  when they were finally seated under a
reat oak planning all manner of wonder-
ful plans for the future he said to her

   billee dear i have found a new mother
for you i want you to be very kind and
sweet to her for she loves you dearly-and
she is one of the loveliest beings that
heaven ever created

the

    daddy i am so happy do tell me-
who 

    elaine he said  elaine who brought
 me to you-who found you for me elaine
 who brought the song of the nightingale to
 america and told me hat my little girl was
 still alive

    im so happy dear daddy said billee
 throwing her arms around his neck isnt
 she just the sweetest dearest elaine

   a few days later the marriage was sol-
 emnized in the little chapel on uncle toms
 estate billee clifford was the bridesmaid
 and uncle tom was the best man and may
 pierce was a maid of honor with a great
 bunch of roses

   she thanked heaven that such happiness
 could come to man and woman and a little
 child

   for some weeks they lingered at beauti-
 ful devon before returning to new york
 and every evening mr and mrs clifford
 and billee sat in the groves surrounding
 that old english home and listened to the
 song of the nightingales

   isnt it wonderful my darling said
 george

    wonderful oh so wonderful-so won-
derful answered elaine

    and the night before you came said
 little billee  it seemed as if they didnt
 get through singing until sunrise

 old engineer honored

the erie railroads reward to harvey springstead for the careful and
intelligent management of his engine

qlite a sensation was sprung on the erie
employees and patrons when engine 
recently appeared looking as if it had just come
out of the bandbox the number had been trans-
ferred - from under the cab-windows to the
sand-box and the name of its engineer harvey
springstead appeared in big gilt letters on the
cab

  xo one had seen an engine  the new york
division bearing a mans name since the en-
gineers built the  daniel willard  for the chi-
cago exposition in  and this graceful  g-
 engine naturally aroused interest and curi-
osity as to what it all meant

  the distinction was awarded for the excellent
performance the lack of failures and the general
good condition of the engine while under the

    	rr

careful and intelligent management of mr
springstead

  the engine was last shopped in october 
having made over  miles since last previous
general repairs

  engineer springstead started firing in s
 the goshen way-train arid when  ed 
haggerty who was his engineer retired in 
harvey who had just been promoted to engineer
took his place and has been continuously in the
passenger-train service since with a remarkably
good record

  he started railroading when a mere boy and
notwithstanding his long term of service is still
far from the retiring limit being only  years
of age and looks forward to many more years
on the running-boaid
larry left alone

by macduffie martin

   another odd happening helps to sustain the
   ancient adage  it isnt all gold that glitters

arry was the first man of his race
and color to wander into
the forest primeval beyond
the svvamac river that
noble body of water was
the only route that the
indians had followed into the cold country
north of  fifty-three made famous by the
oft-repeated statement that never a law of
god or man existed there

  larry had been a switchman on a little
branch of the n x ever since he was old
enough to go out into the world and sup-
port a widowed mother his father had
worked on the line before him but when
he lost his life in a wreck and left abso-
lutely nothing with which to educate his
son or keep his widow in bread and meat
larry was obliged to look into the future
without blinking

  it is only natural therefore that he
should take up the calling in which his
father had spent the best years of his life
the division superintendent was willing to
give a helping hand he told larry that
he would have to begin at the beginning
and larry did begin at the very beginning
on the day that we begin this chronicle of
his career he had worked up to the position
of a switchman  and he was a good one

  he was so good on the job that when he
announced his intention of quitting and
following the ill-conditioned rumors of the
indians that were wafted down from the
north more than one man tried to turn
him against them

  these rumors told of wonderful deposits
of gold that existed in that faraway spot
north of fifty-three they were similar
to the rumors that made men leave their
homes and seek fortunes in the klondike

     larry had a mind that turned to riches
  quickly gained unlike his fatiier he did
  not believe in a steady position with a
  certain increase of pay every year and a
  comfortable humble home he didnt want
  to be one of the great army of men who
  work for a wage

     he had visions of owning a railroad of
  his own some day and when the rumors of
  gold in the wilderness reached his ears and
  he had digested them thoroughly he said
  unto himself that he would go thither come
  back rich-and then who could stop him

     he told his ood mother when he start-
  ed that he woutd come home rich within
  a year lest she should want for the neces-
  sary commonplaces of life during his ab-
  sence he turned over to her all his savings
  -and they amounted to a sum that was not
  to be sneezed at larry was blessed with
  thrift all men who know the value of a
  dollar are blessed with it he took with
  him only sufficient to travel so far as the
  railroad ran-and he haggled with agents
  for second-class tickets and tourist rates
  until they were willing to grant his wishes
  out of sheer despair

     leaving the final terminus of the rail-
  road he embarked in a small steamboat up
  the svvamac aboard the boat the rumors
  were thicker than the gadflies that infested
  the region in summer

     larry was told by the red-bearded indi-
  vidual who guided the destiny of the craft
  that the man who first penetrated the deso-
  late region would not only find gold on the
  bushes but he would stumble over it at
  every step the only drawback would be
  the finders lack of strength to bring back
  to civilization all that he could carry

    how did the captain know the in-

larry left alone



dians had told him he had talked with
them time and again on the little wharf at
fifty hole the most northerly point on
the swamac where the boat stopped and
finally when it did arrive there and started
down stream on its homeward journey
larry watched it with a plaintive watching
until it disappeared around a bend between
the high palisades that guarded its banks
then he turned to the indians

   the gold-fields were miles and miles far-
ther north he would find them by fol-
lowing the swamac some ten miles and
then by making an overland journey of
some five or six miles he would save some
distance caused by a bend in the river

  when he reached the river again he
would find a portage the river could be
crossed at that point in a canoe which he
would find high on the bank once across
he should follow the trail-it would not be
hard to find-follow it for another five
miles or more then opliir and monte-
zuma and king solomons mines were his

  larry reached his destination it was a
wild desolate spot the river was near
by for that he was thankful as far as
the eye could see there were great moun-
tains that rolled upward to fields of eternal
snow around him was a massive prairie
marked hither and yon with clumps of
trees and stretches of grass and the most
imposing effect in this wilderness was a
small rock- mountain-perhaps it would
be more modest to call it a hill-that jutted
out of the earth more like a peculiar monu-
ment than anything else

  undoubtedly this was the storehouse of
the gold beyond all doubt this was the
receptacle of -his fortune within it rock-
ribbed sides rested the real thing

  truly mohammed had come to the
mountain

  he would delve into it without further
ado fill a scuttle or two of the precious
metal and make his way back to fifty
hole then he would return for another
scuttle or two-and so on until he had
accumulated sufficient to fill the steamboat
when it reached fifty hole

  then he would hike back to his mother
and his native town and buy the n x
and any other road that might happen to lie
on the market

  when he ceased building his castles in
the air it dawned upon him that he was
feeling somewhat lonesome of course
there was no human habitation in sight

  larry was the first of his race and blood
to inhabit the place he had brought bacon
and crackers and tea he had also brought
matches carefully rolled in a piece of rub-
ber cloth and a pipe and some tobacco
but as lie gazed over the wild circumjacence
lie realized that he had not a place to lay
his head

  perhaps it would be best to return to
fifty hole and camp there and make the
journey to and from the mountain of gold
every day brilliant thought he would
then be a commuter in the wilderness but
as he looked at the sun just beginning to
tip the mountains in the west he knew that
he could not make fifty hole again that
night

  near the base of the mountain of gold
he found a little space that nature had
caused between two large boulders the
rock rose sharp and perpendicular on either
side the floor was covered with a fine
gravel and the entire opening gave him
some six square feet in which to seek some
shelter

  it lacked a roof but that troubled him
only a little the night was clear and
there was no sign of rain or wind be-
sides it was only for one night-and surely
a man could rough it for one night when
fortune was all around him

  he stood between the two boulders-the
entrance to his primeval home-and looked
around what a wonderful stillness what
a marvelous quiet adjusting his pack so
that it rested against the boulder he stepped
outside

  the twilight was just beginning to dim
the landscape he stepped a few feet far-
ther and stopped short just why he could
not tell a cold wind suddenly swept over
the prairie-the cold peculiar wind that
seems to be born of nightfall and is known
only in such places

  it made him button his coat about his
throat he listened again he thought he
heard a sound

  it was not an unfamiliar sound he
cocked his head to one side to be sure and
then started in its direction it came from
a projection of the hill about a hundred
feet away he walked thither to explore

  the sound was water - water gushing
from a spring and rilling along the ground
possibly to the swamac he knelt down
and drank of it he hastened back to his
cache and returned with his tin kettle and
filled it


the railroad mans magazine

   good   he said aloud  i will not
have to make a trip to the river every time
i want water

  that excitement over he stood again in
the entrance of his primeval home from
the river banks now came the croak of
strange throats and overhead some strange
bird circled and uttered shrill cries he
looked up at it and wondered why it
frightened him

  then he thought it was about time for
food gathering some dry branches he
soon had a fire over the fire he placed
his frying-pan as it warmed he sliced a
dozen strips from the side of bacon as
he threw the slices into the pan they sizzled
and browned and smelled-like home

  he placed the frying-pan on the ground
picking up the bacon slice by slice in his
fingers he devoured it with crackers as a
side dish and cool spring water for wine

  it was a rough meal-the first indeed
that he had ever cooked but what mat-
tered that when the price of a railroad or
two lay at his feet

  in a short time it was pitch-dark the
prairie wind was blowing up colder like-
wise it was blowing with more force it
is a wonderful wind that wind of the north-
western plains when it does blow it has
all the force of a northern titan sweeping
the world there is  obstacle in its
path - nothing to block the mighty mo-
mentum that it gains as the night comes on

  it blew right into the opening of larrys
primeval home so great was its velocity
nurtured in the northern canadian prairies
and increasing in volume as it came on
toward the south that it took larrys side
of bacon and his frying-pan and other ob-
jects of primeval art and swept them up
through the roofless habitat into the great
unknown

  such slight and simple commodities as
his crackers and his oolong tea were as the
leaves of yester year in its path he drew
himself into the further corner of the abode
with his legs close together his muscles
drawn taut and both hands holding his hat
down over his tightly closed eyes he won-
dered if he hadnt struck the only and
original cave of the winds

  this is a shine dump said larry

  he jammed his hat down tight for his
arms were getting numb this change
lasted only the faintest fraction of a second
the very instant that he dropped his hands
to his side he felt the wind getting under

his hat and he slammed his hands on it
with hammerlike velocity

  then he removed his hat and placed it
between his knees that gave his arms a
rest he didnt mind the breezes doing a
o-the-poor-indian stunt with his locks al-
though he felt the cold pierce his scalp
with none too tender touches

   pie thought that he would light his pipe
and try to smoke his attempt to fill the
bowl in that wind was a farce in the
crass darkness he could not tell which was
pipe and which was pouch and ere he
knew it the fine-cut was flying up into his
face and eyes

  believing that he had the bowl of the
pipe filled he turned his face to the wall of
his abode and brought his matches from his
pocket the first one that he struck went
out so did the second so did the third so
did the fourth-and so did the fourteenth

   at the end of this score he decided that
smoking was a luxury that he could not
afford-matches were too scarce but he
resolved to have one more try he crouched
down-down in the corner of the abode-
he drew his coat over his head and doubled
himself up into every conceivable posture
that would keep the howling wind from his
pipe

   then he took out another match  ith
the caution of a surgeon cutting through a

    o	oo

vein he struck it on his leg it flickered
and flamed up with equal caution he
thrust it into the bowl of his pipe and
puffed none of the old familiar flavor
permeated his palate he simply drew in
air the tobacco that he had put in his
pipe-if indeed he had really done so-
had been carried away by the wind

    this is a shine dump said larry

   he replaced his hat and jammed it tight
on his head bracing his back against the
back wall of his apartment he sat down
drawing his knees close to his chin he
clasped his hands about his knees and
huddled himself closer and closer together
 he thought that he would be comfortable
in this position to give him credit he
looked at it philosophically it was only a
matter of passing the night to be sure he
had been a trifle foolish in leaving fifty
hole that day without knowing more about
his destination but in the morning he
would return to fifty hole and arrange for
the proper covering to give him shelter un-
til he had dug sufficient from the mountain
of gold to satisfy his cravings
larry left alone



  compounds and cross-bars but it was
cold colder indeed than he had ever
felt even in that northern territory of the
united states where he had lived since
boyhood

  he felt his hands getting more numb and
still more numb he removed them from
about his knees and thrust them into his
pockets ah that felt good that was-

  presto his hat blew off it was lifted
from his head with such marvelous sud-
denness that it seemed as if some magic
wand not the wind were responsible for its
departure

  this is a shine dump said larry

  he took his handkerchief from his pock-
et and tied it under his chin that at
least would protect his head from the ter-
rible cold then he huddled up closer and
closed his eyes perhaps he might fall
asleep perhaps the guarding providence
would temper the wind to his shorn and
unsheltered seclusion and let him have a
little peace

  he closed his eyes he closed them so
tightly that he clenched his teeth instinc-
tively-and there he sat and still sat won-
dering just how many hours still remained
until the dawn in truth he had been
there but an hour since darkness it seemed
like an eternity

  finally there came a lull in the wind
larry knew this because the seemingly in-
cessant and unmodulating noise that it
made as it coursed through the trees and
over the wastes had somewhat abated

  inside his primeval abode there was more
quiet outside the wind seemed to be ta-
king a more spasmodic velocity every lit-
tle while it would cause a terrific rustling
among the trees and then it would die away
as if intent on spending itself with brag
and bluster

  that was some blow said larry

  he stretched himself out on the hard
floor with one arm for a pillow he was
ready for rest his bones ached and his
brain buzzed with the night noises that
would not cease but he began to doze

   sleep is not recreation it is re-creation
if ever a man needed to be re-created larry
did that night sleep came to him and
wound him in her tender satisfying arms

  some moments passed

  touched by the peculiar instinct that
presages fear he awoke he sat straight
up with every faculty alert it was still
as dark as stygian desolation butit was

calmer and there was only the faintest
breeze astir

  faint though it was it brought to his
nostrils the most peculiar odor that ever
greeted his sense of smell it reminded
him of the animal tent of a circus he
sniffed-and then he sniffed some more

  there was a rustling on the gravel out-
side-a rustling -as if some animal were
passing to and iro

  larrys heart-beats were as audible as the
regular striking of a clock his breath
came in short gasps he could feel his
face quiver with fear

  suddenly as if flashed from a cannon
two green eyes appeared at the opening of
the abode

  larry surmised that they were eyes for
they moved now and then and also the
thing or beast or demon was panting as a
dog will pant when out of breath

  at first he thought that it was a dog
but when it suddenly filled the night with
the most raucous combination of half bark
and half yelp larry concluded that it
wasnt evidently tired of this mode of
noise-making it barked with slow gut-
tural soul-piercing profundity and wound
up with a wail so dismal that it smote lar-
ry to the core

  a coyote had scented him out-but it
might have been a polar bear or a moun-
tain-lion or a baltimore oriole so far as
he knew

  brushing his hand over the ground he
encountered a stone he raised his arm
and let it fly directly at the glowing eyes
whatever accomplishments larry may have
lacked he was a game lad

  he realized that his adversary had him
cornered and he was ready to show fight-
the stone wasevidently well aimed he
heard it strike something with a thud and
fall to the ground

  the coyote emitted one dismal cry and
fled it went on its way bellowing and
yelping and howling with intermittent
pauses and from the rapidly diminishing
volume of its cry larry realized that it
had lost no time in getting beyond his
reach

   this is a shine dump said larry

  he arose and stepped outside the abode
the peculiar silence of the dead of night
now brooded over all the wind storm had
abated the trickle of the water was ap-
parent once more the plaintive boom of a
night bird was heard across the distance
s

the railroad mans magazine

and overhead the golden stars glistened in
a spray of splendor

  larry walked to and fro for the chill
was still in the air so bright was the
light of the stars that the entrance to his
abode was plainly visible and indeed it
was easy to read the time of night on his
watch it was only a little after eleven
oclock

  oh the long lonesome night that
stretched before him how in the name of
heaven was he going to live through it
would the light of day ever come again

  he sat on the ground he tied the hand-
kerchief tighter around his throat he got
on his feet and made his way to the rill
of water he stooped and drank when
he started to rise again his foot slippecf
and he would have got a good wetting if
he had not broken his fall by catching a
twig as it was one leg was wet nearly
to the knee it made him feel uncomfort-
able	

  he entered his abode again determined
to sleep despite the saturated trouser-leg
and the bitter cold and the disgruntled
thoughts that were whirling through his
brain he again took a recumbent position
on the ground and closed his eyes

  in a little while he was fast asleep

  two or three times he awoke and stretched
his numbed body then he fell into a
deeper sleep from which he did not awake
until the sun was fairly high in the heav-
ens penetrating his body with its warm and
comforting rays

  this felt so very good that he decided to
lie there a little longer and get warmed
through and through the leg that had
received the wetting was a trifle stiff so he
thought he would rub it a little

  as he reached down his hand encoun-
tered close to his body as queer an object
as ever blocked his -sense of touch it was
a warm leathery moist pulsating sort of a
thing

  larry squeezed it-he squeezed it rather
hard it emitted a hissing sound and lar-
ry felt it spring from his grasp something
after the manner of a hawser running
through a pulley

  the acrobatic avidity displayed by larry
as he got on his feet could never be told in
words he had just time to see a huge
rattlesnake make an  s -like exit through
the entrance of his abode and lose itself in
a crevice in the rocks

  larry was thoroughly frightened he

wondered if he were bitten it is an old
trick of rattlers at night-and he dyl-not
know it-to coil up close to aman sleeping
on the plains the warmth of the- human
body is most pleasing to this poisonous spe-
cies of reptile it has never been known
to harm a man whose body has afforded a
nights shelter but larry did not know
that

  he drew his lips tightly together and
felt real fear filling his throat when he
could utter a sound again he simply said

  this is a shine dump

  one resolution was quickly established
in his mind gold or no gold-monte-
zuma or no mazuma-that was no place for
a white man to sleep money was all very
well in its way but if it could only be
mined in the wilderness at the risk of a
reptiles fangs then a job on the section-
gang at a dollar per were paradise enow

 at any rate he would go back to fifty
hole and-get breakfast there was no
great hurry in commencing the actual work
of prospecting and a day or so spent in
fifty hole would give him a chance to re-
cuperate his peace of mind and get another
hat

  he began to retrace his footsteps and
ere nightfall he was again within the shel-
tering confines of the outpost

  that night after a good dinner-and a
drop or two of frontier rum he wandered
into a place that bore the name angels
rest

  three or four frontier outcast-trappers
who were awaiting the opening of their sea-
son-induced him to  sit in  a poker
game

  it lasted until well into the night when
larry arose from the table hewas minus
his spare cash his watch his coat and vest
and his prospectors outfit

  the keeper of the place let him sleep on
the dilapidated billiard-table because he
hadnt the price of a bed when he awoke
in the morning and sauntered down the
only thoroughfare he was good and  sore
and he had a taste in his mouth that was
of the dark brown variety mixed with a
little lemon

  soon he found himself at the rivers
bank there the gladdest sight that had
met his eyes since he left home was before
him tied to her primitive dock was the
boat that had conveyed him up the swa-
mac her red-bearded captain was lean-
ing against one of the bitts larry could
larry left alone



have punched his smiling know-it-all coun-
tenance-but he needed a friend

  back so soon asked the captain
when do you start for-for home
was larrys answer

  two oclock going along

   if i have to hang on to the rudder
the skipper smiled grimly  cleaned
you out in a night eh  

   i havent got a cent-if thats what you
want to know said larry

   ill take you as far as i go said the
skipper id hate to see a man stranded
in these diggins take a hand at leadin
that freight there that will help pay for
your transportation

  some few nights after larrys good
mother was startled by a familiar knock
at her cottage door it came just as she
was in the midst of telling a few old friends

of larrys departure and of the possibility
of his great riches

  she looked at her guests with startled
countenance and rushed to the door she
swung it open and shrieked in dismay
was it larry or larrys ghost she would
have fallen but he caught her in his arms

   its only me ma he said as hekissed
her

  larry soon explained why his coat didnt
fit why he was wearing a cap two sizes
too large for him why he was covered with
soot and oil and looked generally as if he
had been used to mop up a roundhouse

  what can i do for you my boy said
his mother  oh what can i do for you-
im so glad that you are home

   cook me a plate of ham and eggs ma
said larry  and sit down and watch me
eat em

rapid railroad-bridge repairing

when the lackawanna railroad wanted a
new draw in its bridge across the hacken-
sack river new jersey a trifle in steel  feet
long and  feet wide between centers of trusses
weighing  tons it was built on the river-bank
parallel to the stream when finished it was lifted
on jacks swung around on its pivot at right
angles to the river and moved out on two boats
 feet long  feet wide and  feet deep

  similar boats were run under the old draw so
that when the tide rose the old was lifted up and
floated off while the new one was floated into
its place and lowered to position by the fall of
the tide this operation took ten hours but it
was done on a sunday when traffic was at its
lowest ebb the drawbridge across the passaic
was replaced in the same way april  
in twelve hours

  on august   master carpenter w k
heard of the pennsylvania railroad with one
hundred men moved mill creek bridge a struc-
ture  feet long with trusses  feet deep and
 feet apart weighing  tons  feet sidewise
to get it out of the way of the stone arch that was
to replace it in twelve minutes by the watch

  the chicago milwaukee and st paul planned
to rebuild the wooden truss-bridge across grand
river three miles south of chillicothc missouri
when it got around to it the structure consisting
of a pile-approach  feet long andfour spans
of  feet each resting on piic-piers was to be
rebuilt piecemeal the trusses first in  and
then the piers were to be replaced with masonry

  ijut the trusses went bad so suddenly that
action had to be taken sooner than was planned
when false work was put up for erecting the iron
the river rose anti piled a line of driftwood four

to twelve feet deep and extending up stream 
feet against the bridge moving the piers so they
had to be replaced in a hurry

  after the water had subsided and the drift
had been cleared away the iron trusses were
erected on the old wooden piers while the new
masnry-piers were being put down from twenty-
nine to thirty feet from the old the four spans
of iron weighing a total of  pounds which
were placed temporarily on the old piers were
all up november  s while the piers were not
finished until january is 

  girders were put in reaching from the old
piers to the new on top of which rollers with
flanges were placed beneath the bottom chords
of the new trusses then a six-part block and
tackle was fastened to the safety-struts in the
end of the first span a locomotive was hitched
to the other end of the tackle and then with a
conductor and brakeman to pass signals and
bridgemen to watch the tackle and attend to the
rollers that heavy span was dragged endwise
thirty feel to its new position as easily as a train-
crew could have spotted a car at an elevator
time six minutes

  eight carpenters put in a temporary track as
fast as the gap openedup so that traffic might not
be interrupted

  then when a suitable interval between trains
arrived span number two was dragged in place
it took nearly seven days of jockeying between
trains to get the job done but the longest time
consumed in moving any one of the spans was
nineteen minutes

  preparations added about an hour ro the mov-
ing time no passenger-train was delayed and
the longest delay of a freight was ten minutes

 a frontier man-hunt

by r m  west

the remarkable schemes that will come into a mans head while he is trying
to evade his pursuers often puzzle the most scientific minds these are
not the exact words but they represent the real sentiment of a famous
french detective one of the most noted sleuths of his day

    this story of jack malone a private in the united states army is based
on truth it is perhaps one of the most remarkable stories of a real man-
hunt ever recorded for nearly two weeks malone evaded his pursuers who
had him hemmed in on all sides during the hunt he even talked and walked
with some of them

running down an army desperado whose nimble body and keen brain
were more than a match for the scores of men
who were pursuing him

hen i first saw fort
leavenworth it was not
the fine military head-
quarters it is to-day
my first glimpse was
in june  when
the little side-wheeler new ella tied up to
the old rickety wharf to unload about three
hundred raw recruits of whom i was one

  we were assigned to the second cavalry
u s a then scattered all along the fron-
tier trying to check the murderous raids of
the indians

  the barracks were little low-roofed din-
gy buildings not at all suited to shelter the
many troops coming in every day the
fort was poorly laid out to-day with its
fine barracks hospital buildings officers
quarters and the beautiful drives fort
leavenworth is a splendid place to see

  across the missouri river as i remember
a dense woods ran close into the bank
there was a bridge in course of construc-
tion across the river its approaches on the
kansas side being just at the southern end
of the fort on the missouri side there was
low marshy land and a place called slab
city consisting of three houses and a saw-



mill owned and run by the reymond
brothers

  in those days there was a class of people
called river-traders who depended for their
living  the money picked up from people
along the banks of the river near fort
leavenworth these traders were very numer-
ous their stores were supposed to be
stocked with what the men from the fort
would be most apt to demand

  the trading buildings were not built 
the ground but were afloat on the river
first there would be a long wide flat-bot-
tomed boat from fifty to seventy feet in
length and fort feet wide then a house
built on this with just place enough left on
the ends and sides to work the paddles that
kept the boat guided in its drifting down
stream

  nearly all of those trading-boats were
called gunboats those tied up near the
fort were all loaded with liquors and just
enough little knickknacks to make a show
the owners did not dare to tie up on the
kansas side very near the fort but  the
missouri side they were safe the traders
were desperadoes and outlaws-many df
whom had a price  their heads

  one big ugly fellow named jack dim-
ming had what was known as the worst den
on the river when a neighborhood got too
hot for him lie would let go his lines at night
and drop down the river to some other mili-
tary camp or railroad outfit jack dim-
ming had been as far up stream as fort
benton and had been dropping down and
down until he was tied up about half a mile
below fort leavenworth  the missouri
side

aboard a  gunboat

  dimming had everything on his beat that
was calculated to draw a reckless man
there was a dance on board every night
many a time i have heard the mad music of
the horns and fiddles and the laughter of
whisky-crazed men and women across the
long space of water while i stood on guard

  dimming had four or five fellow despera-
does with him every sheriff knew that he
would have to get the drop on dimming as
he would not be taken alive

  the soldiers at the fort were forbidden
to go over the rhine as it was called but
they went just the same jack malone one
of the privates seemed to be very friendly
with dimming he was on dimmings boat
every spare moment he could get by de-
grees he began to go there on time that was
not his he would neglect roll-call and
duty

  first his commander called him up and
talked to him next he was punished but
all to no purpose he would take any risk
to get away

   still his commanding officer hesitated to
be severe one reason why malone was so
leniently dealt with was the fact that he was
a veteran and had been a faithful man
finally severe discipline was meted out to
him he was ordered to carry a heavy log
on his shoulder four hours on and two off
during twenty-four hours

malone makes a promise

  even this did not stop him and lie was
swung up by the wrists for ten hours while
undergoing this terrible punishment gene-
ral buell the commander of the fort stop-
ped and asked malone what he had done
to cause such punishment

  it was an old saying in the army that
the soldiers answer was nothin so that
a soldiers crime is known as nothin

  this time jack told the simple truth

he seemed to be sorry as well as ashamed
of his conduct and the generaladmonished
him and secured his promise that he would
stay away from the gunboat

  when malone made this promise the
general ordered him cut down he then
gave orders that malone be immediately re-
ported if he disobeyed

  one morning private malone was re-
ported absent and not accounted for that
night he did not show up at retreat or
taps the next morning as the men were
turning out for reveille we saw him gli-
ding from tree to tree in his endeavor to
gain the ranks unseen by the first sergeant
he managed to slip into ranks but as he
answered to his name he was told to step
to the front

  his captain spoke a few words to him
in a low tone then a guard was called and
malone was sent to the guard-house he
looked more like a fitting subject for the
hospital

  acting under orders from general buell
the provost sergeant prepared die punish-
ment which was to break him from again
visiting jack dimming malone was strip-
ped and a barrel with a hole cut in one end
just large enough to pass down over his
head and rest on his shoulders was put on
him then he was marched under guard
lo a large cottonwood-tree

left to his thoughts

  an opening was made in the barrel so
his wrists could be tied behind him this
was done with a piece of rope the rope
was thrown over a limb of the tree and
pulled until malone was bent over almost
double it was then made fast to the tree
and jack malone was left to his thoughts

  the day was a broiling one in july an
old sugar-barrel had been purposely used
this caused flies and mosquitoes to add
to the punishment

   about an hour before first call for dress
parade general buell walked over to the
tree

   well malone how do you like this
kind of duty he remadd

 not very well general he answered

    do you think it better to remain in the
fort and attend to your duty or to go over
to the gunboat

    it is better to do my duty general

  hereafter you will do your duty like a
man  
a frontier man-hunt



   yes general

  now malone do you really mean to
say that you wont go over to the gunboat
again if i let you down now  

   yes general i really mean that t will
never go there again

  well i will now let you down but bear
in mind that should you again go there this
days punishment is only a foretaste of
what you will get you
will now go to your
quarters and get ready
for dress parade - and
let me see that you do
attend dress parade

   oh yes general
buell you may be sure
i will be there

  the guard that was
over malone and heard
him say the words said
long afterward that he
knew that the suffering
prisoner meant no good
to general buell ma-
lone staggered to his
quarters and not long
after the bugle sounded
first call for dress pa-
rade

  it was a fine evening
and a large crowd had
come from the city a
twelve - company fort
with a good band of mu-
sic presents quite a
lively scene at dress pa-
rade i was out on duty
this day and was sitting
with two others in full
view of everything that
went on

  just after parade was
dismissed and the com-
panies were returning to
their barracks i saw
malone leave the ranks
and with his gun at a
trail start on a run for headquarters in
the confusion of the breaking up of the
parade no attention was paid to the desper-
ate man

  it struck me like a flash that he was bent
on murder i kept my eyes on him but
of course could do nothing in the way of
stopping him nor giving a warning shout
for i was too far away

  he ran like an antelope at one place

he was compelled to lower his head in
order to break through a group of people
he was about ten yards from general
buell

   something caused that officer to stop and
turn half way around probably the cock-
ing of malones rifle in that moment he
must have realized that his time had come
his wife and little girl were with him

dimming had everything on his boat that was calculated to
draw a reckless man

mrs buell raised her hands and screamed
malone dropped down on one knee took
deliberate aim and fired he jumped to
his feet and started on a mad run for the
woods

  general buell sank his hand clasping
the bullet in his breast

  some one give me a pistol that i may
kill my assassin he gasped those were
his last words he died in a few minutes


the railroad mans magazine

  malone had vanished in die grove over-
looking the river

j in an instant people were running in
every direction and officers were shouting
to the men to arm themselves and give
chase in half an hour except for the
guards there was hardly a man left in the
fort

the hunt begins

  there was little doubt that malone would
be captured at once although it was
nearly all woods along the bank of the
river it was entirely free of underbrush
yet it was conceded that if malone gained
the missouri side and got into the dense
timber he would be hard to find for this
reason men were hurried across the river in
boats and placed at short distances along
the edge of the far bank to head him off if
he took that direction but strange as it
may seem not a sign of malone was found

  all night diere were torches flaming in
the woods along the railroad was a picket
line of watching men boats were patrol-
ina the river but when davlisht came ma-
lone was still at large

  jack dimming and his gunboat had dis-
appeared fie had heard the news and very
discreetly dropped down the river although
lie knew nothing of malones deed until
told by some of the men giving-chase he
did not care however to brave the furi-
ous people

  it seemed very strange that malone was
able to evade all his pursuers it was im-
possible for him to get above the fort for
as soon as he went out of sight in the
grove a line of guards wasstrung all along
from the fort to the river bank and another
string of men along the main drive between
the fort and the city all this made it
pretty sure that he must be still in the long
piece of woods which lay between the fort
and the city

escape seemed impossible

  guards were doubled and the  police
of neighboring towns were brought into
service it seemed that malone must lie
caught even if he were a rabbit all night
the big posse hunted and all the next day
until well into the afternoon-and still
malone was not caught every one was
worn out so a strong guard was left at
points where the alarm could be given
should he be seen

   when the first shock of excitement was
 over the officers of the fort held a council
 with mrs buell as it became clear that
 malone was not to be found at once as
 was so confidently expected at first mrs
 buell caused notices to be posted that she
 would give a reward of  to the naan
 who captured him

   the next day the state of kansas offered

 si more and to this the government
 added still  in all  was the
 reward for any one who would bring ma-
 lone in dead or alive

   the heartbroken wife left for her home
 with her husbands body as day after
 day passed and there seemed no prospect of
 arresting malone the excitement died out
 but the tireless search went on

   in the early evening of the ninth day one
 of the soldiers named kelly while on his
 way to the fort after a leave of absence
 stepped down from the railroad track to
 get a drink of water from a spring after
 drinking kelly stretched himself on the
 grass to rest

the whisper in the bushes

   as he jay there he heard a rustle in the
 bushes he did not stand up but lay still
 listening being off duty he was un-
 armed

   for a time all was still kelly began to
 think diat his imagination had played him
 a trick and he settled down again when in
 a hoarse whisper he heard-kelly

   startled yet cool he answered what
 is it what do you want at the same
 time jumping to his feet it struck him
 that it was malone whose voice he knew
  well he waited alnd listened for an-
 other call but heard nothing

   those who knew malone declared that
 he would not be taken alive if he had time
 to fight all knew him to be well armed
 and as every man is supposed to have his
 cartridge box filled when undergoing in-
 spection on dress parade he had plenty of
 ammunition to accost him unarmed
 meant sudden death

   the man at the spring standing there
 weaponless felt that he was standing in
 full sight of the desperate man who from
 his pla-ce of concealment could shoot him
 down should he deem it best for his own
 safety

   it is not pleasant to be under the trig-
 ger-yet kelly kept his nerve
a frontier man-hunt



  again he called who is it calls
me and what is it you want

  no doubt malone was hungry he
had now been in hiding nine days and
nights and it was hardly possible he
had eaten much

  it is a fact that malone from his
hiding-place saw kelly and his first
impulse was to trust him to name a
point of meeting and have him bring
him something to eat but after call-
ing something in kellys actions
warned the outlaw that the soldier
would betray him and lie changed his
mind

  kelly turned to go up the path to the
railroad malone was anxious to de-
stroy any idea that he may have cre-
ated in kellys mind that he had called
to him malone did not relish the
thought of another close searching
party he ran back while kelly had
his back turned and when he thought
a proper distance separated them dis-
guised his voice and spoke in broken
german asking  how var vas it yet
to dot fort

  kelly stopped looked back but see-
ing no one said mile and a half 
where are you  	he

  malone replied  i vas up near dis
road in deni bushes dont you see
me yet already say now vat you dink
me could enlist if i go oup dere 

  kelly now knew that malone was talk-
ing to him but had the presence of mind
to keep it to himself he answered care-
lessly oh yes i do see you now i
think but your coat looks so much like the
brown dirt in the bank behind you i did
not see you at first as to joining the serv-
ice if you are the right age height and so
forth i guess it will be no trouble to join
better come along with me i am going
back to the fort now

  as he said this kelly scrambled up the
steep path to the railroad and down the
other side to the river bank he did this
to get out of range of malones gun for
as he told it afterward he could feel
jacks eyes on him

  hearing no more of malone kelly made
good time to the fort and reported all to
his first sergeant he was then taken to
the officer of the day to whom he related
his story

  all was excitement again a large squad
of men were ordered down on the double-

vvas ordered to carry a heavy log on his
shoulder four hours on and two off

quick to the cottonwood spring but be-
fore they arrived there it was dark

  a big culvert ran under the railroad em-
bankment near the spring through which
ran a small creek that followed a gully
from the big hills behind the fort along
this gully was very thick brush in which
though it had been pretty well explored
before malone was possibly lurking

  but there was no malone all was dark
and silent as ever all through the night
the other guards lay waiting in the wet
grass along each side of this gully

roachs silent comrade

  about one hour before daylight sergeant
roach while patroling near the river was
hailed by another guard in a whisper say-
ing is there any sign of malone yet

  no he answered 

  then the two kept on down the gully
until coming to a picket post they were
challenged for the countersign the word
was given by the sergeant the other man
standing near enough to catch it


the railroad mans magazine

  while the sergeant stood talking to the
man on picket the stranger muttered some
excuse then kept on down the gully toward
the river as he passed on the picket
said to roach   who is that man  
dont know too dark to see his face
replied roach

  wasnt he with you i swear there
is something up did you notice he did
not speak and kept in the background

   and the voice  added roach  when
he spoke he seemed to smother his words
halt there halt they both shouted
but got no answer

   listening they could distinctly hear the
hurrying footsteps going down the creek

   if i was not  post here i would try
to overtake that njan again said the
picket  for i believe that one minute ago
jack malone stood right there

  my god exclaimed roach if that
is so i have been walking with him and
i helped him to get out of the trap
go interrupted the picket hurry
maybe you are not too late yet

  sergeant roach started to run plunging
along so that when he was challenged by
the next picket and not hearing the call
the first time he was nearly fired on

malone dropped down on one knee took deliberate
aim and fired

  on coming up and giving the counter-
sign he panted have you seen any one
which way did he go

  yes said the otiier picket one of the
boys went by a minute ago heading toward
the river

  did he give the countersign

   of course he did or  would not let
him pass

  sergeant roach hurried on after his late
companion and soon encountered the last
picket between himself and the river con-
sulting him roach found that the mysteri-
ous man had been there and gone on to the
river

  what did he say to you asked
roach

   said he had special orders to take a
post on the bank of the river further down
toward the city said the picket

on a real scent

  the mysterious man had told roach a
different story and there was now noioubt
that he was jack malone

  the two soldiers went to the railroad
track it being but a short distance from
the last pickets post

  as they listened
they could hear the
patter of feet up the
track-the man was
running

  so sure were they
that it was the as-
sassin that they
shouted not getting
any response they
fired up the track

  this alarmed the
searching party in
the neighbor-
liood many rushed
to join roach and
the picket roach
followed the fleeing
man firing as he
went others fol-
lowed but malone
must have slipped
down the dump and
hid in the bushes be-
tween the railroad
and the river and let
sergeant roach pass
him once more he
had disappeared
a frontier man-hunt



  fires were built all
along the bank of the
river the alarm reached
the fort and all turned
out the grove was full
of men day soon
dawned and men with
guns could b seen ev-
erywhere the excite-
ment was intense if
a shot was heard all
would rush to the spot

this state - of affairs
lasted until nine oclock
in the morning

  at this time the
railroad bridge across
the missouri river near
the fort was in course
of construction one of
the iron piers on the
kansas side near the
fort about two hun-
dred feet from shore
had fallen ancl a big
bell-boat the  subma-
rine no  was
anchored in the stream
working on the fallen
pier the crew on this
boat were on the cabin
deck watching the sol-
diers on shore an old fisherman named
williams was sitting in his skiff drifting
down the stream watching his lines

the voice in the darkness

  not being in the man-hunt i was by
the wrecked pier walking along the rail-
road i accosted two young men standing
near a rowboat that belonged to another
wrecking vessel that was anchored in the
middle of the river

  these two men members of the wreck-
ing crew had brought their captain ashore
and were waiting until he should get ready
to go aboard again seeing that i was a
soldier they hailed me and wanted a de-
scription of malone they said that three
nights running a man had called to them
for some one to come ashore and row him
over the river	

  i talked with the men for some time and
made up my mind that malone was the
man who had been calling to them in the
night

tapped his spencer carbine signifi-
cantly and shook his finger at me

                   as i looked up the
river i saw the old fel-
low williams sitting
in his fishing boat drop-
ping down with the cur-
rent his lines out for
fish it was reported
that he had seen ma-
lone drown while try-
ing to swim the river

  i made up my mind
to ask him about it i
walked along to get
nearer and beckoned to
him to pull into the
shore he dfd not no-
tice me he seemed to
be looking intently down
the stream i looked in
the direction of his eyes

  there was jack ma-
lone

  for a moment i could
not believe my eyes
yet there he was
crouched under a little
bush

 when he saw me
looking at him he put
his fingers to his lips
then tapped his spen-

	cer carbine significantly
and shook his finger at me in a threatening
manner

  being a cavalryman i have always had
great admiration for the spencer carbine
but just then my respect for the one in
jack malones hands was something pro-
found i was on my way to the city on
a twenty-four hour pass and so i was
unarmed

  to make a move toward the desperate
man against such odds would have been
suicide i did just what malone wanted
me to- nothin

  i looked at malone and malone looked
at me as he sat watching me and also
keeping an eye on old williams i noticed
that he was dressed differently than when
he ran by me out of the fort

  at that time he wore a dress coat and
cap he now had on a common fatigue
blouse and a campaign hat the brass
buttons were gone from the blouse across
his knees instead of the long infantry
needle-gun with which he had killed gen-
eral buell he had a spencer carbine


the railroad mans magazine

  when the old fisherman came down op-
posite him malone spoke in a low quick
voice telling him to pull in and ferry him
over the river this was part of the old
mans business but he declined on account
of his fish lines saying he would lose
them malone said

    i will give you two dollars for the job
and vou can easily overtake vour fishing
lines-

jumps into the boat

  the lines were attached to - air-tight
cans malones offer had the desired ef-
fect letting go the lines williams guided
his boat inshore little knowing the awful
character of the passenger he was about to
take on board

  as the stern of the skiff grated on the
sand malone stood up stretched his
cramped legs stepped in and quyekly seat-
ed himself in the stern he ordered the
old man to pull for the bell-boat his idea
was this if he could get the big boat be-
tween himself and the shore he was leav-
ing his chances of escape would be very
much better

  being out of range of the spencer car-
bine i started up the river-bank as i
gained the railroad i saw the grove full
of armed soldiers some running others
peeking into and under every bush and
possible hiding-place

  it was evident that some one besides my-
self had seen the hunted man and given the
alarm at this moment some one yelled
there he is there he is

  malone in full view and range was
crouched up double in the boat in one
hand he held the carbine with the muz-
zle within ten inches of the poor old fish-
ermans heart with the other he was
-leering the boat so as to put the wreck-
ing vessel between him and the men  the
bank

  volley after volley burst out from the
bank but the boat in spire of all went on
untouched

  one of the officers yelled  silence 
then he shouted to williams

  old man that fellow in your boat is
tack malone who killed general buell
turn your skiff inshore we do not wish
to kill you if you do not you must
take jour chances

  all this time malone said to the fisher-
man 

   the first move you make toward the
kansas shore i will blow the heart out of
you 

  the old man was as white as chalk he
was scared so bad that he could hardly
hold the oars he knew it was sure death
to disobey the desperate man in the boat
yet at any instant both of them would
probably be riddled from the shore but
of the two malones carbine was the most
dangerous so he kept on rowing

  it was pitiful to see that feeble old man
tugging at the oars the agony on his face
could be seen plainly by the crew of the
bell-boat whose captain joe snodgrass
ordered to stand out of danger from the
shower of bullets

  the water near the skiff was in a bubble
from the bullets every moment it was
expected that the men in the skiff would be
shot to pieces but on they went

  the officers swore at the soldiers and
declared that they were not trying to hit
the murderer they grabbed the muskets
from the soldiers hands ordered men to
stand while they rested die guns on their
shoulders for a better aim

  then they hit the skiff and all arouifd
it they even brought a trickle of blood
down the old rowers ghastly face but the
boat went  as if it were armor-clad

between two fires

  the soldiers were now frantic some
ran up-stream to the boat-house to procure
more boats while others fired faster than
ever

  the skiff was now in the swift current
made by the anchored bell-boat it swung
down and around the stern of the big
craft then passed behind it out of sight
and range

  with others not in the chase i scram-
bled to the top of the pier of the bridge
there i had a complete view of the other
side of the river and of the skiff and its
two passengers malone must have had a
charmed life although not over two hun-
dred yards away when the firing began he
had succeeded in getting the bell-boat be-
tween him and the shore without his
being hit

  malone now allowed the old man to take
it more easy from their movements it
could be seen that he was undecided just
which way to steer-up or down the river
or make a landing
a frontier man-hunt



  big timber and safety were just ahead
but between him and it were four men
sawmill hands from slab city

  they had heard the firing they had been
watching the chase and knew their man
and the reward on his head but malone
was well armed a good shot cool and des-
perate death was behind him and the
four sawmill hands were nothing to him
malone had just defied a regiment but now
only three men cared to close with him

at the waters edge

  these men were the two reymond broth-
ers who owned the sawmill at slab city
and one of their employees they ran to
the shore and then walked along so as to
meet malone when his boat landed

  the fugitive made an attempt to land
but some move by the three men made him
change his mind and he steered the boat
so as to get a range on them without being
in danger of hitting old man williams

  even in his own deadly peril malone
had no wish to see the old man hurt he
sought to keep him
out of danger as much
as possible yet he
would have killed him
instantly himself if
it had been neces-
sary to aid his es-
cape for one mo-
ment the frightened
fisherman stopped
rowing but malone
raised the carbine and
ordered him ahead

  as the boat neared
the bank the rey-
monds spoke words
of encouragement to
malone which threw
him off his guard

  the hunted man
stood up to leave the
skiff one of the rey-
monds suddenly
whipped out a hidden
revolver and fired

  he was not more
than fifteen or twenty
feet from malone and
tie bullet went true

  malone swayed un-
steadily for several
moments and tried to

   	r r

raise the carbine but toppled over back-
ward

  the reymonds fired again rushed into
the water grabbed the boat and struck the
fallen man in the head with a revolver as
he made a last attempt to rise

  malone lay still they lifted him-one
by the feet the other under the armpits-
and carried him onto the bank

  one of the reymond brothers turned to
the old fisherman and shook his hand
except a bullet tear along the left side of

tried to raise the carbine but toppled over backward


the railroad mans magazine

his face the ugly scar of which he carried
to his grave the exhausted old man was
unharmed the reymonds then hoisted the
limp man on their shoulders and started
on a dog-trot up the river-bank until they
reached the railroad depot opposite the
fort then they put their prisoner into a
skiff to avoid all the other bpats and
placed him in the hospital

jack malones last hours

  malone was dumped on the floor the hos-
pital steward made a hasty examination
and found two bullet wounds one through
the left lung and one in the neck either
would prove fatal a bad cut on the top
of his head showed where the butt of the
revolver had landed

  the reymond brothers hurried over to
the adjutants office for their money

  the post doctor seeing the wounded
prisoner on the hospital floor said take
this carrion out of my office 

  malone looked up at the doctor and with
a bitter smile said something so low that
he was not understood

  they took him to the guard-house there
the dying man was placed on a board bunk
and to his old comrades who crowded
around him he told some astonishing things

  without betraying any one he made it
clear that all the rumors about his being
seen in and around the fort on nights after
the tragedy were correct it was in this
way that he changed his gun and clothes
he even had been into his own barrack-
room and secured an undershirt and a
change of socks from his bunk

  to do this it was not necessary to pass a
guard as the posts were not very close to-
gether yet for a man who had a price on his
head for killing a ltnited states general
who was being hunted by hundreds of
men to go into the very heart of the fort
not once but three times and even to his

own bunk and out again seems more than
passing strange

  his hiding place during the day was a
little hole between two big stones in the
woods not over half a mile below the fort
afterward we visited it at first sight
it did not seem possible that a man could
conceal himself in so small a place but the
stone had a sharp shelf and malone by-
lying at full length could slide in so as
to be entirely concealed there he could
sleep quite comfortable while the whole
country hunted him

wanted a second victim

  at two different times malone joined in
the chase with the others when by lring
still he would have been captured

  but lie could not get a boat to cross the
river in-the night and he could not swim

  when asked why he did not make great-
er efforts to get away in the darkness of the
night he answered that he did not care to
live with a price on his head it was gath-
ered from what he said that his intention
was to kill another officer in the fort before
being taken then to show himself and get
killed by resisting arrest as he would not
be taken alive and stand for trial and exe-
cution

  although he did not give the name of the
second officer he wanted to kill it was sup-
posed from his dying talk in the guard-
house that it was the doctor who insulted
him while lie was lying wounded on the
floor and who refused to aid him in his
agony under the tree

  he regretted killing general buell and
said if he had been left in the guard-house
after the punishment for one night he never
would have done it he claimed that the
suffering all that hot july day with the
flies and mosquitoes made him crazy at
one oclock in the morning jack malone
died

portable electric station

to send a heavy electric current over a long
distance requires a heavy wire and copper
costs money power companies therefore distribute
current over large areas by transmitting it at high
voltage but low current to points where needed
and then change it to low voltage in what are
called  sub-stations after which it goes out over
other wires to customers an interesting portable

sub-station built by the westinghouse company
is now in operation on the lines of the fort
wayne and wabash valley traction company
the whole equipment being contained in an all-
steel car forty feet long whenever curreiu is
needed in construction-work the car is sent out
and connection made to a high voltage-line instead
of the trolley-wire-popular electricity

by augustus wittfeld

         carlock bjones detective does some inventing
         as well as sleuthing with the customary results

s chronicler of the remarkable
achievements of carlock
bjones the talented de-
tective of the pole-to-
pole railway i am con-
scious that the public will
not stand for any flirting with the god-
dess of fiction neither will it tolerate
any wildly improbable tales of impossible
adventure

  consequently as historian of the great
detective i am compelled to omit many
tilings which i know to be true but which
the public through its ignorance of crime
would stigmatize as fiction-faking and
consign me to the oblivion which seems
to be the limbo of the too-truthful or too-
accurate biographer 

  rather than offend by overestimating the
publics credulity i will eliminate all
seemingly impossible adventures from
these chronicles but shall reserve the right
of making them as forceful as is consist-
ent with a reputation for veracity

  the following which i have compiled
from data in my note-book exhibits the
great detective in a new light

  i pushed the button of carlocks an-
nunciator at one-thirty and again pushed
it impatiently at one-thirty-and-a-quarter
at one-thirty-sixteen carlocks voice
floated down the tube	

  ah watchem come up

  in my astonishment i swallowed my
impatience and taking the lift i was soon
in carlocks apartments i found him
leaning over a table in the center of his
chemical laboratory

  ah watchem he said you are in
a hurry what train are you thinking of
taking to the muttonhead race-track
with difficulty i caught my breath

which his sudden question had knocked
completely out of me

   how do you know that i am going to
the race-track   i gasped

   dead easy he replied  i know you
are in a hurry by the way you pushed the
button you are never in a hurry unless
you are seeking pleasure your only form
of pleasure seems to be in picking the
horses that can run away with your money
consequently you are bound for mutton-
head bay

   marvelous i commented  per-
haps you can tell me what horse i have
picked

  with a brain like yours watchem
he replied you are incapable of picking
anything but a loser now if you want
to put your money on a winner i would
advise that you invest it in this remark-
able discovery i have just made take it
from me its got the hundred-to-one shots
looking like the discard in a poker game
what is the nature of this great dis-
covery carlock   i asked

  watchem he replied  you have
often scoffed at my assertion that some
day i would make a discovery which
would astound the scientific world and
make the achievements of the master
minds of chemistry look like two bits and
a nickel as you pushed the annunciator-
button i had just brought to a success-
ful termination the work  which i have
been engaged in a short time the scien-
tific world will be endeavoring to grasp
the full significance of my discgvery
what have you discovered carlock
i asked

  watchem he replied i have dis-
covered a compound which possesses the
most remarkable property known or rather

 


the railroad mans magazine

unknown to chemistry i have blazed a
way along an unthought path while the
reputed master minds of science have
groped for the perfection of illusive ideas
i have pursued my researches along this
one line to you watchem shall belong
the proud honor of being the first to know
of my discovery

   of course as my biographer the
honor is rightly yours nevertheless it is
an honor of which you should be proud
when in future years the world pays a
tardy debt of recognition to my genius
and you watchem are reaping your re-
ward in the royalties which your  chron-
icles  will bring the world at large will
remember the great carlock bjones for
his unparalled work in criminology but
the scientific world will remember him
and reverence his name for this one great
discovery

   carlock i appealed  cant you stop
throwing confetti at yourself sufficiently
long to put an end to the suspense i am
suffering and tell me what you have dis-
covered  

   i have discovered said carlock im-
pressively  a compound which possesses
the most remarkable attraction or affinity
for alcohol

  great guns carlock i commented
 you dont have to hunt for anything like
that in a chemical laboratory why i
just turned down an alcoholic affinity who
tried to work me for the medium where-
with to consummate a union of the ele-
ments

  seriously watchem said carlock
this discovery is something phenomenal
its magnitude overwhelms me when i
think of the possibilities of this discovery
in a perfected state i realize that i have
something which will revolutionize life

  how does the substance work i
asked interrupting carlocks rhapsody in
i major no flats

  let me demonstrate to you replied
carlock holding up a wide-mouthed
glass-stoppered bottle this jar contains
a white powder as you can see place the
jar in the same room with a botde or ves-
sel containing alcohol either absolute or
diluted to the limit and uncork both bot-
tles in less time than it takes to tell the
alcohol will have entirely disappeared

  say carlock i protested im not
from saint looey but all the same id
appreciate an ocular demonstration

  that is what i propose giving you
he replied

  he took a bottle of alcohol and poured
four ounces into a graduate replacing
the cork in the bottle he next poured the
alcohol into a small earthen dish or cap-
sule then he placed the jar containing
the powder on the scales and weighed it

   exactly two pounds including the
stopper he announced when i re-
move the stopper from the jar i shall place
it on the scales with the jar so that the
weight will remain unchanged are you
ready for the demonstration

   i am i replied  proceed with your
mysteries

  keep your eye on the alcohol in-
structed carlock deftly removing the
stopper and placing it on the scales

  i watched the alcohol closely almost
immediately it seemed to grow less in vol-
ume in less than a minute i was gazing
at the empty capsule

  what has become of it i asked
whats the trick

  no trick at all replied carlock
you will note that the weight of the pow-
der and jar remains the same the pow-
der attracts the alcohol but does not absorb
it otherwise its weight would be increased
by four ounces

  but what has become of it i per-
sisted

   it has been destroyed dissipated into
the atmosphere replied carlock

  but whats the use i asked i
dont see the utility of a substance which
destroys but does not produce it seems
to me that you have a gnld-brik on your
hands

  not necessarily replied carlock
even as it stands there is a diversity of
uses to which it might be put carried
to the point of the perfection i have in
mind this substance could be taken into
the fields and with appropriate apparatus
i could extract the alcohol directly from
the growing grain and store it in con-
tainers

  to your unscientific mind this may
sound like an idle boast but you have only
to look at the achievements of recent years
to realize that seeming impossibilities are
being accomplished daily in a very few
years carlock bjoness alcohol extractor
will be recognized by science and hold an
established place in the world

   and carlock bjones will be posing as
the alcohol

annihilator



a rival to petroleum v rockefeller and
trying to devise ways and means to get rid
of his ill-gotten gains

   and you watchem as my biographer
will be investing in a biograph machine to
keep up with the pace

   say carlock i said suddenly struck
with an idea  how would you like to try
a novel experiment with your great dis-
covery

   what kind of experiment   he asked

   ill hunt up that  souse  i spoke of
a while ago i replied  if i find him
ill bring him up here and we will test
your wonderful discovery and see whether
it will relieve him of his jag if it is a
success you could open up an office and do
a big business unloading the victims of con-
viviality

  watchem said carlock once in a
decade or so that brain of yours does pro-
duce an original thought go and find
the subject and we will make the experi-
ment in the interest of science

  i left carlocks apartments and had no
difficulty locating the souse and pre-
vailing on him to accompany me to his
doom when i ushered him into car-
locks apartments his condition was so
obvious that the great detective refrained
from making any of his deductions

  what kind of a joint is this asked
the souse got anything to drink

  carlock opened a cupboard and took
from it a bottle of whisky and glasses
he placed them on the table and invited
the victim to offer up a sacrifice on the
altar of bacchus the souse filled his
glass and sighed because there was no more
room for filling carlock and i poured
out homeopathic doses and we did the
tipplers trio

  pretty slick stuff said the souse
insinuatingly

   yes said carlock placing the alcohol
annihilator on the table have an-
other

   i dont care if i do replied the
souse	-

  he poured himself another drink as car-
lock removed the stopper from the jar
by the time he raised the glass to his lips
carlocks alcohol magnet had taken all the
stiffness out of it and a puzzled expression
crossed his face as he gulped it down

  what kind of a temperance beverage is
this youre ringing in on me he asked

  its out of the same bottle as the other

drink answered carlock  is there any-
thing the matter with it

  is there anything the matter with it
repeated the souse why that stuff
has lost its nationality-its neither scotch
irish bourbon nor plain american i
didnt come up here to be made a guy of
and he lapsed into silence

  carlock and i watched him with interest
awaiting evidence of the efficiency of the
alcohol annihilator presently he  began
to lose his bloated alcoholic appearance
and his bleary eyes became brighter

  as the alcohol was drawn from his satu-
rated system and brain he seemed to un-
dergo a metamorphosis in less than five
minutes the souse who had entered
rum-soaked sodden and maudlin sat be-
fore us a perfect specimen of manhood

    how in the blazes did i get rid of that
beautiful bun i was carrying he asked

   i had not noticed that you were carry-
ing any bakery product said carlock

   sure i was he replied  maybe you
thought it was a load of peaches or that
i was full of prunes the fact is i was
burdened with a most beautiful jag-
 j-a-g jag synonyms souse pickled
bun skate where is it whos got it
my dear fellow said carlock per-
haps you have mislaid or spilled it if
you had it when you entered you should
have it now neither watchem or myself
has any use for a second-hand jag i as-
sure you if you must persist in drink-
ing you should study professor boozems
 how to take care of a jag when you
get one it is my opinion that you are
a novice in the art a rank amateur
the ex-tank looked at carlock as though
he half believed him then looking at the
jar of alcohol annihilator suspiciously
picked up his hat and departed

   say carlock i remarked when we
were alone  that was the slickest thing i
ever witnessed youve got the temperance
reformers beat to a fringe the way you
robbed that poor inebriate of his rightful
jag was a shame why dont you use your
great discovery for the redemption of such
cases and give up the idea of using it for
production of alcohol  

  watchem replied carlock you are
not a scientist consequently you cannot
appreciate the lure of an idea to a scien-
tist the conception of an idea is the birth
of a new existence

  no watchem i cannot renounce what


the railroad mans magazine

is to me an alluring proposition i would
be glad to use it as you suggest but that
would necessitate letting the scientific world
into my secret and the time is not yet ripe
for a move of that kind

  i backed toward the door knowing that
when carlock waxed monologuistic it was
me for the maddening crowd

   ill see you in the morning i called
as i dodged out of the door  im off

  i reached muttonhead race-track in time
for the last event by a juggling of the
fates i won fifty dollars i had intended
putting a fiver on  india rubber and
when i rushed up to the bookmaker i
thought i would save time by talking short-
hand so i asked for a ticket on  rubber
the bookie pushed the ticket toward me
parting with my money i pocketed the
pasteboard and rushed over to see the race

  as i squeezed into a point of vantage
the horses started i had no trouble in
locating  india rubber  who to my dis-
gust was trailing along as if he were
made of lead after the race the crowd
was yelling for rubberneck

  i took the ticket from my pocket in-
tending to destroy all evidence of my fool-
ishness when i discovered that fate and a
blundering bookmaker had done what tal-
ent and brains could not accomplish i
had staked my money on  india rubber
but i held a ticket for  rubberneck the
winner-a ten-to-one shot

  i cashed in and joyously returned to
the metropolis the next morning when
i stopped at carlocks apartments to tell
him the good news i found everything in
confusion the place had been burglar-
ized the night before and carlocks man
had found him insensible in the laboratory
he had put him to bed and a doctor found
that he was suffering from shock

  he had been struck on the head with
some blunt implement

  his wonderful vitality stood him in good
stead and he quickly recovered later
when i spoke to him of his great discovery
i was astonished to learn that all recol-
lection of it had faded from his mind and
strange to relate he showed absolutely no
interest in it

  the jar containing the annihilator had
been carried off by the burglars and it
was impossible to reproduce the compound

  as carlocks biographer it was up to
me to try and discover how and by whom
he had been robbed of his wonderful dis-

covery and knowing the futility of pro-
ceeding alone i tried to enlist carlocks
interest in the matter

  watchem he said i may as you
suggest have discovered a compound which
possessed die remarkable properties you
claim but as it has disappeared and all
recollection of it has faded from my mind
why should i waste time to recover it

   the chemical and scientific work in
which i indulge is performed with the one
end in view bioadening my knowledge
and making my mind more acute for the
problems of my profession

   for instance the alcohol annihilator
as you term it would be of absolutely no
assistance in helping me deduce the fact
that you are in the stock-market

    how in the world- do you know that  
 very simple answered carlock  the
elbow of the left sleeve of your coat is
worn shiny that can indicate but one
thing you have been using the telephone a
great deal as your duties do not require
that you use the gabby-gab machine we
must search for the cause of such activity

   frequent calls on the telephone indi-
cate an anxious mind anxiety about any-
thing is due to the fact that there are ever-
changing conditions present this condi-
tion we have in the stock-market the
fact that you no longer keep posted on cur-
rent events but can name the earnings
dividends and parboiled value of all rail-
road and industrial stocks can indicate but
one thing furthermore from the condi-
tion of your newspaper which is covered
with pencil memoranda any one can see
that you figure on margins

    as you can tell these things so easily
carlock i commented perhaps you can
name the stock i am carrying

    that replied carlock  is a cinch
you bought for a rise consequently you
thought you would pick out a sure thing
you are carrying  compressed yeast
common

    carlock i commented  there is no
use trying to deceive you if  compressed
yeast  acts as it should ill buy an auto-
mobile

   i walked over to the ticker which stood
in a corner of carlocks office looking
at the tape i was astounded  com-
pressed yeast had just broken ten points

    carlock i gasped  for once you are
wrong in your deductions i am not on
the stock-market
 grit of the eagle-eye

by arno dosch

when a railroader speaks of sand he doesnt always mean the kind that
an engine carries in her dome back of the smoke-stack there is another
kind of grit than that which the eagle-eye shoots under the wheels to
keep them from slipping and many followers of the iron trail have a supply of it
that never gives out nomatter how bad the rails or how steep the grade the
men mr dosch writes about didnt do any sliding they stuck to what they
considered their duty with the grip of sanded steel are they heroes read
about them and judge for yourself at any rate youll admit that their stories
are well worth repeating

joe johnsons last words-a pilot pick-up-how a train crew that
wouldnt quit met death in a dynamite wreck
in pennsylvania

that joe johnson had telegraphed in the
very face of death and when the last letter
was clipped in half each shivered as if he
had felt the blow that had fallen

  it was late and the operator at quakake
the station next below had leaned back to
read after turning tom beckert and the
late freight loose all the way to ringtown
when johnsons last word startled him in-
to a full realization of what was happening
he jumped to his feet and ran out on the
platform all he saw down the track were
the tail lights of the freight

  with that gone there was no other help
for an hour he returned to his instrument
there was only one thing left to do and
that was to catch the freight he quickly
put his message on the wire

   operator girard manor catch freight
and send it back to lofty to help johnson
in the few minutes that followed every
operator on the division sat over the soul-
less metallic companion of his solitude
and waited with limp lingers

  a halting jumble of dots and dashes
finally broke the silence of the wire it
came like the voice of a half-conscious man
and spelled out the words painfully



being-

   hey drop that key drop
it i say

  the words snapped out like
pistol-shots and an extra
punch from the muzzle of the
revolver against joe johnsons stomach ac-
centuated each one of them

   hands off i tell you i mean
business 

  in the desperados voice was that cutting
note men have who steel themselves to
murder his fingers worked on the trig-
ger in a way that made johnson wince but
the operator only raised his hand as if he
were warning a child to keep away

  the action was cool and authoritative
and his assailant drew back instinctively
it was but a moment but it gave the opera-
tor time to finish his message

  -robbed

  then the butt end of the revolver swung
down viciously over the back of his neck
and his body slumped across the desk in
the corner of the little depot at lofty 
die philadelphia and reading

  in nearly every other station and in every
tower on the division the operators knew


the railroad mans magazine

   robbers gone-jumped beckerts engine
-he doesnt know whats up-feeling bet-
ter-never mind me-catch robbers

  girard manor failed to answer all calls
for the next ten minutes and all knew the
operator was on the track with his lantern
waiting for beckert

  when the train stopped the two desper-
adoes were standing in the gangway talking
to the engineer like any other two men who
might have climbed aboard and made them-
selves at home their eyes were fixed on
him keenly however and as he caught sight
of the operators lantern one of them quick-
ly asked whats the matter

    nothing replied beckert undisturbed
 orders thats all

   oh thats all right whispered the
other as the speed slackened  i guess he
does that at all stations

   the first robber was satisfied at the ex-
planation but the suspicions of both were
immediately aroused when a paper flashed
to the cab window beckert reaching
down was even more surprised than they
when he looked into the excited face of the
operator who passed the flimsy to him with
the one word  orders

         reading the warning 

   holding the paper close to the gage-lamp
he scanned it carefully he read

    be careful as you read this dont look
surprised youre being closely watched
you have aboard two desperadoes who al-
most killed operator at lofty

  four gimlet eyes peered over beckerts
shoulder but he showed no signs of being
disturbed and as one of the robbers stepped
quickly toward him he carelessly twirled
the message out of the window

  the gimlet eyes turned sharply toward
the vanishing paper and a hand reached out
quickly as if to seize it

   what was that   asked the huskier of
the two who afterward gave his name as
george snyder

   order giving me a clear track

  his voice was dry and cracked and the
words rasped out suspiciously but he de-
liberately turned his back on the robbers
and went about his business it took nerve
to do it but he did not dare let them see
his face he could hear them whispering
even above the roar of the train and he
did not know at what minute he would re-
ceive a blow on the head

  

   they passed through brandonville and
 krebs without a stop and approached ring-
 town beyond that point beckert had no
 orders and yet if he stopped he knew the
 robbers would escape as they could easily
 overpower the operator and himself

a fight on the foot-plate

   as the station hove into view he saw a
 lantern beside the track and made out the
 figure of the operator he felt sure the
 orders were to go through so he hardly
 slackened his speed he leaned far out of
 the cab-window and pulled himself back
 again holding a paper in his hand this
 time he knew the robbers would be ready to
 read the message as soon as he opened it
 but he managed to stoop forward and make
 out

run for catawissa sheriff waiting

   a rough jerk on the arm brought him to
 his feet and the outlaw named snyder
 scowled down into his face

    give that to me he snarled but beck-
 ert swung around and just as the revolver
 flashed in his face let the message drop
 from the window

    stop the train roared snyder

   beckert glanced quickly to his fireman
 for help only to discover that he also was
 looking down the barrel of a revolver
 then with that same dogged courage that
 prompted joe johnson he put his hand to
 the throttle and instead of obeying the ban-
 dits harsh order flung it wide open
 knocking up snyders arm he hurled him
 off his feet to the floor and went down on
 top of him as he sprawled across the other
 mans body the second robber fell over
 them both while into the pile leaped the
 fireman like a football player in a
 scrimmage

into the trap

   the revolvers fell out of reach and while
 the struggle for them was still on the freight
 tore through rericks beaver valley and on
 to mainville within four miles of cata-
 wissa without a whistle to announce its
 passage each operator catching a quick
 silhouette of the fight as the engine went
 tearing by wired on ahead his version of
 how the combat stood to them it was
 more thrilling than any story they had ever
 read and each report left them in greater
 suspense dian the one before

at catawissa the sheriff and his depu-
grit of the eagle-eye



ties were strung out along the track ready
to make a flying leap for the train if
necessary

  when less than a mile from the station
beckert let snyder slip from his hands
the desperado reached for the throttle and
closed it too wary by this time to chance
passing through another town

  he did not know enough to use the air
however and the engine did not slacken
its speed until within a hundred yards of
the station snyder jumped he stumbled
and rolled over and over coming to a dead
stop only when the sheriff flung his weight
upon him at the same moment two depu-
ties swung aboard and nailed his com-
panion

saving a two-year-old

   this is one of the stories they tell on the
reading and there are many others as
good each with its accompaniment of ex-
citing details when the gang in the round-
house begins to tell them off you are free
to believe as much or as little as you please
but for the story of terrance cummings
two years old and an obstructer of traffic
anj one will vouch

  it happened on a branch of the jersey
central in eastern pennsylvania but it is
hard for any one to keep the reading
and the jersey central distinctly separated
except the auditors of the two companies
the two lines switch back and forth into
each other so often some of the men hardly
know which road is paying their wages

  cal kimberley however was not wor-
rying about this or any other matter as he
came twisting down the upper susquehanna
one day about six years ago with a light
passenger-train behind as he rounded a
curve he suddenly saw a little child sit-
ting on the track hardly three hundred feet
ahead it was a down grade and kimber-
ley knew he could not bring the train to a
stop before he struck the baby who sat
clapping his hands and playing as uncon-
cernedly as if he w-ere in his own back yard

  a cold chill ran through kimberley
throwing on the air quick as a flash he
slipped out of the cab onto the running-
board and mde his way forward to the
pilot he did not know what he was go-
ing to do but he had some wild notion of
leaping out as the speed slackened and seiz-
ing the child quickly in his arms

even before he reached the pilot he knew

he would not be able to do this and keep
ahead of the engine the train was not
slowing down quickly enough

  then to cal kimberley there came a sud-
den idea one which added another daring
feat to the list of those which had already
been accomplished by nervy trainmen

  twisting one leg about the socket of the
signal flag he swung down head first
grasping the cow-catcher with one hand
while with the other he reached down quick-
ly as the train was abut to pass over the
baby and lifted him out of danger

  it was not all over however the train
was still moving and kimberley hardly
able to hold himseli up encountered a diffi-
culty he had not anticipated mr ter-
rance cummings two years old was wroth
at being disturbed

  he had not asked to be moved and to
be hoisted up in that unexpected manner
ruffled his feelings he squirmed and
twisted and kicked until kimberley thought
his arm would break

  woo-ow screamed terrance with an-
other well-aimed kick and kimberley at
the very end of his endurance suddenly felt
his foot slip as he lurched forward how-
ever he gave a shove flung terrance into
the ditci and rolled over beside him

the dynamite wreck

  if you want to get them to talking on
the jersey central ask about the bad night
they gave the town of ashley pennsylvania

  ashley is a quiet little village and never
got badly excited but once but it hasnt got
over that yet you will hear the old-timer
there still saying

   i was winding the kitchen clock i
remember that because i carried that in-
fernal clock all over town with me the rest
of the night and didnt know i had it

   what was it   you ask  an earth-
quake  

  on the jersey central that night has not
been forgotten and plenty of the boys can
still tell you about john rheig who stuck
by his post and lost his life

  frank mclaughlin was the first to real-
ize what was coming they had hardly
struck the grade below mauch chunk when
he felt the slack in the cars and realized
that the brakes were not holding it was
ten years ago before the general use of
air and there was none on his train all
at once it struck mclaughlin what car he


the railroad mans magazine

was standing on and jumping as if he
had set his bare feet on a red-hot stove he
gingerly made his way forward setting
brakes as he ran

riding with death

  sulfur and fire i dont mind he said
to himself  but that way of going to
perdition is a little too sudden for me

  he dropped down on the tender and
made his way into the cab

  what you doing to us to-night john
he asked the engineer

  were sliding thats all i know an-
swered rheig  and well never stop her
on this grade maybe well pile up a car
or two in the yard at ashley but it wont
do much harm

  wont eh frank asked do you
know whats in that first box car there  

   no what  

   dynamite

  then rheig began to take a new interest
in the slack and every time the couplings
pounded he held his breath in a minute
mike bird die rear brakeman came run-
ning over the top with the same message v
but mclaughlin starting back over the
tops waved him off

  they ran for miles couplings pounding
at every jump and it seemed to frank mc-
laughlin as if that dynamite car would
be shaken to pieces its brakes were the
worst of all and he took the most of the
ride with the sound of the jolting boxes of
explosive right under his feet

  down the mountain they came brakes
shrieking whistles blowing bells ringing
and the dynamite banging around ready at
any instant to blow the whole train into
the next county for a second time it got
to be too much for mclaughlin and he came
down over that latent volcano white as a
sheet

listen to it rattling john he cried

 cut and run for it were dead ones if
we stay

  no you dont rheig shouted in an-
swer  just leave it to me im getting on
to her curves and ill have her going like
a lamb before we hit ashley if they only
knew down there what were bringing them
theyd give us the right of way straight in-
to jersey city

  though rheig made light of the situa-
tion he fully realized the danger he was
running the grade dipped just below and

in a minute they were plunging down the
mountain harder than ever and he thought
he heard the dynamite boxes himself be-
low there was a short level stretch and then
ashley

   get back over there and make for die
caboose he yelled into mclaughlins ear
the brakeman started back but not for the

caboose

  he was no coward and he decided he
could stick it out if rheig could

  the lights were out in ashley except
around the depot two engines were
slowly churning along the main line un-
conscious of the imminent catastrophe
rheig suspected their presence and tried
to give warning to the men in their cabs
but the roaring death was on them all in
an instant

what ashley saw

  the rest of the story is ashleys the
town was in its first sleep when rheig
still struggling to control the runaway train
plunged through the yards and crashed into
the engines knocking them both from the
track

  then came the explosion

  woof boom letters the size of this
page would not express what that ex-
plosion meant to ashley the jar that
followed shook the whole town out of bed
amid a rain of crashing glass as every win-
dow went to pieces even in pittston three
miles away the people made for the street
in a panic

  the air was still reverberating from the
shock when ashleys population began to
hit the street in whatever costume lay
nearest at hand and as rheig lay dying
in his cab the last thing he saw was this
motley crew of townspeople streaking it
down the street as if their lives depended
on it

  they fell to on the wreck just as they
were many of them shoeless some only
in their shirts but they worked all night
as they were five engines had been blown
to pieces and everything else in range had
been knocked askew they took rheig to
the hospital and found the bodies of frank
mclaughlin and mike bird who had stood
by the brakes to the end although they
might have saved themselves by retreat-
ing to the caboose in die morning die
rescuing party had to send for clothes to
wear home

        fate hands our two old friends a
        lemon and the swan sings at valhalla

any varied and eccentric
  are the ways in which you
  get the little yellow ovoid
  fruit with the acrid taste
  handed to you in this
  whirligig world of adul-
  terated foodstuffs adventures and vicissi-
  tudes yes many and

varied are the ways	-

  life is a whole lot
of an odd - come -
short about the time
you get your lid
firmly settled on your
devoted dome and
shuffle up to grab the
hand-rail of opportu-
nity preparatory to a
long pleasant trip
through the land of
easy money a clinker
rolls under the ball
of your foot and its
you for the road-bed
edgewise

 honk says i am
prone to pessimism
indigestion ingrati-
tude and foibles eve-
ry so often maybe
so still theres
worse guys than me
that have pie every
meal

  what have i done
that  cant joy-ride
through life a little
and hear the bul-bul
sing ive never
robbed no poor wid-
ow woman nor killed
no kids with a club

and i pay my bills-if ive got the price
what the-but ah beg pardon im sure

  i forgot that you didnt know about it
im a bit unstrung yet like a fiddle after
die dance as it were the p and p rail-
road has treated honk and me pretty roy-
ally these last few years theyve let us
do as we please and
coughed up regular-
ly both salary and
expenses

weve run our lit-
tle end of the game
according to our own
ideas and it has evi-
dently panned out
pay-dirt for the com-
pany else wed heard
about it before this
but nothing is a
cinch around a rail-
road not even the
railroad itself

the p and p has
been gobbled we got
to making too much
money and showing
up too strong on the
financial reports

 series began in the november  railroad hans

                                       

 i got my time this morning

magazine single copies jo centi


the railroad mans magazine

id watch them whisk the sacks up from the depot and follow my
face illumined with high hope

what all that traffic profit going into the
pockets of the unanointed hey-day and
tut-tut its all right for the ordinary peo-
ple of this country to have a good time and
enjoy themselves but money is not a matter
of sentiment so the transcontinental just
took a sponge and dabbed it on the map and
absorbed the p and p same as a book-
keeper removes a gob of ink from his ledger
with a new blotter

  you know what happens when a railroad
company changes management you dont
that fellow over there with the hunted look
says he does all right they clean house
dont they you bet me and the old-
timers get theirs dont they some of them
at least they do

  a snatch of poetry occurs to me when i
think about the affair

    ah distinctly i remember it was on a bleak
       december

  it was cool weather even in valhalla
honk devoted soul always alert and on

poetry now i might as well do so before
i forget it

   each separate dying ember wrought its
      ghost upon the floor

  i wasnt seeing spooks particularly i
was smoking an old missouri meerschaum
pipe of tender memory though a bit husky
as to throat and given to gutturals and i
was reading a scientific treatise regarding
the startling adventures of one reade and
a steam-horse

  all unthoughtful unsuspecting and un-
prepared i sat in my sock feet poring over
my book with the phonograph peering over
my shoulder and the little brass teakettle
purring on the stove i was comfortable
and content hark our sounder clicks
it is my call i answer it is well i am
here horatius is at his post

  glibly come the fretful dots and dashes
a rhythmic stream of crowding symbols i
know that brass-pounder at the other end
he thinks hes a lightning-striker but-

the job had taken a party of capitalists on
a tour of the surrounding country-his and
my empire-in view of selling them a coun-
ty or two for the spring opening i sat be-
fore our little cast-iron heater in the medi-
cine house and-ill finish that snatch of
honk and horace



heavens whats this it was gossip pure
and simple but fraught with meaning

  he said that the p and p was defunct
we were dead and didnt know it at head-
quarters everything was shot to pieces
rumors hissed and whined over the wires
and dire dismayful forebodings skulked in
the shadows everything was going to be
revolutionized remodeled renovated and re-
constructed 

  sweeping and drastic reformswere to be
instituted no more tobacco on duty save
the whittlings from lead-pencils and use old
envelopes for scratch-paper retrenchment
and economy from john ogroats to lands
end a new regime from cellar to garret

  it didnt take the seventh son of a sep-
temtet to foresee what would happen ive
been present at some of these retrenchment
flurries before so in place of my rapt con-
templation of  the ghosts of dying embers
on the floor i turned my attention to the
handwriting on the wall and ill say this
my suspense was not long drawn out

  the morning motor brought a bulky
package - my package that fortune had
handed me fourteen mimeographed pages
of red tape rococo and raus mit em

  cut expenses and hedge was the watch-
word

  cultivate a light touch on the telegraph
instrument sos not to wear off the varnish

  be sparing with stationery

  stationery cost money and money was
scarce all lead-pencil stubs were to be
turned in before new ones would be sup-
plied and one typewriter ribbon was sup-
posed to last five years

  these were among the general instruc-
tions applicable to all when it got down
to valhalla specifically-ovv

  deeply as they must have regretted it
honk had been retained on the pay-roll
in return for that favor he had been ap-
pointed a committee of one whose duties
would be to do all the work at valhalla
from porter to passenger-agent he was to
be the whole curdle

  the medicine house would be returned
to the shops repainted refurbished and re-
placed in the service where it belonged
then followed the incendiary list-the
names of those fired

  it was lengthy and exhaustive it cov-
ered the ground thoroughly and lo  ben
adhems name led all the rest as a poet
who forgot to leave his address once said

  i was fired the torpedo had been at-

tached to me and exploded the can tied to
me proper my time was enclosed they
wished me well if i starved to death they
hoped id get off the transcontinental prem-
ises first not that they didnt like me but
they had other uses for the space

  of course it made me sore it makes
anybody sore to have this arson crime com-
mitted on their person but i had quit
gnawing the woodwork and settled down to
a slow boil when honk returned he came
in rubbing his hands and untroubled his
boasted clairvoyant sense hadnt hooked
him anything out of the charged air

  it so happens occasionally they said
napoleon was caught cracking jokes on the
morning of waterloo

  well he said i nailed em four
fat rascals with money and discernment
signed up theyre going to subdivide two
thousand acres of land into five and ten-
acre tracts to be sold for five dollars down
and fifty cents a week no interest no
taxes and water rights included in the pur-
chase price first excursion second tues-
day in march what are you doing
horace 

    im packing up my little traps i said
 me for the wildwood i got my time this
morning

  wha-at he cried show me im
from sedalia whatd you do who
canned you ptt huh ill letem know
whos boss around this dump where
is he 

  he peered out the window scowling

  keep your vest buttoned i advised
him  and glance over that the p and p
has fallen into the hands of the philip-
pines

  i pressed the documentary evidence into
his trembling clutch he read the sheets
one by one commenting betimes

  thunder huh fire and pestilence
the deuce-well ill be-whoever heard
of such-huh aw rats rotten curse
em a million maledictions on em lem-
me get to that wire-the latter as he fin-
ished and threw the sheets under the table

  there was no half-heartedness about the
uproar he instigated either they were
gathering up broken insulators along the
right-of-way of the transcontinental for a
week afterward and they said they hadnt
heard such sending at the headquarters of-
fice since the night willie the wizard had
the d ts they thought lightning had
struck somewhere along the line
	the railroad mans magazine

  he got answers too right away he got
an armload of em the new management
told him the exact location of the switch
where he was to take the siding and pull
his fire they cited him to a line of back
away back and muffle

   they impressed it upon him that he didnt
have a word to say that he was known at
headquarters by a number preceded by two
ciphers and that any say-so he might have
had formerly in the private powwows and
war conferences of the company had been

   i was still fired

  supper-time came and went unheeded
neither of us were hungry we sat up the
rest of the night and talked it over if the
new management of the road didnt toss and
tumble on their downy couches with burn-
ing ears that night on account of somebody
talking mean about em it was through no
fault or oversight of ours we read their
titles clear and wished em bad luck to i
finish

   i dont suppose now youve got any-
thing in view have you honk asked
just as the dawn was breaking

not just exactly i re-
turned  i guess ill drift

they took the medicine
hodse away

back east maybe i can get on the postal
or the western or a bucket-shop or some-
thing ive a notion to try for a wireless
job on some steamer

 i wouldnt be in any fidget said honk
 stick around here a while ill make these
people come through as soon as their fever
dies down a little id quit myself in the
morning if it wasnt for valhalla going to
the dogs just as weve got her on a firm
footing 

  i waitedtill his explosion had spent it-
self and the blue haze had cleared

   youre right i said with fervor  i
agree with you mans inhumanity to man
is the root of all evil and birds of a feather
gather no moss but im no guy to run after
em and try to lick the mitt that soaked me
im as independent as a hog on ice ill
see em in hoc sicysevipcr san jacinto first
id hate to think that was the only job there
is anyhow 

   ho-hum  sighed honk

   ill hang around here a day or two i
added at least until i can get an an-

corked up in a sealed tube and flung into
the most remote corner of the sargasso sea

they mentioned that the goat industry
had been discouraged all along the line
lately and hinted in so many words that
when any advice or suggestions as to run-
ning the road emanating from valhalla or
elsewhere seemed imperative they would
warn him a week or two in advance

  they remembered things to say after they
had finished and reopened the discussion
it was some quarrel-lasted till nearly mid-
night honk came out of it in a cold sweat
clear fizzled out and all hed accomplished
had been to exhaust himself
honk and horace



svver to some letters ill have to write if i
didnt have to make my own living id be
glad to stay here forever and watch you
work but i cant do it consistently

  he was either too sad or too sleepy to
vouchsafe a fitting reply to this bon mot

  that day i contributed materially to the
outgoing mail from valhalla by launching
a couple of dozen missives i also franked
about ninety-seven dollars day rate worth
of messages hither and yon there seemed
to be little doing

  one or two said they were sorry they
hadnt known about me the week before
there had been a hum-dinger of an opening
at so-andso etc but it was filled
now etc

  i had one chance to sub two weeks in a
brokers office at some jerkwater village on
the pumpkin vine route at the munificent
salary of thirty-five a month i turned it
down arrogantly then i went to bed and
slept the clock around a thousand bless-
ings on the man that first invented sleep

  honk tried to appear frolicsome and kit-
tenish when we foregathered at the festal
board that evening but his quips were off
tone our old comrade the phonograph
fell off the table by some mischance and
busted itself wide open most disastrously so
that thereafter its chatter was stilled

  the wintry wind yowled and mourned
around the coach and the windows rat-
tled  it wasnt cold particularly it didnt
get very crimpy in valhalla but the wind
had a bleak whang to it

  honk mentioned several wild and inco-
herent things i might do to achieve fortune
and fame without leaving valhalla from
running a box-ball alley to organizing a
trust company

  why dont you start a nursery hor-
ace   he proposed  theres a fine open-
ing here why you could clean up a thou-
sand on sweet potato plants this spring or
open up a pool hall that would suit you
to a t-y-ty-

  that was the haphazard way his mind
was warping back and forth like a bark-
entine with a broken rudder

  why not open up a radium factory

i returned  i wouldnt need to make but
a couple of pounds or so and then i could
retire and buy north and soutli america for
investments-

   a mysterious and wonderfully fasci-
nating substance horace he commented
vigorously  you know the black sands

along the pacific coast are rich in pitch
blende- and so on for an hour or two
honk was always set on a hair-trigger when
it came to a scientific discussion

   scientific discussions poetry grand opera
and sociology are all right to while away
time with when youre on your vacation up
in the catskills or cruising in your yacht on
the dark blue mediterranean but when a
hearty eater like me is the next thing to
broke in winter and knows that nowhere
in the world is his name recorded on a pay-
roll he is apt to lose interest in the topic
and fall to figuring abstractedly on how
long it is till the grass gets green again

    i wonder if i could deadhead it as far
as cleveland on a pinch i said inter-
rupting honk in the middle of the com-
pound word radio-activity  ive got a
brother-in-law there that runs a sausage
factory and hell give me a job skinning
dogs any day i drop in on him

   honk was too full for utterance

   within a couple of days i began to get
replies to my applications it is surprising
how many different ways there are in the
english language by which you can turn a
man down and not hurt his feelings the
most favored method it seems is placing
his application on file

   i have applications on file in nearly every
city in uncle sams domain nearly all
of them are indorsed and annotated so that
i am to be given a shot at the first vacancy
some day ill be swamped with jobs when
seventy-five or a hundred positions mature
on the same day

   the flood of mail quit coming after a few
days but i continued to appear regularly
at the post-office id watch them whisk
the sacks up from the depot and follow my
face illumined with high hope

   afterward id return drooping saddened
disconsolate there was a certain corner
where id turn into the home-stretch to the
medicine house and there my downcast
spirits would jevive and id look forward
brightly to die next mail again

   one thing occurred during this dark and
gloomy chapter in our lives which i view
in retrospect most tenderly my resources
had shrunk to one solitary well-thumbed
dog-eared ten-dollar bill which i clung to
and refused to spend for even the necessaries
of life it was the last of my summers
wage and i cherished it

    loan me a small chew old scout said
honk to me one day


the railroad mans magazine

    i havent got a derned bit i confessed
for the first time in all history  i guess
ill have to quit i havent got no money
to buy any with just now honk stifled
a sob or a chuckle or something and turned
away without a word later that day i
found a whole brand-new dime slab in my
coat pocket where he had surreptitiously
placed it it was a thing most affecting

  they took the medicine house away soon
afterward we stood on the platform shiv-
ering in the raw wintry wind and watched
its familiar lines fade away in the distance
that was the mostest unkindest cut of all-
to go shakespeare one better on superlatives

   that night we slept on cots in the freight-
room it was chilly and uncomfortable
we both caught colds and rheumatism also
neuralgia catarrh and influenza we took
quinin and whisky for it-or them i took
the quinin and honk the whisky

   i guess ill have to jimmy on my way
i said that morning the transconti-
nental people dont know- how to treat guests
ill hit for kansas city first i reckon

  honk begged me to stay on yet a little
while longer he hated to see me go he
said hed stand good for my board and
lodging till spring at the palazzo or any-
where else id select but i told him i was
no moocher and refused to be shaken

  i might have secured a job clerking in
one of valhallas enormous retail empori-
ums maybe but a railroad man dont think
of things like that till its too late

  it was a pathetic parting i stood with
all my earthly belongings in a suit-case
and wrung honks hand while the wind
whipped my legs with the tail of my last
winters overcoat

   write me a card every day till you get
settled he insisted  and if you need
five or ten or twenty-five wire me ill
borrow it somewhere for you and good
luck old boy good luck

  the same to you i snuffled-i had a
bad cold you know  remember the
maine and dont forget to take your medi-
cine regular turpentine and lard on a
flannel rag is good for sore throat i shout-
ed from the steps of the motor-car

  he went irside the station and slammed
the door behind him

  at millardsville i had the good fortune
to strike uncle george jackson on number
 uncle george would carry me to the
outer edge of eternity if every trainmaster in
the universe were aboard the same train

     if i was you said uncle george after
 working his train and hearing my hard
 luck story if i was you son id hike for
 fort worth they tell me its a coming
 metropolis booming all kinds of work
 there and pay you your own price

    id rather risk k c or omaha i
 said but uncle george persisted in lauding
 the texas village all the way the last
 thing lie said after hed fixed it up for me
 with the con on the east end was good-
 by son dont forget fort worth

    naturally then after a fruitless sojourn
 of a week in the river towns during which
 i had spent my ten and pawned my suit-
 case and hadnt been able to connect with
 anything that had the remotest resemblance
 to a meal ticket i turned my face toward
  uncle georges mecca

    i dead-headed a hundred miles or so down
 the frisco struck a hostile crew and went
 on my uppers me that a few short months
 agone had snorted in the exuberance of my
 pride a common weary waggles hitting
 the rods and feeling within me the gnawing
 insistence of an impatient hunger

    what is it my faithful stomach kept
 asking is your throat cut

    but for a few friendly station-agents i
 would have gone into an early decline so
 relentlessly does fortune rub it in when
 once she gets a good man going and it
 was a long walk to fort worth i began to
 believe

    however i never reached the place after
 all one day at the zenith of my degrada-
 tion and misery i drilled into a homespun
 catawampus sort of a hamlet far down in
 the indian-infested hills of oklahoma

   the place was called something that
 sounded like wakickewa ive never been
 able to spell it without the official guide
 and it isnt worth troubling about anyhow
 let it go wakickewa they said it was
 cherokee or blackfoot for he dies hard
 but weve got him

    it was a town of some twenty souls a
 mule team a sad-eyed cowr or two and a
 drug-store where for a dollar-fiftv you
 could buy a bottle of  bitters  that would
 make you trumpet like an elephant im
 not addicted to die bitters habit but the
 incumbent of the railway station one arthur
 arturo or artie birdsall was

    he was a lonely genius and almost crazed
 with the solitude of his vigil so he wel-
 comed me right warmly and i remained to
 divert him a while
honk and horace



  to be exact and adhere to the bare facts
without rhetorical adornment or fanciful
figures of speech the guy was seeing blue-
eyed woggle - worms with yellow pompons
on their ears when i arrived and they were
calling him from the despatchers office
with a clamorous insistence that sounded
urgent to me

  i took the key with one hand and shooed
arturo away with the other he was argu-
ing with me at the time with the leg of his
office-chair it seemed that they particu-
larly desired a wayward freight-train held
at wakickewa for fear it couldnt pass the
up passenger some miles beyond on the
single track which was all they happened
to have along there and the freight in
question was then whistling for our out-
skirts

  i manipulated the board et cetera and
everything went off without mishap

  young birdsall recovered in a few days
and was profusely apologetic to the com-
pany but they couldnt see him for the
smoke and the expected happened

  to pad out a short story and make a
serial of it i got the wakickewa station
it paid forty-five per-a princely stipend to
me at that time in fact it was all clear
money except twelve dollars for board as

aside from bitters there was nothing in the
village for which to spend money

  as soon as i was comfortably ensconced
-there really wasnt enough work on the
job to keep an insomniac awake-i sent a
hallo message to honk in valhalla far
away

  i expected a reply within the hour but
none came the day passed without word
from him

  i wondered if he hadnt gone from val-
halla maybe to become like me a wanderer
up and down the face of the earth to die at
last ignobly and rest in the murky waters
of some darkling stream or in an unmarked
grave in the northwest corner of some back-
number cemetery

  i conjured up all sorts of morbid con-
jectures about him having nothing else to
do while a couple of days worried by with-
out news of him sick dying or dead

  that wakickewa place was a lively burg
phew very few trains bothered to stop
at all all the freight consigned there since
the town began could have been loaded in
one twenty-four foot car and nothing at all
had ever been shipped out

  the southbound local slowed down and
came to a standstill one evening after id
been there ten days and they began to dump

the guv was seeing
blue-eyed wogglb-
worms with yellow
pompons on their
ears when i arrived

 rr


the railroad mans magazine

a line of trunks and packing-cases out of
the baggage-car i wondered what travel-
ing salesman was so far gone as to alight
there by mistake or if it was a show troupe
stranded and looking for a place from which
to start on a thousand-mile walk back to
new york

  at that moment a familiar form swung
from the smoker it had a suit-case in each
hand and a smile from ear to ear

  it was honk buoyant breezy and blithe-
some as ever we fell into each others

arms

   howdy  he said

howdy i came

as soon as i heard from you hows your
chewing holding out this is a punko
place aint it but we dont need to worry
about that for i dont think well sojourn
here any great while

   ive got a great business on foot you
see i brought my trunks along to save
time this place looks malarial to me
youre not so fat as you was are you
hows valhalla i asked

  gone to the dogs he said ive quit
em the place will be gone back to bar-
barism inside of a year-overrun with weeds
and wolves we got away just in time

traveling air-brake school

the lehigh valley railroad has recently sent
out an air-brake instruction car in which an
expert is employed to coach its employees on the
subject of air-brakes and answer anyquestions
which they may put to him it is intended that
this migratory school shall keep the men always
well informed on this phase of railroading opera-
tion as the car will make periodical trips so that
they will have no excuse for getting rusty the
instruction-car is fitted out with all the latest air-

brake equipment both for cars and locomotives
so that the instructor may give practical demon-
strations along with his talks a general bulletin
conveys to the employees information as to the
time of the cars arrival at points along the line
if this does not result in an attendance sufficiently
large special notifications are sent out the in-
struction is for the men in both the transporta-
tion and shop departments since at one time or
another they must deal with air-brakes

it had a suit-case in each hand
and a smile from ear to ear
the railroads clearing-house
for immigrants

by peter mulligan

did you ever try to give traveling directions to a man who could not under-
stand english and whose language you could not speak if so you
can readily imagine what it means to sell tickets and personally direct to
their destinations the hundreds of foreign immigrants who arrive in new york
harbor almost daily

    this is the work the immigrant clearing-house has undertaken and which
it handles so well that few if any of the bewildered newcomers from abroad
ever manage to get lost strayed or stolen

    mr mulligan shows us how this organization which operates with the
smoothness of a well-oiled machine not only protects and guides the immi-
grants to their homes but also carefully looks out for the interests of the rail-
roads themselves

how steerage passengers of the great european liners are collected
tagged apportioned to the railroads and made ready
for the immigrant trains

ight hundred and fifty out of
every thousand immigrants that
formerly entered new york
harbor stopped in the big
city at the gateway of the
new world and filtered
gradually over america within the past
few years however by the establishment
of what is known as the immigrant clear-
ing-house the situation is reversed

  eight hundred out of every thousand
now never set foot in new york at all
they are distributed by the railroads di-
rectly from the ocean steamers to every part
of the country

  each of the great deep-sea liners after
its passengers have passed the health offi-
cers at quarantine docks and discharges
its immigrants into the ellis island boat
that comes alongside past the sky-scra-
pers of lower manhattan at which they
gaze with wide-eyed wonder and longing



the newcomers are carried to the pinnacled
group of red brick buildings that from the
bay seem to fringe the jersey shore

  in single file with hands and heads
cumbered with bags and bundles with

  where are you going is the question
put to each of them who has successfully
passed the swift and searching eyes of the
inspectors and clerks

  thereafter until the immigrant has
reached his final destination-whether it
is scranton or san francisco-that is the
question he has to answer over and over


the railroad mans magazine

again it begins when the clerks commence
to sort out the groups of thirty into which
by law the immigrants are divided on the
ships manifest

  those whose destination is new york
and have fulfilled all the requirements
are allowed to pass without delay to the
ferry-boat the remaining sixty or eighty
per cent bound for other parts of the coun-
try then become the railroads own to
move quickly kindly comfortably with
little or no friction to their journeys ends

  the machinery for this work has been
simplified until it is now able to handle
and carry away thousands of persons a day
without confusion or delay and at the
minimum cost to each railroad

  only yesterday a confused mass of alien
peoples went thronging into manhattan
unacquainted with customs and language
the prey of all varieties of sharpers to-
day a system sends each just where he
wants to go expeditiously pleasantly with
his meager funds unimpaired a separation
of individuals that under the old regula-
tion took many weeks and was accom-
panied by endless complications

  through long corridors and down flights
of stairs with an inspector at every turn
to guide them the immigrants pass the
railroad department fills a large portion of
the lower floor of the huge station it is
divided into two sections one for the bag-
gage and the other for the immigrants
themselves

handling a many-tongued host

  only fifteen per cent of these people
railroad bound and ten per cent of the
entire number of immigrants are to make
their way to new england points the
rest of them are to be transported to the
west and south near and far

  the transporting of these is the business
of the immigrant clearing-house no more
ingenious combination of interests has ever
been planned with the precision of an
army the many-tongued hosts are moved
forward their tickets examined or tickets
provided for those who have steamship
orders sorted into great cages of wire net-
ting like immense aviaries and then with
guides for each party taken off on barges
for the great railway terminals

  a clerical-force of not more than a doz-
en men transact all this railroad work for
the nine lines that comprise the immigrant

clearing-house ten to fifteen inspectors
and twenty to fifty baggage handlers ac-
cording to the low or high tides of immi-
gration make up the rest of the cohort

  the railways that compose the immi-
grant clearing-house are with one exception
trunk lines leading westward whether a
man or a family is to be sent to trenton
new jersey or to spokane washington it
is all the same as a matter of detail

  the nine lines are the new york cen-
tral and hudson river railroad the west
shore the new york ontario and west-
ern the erie the delaware lackawanna
and western the central railroad of new
jersey the lehigh valley the pennsyl-
vania and the baltimore and ohio all
of which are members of the trunk line
association

eager to visit new york

  it is at the door of the big railway
room that the question  where are you
going   asked of every immigrant gains
its greatest insistence it is a broad door-
way but no one passes through without
being questioned over its threshold files
an endless procession from all the nations
of the earth

  one interesting circumstance is that no
small proportion of these people answer
this question with the only english words
they know new york then follows
this dialogue sometimes in arabic or fin-
nish oftener in italian yiddish german
magyar or the lingua franca of the
mediterranean littoral

   show me your railroad ticket or steam-
ship order

   this says you are going to hurley
wisconsin across the room there give
it to the clerk there and he will give you a
ticket

  but i want to go to new york

   are you a citizen of the united states 
  no i want to go to new york

   you are ticketed for hurley wiscon-
sin you cant go to new york unless
you get an order from the chief clerk

   but i want to stop in new york and
see some friends

  jimmie to another railroad inspector
take this man up-stairs to the chief
clerk

  in a few minutes the immigrant is back
again he has been unable to satisfy the
chief clerk that an exception should be
the railroads clearing-house for immigrants 

made in his case and that he should be
allowed to brave the dangers of new york
without some one being responsible for his
ultimate safe delivery to the railroad com-
pany

   so far as possible it is the object of the
railway agent of the clearing-house to send
out all the passengers from each individual
ship over a single line irrespective of the
route their tickets call for suppose immi-
grants from the lucania the adriatic and
the kaiser wilhelm all reached ellis island
the same day

  the lucania immigrants might go out
over the west shore the adriatics over the
pennsylvania and the kaiser wilhelms
over the erie the object is to apportion
the immigrant traffic as equably as pos-
sible on other days the other roads would
get their share one after the other so that
by the end of the week or month each road
would have received the proportion of the
business to which it is entitled	

a saving for the railroads

   it takes no little judgment for the clear-
ing-house agent to distribute these people
so that each road will be thoroughly satis-
fied but the system has been so carefully
worked out tliat there is no difficulty by
cooperation the railroads have brought the
cost of this service to a minimum and in-
stead of each having to maintain a com-
plete equipment at ellis island the in-
dividual expense for each road is only about
 a day when the tide of immigra-
tion is not at its flood

  the preferences of each immigrant is
carefully considered if a man or family
have tickets to go west by the pennsylvania
and the train-load from his ship is sched-
uled to tral by the west shore he will
invariably be asked if he especially wishes
to go by the pennsylvania and if he de-
clares that he does that will end the mat-
ter and he will be sent by that route with-
out the slightest effort being made to change
his desire

  there is no hand about this rail-
road routing the other day a swarthy
magyar approached an inspector appeal-
ingly

  he had been in the united states before
and spoke english he explained that a

ship friend of his who was ticketed by the
lehigh valley wanted to go with him by the
d l and w instead could it be ar-
ranged 

    certainly replied the inspector  you
can both go by the same line and by any
route you wish 

 making up an immigrant train

  the object of all this system of ship-
ping simultaneously as many people as
possible by any one line is to enable that
road to make up its special immigrant
trains

  an immigrant train is not generally sent
out with less than a hundred tickets the
few immigrants whose travel preferences do
not coincide with the days schedule are
carried on the regular trains of the roads
they select

  an immigrant train generally starts from 
its new jersey terminal atfrom six to
eight oclock in the evening it takes
practically all day to sort out the steamer
loads of passengers and to transfer their
heaps of baggage the latter is quite a
complicated task and there must be ac-
curacy and despatch to get the barges that
ply betweeen ellis island and the jersey
shore loaded up at the proper time

  from the railroad room where tickets
are sold and orders exchanged the immi-
grant passes into the baggage-room to
identify his property and thence into the
great room of wire cages one for each
railroad terminal these cages radiate
out from a common center like the spokes
of a wheel

  before the immigrant reaches his desig-
nated waiting place the last before he
leaves ellis island he is asked again and
again the olcl question where are you
going and with the following also new
to his ear

  are you hungry  when did you eat last 

do you want to telegraph to any one 

  there is no insistence as to any of these
inquiries the average immigrant at just
this point is so bewildered that he has
generally forgotten all about eating and
may be faint from hunger but not know
it unless he is reminded also the matter
of telegraphing may have quite slipped his
mind

  saving the life of boone

oonesborough was one of
tgamr those forts or stations erected
by the early settlers of ken-
iwpbw tucky to protect themselves and
families from the incursions of
their savage foes and was the
scene of many a thrilling and soul-stirring
incident

  it was erected in april  by daniel
boone and was located on the southern
bank of the kentucky river it was the
first fort built in that region and its erec-
tion excited the fears of the indians who
were highly incensed at the rapid advance-
ment of the whites into their beautiful hunt-
ing grounds which feeling was still further
increased by the british who had forts
north of the ohio and offered them bribes
for every scalp or prisoner they took

  such being the incentives boonesborough
was besieged onseveral occasions by the in-
dians in large parties sometimes assisted
by their white allies

  itwas the first birthday of american in-
dependence july   the sun which
was just peering above the eastern horizon
gave token of a brilliant day the birds
had laved themselves in the clear cold rills
and were commencing their matinal songs

  the gate of the fort opened and two young
men came out they made their way to the
adjoining fields to commence their daily
toil they entertained no fear of imme-
diate danger from the proximity of indians
as it had been the practise to send scouts up
and down the river every week to look for
indian signs

began in the february railroad mans

io

  but a few days before the scouts had been
out they scoured the country on both
sides and no trail or other evidence of the
indians had been seen hence these two
young men took no precaution against an
attack - not even taking their guns with
them

  at that very moment a body of the-red-
skins was creeping silently and stealthily
through the underbrush of the adjacent
forest toward the fort

  totally unconscious of their peril the
youths went on until they were within about
sixty yards of the indians covert when as
they were about commencing their labor
they were fired upon by at least a dozen
rifles

  the whole scene passed under the eyes
of a young man who for a few preceding
moments had been leaning upon his rifle
gazing listlessly after the two youths from
the gate of the fort where he was awaiting
the laggard steps of two companions who
were to go out with him that morning on a
hunting excursion

  in an instant how changed was his ap-
pearance with body erect his nostrils di-
lated like a war-horse in action his hands
firmly grasping his faithful rifle and with
his eves fixed on the spot where the smoke
was lazily rising in the morning air he
stood the personification of intense excite-
ment

  the young men in the fields who had
been uninjured by the first fire of the in-
dians were now running forlife toward the
fort behind them followed a dozen
swarthy warriors thirsting for their blood
and scalps

  they had nearly reached their goal when
a shot from the leading indian who had

magazine single copies  cents
vanishing railroaders



paused to fire brought down one of them
within seventy yards of the gate

  dropping his rifle the savage sprang for-
ward with a shout of triumph and pro-
ceeded leisurely to scalp the body he had
presumed too much however on the distance
between himself and the fort and paid the
penalty of his presumption

  springing his rifle to his shoulder with a
jerk simon kenton-for he it was who had
been watching the scene from the gateway
-drew a bead upon the redskin and he
tumbled over dead calling to his compan-
ions of the fort who were gathering in num-
bers he bounded forward in pursuit re-
gardless of the superior numbers of the
enemy

  the indians retreating gradually drew
kenton and his companions into dangerous
proximity to a large body of their fellows
who were concealed in the thickness of the
adjacent woods

  it must not be supposed that all this had
taken place without alarming the inmates
of the fort when however boone and
others called out by thespund of the fire-
arms rushed to the gate nothing was to be
seen or heard but the firing in the near-by
woods and the bodies of the young man
and indian in the foreground

  ordering those around him to fellow
boone started for the scene of conflict to
which he was directed by the increasing re-
ports of rifles

  he found the indians as well as kenton
and his companions treed the latter
might easily have been overwhelmed by
numbers but this was not the object of the
savages	v

  kenton observing a warrior aiming his
rifle at boones party from behind a tree
aimed fired first and killed the indian
where he stood

  boone turning to cheer on his men dis-
covered that a body of the enemy had made
a reconnaissance between him and the fort
and cut off his retreat

  quick as thought he gave his orders
to the right about fire charge

  at them they went one to ten it was
fearful odds and the whites suffered ac-
cordingly out of fourteen seven were
wounded among whom was boone himself
whose leg was broken by a ball from the
rifle of a stalwart warrior who rushed for-
ward to tomahawk him and secure the
scalp a trophy which would have made him
a chief

  he was not destined however to attain
the much-coveted honor kenton who had
just rammed down his last ball and who
was on the retreat saw the danger of his
chief met and averted it

  there was not a second to lose the sav-
age was already over him and the next in-
stant would decide the fate of kentuckys
noblest captain

  with the fury of an enraged tiger and
with the seeming impetus of one of his own
bullets he sprang forward not waiting
to bring his piece to the shoulder he thrust
it full at the breast of the indian and dis-
charged it

  the force of the blow and the discharge
caused the savage to measure his length in
his tracks

  dropping his rifle kenton took his friend
and commander in his arms-and he was
no light load-and carried him in safety to
the fort

  after the gates had been made fast and
everything was secure boone sent for ken-
ton and taking him by the hand said
 well done simon you have behaved
vourself like a man indeed you are a fine
fellow

  this coming from boone who was nat-
urally taciturn and not much given to com-
pliment was no faint praise kenton had
well earned it however for he had killed
three indians with his own hands and saved
the life of his leader

chapter vi

the capture of kenton

come months later kenton who had re-
 mained at boones and logans sta-
tions until idleness became irksome deter-
mined to have another bout with the in-
dians for this purpose he combined with
alex montgomery and george clark to go
on a horse-stealing expedition

  they reached old chillicothe without
meeting with an- adventure there they
saw a drove of horses feeding in the rich
prairie of which they secured seven and
started on their return

  on reaching the ohio river they found
it lashed into a perfect fury by a hurricane
and the horses refused to cross

  here was an unlooked-for dilemma it
was evening they felt sure of being pur-
sued and no time was to be lost they
rode back to the hills hobbled their ani-


the railroad mans magazine

mals and then retraced their steps to see
if they were followed

  the next day the wind having sub-
sided the caught their horses and again
endeavored to cross the river but with the
same result the frightened horses would
not take to the water and they were driven
to the alternative of parting with them

  selecting three of the best they turned
the rest loose and started for the falls of
the ohio but avarice whispering that they
might lead the others they returned and
endeavored to retake them

  this was by no means an easy task
while busily -occupied in their endeavor
they were surprised by a party of mounted
indians who had followed their trail the
whites were separated kenton hearing a
whoop in the direction of his comrades dis-
mounted and crept cautiously in the direc-
tion of the sound to discover if possible
the force of the savages

  dragging himself forward on his hands
and knees he came suddenly upon several
indians who did not discover him at the
moment

  being surrounded and considering the
boldest course the best he took aim at the
foremost indian but his gun missed fire

  he was immediately pursued taking
advantage of some fallen timber he en-
deavored to elude his pursuers by dodging
them and hiding among the underbrush
where their horses could not follow but
they were too cunning for him and divi-
ding their forces rode along on either side
of the timber

   they began to  beat it up  and as ken-
ton was emerging at the farther end he was
confronted by one of the savages who threw
himself from his horse and rushed at ken-
ton with a tomahawk

  kenton drew back his arm to defend him-
self with the butt of his gun as he was
about to strike another stalwart savage
seized him in his powerful grasp and pre-
vented the descending blow

  kenton was a prisoner he yielded with
what grace he could command to superior
numbers while they were binding him
alex montgomery made his appearance
and fired at one of the indians but
missed his mark he was immediately pur-
sued in a few moments one of the in-
dians returned shaking the bloody scalp of
his friend in kentons face clark succeed-
ed in making his escape crossing the
river he arrived in safety at logans station

  that night the indians encamped on the
banks of the river in the morning they
prepared to return with their unfortunate
prisoner some little time elapsed ere they
succeeded in catching all their horses

  at length when they did succeed they
determined to torment their captive in re-
turn for the trouble he had caused them

  they selected the wildest and most rest-
ive horse of the number and bound kenton
to his back a rope was first passed round
the under jaw of the horse either end of
which was held by an indian and even
with this advantage it required the assist-
ance of others to control the vicious beast

  kenton was first seated on the animals
back with his face toward the tail and his
feet tied together under the horse another
rope confined his arms and went round the
horse drawing the prisoner down upon his
back a third was secured around his neck
and was fastened to the horses neck and
thence extended longitudinally across his
body to the tail of the horse where it was
secured

  in this way he was securely fastened to
the frantic animal beyond the possibility of
escape to be certain that he was secure
the- fastened another rope to his waist and
fastened it to the one which served as a
girth finally they fastened a pair of moc-
casins on his hands to prevent him from de-
fending his face

  during the time they were preparing him
for his ride they taunted  him by asking
him if he wanted to steal more horses they
danced around him yelled and screamed
and in every possible manner exhibited their
delight at the anticipated suffering of their
victim with yells and thunder shouts
they turned the savage horse loose he
bounded away in fright he darted
through the woods rearing and plunging
and inflicting on his tortured rider count-
less wounds and blows as he dashed against
trees and rushed through the tangled brush

  kenton and the animal were lacerated
with thorns and briers finally with wast-
ed strength and trembling limbs the horse
returned to the spot from which he had
started

  kenton was suffering beyond description
he longed for death to release him from his
torture but the indians were not yet sat-
isfied they mounted other horses and
drove the animal on which kenton was
bound over a wide range of territory

  when the time came that the infuriated
vanishing railroaders



animal could move no more and simply
dropped in its tracks the trusty tomahawk
ended the white mans misery

chapter vii

theescape of christopher miller

vjlt hen general wayne took command
of die expedition destined to act
against the indians of the northwest he
was fully aware of the difficulties which
lay in his way and the almost insurmount-
able obstacles to be overcome

  the enemy against whom he had to con-
tend pursued a vastly different mode of war-
fare from that with whom he had recently
fought and vigilance subtlety and cun-
ning were of far greater need in the com-
mander of such an expedition than the or-
thodox skill of a military chief

  it was highly necessary to be constantly
upon the alert to prevent surprise to guard
against the machinations of his crafty foe
he organized several corps of spies com-
posed of some of the most efficient and ex-
perienced woodsmen and indian hunters
which the frontiers afforded

  the command of these companies was
given to officers distinguished for their in-
trepidity and coolness in danger among
others who merited and obtained this honor
was captain william wells who had been
taken prisoner by the indians while a child
and brought up under their tutelage

  he had been engaged in the action with
st clair and commanded a select body of
the enemy stationed opposite the artillery
and did fearful execution among the men

  feeling assured after that event that the
whites would be revenged and anticipating
their ultimate success in the contest cap-
tain wells left the indians and joined
waynes army

  his knowledge of the country of the in-
dian language and above all of their hab-
its and mode of fighting made him a val-
uable scout

  among his men was one by the name of
henry miller who likewise had served an
apprenticeship with the indians but had
escaped leaving his younger brother chris-
topher-who refused to fly-in their hands
captain wellss men performed many deeds
of valor and bravery during the campaign
which raised them high in the estimation of
the commander and excited against him the
implacable animosity of the indians

  on one occasion he was directed by wayne
to bring in an indian prisoner selecting a
few of his band he started on his perilous
duty

  cautiously and secretly they entered the
indian country hoping to surprise a strag-
gling party but met none searching care-
fully in the neighborhood they came upon
a party of three indians gathered about a
small fire cooking venison

   they had judiciously selected their camp
having located it on the apex of a small
mound cleared of underbrush it gave them
a free and uninterrupted view of the woods
around them thus rendering it difficult to
approach without being discovered

  wells tried to make a clump of trees
near the base of the hill it was a daring
move to make for it-but wells determined
to make the attempt

  calling two officers-miller and mc-
clellan-the three dismounted tying their
horses they commenced to creep on all fours
in a zigzag direction takiog advantage of
every inequality of ground every shrub and
rock to shelter and conceal their approach

  in this manner after much exertion they
reached a fallen tree and for the time were
covered by its branches

  here they arranged their plans one of
the indians was on his hands and knees
blowing the fire another was seated oppo-
site to him engaged in conversation with
the third who was standing in front of the
fire all appeared to be in the best spirits
in anticipation of their meal

  it was arranged that wells and miller
were to shoot the two on either side of
the fire while mcclellan who was as fleet
of foot as a deer was to charge through the
smoke and capture the one in the center
ere he had time to recover from his first
surprise

  resting their rifles on the trunk of the
tree they aimed at the hearts of their foes
in a moment two reports awoke the echoes
of the surrounding forest and mcclellan
was bounding at his utmost speed toward
the camp

  two of the red-skins fell dead while the
third discovering the rapid approach of
the intrepid soldier dropped his rifle and
fled toward the river at the joint where
he approached it the banks were twenty
feet in height

   mcclellan was at his heels however fol-
lowed by the others of the party there
was no opportunity to double and the in-


the railroad mans magazine

diari was forced to leap off into the water
below he stuck fast in the mud floun-
dering and trying to get out

  mcclellan discovering his situation
sprang upon him threatening him with in-
stant death unless he surrendered

  the rest of the party appearing on the
bank above the indian found his escape
hopeless and yielded himself a prisoner
after considerable exertion wells and mil-
ler managed to drag mcclellan and the in-
dian out of the mire

  the indian proved sulky and refused to
speak in washing the mud off him they
discovered that he was a white man

  the captive refused to utter a word
miller thinking it might be his brother
whom he had left among the indians rode
up alongside him and called him by his
indian name

  the effect was instantaneous the man
started turned toward his brother and in
the indian tongue eagerly demanded how
he came to know his name

  miller easily explained the mystery and
the brothers were locked in each others
arms the next moment	

  the prisoner was christopher miller
who by one of those providential occur-
rences by which the white man seems to
be protected from danger while the red
man is fated to extinction had escaped in-
stant death at the hands of his own broth-
er had his situation in camp been dif-
ferent had he been on either side of the
fire instead of in the center of the group
his death would have been inevitable

  after scalping the two dead indians the
party returned to headquarters with their
prisoner he was ordered to the guard-
house by wayng who interrogated him in
regard to the intentions of the indians he
remained for some time sulky and reserved
notwithstanding the efforts of captain
wells and his brother to induce him to
abandon the indians and return to civilized
life on being released unconditionally
however he agreed joining wellss com-
pany he served faithfully during the rest
of the campaign

chapter viii
a fist fight in old kentuck

toe logston was one of that class
of  half-horse half-alligator kentuck-
ians who could to use his own words

out-run out-hop out-jump throw down
drag out and whip any man in the country

  joe was a powerful fellow-six feet three
in his stockings and proportionately stout
and muscular with a handsome good-na-
tured face and a fist like a janney coupler

  fear he knew not fighting was his pas-
time particularly if his scalp was the prize
for which he fought

  on one occasion he was mounted on his
own favorite pony which was leisurely pick-
ing its way along the trail with its head
down joe was enjoying a feast of wild
grapes which he picked as he came along

  neither dreamed of danger until the
crack of two rifles on either side of the
path killed one and wounded the other

  one ball struck joe grazing the skin
above his breast bone the other pierced
his horses flank in an instant joe was
on his feet grasping his rifle-he had in-
stinctively seized it as he slipped to the
ground-and looking for his foe

  he might easily have escaped by run-
ning as the guns of the indians were empty
and they could not pretend to compete with
him in speed but joe was not one of that
sort he boasted that he had never left
a battlefield without making his mark and
he was not going to begin now

  one of the savages sprang into the path
and made at him but finding his opponent
prepared for him he sought refuge in a
tree

  joe knowing there were two of the
indians looked earnestly about him for
the other and soon discovered him between
a couple of saplings engaged in reloading
his gun

  the trees were scarcely large enough to
shield him his back was partly exposed
joe quick as thought drew a bead fired
and struck him

  now that his rifle was empty the big in-
dian who had first made his appearance
rushed forward feeling sure of his prev
and rejoicing in the anticipated possession
of joes scalp

  joe was not going to lose the natural
covering of his head without a struggle he
calmly awaited the savage with his rifle
clubbed and his feet braced for a powerful
blow perceiving this his foe halted ten
paces and with all the vengeful force qf a
vigorous arm threw his tomahawk full at
joes face

with the rapidity of lightning it whirled
through the air but joe equally as quick
vanishing railroaders



in his movements dodged it suffering only
a slight cut on his left shoulder as it passed

  then he rushed in the indian darted
into the bushes and successfully dodged
the blows made at his head by the now en-
raged hunter who getting madder and mad-
der at the failure of his successive efforts
gathered all his strength for a final blow

  this the cunning savage dodged as be-
fore and the rifle which by this time had
become reduced to the simple barrel struck
a tree and flew out of joes hand into the
bushes ten feet away

  the indian sprang to his feet and con-
fronted joe empty handed they stood for a
moment measuring each thq others strength

  it was but for a moment for the blood
was flowing freely from the wound in joes
breast the other thinking him more seri-
ously wounded than he really was and
wishing to take advantage of his weakness
closed with him intending to throw him

  he reckoned however without his host
for in less time than it takes to tell it he
found himself at full length on his back
with joe on top

  slipping from under with the agility of
an eel the indian was soon free they
were both on their feet again-and again
closed this time the savage was more
wary but the same result followed and
he was again beneath his opponent

  having the advantage of joe in being
naked to the waist and oiled from head to
foot he could slip from the grasp of the
hunter and resume his feet with wonder-
ful alacrity six different times was he
thrown and as many times did he regain
his feet

  finally their struggles and contortions
brought them to the open path and joe
concluded to change his tactics he was
becoming weaker from loss of blood while
on the other hand the savage seemed to lose
none of his strength from bis many falls

  closing again in a close hug they fell
as before but this time instead of endeavor-
ing to keep his antagonist down joe sprang
quickly to his feet and as the indian
came up he dealt him a blow with his
clenched fist between the eyes which felled
him then joe threw himself with all his
might on the indians body

  this was repeated every time the in-
dian rose it soon began to tell with fear-
ful effect upon his body as well as his face
for joe was no lightweight at every suc-
ceding fall the indian came up weaker and

seemed disposed to retreat this joe de-
cidedly objected to and dealt his blows
more rapidly until the savage lay appar-
ently insensible at his feet

  falling upon him joe grasped the in-
dians throat with a grip like a vise intend-
ing to strangle him he soon found how-
ever that the savage was playing possum
the indian was up to something the pur-
port of which joe could not immediately
guess

  watching with the keen eye of a lynx
joe discovered that the indian was trying
to disengage his knife which was in his
belt the handle however was so short
that it slipped down beyond reach and he
was working it up by pressing on the point
joe watched the movement with deep in-
terest and when the indian had worked it
up sufficiently for his purpose joe quickly
seized it

  with one powerful blow he drove it to
the hilt in the indians heart

  springing to his feet joe now turned to
the other red-skin he lay still his back
broken by joes ball his gun was loaded
and he was trying to raise himself upright
to fire it but every time he brought it to
his shoulder he would tumble forward and
again renew his struggle concluding that
he had had enough fighting and knowing
that the wounded indian could not escape
joe returned to the fort

  although he presented an awful sight
when he reached there-his clothes being
torn nearly from his body which was cov-
ered with blood and dirt from his head to
his feet-yet his story was scarcely believed
by many of his comrades they thought
it one of joes big stories

   go and satisfy yourselves he said

  a party started for the battle-ground
where their suppositions were confirmed
no indians were to be found and no evi-
dence of them except joes dead horse in
the road on looking carefully about how-
ever they discovered a trail which led
them a little distance into the bushes there
they discovered the body of the big indian
buried under the leaves by the side of a
stump following on they found the corpse
of the second with his own knife thrust in-
to his heart and his hand still grasping it
to show that he came to his death by his
own hand

  the knife with which joe had killed the
big indian they found after a long search
thrust into the ground where it had been

forced by the heel of his wounded com-

traces of the white mans victory

chapter ix

defending the wagon

t etween the blue ridge and the
western range of the alleghany
mountains in the northern part of the state
of virginia is located shenandoah coun-
ty it derives its name from the beautiful
river one branch of which flows through
its entire length from south to north

  woodstock a thriving town was settled
previous to the french and indian war by
hardy german yeomanry from pennsyl-
vania who were tempted to leave the rug-
ged hills of the keystone state by the glow-
ing reports which had reached their ears
of the surprising fertility and surpassing
beauty of the valley of the shenandoah

  gathering their household goods they
reluctantly turned their backs on the homes
of their first choice and took their way
through pathless forests to the promised
land

  arriving at their new home they selected
woodstock as the nucleus of the settlement
and commenced with a will the laborious
task of-felling the forest and the erection
of their homes

  a stockade fort was erected as a pro-
tection against the incursions of predatory
bands of indians a short time sufficed
to place these hardy settlers in circum-
stances which if not actually flourishing
were comparatively thrifty they promised
so well that they were led to look forward
with hope and anticipation to a long-con-
tinued prosperity

  they were a plain frugal industrious
people unacquainted with luxuries and
only desiring the substantial requisites of
the simple life these were furnished in
abundance by the fertile soil of the valley
in which they had taken up their abode

  among others who had been attracted to
the beautiful valley by the glowing ac-
counts of its fertility and comparative se-
curity were two heads of families by the
names of sheets and taylor the former
was of german parentage the latter of
english birth but having both married
american women and being drawn to-
gether by that invisible bond of sympathy

which in a new country where danger is
a common heritage unites with a stronger
tie than that of blood-they were more
like one family than two separate house-
holds

  being driven from their homes by the
massacre of two of their neighbors families
they hastily collected a few necessaries and
with their wives and children started in
search of a new home woodstock was the
nearest town where there was a fort and
toward that place they directed their wagons

  the taylor family consisted of himself
wife and three children that of sheets
numbered but three-himself wife and
one child the few articles which the
limited room in the wagon and the hurried
nature of their departure allowed them to
remove were a chest of drawers a feather
bed a brass kettle or two some few culinary
articles and the axes and rifles of tfye men
these belongings their horses and a stout
wagon were all they had saved yet they
were happy that they were alive and
trudged along satisfied if they could but
reach a haven of safety from the barbarities
which had been inflicted upon their less
fortunate neighbors

  the greater portion of their way lay
through the forest where every sound to
their affrighted ears gave token of an enemy
lurking in their path the rustling of a
leaf or the sighing wind awoke their fears
and called up their latent courage

  at length they had reached die brow of
the hill from which they had a view of the
beautiful valley were they hoped to find a
haven of rest they paused for a moment
to admire the scene which opened before
them-to admire the natural glories of their
new home as they spoke the deadly rifle
of a concealed foe was leveled full at their
breasts a savage red-skin thirsting for
their blood stood within a few feet of
them hidden by the thick underbrush
which grew by die side of the road five
tawny warriors painted and bedecked with
their war feathers lay crouching like wild
beasts ready to spring on their prey

  just as they started to resume their way
and descend the hill toward the settlement
the crack of two rifles and the whizzing of
two leaden messengers sent die two men to
their death the aim had been sure and
both taylor and sheets fell without a
groan pierced through the heart with the
fatal bullet of an unerring aim

  quick as the flash from a summer cloud
vanishing railroaders



were all the fondly cherished hopes of the
wives and children-their safety and fu-
ture happiness blasted and stricken to earth
with the fall of the heads of their families

  no cry was uttered by the bereaved wom-
en their feelings were too deep for utter-
ance and there was no time for grief

  they looked around for the foe and for
means of defense nothing was within
reach but the axes of their husbands these
they seized and awaited the onset of the
savages they had not long to wait push-
ing aside the foliage five stalwart warriors
sprung with a grunt of satisfaction from
the thicket into the road and made for the
wagon to secure their prisoners

  the first to come up seized the son of
mrs taylor and tried to drag him from
the wagon the little fellow resisted man-
fully looking up into his mothers face as
if to implore protection at her hands

  the appeal was not lost seizing the ax
with both hands and swinging it above her
head she brought it down with all the venge-
ful force of her arm on the shoulder of the
indian inflicting a wound which sent him
off howling with pain

  turning to another she served him in a
similar manner while mrs sheets had sent
a third back to his lair with a severe blow
which severed his fingers

  the other two indians were wise enough
to keep outside the range of their blows but
endeavored to intimidate them by their ter-
rific yells and brandished tomahawks

  nothing daunted however the brave
heroic women maintained their theatening
attitude of defense until wearied of their
endeavors and fearing the approach of re-
lief from the garrison of the fort the two
unwounded indians rushed into the thicket
for their rifles

  it was their intention to end the conflict
taking advantage of this opportunity the
women started the horses the red-skins
not daring to pursue them they reached
the fort in safety a corps was sent out to
bring in the dead and scalped bodies of
their husbands

       chapter x
       boyd before butler

a fter the fearful massacre in the val-
ley of wyoming the united states
government awoke to the necessity of stri-
king a blow which should teach the indians

and their allies of those early times the
bloodthirsty tories that it was strong to
punish such inhuman acts an army of
five thousand men was assembled in the
fall of  to penetrate the indians coun-
try in western new york and destroy the
nest of vipers at niagara which was the
headquarters from which the indians drew
their supplies and received their rewards

  the expedition was under command of
general sullivan and embraced among
other corps a part of morgans riflemen

  after a severe battle at conevvawah-
now thecity of elmira-sullivan reached
little beardstown there he encountered
a deep stream which required bridging be-
fore the army could cross

  while waiting there lieutenant boyd of
the rifle corps a young officer of great
promise was sent across the river with
twenty-six men to reconnoiter

  piloted by a faithful indian guide boyd
and his party reached the village which
they found deserted although it was evi-
dent that the indians had recently been
there for their fires were still burning

  night was approaching when boyd had
completed his reconnaissance and he con-
cluded to camp where he was

  in the morning at the first dawn some
few of his men were on their feet ap-
proaching the village they discovered two
indians skulking about one of these was
shot by a man named murphy a brave
fighter who feared no man even though he
endangered his own life

  suspecting that more indians might be in
the neighborhood and having performed
the duty assigned to him boyd commenced
to retrace his steps

  he soon discovered that a large body of
the enemy chiefly indians were lying in
ambush between him and the army see-
ing that his case was a desperate one and
having no other alternative he determined
to cut his way through

  forming his men in a solid phalanx and
cheering them lustily he led them to the
attack the first charge was unsuccessful
singular as it may seem not a man of the
little party was killed although they were
opposed by some five hundred savage war-
riors and tories

  the second and third attacks were more
unfortunate almost all of the party being
killed only two or three succeeded in get-
ting through boyd and a man named par
ker were taken prisoners on the spot


the railroad mans magazine

  as soon as boyd found himself in the
hands of the bloodthirsty and revengeful
tories he demanded an interview with
brandt the indian leader preferring to
throw himself upon brandts well-known
clemency rather than trust to the generosity
or forbearance of his tory colleague

  the chief being near presented himself
boyd giving a secret-society sign and
grasping his hand with the grip of a
brother claimed his protection

  brandt belonging to the same society
recognized both and claimed the two pris-
oners as his own promising and assuring
them that their lives should be spared

  they would have been had not brandt
been called away from the camp on duties
of importance advantage was taken of his
absence by colonel butler to endeavor to
extort from the prisoners under threat of
torture information regarding general sul-
livans army

  in the council-house of the village there
assembled a remarkable group of men be-
fore a table on which were scattered maps
papers and writing materials was seated a
short fleshy ill-favored man whose head
indicated but few moral or intellectual fac-
ulties and whose features were as expressive
as his head

  he was cold and cruel his dress was
the uniform of the royal greens of which
regiment he was the colonel this was
colonel john butler

  opposite to him sat an aide-de-camp pre-
pared to commit to paper the statements of
the prisoner in front of butler kneeling
upon one knee was the light active form
of lieutenant boyd his white hunting-
shirt brought him out in bold relief from
the dusky forms of the savages two of whom
held him in their grasp while behind him
stood the stalwart form of little beard the
most vindictive and cruel of the allies of
great britain

  he was distinguished for a diabolical in-
vention for torturing a prisoner and when-
ever this was on the program he was mas-
ter of ceremonies

  with one hand twined in the long hair of
boyds head he wielded a tomahawk in the
other	n

  the tomahawk was raised to strike the
death-blow on the signal from butler be-
hind him stood the other prisoner parker
in the hands of a fourth savage several
warriors and soldiers completed the grogp

to be co

   colonel butler lost no time in interroga-
 ting the prisoner

   what is your name

    boyd

   your rank

    lieutenant

   what corps

   morgans rifle corps

    what is the number of sullivans
 army  

    i shall not answer the question

    boyd life is sweet and you are yet a
 young man there is no possibility of your
 escape and you have only one alternative
 either answer my question immediately or
 you must die

    colonel butler replied the intrepid
 soldier i am in your hands do with me
 as you see fit i know your power and your
 will to put me in the severest torture but
 you cannot shake my determination to re-
 fuse to answer your questions

    your death he upon your own head
 then take him away

   parker was questioned in like ftianner
 with equal spirit he-refused to answer he
 too was handed over to the tender mercies
 of the barbarous savages who commenced
 at once their brutal and fearful orgies

   tying boyd to a tree after stripping him
 of his clothing they formed a ring about
 him and commenced their infernal dance
 over a prisoner at the stake every means
 which artful cunning could invent or hate
 conceive was brought into play to intim-
 idate the courageous boyd but without
 effect

   they pierced him with their knives
 shook their tomahawks in his face stuck
 sharp sticks into his flesh and then threw
 their hatchets as near to his head and body
 as they could without killing him finding
 that their endeavors to frighten him were
 of -no effect and fearing the return of
 brandt they finally cut a hole in his body
 and drove him around the tree until he
 dropped dead he was then beheaded and
 his liead stuck on a pole beneath a dogs
 head which ghastly trophy was left when
 they retired from the town

   parker who had been compelled to wit-
 ness this scene in anticipation of a similar
 or worse fate was simply beheaded owing
 to their haste

   his body and boyds were found and
 buried the next day by the army in passing
 through the town

saved by snowballs-hogans eminent domain-jim reachs

omebody dropped i set of false
  teeth on the long platform of
  the kansas city union station
  where you walk up and down
  while waiting for your train

    gateman ralph eldridge was
the first to spy the teeth and he
gave them a little kick to the left detective
bradley saw them next and gave them a
little kick to the right matron evering-
ham saw them next she daintily kicked
them forward mr king tourist-pilot for

gave them a swift kick aft

  so there was that vicious set of false
teeth roaming at large in thedepot enclosure
unrestrained and unmuzzled a sinister thing
lurking in the path of the passers-by a
horrible public menace

  now it came to pass that before the sta-
tion-porter overtook that set of -menacing
false teeth with his broom it was encoun-
tered by an elderly man from texas

  gateman ralph eldridge noticed the old
man and suspected that he had escaped
from a sanatorium for his right foot was
encased in a carpet-slipper of many colors
the most conspicuous hues being green blue
yellow violet and crimson

  eldridge also noticed that the old man
hobbled rather than walked about the plat-
form

  then all of a sudden eldridges ears
were assailed by a scream that meant mortal

scriu began in june  railroad ma

agony he turned around to behold the
carpet-slippered man sitting on the platform
with his knee up against his chin trying to
extract the false teeth from one of his slip-
pers

   eldridge rushed up to the sufferer just
in time to hear him make these few philo-
sophic remarks

    what kind of a station management is
this anyway hang the man who left his
false teeth here to bite a mouthful out of
my foot and me with rheumatism and a
thousand miles to travel before i reach my
private physician in texas 

    im sorry sir said eldridge his voice
tremulous with sympathy for the excruci-
ating pain of which he was a witness

  a crowd gathered depot detective
bradley came up and asked the old gentle-
man his name

  im henry wilson of texas i mean
to employ a lawyer and bring suit against
this company for letting a set of false teeth
stick their fangs into this rheumatic foot of
mine its criminal negligence 

   matron everingham ministered deftly to

piloted the poor bitten man to a bench where
lie sat perfectly still till the rock islands

him up and hauled him out of missouri

  two months later

passed through kan-
sas city i too
paced that long plat-
form while waiting
for the golden state limited while i
paced ralph eldridge opened his gate and
announced to all the world that a frisco
train was about to depart for points in ar-
kansas

  i stood by eldridges gate watching him
as he punched holes in tickets nearly the
last man in kansas city who seemed to
want that frisco train was one who handed
eldridge a ticket to springdale

  that man from springdale looked as if
he were made up to play the part of an agri-
culturist in a drama entitled  in truly
rural arkansas instead of passing on
with his punched ticket he stopped and
scrutinized eldridge so minutely that the
gatemans face crimsoned as he said

    dont block the passage please
having finished his survey the farmer
said

  look hffre boy youre altogether too
husky to be loafing around a railroad-sta-
tion you ought to go to work tell you

  what ill do for you
  boy ill give you an
  order- for an ax and
  you get it and come
  down to my farm and
  set to work cutting
  down trees on my
  woodland and i
  promise that ill pay
  you good wages

   as he spoke the
 farmer placed his va-
 lise on the platform
 and seated himself
 then he took out a
 stub of a pencil and
 scribbled on a bit of
 paper

    there boy he
  said handing the pa-
  per to eldridge ill
  expect you then
  he boarded the train

  three oclock on the day after christmas
in shelbyville missouri

 james b smith was dead the whole
town had turned out for the obsequies for
james b smith had been the ablest politi-
cian and thriftiest farmer in all shelby
county all who knew him in life had
gathered to hear of the good that would live
after him

  just as the minister reached the point of
profoundest solemnity the shrill whistle of
a locomotive pierced the air

  such an instantaneous pricking up of ears
on the part of the population had never be-
fore been known in that town never be-
fore had a locomotive-whistle been heard
within the limits of the seat of shelby
county

  the whistling was repeated with an after-
math of wheezing prolonged to the limit of
endurance this second tooting set the
blood of the multitude a tingling inside
the church a general stir ensued outside
ten thousand miles by rail



a man on the edge of the crowd turned his
back on the overflow of mourners and started
off with an earnestness of countenance and
velocity of gait to see the machine capable
of producing that wondrous sound

  that daring deserter from the obsequies
was followed by two more men on the
track of the two came twenty in the wake
of the twenty came forty-five and more
the funeral party gradually dispersed until
all within and without the church had gone
leaving only the minister and the pall-
bearers and the family of the departed

  those who thus left the bier of james
b smith did so in the belief that he would
have approved for mr smith had worked
overtime to procure a whistle - blast for
which shelbyville had been waiting for
three-quarters of a century

  let us follow the multitude behold the
citizens now surging rank on rank upon the
monster that could whistle like a demon

  what a monster it was many a time it
had awakened those who snored on second
avenue new york city as it marched on
stilts past innumerable cham-
bers comprising the cliff-
dwellings that flanked the
right-of-way of the manhat-
tan elevated railroad

  shelbyvilles first locomo-
tive at length had arrived

cal meldrum the first loco-
motive engineer ever to enter
shelbyville strictly on busi-
ness leaned from his cab
window and shouted

   it was a great run down
from shelbina friends

   we covered the ten miles
in twenty-two minutes you
yourselves built this railroad
and should be proud of your
achievement

  it was a great moment for
shelbyville but it was only
a moment there was soon to
come however a whole day of
festivities when the last spike
was to be driven and the first
passenger-train to be run over
the newly constructed line
from shelbyville to shelbina
where the new railroad would
connect with the chicago

burlington and quincy thus
bringing shelbyville into the

  and this is how it all happened

  on a summers clay in  six men
came to shelbyville they were driving a
surrey and they were large of girth and
istature to the county court-house the
six men weije led there to be seated on a
platform in full view of shelbyville in
mass-meeting assembled one of the six
strangers began to talk to the meeting

  those six men be it known were pro-
moters they had come to shelbyville
to put before the citizens a proposition to
build a railroad that would forever lift
shelbyville out of isolation

  the six didnt want a thing from shel-
byville except free ground for station and
yards free right-of-way through the whole
county an advance of five thousand dollars
in coin for surveys free water and light
for five years exemption from town and
county taxation for ten years an advance
of ten thousand dollars cash for prelimi-
nary construction and the construction by

mrs rfach
must tell
you-good
morning

other adjuncts of a railroad in the way of
edifices

  thats about all the promoters wanted

  silence pervaded the hall of judgment
and mercy as the speaker sat down maybe
shelbyville was stunned by his modesty
anyhow even the chairman of the mass-
meeting sat as if overtaken by petrifaction

  finally however a voice from a front
seat was heard every head turned to be-
hold james b smith richest citizen and
ablest politician in shelbyville

  mr chairman and gentlemen mr
smith said  i allow its the general opin-
ion of this meeting that since we are in-
formed that we ourselves must survey the
line lay the grade and tracks put up all
the buildings and bear all the cost of op-
erating the railroad for some five or ten
years-i allow i repeat that since this is
the case as defined by the philanthropists
from chicago we might as well own the
railroad ourselves and operate it ourselves
pursuant to which of course i now pledge
the sum of ten thousand dollars to start a
fund for the construction of the railroad
without any help advice or interference
from any more promoters from chicago

  the mass - meeting recovered from its
trance and greeted mr smiths words with
applause so vociferous that the court-

                    house ceiling almost
cracked-

    i pledge two thou-
sand  shouted a
farmer at the rear of
the hall

   and i five thou-
sand   yelled the
leading hanker of
shelbyville

   and i will give
four thousand  cried
the proprietor of shel-
byvilles department-
store

thus the pledges continued till more than
one hundred thousand dollars had been
promised right in the faces of the six pro-
moters

thats how shelbyville raised the money
to build the shelby county railroad to run
between shelbyville and shelbina a dis-
tance of ten miles

a company was formed contracts for the
work were awarded and the citizens agreed
to give the company a bonus of ten thou-
sand dollars provided the road was com-
pleted by january  

  the first locomotive arrived at shelby-
ville on the day after christmas 
though the road was not yet completed
only four days were left in which to com-
plete the road-and that bonus simply must
be earned

  in every place where men were employed
work ceased the men proceeded to the
right-of-way of the new shelby county
railroad they dug and carted they laid
ties and rails and ballast

  that volunteer industrial army worked
like trojans right up to midnight on the
last day of  then the amiy went to
bed the shelby count railroad was
ready to be opened to the public

  on january   the last spike was
driven and speeches made by the president
and other officers

   after the speeches the first run was made
the train consisting of the locomotive from
the new york elevated system two real
passenger-coaches some flat cars coal cars
and everything else that the teakettle could
haul at one time

   before that historical train started james
b smith set a patriotic example by paying
five dollars for his ticket for the round trip
to shelbina every man who could afford
it followed suit those who couldnt spare
ten thousand miles by rail



five dollars paid one dollar for everybody
wished to help the new railroad

  as cal meldrum pulled the first train
into shelbina he leaned from his cab win-
dow and shouted

   under the management of the houck
boys weve got the littlest but the best rail-
road in missouri

  and james b smith who had started
the whole business and had worked for the
shelby county railroad like a jim hill
was at rest in the cemetery

this coach was a target

  snow had fallen the night before the
country around trenton missouri lay un-
der a blanket of white in the afternoon
the weather turned cruelly cold neverthe-
less colonel william carpenter and his
friend the judge went out for their usual
walk as they crossed the rock island
tracks colonel carpenter said

    this is the weather for railroad wrecks
judge cold costs the railroads lots of
money every winter-from snake-rails

  the judge wanted to know what a snake-
rail might be and the colonel answered

    a rail split by the intense cold there
she blows now he added

  the california special was whistling for
the station at trenton

  the two men trudged on through the snow
beside the track and presently the califor-
nia special thundered by and then-
colonel carpenter and the judge saw the
locomotive shoot up into the air to plunge
into a snow-drift while two of the pull-
mans leaped to a position at right angles
with the track and a passenger-coach top-
pled over

  one agonized shriek-a womans voice
theiall-was still

    derailed the colonel said quite calm-
ly  snake-rail he added then bounded
toward the wreck followed by the judge a
number of trentonites came on a run to-
ward the scene of the disaster

  flames were now rising from the over-
turned passenger-coach out of the windows
of which men and women were climbing in
frantic haste

  that car is full of passengers and
many of them will be burned to death un-
less we can extinguish the fire shouted
some one

  wherell we get the water said an-
other  everythings frozen

   theres millions of gallons of water
right at our feet  cried colonel carpenter
 everybody get to work 

  he hurled a snowball at the burning

coach

  instantly the crowd understood every
man began to snowball the coach

  more and more citizens joined the fire
department till fully a hundred men were
hurling snowballs thus the flames were
soon extinguished all rushed to the coach
to join in rescuing those who had not yet
been able to scramble out not one passen-
ger had been seriously hurt by the flames

   but said an old man-the last to be
helped out -  if it hadnt been for that
snowballing many of us would have been
cremated alive

   the train conductor in his report said

   one coach-load of passengers was saved
by ten thousand snowballs thrown by an
army of one hundred persons commanded by
colonel william carpenter many of his
soldiers are suffering worse than the pas-
sengers or crew in the wreck-from frozen
fingers toes feet and ears

   it was the general opinion of the men and
officials of the rock island that so many
lives had never been saved by so novel a
scheme of rescue following a railroad
wreck

  colonel carpenters valiant army stood
knee-deep in snow with the mercury at
twelve degrees below zero many of his
men had hastened to the rescue without
overcoats or gloves or proper protection for
head and feet and some of them lay  beds
of sickness for days afterward suffering se-
verely as the result of exposure to the cold
and from frozen fingers and frozen toes

  two weeks after the snake-railing of
the california special colonel carpenter

the railroad mans magazine

  a gang of graders were laying the road-
bed of the new springfield and southwest-
ern railroad through green county toward
springfield missouri early in april
 the road-bed had been laid to within
a few hundred yards of a shack that stood
directly on the right-of-way as staked by
the engineers

  the foreman of the graders hastened to
the shack and found it a combination house
and stable the whole serving as the domicile
of one daniel hogan and ms horses

  hogan had worked for many years as a
section-hand for the missouri pacific rail-
road but was now a horse-trader living in
the shack as a squatter he did not own the
land consequently the railroad people hav-
ing obtained general consent to the right-of-
way through the county had not deemed
it necessary to  approach  hogan person-
ally on the subject of tearing down his
shack

  dan hogan said the grade foreman
 you must move out of here my men will
reach this spot in a day or two-and the
line runs right through this shanty

   go long with you replied hogan as
he lighted his pipe  sure havent i lived
here for fourteen years me homes me
own and ill wallop the first man that
touches stick or timber of it maybe ill
put you in law too mind i do be full
acquainted with the law

  two days later when the grade reached
the hut hogan stood in his doorway bel-
ligerent hostile pugnacious rolling up
his sleeves he cried

    one at a time now yous ill fight any
wan of yous that trespasses on me home 
the foreman argued and protested and
even demanded that hogan abandon the hut
peacefully but the irate son of erin talked
so much about going to law that he suc-
ceeded in frightening the foreman into the
belief that possibly any attempt to dislodge
the squatter by force might plunge the rail-
road company into legal complications

  the upshot of the matter was that the
foreman ordered his men to build the road-
bed right up to the south wall of the hut
to leave the hut alone and then to resume
work northward from the north wall

  a month later along came the track-lay-
ers and a new foreman met the enemy in
the person of the obstinate hogan

    were going to pull this building down
hogan announced the foreman

    its mighty confidint yez are answered

the old section-hand lay hand on me
home and ill make it so hot for your com-
pany in the coorts that youll be losing your
job for trespassin illegal sure im an in-
tilligent man and i know me rights

  the foreman of track-layers could not
adopt the course that had been pursued by
the graders namely to build up to the
south wall of the shack and then resume
work northward from the north wall

  therefore the foreman of track-layers
now hurried down the line to where the rail-
road construction engineer a young man
named edgar morrison was inspecting the
work

  morrison after listening to the foremans
story of the predicament with respect to dan
hogans hut said thoughtfully

   you say that hogan keeps repeating the
statement that he is a man of intelligence
yes well then thats his weak spot no
argument will avail with him except one that
touches his vanity in respect to what he con-
ceives to be his intellect i think i see a
way to get rid of hogan without a hand-to-
hand fight and without bringing the affair
into court

  a few hours later young morrison
sauntered up to dan hogans shack en-
tered and said politely

   pardon my intrusion is this mr dan-
iel hogan  

   thats me name answered the horse-
trader  and sure i know you mr morri-
son youre the boss over all the ignorant
foremen on this railroad work

  yes mr hogan ive come to have a
little talk about this home of yours because
i know you to be a man of intelligence-i
may say large intelligence

   aye  assented hogan throwing out his
chest

  well then mr hogan as the ambas-
sador of the railroad company and as czar
to this your castle it is my duty to remind
you of an important matter of which you
doubtless already possess full knowledge
but which you seem to have overlooked in
your very able debates with our foremen
i hardly need say to a man of your intel-
ligence that i refer to the right of eminent
domain

  hey whats that cried hogan
growing red in the face yis yis i
understand now dye know i had clean
forgotten all about her tis true ive
heard say she do be the owner of this land
 its a pleasure to converse with an in-
ten thousand miles by rail



telligent man like you my dear mr ho-
gan said the young engineer  you will
permit me now to mention a fact-of which
you are cognizant of course-relating to
the right of eminent domain as applied to
railroads when acquiring property in this
state for purposes of
right-of-way

    the supreme court
of missouri as you al-
ready well know has re-
cently handed down a
decision that the right
of eminent domain as
applied to a railroad ac-
quiring a right - of - way
does by reasonable con-
struction include the right
to exercise the said power
of eminent domain for the
acquisition of any of the
necessary adjuncts of such
road

    aye  put in hogan

 the lady knew her
rights and of coorse the
suprame coort backed her
up i do not dispute
that mister morrison

    therefore my dear
mr hogan continued
the engineer  that right
as applied specifically to
this castle of yours gives
the railroad the power to
condemn raze destroy
and obliterate this house
and stable forthwith with-
out further notice all of
course in the lawful exer-
cise of the right of emi-
nent domain you quite
thoroughly under-
stand the situation my dear mr hogan
of course you do you understand that any
further obstinacy on your part would be a
distinct reflection on your intelligence

    well now mister morrison the squat-
 ter replied since you put it that way i
 may as well inform you that sich was me
 own opinion tell the lady that til be
 movin this night over to the house of jim
 oriley whose wife do be takin in boord-
 ers of which be to-morrow marnin ill
 be wan

   morrison sauntered away his grave face
 betraying none of his inward amusement
 he had not gone far however when he

wheeled round and returned to the hut to

say

   pardon me mr hogan my own lim-
ited intelligence leaves me in a quandary
i am in some doubt as to the particular lady
to whom you refer-the one to whom you

wish me to convey your courteous message
the lady exclaimed dan hogan
 sure who should i mean but the lady who
do be provin to me her right to exercise
her power over this property and all neces-
sary adjuncts thereof i mean the lady
who owns this land-emmy domain

the conductor fan

   at every rock island railroad station in
missouri conductor jim reach was known
as a baseball enthusiast in st louis
where lie lived he was famous among the
railroad boys as the hottest fan of them all

ill kill any one that trespasses on me home


the railroad mans magazine

  even while he was terminal yardmaster
at st louis he frequently contrived some-
how to get away from his post long enough
to see the last half of the big games

  when he became a conductor and got a
day run he still managed to attend the most
important games but grieved deeply be-
cause he missed seeing the lesser twirlers
and sluggers at work for ten years he
divided his time between conducting rock
island trains and fanning at the baseball
parks

  one evening jim reach returned to his
home on spring avenue and said to his
wife

  mollie im transferred to a night run

   then you yourself asked for the trans-
fer jim dear now didnt you mrs
reach replied

   yes

   please change back to the day run
jim if you take the night run youll
spend all your afternoons watching base-
ball games thats why you changed
isnt it

   yes

  jim dear youre a mason youre an
elk youre a member of the missouri ath-
letic club-and all these societies together
with your baseballing take you away from
home too much think of our children
they want to see their father once in a
while please jim dear dont take the
night run

   ive asked for and received the trans-
fer mollie whats done is done but i
will cut out the lodges and leave the house
only on the days when the big fellows
pitch

  six months passed all that time jim
reach conducted no -the st louis-
colorado express-by night and fanned
by day

  one night when jim reach arrived at the
union station st louis to take his train
out he had a little heart-to-heart talk with
his engineer and fireman will cowan and
hv ryan

   boys said reach  this run to-night
will be my last with you im going back
to a day run

   what  exclaimed cowan  why
the baseball season is just beginning how
will you get off to attend the games  

  ive got to quit the night work cowan
my wife ever since i took the night run
has been at me to go back to daylight
railroading

  the next morning mrs jim reach
helped her three children to dress then
went down to get breakfast she sang
blithely while she fried the bacon and eggs
and mixed the pancakes that morning
jim reach would come in from the very
last of his niglit runs

  some one rang the front door-bell who
could the caller be at that early hour

  mrs reach took off her apron and
opened the front door - to find that her
caller was engineer boyer of the rock
island an intimate friend of her husband

  why mr bover glad to see you
wheres jim

   coming mrs reach yes hes on the
way here

  boyer was taken into the best room
after looking around and playing nervous-
ly with his cap he said

  wherere the children

  in the kitchen why

   oh nothing particular mrs reach
jim will beplaying with them evenings-
now that hes gone back to a day run wont
he but mrs reach ive come to tell you
that-well that-oh yes-that jim and
me were having a long talk last night on
jims pet subject

    boyer he says to me  a good eye
and the ability to time your swing aint all
there is to the art of batting no sir you
must also know how to outguess the pitcher
you must know the twirlers twirls as well
as he knows em himself

   yes mrs reach boyer went on  jim
reach certainly knew-knows-all about
pills and sluggers says he to me

      boyer he says  strength is not really
necessary in a slugger no sir you just
meet the pill squarely with a snap swing
and it will travel just as far as if you
put all your heft behind it

  well mrs reach concluded boyer
ill be bidding you good morning oh
by the way mrs reach i came to tell you
-well now mrs reach did you ever hear
jim speak of a wooden trestle thats on our
run over at union missouri

 no why

  well mrs reach i must tell you-
good morning

  without another word boyer opened the
door stepped out and closed it behind him
leaving mrs reach standing in the middle
of the floor in dumb amazement

   well  she exclaimed  whatever
made sam boyer call on me at seven oclock
ten thousand miles by rail



 cant you see that i ve just ruined my white dress  

in the morning just to tell me that nonsense
about baseball and a trestle at union mis-
souri he certainly acted queer anyhow
meantime boyer went down to the union
station and met his fireman sid gold-
thwaite

  did you tell her asked goldthwaite
in an awed voice

  no replied boyer i just couldnt
you go up there and tell her yourself do
it for me sid like a good fellow

  sure i will said the fireman some
ones got to do it

  an hour later goldthwaite called at boy-
ers home

   did you tell her asked boyer in a
hoarse whisper

  no answered the fireman i just
couldnt beside i didnt need to jim
reachs body had already been carried in-
to the best room and the undertaker was
on the job well boyer that wreck of
 last night was a bad one wasnt it
bill cowan tells me that when he saw his
cars dropping through that trestle he
thought sure that everybody present was
about to cash in

  and to think answered boyer that
not another darned person aboard of that
train was killed except jim

  tim murphy was a huge-hearted engi-
neer and mighty was he in sympathy tim
murphy was on the head-end of the den-
ver flier of the st louis keokuk and
northwestern railway running over the
chicago and alton tracks on this par-
ticular run he was approaching the trestle
near louisiana missouri he cried to his
fireman

  great caisar theres hen baird and
his whole family in the middle of the
trestle 

  murphy put on the emergency the
denver flier gave a series of jolts and jars
which the passengers did not forget for
weeks afterward

   theyre done for-the whole baird
family yelled murphy i cant stop
in time 

  the flier rushed on the trestle toward
the four persons in the middle of it-a
man a woman and two young girls

  that trestle was eighty feet long thirty
feet high and a single tracker on neither
side of the track was there room for the
pedestrians to stand aside for the train
to pass either they must jump to death
on the rocks protruding from the shallow
stream thirty feet below or they must re-
main on the structure to be killed


the railroad mans magazine

   good-by hen  shouted murphy be-
lieving that his train was about to wipe out
the baird family

  even as he said good-by the tears in
his eyes the four persons threw themselves
flat on the ties on the outer edges of the
trestle

  the train dashed by them and came to
a stop with tears now streaming down
his face engineer murphy climbed out of
the cab

   hen baird and his whole family-gone
gone  he wailed

  he ran back expecting to find that the
mangled bodies had been hurled from the
trestle and that he would see them float-
ing down-stream but not a sign of a body
could murphy see

  the train conductor joined him and
murphy trying to force back the tears that
simply would well up out of his soul
sobbed

  and to think this should happen to
me to think that it should be left to
me tim murphy to wipe out hen bairds
family 

  dont cry murphy old boy said the
conductor soothingly  the baird family
is in good health though maybe a little
uncomfortable just at present

   what do you mean   asked murphy
brightening up and wiping away the tears

   i mean that the four of them are ly-
ing flat on the ties under the train they
were taking a sunday afternoon walk-and
got caught here as you see but theyre a
family with presence of mind so they just
lay down and let you run over em theyre
not hurt a bit-only inconvenienced back
the train slowly now murphy so they
can get up and walk off the trestle

  murphy climbed into his cab-and backed
the train very slowly until four figures
uprose in front of the engine

  murphy stopped the train and said to
the bairds

  it was a close call hen murphy
could not keep back the tears

  what you bellerin about murphy

asked baird viewing the engineers tears
in amazement

   i cant help it hen there are two
kinds of tears you see ones for funerals
and the others for resurrections ive shed
both in the last five minutes and you
miss kate turning to the eldest daughter
werent you just scared stiff

  not at all mr murphy thanks im
mad thats all

  mad- what about

   cant you see mr murphy that ive
just ruined my white dress it had just
been laundered isnt it a shame

   so sorry about your dress miss but
now if you four will kindly continue your
afternoon walk and glide off this trestle
the train will then be able to resume
business

  murphy climbed once more into the cab
a tear again stole down his face

  what are you weeping about now
asked the fireman

   theres three kinds of tears boy an-
swered murphy  ive already shed two
kinds this particular kind im shedding
now represents sympathy for folks who find
it necessarv to bluff this game called life
bluff whats that

   i mean sympathy for families that
bluff get called and lose out

  no savvy show me

   dont you see you tallow-pot that these
four bairds were bluffing they pretended
to be all right bet you a gold double-
eagle to a tin dime that by the time they
get home theyll all four of em go to pieces
and call in a doctor

  the next day when tim murphy stop-
ped his train at louisiana he said to the
station-agent

  how are the bairds to-day

  their house is turned into a hospital
mr murphy theyre all down and out
with nervous prostration murphy
asked

   yes

   old tallow-pot said murphy to his
fireman hand over that tin dime

                                   from an old railroad scrap book

                                       the iasi words of engineer edward kennar who died in
                                       a railroad accident near st johnsville ny april  

                                       go flag the train boys flag the train
                                       nor waste the time on me

                                     tis better thus to be 

                                        it was an awful leap boys

                                        but the worst of it is oer

                                        i hear the great conductors call
                                        sound from the farther shore

                                       i hear sweet notes of angels boys

                                      that seem to say  well done 

                                          i see a golden city there

                                        bathed in a deathless sun 

                                         there is no night nor sorrow boys

                                     no wounds nor bruises there

                                     the way is clear-the engineer
                                     rests from his lifes long care

                                      ah twas a fearful plunge my lads

                                    their image rose and smiled

otooles third wreck

           by galvin johnston

       the professors predictions came true but otoole
       engineered the smash-up just to please himself

  i rsis a calm and sultry night
 mused the old switchman
 eft iii i as the yard - crew pressed

     i wk close around the shanty
stove which was white-hot
from the base to the first
joint of pipe the gaunt weather-beaten
faces scowled on him in the infernal glow
while the wintry tempest without raked the
shingles with a flail of ice

  a calm and sultry night mused the
old switchman

  the others struck their foreheads and
drew back and then the speaker was en-
abled to occupy the warmest coziest corner
on an old coach seat in front of the stove

   i wance had an uncle who discoorsed
that way av an avening whispered hogan
 befoore morning lie bit me and we be-
came violent

  his comrades nodded significantly and
edged toward the door

   do ye set vezselfs up as a boord av
lunacy inquired the old switchman with
contempt  some time ye will drive me
mad with stupidity but on this occasion i
will show patience with a great effort i
had another night in mind that wud make
this wan seem tame by contrast but ye do
not know a figure av spache

  whist tis a story and this the night
av nights said hogan  only the while
ago i saw a white wan waving at me
through the snow by the abandoned cars on
the bolivar siding

   aye tis a story averred the other
raising his finger menacingly  the story
av a night that makes this seem wan av
still dews and roses under a summer moon
it was the night av the third wreck on the
ould p d q

  there was a rustling stillness as when
an audience creeps into a darkened play-
house to sit awed arid expectant before an
empty stage the old switchman began

   afther an age av iron coomes an age of
rust and what i have to tell ye is of a time
so long agone that steel rails have rotted
like wood and the fashion in smoke-stacks
has changed four times but i ravmimber
whin terence otoole was a railroad gin-
tleman of the ould school and used to walk
thrack a few steps behint the thrains av the
p d q with a basket on his arm

   as soon as the basket was full av the
bolts and brasses which wud be knocked
out of the cars with the jolting he wud
rayturn to town and sell thim to a broker in
new railroads and thin invite the road-
masther out to drink up his per cent of
profits

   whiniver the road-bed got beaten down
to a level and no bolts fell out he wud
rayport the thrack in bad order and the
road-masther wud sind out a siction-gang
to repair the smooth places it was liurdle-
racers we had for thrains in the good times
i miss thim now though in those days no-
body did

   betwane walking up the track for the
railroad coompany with an empty basket
and returning for himself with a full wan
the otoole made money ivery step of the
way he was a prosperous man and lent
money to the trainmen at high interest

     it must be high for it is all i will iver
get he says and the trainmen made good
his wurrd

   but for all this and iverybody under
obligation to pay him high interest otoole
was not a happy man

     and tis only yezself who can make me
otooles third wreck



wan he tould mrs finnerty who was a
widdy by her second hoosband and owned
the telygraph office at that station

    i have whispered to meself awake i
have shpoken it aloud in my drames that
if i wed again twill be for romance said
widdy finnerty she withdrew her hand
from terrys long enough to answer a tely-
graph-call and demand an apology from the
operator down the line

    tis interoopting me he always is
she says in anger  he is no thrue knight
of the wire

    no thrue what  asks otoole
knight ye numskull sure ye have
no romance

    romance repeats terry   and me de-
caving the road-masther on his percentage
ivery day didnt thirty-wan strike a re-
pair in the track only last wake and thin
rain bolts and washers till she broke down
faith it was like taking a train apart and
i brought back so much of it on a hand-car
that i felt i should have a despatchers or-
der and yet the road-masther got only
sivinty cints as his share though he wanted
a dollar-the gredy divil but why didnt
he get it twas romance saved me mrs
finnerty-romance 

   she raised her head with scorn and dis-
charged a look which staggered him

    bad cess to ye for an ould dragon
says otoole  happy the hoosbands who
have died av ye and i will have ye know
that the otoole will be a romance to no-
body ixcipt the road-masther

   but he had retreated softly from the
room and closed the door behint him befoore
disclosing these sintimints for the otooles
are as sly in the head as foxes

    i retired with dignity he said proud-
ly  and can go back for my hat to-morry
thin it being avening he wint over to
the house of mcgraw the freight conductor
who had been stricken down with katie
malone and had married her in a spirit av
adventure

    ha there is romance here says
otoole standing among the dead leaves
in the yard and listening to an uproar
which came out of the house  i will ix-
amine how it wurruks he goes on knock-
ing loud at the door and looking back to
see that nothing hard to get over was be-
tween him and the gate

  a silence fell inside as if some wan
not without respect in the family had died
suddintly

    tis mcgraw who will not stand for
nonsince muses otoole he has put the
gag on her

   but it was mrs mcgraw herself who
opened the door a crack and says

    gwan with ye polthroon as ye are
wud ye knock out the side of the house in
such an hour as this and me by rights a
widdy 

    a widdy  laments otoole  sorrow
the day thin it was a wake ye were hold-
ing instead of a love-faste

     ah-h-h it is yezself is it  she an-
swers straightening up with a kind of snarl
 ye were that official i thought it was the
call-boy for thirty-five perhaps ye will
coome in she goes on in a bitther suspi-
cious way through the crack av the door

     i wud like to see michael only wance
more whimpers otoole with a kind of
faintness for it was his second widdy that
day and he held on to the new hat he had
bought and thanked the saints there were
no stumbling-blocks to the gate

     i am no knight of romance he reflects
is rapidly as possible  and if necessary
i will take the fence

    and what have ye against my michael
ye human battering-ram says katie
that ye wud see him only wance again
is he not good for a constant companion
cold-blooded money-shark as ye are 

   otoole shudders at the thought

    i wud see him out of interest- he
begins

    ye will not get it till pay-day she
hissed and wud have slammed the door
but mcgraw himself comes up behint in a
white sheet and otoole seeing him falls
into the crack with a gasp

   but they were kind-hearted people who
wud not let even a creditor die on their
hands and be accused of murder drag-
ging otoole inside the parlor they held a
pint bottle under his nose

    the saints be praised i can hold my
own bottle  says otoole  and ye are not
dead at all michael 

    i thought ye were the call-boy ex-
plains katie sourly  and i wud not have
michael go out on the road this night so i
sint him to bed he is a sick man-

     i am not says michael wresting the
bottle away from otoole

    a man near to death is sick katie
tells him in a voice like the crack of doom
then otoole ducked his head and looked
cautiously in all directions for he was not


the railroad mans magazine

the man to coome between michael and a
fate which might be better for him

    ye wud rather be kilt than at home
with me goes on katie in a sob

    thin it will not strike him here says
otoole

    it is time for the third wreck katie
answers  and he is seeking it out plead
with him otoole and she breaks down
entirely

    i will says otoole elevated by the
drink  michael be a man and do as yez
wife commands ye have no romance

   at that wurrd michael laughs in a hol-
low tone and the cedar - tree beyant the
window scrapes the glass with a witchs
laugh but even in the midst of weird
signs and distress curiosity gets the betther
of thim and the two mcgraws stare into
otoole like owls on a halloween

    terence says katie in a soft and
wheedling voice  where did ye get it 

   otoole felt the shivers run over him
at the way they looked

    twas the widdy finnerty gave it me
is it a fatal wurrd to mark me so 

  they stared into him cruel with glee
and otoole goes on to change the subject
in haste

    but that is better than being branded
with superstition there is no third wreck
  listen says katie fixing him with a
long forefinger  first coomes wan wreck
thin another wan which makes two and
after thim a third count thim yezself ye
scoffer it is so on ivery road and we have
had two little wrecks now coomes on a big
wan the profissor who takes thim down
on a blackboard told me so this day he
gets spirits in sayances and harkens to thim
like a man of sinse

    thay arc fools who listen responds
otoole boldly

    the widdy finnerty was there

    who listen and thin belave in it goes
on otoole less boldly for he raysons

 katie will tell the widdy i said this and
 will be out a hat

    arrah listen how he changes his tune
it is noble of ye terence ye have romance
but michael ye have none and wud
rather risk yez life on the road than at
home wurra wurra she chants rocking
back and forth  i am a lone woman he
has no romance

    a curse on ye otoole for bringing
the wurrd into my home growls mcgraw
 it was all happy till ye came

    i heard ye celybrating yez happiness
from the strate says otoole made desper-
ate between the two of thim 

    yis yis it was all happy till he came
sobs katie and thin they thrust otoole
outside and slammed the door against him
without his hat

    tis a fatal wurrd he thinks and
goes home in the winter wind with a hand-
kerchief tied around his head

    i am a practical man he told him-
self over and over before going to bed but
later he drove on in dreams with the widdy
finnerty till the clocks struck midnight and
thin he woke up to be rid of thim

    may the fiends strike ye dumb he
says of the clocks for taking a low advan-
tage of him  ye have set me to struggle
against my fate in an evil hour

    perhaps i am not to blame there is
romance in the blood of the otooles and
my grandfather married his landlords
daughter in kilkenny my curse light on
him he wud rather fall in love than pay
rent he has set me a bad example and i
will go back after my hat to-morry

   and hes awake till the morning whin
he mates widdy finnerty at the door of the
telygraph office

   -woman i have it he says at wance
 romance will crop out in spite of me for it
is in the blood of the otooles

   but she looks on him with a wicked
eye

    sorrow the day we should talk about
romance she answers  whin there is wreck
and destruction hanging over us all

    is it the profissor of ghosts again 
ixclaims otoole in anger  sure hasnt
the wrecking-train been the only wan run
on time since the road was built ye are
as downcast as if the pay - car was in
trouble

    ye think of nothing but loot and sal-
ary says she  do ye niver raymimber the
wurruld of spirits otoole if ye had ro-
mance ye wud sacrifice something to it

    i will sacrifice the profissor of ghosts
threatens otoole  or ye will soon have
him writing out the bulletin-boords in a
trance in a dark room and not a man will
go on the road for fear of the third wreck
 but ever responsive to the call of duty
mrs finnerty answered a telygraph-call
and refused to take a train-order till she had
hung up her cloak

   and otoole worried with the thought
av sacrificing for romance stole his own hat
otooles third wreck



and quickly retired before she could drive
him away

    since every wan is now afraid to run
on thetrack i will not even risk walking
along it he says and goes over to flaher-
tys saloon where the spread of the pro-
fissors prophecy has driven the trainmen to
buy whisky on credit

   he did not see the profissor till late
that afternoon and thin it was through the
windy of the telvgraph office sitting cozy
and comfortable with the widdy finnerty

     he does not look like a man of spirits
and prophecy thinks otoole for the pro-
fissor would not consint to be haunted out of
business hours and whin otoole wint in
he was shaking the fat sides of him

   tis profissor anonymous otoole
says the widdy proudly and terence sat
down to study him

  this is a comfortable man mutters
otoole aside  but tis not meself who can
be fooled with fat and a magic name

    i had an ancestor who was own brother
to ye he says with a kind of cruel chuckle
to himself and well remembering that his
ancestor was the greatest scoundrel out of
county cork

   but the other caught the glame of jeal-
ousy in his eye and smiled in a kindly way

    whist he says while the widdy was
busy at the instrument  some ancestors
must be lived up to and some lived down
i will not expose ye in this wan

  tis a waste of wurrds and yet i have
the worst of it thinks otoole  i must
be cautious for he is a low and crafty man
 my ancestor was a collecthor of ban-
shees he goes on afther reflection

  they are poor craytures replies the
profissor with a yawn  but they were useful
whin paying a landlord-with curses
tis little we know says the widdy
finnerty and otoole agreed with her

     it is betther to nod whin for a shake
i would be thrown out again into the cold
and thin backbitten around a hot stove
the dusk creeps on and they sit dis-
coursing till the road-master drops in and
sinds otoole after his per cent of gin
thin they sip away softly the stove crim-
son hot in their midst while the blizzard
caterwauls in the chimney-fiue

  they tell of ghosts and warnings and
build cozy little wrecks on the floor bay-
fore thim so they stare and are afraid
of wan another in the bloody light and are
ready for another dram of gin

  only vvance does the otoole venture
himself in speech but he rankles with jeal-
ousy of the other guests and thinks

    why did i niver suspect that every

man was crazy about her now i must
hold my own against these ghostmongers
and since i cannot tell even wan tale i will
deny thim all

    there is nothing into it he spakes out
boldly  the trainmen were scared enough
about the third wreck and now with yez
prophecies in the wind they threaten to
murder the call-boy if he finds thim soon
we will have to run our trains wild without
crews or orders

   the other two would have turned against
him for that day it was fated that otoole
should be put outdoors by relays but the
profissor raised his hand

    let him rave on he commands  a
misguided man will wreck himself

   hoo to ye all exclaims otoole con-
timptuous with jealousy and gin  i wud
take out a train meself alone without orders
or signals tis the man of spirit against the
men of spooks

   the profissor gazed at him and the
eyes in his fat face were like two red signal-
lamps twinkling by an open switch

    ye have shpoken ye will be the
third wreck he says in a voice of doom

   being a condemned man the others
went away and left him the two gentlemen
escorting the widdy who looked back at
him wance with a tearful eye so otoole
glowered on by the stove and snarled at the
night operator

   will not go home till after mid-
night he mutters  a curse on the hour
of romance and on after-thought he ex-
tends this to the profissor and the road-
master

  now all that week above the foot-hills
where the station lay wild geese had been
crying to the south from the gray of morn-
ing wurrd had come down the line of
cloud banners flying from the peaks beyant
and of indians who had crept in from the
warpath to smoke the pipe of peace by the
station stoves

  faith the blizzard has arrived on
time mutters otoole as he steps onto the
platform and is whirled around the corner
of the station-house in a tornado of gray
and black

  with head down he plunges up the
track toward home till he comes to the
siding of abandoned cars where the doors


the railroad mans magazine

creak back and forth and the brake-chains
rattle in the wind

    ye black skeletons do ye prophesy
against me too he scowls back at thirn
 sure tis a fine wild special ye wud make
for the third wreck without orders or
signals  he growls as lie goes on

   soon lie is sorry he has spoken so to
thim for at home and in bed he cannot sleep
for dreaming that he is coasting down the
foot-hills on a bad-order special outstrip-
ping the hurricane and the voice av the
widdyfinnerty gives him the thrain order

    meet the first thrain ye come to-
head-on ye are sacrificing for romance

  meet thim head-on cries otoole
starting up in bed with the cold sweat on
his forehead  tis a sign of the times he
says  yisterday i gave up to romance
to-morry i must knuckle down to sacrifice
yet i wud not run into danger except
blindly

   dangerous the wan who broods by pipe
and candle of a stormy night and the
otoole was a man-trap when he schemed

    the profissor has profissed against
me says terence  sure it is this train of
thought which will make a wreck of me

    i have it he chuckles and bites in
two the pipestem  i will yield to the
prophecy and it will be a pitfall to him

   all that next day he chuckles till after-
noon and thin he walks down the track in
clouds of snow till he coomes to the aban-
doned cars

    ould death cells ye are the prophets
special he says to them and knocks out a
coupling-pin four cars from the head end
by which token it is proved that the dis-
turbing dream still ran wild in the brain
of him

   he laughs at the storm on the way to
the telegraph office

   i am in such high humor i wud be
welcome anywhere he thinks  the widdy
will beam with joy to see me and to hear
that i will make any sacrifice for romance
of her

   so he stamps into the telygraph office
and calls  the top of the day as he stands
blinking in the rosy glare of the stove

  there sipping a hot wan sits widdy
finnerty the profissor the road-masther
and the two mcgraws

   here he is again they welcome him
and otoole shrinks with its significance

  do ye not know me he asks i
will show my face by the stove

    we know ye says the road-masther
 have ye any money  

  i have not answers otoole cau-
tiously

   thin ye are an intruder says the
road-masther

   they all look at him but otoole looks
at the widdy finnerty where she sits trim
and pink-cheeked with the black eyes of
her cast down to the floor

    i will have a by-wurrd with ve he
says and defying thim all he leans over and
whispers

    i will sacrifice widdy or do anything
to be rid of romance

   she blushes and startles and the others
leaning forward indifferently overhear the
wurrd

    shame on ye spakes up mcgraws
wife  to be making love in public sure
michael wud niver do so nor at home
either for that matter och hone i am
a lone woman 

     hold i will foretell the fate of him
puts in the profissor sorrowfully

    niver mind commands otoole

    we know it already say the mcgraws
and the road-masther

   ye lie i will not be hung exclaims
otoole  besides the profissor foretold
only yesterday that i would be the third
wreck which ye should be by rights mc-
graw if ye were not afraid to go out on the
road

   they regard him like a jury of crows
on a gallows-tree and thin mcgraw the
wife titters in a sly fashion and whispers
to her husband

    the third wreck she says looking
from the widdy finnerty to otoole and
bringing to mind the two husbands who had
gone before-for she was jealous of the
widdys romance

  mrs finnerty took in the significance
with a kind of gasp her eyes began to
flicker and as she bared her teetli with the
purr of a leopard the sounder on the tely-
graph-table opened up with a crash

  there she was in a minute taking a
message and quivering with excitemint
while mcgraw led out his wife softly and
the road-masther followed thim

    a lantern a lantern  mrs finnerty
began to cry for evening had fallen heavy
and black and streaked with snow

  a lantern says otoole and lights
the two-red and white

    tis this goes on the widdy turning
otooles third wreck



to thim with sharp quick wurrds riley
slipped from the gangway of his engine
while bringing her up the yards at division
station and now she is running wild this
way it is thirty miles she will be up
here in half an hour or less

    with the down passenger due here in
twinty minutes cries otoole grasping the
lanterns is it on time

   during all this she had been calling
on the key but received no answer

    i cannot tell and she throws up her
arms in despair  it is like to be a little
late and the wires are all down with the
storm on the mountain division there
may be no time to get thim into siding ye
must flag thim run-fly-the two of ye
though it is like they will run past your
signal in the blizzard ye must get thim
into the upper siding if possible

  throwing their overcoats at thim she
pushes otoole and the profissor out into
the snow

   they fight their way into the gale and
through the drifts for the tempest has risen
till it seems to have blown the mountains
down and left a clear track from the pole

   it takes some time to reach the aban-
doned cars where the track is swept clear
and slippery by the wind and here the
profissor stumbles over terrys foot and
falls grasping at him the lanterns crash
into bits and they both lie still in the
darkness

  blast ye for a true prophet yells
otoole scrambling to his fate  ye have
predicted evil till ye have brought it to
pass but he laughs in his saycret thoughts
for the runaway engine and the profissors
accident only make perfect the scheme he
already had in mind

    the abandoned cars-the death spe-
cial he repeats aloud and a kind of wild
dream takes possession av him  faith i
will give thim a third wreck which will
split the system wide open

   it is not only excitement which makes 
him grab the profissor by the throat  i
will give him a dose of his own magic he
thinks

    i have a sayance he screeches in the
others ear it is my own ghost i see
beyant and it beckons me to ride down the
wild engine on a death special come
we will throw the switch and whin we are
out ye must close it for the passinger

   they throw the switch and otoole
kicks the blocks from under the wheels of

             

the front car and thin springing up the
ladder runs down the string

    it is lucky this switch is straight up
and down he thinks as he starts for the
front again letting the brakes fly as he
goes  it was like backing thim up a hill-
side to git thim here

   as the last brake lets go a rusty howl
runs along the train and they begin bang-
ing over the switch on the way down the
foot-hills

   i will control thim so they wont jump
at the curves he yells as they pass the pro-
fissor who stands dumb with fright at this
madness and the fear of a strange ghost
 tell the widdy it is the sacrifice she has
given me my orders wurroo wurroo  he
shrieks flinging up his hands  on with
the wind ye old ruins we will strike that
engine like a thunderbolt

  as they sweep past the station the
widdy with starting eyes sees that figure of
swinging arms and a white flapping sheet
of snow and falls in a dead faint across
the telygraph-table

  and otoole the conductor on the wild-
est train that ever dived down the plateau
from the mountain division

   it will be black magic to thim he is
chuckling in spite of the cold and he sets
the brakes on the four cars ahead till they
had slowed down and prisintly he kicks
thim all off wan after another beginning
with the first thin he jumps to the fifth
car and sets the brakes and this being the
point where he had knocked out the coup-
ling-pin during the afternoon the four cars
leave the others behint and shoot off into
the darkness like the black puff out of a
cannon

    the train is too long so i run ye in
two sections says otoole  the first sec-
tion will meet the wild engine and take
siding in the ditch and thin the second
with the conductor aboord will slide down
gently to the scene of wreck

   he had schemed this way of separating
the old cars and thin smashing thim to-
gether again before he had ever heard of
the wild engine

    i would let ye go lickety split now
he says  but a man cannot be expicted to
walk to the scene of his own sacrifice
hereafter i am all for sacrifice and ro-
mance he says going back to the middle of
his train to set a few more brakes

  then something beyond his calculation
happens and there is a crash which pitches


the railroad mans magazine

him off into a deep drift while the old cars
pile up wan after another in a scrap-heap
on top of the engine

  and what has happened ah tis the
black magic of terence otoole which no
wan was iver able to explain but the
secret of the affair is that the four cars
he had turned loose against the engine had
jumped from a curve at that very spot
and the wild engine coming along tamed
down with the cold had smashed into the
second section	 

   whin they ran the passenger train down
slowly to the wreck they found otoole
half buried in snow sitting on the scrap-
heap with his head in his hands and
here was part of the cars piled up on the
engine and two hundred yards further down
was four more cars lying alongside the
track

   the road-masther who had come down
on the train with the profissor considered
all this and asked

  how did ye do it and otoole
with the widdy finnertys arms around his
neck stared at the profissor in the light of
the trainmens lanterns

    i had a sayence he told thim  and
jumped the first four cars over the engine
and thin came down on top it is the best
way to stop an engine but it was all wan
spirit could do

   in the wild ghostly night by the light
of the lanterns no wan knew what to an-
swer for it could not be figured out by a
sane mind at any time

    do ye understhand  cries the widdy
finnerty to the trainmen  he has sacri-
ficed for ye and taken the third wreck into
his own hands

   but she goes on in a whisper to otoole

 i understand still better than thim ye
are a true knight of romance and for the

sake of me ran down a wild engine on a
lunatic train

   with a separate ache from every bone
in his body otoole heard her with indig-
nation

  and she believes me fool enough to
carry romance so far sure i supposed the
box-cars would stay on the track long
enough to smash the engine before i came
up still i will be the safer for that
belief

   so he held his peace on this and only
said  the profissor prophesied that i
should be the third wreck

  well remembering the wurrds of mrs
mcgraw the widdy finnerty turned from
the profissor with scorn  terence otoole
he says looking him squarely in the eye
 what ye have done this night shows ye
need not be afraid to fulfil any prophecies
  i am not answers otoole and he
exulted over his rival

    sure i have belittled him as a pro-
fissor of ghosts he thinks  by relating the
way i raised the cars over the wild engine
he was armed against truth at every point
but i routed him with a lie it is always
best-in the end 

   it was a good tale said hogan with a
sigh  the otoole was a warm-blooded
man

   this night seems like wan on the equa-
tor compared with the night otoole took
out the death special suggested the old
switchman

   it does answered hogan emphatically
 thin ye will not mind running up the
yard beyant the roundhouse and closing the
switch for twinty-sivin 

   that i will not mind answered ho-
gan and lost in thought without overcoat
or gloves he walked forth into the bitter
wind and blinding snow
the worlds greatest juggler

by edwin morris

notwithstanding the historical interest attached to the great engi-
neering achievements of the past we are fast coming to regard even the
great pyramids of gizah as but the work of children compared with the
modern miracles of construction bigger and better is the constant cry and
no matter how startling the demand our present-day engineers have rarely
failed to deliver the goods when sufficient funds were forthcoming

    as mr morris points out in his article give the mechanical engineer suf-
ficient money to work with and there is practically nothing imaginable in the
line of constructive operations that he will not undertake to carry to a successful
completion while no engineer will ever find himself facing the problem of
moving the brooklyn bridge to europe or digging a vent for mount vesuvius
in paris who can tell but what even greater things may some day be asked
of the men who are now at work building skyscrapers tunneling rivers and
moving mountains

impractical feats that engineers have brought within the realm of prob-
ability and the various aids that have helped
them to success

gasp hard when we first see them and forth-
with we begin to marvel at the wonderful
ingenuity that piled so many millions of
tons of stone upon stone two thousand
years from now the natives who live here-
about will wonder why we ever gave a
pleasant word to the pyramid builders when
we had so much greater men for our living
neighbors

  for the mechanical engineer of the pres-
ent day is indeed a wonder his profession
has existed barely a half century but he
lias done amazing things more nearly
perhaps than in the case of any other man
nothing is impossible to him give him
the money and he will do almost anything
that any one wants done

  thats quite a bit to say all of mr
harrimans money wouldnt have enabled
his physicians to prolong his life a second
if the wealth of the world were given to
edison himself he probably could neither
increase nor decrease by one the millions of
 r r	

          little while ago thomas
            a edison suggested that
            manhattan island might
            profitably be more than
            doubled in size by filling
            	up the east river and

digging a new stream five miles back of the
present western water-front of brooklyn

   it would be a very easy thing to do
he said  it would be only a third-rate
engineering feat steam - shovels could
scoop out the new river and trains could
carry the earth and dump it into the old
one they are doing a much more difficult
job out in seattle they are moving a
mountain ive seen them doing it the
mountain was in the way so they are just
pulling it up by the roots and carting it
off

  this is all an old story to mr edison
but most of the world does not yet realize
what a wonderful man is the mechanical
engineer the egyptian pyramids make us


the railroad mans magazine

eggs that are annually laid by a fish but
the mechanical engineer-from what project
would he fly

  i put what i thought was a poser to a
new york member of the profession

  if you were offered enough money i
asked  would you take a contract to mount
the brooklyn bridge on wheels and drag it
across the bed of the atlantic ocean to
europe

  of course i would he replied without
a moments hesitation

   isnt the bed of the ocean filled with
mud-probablv to the depth of hundreds of
feet

a hard nut to crack

  it is in some places but what of it
if money were no object tires so wide could
be put on the wheels that they would not
sink besides if i wanted to i could make
the wheels rest so lightly on the bed of the
ocean that they could almost go oyer egg-
shells without breaking them i could
simply attach big air-chambers to the
bridge let the chambers be submerged and
regulate the weight on the wheels by pump-
ing in water or air

  that sounded pretty good but how
could the bridge be drawn the bed of the
ocean is a succession of hills and valleys
very much like the hills and valleys that we
see on the surface of the earth some
power would be required now and then to
pull the bridge along

   would the seventy thousand horse-pow-
er engines on the mauretania pull the
bridge he was asked

   no they wouldnt he replied  sev-
enty thousand horse-power wouldnt get the
load over the first hill but a seven million
horse-power engine can be made just as
easily so far as the mechanical problem
involved in its construction is concerned as
an engine can to run a coffee-mill

  the only real problem in building an
engine strong enough to drag the brooklyn
bridge across the oceans bed to europe
would be to supply its boilers with coal
the mauretanias boilers use a thousand
tons of doal a day such an engine as i
have in mind might require all the steam
that could be made each day from 
tons of coal

  as the trip across the ocean would re-
quire a good many days it would be pretty
difficult to build a ship of such enormous

coal-carrying capacity but a fleet of colliers
would answer the same purpose

  the project would be simple enough in
principle its difficulty would lie only in
the greatness of the task to which the prin-
ciple might be applied but the brooklyn
bridge could be dragged to europe all
right and if the contractor were asked to
do so and were paid for doing so he could
bring the rock of gibraltar back with him
on pontoons and set it up in central park
-or in kansas for that matter

  what a combination of suggestions im-
agine the consternation of a school of whales
at the sight of the brooklyn bridge a sea-
serpent of steel on wheels but at that
the whales wouldnt have anything on the
english if they were to lose the rock-or
upon the kansans if they were to get it
maybe its a good thing that mechanical
engineers cannot always get all the money
they would need to do all of the things they
could do for instance

   could you take the fifty-story metro-
politan tower i asked move it up
broadway to forty-second street and lay
it lengthwise along the car tracks without
breaking a window or cracking any plas-
ter

  that would be harder than taking the
brooklyn bridge across the atlantic he
replied  but it could be done not only
could it be done but if the timepiece in the
tower were run by a spring instead of by
weights the building could be moved and
laid down on its side without stopping die
clock dont think that i am minimizing
the difficulty of the task i am not

encased in steel

   the building would probably have to
be encased in steel to give it sufficient rigid-
ity to keep it from breaking in two when
it was laid down special appliances of
enormous size would also have to be made
to ease the building down from an erect to
a reclining posture but with no limit placed
upon expense all of these things could be
accomplished

   the tower in fact could be moved
miles across the country the moving of
any building no matter how great is not
an insurmountable mechanical problem
the weight and the height of a building
simply increase the difficulty of applying
principles that in themselves are simple
it is a well-known principle for instance
the worlds greatest juggler



  that a stream of water presses against every
square inch of a piston-head with the same
- intensity that the water is forced through
the pipe

would move mountains

      in other words if a stream of water an
  inch square at a pressure of ten pounds
  to the square inch be pumped against a
  piston-head containing ten square inches
  the pressure on the piston is ten pounds for
  each inch or one hundred pounds this
  rule holds good no matter how small the
  stream of water or how large the piston

      here is a single mechanical principle
  with which one could almost move moun-
  tains put a stream of water an inch
  square and under two hundred pounds
  pressure against a piston-head ten feet
  square and you have a power equal to the
  weight of  pounds enough hy-
  draulic devices of this kind would almost
  drag manhattan island down into the bay

     how about plugging vesuvius as a
  dentist would fill an old tooth and building
  a new subterranean outlet the crater of
  which would be in paris could that be
  done 

      you are getting now he replied  into
  things that are so purely fanciful that the
  mind can hardly conceive them as possi-
  bilities but i suppose there is no reason
  why vesuvius could not be stuffed up and
  a new outlet made if any one wanted the
  job done and had the money to pay for it
  filling the crater would be simply a matter
  of stonework while making a new outlet
  the crater of which should be in paris
  would be only a gigantic job of tunneling

tombs of the royalty

      if the ancients could build the pyramids
  without any power except that of their own
  muscles and the muscles of animals i guess
  we moderns could fill the crater of vesuvius
  if we wanted to by using steam-engines
  and electricity and what is true of the
  stonework would also be true of the tun-
  neling power and machinery will work
  out almost any mechanical problem tun-
  nels were made even before the pyramids
  were built and during the middle ages
  some pretty big works of this kind were
  successfully carried out

    all of which is true the country
  around the nile was the scene more than

twenty centuries ago of the first tunnel-
building when an egyptian king hopped
on the throne his first thought was not of
where he would buy his new touring-car
but of where he would rest his weary bones
when he no longer wanted them to hang his
clothes  he must have a tomb  not a
four-dollar plot in a cemetery with a glass
of pansies on it but a grave hewn out of
the rock with a pyramid over it

  more than that a long tunnel must lead
to the room in which his valuable bones
were eventually to lie and therefore the
first part of the task was to build the tun-
nel on such occasions it was the custom
of the king to sing out to one of his boss
menials

   bill get forty thousand or fifty thousand
men around here right away set part of
them to digging a tunnel and put the rest
of them to work toting stone i expect to
be dead in about sixty years and there is
no time to lose

  that sounds funny but in its essence it
is a fact labor was plentiful-all a king
had to do was to go out and catch what
men he wanted and on saturday nights
no envelopes were ever passed around-but
progress was pitifully slow there was no
machinery no steam-engines no dynamite
no rock-drills

for a rapid exit

  the only wav to get a stone up to the top
was to lasso it with a rope hitch it to a
block and tackle and set all of the men
camels and elephants to pulling getting
through rock was a matter of picks and
shovels sledge-hammers fire and water

  when the work became so hard that the
pick-and-shovel gang were on the point of
knocking off and going out to murder the
king a huge fire was built beside the rock
when the stone became hotter than a burned
boot water was dashed on it which cool-
ing the rock suddenly caused it to crack

  in the middle ages kings and other
particular persons reversed things a bit
they built tunnels not to stay dead in but
to keep alive in the people in those days
had the habit of going out periodically to
lift the kings scalps of course it was a
nervy proceeding and the monarchs resisted

  they provided themselves with suits of
armor also with soldiers who were sworn
to have their whiskers pulled out by the
roots and their brains beaten out with clubs


the railroad mans magazine

rather than see their dear kings breathe
their last but the kings always knew their
soldiers were likely to change their minds
after receiving in rapid succession three
swift kicks so royal genius provided a
means of saving life when honor and the
winter groceries had been lost

  tunnels were built from the -basements of
the monarchical castles to secluded places
in the distance that commanded good views
of the country roads it was doubtless fig-
ured out that the rulers on the pretext of
going don to put coal on the furnace
could grab a prince under each arm open
the tunnel door and beat it for the country
anyway they had tunnels in those days-
some of them a mile long

  during the latter part of the seventeenth
century things began to liven up a little
when gunpowder was first used to cut sub-
terranean passages the french built a
tunnel five hundred and ten feet long at
malpas but the engineer who built it wasnt
much all he couid do was to cut through
stone if he had been told to drive a tun-
nel through soft soil he would have thrown
up his job nobody at that time had ever
tunneled through anything except rock it
was the popular impression that earth if it
were trifled with would cave in

  so it would but these same french in
 found a way to stop it by timbering
the sides they built a tunnel twenty-four
feet wide for the st augustine canal and
not a man was killed really modern tun-
nel-building began on that job

mcadoos  unnels

  but it was not until the coming of the
railroad that the great necessity arose for
roadways under the soil every little while
there came a place where a train ought to
go through a hill rather than around it
between  and  the manchester and
liverpool railroad built two tunnels in
england-the first railroad tunnels in the
world the allegheny portage railroad
company in  built the first railroad
tunnel in the united states

  the english and american engineers
who put these works through undoubtedly
stood high in their professions and quite
as certainly believed they were rare gen-
iuses maybe they were-for their day
but they would have had a nice time driving
a tunnel under the hudson river as mr
mcadoo did

  if work had begun from each side of the
river with the intention of having the ends
of the tunnel meet under midstream it is
doubtful if either crew ever would have
seen the other one crowd probably would
have tapped the river and been drowned
while the other might have gone too far
down and been boring yet however the
two ends of mr mcadoos tunnel came
together within an inch

  machinery and higher professional skill
have alone made such progress possible
since mr mcadoo finished the hudson
river tunnels that connect new york with
jersey city and hoboken machines have
even been invented that can work through
rock more rapidly than can dynamite or any
other explosive

the hardest thing on earth

  a constant bombardment is kept up on
the face of the rock by a multitude of drills
the drills are set in a steel disk of the same
diameter as the tunnel and as the disk is
moved around the entire surface of the
rock is battered down in one operation

  thomas a edison had this machine in
mind when he recently told me that nothing
would so much advance construction work
that must proceed through rock as the dis-
covery of a large pocket of black diamonds

  a black diamond is the hardest thing on
earth beside it a white diamond is a
piece of hickory and a steel knife-blade is
a piece of clfeese because of its exceeding
hardness a black diamond makes the best
cutting-point for a rock-drill mr edison
said he had a diamond-pointed drill that
had worked through a thousand feet of rock
without perceptibly dulling its edge

   i dont know why black diamonds are
so scarce he said  they are nothing but
pure carbon like the white stone but na-
ture does not seem to have made many of
them maybe nature has made a lot of
them and put them in out of the way places
where we have not yet found them i hope-
this is the case certainly the discovery of
a large number of black diamonds would
expedite rock work as nothing else could

  still the modern mechanical engineer
now and then does wonders of the first class
with the present limited supply of black
diamonds

  the rebuilding of the new york central
terminal in new york city is really about
as marvelous an undertaking as would be
the worlds greatest juggler



the dragging of the brooklyn bridge to
europe along the oceans bed tracks are
being juggled around as if they were straws
some trains are running forty feet above
others dynamite and drills are shattering
the solid rock upon which the terminal is to
stand three thousand trains are coining in
and going out every day thousands of tons
of baggage and tens of thousands of pas-
sengers are handled every day and although
the work has been in progress almost five
years no train has been delayed a minute
because of the work and no passenger has
been inconvenienced section-men out in
the country who cannot replace a rail with-
out holding up a freight-train can perhaps
appreciate the magnitude of this achieve-
ment better than can any one else

  to get back to the building-juggling
problem there is at least one man in this
country who believes the time will come
within fifty years when every skyscraper in
new york including the fifty-story metroj
politan tower will be taken down this
man is sidney a reeve an eminent pro-
fessor of steam-engineering a political
economist of note and the author of a book
entitled  the cost of competition

  professor reeve differs from those men
who believe the skyscraper will come down
because it cannot stand up so far as the
strength of its materials are concerned he
sees no reason why tall steel buildings
should not stand for centuries he does
not believe earthquakes electrolysis or tor-
nadoes will ever be sufficient to cause them
to fall

  but he does believe that men will volun-
tarily remove the last skyscraper within
the next half-century for the reason that
the conditions of life will by that time
have so changed that no demand will exist
for extremely high buildings and that their
owners will then remove them buildings
that do not pay interest on the investment
are always quickly transformed he says
into structures that are needed this is
the way he figures out that skyscrapers
must go

  this is the age of barter men congre-
gate in cities to buy and sell the things that
other men have grown or made in the coun-
try or in the smaller towns in the business
of bartering there are such great opportu-
nities for getting money that there is much
competition among the barterers for offices
in which to carry on their work and as
bartering can be done on a big scale only
in the great cities offices have to be built
high into the air to make room for those
who desire to engage in this occupation

  the professor of course may or may not
be right but any time that there is a demand
for the removal of the metropolitan tower
there will be men to do the work even if the
contract calls for the taking away of the
building without tearing away a stone or
knocking a speck of gold-leaf from the dome
if the development of the flying-machine
should render bridges useless the steel
passageway to brooklyn can be wheeled off
to africa as a plaything for baby elephants
provided enough money be forthcoming to
pay the bill

shaky banks comes back

by george foxhall

           how railroad history was made when
           bob malloy met with an accident

khaky banks was not a good
man to fool with on ordinary oc-
casions and there wasnt a man
on the western division who
dared call him  shaky  to
his face but he was shaky
nevertheless everybody knew it
and he knew it himself thats why his
friends never gave him the nickname and
thats why his enemies darent for in the
ordinary acts of life such as a scrap or a
lark shaky had muscles like a tigers and
the precise movements of a prize-fighter

  a fine figure of a man was tom banks
and as fine a fellow as ever eased steam
into a greedy throttle but-shaky in the
flash of emergency some sort of nerve par-
alysis took hold of him and his limbs be-
came like the limbs of an infant -the
same thing gripped his- brain and he
thought and did the wrong thing whenever
the thinking and doing meant property or
life or reputation

  thats why tom was on the extra list at
piermont with mighty little chance of be-
ing called for anything but the way-freight
on the so-called scrap-heap branch

   tom had a girl or more correctly speak-
ing tom had had a girl when it was first
made plain to him that there was something
wrong with his sand he had slipped over
to annie duponts house with his head
down for a man hates to shame his man-
hood in a girls eyes

  annie said he im not the man for
you for you deserve a real man and the
best part of me is missing youve heard
what happened down on the canon curve
yesterday its only by the friendship of
alf hardisty that i shall even manage to
drag along on the extra list i want you
to have your liberty an take a better man

   and not a man in the world is there
with courage like your own said annie
 that would come plain and brave in his
shame to a woman im your girl an proud
of my man that takes the shame where there
is no real blame

  she washed a wayhis trouble with her
tears and cheered him with the sunshine of
her smiles

  but after two years when he had worked
back onto a freight run and it happened
again tom wouldnt kiss the tears away
he walked off with a face like stone and
there were two hearts in piermont that were
as near breaking as brave hearts can be-for
always a brave heart nurses a grain of hope

  this time tom had let a string of loads
down the piermont mountain so fast that
they came in with every axle-box belching
flames and fumes and the wheels on the
rails only by the mercy of providence tom
had gone shaky when he felt them slip-
ping away from him he had made a wild
pull with his left hand instead of with his
right and the left hand dragged wide open
the closed throttle

  by the time the fireman got over and
brought him back to earth tom had more
momentum on those loads than any straight
air in the world would have held on a four
per cent grade and they slipped to the bot-
tom like an avalanche while everything
made for the sidings as fast as steam would
let em

  what was the trouble tom asked
alf hardisty the master mechanic

   my air got away from me alf the
pump failed after the first grade

  and then your nerve went wrong
suggested alf

  tom nodded and went on the extra list
for the second time evervbodv wondered


shaky banks comes back



why he didnt resign and try to make a
living as a truck-farmer some said it was
because he hadnt nerve enough to flag an
angleworm others said it was because he
had so much nerve he was determined to
make good

  then bob malloy broke his leg bob
made history when he broke his leg be-
cause bob handled the fast mail and ex-
press from piermont to cardover it was
just at the period when the great southern
had to melt the rails to keep the con-
tract at length theyd trimmed it down
so fine that they had bob hauling three
mail-cars and two pullmans over one hun-
dred and twenty-nine miles of fair grade
with three stops in one hundred and thirty-
five minutes and it was the general belief
that  other engineer on the division could
have done it

  well bob broke his leg he broke it
seven minutes before the flier was due
for two minutes hardistv racked his brain
for one minute he swore fluently and four
minutes before starting-time he sent for
shaky banks there wasnt anybody else

  you have one hundred and thirty-five
minutes to make it in tom and the same
time to bring number ten back youre the
one to make em if nothing comes up in
any case therell be a man moved from the
extra list to-morrow-up or off

  alf and tom had been kids together but
a master mechanic has a big job to hold
down-and hardisty was grim

  tom nodded he was grim too he
tested his air and his valves picked up his
signals slipped over the points and
streaked down the main line

  at pearl city lie was two minutes behind
schedule having been laid out by a draw
at graytown he was five minutes ahead
and he put in the wait examining the check-
valve which had not been working as it
should he fixed the trouble and pretty
soon they were skimming along on the last
leg of the trip as smoothly as steam ever
moved steel

   i guess well make it tom roared
walt sims the fireman straightening his
stiff back at the top of the worst grade

   i guess so shouted tom smiling

  he cut off the steam and drifted down
with a safe little back pull from the brakes
in five minutes the worst of the run was
over and they were scooting through a level
canon whose boulders were washed smooth
ages ago by a mighty river

  they turned canon curve with a little
whistle of the air and then like a flash
tom pushed the air over to the big hole and
notched the throttle lever up high they
came to a stop on two running streaks of
sand five feet from a pile of ties across the
track backed by a hand-car

  from behind the hand-car stepped two
masked men	

  xne walked to the firemans side ancl
the other to the engineers each of em
introduced himself with just one word
up it has a peculiar little rising in-
flection and when its set on a hair-trigger
and a forty-five bore it is wisdom to obey
without undue loss of time

  that is what tom and his fireman did
they climbed down on the firemans side
sims sullen and tom-shaking in every
limb

  they ranged them side by side while a
third hold-up man went through the pull-
man

   when charlies rustled the passengers
explained one of the train-robbers to the
other  well make these fellows cut off the
pullmans and run the mail-cars a mile or
two up the road then we can settle with
the mail-clerks an grab the registers with-
out interruption

   sure answered the other  here
comes charlie marching the train-crew in
front of him

  toms misery was none the less because
his plight seemed unavoidable he saw his
only chance slipping away after he had
done all that man could do but the mad-
dening discouraging part was this unnerv-
ing fear he wished the men would lower
their guns - those yawning tubes that
seemed gloating over the life they were go-
ing to take he was sick with dread lest
one of them should go off

  a cluster of boulders was behind him
and he ached to steady his limbs by it
the third man came up he was evidently
the chief and a man of a humorous turn

   hustle boys  lie commanded  this
trains behind schedule already and we
ought to have some consideration for the
govment mails rush the eagle eye-why
just take a look at him whats the mat-
ter shaky  

  an electric thrill passed through toms
flesh and blood at the insulting name ac-
cidentally uttered like hot wine his blood
surged from his congested heart and found
his nerves and limbs in one mad rush


the railroad mans magazine

with a lightning stab his hand flashed to a
boulder beside him and with all his enor-
mous strength he bridged the distance to
the bandit with a streak of white so quick
was the movement and so fast and true the
throw that no man thus surprised could
have dodged the missile

  three pounds of boulder took the robber
between the eyes

  almost before it struck tom had leaped
with a strangling clutch and an irresistible
backward pressure he snapped the life out
of the first speaker and dropped him to the
ground to turn on the other man who was
making a panicky exit from the scene

  it was a race in which tom never start-
ed this was his day for thmklng and
doing the right thing he dropped to one
knee wrenched the pistol from the hand of
his second victim and fired twice the
first shot missed the second took the run-
ner just above the shoe and he dropped

   come on boys  shouted tom  rush
these fellows into a car and lets get the
track clear ive got seven minutes to

make up in thirty-five miles an im in
some hurry

  tom flashed over those thirty-five miles
as if he were going through a fire and he
was dead on time he had depopulated the
bandit community when he reached home
that afternoon most of piermont was out
including a brass band and a drum-and-
fife brigade but you really couldnt hear
the music there were only eight moguls
in the yards at the time but four factory
whistles helped em to make a noise

  tom looked over the heads of the crowd
grinning then he dropped to the ground
and pushed a lane to where two little soft
hands were waiting to fall into his grimy
ones he held them for a minute of won-
derful tenderness and then because he
couldnt trust himself he turned laughingly
to answer alf hardisty

  how about the hoodoo asked alf

   oh say laughed tom  ive got the
indian sign on that when you see trouble
coming keep cool but dont stop to think
till youve slammed him in the slats

robbed as he calls for help

    his is nolan operator at highland i
am being held up i was sitting here a
few minutes ago when a young man wearing a
light overcoat came in had revolver held
me up said he would kill me if i resisted hes
holding gun at my head now

  this was the message that despatcher gleisner
in the local west shore terminals received to-day
as he was sending train-orders

   go on im listening he ticked over the
seventy miles to highland

  he thinks i am sending regular messages
nolan replied  told me to keep right on with
my work for gods sake send help

  with frantic energy gleisner called up the
west shore offices at cornwall and poughkeepsie
just across the river from highland by the time
lie had gotnolan on the wire again police-squads
were forming in both of these places to go to
nolans aid

  whats doing now gleisner asked nolan
 hes still here came the reply  he has
no idea i called you up

   im sending help flashed gleisner

   im still at work ticked nolans key  so
is highwayman has his gun pointed at me he
says  keep ft-work or ill drill you im pretty
badly scared he is now going toward safe
it is unlocked now he opens it he ransacks
the safe watching me all the while he takes out
the money and tickets putting them in his pocket
he is walking back toward me he says stay
where you are if you move in less than five
minutes after i leave here you will be a dead man
he backs toward the door

   hold him if you can urged gleisner

   im trying nolan said  i am asking him
to remember that he is losing me my job and am
arguing with him he says he is sorry cant
hold him any longer now hes gone

  then at the end of five minutes nolan wired
 hes gone for good i guess i followed him
out but he got away in the dark

  the posse from cornwall was soon at the
station they found a white-faced operator and
a safe that had been relieved of one hundred and
seventy dollars besides several bundles of tickets

 how i ran the general

by william j knight

the true story series the much-mooted question as to
whether the plucky little locomotive which now stands in the union
station at chattanooga tennessee a relic of the civil war was ever
known by any name other than that of  general is finally settled herewith

     the last word comes from mr william j knight the engineer who actually
 held the throttle of the pursued locomotive during the wildest and most impor-
 tant race ever run on wheels mr knight is one of the few surviving veterans
 who took part in the andrewss raid into the confederate lines he has given
 us a railroad mans version of the famous run which we hope will clear up any
 doubts which may have been previously held by our readers

     in a personal letter to the editor of the railroad mans maqazine mr
 knight states positively that the engine he ran over the rails of the western
 and atlantic railroad from big shanty to ringgold bore the name of  gen-
 eral and that any other name which has since been applied to it is erroneous

     the raiders anticipated sherman by two whole years had they been suc-
  cessful the march to the sea might never have taken place but they failed and
 many of them paid the penalty of their daring with their lives

true story number fifty-four

thrilling experience of a handful of federal soldiers who took part in
the capture of a confederate locomotive told by
the man who handled the throttle

 it was after dinner during dress parade
 when our colonel after a word with captain
 l e brewster stepped up in full view of
 us and said in a tone of command

if there is any man in company e who
knows how to handle a locomotive let him
step one pace to the front

        well remember that day in april
            when i first learned that
           i was to figure in an expedition
           to capture a confederate railroad
           train-an expedition which has
           since gone down in history as
           the most thrilling succession of events that
           ever occurred on rails of steel


the railroad mans magazine

ing work might be in store for me i stepped
forward and on being told to report at
headquarters immediately after dismissal by
the captain i resumed my position in the
ranks until drill was over

  i was then a private in company e of
the twenty - first ohio infantry which
along with the thirty-third and second
ohio regiments had encamped at shelby-
ville tennessee as i was soon to learn for
the purpose of sending a secret expedition
through the enemys lines to tear up the
track and destroy bridges on the western
and atlantic railroad between chattanooga
tennessee and atlanta georgia

  most of the recruits and supplies for the
western wing of the confederate army were
transported from atlanta to chattanooga
over this line and therefore it was the
object of the federal leader to cripple it and
tie up all traffic as soon as possible

   at the colonels quarters where i hurried
with captain brewster as soon as dress
parade was over i was introduced to james
j andrews a kentucky scout who at once
unfolded to me his daring plan to capture
a train at big shanty and run for the union
lines leaving a trail of blazing bridges
behind him

off for big shanty

  as we stood studying the map the scheme
looked plausible enough i readily volun-
teered to go and take my chances with the
rest of the boys who had signed up i was
told to put on citizens clothing with which
i was provided and be prepared to meet
andrews and his party just after dark at a
point south of shelbyville

  i did as directed that night twenty-
two of us in small parties set out for chat-
tanooga in the rain we got through the
confederate lines easily enough by telling
the pickets we were from kentucky on our
way to join the southern army and arriving
in chattanooga three days later we boarded
a train for marietta journeying southward
over the road we were planning to cripple

  we still traveled singly or in groups of
two or three pretending not to know one
another as the cars we rode in were full of
confederate soldiers whose suspicions might
easily have been aroused had we appeared
to be too well acquainted

  the way they talked about being ready
to eat up every yank in the union made
it hard for us to keep from starting a free-

  for-all fight then and there but we bided

our time however and when we passed big
shanty where we were later to capture our
train more than one of us turned to pass the
wink to his neighbor

  we stayed at marietta that night and at
five oclock the next morning which as i
remember it was april   we board-
ed a north-bound train for big shanty we
still traveled in little groups studiously
avoiding each other though we knew that
our-time of secrecy was close to an end

  i sat with several companions near the
front of the car next to the engine and on
looking around saw that the other members
of our party had all taken seats behind me
it was not an easy matter to appear uncon-
cerned knowing that in a fewminutes we
might be called upon to battle for our lives
against heavy odds for we all felt that if
caught we would be treated as spies and
hanged without mercy

   big shanty twenty minutes for break-
fast finally came conductor fullers call
and the train soon slowed down and stopped
before a little one-story station that served
as a ticket office and eating-house for the
trainmen and passengers

  the moment had arrived for us to put
our daring plan into execution i say
daring feeling that i am not overstepping
the bounds of modesty for at that time
there were confederate troops camped close
to the station and picket lines enclosed us
on every side

  our party filed out of the car with the
rest of the passengers but by a precon-
certed plan andrews and i alighted on the
opposite side of the train and made our
way toward the engine keeping out of sight
as much as possible

  by the time we had reached the cab we
found that the engineer and fireman had
both gone to their breakfast

making a getaway

  were lucky they didnt stop to shake
down their fire and oil around said an-
drews as we crouched beside the tender
 it looks as if we can get away without
firing a shot you run back and uncouple
these forward box cars from the rest of the
train and well pull out immediately we
can make better time without the other cars
and the men can keep out of sight in them
when we run through stations

i hastened to obey and going back
how i ran the general



pulled out the pin between the third and
fourth cars so that when we pulled out we
would leave the heavy baggage and passen-
ger coaches standing on the track a sentry
was pacing up and down the platform with-
in ten feet of where i stood but i managed
to dodge behind the cars and get back to
where andrews was waiting without his
seeing me

  by this time our little party had collected
near the open door of one of the box cars
at a nod from andrews who now leaped
aboard the engine i followed while john
and alf wilson who was to sefve as fire-
man and w w brown my assistant
swung on from thfe opposite side

  the gage showed plenty of pressure and
a white feather was going up from the steam-
dome

  into your car men quick called
andrews let her go knight

the throttle open

  i jerked open the throttle we leaped
ahead like a shot looking back i could
see the last man of our party being hauled
head-first into the freight-car while out of
the station poured a stream of passengers
and trainmen shouting and waving their
arms in a wild state of excitement

  we soon disappeared from their sight
around a curve and ran down the track a
couple of miles spying a crowd of section-
men at work ahead of us andrews called
out to me

  stop just this side of those fellows
well get their tools and tear up the track
while scott cuts the wires 

  andrews had no fear of a message being
sent on ahead from big shanty to intercept
us as there was no operator there but
feeling that a message might already be
speeding back to marietta-the nearest tele-
graph office-andrews thought it wise to
be on the safe side when we came to a
standstill andrews went ahead to where the
gang was working and ordered them to turn
over their tools

  i could see that there was some argument
at first but they finally did as directed
without any show of resistance though they
were probably greatly puzzled at his com-
mand

  after a stop of several minutes during
which the wires were cut and a rail taken
up we started on again we were consid-
erably ahead of the regular schedule so in

  order to pass a train at kingston which we
knew was coming our way we slowed down
somewhat but whenever we came in sight
of a station i would pull her wide open and
go through like the wind

  it was amusing to see the amazed looks on
the faces of the passengers who stood with
their grips in hand waiting to board our
train when we shot by at lightning speed

  andrews had planned to burn the bridge
over the etowa river but fearing that we
had stopped too long already we crossed it
and sped on through etowa where we
passed a locomotive standing under full
steam on a branch line that ran to an iron-
mine i suggested to andrews that we had
better stop and disable this engine in case
we were pursued but lie refused to do so
it was there that we made our worst mis-
take for had we carried away some part of
the mechanism of the old  yonah con-
ductor w a fuller and his party could
never have followed us as closely as they did

  andrews unfortunately did not know
that on that very day general o m mitchell
had captured huntsville and instead of
there being only two trains for us to pass as
we had figured there were three times as
many the railroad having started all its
rolling-stock south to prevent its capture by
the federal troops we kept on speeding
and loafing until we reached cass station
noticing a wood-pile and water-tank beside
the track we stopped and replenished our
fuel and water as both were beginning to
run low

   i dont recollect ever seeing you fellows
before said the station-agent whose name
i afterward learned was russell when we
climbed down out of the cab

   what have you got in there  he asked
pointing to the closed box cars

powder for beauregard

  you just drop a few sparks from that
pipe of yours inside and youll find out
soon enough returned andrews  theres
powder enough in those cars to blow you
and your station into the middle of next
week were hustling it through to beau-
regard to shoot holes in yanks with

    oh thats your lay is it  said russell
 hope you get through with it all right
the federals aint far off and if they stop
that peanut-burner of yours youre pretty
sure to find out what the inside of a prison
looks like

   were taking our chances said i  but
id hanged sight rather have the yanks
get me than run into a head-on with a south-
bound train weve lost our schedule and
if we dont get one pretty quick were going
to have trouble havent you got one we
can have

   sure said the tank-tender after
searching his pockets he finally located a
soiled piece of paper which he handed to
andrews

  as the men in the box cars had been
ordered to keep out of sight until signaled

to come out andrews wilson brown and
i got down and piled a good supply of wood
on the tender

  after filling the tank we pulled on up
the track out of sight where we stopped
and while john scott who did the wire-
cutting climbed a telegraph-pole and shut
off telegraphic communication the rest of
the men at andrewss order piled railroad-
ties upon the track to obstruct any one who
might follow us

  reaching kingston andrews repeated his
tale to the station-agent about carrying
powder tof beauregard and gave orders to
the switchman to let us in on the siding to
wait for a south-bound train which we
knew must pass before we could proceed

how we lost an hour

  for twenty-five minutes we fumed and
fretted watching the southern horizon for
the smoke of a pursuing locomotive when
the train from the north finally hove in
sight and pulled up beside us our hopes
took another drop for there on the last car
flag-signals were flying to show that another
train was following

  we waited for over an hour while two
more trains pulled by before we were finally
given a clear track to adairsville and there
was a general sigh of relief when we pulled
out on the main line

  a short distance north of kingston we
stopped to block the track again and take on
a load of railroad-ties some of the men
smashed a hole in the end of the rear car
and when we got under headway again
they dropped the heavy timbers one by one
upon the track behind us

  the outlook now seemed considerably
brighter and our spirits rose perceptibly
had we known then however that only a
few minutes behind us tearing along the
rails was an engine bearing captain fuller
and a corps of confederate soldiers armed
with rifles against which our short-range
pistols were useless we would not have felt
so cheerful

  about four miles from adairsville at
andrewss order we stopped again some
of the men went back and tore up one rail
while the work of track-destruction was go-
ing on those of us in the engine kept watch
and strained our ears for sounds of pursuit
when suddenly we were filled with alarm
by a low whistle coming faintly to us down
tlie track
how i ran the general



   every man back to the train theyre
after us yelled andrews to the workers
who were busily battering out spikes and
bending the rails there was a wild scram-
ble for the box cars and as soon as every
one was aboard i opened her up and we
sped on toward adairsville

tied up again

  a freight-train with signals showing an-
other train behind it was standing on the
main line when we pulled up to the station
so we took the siding and waited with our
hearts in our throats for the second section
to arrive

  fortunately for us it was not long in
putting in an appearance but on arrival it
stopped directly across the switch over which
we must pass to enter the main line again

  andrews hurried over to the conductor
and asked him to pull up and let us by but
he refused insisting that if we proceeded
we were in danger of colliding with another
train which was following and which he
was sure had already left calhoun the sta-
tion ahead of us

  andrews had it hot and heavy with this
man for some time but on promising to send
a flagman ahead at every curve the con-
ductor finally consented to let us move on
without our having to use force

  as soon as his last car had left the switch
andrews pulled it open and swung aboard
as we dashed out onto the main line

   keep her hot boys  he yelled to brown
and wilson who were hard at work heaving
the heavy cordwood into the fire-box

   give her every ounce shes got
knight he shouted raising his voice
above the barking of the exhaust and the
roar of the wheels  death in a wreck is
better than hanging theres no time for
a flagman now 

  we took one curve after another at top
speed ready for the worst until we would
gain a clear stretch of track and get a
glimpse far enough ahead to see that we
were not running into a head-on smash

courting a collision

  behind us the men in the box cars were
tossed about from side to side momentarily
expecting to leave the track and be hurled
to destruction when we went into the ditch
had we been but a few moments later a
wreck would surely have occurred as it

james j andrews of flemingsburg kentucky
leader of the andrews raiding party

executed in atlanta georgia

june  

was we pulled into calhoun just in time
to see the passenger-train for which we had
so long been straining our eyes pulling out
of the station toward us

  as soon as the engineer saw us he started
back toward the depot but when he per-
ceived that we were slowing down he stopped
with his pilot-trucks on the frogs of the
switch which opened into the siding block-
ing the rails so that we could not get by

  andrews repeated his powder story but
the conductor and engineer were both so
angry at him for taking chances of a col-


the railroad mans magazine

lision that they refused to listen and would
not budge an inch

   it looked for a few minutes as if andrews
would have to call out his men and move
the train out of the way himself but his
demands were so positive that the conductor
finally yielded and told his engineer to back
off the switch far enough to let us by

  we now felt that if we could get to the
oostanaula bridge in time to destroy it the
race would be won more wires would
then be cut and other bridges burned with-
out fear of pursuit for we knew that gen-
eral mitchell was close to chattanooga and
were sure that we could easily make our
way to his forces

  as we had made the nine miles from
adairsville to calhoun in seven and a half
minutes we felt that we had now gained
enough headway on our pursuers to stop
and cut wires and tear up the track scott
was soon at the top of one of the telegraph-
poles sending the wires whipping down to
the ground while andrews and the rest of
the men began taking off fishplates and
pulling out spikes

how fuller followed

  they had not been long at work how-
ever when around a curve only a few miles
down the track i suddenly sighted the
smoke of a locomotive

  it was running toward us at full speed
i yelled to andrews that we must be on our
way

  some of the men had pried loose the end
of a rail and in their haste were stumbling
about dropping their tools and getting in
each others way

   give me that bar and all of you get
aboard  yelled andrews snatching a crow-
bar from one of the men

  while the rest of the party scrambled
back into their  side-door pullmans an-
drews struggled and wrenched at the un-
wieldy rail seeking vainly to bend it out of
place and tear it from the ties

  then seeing that the locomotive was
almost upon him he dropped the bar giv-
ing me the signal to go ahead he sprang
for the hand-rail and swung himself aboard
the last car

  with the fire flying from her drivers i
gave the  general  every ounce of steam
in her boilers and we tore ahead i glanced
backward from time to time to make sure
that we were keeping out of rifle-range

  it seems that as soon as we pulled out of
big shanty-as i afterward learned from
reports and from conductor william fuller
himself when we met at a soldiers reunion
at columbus ohio after the war-he and
his engineer jeff cain together with an-
thony murphy then foreman of the western
and atlantic railroad shops had started
out after us on foot

  they ran until they met the section-gang
whose tools we had taken and securing a
hand-car from them they hurried on after
us until they reached etowa where they
boarded the  yonah  and continued the
pursuit they had no trouble in passing
the break in the rails beyond cass station
with the hand-car as they had rolled it
over the ties and soon had it on the track
again

  at kingston being unable to get by the
two freight-trains which we had passed
there fuller and his party ran around them
on foot and boarding the engine rome
which was standing on a side-track started
on again as we had not stopped long
enough to destroy the track again until near
adairsville fuller who had now been
joined by a number of confederates had lit-
tle trouble in getting that far with the
rome here he abandoned the yo-
nah and a little farther on meeting an-
other train we had passed he made the crew
back with him into adairsville where he
secured an engine called the  texas and
again started on our trail catching his first
glimpse of us when we stopped just north of
calhoun

  we soon lost sight of our pursuers but
knowing that they were still only a few
minutes behind us we could readily see
that if we delayed at any of the stations
ahead we would be caught like rats in a
trap

  too closely followed to stop at oostanaula
bridge which we had planned to fire we
sped on dropping ties on the track behind
us but we were now going so fast that most
of them bounded off when striking the
ground and impeded the progress of the
texas but little

fighting with freight-cars

  every time we reached the end of a
straight piece of track we could see the
confederate engine tearing after us reach-
ing the top of an incline near resaca
we uncoupled our last car and i reversed
how i ran the general



and shot it down toward them engineer
bracken however also reversed and caught
the car without its doing any damage to the
texas then pushing it ahead of them
they came on after us

  again we repeated our tactics but they
again caught the empty car side-tracking
the two at resaca through which we ran at
lightning speed their delay gave us a
little more headway and a few miles out
of town we dared stop long enough to cut
the wires again fearing that if fuller could
manage to send a message on ahead of us
some station-agent would side-track us

  not having time enough to tear up the
track when we stopped for wood near til-
ton six miles north of resaca the men
placed the rail which we had carried with
us from near cass station diagonally across
the track wedging one end of it tightly

  the engineer of the texas sighted it
in time and stopped his locomotive

  the other side of tilton through which
we passed in safety we filled our tank and
took on more wood while some of the men
went back a short distance and obstructed
the track to insure another full stop of the
texas out of gunshot range

  as often as we dared to stop the men
got off and cut wires and blocked the track
but not once did they more than get started
to remove a rail before the roar of the
texas speeding toward us would reach
our ears and we would have to dart on at
full speed once we halted in full view of
a regiment of confederate soldiers but not
long enough to give them a chance to come
after us we were constantly in sight of
captain fullers party now and some of
them tried to pick us off with their rifles

  in spite of the closeness withwhich our
enemies hung upon our heels however

he was a

several months ago an old railroad man out
in seattle was caught between the bumpers
of two box cars he didnt have many friends
and none of them did anything for him he
went to a hospital it took his last dollar to save
his left leg but he-was hopelessly crippled
turned out of the hospital broke and discour-
aged the old man could not find employment

  he sought relief in the courts after a hard-
fought legal battle the old man was awarded
 he didnt get all of this his attorney
had to have his fee but what little he did have
the old man put into the illinois lodging-house
he couldnt make it go

andrews had not given up hope of accom-
plishing the work he had set out to do and
was still intent upon burning the first
chickamauga bridge twelve miles north of
dalton though fuller was quite determined
that he should not

  on we sped through the tunnel at tunnel
hill where i begged andrews to abandon
the engine arid either turn it loose back
through the tunnel toward the texas or
send it on ahead for fuller to follow he
would agree to neither plan however but
ordered the men to set their one remaining
car on fire and come aboard the engine
this they did pouring oil upon its walls
and floors and we left it blazingon the
middle of chickamauga bridge

  but again luck was against us it had
been raining and the fire burned so slowly
that by the time fuller arrived on the scene
the bridge had not yet caught he had no
trouble in pushing the blazing car ahead
of him to ringgold where he side-tracked
it here the alarm was given to the local
militia some of whom boarded the texas
when it again started after us

  there is little more to tell wilson had
thrown the last stick of wood into the fire
and the water was not showing in the gage
soon we were only running twenty-five miles
an hour then twenty then fifteen and then
came andrewss command

   stop her knight scatter boys its
every man for himself now 

  history has recorded the rest we were
all taken captive in the woods by the con-
federate soldiers not far from where we
abandoned the  general

atlanta prison eight others including
andrews were hanged -as spies and the
remaining six were exchanged

           ate johnson hobo com-
            pleted his seventeenth somer-
            sault head downward in the
            mud against the barb-wire
            fence he reversed himself
            clawed the nebraska soil
            from his face and looked about him in the
            dark the chicago flier was in the ditch

  fate glanced over the wreck with a sort
of proprietary solicitude for the particular
pullman from the roof of which he had just
alighted it lay on its side crossways of the
track

   hit something remarked fate as he
leaned against the fence and felt in his
pockets for the makings of a cigarette the
wreck was in an uproar but fate having
little use for uproars from long experience
struck a match shielded it from the stiff
night breeze and puffed carefully

  the flare of the match showed him some-
thing caught on the fence-wires near him
fate moved along the fence to investigate

by sumner lucas

an episode in frenzied banking that
isnt quite so impossible as it sounds

 to a hobo who has nothing and
everything to gain fate knew that
he had added to his cipher of
wealth gathering in the bundle
fate started to circle the wreck and
go down the tracks on foot a thing
sorely against his professional pride
but it was dark and the wreck
might be accepted as an extenuating
circumstance

   before he hit the rails he stumbled
over another bundle picking up
this one he began to count the ties
to the east fate had no particular
destination except to get out of ne-
braska it was harvest - time and
work was too plentiful and insistent
for fates daily comfort a mile
down the track he saw a dim straw-
stack off to the left and he turned
toward it

    burning some he said to himself as he
glanced back at the glare of the wreck
stowing his bundles away he  hit the hay
in two minutes he was sound asleep

  just at daylight the wrecker tearing by
awoke him

   late commented fate to its ponder-
ous crane then he stretched himself and
in the gathering light proceeded to examine
his newly acquired possessions he un-
wrapped the first one and stopped to scratch
his head

ambulating orphan asylum he grunted as

  the next was one of the hammocks used
in the lower berths of a pullman to hold the

 match also a small hand-grip containing a
 ladys toilet articles

   ah cooed fate as from the  inside
pocket of the carefully folded vest he pulled
a long seal - leather pocketbook  lets
see who i am  the honorable boyd hill
kingston and five hundred to the good
in long-green yellow-back fifties-and a
draft on new york for-suffering je-hos-
safat one hundred thousand dollars
there were other papers that fate john-
son hobo seated there by the stunned baby
examined with interest

    time to move kid he smiled he pro-
 ceeded to wash the mud from his face in
 the puddle formed by the nights rain and
 to array himself in his new clothes

   good fit commented fate as he looked
 himself over critically

   picking up his other bundle gingerly
fate in all his glory started for a town he
could see some three miles to the south to
get to it he had to cross the track which he
did with his usual modesty by means of a
gully and a culvert

   there was high scandal and various
speculations in that town that day and for
some days to come-in fact it never quite
died out-when an infant dressed in dainty
clothing with but one blue leather shoe
was found on the doorstep of the bachelors
club the doorway looked prosperous to
fate and he wanted to do the best he could
for the boy

   babies were one of the few things that
had not come within the rather extended
experiences of fate johnson

   now good-by to fate johnson hobo
enter the alias hon boyd hill kingston
banker

   traffic center is a city somewhere be-
tween chicago and st louis that eve-
ning a rather gaunt gentleman in black
frock coat pearl-gray trousers with a clean
shave and otherwise adorned and with his
right hand bandaged in black silk leaned
over the register of the palace hotel laid
down a card and said just six words

    register me hand hurt dinner on  

   ignoring the over-friendly inquiries of
 the bland clerk fate with just a suspicion
 of haste entered the brilliant dining-room
 while the clerk wrote on the register  boyd
 hill kingston san francisco and as-
 signed him to the best suite in the house

   later the head waiter noted that mr
kingston had given the largest tip of the
evening and had also ordered and eaten a

     	r r

most elaborate dinner the news spread-
as only such news does-through the hotel
and the gentleman was rated accordingly

  nor were they surprised next day to learn
that the silent gentleman had bought the
controlling interest in the private banking-
house of  davenport  co the price
was said to be one hundred thousand dollars
on which he held an option

  but surprise did come when they learned
the next evening that the generous gentle-
man had also acquired the controlling
ownership of the state bank whose capital
was five hundred thousand dollars with de-
posits of over two millions

  surprise grew to utter amazement and the
talk of the town when within three days
this self-same gentleman had literally
bought every bank in the city there was
much talk in the papers of  the representa-
tive of western capital himself immensely
wealthy who has cornered the banking busi-
ness of traffic center the papers spoke

time to move kid


the railroad mans magazine

with something like awe mingled with en-
thusiasm of his  breezy western way of
doing business the  take-it-or-leave-it yes
or no  methods so characteristic of life in
san francisco

  then came the earthquake but to all
inquiries the gentleman was equally taci-
turn he gave but one interview which
was spread over the front pages of the fol-
lowing sunday papers thus sold out
bought here

  fate was having the time of his life
there had been a fierce business-war on in
traffic center for two years which focused
in the two big banks the first national and
the second national the first morning in
town fate had walked into the banking-
house of davenport  co wasted no
words identified himself with certain pa-
pers laid down his option on the banks
stock with a draft on new york for one
hundred thousand dollars and had taken
immediate possession

  he signed all papers by merely touch-
ing the pen with his injured hand while
another guided it from davenport 
co where he was now czar fate had be-
gun to make those financial moves that
awoke the town his fame spread by wire
to all financial centers and especially to
chicago from davenport  co he
had walked into the state bank right into
the presidents private office and announced
himself with

  you own this bank

  well-er-yes why whom have i
the pleasure of addressing  

    control  

   yes sir

  how much

   well er-really my dear sir i hadnt
thought exactly of selling have you an
offer to make  

  half million

  the president and principal owner of the
state bank had considered a moment here
was an offer really above the value of the
bank and a good chance to get out of the
bitter fight then raging at its worst and to
get out with profit

    ill take it lie said

   immediate possession said fate as he
wrote a cashiers check on  davenport sc
co for nearly all the cash on deposit in
that old and staid institution

  in an hour the deal was closed and fate
reigned supreme in the state bank as in
 davenport  co

  with two million of deposit over half in
cash on hand fate then moved on the first
national he bought a fift-five per cent
ownership in the first next day paying for
it out of the vaults of the state bank

  with the first he now had over five mil-
lions at his command and with this he
bought the second national for a million
cash outright

  endless chain remarked fate as he
went to his bed saturday night-the night
of the fourth day

  fate johnson hobo now controlled
something like ten million dollars over one-
third of it in cash and owned all the banks
in the city of traffic center that ended
the long and disastrous financial war

  monday morning the news that the
financial war was over in traffic center
was known and approved in all the big
financial centers of-america when fate
-beg pardon the hon boyd hill kings-
ton and fate was very particular about
this-when he was asked what his plans
were he replied in a word and a half

   consolidated

  he did so that day certain papers
which should have gone to washington
fate put in his pocket

   less trouble was his verdict after an
hours study

  the ending of the financial fight had a
wonderful effect on the business of traffic
center real estate rose from ten to twen-
ty-five per cent business blocks the leases
for which had stood trembling on the out-
come of the war were promptly rented at
a sharp advance the nail factory reopened
with a pay-roll of eight hundred men

  fate loaned the flour mills fifty thousand
dollars and their doors opened to eleven
hundred employees merchants wired -for
bills of goods held in abeyance and doubled
others the huge lake national bank of
chicago closed a deal with the new  con-
solidated bank-otherwise with fate
johnson hobo-and put two millions on
deposit fate made loans freely but al-
ways through his cashiers the big man
must not be disturbed with details

  naturally he became a target for char-
ity beggars to all he gave a silent frown
and turned away-all except one when
the rev mr huntington mentioned or-
phans fate jerked out

  whats that

   we have one hundred thousand dollars
pledged by mr gotrox of new york for
fate johnsons financiering



an orphan asylum in traffic center if we
can raise another hundred thousand we
have fifty thousand already raised in cash
her and the gotrox money is in a new
york bank ready for us the moment we
can show our hundred thousand in cash
here but the time is up at noon to-day-
and it is now eleven oclock mr kings-
ton-

  all right said fate johnson hobo

  that settled the matter the gotrox
money was forwarded by wire at fates
expense the kingston junior orphan
asylum association  was organized a site
was bought for ninety thousand cash-
which fate generously gave as an after-
thought-and the whole matter settled and

  next day the babies began to come-first
one then by dozens fate paid the bills

  the four banks which fate had cornered
held between them over one million in fore-
closed real estate the sudden revival of
business and confidence supported by re-
ports of niore millions yet to come the oil-
ing of the wheels of trade and the new
steam put into every line enabled the banks
to sell their heretofore dead real estate and
mortgages at a boom profit of nearly half a
million dollars

  there were some croakers in town but
these timid and suspicious gentry with too
many questions to ask were promptly
frowned down as enemies to the prosperity
which had struck traffic center

  on the tenth day fate johnson hobo
millionaire and benefactor of traffic city
was calmly eating his dinner when an ex-
cited gentleman followed by the chief of
police and a patrol-wagon full of club-
swingers rushed through the stately portals
of the palace hotel all doors were in-
stantly guarded a frontal attack was
made on the dining-room fate looked up
and calmly went on eating-

  thats him hes the scoundrel-thief
-forger thats him  yelled the one and
only original hon boyd hill kingston

  fate helped himself to the peas

  the chief of police stopped and looked at
him in admiration

  say you youre wanted he man-
aged to blurt out a trifle disconcerted and
doubting which really was kingston

  me calmly inquired fate

   yes you  growled the chief

  guilty murmured fate as he finished
his champagne and arose

  they locked him up-and there was ex-
citement in traffic center

   it took a meeting of all traffic centers
bankers lawyers and business men to save
the town the huge lake national bank
in chicago rushed a man on a special train
with a million in cash

  but the mess was not so bad the hon
boyd hill kingston was a shrewd thinker

he wanted to do the best he could
for the boy

he saw his chance he promptly author-
ized all that fate johnson had done but
just what on the whole had he done who
was he no one knew and all hastened
to the jail mrs kingston went with them
out of curiosity

  they found fate asleep

  he rolled over on his iron cot sat up
and surveyed his callers sleepily

   whoever you are began kingston
youre a daisy youve raised cain
what did you do it for youve signed and
uttered enough forgeries to put yourself in
the  pen  till the sun cools tell us about
it wont you 

  talk  thundered the chief

   fate scratched his chin

  whereve you been he finally asked
me gasped kingston i was hurt
in a wreck in nebraska been in the hos-
pital with concussion of brain my wife
and i-er-our baby was burned there and
i thought my clothes and papers were
taint burned soliloquized fate re-
garding a crack in the floor

  taint burned shrieked
mrs kingston where is he

where is my baby 

  fate fished into his pocket-
the police had overlooked it
and the chief frowned - and
drew out a babys shoe of blue
leather

let me out - and stand for that orphan
asylum and ill tell were your kid is
yes-yes urged mrs kingston

   yes echoed kingston

    yes growled the chief

  yes echoed the lawyers

  write it said fate having had long
           experience

kingstoh hesitated at first
but on second thought he did so
with a fountain pen at the dic-
tation of the lawyers he hand-
ed the paper through the bars
fate took it read it and hand-
ed it to mrs kingston stand-
ing imploringly before him

yes you growled the chief

  this its shoe he asked

   yes-yes where is he - where is
he wailed the frantic woman kneeling
on the cement floor and reaching her arms
through the cell bars fate turned away his
head rose to his feet put his hands in his
pockets and made oration to kingston
you aint lost nothing nobody has
and you cant prove no evil motive you

  you keep it for me lady your baby

which yours truly founded

  that night a hobo mounted the blind-
baggage of the st louis express  fate

as he wondered how soon the brakeman
would come along and ask him to pay or
fade away

it is interesting to note the heat value of coal in
comparison with other fuels the variation
in coal samples however makes it impossible to
fix an exact standard the conclusions recently
arrived at by the united states geological survey
are based upon what is known as pure coal or

queer railroads i have known

by stephen chalmers

in the january number of the railroad mans magazine charles fred-
erick carter told about some antiquated steam roads on which he traveled
during a recent journey in europe but it seems that you dont have to
cross the atlantic to make a study of old-fashioned railroads south america
and the west indies are full of them roads that look as if they might have
been built before the flood are operated on the same principle as old horse-
car lines	

    mr chalmerss experiences in the rickety coaches of slow-moving trains
run by engineers who played checkers and pulled the  leber  ought to be
something to make calamity howlers knockers and railroad jokers who scorn
the excellent service they receive in this country sit up and take notice

trains on a certain central american railroad only forty-seven miles
long are frequently two hours late humorous
customs of jamaican trainmen

     the main good thing about this railway
  is that it saves you walking up a half-mile
  pier to the baked waterless iceless lizard-
  inhabited scattering of tin-roofed human
  furnaces that is mapped as savanilla alias
  puerto colombia the pier was built by
  the steamship companies which is too bad
  for one would have liked to credit the rail-
  way itself with one redeeming feature

making a start

     the train loads at the head of the pier
  it is made up of three or four obsolete com-
  partment-cars with wooden seats and stiff
  rusted squeaky windows that you may raise
  and bake or leave down and choke from
  soft-coal cinders-just as you see fit

     when the train starts up the pier al-

though the footboard is festooned with native

  for instance there is a railway which cargo-passers it is some consolation to
runs from savanilla colombia up to bar- feel that you are off but alas arrived
ranquilla and maybe to bogota i went at the dried-up town at the land-end of the
no farther than barranquilla for reasons pier it is as if you had just backed into the
which should be perfectly obvious	terminus in a newly made-up train



       n criticizing railways one can
          generally command a sympa-
          thetic audience the railway
          joke is as old as-railways it
          began with the first loud guf-
          faw when robert stephenson
          ran his  puffing billy

  in england the london and south-
western is the butt of the railway joke as
the erie is here i have traveled on both the
erie and the l  s w and i fail to see
anything seriously the matter witheither
of them in fact i make bold to state that
because of the joke that shadows the es-
cutcheon of these roads each is particularly
painstaking and courteous in its service

  there are some railways in this world
alongside which either the erie or the lon-
don and southwestern would look like the
kings snecial on coronation day


the railroad mans magazine

   one day i sat stewing in one of the crazy
wooden compartments waiting for that train
to start from savanilla for barranquilla
the depot was an oblong of cement paving
-quite warm in the tropics-shaded by a
red-painted galvanized-iron roof when
the sun beats on that roof and the iron be-
comes almost red-hot the shade it gives is
something like that suggested by dantes
inferno

  nevertheless there seemed to be some
people who actually enjoyed it i remember
there were several syrian pack-pedlers who
were too wise to climb aboard that train
before starting-time was announced they
sat on a bench under the galvanized-iron
roof and dozed away the happy hours of
waiting in company with other slumberers

  i have wondered since if by any chance
these people were not really overpowered
by the heat for when-at the end of time-
the conductor yelled out in spanish that all
was ready for the start he found it neces-
sary to awake them and ask if they were
planning to travel by his train

  even after everybody was aboard there
was some delay occasioned by the fact that
the stoker and the engineer were in the
middle of an interesting game of checkers
on the iron step of the locomotive this
may sound unconvincing but the reader
is assured by an eye-witness that it is not
even exaggerated

   when the train at last started it was as
if some prehistoric monster that has been
asleep for an eon of years awakes and
limbers up its stiff joints what snortings
creakings groanings hissings and nerve-
ripping flange shrieks came from that loco-
motive before it got under way

   the agonies of that ride up the valley
rumbling around uneven curves laboriously
toiling up steep grades and seeming to
tumble rather than roll down dips with
the sun blazing in at one window this minute
and glaring in at the other the next as the
train twisted are too painful for detailed
description in a world that is already full
of sorrow and discomfort

zigzagging up the grade

   of course one associates this sort of hu-
mor with all things latin-american while
admitting that this colombian railroad was
as much opera bouffe as anything i ever
read in a south american revolutionary
novel i must also admit that in south

america i found if not the best managed
road at least one that holds the palm for
scenic charm

  i have never been on the trans-andean
and the guayaquil to quito road was not
completed when i was in that region but
it would be hard to beat the magnificence
of the zigzag from la guayra to caracas
in venezuela

  when you come out of your ships cabin
in the dawn as i did once in la guayra
harbor and stare up at the mountains which
rise abruptly from the waters edge to a
height of between seven and ten thousand
feet it is difficult enough to conceive how
the town of la guayra manages to stick on
without being prepared to believe that a
railway goes up the face of that stupendous
mountain range

over the panama road

   yet it is the truth and it is also one of
the greatest engineering feats ever performed
in railway construction i am not pre-
pared to state what the rise per mile is on
this single track but supposing the height
to be climbed is six thousand feet at least
and it takes at least two hours to get away
with that six thousand feet you have some
idea of what the builders of that road had
to contend with

  starting from the depot at la guayra
the train runs along the shore for a couple
of miles to the west then the road and
the train begin to climb the face of the
mountain is so precipitous that the track is
one long zigzag all the time here one can
literally speak of the engine turning around
and meeting its own tail-end going in an
opposite direction

  as the zigzag eats up the heights a
panorama unravels itself that staggers de-
scription the mountain falls right from
the wheels of the train into the sea thousands
of feet below and ones scalp creeps over
the possibility of the train falling with it
the sea spreads like a blue cloth spotted
with little ships and tufts of green and
rocky headlands and the view grows as the
train climbs higher and higher

  when the shoulder of the mountain is
reached the locomotives herculean task is
done and presently the train rattles merrily
down into an amphitheater of hills in the
hollow of which lies caracas-the paris of
south america

most people will be interested in the pan-
queer railroads i have known



ama railroad which for years controlled
the isthmus-and the canal for that matter
-running a steamer service in conjunction
between san francisco and panama and
from the other terminus colon to new
york

  this bit of railroad is only forty-seven
niles long and it has a stop about every
three miles what with stops and starts
delays and shunting among dirt-trains etc
the passenger-train which is supposed to
make the forty-seven-mile trip in two hours
is sometimes two hours late

  ever since the american entered the zone
the panama railroad is getting quite smart
the stops are as numerous as ever there
is monkey hill and bohio and frijoles
beans and a host of others with pic-
turesque names the cars are as uncom-
fortable as ever and no doubt the atmos-
phere is as redolent of patchouli and pink
powder than which the half-spanish wom-
en love nothing better on special occasions-
like traveling on the panama railroad

comic elements of jamaica

  the road runs almost parallel with the
 ditch   and as compensation for many
discomforts one may catch an occasional
glimpse of the canal with uncle sams
steam-shovels biting up the dirt and spitting
it out again into trucks on a narrow-gage
road

  a sad aspect of travel on this road how-
ever is the sight all along the route of
abandoned locomotives derricks trucks
etc when the french company went to
smash and the famous panama scandal
raised its head the works were abandoned
as monuments for the scores of frenchmen
who were buried in yellow-fever graves

  one of the saddest sights i ever saw--
impressive in its suggestion of fallen power
-was a locomotive toppled over on its side
by the old canal rusted and twined with
weeds that blossomed out of its funnel
where i have no doubt the birds had built
nests year after year

  one would think that getting as near
the united states as the island of jamaica
one would fail to find any of the comic
elements of primitive railroads yet i do
not think i have ever had funnier railroad
experiences than in jamaica

  the jamaica railroad is a fine piece of
engineering it runs from kingston to
spanish town at the base of the interior

mountains where it branches off into two
arms one running diagonally across the
island to montengo bay in the northwest
of the island the other running similarly
to port antonio in the northeast corner

  from the port antonio branch there is
a little fork that rims to a place called
ewarton it goes no further for frowning
mount diablo is there to defy if not the
engineer who built the road at least the
poorly lined pocket of the jamaica govern-
ment

  the jamaica railway was first run by
an american company under lease from the
government no doubt the american com-
pany made money out of it and had no in-
tention of doing anything else certain it
is that the government was dissatisfied with
something and the lease was not renewed
it then became the jamaica government
railway and as such is no better than it
was under the american company

  the officials with the exception of a few
who are high in office are all negroes the
locomotive engineer is black beneath his
soot and the stoker need not burrow in the
coal to disguise his race the conductors
are negroes and their efforts to carry them-
selves with fitting dignity are sometimes
uproariously amusing to american tourists

   dis way foh de poht antony train be
pleased to move swiftly kind ladies de
train am about to staht 

  between two stations on the port antonio
line there are eleven tunnels through a very
mountainous region as at savanilla the
cars are mostly of the compartment wooden-
box order with windows that refuse to be
closed when it so happens that you do not
chose to leave them wide open

when sam pulled the  leber

  before entering the first of the eleven
tunnels you chose your own fate either to
be baked in an oven or asphyxiated with
soft-coal smoke and cinders most people
leave the windows open with the result diat
they gasp for breath as they come out of
one tunnel and before the air is cleared
of smoke they are choking in the sooty
blackness of another

  there are eleven tunnels in quick suc-
cession

  after the tribulations of the tunnels the
engineer likes to make some speed going
down hill one sunday afternoon the train
was late the driver opened the throttle


the railroad mans magazine

for twenty minutes that train fairly
streaked down a gorge and spun around
curves on two wheels as it seemed

  the conductor an amiable black with
two front teeth missing was walking along
the footboard collecting tickets the sway-
ing and rolling and lurching of the train
seemed to delight his play-loving soul as
he took my ticket his feelings overcame
him he emitted a whoop and yelled

   open de leber sam open de leber 
sam did i found myself holding on to
my seat wondering if again as once before
the train was to miss points bang into a
train-load of bananas and precipitate me
into the vest of a stout member of the ja-
maica legislature

  oddly enough this incident happened
near a grade where years before the coup-
lings broke between the cars of a heavily
laden train

  but the comedy of this railway exceeds its
tragedy i will never forget once during
the rainy season when having been penned
up in a house in the mountains i tried to
reach kingston allowing for a number
of washouts i made fairly good time as far
as spanish town where the trains of the
other two branches were hitched on behind
then the big train with the second-hand
dromedary engine started across the swamps
to kingston

  this swamp used to be a lagoon it
was a splendid place for ducks but an awful
place for a train during the wet season
out of the morass the sunken waters seemed
to have risen to meet their descending
brothers from the clouds gray patches of
water became more frequent among the green
patches of rank growth every now and

needed a s

i here is one thing about the new equip-
-i- ment of the western pacific says e l
lomax  and that is the windows of the cars
they can be opened by a child

   the difficulty in opening car windows re-
minds me of a story told by a theatrical manager
who was featuring an italian as  biancilla the
strong man from rome

   one day traveling from kansas city to
omaha in a day-coach the strong man and his
manager were seated just ahead of a tall man with
side whiskers the man with the side whiskers
evidently overheard the conversation between the
strong man and his manager for after a time he
tapped the italian on the shoulder saying

  then you could hear the swash of the waters
  breaking away from the wheels of the lum-
  bering train

    it grew dark and still the train jogged
  along at an alligators pace the windows
  were up and we couldsee nothing through
  the rain-spattered panes but an occasional
  dismal light inside the compartments it
  was reeking hot-reeking is the only word

   finally the train came to a standstill
 after a great swashing when it did not
 move again some of us let down the windows
 and looked out we couldnt see much
 but such as we did see was mist and an
 expanse of water all around it was as if
 a railway train had run on a reef in mid-
 ocean and we had no hope of anything but
 a stray sail or a desert island

   we were stuck there for hours from
 the knee-deep footboard the conductor ex-
 pressed his opinion of the engineer and the
 engineer from his swamped locomotive re-
 torted that he at least had  never been in
 the  porpus-house  - which i afterward
 translated into pauper-house or poor-
 house

    just what that had to do with a railway
  train run aground in the middle of a lagoon
  i never found out

    another pleasant incident of almost ap-
  palling frequency on this road is the sudden
  stop of the train when it is mustering full
  speed then there will come a crash and a
  jolt and the indignant voice of the black
  engineer will be heard shouting

    dat is de foolisliest mule i ever see i
  wouldnt own sich a mule to me name

    neither would the owner save on paper
  when he receives twice as much as the mule
  is worth from the jamaica railway

trong man

      excuse me sir but are you not biancilla
  the strong man  

      biancilla admitted the soft impeachment

      is it true that you can lift two and a half
  tons in harness

       yes

     you can hold two men at arms length with-
  out difficulty

       i can

      and put up five hundred pounds with one
  arm 

       yes

      then concluded the man with the side
  whiskers  would you kindly raise this car-win-

            a chase over the wild western
            prairies and an unexpected meeting

chapter xviii
after the escape

ith daylight the wind
  hushed the sand settled
  morning brought the
  fresh peace of eden
  over the desert

   flying toward the
light a sweating panting man with swol-
len splitting lips and tongue and purplish
face with dried blood staining his skin
matted in his hair and stiffening his
clothes loped across the sands his gait
was weary but never changing

  miles away was a water-hole this
was his goal in it was the only water to
be had in this direction within fifty-four
miles of the scene of his last nights crime

  aided by the natural running powers
of his zulu-indian blood salarado kept
steadily desperately on his way to stop
meant to stiffen to run no more to die

  miles behind him but on tough tireless
mustangs and carrying water with them
came the living seven of the jury led by
the raging father of star eves one of the
seven had a livid mark around his neck
where the knot had cut into the skin the
place was raw his neck was stiff his
throat was sore his head roared but he
rode like a centaur

  he had been cut down just in time the
jailer dead the sheriff dead their five
comrades dead the seven alone remained
they were terrible in their avenging anger

  to reach the water-hole first was to
capture or to kill salarado nowhere else
was there for the hunted man to go for no-
where else was there water

began in the december  railroad

     once let the seven get to the water-hole
  before salarado and the chase was ended
  then their quarry must either come stag-
  gering into their hands or dry and die in-
  sane with thirst on the desert

    hence salarado ran and the seven rode
  racing for the water-hole

    the sun rose a yellow flood of light
  cut by great streams of shadows burst
  across the plains to the west

     salarado reached a small hill that over-
  looked the water-hole at its base and his
  back-trail for miles revenge and justice
  were thundering along his track not far be-
  hind and salarado knew it

    he paused on the tip of the knoll and
  looked back a faint cloud of dust floated
  into the air ten miles away seven black
  dots for an instant bobbed against the sky
  it was the coming jury the ponies were
  tired it would be a full hour before the
  horseman could reach the water-hole

     for a few miles a ridden horse can out-
  run a man fifty miles makes the chances
  very nearly equal for one hundred miles
  and over the human runner if lie be a
  racer among his kind and has a few hours
  start has little to fear from any pursuit
  that travels on unsplit hoofs

    the reindeer and the moose have divi-
  ded feet an indian runner will catch a
  deer in one day a horse in five any liv-
  ing creature in thirty man has will-
  power which drives him ever onward lie
  wastes not a unit of his strength the
  animal has only brute force and lacks the
  intellect with which to husband and to di-
  rect his powers to the best advantage

    all this salarado knew but he was
  handicapped by clothing food and weap-
  ons the pounding of the six-shooter on

mant magazine single copies  eenti




the railroad mans magazine

his hip annoyed him if he had been un-
encumbered and in his full strength the
chase would have been sport as it was
the issue was doubtful

  when force leaves the muscles cunning
enters the mind an hour contains sixty
minutes a minute contains sixty seconds
the law of gravitation was guessed in a
second salarado had an hour

  to give his surging blood -a chance to
cool salarado walked down the hill to
the tempting water he found the water-
hole only a yard across and a foot deep
it was crusted with alkali-yet it was
water

  moral restraint salarado knew not but
physically his self-control was almost per-
fect he knelt at the edge of the water
and plunged his head into the cool liquid
to his shoulders his mouth and eyes were
open the water soaked into the dusty
cavities of his head but he drank not a
drop

  when his breath was exhausted salarado
raised his head the breeze of the early
morning and the water cooled his fevered
blood and soothed his throbbing temples

  nature is above the petty quarrels of
humans

  then slowly and with a physical delight
that those crowded in civilization cannot
even dream of salarado slowly sipped a
pint of water

  knowing that he would stiffen if he re-
mained motionless except for a few mo-
ments salarado began to walk in a cir-
cle around the water-hole he was hun-
gry a fifty-four mile run is a wonderful
appetizer

  he slowly ate the food chewing it thor-
oughly that the murdered jailer had
brought to his cell the evening before he
had carried it all those parched weary
miles behind him when where and how he
would get more he knew not his tongue
and lips were split and bleeding his
own blood from the smarting cracks min-
gled with his food but salarado did not
notice it

  his eyes roved warily to the hill-top
where he had recently stood the blood
throbbing in his ears made him restless and
uneasy it sounded like hoofs rapidly
pounding the prairie sod

  from almost beneath his feet a jack-
rabbit sprang up and awkwardly limped
away with swaying ears crack a bul-
let from salarados six-shooter left the

rabbits head hanging only by a bit of
skin salarado eagerly picked up the kick-
ing body and carried it to the water-hole
using the keen-edged clasp-knife he had
taken from the jailers body salarado
quickly peeled the skin from the rabbit
but without cutting or tearing it except
at the feet and tail he turned the skin
flesh-side out and rapidly but carefully
cleaned it by means of the knife and
water with a few pieces of silk thread
from his neck-scarf-the same to which
he so largely owed his escape-he tightly
tied all the openings in the skin he turned
the skin fur-side out he dipped it into
the water and brought it up full

  when salarado had tied the neck-open-
ing the improvised skin water-bottle held
almost a gallon of the life renewing fluid
the taste would be bad yet it would be
water-water ever delicious to a dusty
throat

  all this was done without any loss of
time the jurymen were coming salara-
do did not forget that yet water he must
have or die it was seventy-six miles to
the next water-hole

  salarado tok another drink this time
more than before but he sipped it as slow-
ly as he did the first with all his cloth-
ing on salarado crawled into the water
for a momentary bath it was a danger-
ous thing to do but refreshment and stimu-
lant he must have

  the jurymen had found his whisky-
bottle empty and broken twenty miles
back salarado had stumbled and fallen
in the darkness breaking the bottle and
spilling the liquor

  when salarado rose soaked and drip-
ping the water in the spring was pink
the diluted blood of seven men and one
woman tinted it as his muscles were
stiffening a little and beginning to ache
he resumed his circle walking glanced
about then at the hill-top the seven
were nearer

  twenty feet away a dead horse sala-
rado holding his breath laboriously
hitched this mass first by the forefeet then
by the hind to the edge of the water-hole

  once more salarado drank of the water
discolored as it was the desert and priva-
tion take the daintiness out of a man
this time salarado drank his fill he
gulped the water down those horsemen
were coming

  then he plunged the carcass into the
mason the grizzly



water-hole the dead animal more than
filled it he thrust his knife into the dead
animals body in a few moments the water
was unfit to drink

  salarado grabbed up the dressed rabbit
and his water-bottle and precipitously fled
up the wind halting a moment he cut
the rabbit into several strips and fastened
them to his cartridge-belt meat treated
in this way does not spoil in new mexico
it dries and cures even-without salt in
the dry germless air of the desert

  here was food and-what was of most
vital importance-drink for salarado un-
til he could reach the next water-hole
seventy-six miles away over a blistering
waste of sand

  the horsemen-now only a mile away-
must here turn back they would soon
arrive parched-both men and horses-
by their all-night chase through a sand-
storm they would find instead of cool
water an undrinkable mess chagrin that
sickens the heart would be theirs

  salarado was pleased yet how he
longed for a handful of arsenic this
metallic murder dissolves in water and
leaves it tasteless odorless colorless and
apparently harmless with a little of this
malicious metal salarado would have poi-
soned his hunters like wolves but re-
grets were useless salarado had no ar-
senic kill the coming jurymen as he had
their fellows he could not he could only
turn them back

  if salarado had left the water-hole un-
defiled there his pursuers would have
camped then when well rested they
would have pushed on and overtaken him
-unavoidably handicapped as he was with
meat water and revolver

  as it was however having cut his trail-
ers off from all water it meant that they
must here take the back-track at once and
ride the thirsty ponies until one by one
they dropped then humanely shoot them
and push ahead on foot until the settle-
-ment was reached or dead men as well as
dead horses would disfigure the retreat
for the jurymen-when they came to the
water-hole-to attempt to go on after sala-
rado without rest or water would have been
sure suicide

  by defiling the water-hole salarado had
saved his life it made his escape now
sure and easy by doing so however he
had committed another capital offense
worse than murder even worse than horse

stealing to defile a water-hole or-find-
ing one so-to leave it polluted was a deed
that meant death by rope or bullet

   so ruled the terrible unwritten yet just
law of the frontier in those days on the
desert such a deed might mean a linger-
ing death to a whole wagon-train but
what cared salarado

   to freedom and safety salarado sneaked
up a gulch and out of sight just as the
seven burst over the edge of the hill and
thundered down to the water-hole-and to
soul-strangling disappointment

chapter xix

judgment by the water-hole

o	alarado was free he knew it
 they knew it although still tired
he was refreshed food and drink though
limited he still had seventy-six miles to
the next water-hole was nothing for a run-
ner like salarado there he could kill a
rabbit a prairie-dog a coyote or perhaps
an antelope for more food

   a quick eye is the mother of luck-hence
salarado was always lucky telegraph-
wires were unknown in new mexico in
those days he would be traveling ahead
of the news he had nothing to fear either
ahead or behind two more days and he
would be safe in no mans land the haven
of all such as he over the next ridge front
the water-hole he would sleep protected
from the sun under the overhanging bank
of some dried-up watercourse during the
frying heat of the day

  then through the cool evening and the
cold night he would easily cover those sev-
enty-odd miles at a steady walk up-hill and
on the level and at a sliding trot down
grade to rest him by changing gait

   for the first time in his life under these
easy circumstances salarado was not happy
a sickening reaction in body mind and
soul ras beginning to come over this here-
tofore pitiless man

  what was the use-the end of it all
what would he not give for rest and peace
for death 

  he stopped should he turn back and
defy those seven men they would kill
him good but then it would seem as if
he - salarado - had been unable to get
away as if he had been run down and shot
like a coyote by men mentally and bodily
his inferiors


the railroad mans magazine

  no salarado would go on

  such were the half - formed ideas that
were beginning to rise like mist from the
soul within the mind of this desperado
who when frenzied would wantonly attack
anything mixing race - bloods produces
strange results mentally a hybrid morally
a deformity physically a marvelous ma-
chine long dormant qualities inherited
from his white fathers were beginning to
whisper to salarado

  rounding a sharp turn in the bed of the
watercourse this soul-frightened man saw
a dying horse lying before him thirst was
killing it from the slightly heaving form
a buzzard rose and slowly flapped up the
ravine a magpie stopped pecking at the
horses eyes and refusing to leave dipped
and tettered scolding noisily at the human
intruder

  within the shadow cast by the eastern
bank a few feet from the dying animal sat
a girl a vision in gold and white-star
eyes -

  salarado quailed he knew her for
the first time the eyes of the animal met the
eyes of the angel the fiend was con-
quered superstitious fear the self-
loathing of a conscience-awakened soul the
bewildering dazzling recognition of a here-
tofore unknown and undreamed of spiritual
affinity and other causes that the human
mind and soul can only grope for but can-
not grasp brought salarado - mentally
morally and in body prostrate-crying and
pleading for he knew not what at the feet
of the star-eyed

  on the girl the effect of the meeting was
even greater than on salarado exhaust-
ed by her insane wanderings on horseback
over the desert during the storm the here-
tofore unknown strain had brought the girl
to a point where great changes physical
and mental sometimes occur in those with
a mind diseased

  it meant shortly either mental life or
physical death something in the power-
ful physical intensity of salarado per-
vaded and overwhelmed the lost girl ex-
hausted as she was almost to the point of
conscious dissolution it put her body into
harmony with the perfect mechanism of
salarados tigerlike physique

  the atmosphere of his presence the re-
vived hope it gave her stimulated her
thrilled her into new life having for the
first time been dependent on herself-and
in terrible danger too-and knowing phys-

ical suffering for the first time the break-
ing strain of desperately attempted logical
thought all had left the clouded mind of
star eyes in a semi-cleared but almost fa-
tally paralyzed state

  the shock of seeing a bloody disheveled
wild-eyed giant bound suddenly around the
bend-bursting upon her like a devil-stop
and fall moaning and shrinking at her
feet caused a blinding deafening flash to
crash like lightning through the mind of
star eyes then instantly all was as clear
within as the crystal air without

  salarado had brought to her reason as
well as life

  the instantaneous inexplicable dovetail-
ing of these two souls put each in tune with
the other with the world and with heaven
he unkeyed the mental strain in her she
tightened the moral in him the conversion
of a soul the awakening of reason in a
chaotic mind are things that cannot be ex-
plained by man great minds even those
skilled in the science of the physician can
only see and wonder thepetty ones sneer

  the mutual recognition of the soul affin-
ity between star eyes and salarado was
instantaneous after the first bewildering
instant she rose to her feet no longer a be-
ing verging on the idiot but a pure-hearted
clear-minded woman though swaying on
the edge of death

  at her feet clasping her knees with
mighty blood-stained arms cringed a self-
haunted man praying beseeching in ab-
ject terror and repentance for forgiveness
and spiritual help

  for the first time the soul of salarado
realized its position before god and man
a moment before it had been salarado ths
buffalo against the world now it was
salarado the convert for the good of man

  star eyes dropped a white hand onto
the wet black bloody hair of the cowering
salarado reeled clutched at the air for
help and staggered

  her shriveled throat and lips could speak
no word salarado leaped to his feet
caught the fainting girl and gently laid her
down on the sands still cool in the shadow
of the bank

  from the rabbit - skin water-bottle he
poured a tiny stream of water down her
throat unable to speak but revived-
though only a little-she silently thanked
her heretofore savage rescuer with those
great deep blue-black starlike eyes now
they were lit with the light of reason
mason the grizzly



salarado thought of mexie - and shud-
dered

  like a sleepy child star eyes resigned
herself to salarado he picked her up as
he would a wounded seraph with her in
his arms salarado climbed the steep bank
of the watercourse and stepped out onto the
open prairie

  the cursing horsemen galloped to the
hopelessly polluted water - hole and had
turned back in sullen silence virulently
cursing salarado they waited only long
enough to pull-by means of hurled rope
and saddle - horn - the carcass from the
spring bail it out they could not

  on their return to the settlement a party
would be sent at once properly provisioned
and equipped to do that most important
thing of desert-land

  the seven rode wearily to the top of the
hill where salarado had stood only an hour
before shame-stung they drew rein and
for the last time scanned the deserted plains

  clear and crackling through the fresh
morning air rang six shots from a distant
six-shooter far away the hawk-like eyes
of those trained plainsmen recognized sala-
rado with a long white drooping object
in his arms he was running toward them

  fourteen reddened spurs cut into four-
teen shrunken flanks seven men with
drawn six-shooters and poised rifles yell-
ing hoarsely in grisly triumph charged
down on the approaching desperado

  salarado with star eyes in his arms and
the seven vengeful jurymen met in silence
at the water-hole with the seven anger
was lost in amazement they were as-
tounded salarado was unarmed his
six-shooter his only weapon he had cast
from him after it had served in the first
good cause it had ever known

   salarado let star eyes slip to the ground
where she stood leaning against his shoul-
der and supported by his arm

  a wondrous sight those two made the
center of a wondrous picture above-the
clear blue heaven flecked with faint wreaths
of last nights storm over all the awful si-
lence and majesty of the desert on seven
wreaking exhausted ponies seven men sat
dumb and motionless above a black dot
in the crystal blue hung the buzzard a
bunch of thirsty curious stamping ante-
lope crowned a distant knoll a coyote fol-
lowed by her cubs sniffed uneasily along
the fresh trail the morning wind breathed
among die curled buffalo grass

  star eyes broke the silence to her
father she spoke the swollen lips would
give forth only husky whispers

  salarado gave her water the jurymen
looked on hungrily the horses scented it
and pawed the dry sand to the worn-out
animals another hour without water meanf
death

  with clearing voice star eyes told her
story told how she had in her delirium
stolen from her bed and saddling a horse
had wandered awav before the storm why
or where she knew not how salarado found
her the change in him the change in her

  she told with scarlet features but defiant
eyes of her new-found but eternity-old
love for him and of his for her she spoke
of how in a way unknown-dimly realized
by them but not by the rest-how salarado
had given her the blessing of reason how
she had cleansed his soul how the old sal-
arado was dead how they would never find
the man they sought although his body
was before them now

  she reminded these men of their love
their almost holy devotion to her-as pure
women are worshiped nowhere else but on
the frontier-of her unselfish kindness and
love to them and theirs a thousand times
expressed in acts when they or their dear
ones were sick or in trouble in former years

  she called upon each man in turn per-
sonally and by name to remember what
she had done for him how she nursed this
one back to life from a bed of sickness
bound that ones wounds how she had
soothed and brought comfort to another
and to those he loved how her own hands
had prepared their dead for the grave

  she pleaded she demanded that her
father the most powerful man in new
mexico should keep his oath-they all had
been witnesses to it many times-that he
would give his all and himself that she
star eyes his daughter-her mother and
his deactwife again living in her likeness-
might have reason come by whom or how
it may

  salarado had given her reason-salarado
had given her life even now but for this
man she would be lying helpless in yonder
gulch

  all this the girl laid before the jury at
the water-hole in the desert

  he could have escaped she continued
and she showed them how salarado of-
fered himself that she might live-live now
in the light of reason salarado was a


the railroad mans magazine

changed man hereafter he would live only
to do good to do right to correct as far as
it was in his power the wrongs he had
done

  she asked that the life and liberty of her
savior-salarado her lover-might be hers
almost inspired by her new-born love-
which satisfied her heretofore life - lopg
heart - hunger - the girl leaned wearily
against her lovers broad shoulder and
pleaded his cause

  star eyes stopped silence came again
like a living statue salarado towered si-
lent and without motion

  for a second time the jurymen debated
upon the life of salarado this time with-
out a word each man within himself
what star eyes had said was true sala-
rado had been safe and free for her
sake for their sake through her he was
once more their prisoner and of his own
free will the chivalry of it all the
knighthood of the frontier appealed to
those silent men

  yet fifty-four miles away were ten dead
bodies-and one moaning woman with
empty eye-sockets true some deserved
their fate-yet the others had been inno-
cent six had been murdered most brutal-
ly even tortured before their very eyes

  they too had been bound by this very
salarado before them and but for a rare
accident they too would even now be ly-
ing cold stiff and bloody side by side
with their five fellow jurymen

  perhaps it was a trick yet no free-
dom and life had been sure to salarado
this man was not the salarado they had
known the salarado of old would have
killed star eyes this man-their once
condemned prisoner-had proven himself
to be first a demon then a man should
they now legally murder the living man be-
cause of the dead demon of moral insanity
he had annihilated within himself or
should they-

  suddenly the juryman with the raw
swollen neck snapped his teeth whipped
out his six-shooter and fired at the breast
of salarado instantly catching the move-
ment and knowing what was coming star
eyes like a flash stepped in front of sala-
rado and faced the weapon with her arms
thrown bafck

  the revolver belched death the bullet
pierced the brain of the girl and buried it-
self in the heart of salarado star eyes
whirled her soft white arms convulsive-

ly encircled the swarthy neck of salarado
his great dusky arms crushed the girl to
his brown and bleeding breast

  the old savage light for an instant
gleamed in salarados eyes then it died
out and into them came a look of unutter-
able pity forgiveness and calm heavenly
thankfulness like a tree salarado fell
star eyes in his arms

  a sigh of guilty relief came from the
hearts of the others all except that of the
dead girls father his maddened six-
shooter instantly rattled five bullets through
the murderer of his idol and salarado

  from the saddle the body flopped to the
sands its unmounted horse snuffed at it
snorted and backed away stepping out
of his saddle his smoking weapon still in
his hand-and flinging aside his sombrero
-the father knelt beside the dead bodies

  the fair sweet lips-bruised with
pleading-parted in the smile of a cherub
he kissed with his hand reverently on
the forehead of the dead salarado whose
face was like that of a bronze god the
gray-haired man lifted his face and open
eyes to the clear heavens he prayed not
audibly-for the lips know not words to
fit emotions that stir the soul in its depths
-but he breathed in almost silent moans

  kneeling thus with one quick motion the
stricken man fired the last shot into his
own forehead

  on the hill above the water-hole they
buried them where they died the body of
him who shot the lovers lay in a shallow
grave-on which the cactus refused to live
-till the coyotes dug it up and gnawed the
bones in another grave is the body of the
father the blackened empty six-shooter
still clenched in his hand

  in the third grave deeper and broader
than the others-now marked with a stone
cross on which is rudely cut the letter  s
and the legend pax v obis cum - they laid
two bodies wound in each others arms
one small slender and fair as was star
eyes the other great dark and powerful
that of the bad man the fiend the des-
perado the buffalo-salarado

chapter xx
an answer to the stars

tust at dark a month later a man rode
 into the camp of a white man and an
indian at the foot of pikes peak by die
mason the grizzly



camp vvas-a flow of mineral water now fa-
mous as manitou springs by the camp-
fire the indian was crouched in his blan-
ket silent as wood standing before the
flames his hands deep in his canvas
trousers pockets was a hale portly old fel-
low-the white man

  suddenly he turned and looked into the
circling dusk the indian moved his eyes
and twitched his nostrils then relapsed into
his apparent stupor the sound of a walk-
ing horse came nearer and nearer then the
horseman drew rein before the fire

   good evening pard- by all the gods
and little fishes if it aint mason why
man youve been dead for ten years-
ben holliday well well well-got
any supper dead men dont eat-
how to the indian

   ugh heap good grunted the ute
without moving yet his eyes studied
mason keenly

  supper was done-supper of deer meat
beans bread and coffee then the pipes
long they talked holliday asked

  where have you been weve not
heard of you in years lets see the last
time i saw you was in denver-remember
the little lady you were starting for old
mexico were you not

   yes mused mason and holliday
wondered to which of his questions the an-
swer was given or if it applied to both
he smiled broadly to himself and chuckled
silently in the darkness mason filled his
pipe once more rubbed his heated smoking
shins and began

  yes i went to old mexico-still no-
sing after montezumas forgotten prospects
no luck of any kind for ten years then
i stopped at a sheep ranch on the desert in
new mexico and met-er- from that
i turned cowboy for two years texas in-
dian territory lost all i had over a bluff
in a northerner

  tried mail-carrying over berthoud
pass-no good near being hung in hot
sulphur where our old friend texas char-
lie-whatever became of  weasel by the
way shot thought so- well tex
died of lead poisoning there then not
long ago i was again in new mexico in
the  tear of the clouds  country came
from there here on my way back to den-
ver want to see what the old camp looks
like-

  ever hear of salarado down there
asked holliday

   mason eyed his old friend in silence

  why he asked

  then holliday told to mason the end
of salarado it was news to him ru-
mor can outtravel a bronco after a long
long silence - broken only by the indian
throwing new wood on the fire-mason
for the first time in his life told of the
affair on berthoud pass when mason
had done holliday said not a word but-
the night being clear - drew his buffalo
robe about him and lay down by the fire
finally he asked

    mason if on the spire that day you
could have foreseen the results of freeing
salarado-what would you have done

  long holliday waited for his answer
but the man gazing into the fire seemed
not to have heard him in an hour both
holliday and the indian were asleep
mason raised his head wearily and with
hungry eyes looked far up among the stars
then as if in answer to a question he said
 slowly

  what would you have done

       chapter xxi
       an indian legend

t ith the sun next morning the night
 vanished from the plains and moun-
tains and from the speech and actions of
the two white men and the indian-but not
from masons heart

   hollidays time had almost come years
of frontier exposure had gnawed at that
hardy constitution and now his days were
numbered he had come to the healing
iron-springs to find relief if not cure
stronger now he was off that morning for
a week on a cattle-buving trip to the south
the railroads had come long ago and had
ruined his coach-line his parting words
to mason as he shook hands from the sad-
dle were

  when you go to denver go and see my
lawyer judge france

   then with a cabalistic laugh he galloped
away as his old friend went down the
rocky trail mason saw coming up a ragged
pack-jack followed-by n man on foot evi-
dently he was too poor to own a horse on
the pack-animal was a prospectors outfit
none too good

   he halted at the iron-springs for a drink
and a momentary rest to masons quietly
cordial questions he made little reply but


the railroad mans magazine

admitted that he would cross the peak as
lie was bound for the other side-the side
to the west then he moved on this man
was bob womack ten years later he was
to give cripple creek to the world

  all that day mason lay in the warm
autumn sunshine and thought of his past
life here he was now a man of thirty-
five knocked by the world ever climbing
up only to slip back he could not see
where he had been at fault yet something
within himself told him that the fault was
all his own all day he was as silent as the
indian now and then each drank from
the iron-springs as the sun set mason
watched in the east for the evening star
when it beamed at him he said impatiently
-perhaps to it perhaps to himself per-
haps to the indian

   i am a dziggetai

   si senor grinned the indian

   that is chinese for  a wild ass what
does a ute buck know of chinese

    it is indian senor persisted the ute
    chinese

   indian

   mongolian

  ugh

  they were both right there is a kin-
ship between the mongolian and the indian
in tongue perhaps in blood

it was now dark in the deep ravine by
the iron springs but the summit of pikes
peak still was warm with the departing
light the indian pointed to it and said
 manitou make sign heap good
how

  then there in the gathering night by the
camp-fire mason listened first idly then
dreamily then fascinated to a legend old
as indian speech it fascinated because in
it-all unknown to him then-was the key
to the lost mines of montezuma acting
ten years later on what he heard by the
camp-fire that night mason was to become
a power throughout the west

  looking long at the peak then saluting
the iron spring gurgling away in the dark-
ness the indian said in spanish

  mason i know you iron hand was
with colorow when the quick young white
man was caught and got away good
heap good and to his white brother now
iron hand will tell what white ears have
never heard before it is of this peak this
iron spring the ascension of the manitou
and his gold lost beyond to the west
listen white brother

   an indian stood upon the crest of the
snowy range stone -snow and silence
were around him nothing else it was the
manitou the great spirit looked from
the eternal snows out over the plains and
mountains the heart of the manitou was
heavy

   clouds of dust floated like a thunder-
storm along the shimmering horizon far to-
ward the rising sun the prairies were
black with buffalo through the wild herds
darted fleet clouds of coursing antelope a
herd of wild horses swept along with the
easy swiftness of swallows the mountain-
forests were crowded with deer and wapiti
trout flashed their spotted sides in the sun-
light from a thousand streams and lakes
the great bear was lord of all acknowledg-
ing only man as master

   in the zenith shone the sun never mov-
ing never dimmed all was good and fair
to the eye over the plains and among the
mountains of the land which the palefaces
some ages hence were to call colorado the
heart of die manitou was heavy

   all this had he made for his children
the red riders of the plains and mighty
hunters of the mountains but the prairie-
riders slew dieir brothers of the mountains
and the mountaineers crept by night into
the sleeping-camps of the plainsmen slew
them in the tepees and stole their women
and their ponies the heart of the manitou
was heavy

   blood of his warring children stained
his works good and fair ungrateful they
had disobeyed him

   in sorrow the great spirit gazed over
the prairies and the peaks-and into the
open sky here was peace here would
he go

   he gave the word the voice of the
manitou echoed through the canons a
mist arose and hid the earth-but the sun-
light played upon the summits with his
tomahawk the manitou hewed out the rock
and made an altar such as men and gods
never had seen before this altar the pale-
faces were some day to call pikes peak
it was his altar of ascension he would
leave the world to the warring brothers but
his gold he would take with him the altar
rose among the mountains higher greater
than them all at length it was completed
a mande of snowy down crusted with glis-
tening jewels softly fell from heaven upon
it the manitou stood upon the summit
the heart of the manitou was heavy
mason the grizzly



  far to the north loomed two great piles
some day these were to be called by a
harsh tongue long and gray hidden there
was gold and silver colorado contained
more than the manitou could carry

   in the purple distance toward the warm
south-land shone the twin mounds to be
known as the spanish peaks beautiful
they were in their snowy purity but base
beneath their virgin whiteness was nothing
precious only cold stone they lured
they lied

  by a growing chasm they stand divided
even unto thisday and forever until their
atoms shall dissolve in eternity but greater
than these three was the altar beneath the
foot of the manitou the heart of the mani-
tou was heavy

    the birds the animals the reptiles and
the red children of the manitou war now
forgotten gathered round its base they
filled the earth as far as eye could see the
world was black with life all was silence
a belated wild duckcame whistling through
the air and sank into the multitude

  living creatures were without motion
the wind died the waters hung limpid
in the steep gulches leaves and grasses
withered  darkness fell through the
stagnant blackness rose on perfumed wings
the spirits of die dead flowers and kissed
the feet of their creator above all arched
the dome of heaven hung high with multi-
tudinous clouds of a thousand tints wreathed
to welcome the coming manitou the air
froze the heart of the manitou was heavy

  the manitou the great spirit the god
of nature and of natures children was leav-
ing them leaving them alone with sorrow
the manitou had hidden the earth beneath
a black shroud and had turned to the light
above as the black clouds hid his form
forever a great cry went up the winds
shrieked mountains torrents roaring with
anguish tore loose huge rocks arid hurled
them down upon the plains

  quivering to their hearts the moun-
tains split into fragments the earth ripped
ragged gashes across its face with fla-
ming swords the lightning slashed the sky
the crash of the tumbling thunder silenced
all ears nature lacerated herself in re-
pentant grief

   the cry pierced the black clouds out-
echoed the thunder and reached the ear
of the ascending manitou the lowering
blackness writhed a hesitating instant then
floated high above the earth changed to

   	rr

white and dissolving disappeared forever
never more will its shadow rest upon the
plains and mountains of colorado

  sunlight warm with life flooded the
earth all nature sighed in sorrow but with
relief-forgiven on  a chariot of rolling
vapor dazzling white drawn by the winds
rode the great spirit to the land of the
setting sun in the west hung a ball of
fire lighting with blinding splendor the
pathway of the manitou

    in pity tlie manitou dropped a tear for
his repentant children it fell at the foot
of his eternal altar to the east here this
healing spring has flowed for ages for red
men arid for white for black for yellow
and for brown all children of the manitou
to this day do these waters bear his name
this was his parting gift to the indians of
the prairies

  as the manitou rolled high oer the
mountain summits on his level path of sun-
beams straight to the west as an arrow
flies for his mountain children he dropped
all his golden treasures these fell at the
foot of his altar to the west this treasure
the white man will some day call  wounded
waters

   each day just at sunset the mantle of
the manitou floats over his altar and re-
flects the treasure at its foot as if the gold
were molten in a volcanic caldron far be-
low then through the night from the
mantle falls the dew giving eternal life to
the altar spring

   the gifts of the manitou are equal
they live forever so long as the spring
does flow so long will the gold be found
botli for man neither can be exhausted

   the shadows are the children of the
night every day at the hour of the as-
cension at the setting of the sun like wild
animals shadows creep out of the ravines
and form the dark secluded lairs of the
rocks and woods they slink across the
plains and prowl with silent movements
up the mountain sides to - the summits
here with the twilight they watch the day
kiss the world good night

   the quivering sunlight lavishes one
burning touch on the tip of the altar of the
manitou lingers a belated instant and is
gone evening rises from the east and
spreads chilled darkness oer the earth
with evening comes her sisters starlight
and moonlight shedding the promise of
light that his children may know that the
manitou watches while they sleep


the railroad mans magazine

  then the shadows and the moonbeams
play together beneath the nodding trees
the spirit of the manitou pervades his
voice is heard -in the rustling of the night
wind as it creeps among the grasses in
the snapping brushwood in the trinkling
of the tiny waterfall throwing diamonds to
the moonlight and in the muffled rolling
of the river

  his sighs sweep throughthe forest and
into the distant night thus is the ascen-
sion of the manitou his altar his healing
spring and his hidden gold kept ever fresh
in the hearts of his red children

  the animal in the heart of the red
hunter was lulled to sleep a soul awoke
the poetry in the savage heart unseen by
day shows as a point of light by night
no oozy pool is so small or foul but that
when calm it reflects a star

  this was the legend the indian told to
mason by camp-fire as they lay beneath
the whispering pines far into the night
the two lay watching the stars rise in the
east pass through the heavens and go out
of sight beyond the peak one was dream-
ing of the past the other of the future

  at the foot of james peak was the greg-
ory lode at the foot of grays peak was
silver georgetown at the foot of pikes

  for the rest of the night he slept where

  before sunrise next morning-a stranger
in a strange place that in his mind he
had long called  home -mason wan-
dered through the crowded nervous streets
down to the now walled-in bank of cherry

  he could only vaguely guess at the spot
where fifteen years before his bookstore
had stood on all sides were buildings
the waste of sand along the creek had
been changed into city lots nowhere was
there a trace of the flood of

you  

   dont know it was trying to locate
my old stamping ground where i once sold
books and dealt in gold dust-if you re-
member-

  remember mason no man would
ever forget you-

   by the way broke in mason to dodge
the compliment  who owns all this land
about here  

   you do

  me get out im too near broke to
rob my bronco of- oats with which to buy
a hotel bed so its rather a ragged joke
-comprendo 

   im not joking mason this land is
yours for the past ten years no one has
heard of you many thought you dead
some tried to jump your claim but hol-
liday paid the taxes and leased it in your
name when it became valuable-and the
court took caie of the rest-at my sugges-
tion now and then- the lawyer added
modestly

  mason closed his mouth and picked up
his pipe from the dust

   but how came i to own it he finally
managed to ask

   remember how you gave back that
bookstore to the pretty widow-after the
books went down cherry creek at that
remember the deed she gave you-infor-
mal but good as gold holliday was a wit-
ness you remember

   y-e-s murmured mason vaguely
lets see id forgotten all about that for
years-

   but holliday hadnt you see he put
the deed on record and its good to-dav
but-

  but what

    shes fighting it

  who-
  the widow

  well its hers isnt it still-

  not by a long shot mason it was
not worth fort- cents and a dead dog when
mason the grizzly



she pave it to you in return for that twelve
hundred dollars in gold-dust for the books
but shes a stunner though  still in her
twenties she claims-but i doubt it al-
though she looks like eighteen yet ill
admit-and still a widow

   she came to denver and began suit
about a year ago but ive managed to de-
lay things with no trouble besides shes
short of money but sos holliday for
that matter and the lands tied up-or
rather was-and you dead or alive no one
knew now you have a clear case well
push it to a close when court opens next
month

  whats all this land worth asked
mason in a daze

  something over a million

  a stare was the only answer the smiling
judge received

   me a million 

  a million-and over

   judge leave me now please i wani
to think but first show me where my
old book-stall was over there thanks
judge thank you ill lie down to your
office-where is it larimer corner of
fifteenth good-ill be down there pret-
ty soon	
 to lunch

   si i want to count all my grains of
sand-i mean gold-first

  so the lawyer left him mason wan-
dered over the pile of tin cans that marked
the site of his last store here he filled
his pipe-and gazed at the city about him
at the ground beneath his feet at the sky
smiling over head

  mason thought it a perfect morning
he was as poor as ever-so he seemed to
himself-all this belonged to others to
any one but himself but the sky the air
and the morning was still his unable to
realize it allv he arose and said aloud
take all things with a sense of humor
and a knowledge of astronomy

  just then the sun rose mason looked
straight into its glory and laughed out-
right

  at noon a man walked into judge
frances office he carried himself with a
fresh dignity a new importance the
following conversation took place

    judge youd better drop that case dont
you think

  drop it now see here-dont get any
raw fool notions in your head about-
well youd better not fight it-

 why

   ive married die lady

chapter xxiii
woman wolf and wilderness

tongs peak is on the northeastern
 edge of middle park at its foot is
grand lake on the peak from its base
where the waters of the lake kiss its foot
far up the sides of where the clouds rest
grow the pine trees dancing across- the
lake come the waves they are always rest-
less chafing and complaining among the
rocks that guard the shores of this moun-
tain lake the waves tell strange tales of
the dark indian tragedies that lie hidden
in the black depths hundreds of feet below

  but at times the lake is quiet and the
waves sleep and only murmur drowsily
in their dreams then the pines whisper
to one another of the things they know and
writhe slowly in sympathy at the scenes
they have beheld

  on the shores of grand lke just at
the foot of the peak stands a ruined log-
cabin the logs are rotting the roof is
fallen in and in winter the snow drifts fill
the empty rooms to the eaves once this
moldering cabin was a hunting lodge owned
by one of the wealthiest men-mason the
millionaire

  his winter leisure was spent in forced
social gaiety in denver in the empty soul-
destroying life of city pleasure seldom ele-
vating always frivolous to the lodge he
came in summer to hunt and fish his
family he brought with him his fashion-
able wife attended by a maid born in
paris black mammy the negress of the
old south and the little elf of a child
called ruth 

  the maid took care of the ennuied
mother who pined and complained for she
knew not what and vented her spleen on
every one even on little ruth

  to ruth this queen of fashion was a
strange beautiful goddess a bad fairy
such as black mammy told her of when
she laid her sleepy golden head on her
breast and was hushed to sleep but this
divinity was no mother

  ruth often wondered if the tall stately
woman was an angel mammy had once
shown her a picture of an angel these
thoughts ruth told not even to black mam-
my but only to her baby her real baby


the railroad mans magazine

the one made of rag that her dusky nurse
had created for her

  of the beautiful wax creations works of
mechanical art which the stately woman
had given her ruth stood somewhat in
awe to ruth they looked and acted like
the giver

  between ruth and her nurse were many
secrets the chief one was a little leather
bag securely hidden beneath the childs
clothing no one except the wearer and
the giver knew of this no one ever saw
it for no one except black mammy ever
dressed the child

   por this treasure the great-hearted hoo-
doo-haunted african woman had given the
earnings of seventy-seven days to a heart-
less charlatan in it was a snakes tooth
a rabbit foot and the talons of a wild tur-
key this charm against all evil ruth
had worn ever since she could remember

  human-like one day ruth became an-
gered-with unreasoning causeless child-
ish furv perhaps inherited-against her
guardian no one loved her thought ruth
to herself she would go away would go
away up the wonderful mountain to where
the clouds grew there were the angels
oh so good to little girls and the fairies
-who always played

  black mammy had told her so and
black mammy knew but she was angry
at black mammy she would be revenged
she went to the edge of the lake-a for-
bidden spot-and threw into the dark water
the priceless all-protecting bag

  terror-stricken at what she had done
the child fled to her nurse and begged her
to come and get it back as frantic as the
child the negro woman reached the rocky
edge just in time to see the water-soaked
charm slowly sink into the depths then
for the first time in fear-frenzied anger
the slave to superstition struck the little girl

  recoiling from her first blow-and from
black mammy too-the heartbroken child
fled to the woods and disappeared among
the trees going straight up the mountain
to the angels and the fairies the negress
groveled in prayer beseeching mercy from
the non-existing spirits of her mind

  soon after this mason came down the
mountain in triumph he bore the grizzly
skin of a timber wolf his first one and the
first kill of the season there had been
two of them mates one he had killed
the female escaped wounded on one fore-
foot

  mason had followed the bloody tracks
in swift pursuit but had lost them while
trailing the crippled wolf he had fired at

and wounded a doe but had neglected fur-
ther search for her because of his eager
chase of more exciting game the skin
of the dog-wolf was to be dressed lined
with costly silk and made into a robe for
little ruth

  mason loved his little daughter the
mother languidly suggested that the skin
would do better as a floor rug pangs of
something like disgust for his hollow life
and remorse for neglect of the good the
beautiful and the true-which to him were
personified in little ruth-all that day had
been gnawing at the mans soul

  each hour the ache had grown more de-
fined with a shadow of disappointment
-not unmixed with contempt and anger-
on his face mason sought ruth

  ruth was gone where no one knew
from black mammy came only half-in-
sane lamentations as she raved about devils
evil spirits and untold horrors and pointed
to the mountain top

  ruth was lost lost in the forest that
covers longs peak and stretches away for
miles over the rocky mountains

  for an instant mason was stunned
then he raised his rifle and sent bullet
after bullet skipping over the glassy waters
almost but not quite directly toward a
group of cabins half hidden on a distant
shore of the lake

  the ringing shots fired as fast as human
skill could work a rifle and the spray-
dashing bullets brought a man out from
among the cabins to the shore the moun-
tains too took up the call and rang and
echoed with the mimic thunder of the gun

  a cry for help oft repeated went trem-
bling faintly across the uneasy- waters
little ruth was known and loved by every
man woman child dog and horse- for
miles ruth was lost

  keen hunters who had trailed wild ani-
mals ever since boyhood took up the trail
like indians others less skilful hunted
in all directions at random men on horse-
back dashed over every road and trail for
help a child was lost in the woods-
woods through which prowled and slunk
wild animals dangerous even to armed
men night was coming on

  some souls are like some ears dull to
finer things till a blow shall cause the
tangled threads of feeling to unravel and
mason the grizzly



let into the inner part emotions heretofore
unknown

  what an hour before had been a stately
living statue was now a woman-a mother
now she was kneeling in silent prayer
now raving in wild grief now cursing her-
self now staring before her at nothing
mason hard as frozen iron gave quiet
clear-cut orders

  on the shore of the lake not far from
the rotting cabin is a huge rock hurled
ages ago down the mountain-side and into
the lake on the tip of this stood a-
woman now truly queenly her long red-
dish golden hair was flying in the evening
breeze which was just beginning to sweep
down the peak and out over the waters of
the lake

  the white summit of the peak was
sparkling like frosted silver in the eve-
ning sunlight against an eastern sky of
the softest blue at timber-line the purple
vapors of a mountain evening were begin-
ning to gather among the trees like a
titan statue in colors seemed this queenly
mother -on the rock

  slowly the blue vapors left the trees
floated into the darkening air and shaped
themselves into the form of a child with
its baby arms folded across its breast and
with its face uplifted to heaven toward
which it was slowly rising as the sunlight
glorified the cloud it took upon itself liv-
ing tints the flowing curls turned to
gold and the robe was white the cloud
thus wreathed by nature was a vision in
the blue evening sky of little ruth

  suddenly the white robe was blotched with
scarlet the form writhed and squirmed
became more ethereal all was white and
the now angel form had a pair of snowy
wings slowly the vapor arose above the
summit slowly it spread its white pin-
ions slowly it outstretched its arms in a
farewell kiss to the spellbound statue be-
low then it disappeared in the transpar-
ent turquoise of the evening air

  the western sky was overcast it was
dark on the waters of the lake motion-
less on the rock the queenly mother tood
suddenly in the clear mountain air on a
bare point of rock far up the mountain-
side little ruth stood forth this was
no cloud it was ruth herself

  a single ray of sunlight pierced the
black clouds in the west and lit up the lost
fear-crazed child like a halo the hunt-
ers saw her too with a shout they all

started for what is to this day called the
rock of ruth the wild baby frightened
anew by the voices turned and disappeared
into the dark aisles of the forest

  a womans shriek chilled through the
night it was answered by the distant cry
of a panther the echoes took up both
cries mingled them into one horrid sound
and sent it quavering from crag to crag
through every glen as silence came once
more the soul-freezing howl of a wolf a
cry of suffering and of revenge again made
rasping chaos of the evening stillness

  search was useless all was darkness
the placid lake reflected not a point of
light for the stars had draped themselves
in cloudy blackness

  that night the snow came all through
the night the mothers cries were answered
by the yells of a panther on longs peak
the wolf was silent

  one little shoe a blood-rimmed hole
worn through the sole was all of his baby
ruth that mason after days of search laid
in the lap of the now awakened mother

  one day a hard-faced man with the
desperate hunted look of a criminal came
to mason and told him of a fair-haired
child held captive by an old indian wom-
an who led the life of a hermit a diseased
outcast from her tribe banished to die alone
in the wilderness like hagar

  the man asked for blood-money mason
leaped upon tire human brute but weak
from suffering his attack was worse than
useless the man fled never to return
far and wide he was sought by men with
ropes at their saddle-liorns but he was
never found

  black mammy had vanished the last
seen of her she was kneeling on the edge
of the lake where ruth had cast in the
priceless charm kneeling with her black
outstretched arms raised to the little girl
as she stood sunlit outlined against the
evening sky on the point of rock the
waves often whisper strange tales of what
they and no one else know

  where was ruth masons millions and
his mind and heart centered on this alone

chapter xxiv
in the mountains

vjlfhen ruth fled up the mountain
smarting under the heretofore un-
known insult of a blow she was going


the railroad mans magazine

straight to the home of the fairies up in
the beautiful sky no one on earth loved
her she said in her childish heart-and
perhaps truthfully-except black mammy

   to this little girl for the time the negro
woman was the world and now the whole
world abused her soon however the baby
fell over a root and struck her tender
cheek in the same place where it was yet
bruised and aching from the blow of her
nurse her precious bag was in the lake

  this must be one of those ugly black
things which hurt and sometimes eat little
girls when they are naughty so black
mammy had said with a shrill shriek
the baby arose and endowed with the
false strength given even to- the grown by
fear clambered up the rocks and through
the tangled underbrush with frantic haste

  often when a man-a leader among his
kind in civilized life-becomes bewildered
in the labyrinth of the woods and moun-
tains in a few hours his mind under the
awful pressure of nature at such a time
becomes unbalanced and lie rushes head-
long in all directions in a few moments
little ruth was a wild animal bereaved of
sanity and guided only by the animal in-
stincts which are intuitive in the young of
all creatures those of man not excepted

  endowed with new-found strength ruth
climbed the mountain with a rapidity im-
possible under other circumstances and
fully as fast as could a man impediments
which to a larger frame would have been
impossible were easily passed through or
under by little ruth under fallen logs
she crept on all fours and through the
interwoven underbrush close to the ground
she went like a rabbit from far below
came the sounds of pursuit

  once indeed did ruth abnormally
sharpened ears catch the sound of ap-
proaching footsteps hiding behind a
rock she saw her breathless father pass
within a few feet of her when he shout-
ed out her name in a voice heard a mile
away the xhild crouched to the ground like
a fawn when he had passed on along the
mountain-side but was still in sight his
back turned ruth darted into a thicket and
noiselessly made her way up the steep in-
cline stopping now and then to hide and
rest when she heard the noise of a searcher
near	

  at last they were all below her for a
while she climbed up always up through
brushwood impassable for a man fright-

ened and wounded animals always run up-
hill why no one knows

  suddenly ruth reached a clear spot on
the edge of a precipice below her lay the
lake and the smaller mountains stepping
with the assurance of a mountain goat out
to the very edge she nimbly climbed to the
tip of a projecting crag above her hung
the cloud but ruth saw it not

  here they saw her last far below in
the bluish depths of the evening air ruth
saw her mother for one fleeting instant
reason returned she uttered a cry for her
mother and toddled on the edge about to
fall hundreds of feet to the now black rocks
below but the horror of it all instantly
banished reason and the little girl was an
animal again-cool sure-footed and keen
with the guidance of instinct

  the joyful shouts of the hunters reached
her ears like a lamb before the dogs she
turned sprang down the jagged point of
rock and darted up the timbered slope

  night was coming on when it is dark
in the village it is still light where ruth
was twilight loves to linger on the moun-
tain heights for an hour ruth had heard
a creeping sound slowly stealing upon her
at times it was behind her at others above
her or to the right or left but usually above
her

  as she darted from the point of rock and
ran beneath the shadows of the pines a
great yellow cat bounded away from her
up the mountain fearing nothing-for in
humans instinct is never perfect-and dim-
ly recognizing an exaggerated likeness to
the house-pet of black mammy ruth
scrambled on after the panther calling

  kitty kitty-prettv kitty i wont
urt ou

  the panther stopped sprang into a tree
and snarled through its teeth ruth ran
beneath the limb and reached up her baby
arms then from the beast came the
screech that the mother and hunters heard

  with this horrid cry the cowardly brute
leaped from the tree far out into the con-
cealing undergrowth disappointed and
aggrieved and more lonely now than ever
ruth climbed on up the mountain

  the fairies and the angels were now for-
gotten instinct that of a young animal
alone ruled her mind the air was be-
coming cold strange shapes were appear-
ing and disappearing here and there before
the childs glassy eyes

  her breath came in quick short gasps
mason the grizzly



her foot was hurting her it was bleeding
she pulled off her shoe and threw it over
a cliff a faint remembrance of the charm
and the lake-edge was called to her mind 
with it came the horror and the terror that
possessed her then

   she stood grasping a bent twig for sup-
port letting go it rebounded and struck
her injured cheek again that blow with
a pitiful cry the child made frantic pace up
the rocks her bare foot leaving bloody
tracks behind

   a plaintive cry child-like in its plead-
ing complaining treble almost an echo of
that of ruths came from below her not
far distant savage nostrils were hotly
sniffing the bloody little footprints

  faintly up the mountain came a cry of
anguish from the distant depths the
voice and tone were strange to ruth she
heard them not

   every muscle aching chilled to the bone
and reeling for a sudden want of sleep the
lost baby staggered into a thicket and
against a fallen log this log had lain
here for fifty years once it had been a
mountain king for a century but it was
npw decayed and the black ants had eaten
out its heart till the log was a mere shell
cut through in places on the underside

   unable to get under the obstruction and
lacking strength to clamber over ruth felt
her way along it feeling slowly in the
gathering darkness her little hands found
a warm hairy mass it was a deer sick
from a bullet-wound and helpless because
of the paralyzing fear caused by those
childlike cries from a savage throat so near

   freezing half naked as she was little
ruth crowded close to this warm body lying
beside and partly beneath the lo hesi-
tated a moment then crawled close in be-
tween the doe and the arching log with a
sigh of relief grateful for the warmth the
baby snuggled close to the wounded animal
and slept

  the wounded doe her wildness overcome
by suffering their mutual danger and an
instinctive knowledge of coming death-
the chill of whidi was already thickening
her blood-was thankful too for the pres-
ence and the warmth of the child

  two days before the doc had returned
to fills very clump of bushes to find her
fawn hidden not long before with all the
cunning of a wild mother gone in its
place only a mass of bloody leaves while
great daw marks scarred the log the

keenest of noses told her that the yellow
murderess still lingered

  one lacked a mother the other an off-
spring in the night ruth awoke the
deer was trembling two lurid balls of
greenish-yellow fire burned a dozen feet
above them ruth hungry and with every
nerve stinging with pain began to cry at
the sound of the human voice again did
that horrid screech of the panther echo
among the mountains a dark supple
form slipped noiselessly as a shadow from
the limb overhead and disappeared yet
hungered near then faintly through the
night the cry of a heart-torn woman came
quivering from the airy depths

  finally ruth fell asleep the blood-
sapped deer was chilled to the heart both
were cold the wind came up cold and
biting -

  around them in slowly narrowing circles
a prowling crawling form tracked a spiral
in the snow with the deer and the baby as
the center-and the end the odor of a
human being still held that fanged danger
at bay but the night was almost gone and
for two days the panther had not eaten
her last meat had been a fawn in that very
thicket

  daylight came through the air from
a dark pine-tree like a curving ray of sun-
light flashed a yellow snarl with a death
cry - low pleading gasping-the deer
bounded into the air with the panther on
her back what followed is not for human
eyes yet ruth saw it all motionless se-
curely hidden in her still warm bed beneath
the log the baby watched this world-old
tragedy of the woods

  the dark green trees the gray deer the
yellow panther with dripping jaws the
far-away dawn-obscured background of
the purple mountains the molten silver of
the lake in the dusky depths the rosy-
tinted glittering peak above-all made a
picture seldom seen and never to be for-
gotten

  other eyes hungrily watched the kill far
above among the rocks a wolf looked down
three of her footprints in the fresh snow
were perfect the fourth showed the marks
of a bloody shattered bone and a dragging
foot the hungry wolf licked her own
blood from the frozen paw now hanging to
the jagged stump only by a half-gnawed
sinew

  gorged to the utmost hastened by fear
of the child-seekers coming up the moun-


the railroad mans magazine

tain the panther-with a mass of venison in
her mouth-lightly and noiselessly bound-
ed away to he- young in a cave across the
gulch

the hunters never found the dead deer
ruth crunched wide-eyed beneath the log

chapter xxv
a little child

t n the city it was nearly midnight the
christmas bells were singing in the
frost eager to peal forth  glory to god in
the highest

  the year before one of the palaces that
grace capitol hill of denver had been lit
by a hundred lights in the great hall there
had been a silver spruce that reached from
polished floor to gilded ceiling here had
danced the wealthy and the gay of denver
up near the roof in a dark room a portly
negro woman had been lowly singing a fe-
verish neglected baby to sleep

  on the dancing floor that night the gid-
diest of the gay and thoughtless crush had
been the mother that was a year before

  this night the pile of gray stone was
dark only from one window came light-
a window near the caves here the waver-
ing light told of a fire dancing in a grate
of an otherwise darkened room

  in this room on a wolfskin rug before
the open fire in ruths room lay a woman
her form was queenly but broken the
tawny hair-not unlike that of a panther-
now lusterless was lined with silver here
and there the eyes were red but dry
they ached wealth she had and what
wealth could buy but not happiness

  on the now shrunken neck was a string
of pearls once they had graced the breast
of a doge of venice before the woman
between the stiffened ears of the ghastly
leering stuffed head of the wolf was a
jewel-box

  in it was a babys shoe-soiled torn and
weather-beaten-with a dark-rimmed hole
through the sole the palace was hers
the world had been ransacked to adorn it
the priceless scrap-pile of five continents
was hers-yet she grieved

  from the frozen street below came a
scream through the icy air it sounded
clear and cruel to the silently moaning
woman lying on the gray hide before the
fire it was only the cry of a laughing
girl as she slipped intentionally  the side-

walk and not unwillingly fell back into her
lovers arms 

  to the childless mother above the laugh
was the screech of a panther she tore
from her neck the string of jewels pearls
rolled over the floor like marbles the one
remaining in her hand the largest-a gem
once the wonder of a venetian court-this
soul - wrung woman ground between her
teeth and broke both jewel and teeth what
cared she had not savage jaws crunched
a thing more precious

  on the frozen slopes of longs peak that
night stood a gaunt she-wolf dying of hun-
ger with the others of her kind she could
not hunt she a cripple she must hide
alone or serve as meat for the famished
pack

  to her old den in the rocks far above
timber-line-she had returned many days
she had been away in the den were the
frozen skin-covered bones of her cubs she
ate them two months before she had seen
her mate die wounded herself unable to
crawl spring or run she had seen her
young slowly starve

  desperate with hunger for herself and
young she had once painfully dragged to
the den the skinned carcass of a male wolf
and the torn remnants of a doe on this
they had lived when it failed she left on
three feet in search of meat the cubs
starved and died

  to-night she had climbed the heights to
the den to die

  over the top of the white peak slowly
rose a burnished shield set it was in a
field of darkest blue studded with stars
framed with the softest of black clouds
edged with dazzling white the shadow
of the lone wolf standing  the rock shot
far down the white mountainside like a
black spear the end of the shadow dis-
appeared in the inky depths of a thicket
far below

  the eyes of the wolf ranged for a hun-
dred miles the frozen moonlit scene of
black and white the lake was gone all
was whitedown there all was still cold
dead the world was dark and dead the
wolf lifted her head to give tongue to that
which alone could make the scene more
drear

  as the gaunt hand was lifted the end of
the shadow left the black thicket the
wolf stopped still silent in that thicket
she had had her last taste of living blood
how the warm blood had spurted hot and
mason the grizzly



teeming in the frosty air when she sunk her
teeth into the gurgling throat

  this remembrance gave the wolf new
life down the glittering slope she flew
with great leaps unmindful of the tender
stump like the shadow of death she en-
tered into the thicket the middle of it was
clear here rotted a great log here the
moon shone like a glazed sun through
the frozen crust the wolf dug with a single
paw her jaws seized a bone and pulled it
to the surface the bone was dry and bare
and chalky

  a howl of a wolf echoed from the crags
and cliffs of longs peak in the awful cry
was hunger death despair revenge tri-
umph and justice in the howl was the
life strength of a timber-wolf

  down on the shores of the frozen lake
in a log cabin a bride-mother heard that
agoriy go freezing by and she hugged
closer her new - born the mountaineer
glanced at his rifle and at the barred door

  at the foot of the peak a half-grown
buck which that day had won his first
fight heard that cry and crowded under
the belly of his dam throwing both into
the snow where they lay bleating in help-
less terror

  the echoes carried the she-wolfs cleath-
cry miles away through the soundless
night and faintly into a panthers den
the great cat standing over her young
shuddered at that cry bristled and bared
her teeth and snarled two clumsy cubs
that had been rolling ball-like playing
with the gnawed hoof of a deer slunk close
to the panther mother

  as the last note rolled from between the
yellow fangs the death-rattle sounded in
the throat of the dying wolf in the last
paroxysm the wolf clenched her teeth into
the dry bone on which rested the now
bleeding stump the bone cracked and
split between the iron jaws there it
stayed the bone was a childs skull

  in the presidents private office a man
sat in his chair asleep his face was
gaunt as lincolns the man shuddered

the

and jerked now and then in his fitful
sleep suddenly he aroused himself wear-
ily passed his hands through his gray
twisted mass of hair and pressed them
hard over his hollow eyes but nothing
could shut out the blood-congealing image
of a frozen peak with a black lake at its
foot

  the sight of a mountain of crusted sil-
ver froze his burning mind long he sat
looking straight ahead of him into nothing-
ness then slowly he said

  this is the life of a coward if she
is under that crust i can at least live for
others-and for her mother

  brute in your selfishness you have
thought only of yourself-of your own sor-
row you have left her your wife her
mother without help to bear her load
alone hers is the greater burden - she
does not love me but we both love her

i	will go to her and i will help her

  he pushed away from the paper-littered
table as a thing abhorrent as fast as horse
could go mason went to his home

  just within the door of the dim fire-lit
room he stopped and bowed his head un-
conscious of his presence the woman on the
wolf-skin was still fondling the babys shoe
reverently he went and knelt beside her

  a look a cry the gulf that had al-
ways yawned between them was bridged in
silence too deep for words for the first
time in their lives this man and this woman
met face to face mind to mind heart to
heart soul to soul-knew each other and
their own inner selves

  invisible baby hands knitted together the
fibers of their mutual being

   stealing clear on the still blue air came
the tones of a single bell-then burst the
merry metal chorus welling swelling chi-
ming merrily the glad christmas tidings
the woman raised her face and moaned
ruth ruth ruth-oh heaven give

brain teasers

fritz gannon helena montana contributes all of the teasers
in this number

    	a car-checker has a string of seven cars each containing a
number consisting of six figures after entering down the numbers he
is surprised to find that not only do the numbers of the first six cars
contain the same figures but he also notices that the number on the
second car is twice as great that of the third three times as great
that of the fourth four times as great that of the fifth five times as
great and that of the sixth six times as great as the number on the
first car he checked the seventh car has a number containing none of
the figures to be found on the other six yet the number on the seventh
car is seven times as great as that on the first what were the numbers
on the cars

    	a conductor in making up a freight-train has to cut out a
certain number of cars from three tracks ke finds that there are 
more cars on track no  than on no  and  more on no  than
on no  he cuts out from no  one-half the cars and a half a car
besides from no  he cuts out one-fourth the cars and a fourth of a
car besides from no  he cuts out one-sixth of the cars and a sixth
of a car besides after doing so there are ten more cars on track no 
than on no  and ten more on no  than on no  how many cars
were there at first on each of thy three tracks

on the editorial carpet

        where we get flagged by our readers and
        find an exhaust for our own high pressure

our running-orders for april arc ready they
look pretty good to us when we say this
we mean that they are a little better than any
running-orders we have had at any previous time
and for any previous run

  scanning the sheet we find that three new
serials will start with april they are just as
intense and gripping in their way as those which
close with this number-thwre are no blocks
caused by washouts or broken rails no leaky
joints or broken valve-stems-but a clear track
all the way

 the first serial is the thousand-mile
ticket by dan duane which introduces a
character somewhat similar in bravado fearless-
ness and adventure to seth waters who made the
chapters of  in the hornets nest  so interesting

   baker of the bad lands  is by walter t per-
cival a writer whom we are introducing for the
first time it is a story that deals-with stirring ad-
ventures of border life of a time when it took
more than grit and force to build a railroad

  c w beels who has contributed a number of
clever short stories to our pages will appear with
his first serial it is called dr jourdans mys-
tery ami deals with the remarkable transforma-
tion of a man who was destined to be a crook

  there will be another thrilling story of frontier
life by r m west whose narrative  a frontier
man-hunt appears in this number all of mr
wests stories are based on real happenings and
are truthful pictures of the most romantic days
in the building of our west

  the latest development in locomotives and
other important phases of railroad life will be
described by one of our most practical writers

  walter gardner seaver will be aboard with
an unusually good batch of roundhouse tales

  another particularly interesting article will tell
of the struggles of the first builders of the rail-
road-of the days when george stephenson was
trying to make his wonderful invention prove its
worth this article will relate the court proceed-
ings of a suit brought by certain canal owners
and landed proprietors of great britain to pre-
vent the construction of a railroad one of the
most learned lawyers on the opposing side told
mr stephenson that it was impossible to run a
train through a tunnel because the snow would
blow into the tunnel turn to ice and thereby block
the trains progress

  wliat do you think of that

  the buffer aifd the vestibule arc important
parts of every train they have a history of their
own like all other railroad improvements their
importance is described in this number

  in  ten thousand miles by rail gilson
willets will take a jump from missouri through
the sun flower state where he collected a num-
ber of good yarns

  these are only a few of the special features
that we care to mention just now we reserve
the right to start up a few genuine surprises

  in the short fiction line there will be nine or
ten stories of the sort for which the railroad
maxs magazine is famous we wish to state
with our accustomed modesty that i he short
stories we are printing are attracting more than
ordinary attention we always believed they
would they are selected with the greatest care
and represent phases of life that thrill with energy
life determination and humor such as no other
magazine can present

   in april the experiences of our friends  honk
and horace in oklahoma are told in mr em-
met f hartes best vein robert fulkerson
hoffman has just completed -a new story in his
most delightful style which we will present
augustus wittfeld macduffie martin felix g
prentice george foxhall and others will be in
evidence

  in short our april number will be a corker
we are not trying to blow off while hot about its
excellence there are no cracked sheets or broken
stay-bolts-the water in the gage-glass of our
hopes is fluctuating with the water-line in the
boiler of our energy and it looks as if we have
a good run ahead of us

the railroad clubs

surprise has many times been expressed
that more real benefit to the railroads of this
country has not been obtained through the or-
ganized railroad clubs located in the principal
railroad centers throughout america says the
american engineer and railroad journal while
of course all of these clubs are of more or less
value to their members this becomes insignificant
when il is considered what they might be not only
to their own members but also to the members
of all other clubs here is really a clearing-
house for the observations and experiences of the




the railroad mans magazine

 t

best men in the country already organized from
which not one-tenth part of their value is avail-
able for general use

  mr c e turner several years ago suggested
that all of the clubs throughout the country dis-
cuss the same subject at corresponding meetings
mr vaughan in bis presidential address before
the master mechanics association in  sug-
gested that the railroad clubs should be depended
upon to thoroughly thrash out the subjects which
were to come before the association so diat de-
cisive and positive conclusions could be reached
on the various important subjects that were
brought up

  both of these suggestions are excellent and it
is now further suggested that all of the clubs
affiliate info one organization and that a perma-
nent secretary provided with suitable office-force
and properly recompensed be employed further
that the american railway association be re-
quested to name a consulting board who should
decide w hat subjects are most worthy of discus-
sion and that the permanent secretary through
the medium of the local secretaries obtain papers
to be presented by each of the various clubs on
this subject where it could be thoroughly and
completely discussed the papets with the dis-
cussion should be returned to the permanent
secretary who would condense them and put the
whole matter into suitable shape for publication
and for the use of the committee who might be
preparing a report on the same subject for one
of the national associations

  this suggestion while capable of criticism on
a number of points and possibly not suitable for
adoption in its entirety still has many points
of practicability and if something of this kind
could be brought about the proceedings of the
associated railroad clubs of america would be
the most valuable source of information on rail-
road topics that could possibly be compiled and
with the certainty assured of results which in
prospect are now largely speculative

 the riddle of the cross-head

since publication of the reply to  e t 
-southampton long island in  by the light
of the lantern  for january we have received a
number of critical though kindly letters inteided
to straighten out our interpretation of the so-
called cross-had problem we have been greatly
pleased to receive these communications because
all evince a friendly and appreciative interest in
his popular department on which we have worked
untiringly to perfect we do not object to a  call
down when you think that you have it on us
no matter whether as in this case the shoe scarce-
ly happens to fit

  the cross-head question as originally pro-
pounded to the best of our recollection ran as
follows

   does the cross-head of a locomotive move

backward in the guides or do the guides move
forward over the cross-head

  we replied that the cross-head did move back-
ward in the guides which it does irrespective of
the fact that it must be necessarily earned always
ahead provided that the locomotive is running
forward

  to make this entirely xlear the answer in the
january  lantern  department was based on a
consideration of the relation between the cross-
head and the locomotive which carries it and with
no consideration of the relation between the cross-
bead and some fixed point foreign to the locomo-
tive as for instance the ground or the rail

  xo such connection however was suggested in
the correspondents letter under the conditions
mentioned the reply as given is absolutely correct
it now appears that this time-honored query
which is largely a trick must not take into ac-
count the relation of the cross-head to the guides
but to the rail or ground

  it does not require labored diagrams and lengthy
explanations to prove that no matter in which di-
rection the cross-head may be moving it can never
return to a point over the rail where it may have
been before this can be shown by the most ele-
mentary application of simple algebra but before
proceeding with the demonstration we would like
to impress that the cross-head does not move any-
where except back and forth in the guides as we
said in january

  its movement in the direction in which the
locomotive is going is simply because it is carried
along with the locomotive of which it is with its
guides a component part

  assuming

diameter of driving-wheel	 x

stroke of piston	 y

circumference of driving-wheel   x

  on the lower half of one revolution going for-
ward the locomotive moves forward in relation to

the rail a distance 	at the same time the

cross-head moves backward relative to the guides
a distance  y at the same time the cross-
head is also curried forward relative to the rail
a distance  y when on this half of the stroke
the cross-head is curried forward relative to the

rail a distance 	 y

  on the other upper half of the revolution the
locomotive moves forward the same distance
 lx and the cross-head moves forward rela-
tive to the guides a distance  y then on
this half of the stroke the cross-head is carried for-
ward relative to the rail a distance  - x v

                        j

  taking the entire strokes revolution to-
gether we find that the locomotive has moved for-
ward relative to the rail a distance  x and that
the cross-head has been carried forward relative to
the rail a distance  -y	- y  tx

or the same as the locomotive qcd

  the long and short of it is that the cross-head
on the editorial carpet



goes regularly back and forth in the guides but
while all this is going on it is being carried
ahead with its guides by the locomotive to which
they are attached it might be roughly illustrated
by a ball thrown between two men on either end
of a flat car in motion the ball moves back and
forth between the men but it can never return to
a point in relation to the track which it has once
left

 we feel impelled to quote a sentence from one-
letter of those received on this matter in
your answer you claim that it the cross-head
moves backward which it does not and at no
time docs it stand still

  for the benefit of this particular correspondent
ye want to demonstrate how easily the cross-head
might stand still if proper proportions or dimen-
sions were present he may be surprised to know
that such diameter of wheel and such length of
stroke can be assumed as to make  y  o
j e that the cross-head under such assumption
is actually stationary in relation to the rail for
the upper half of the stroke

  example

        let x  

        let y  

       then x   x   

      then - 

       and lis - y  o

  although we could not use any of the diagrams
and explanatory matter which several correspond-
ents kindly sent with their letters we are grateful
for them because they establish that in the cross-
head problem the rail or ground is the point to
be considered had the original question con-
tained this information we would have proceeded
long ago with the simple explanation as above
but in view of this omission our answer was pos-
sibly not as elaborate and satisfying as it might
have been

fuel oil in the northwest

as soon as locomotives of the northern pacific
and the tacoma eastern railroadsjn wes-
tern washington can be equipped with oil-burners
all engines on the main lines traversing the forest
sections of the state will be using oil instead of
coal thereby eliminating one of the greatest
dangers from forest fires

  president williams of the chicago milwaukee
and puget sound announces that the tacoma
eastern locomotives will be equipped with oil-
burners early next spring the tacoma eastern
runs through a great virgin forest part within
the rainier national forest and part owned by
private corporations

  all the other milwaukee lines running through
the forests arc already equipped with oil-burners
the oregon-washington railroad and naviga-
tion company and the great northern railways

now use california oil as fuel where their lines
penetrate the forests the northern pacific is
making preliminary investigations with a view to
making the same changes on the west end of the

system



the prevention of smoke

the comparative absence of smoke in berlin
is claimed to be due partly to the use of fuel
briquettes consul general a w thackara
stales that  per cent of the coal-fuel consumed
in the city and suburbs is brown coal briquettes
and it has been technically demonstrated that
having been produced without the addition of
a special binder they burn with less smoke than
any other briquettes considerable coke is also
used in berlin

  the quantity of coal briquettes produced in
germany increased from  tons in 
to about  tons in  and to is-

	tons in  consul albert halstead of
birmingham reports that the manufacture of
coal briquettes has become a large industry in the
united kingdom

  official figures show that in  the produc-
tion for the whole kingdom was  long
tons valued at  this output was di-
vided england  tons valued at -
 wales  tons valued at 
scotland  tons valued at  arid
ireland  tons valued at  the
values given represent the selling-price at the
place of manufacture

a new railroad poet

railroad men in the northern pacific
yards at st paul minnesota often stop to
look at a smooth-shaven slender young switch-
man who has endeared himself to them through
short bits of poetry written during his idle mo-
ments not infrequently is c g byrne seen
perched on top of a box car pencil in hand
writing on a scrap of paper when lie has fin-
ished there is always this request  let me see
byrne some of his productions are worthy of
attention

  not long ago roger the little son of the switch-
man was ill the doctor had given up hope of
saving the boys life sitting at home that night
the father saw the boys engine-a bright toy-
idle on the playroom floor he drew a paper from
his pocket and wrote the touching verses  the
dead engine which appear on page  of
this number

from a lady ham

editor the railroad maxs magazine

if you will permit i would like to say a few
words regarding despatching by telephone

    i have just read operator naugles little
 spiel  in the january magazine t agree with
him there is not an operator in the united
states who likes the telephone why surely
there is a reason in the first place the  tick-
tick of the sounder is the sweetest music an
operator ever heard silence the sounder and the
operator is lonesome and wonders if the wire is
down if his instrument is out of adjustment or
what immediately he will seek the trouble

  a telephone-operator never knows where the
trains arc if they are gaining or losing time or
what trains are coming and going unless he sits
with that harness on his head and who wants
to sit hours and hours listening to the other ope-
rators and hams repeat orders

  in the first place an operator has loo many
other duties to devote all his time to the phone
he can be selling tickets posting the books and
numerous other duties and still keep tab on all
the trains

  some contend that the phone is faster than
telegraphing possibly it is at least a despatcher
can talk fastc-r than he can send but an operator
cannot copy any faster from the telephone he
can write just so fast and no faster no matter
how rapidly the despatcher talks

  another thing it is impossible to copy as far
behind on the phone as you can by telegraph i
have to keep right up with the despatcher else
i lose out i have heard several say the same
thing

  how many operators who have copied and de-
livered orders that had been despatched by phone
felt as confident as if the message had come by
telegraph

  ask the conductors and they will tell you they
dont like to run on orders despatched oyer a
phone during the past month several have told
me they were afraid of phone-orders i must
confess im afraid of them too and i have never
delivered an order that had bec-n despatched by
phone when i wasnt uneasy

  the telephone will never mean to the operators
what the morse does and i see where railroad-
ing is fast losingits charm for me as well as
for thousands of others no matter how big a
 ham  you may be you are willing to keep on
struggling rather than have the phones to con-
tend with am a full-fledged  ham  myself
but i am not willing to work on the phones i
much prefer working on some road where there
are no phones for half the salary

  if the phone is to succeed the morse twenty-
five years from to-day there will be no operators
except those in commercial office any one can
sit downyand in an hour or two learn the book of
rules pass the examination and walk down and
tell us old experienced railroaders where to  head
in what protection have we none whatever

blasts and orders

editor the railroad mans magazine 

in your february number you tell l e gar-
ber missouri that you do not know of any
 such signal as three short blasts of the engine-
whistle perhaps it is not in use on all roads
but on our lines here it is used

  when the conductor of a passenger-train wants
the train stopped at the next station which is in
all probability a flag-stop be gives the engineer
three short blasts on the air-signal whistle the
engineer answers this by three short blasts of the
engine-whistle

  l e also asks is it safe for an operator to
recopy train-orders 

  here on the pennsy we sometimes overlook
our copies in such an event we lay the original
on the editorial carpet



copy over some blank orders and trace them from
the original when we do this we repeat the
recopied order to i he despatches and have him

old-time poems

mr j w wood of muskogee oklahoma
has sent us several noted railroad classics
which have already appeared in the carpel he
sends us another the engineers story which
we append herewith again our thanks to mr
wood

     the engineers story

well yes tis a hair-curlin story-

i would it could not be recalled

        the terrible fright of that hell-tinctured
            night

is the causc of my head bein bald 

i was runnin the git-there express sir

on the yankee creek jenkwater line

an the track along there was as crooked i swear
as the growth of a field pumpkin-vine

my run was a night one an nights on the yank
was as black as the coal piled back there on the
lank

we pulled out of tenderfoot station

a day and a half almost late

an every durn wheel was a poundin the steel

at a wildly extravagant rate	-

my fireman kep piling the coal in
the jaws of the old 

till the sweat from his nose seemed lo play
    through a hose

an splashed round his feet on the floor
as we thundered along like a demon in flight

 a rippin a streak through the breast of the night

as we rounded a curve on the mountain

 full sixty an hour i will swear

just ahead was a sight that with blood-freezin
    flight

would have raised a stuffed buffalos hair

the bridge over ute creek was burnin

the flames shootin up in their glee

my god how they gleamed in the air till they
    seemed

like fiery tongued imps on a spree

jest snickered ansparkled an laughed like they
     knowed

id make my next trip on a different road

 in frenzy i reached for the throttle

but twas stuck and refused to obey

 yelled in affright for our maddening flight
i felt that i never could stay

then wildly i grasped the big lever

threw her over then held my hot breath

an waited for what i assuredly thought
was a sure and a terrible death 

then came the wild crash an with horror-fringed
     yell

down into that great fiery chasm i fell

when i came to myself i was lying
on the floor of my bedroom my wife
sat on top of my form an was makin it warm
for her darling-you bet your sweet life

my hair she had clutched in her fingers

and was jamming my head on the floor

yet i yelled with delight when i found that my
    fright

was a horrible dream-nothing more

  had wildly grabbed one of her ankles she said
 and reversed her clear over the head of the bed

seven- men dead on the prairie and seven homes
    flooded with woes

and to think that i should have done it when
    ere many suns should set

i	hoped to pmbrace my brother-and this is the
    way weve met

he with his dead eyes gazing up to the distant sky

and t his murderer standing living and un-

well his fate is the best one mine to behold
    his corse

haunting my life forever-doomed to a vain
    remorse

how shall i bear its shadows how could this

oh my brother fnd playmate would i had
    died for thee 

pardon my weak emotion bury them here my

where minutes
mean miles

   a minutes a minute to most men but
 minutes mean miles to you men on the road
 a minute slow or a minute fast and you may-
 be a mile behind or a mile ahead of your
 schedule

   weve made a watch that measures those
 miles to perfection it is a south bend
 watch called the studebaker

   six months are spent just in making and
 putting the parts together another six
 months are required to bring this watch to
 its marvelous accuracy a full year on one
 watch is not uncommon but the watch is
 uncommon when it is finished

  sixty different men each contributes his
 skill in its making each watch gets over
 four hundred inspections each must run
 continuously for thirty days and nights and
 keep accurate time or it isnt sent out

   no other watch in the world can compare
 with it

   see the studebaker at your jewelers
 only first-class jewelers sell it such
 jewelers can give it the personal
 adjustment that every good
 watch needs

          i

   the way you carry a watch
 affects it the man who sits at
 the throttle subjects his watch
 to the jars and jolts occasioned by the
 rocking of the locomotive-the man who

 supplies the steam is continually leaning
 backward and forward keeping his fire at
 the right point-the man who carries the
 lantern is constantly jumping on and off
 the train and hurrying to and fro-each of
 these men subjects a watch to entirely dif-
 ferent treatment and his watch must be
 one that can be regulated to offset the
 conditions under which it is carried

 the studebaker can be so regulated

 go to your jeweler and get the stude-
 baker-the watch which has met the most
 exacting railroad requirements

 the studebaker is made with  and
  jewels and costs only a trifle more than
 common watches

a living from poultry

note the condition of them three nmnilis old pullets these pullets and their ancestor for seten
irem-raiioiin have never been allowed to run outside the coops

hens in ten months on a city
 feet square

 from 
lot

to the average poultry-
man that would seem
impossible and when we tell
you that we have actually
done a  poultry bus-
iness with  hens on a
corner in the city garden 
feet wide by  feet long
we are simply stating facts
it would not be possible to
get such returns by any one
of the systems of poultry
keeping recommended and
practiced by the american
people still it can be ac-
complished by the

philo
system

the philo system is unlike all other wavs of keeping
poultry

am in many respects just the reverse accomplishing things in poultry work
that have always been coneldeied impossible and getting unheard-of results
that are hard t believe without seeing

the new system covers all branches op the work
necessary for success

from selecting the breeders to marketing the product it tells how to t egg
that will hatch how to hatch nearly every egg and how to raise nearly all the
chicks batched it gives complete plans iu derail how to make everything
necessary to run the business and at less than half the rout required to handle
the poultry business in any other manner

two-pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a - pace of less than a square foot to the broiler and the broiler
are nfthe very beat quality bringing here  cents a pound above tne highest
market price

our six-month-old pullets are laying at the rate of
 eggs each per month

in a space of two square feet f r each bird no green cut hone of any descrip-
tion l- fed and tne food used is inexpensive as compared with foo l other
are using

   our new book tiie philo system of poultry keeping gives fui
particulars regarding these wonderful diat-ovci-ies with simple easy-to-
uuderstand directions that are iiiiht  the point ami i paxes of ilustra-
tions showing all branches of the work from start to hnlsli

dont let the chicks die in the shell

   ore of the secrets of success is to save all the chickens that are fully de-
veloped at hatching time whether they can crack the shell or not it is t
simple trick and believed to be the secret of ihe ancient egyptians and
chinese which enabled them to sell the chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at fifteen cents a bushel

our book tells how to make the best green food with but little trouble and
have a good supply any day in the year winter or summer it is just as

impossible to set a large egg yield without irreeu food as it is to keep a cow
without hay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on each chicken

no lamp required no danrer of chilling over-heating or burning up th
chickens as with brooders usin lamps or any kind o tire they also keep th
lice off the chicken automatically or kill any that may be on them when
placed in the brooder our book give full plans and the right to make and
use them one can easily be made iu an hour at a cost ot  to  cents

testimonials

my dkar mr piiiio  -	valley falls n y oct  

after another years work with your system of poultry keeping making
threa ears iu all i am thoroughly convinced of its practicability i raise i
all my chicks in your brooder-coops containing your fireless brooders and
kept them there until the were nearly matured decreasing the number in
each coop however as they grew in size those who have visited my plant
have been unanimous in their praise of my birds raised by this system

sincerely yours	irev  e b tcmpler

mr e k phiio elmira n y	elmira n y oct so 

dear sir -no doubt   n will be interested to learn of our success in keep-
ing poultry by the philo system our first years work is now nearly com-
pleted il has given us an income of over co from six pedigree hens and
one cockerel had we understood the work as well as we now do after a
years experience we could easily have made over  from the six liens
in addition to ihe profits from the sale of pedigree chicks we have cleared
over  running our hatchery plant consisting of  cycle hatchers v-
are pleased with the results and expect to do better the coming year wit
best wishes we are	very truly yours mrs c p goodrich

mr e r phiio elmira n y	south britain conn april  

dear sir-i have followed your system as close as i could  ihe result is x
complete success if there can he any improvement on nature your brooder
is it the first experience i had with your system was last december i
batched  chicks under two hens put them as soon as hatched in one f
your brooders out of doors ami at the age of three mouths i sold them at r
a pound they then averaged  lbs each and the man i sold them to said
they were the finest he ever saw and he wants all i can spare this s-ason

union increases use

  when two groups of telephone
subscribers are joined together the
usefulness of each telephone is
increased

  take the simplest case - two
groups each with three subscribers
as separate groups there are pos-
sible only six combinations-only
six lines of communication unite
these same two groups and instead
of only six there will be fifteen
lines of communication

  no matter how the groups are
located or how they are connected
by exchanges combination in-

creases the usefulness of each tele-
phone it multiplies traffic it
expands trade

  the increase is in accordance
with the mathematical rule if two
groups of a thousand each are
united there will be a million more
lines of communication

  no one subscriber can use all of
these increased possibilities but
each subscriber uses some of them

  many groups of telephone sub-
scribers have been united in thebell
system to increase the usefulness of
each telephone and meet the pub-
lic demand for universal service

american telephone and telegraph company
          and associated companies

           fairy soap	

    the daity bath is worth all the squills and pills
in the world but half its benefit and enjoyment
depends on the purity of the soap used

fairy soap is just as pure as its whiteness would lead
you to believe-because it is made from edible pro-
ducts and has no coloring matter dyes or high
perfumes to deceive the eye or delude the sense
of smell

its floating properties handy oval shape

healthy folks

     can be comfortable in any kind of weather but to be healthy the blood
     must circulate freely from the heels to the top of head no person can keep
     warm and feel good unless it does

     many coffee drinkers shrink from weather a little above or below normal
     coffee has a tendency to congest the liver and more or less weaken the heart
     action which of course interferes seriously with the circulation of the blood
     and a variety of disorders may reasonably be expected to follow

     it seems that a little common sense impels anyone unpleasantly affected by
     coffee to quit it
