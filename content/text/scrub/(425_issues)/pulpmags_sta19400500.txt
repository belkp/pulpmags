 journey in time

by manly wade
wellman

author of twice in time and
other scientifiction tales

to begin with
i defy any-
one to prove
that twice in
time is not
true

 because every
important charac-
ter save one find
him-or her-for
yourself is taken
straight from his-
tory the chief na-
tional and c o m -
munity events dealt
with happened sub-
stantially as here
of the scenes and

manly wade wellman

set forth even most
speeches are authentic

  i will say that youll look hard before you
find the fortress of santi pelagrini on any
map and perhaps the pazzi conspiracy is
credited to another master mind by the text-
books but otherwise things fell out just as
i have them and perhaps my scientific ex-
planations are as believable as any alternates
you can offer

  this is my most pretentious effort at a
time-travel novel to date and i will admit
in advance all the obstacles that bob up in
the path of such a story in fact the first
chapter sets forth the biggest of these the
visualization of a person with three dimen-
sions of space and one of time being a figure
so many feet high so many inches broad and
thick and so many years deep

  if he travels in time he must be two such
figures-he must be twice in time

  but if one can achieve such a journey
where better could he go than to florence
in the quatrecento a city and age perhaps
nowhere else equalled unless in athens of
the golden age

  i have worked hard to make the place live
again and even at that i have barely flicked
the fringes of it

the while light beat upon me with sickening
intensity then i saw figures in a transparent
ghost of a scene chapter i



      he document herewith given
 publication was placed in the
 hands of the editors in 
 whether or not it explains satisfac-
 torily the strange disappearance of
 leo thrasher near florence italy in
 the spring of  we do not pretend
 to decide

   the manuscript came to america in
 the luggage of father david sutton
 an american priest at the time of the
 recent outbreak of war in europe
 father sutton was in rome at the
 time and elected to remain in hope of
 helping war sufferers if his aid should
 be needed but since italy remained
 neutral he sent back most of his lug-
 gage to america by a friend later he
 sent an urgent letter asking that this
 manuscript be examined and pub-
 lished if possible it came father
 sutton said from the strongroom of
 an immemorial theological library in


startling stories

florence and was in the original cas-
ket that had apparently contained it
for a long period of time

  the priests friend brought us both
father suttons letter and the casket
with the manuscript this casket is of
tarnished silver elaborately worked in
the renaissance manner a plate on
the lid bears this legend in italian
french and latin

  let no man open or dispose of this casket
on peril of his soul before the year 

  father suttons new york friends
insist that if he actually wrote the let-
ter and sent the casket they may be
taken at face value if it is a hoax per-
petrated in his name it is both elab-
orate and senseless in any case it is
worth the study of those who love the
curious

  therefore while neither affirming
nor denying the truth of what appears
herewith is given in full the purported
statement of the vanished leo
thrasher

chapter i

the time reflector

this story as unvarnished as i
can make it must begin where
my twentieth-century life ends
-in the sitting room of the suite
taken by george astley and myself at
tomasulos inn on a hill above the
arno it is the clearest of all my cloud-
ed memories of that time april was
the month still chilly for tuscany
and we had a charcoal fire in the grate

  i knelt among my dismantled ma-
chinery before the charcoal fire test-
ing the connections here and there

  so thats your time-traveler
thrasher said astley like the
one h g wells wrote about

  not in the least like the one h g
wells wrote about i said spiritedly
and not perhaps without a certain re-
sentful pride he described a sort of
century-hurdling mechanical horse
in its saddle you rode forward into the
judgment day or back to the begin-

ning this thing of mine will work
but as a reflector

  i peered into the great cylindrical
housing that held my lens a carefully
polished crystal of alum more than
two feet in diameter i smiled with
satisfaction

  it wont carry me into time i as-
sured itll throw me

  he leaned back in the easy chair that
was too small for him

  i dont understand leo he con-
fessed tell me about it

  all right-if i must i said i had
told him so often before it was a
bore to have to repeat what a man
seemed incapable of understanding
the operation is comparable to that
of a burning-glass i explained pa-
tiently which involves a point of
light and transfers its powers through
space to another position here-i
waved toward the mass of mechanism
-is a device that will involve an ob-
ject and transfer or rather reproduce
it to another epoch in time

  ive tried to read einstein at least
enough to think of time as an extra di-
mension ventured astley but
still i dont follow your reasoning
you cant exist in two places at once
thats impossible in the face of it yet
from what i gather you can exist you
have existed in two separate and dis-
tinct times for instance youre a
grown man now but when you were a
baby-

  thats the fourth dimension of it
i broke in the baby leo thrasher
was in a way only the original tip of
the fourth-dimensional me at ten i
was a cross-section now im another
six feet tall eighteen inches wide
eight inches thick-and quite some
more years deep i began to tinker
with my lights do you see now

  a little astley had produced his
oldest and most odorous pipe you
mean that this present manifestation
of you is a single corridorlike object
reaching in time from the place of
your birth-chicago wasnt it-to
here in florence

  thats something of the truth i
granted my head deep in the great
boxlike container that housed the elec-
trical part of the machine i exist
twice in time



therefore only once in time but sup-
pose this me is taken completely out of
twentieth century existence-dema-
terialized recreated in another epoch
that makes twice in time doesnt it

as i had many times before i
thrilled to the possibility it
was my fathers fault all this labor
and dream i had wanted to study art
had wanted to be a painter and he had
wanted me to be an engineer but he
could not direct my imagination at
the schools he selected i found the
wheels and belts and motors all sing-
ing to me a song both weird and com-
pelling the machine age was not
enough of a wonder to me i demand-
ed of it other wonders-miracles

  ive read dunnes theory of corri-
dors in time astley was musing
and once i saw a play about them-
by j b priestly wasnt it whats
your reaction to that stuff

  thats one of the things i hope to
find out about i told him of
course i think that theres only the
one corridor and im going to travel
down it-or duck out at one point i
mean and reenter farther along
what id like to do would be to re-
appear in florence of another age
florence of the renaissance

  astley nodded he preferred the
french gothic period because of the
swords and the ballads but he under-
stood my enthusiasm for renaissance
italy-to me the age and home of the
greatest painters poets philosophers
of all times

  then what he encouraged me
gaining interest

  ill paint a picture-a good one i
hope a picture that will properly
grace a chapel or church or gallery a
picture that will be kept for four cen-
turies or more preferably it will be a
mural that cannot be plundered or de-
stroyed without tearing down a whole
important building when its fin-
ished ill come back to this time to
this hour almost of course ill have
to build myself a new time-reflector
where i am because it will be impos-
sible to take this one with me

  and well go together to the chapel
or church or gallery and look at your

work of art asked astley he
lighted his pipe it will be your foot-
print in the sands of another time
isnt that what you mean

  exactly evidence that ive been
twice in time i sighed with a feel-
ing of rapture because for a moment
i fancied the adventure already ac-
complished if im not able to do a
picture i told him ill make my
mark-initials or a cross cut it in the
plinth of a statue scratch it on the
boards at the back of the mona lisa
or other paintings that i know will
survive it will be almost as good a
proof i smiled however i dare-
say theyll let me paint i have a gift
that way

 perhaps because youre left-
handed astley smiled at me through
the blue smoke but one thing-in
renaissance italy wont your height
and buttery hair be out of place
not among fifteenth-century tus-
cans i said confidently there were
many with yellow hair and blue eyes
look at the old florentine portraits
in any art gallery look at the streets
of florence today not all of those
big tawny people are foreigners

  as i talked i was reassembling my
machinery that we had brought with
great care from my native america to

leo thrasher


startling stories

this spot that i had long since chosen
as the obvious place for my experi-
ment the apparatus took shape under
my hands the open framework six
feet high as many feet long and a
yard wide was of metal rods pains-
takingly milled to micrometric pro-
portion in germany

  at one end on a succession of racks
were arranged my ray-generator with
its light bulbs specially made with
vanadium filaments in america my
cameralike device which concentrated
the time-reflection power had been as-
sembled from parts made by english
german and swiss experts and then
there was the lens of alum with its
housing as big and heavy as a piece
of water-main which i now lifted
carefully and clamped into place at
the front of the camera

astley stared and drew on his
pipe it was plain enough that
he looked tolerantly on all my labor
as well as my talk and that he believed
the whole experiment was something
of which i would quickly tire though
he had been complaisant enough about
coming with me and lending what aid
he could to my secret experiment

  that business youre setting up
there looks like the kind of thing sci-
ence fictionists write about he said

  its exactly the kind of thing they
write about i assured him as a
matter of fact science fiction has
given me plenty of inspiration and
more than a little information while
ive been making it but this is prac-
tical and material astley not imag-
inary

  he had not long to wait to witness
the truth of that though his phleg-
matic nature could never have under-
stood the tenseness that was making
my nerves taut as a spring trap i
knew however that nerve strain was
to be expected for i was nearing the
actuality of the experiment to which
i had long given my heart and soul
i said nothing more because now
within the tick of seconds i would
know whether my dream could be a
reality or if in fact that was all i had
toiled and anguished for-a dream

  i am not sure-how could i be cer-

tain-whether my hands were steady
when the great moment came i know
vaguely that my hands did reach out-
i pressed a switch at the other end
of the framework there sprang into
view a paper-thin sheet of misty vapor
like a piece of fabric stretched be-
tween the rectangle of rods

  i could be excused for the theatric-
ality of my gesture

  behold the curtain i said when
i concentrate my rays upon it all is
ready i need only walk through i
stepped back five minutes for it to
warm up and im off into the past

  i began to take off my clothes fold-
ing them carefully the tweed suit the
necktie of wine-colored silk

  i can be reflected through time i
said with a touch of whimsicality but
my new clothes must stay here and
more seriously i cant count on mol-
ecules to approximate them at the
other end of the business

  you cant count on molecules to
approximate your body either chal-
lenged astley

  i knew that he was not as stolid as
he was trying to appear for his pipe
had gone out and he was filling it
and i could see that his hands shook
a trifle he was beginning to wonder
whether to take me seriously or not
unimaginative astley

  all my diggings into old records at
the biblioteca nazionale yonder in
town have been to find those needed
molecules i told him look at those
notes on the table beside you

  he turned in his big arm-chair-it
was none too big for him at that-and
picked up the jumble of papers that
lay there youve written a date at
the top of this one he said as he
shuffled them  april thirtieth
fourteen-seventy and below it
youve jotted down something i dont
follow mithraic ceremony - rain
prayer-ox on altar

  which sums up everything i said
pulling off my shoes right here-
right at this inn which i hunted up
for the purpose of my experiment-a
group of cultists gathered on april
thirtieth fourteen - seventy just
four hundred and sixty-eight years
ago today i leaned over to look at
twice in time



the time-gauge on my camera im set
for that exactly

  cultists repeated astley whom i
knew from of old is apt to clamp men-
tally upon a single word that inter-
ests him what sort of cultists
contemporaries called them sorcer-
ers and satanists i told him but
probably they had some sort of hand-
me-down paganism from old roman
days something like the worship of
mithras at any rate they were sac-
rificing an ox on that day trying to
bring rain down on their vineyards
i have figured it out like this-if they
needed rain then that particular april
thirtieth must have been bright and
sunny ideal for my reflection appar-
atus they had an ox on the altar and
from its substance i can reassemble
my own tissues to house my person-
ality again the original molecules
have of course dissipated somewhere
along the route of the process in time
is that all clear

astley nodded slowly and i
stood up without a stitch of
clothing a pier-glass gave me back
a tall pink image lank but well mus-
cled crowned with ruffled hair of
tawny gold

  well old man i said with what
nonchalance i could through every
nerve in me was tingling the machin-
erys humming here i step into the
past

  my companion clamped his pipe be-
tween his teeth but did not light it
again i could still see the disbelief
in his eyes

  i hope you know what youre about
and wont do yourself much damage
with that thing he grumbled put-
ting yourself into such a position isnt
like experimenting with rats or guinea
pigs you know

  i havent experimented with rats
or guinea pigs i informed him and
stepped into the open framework

 i turned on another switch and
through the lens of alum flowed an icy-
blue light full of tiny flakes that did
not warm my naked skin

   	charles godfrey leland in his important work
aradia or the gospel of the witches of italy traces
connections between witchcraft and the elder pagan
faiths of rome

  as a matter of fact i said in what
i was sure was a parting message
ive never experimented with any-
thing astley old boy you are about
to see the first operation of my time
reflector upon any living organism
astley leaned forward concern at
last springing out all over his face

  if anything happens he protested
quickly your family-

  i have no family all dead with
a lifted hand i forestalled what else
he was going to say goodbye ast-
ley tomorrow at this time have a
fresh veal carcass or a fat pig brought
here thats for me to materialize my-
self back

  and i stepped two paces forward
into and through the misty veil

  at once i felt a helpless lightness
as though whisked off my feet by a
great wave of the ocean glancing
quickly behind me momentarily i saw
the room and all in it but somehow
vague and transparent-the fading im-
age of the walls the windows my
openwork reflector-apparatus astley
starting to his feet from the armchair
then all vanished into white light

  that white light beat upon me with
an intensity that sickened i tasted
pungency my fibres vibrated to a hum-
ming bruising rhythm there was a

mona lisa


startling stories

moment of hot pain deafening noise
and a glare of blinding radiance

  then peace lassitude something
seemed to materialize as a support un-
der my feet again i saw the trans-
parent ghost of a scene this time full
of human figures that too thick-
ened and i heard many voices chat-
tering excitedly then all was color
life reality

  one voice dominated the others
speaking in resonant italian the
miracle has come

chapter ii
the first half hour

at those words all fell silent and
gazed at me in awe it seemed
unbelievable but all this was happen-
ing to me in the back yard of-yes of
tomasulos tavern it was a changed
back yard though dominated by a
simpler newer building

  i seemed to have trouble with my
memory it lagged as though i had
been stunned and the differences
helped to confuse me here were no
flagstones no clutter of innkeepers
jetsam-only a level stretch of turf
hedged around with some tall close
bushes of greenery and my audience
was grouped below rather than before
me i seemed to be standing high on
a platform or pedestal of cut and mor-
tared stone

  the altar of the ox-sacrificing cult
i had made the journey back through
time from the twentieth century that
just now hung dim and veiled in my
mind like something i had known in
childhood instead of brief seconds
ago

  kneel intoned the same voice that
had hailed me as a miracle

 at once the group before me
dropped humbly down there were a
dozen or so of both sexes and most of
them shabbily dressed the men wore
drab or faded blouses and smocks with
patched hose on their legs and the
women were untidily tricked out in
full skirts bodices and coifs or caps
men and women alike wore long hair

and several were as blond as myself

  i was quite evidently taken for some
strange manifestation of the god or
spirit they worshipped realizing
this i felt that i had an advantage i
sprang lightly down from the altar

  do not be afraid i told them in
my best italian rise up which is
the chief among you

  they came to their feet in a shy
group around me and the tallest of
them moved forward

  i am master of this coven he mur-
mured respectfully but fixing me
with shrewd calculating eyes what
is your will

  first lend me that red cloak of
yours

  he quickly unclasped it from about
his throat i draped it over my naked-
ness and felt more assured before this
mixed audience

 now i continued hark you
all did you worship here because
you sought a miraculous gift from
heaven 

  not from heaven exactly said the
man who had given me his cloak

  he was the best clad of the entire
group wearing plum-colored hose and
a black velvet surcoat that fell to his
knees his narrow waist-he was an
inch taller than i and as gaunt as a
rake-was clasped by a leather belt
with a round silver buckle his sharp
face was decorated by a pointed beard
of foxy red and above this jutted a
fine-cut long nose his eyes so in-
tent upon me were large and deep
the wisest eyes i had ever seen and
his broad brow from which the hair
receded as though beginning to wear
away was high and domed

  there was something about him to
suggest shakespeare-shakespeares
face that is much more alert and en-
igmatic than generally pictured and
set upon the body of ichabod crane
i describe him thus carefully because
of the impression he made upon me
then and because of the importance he
has since had in my life and career

  not from heaven he said again
rather from our father in the low-
est he gestured downward with a
big but graceful hand why do you
ask have you not been sent by him
twice in time



  this was a definite challenge and i
made haste to simulate a grasp of the
situation with an effort i remem-
bered the study i had made of this
very incident the prayer of a sorcer-
ers cult for rain on april  

  i am sent as your friend i an-
nounced this ox which you have
offered-

  i gestured behind me toward the al-
tar then turned to look the stones
were bare save for a slight dark mois-
ture i paused thought quickly and
went on

  this ox which you have offered has
been transmuted into me so that i may

guaracco

be your friend and guest

  there was more truth in that than
my interrogator in the velvet surcoat
thought i told myself triumphantly
but i did not know him yet i also
congratulated myself that there had
been an entire ox for my time reflector
seemed to have left little of it after
the process of reassembling

  as to the rain i finished that
will come doubt it not for i had
seen on the horizon beyond the low-
est stretch of hedge a lifting bank of
cloud

  thank you o messenger breathed
an elderly cultist at my side and

thank you thank you came pray-
erfully from the others

  the lean spokesman bowed a little
but i could discern the hint of a grow-
ing mockery in those deep brilliant
eyes

  your visit is far more than we poor
worshipers had the presumption to
hope for he said silkily will you
suffer these servants of the true be-
lief to depart and will you come
with me to my poor dwelling yonder
i nodded permission and he spoke
briefly in dismissal of the others
they retired through a gap in the
hedge respectfully but without the
awe a miracle might be thought to call
forth i was surprised even a little
piqued then the rationalization came
to me this was the fifteenth cen-
tury and the people were more naive
more credulous they had come to this
strange ceremony in expectation of a
wonder and when it came-even
when there was more than they
hoped for as my volunteer host had
suggested-it did not prostrate them
with emotional amazement i was
strange but i was understandable

  when the last had departed i faced
the gaunt man i have compared his
body to that of ichabod crane but he
was surer of his long limbs than the
schoolmaster of sleepy hollow in-
deed he seemed almost elegant with
his feet planted wide apart and one
big hand bracketed upon his bony hip
how are you called i asked him
my name is guaracco he said
readily the master i say of the
coven which has just done worship
here but if you are truly a messen-
ger from him we delight to serve why
do you not know these things without
my telling

  a sneer was in his voice and i felt
that i had best establish my defenses

  ser guaracco i addressed him
bleakly you will do well to show
courtesy to me i did not come here
to be doubted

  assuredly you did not he agreed
with a sort of triumphant good humor
that yet made me uneasy and now
once more will you come with me into
my home

  he made another of his graceful


startling stories

gestures this time toward the back
door of the stone house that i knew
for tomasulos inn-at least for what
would one day be tomasulos inn i
nodded agreement and we walked to-
gether across the turf to the door

 that thought of mine-for what
would one day be tomasulos inn
 it behooved me to learn a new
procession of thought one that came
two ways to the present i must re-
member not only from the past but
from that future four centuries off

  i clarified the puzzle by calling to
mind a fragment of conversation in
through the looking-glass it read
like this i remembered its a poor
sort of memory that only works back-
wards the white queen had said
that and later sometimes ive be-
lieved as many as ix impossible things
before breakfast i had never before
realized the deep scientific philosophy
of that delightful story meanwhile
it might help clear the fog that hung
so persistently to some chambers of
my mind

  my new acquaintance tapped softly
on the door which opened at once
upon the threshhold stood a tiny male
creature in a dark gownlike garment
he was no larger than a child of nine
and the bright face upturned to us
might have seemed sweet if it had not
reminded me of guaraccos

  is this your son i asked my host

  he laughed quietly

  yes ambassador of the powers be-
low insome degree this is my son

  the little figure stood courteously
aside and let us step into a dark nar-
row corridor guaraccos hand touched
my arm through the folds of the bor-
rowed cloak and i allowed myself to
be guided down the passageway and
into a room beyond

  here were dark decent hangings a
thick carpet chairs a settee and a
table on which lay some bulky and
ancient-looking books a single fat
candle in a bronze sconce illuminated
the room for there was no window
only a barred air-hole at the top gua-
racco invited me to sit down with a
sweep of his hand toward the settee

  i will offer you refreshment he
announced and clapped his hands

  from behind the hangings evi-
dently from a shadowed compartment
beyond darted a figure as small as the
one that had admitted us to the house
but this one was hunched and mis-
shapen with a pinched aged-looking
face set in the loose high collar of its
gown in its long knob-knuckled
hands was held a tray with a silver
flagon and two goblets of blue glass
this tray was set upon the table then
the small figure made a quick exit
without looking back i had been un-
able to judge sex or age in the brief
moment of the small ones presence

guaracco carefully poured red
wine from the flagon

  you do not ask he commented
smoothly if that was another of my
sons

  i made no comment for i could
think of none instead of growing
clear my memory was becoming more
scrambled and it worried me there
was also a definite taste of menace in
the atmosphere guaracco lifted one
of the goblets and held it toward me

 he was as much my son as the
other he said take this wine am-
bassador i daresay you will never
drink another draught like it

  i took the goblet and he lifted the
other

  i give you a toast he said in a
voice that suddenly rang with fierce
mockery sir your immediate trans-
portation to the floor of hell-the very
place from which you lyingly claim to
be sent

  it was too much i rose quickly and
set down the goblet on the table my
left hand with which i am quickest
and handiest doubled into a fist

  ser guaracco i said harshly i
have had enough of your discourtesy
you doubt my being of another world
even though you saw me appear from
the very substance of the ox upon the
altar so-

  enough of that falsehood he in-
terrupted

  quickly but delicately he set his
goblet down beside mine again he
struck his palms together twice

  from the entrance to the passage
darted the pretty little keeper of the
twice in time



doorway from the opening behind
the hangings sprang the withered-
looking bringer of wine each held a
long thin blade curved like a scimitar
and plainly as keen as a razor they
closed quickly in upon me their eyes
glittering cruelly

  guaracco laughed calmly the laugh
of one who makes the final move in a
winning game

  before my familiars cut you into
ounces he said you had best make
confession of your motives
confession i echoed amazed
exactly oh miracles have hap-
pened upon that altar before this-but
it was i guaracco who taxed my brain
and my machine-shop to prepare them
but you come without my knowledge
or leave i do not allow rivals for my
power not even where it concerns
those few foolish witch-worshippers
out with your story impostor and at
once

chapter iii
the service of guaracco

 cannot but be ashamed of the
way i broke down i might have
faced out the surprise i might have
defied the danger together they
overwhelmed me then and there
with guaracco leering at me through
his red beard and the two dwarfs who
no longer seemed like little children
standing with swords ready to slash
me to death i told the truth as briefly
and simply as possible

  guaracco heard me out interrupting
only to ask questions-most intelli-
gent questions when i had made an
end he nodded slowly and sagely

  i know that you will refuse to be-
lieve- i started to sum up but he
interrupted

  but i do believe he assured me
in a tone surprisingly gentle i be-
lieve lad and in part i understand
my understanding will be made per-
fect as we discuss things more fully
he snapped his big fingers at the
dwarfs they lowered their swords
and with a jerk of his head he dis-

missed them through their respective
doors immediately there was less
menace in the atmosphere i felt re-
lieved and thirsty but when i put
out my hand for the goblet guaracco
moved more quickly than i and spilled
the wine out upon the carpet

  that draught was poisoned he in-
formed me i meant to destroy you
as a spy or rival but fill again and
we shall drink to our better under-
standing

  i poured wine and we touched gob-
lets and drank his eyes above the
brim were as knowing as satans own
and for the first time i was sure of
their color-deep violet-blue almost
as dark as ripe grapes

  this is better i said and smiled
but guaracco did not smile back

  do not think he returned in a
level tone of warning that i cannot
kill you later if such a course recom-
mends itself to me those little en-
titites you saw frail though they ap-
pear are half-parcels of fate they
can handle their blades like bravos
they can scale the tallest towers or
wriggle between the closest bars to
deal death at my will the skulls of
their victims destroyed in my service
would pave all the streets of florence
yonder nor-and his voice grew
still colder-are they my only weap-
ons

  he stepped suddenly close so that
his proud lean nose was within an
inch of mine

  in fact your life could have been
taken in two dozen ways between the
yard and here to say nothing of the
poison and the steel i have seen fit to
show you sit down lad and hear my
plans for you

  i sat down with an unheroic show
of acquiescence he felt himself my
master for his teeth flashed in a relish-
ful grin

  hark you i seek power he told
me much power i have already i
wield it through the coven of deluded
witches you have seen and others like
them through my spies and creatures
in the guilds and companies and coun-
cils and through my influence on
many individual persons base and
noble here and elsewhere but i want


startling stories

more power still one day i shall not
fear-his narrow chest expanded a
bit-to give my orders to lorenzo
himself

  lorenzo il magnifico-the magnifi-
cent i murmured he rules in
florence of course

  yes he rules prince in all but the
name-for the nonce his time i dare
predict will be short he strode
across the room hands behind his vel-
vet back then turned and stood over
me hark you man from the future
your world what you tell me of it is
not so strange nor so great as i would
have expected yet you have many sci-
ences and devices to show me ma-
chines organization foreknowledges
of myriad kinds for them i spare
your life you will be yet another of
the chief agents in my service

he told me that with flat assurance
and i did not have the resolution
to question his decision all i could
manage was something about my sur-
prise that a sorcerer would be so in-
terested in honest science

  but sorcerers are scientists he
fairly snapped we offer our learn-
ing to the simple and they gape as
at a miracle of demons for effects
sake we mouth spells and flurry ges-
tures but the miracle is science sane
and practical if i am a sorcerer so
was albertus magnus so was roger
bacon the english monk who gave us
gunpowder well if i escape the
noose or the stake i may be as great
as they greater

  as he spoke i pondered how history
was showing him wise and truthful
magic always foreran science from
alchemys hokus-pokus had risen the
boons of chemistry physics and med-
icine and the quibblings of astrologers
had made astronomy a great and exact
field of scientific study also could
not psychoanalysts look back to the
ancient chaldean magicians who inter-
preted nebuchadnezzars dreams

  but now i was dealing with things
in the future from which i had
stepped things that had happened in
that future again i attempted and
almost achieved the feat of rational-
izing the memory of things to come

if i could do it i felt the clouds
would leave my mind

  this traveling in time that you ac-
complished it is of deep interest to
me guaracco was continuing pacing
back and forth i feel that we may
attempt it again together i would
dearly love to see that world of which
you speak four centuries and more
ahead of us but these things are not
more wonderful than others you men-
tion tell me something about wea-
pons of war

  slowly and vaguely i ventured a
description of the magazine rifle then
of the machine gun my explanations
were faulty and imperfect yet he was
deeply interested and brought forth
tablets and a red-leaded pencil with
which to make sketches

  he drew crudely and i took the
pencil from him to improve his
representations

  by mercurius the god of thieves
you depict things well he praised
me your left hand is surer than my
right perhaps you studied the arts
yes i thought so he squinted at
me knowingly tweaking the point of
his foxy beard i am inspired con-
cerning you

  how is that i asked

  tomorrow we go into the city of
florence he decreed i shall intro-
duce you there as a kinsman of mine
newly from the country who seeks to
enroll in the ancient and honorable
guild of florentine painters i know
a fitting teacher-audreadel verroc-
chio i shall pay his fee to enter you
in his bottega as a student

  i am to serve you there

  serve me there or through there in
other places verrocchio is well known
and well liked lorenzo and the other
great nobles patronize him i have
not yet a proper agent among the arts
you will suit nicely in that position
again i agreed because there was
nothing else to do he chuckled in
triumph and actually patted my shoul-
red saying that we would get along
famously as adopted cousins then he
led me to another room in which were
a bed and a cupboard

  you will rest here tonight he in-
formed me here-he opened the
twice in time



cupboard-may be some clothing that
will furnish you we are of a height
you and i and not too dissimilar in
girth

despite guaraccos confidence
in this last matter his hose
stretched drum-tight upon my more
muscular legs and his doublet proved
too narrow in shoulder and hip

  we shall have that altered he de-
cided and going to the door raised his
voice lisa

  my lord replied a soft apprehen-
sive voice from another room

  come here at once child and bring
your sewing tackle he turned back
to me you shall now see my greatest
treasure ser-leo i think you called
yourself that is the name of the
lion and it matches well with that
tawny mane of yours

  into the doorway stepped a girl

  in her way she was nearly as im-
pressive to me as guaracco had been
not tall of a full but fine figure and
as graceful as a dancer she paused on
the threshhold as though timid at sight
of a stranger her face was finely
oval with large soft eyes of midnight
blue and a shy close-held little mouth
that was so darkly red as to be purple
these spots of color glowed the more
vividly because of the smooth ivory
pallor of her skin

  her hair was thick and sooty black
combed neatly straight under a coif
as snug as a helmet she wore a
chemise of sober brown with a black
bodice over it and a black woollen
skirt so full and long as to hide her
feet

  in her thin steady hands she held
a flat iron box the sewing kit guarac-
co had commanded

  have i described a beautiful wom-
an

  she was that and nobly modest as
well and so i call her impressive

  lisa i present to you ser leo a
new servant of my will said guarac-
co to her he is to be of value to me
therefore be courteous to him begin
by altering this doublet to his meas-
ure rip the seams here and here and
sew them again in a fuller manner

  he turned to address me

  ser leo this girl lisa is for you a
model of obedience and single-hearted
helpfulness he raked her with his
eyes not contemptuously but with a
dispassionate pride as though she
were a fine piece of furniture i
bought her my friend of her beggarly
parents eighteen years gone she was
no more than six months old i have
been father and mother and teacher to
her she has known no other lord than 
myself no other motive than mine

  the girl bowed her head as if to 
hide her confusion at being thus lec-
tured upon and busied herself with -
scissors and needle i pulled guarac-
cos red cloak around my naked shoul-
ders my self-appointed master smiled
a trifle

  that flaming mantle becomes you 
well take it as a present from me
but to return to lisa-i trust her as 
i trust few she and the two imps you
have seen are the closest to me of my
unorthodox household she cooks for
me sews for me keeps this house for
me i in turn shelter and instruct
her some day if it will profit me
greatly i may let her go to a new mas-
ter-some great lord who will thank
me for a handsome submissive pres-
ent she will cherish that great lord
and learn his secrets for me is that
not so lisa

  she bowed her head the lower and
the ivory of her cheeks showed pink
like the sky at the first touch of morn-
ing i shared her embarrassment but
guarracco chuckled quietly and
poured himself a half-goblet of wine
this he drank slowly without inviting
me to join him

  in a surprisingly short time lisa
had finished broadening the doublet
for me and it fitted my torso like wax
guaracco was moved to another of his
suave compliments on the appearance
i made

as evening was drawing near the
three of us took a meal it was
served in the hedged yard where gua-
raccos dupes had prayed to infernal
powers for rain whether by prayer
or by coincidence the rain did arrive
not long after we had finished the
bread chicken and salad that lisa set


startling stories

before us as the first drops fell we
went indoors and took wine and fresh
peaches and honey by way of dessert
in a great front room that was luxuri-
ously furnished with gilded couches
tables and tapestries

  after the supper guaracco con-
ducted me to his workshop a great
flag-floored cellar

  here was a bench with lamps re-
torts and labeled flasks for experimen-
tation in chemistry and in this branch
of science i was to find my host-or
captor-amazingly learned

  the greater part of the space how-
ever was filled with tools and odds
and ends of machinery both of wood
and metal

  at guaraccos command i busied
myself among these but my strange
memory-fault - i was beginning to
think of it as partial amnesia-came to
muddle me again i could make only
the most slovenly demonstrations and
when i sought to explain i found my-
self failing wretchedly

  you cannot be blamed for these
vaguenesses guaracco said almost
comfortingly a drop backward
through time four hundred years and
more must of necessity shock ones
sensibility the most delicate tissues
are naturally in the brain

  i hope to recover my faculties
later i apologized just now i pro-
gress in generalities only

  even so you are better grounded
in these things than any man of this
present age he encouraged me
your talk of that astounding power
electricity amazes me perhaps
things can be harnessed with it
steam too i think i can see in my
minds eye how it can be put to work
like wind in a sail or water flowing
over a mill-wheel his eyes bright-
ened suddenly wait ser leo i
have an inspiration

  inspiration i echoed

  i watched while he opened a small
casket on the bench and fetched out a
little purselike bag of dark velvet
from this he tumbled a great rosy
pearl the size of a hazelnut and glow-
ing as with its own light upon his
palm he caught it and thrust it under
my nose

  look he commanded and i
looked

  to be sure it must be a valuable
jewel to be as full of rose-and-silver
radiance as a sunset sky it captivated
my soul with the sudden impact of its
beauty

  look repeated guaracco and i
gazed as though my eyes were bound
in their focus the pearl grew bigger
brighter

  look he said yet again as from
a distance and though i suspected at
last his motive i could not take my
eyes away

  the light faded consciousness
dropped slackly from me like a gar-
ment i knew a black silence as of
deep sleep then a return to blurred
awareness i shook myself and
yawned

  a chuckle sounded near by and i
opened my drowsy eyes to find guarac-
cos foxy face close to mine

ou are awake now he asked
with a false gentleness

  howlong did i sleep i asked but
he did not reply

  he polished the pearl upon his
sleeve and slid it carefully into its
velvet bag

   i think that some if not all of the
forgotten things are buried in your
mind he observed with you i tried
a certain way that fools call black
magic

  hypnotism that was it guaracco
had hypnotized me had he in real-
ity found in my sub-conscious mind
those technical matters that i seemed
to have almost forgotten

  every minute of your company
he was continuing convinces me that
i did well to spare your life and enlist
you in my service now draw for me
again

  i obeyed and he watched once
again he praised me and swore that i
should be placed as a student with
andrea verrocchio it had grown
late by now and he escorted me to my
bed chamber bidding me goodnight in
most cordial terms

  but when the door closed behind
him i heard the key turn in the heavy
bronze lock

chapter iv
apprenticeship

on the following day fell the tor-
rents of rain that had been
prayed for in such occult fashion and
the trip to florence was postponed
to my chagrin my memories of vari-
ous details that had been so clear dur-
ing my twentieth century existence
were even cloudier so much more so
that i spent the morning making notes
of what little i remembered

  these notes guaracco appropriated
with as cordial a speech of thanks as
though i had done them expressly for
him i might have protested but near
at hand loitered the uglier of his two
dwarfs and there might have been
even a greater danger at the window
behind me or hidden among the tapes-
try folds at my elbow

  so i gave over writing and went to
talk to lisa the sober but lovely young
girl to whom he had introduced me the
night before i found her still shyly
friendly possessed of unfailing good
manners and charm she had needle-
work to do and i sat talking and lis-
tening fascinated by the play of her
deft white fingers while we were to-
gether i at least felt less the sense
of being a prisoner and an underling

  but the rain had ceased by sunset
and early the next morning guaracco
knocked at my door to call out that
we would go to florence immediately
after breakfast we ate quickly and
went out into the fine early sunlight
servants-guaracco had several in a
nearby cottage peculiar fellows but
deeply devoted to him - brought
around horses a fine white stallion for
guaracco and an ordinary bay for me
i mounted being glad that i had not
forgotten how to ride and we can-
tered off along a clay-hardened high-
way with a groom on a patient mule
behind us

  we had not far to ride to florence
i found the valley of the amo much
the same as i had known it in my for-

the pearl grew bigger and consciousness
dropped from me like a garment chapter iii


startling stories

raer existence green and bounded by
hills sprinkled with villas clusters of
peasant huts and suburbs with the
town in the middle

  florence itself was smaller newer
more beautiful the town lay secure
with high battlemented walls of stone
with the river running through i saw
the swell of the duomo second ca-
thedral of all christendom great and
round and pale like the moon de-
scended to earth and around it the
towers of many white houses and pal-
aces and cool green of garden trees

  the gate we entered was perhaps
twenty-five feet wide by fifteen high
and the tall lintel of gray-brown stone
bore a bas-relief of st marks lion
complete with wings and book also
several female figures which appeared
to have tails

  within the walls the town i had
known as grubbily ancient in the
twentieth century all shone new and
fresh by the clean whiteness of the
houses and by their style of architec-
ture i judged that all or nearly all
of the older florence had been razed
to allow this new renaissance capital
of the medici its full glory

  the streets were for the most part
smoothly paved or at least had good
gutters and cobbles some of them
the side ways were too narrow even
for one-way traffic and darkly close
with the upper stories of the houses
projecting in many places these up-
per stories jutted out so far as to make
a covered way for pedestrians at either
side here and there stood the en-
closed mansions and gardens of nobles
or wealthy merchants and at many
crossings were wide squares with oc-
casionally the statue of a saint or a
hero

  many folk were afoot or on horse-
back though there were few wains
and these of the most primitive most
of the transport was done by donkey
pannier or in baskets on the brawny
shoulders of porters the people
seemed prosperous and in most cases
happy later i was to be reminded
that the florentines then enjoyed a
unique freedom and were wont to
boast about it to less favored milanese
or venetians

at last at guaraccos signal we
reined our animals before a tall
barnlike structure of drab stone front-
ing away from the brink of the green
arno it was several stories high
pierced with many barred windows
and furnished with a double door of
iron grillwork

  this is verrocchios bottega said
my guide and we dismounted leaving
our bridle-ends in the hands of the si-
lent groom

  i moved toward the door but gua-
raccos big hand touched my elbow i
turned inquiringly

  before you enter here i have a
thought to burn into you he said in
a cold hushed voice

  with his deep penetrating eyes his
red beard and suddenly sinister face
he might have sat for a traditional por-
trait of judas i knew more fiercely
than ever a dislike and distrust of
him

  you wish to exact a vow of fealty
from me i suggested vows begin
ser guaracco only when hope is
dead

  he shook his head and under his
beard his mouth wriggled like a snake
in singed grass

  no he replied i exact no vow
i say simply that if you betray me in
word or deed if you seek ever to hurt
or to hinder me-if in short you do
not adhere to the service i have set
you i will see that you die by the foul-
est death ever invented

  i am not afraid of you i said to
him striving in my heart to make this
the truth

  nor do i seek your fear was his
quick rejoinder only your under-
standing shall we go in

  the great front room of the acad-
emy was as large as a riding hall with
lofty musty beams on the ceiling and
whitewashed walls not as much light
as one might wish to paint by but with
the windows all set toward clear open
ground the corners of the room were
cluttered with art materials plaster
molds half-finished paintings on
planks broken chairs pots of paint
sheafs of brushes and rolled parch-
ments and canvases

  three or four young men in shabby
twice in time



smocks stopped their various tasks to
gaze curiously at me-students i sup-
posed them to be and from behind a
counterlike bench at the door a man
greeted guaracco

  good-morrow ser andrea said
my patron i said once that i would
watch out for a likely pupil for you
here is one-my own cousin leo
the master of the bottega came from
behind his bench he was a spidery
little fellow of forty or thereabouts
clad in a long gown of dark wool like
a priests with ill-fitting worn slip-
pers on his flat feet his face was
beardless white and puffy and he
wore spectacles low upon his snub
nose his hair already gray had be-
gun to grow thin on top his finest
features were his big wise eyes and
his slender delicate hands

  guaracco praised me highly and
finally produced my drawings an-
drea verrocchio carried them into the
light and looked at them narrowly
with pursed lips finally he turned
his spectacles upon me

you draw well boy he com-
mented drawing is the father of all
the arts would you learn to paint
i told him quite truthfully that it
was my ambition

  if you study with me he admon-
ished you must work entirely as i
devise

  to devise is the work of the mas-
ter i said respectfully to execute
is the work of the apprentice

  well worded he nodded and
smiled a trifle come here-look at

he beckoned us across the room
against the rear wall hung a
sizeable sheet of wood held in place
on a sort of scaffold with cords and
pins upon this had been painted but
not finished an oil of the baptism of
jesus some of the figures were ex-
ecuted with spirit and intelligence
but over one of them a kneeling angel
i could not but shake my head

  you see the fault murmured an-
drea verrocchio beside me the dra-

   	this is the accepted description of andrea ver-
rocchio who was not only a painter and sculptor high
in favor at court but the teacher of some of the most
distinguished artists and craftsmen of his time

peries ser leo are not properly
done

  they are not sir i agreed after
a careful examination

  he smiled slowly the students
too had gathered with us i had a
sense of their critical suspicion per-
haps they had worked at the thing and
failed

  peradventure boy you can better
it suggested verrocchio in a tone
that was full of superior doubt

  may i use these paints i in-
quired stooping to some pots and
brushes at the foot of the framework

  as i did so i caught a glimpse of
guaraccos face set in an easy smile
for all his strange menacing nature
he at least trusted my skill

  drapery is a science worth close
study i lectured the group as i
mixed some colors upon a rectangular
palette board the part of the fold
which is furthest from the ends where
it is confined-i pointed with my
brush to the fringe of the angels robe
-will return most closely to its orig-
inal extended condition

  one of the students snickered at
my words

  show us what you mean by these
words verrocchio said

  with your leave i shall try to i
accepted his challenge and began to
dash on my paint here was another
old skill that i had not lost every-
thing naturally desires to remain in its
own state i elaborated drapery
desires to lie flat if it is caught into
folds or pleats thus-and i executed
a crumpled crease upon the knee of the
angel-it is forced to quit this con-
dition of flatness and obeys the law of
this force in that part where it is most
constrained

  i progressed to the hem

  the part furthest away from such
constraint i went on you will find
returns most nearly to its original
state-that is to say lying extended
and full

  you say truth ser leo and you
paint truth too verrocchio com-
mended warmly and turned quickly
to guaracco your kinsman stays
here as my pupil and helper go for-
ward with that drapery young sir


startling stories

when you are finished the picture can
have no further improvement 

  i worked away caring little for the
jealous staring of my fellow students
meanwhile guaraccos groom brought
in a bundle of clothing for me and
guaracco himself gave me a bag of
clinking coins

  i have paid the charge for your ed-
ucation cousin he said to me stay
here live and work here and do me
credit do not forget what i require
from you according to your recent
conversations i shall keep an eye and
ear upon you i may even take a house
to be near you again i say do not
forget

  and with this equivocal farewell he
strolled out the very picture of a kind-
ly and helpful kinsman

  so i became a pupil of andrea ver-
rocchio the finest teacher of arts in
florence i made the acquaintance of
my fellow students and found them
not at all bad fellows some indeed
quite adept at their work i had a
cell-like room with pallet bed and ta-
ble and chest of art materials i lis-
tened dutifully to the precepts of our
instructor and under his tutelage did
many kinds of work

verrocchios aptitude and
taste was for sculpture and
though i thought this less intellectual
than painting for it cannot represent
the transparent or yielding things i
did not rebel

  my first piece of finished work a
gold ornament for the king of portu-
gal was called splendid by verroc-
chio he let me help him with the
great bronze busts he was fashioning
for the palace of the medici and let
me do alone a series of ornamental
shields of painted wood for a wealthy
merchant

  in the evenings and sometimes in
the daytime when work was slack i
was permitted to go with my fellow
students through the streets i could
never weary myself with the sights
and sounds and smells of florence

  i loved the pageantry of the main

   	a painting that fits this description and that
might be the same exists today in florence it is cer-
tain that the draperies of the kneeling angel are done
more skilfully than those of the other figures

thoroughfares-laden beasts proces-
sions of armed men going from one
sentry post to another occasional rich
coaches of the great or wealthy cava-
liers on prancing horses veiled ladies
in mule-litters rougher but still pic-
turesque guildsmen artisans beggars
burghers an occasional captain of
mercenaries a condottiero slashed
and swaggering his long swordsheath
hoisting up the hem of his mantel
criers loudly acclaiming their wares
of fruit fish wine or what-not

  on the poorer narrower streets
there were hucksters and small trades-
men with baskets and trays bevies of
bright-eyed girls on the lookout for
romantic adventure there were
palaces to see in the wider spaces and
the great sculptured bridges across the
arno too there were pleasant cheap
taverns where young men might get
good wine and plenty for copper coins

  so it went for the month of may
twice during that time guaracco
called to talk to me in honeyed pro-
testations of concern over the welfare
of his supposed cousin but between
the pleasant lines of his conversation
my inner ear could distinguish the
warning and insistence of his power
over me

  once he remarked that lisa-you
remember our little lisa-had sent
me her warm regards i found myself
heartily grateful for that brief mes-
sage from one who had treated me
fairly and kindly

  the first of june dawned bright and
sultry hot i was up betimes putting
the last touches to an improvement on
the scaffolding which served verroc-
chio as an easel for extra large pic-
tures i fitted its cords to pulleys and
winches so that the artist instead of
moving from one place to another
could hold a certain position with ad-
vantageous lights and viewpoints
while he lowered the picture itself or
lifted it or moved it from side to side
at his will

  in the midst of my work a boy came
in from the street he approached
and said very softly that he had a
message

  a message i demanded turning
for whom
twice in time



  the little fellow bowed for you
ser leo i am ordered to conduct
you to a place in the next street
how do you know my name i
asked and looked sharply at him
then i saw that it was no boy but the
dwarf who had once opened guarac-
cos door to me and whom i had then
mistaken for a handsome child

 come he persisted you are
awaited

  turning from my work i asked ver-
rocchio if i might be excused for a few
moments he glanced up from the
bench where he and two other students
were studying the plans of a chapel
and nodded his permission

 is it guaracco who waits to see
me i asked the dwarf as we emerged
from the bottega into the sticky sun-
light but he smiled mysteriously and
shook his little head

wt walked along the street my
ww guide trotting in front and
turned a corner

  there at the brink of the river was
a small dwelling house surrounded by
a green garden

  go in ser leo the dwarf bade me
and ran around to the back with the
nimble suddenness of a dog

  left alone i knocked at the door
there was no answer and i pushed
down the latch and went in

  i found myself in a cool dark hall

paneled in wood on a leather-cush-
ioned sofa sat lisa the ward of guar-
acco her feet were pressed close to-
gether under the hem of her wide
skirt and her hands were clasped in
her lap about her whole attitude
there was an air of tense embarrassed
expectancy she looked up as i came
in and then quickly dropped her gaze
making no answer to my surprised
greeting

  as i came farther into the room ap-
proaching the girl a pale oblong
caught my eye-a folded paper lying
on a little round center table upon
it were written three large letters
leo

  is this for me i asked lisa who
only bowed her head the lower i be-
gan to catch something of her embar-
rassment your pardon for a mo-
ment i requested and opened the
paper

 the letter was brief and to the
point it read

my dear adopted kinsman

  you have thus far pleased me much and
i have high hopes of great advantage from
your acquaintance and endeavor it occurs
to me to make you a present

chapter v
the gift of guaracco

the first sentence of the letter as-
tonished me beyond measure the
last had two effects overwhelming and
sudden in succession like the two re-
ports of a great double barreled gun

  for my primary impulse was to re-
joice to be glad and thankful why
had i never realized that i loved lisa
thinking of her now-how could i
help but love her but my second re-
action was one of horrified knowledge
of what guaracco meant by such a gift

  lisa fair mistress i said this
letter-you know what it says 

  she nodded and the living rose
touched her ivory skin

it cannot be i told her soberly

  cannot she repeated no louder
than a sigh it might have been a pro-
test it might have been an agreement

  i overcame an impulse to fall on one
knee before her like any melodramatic
courtier of that unrestrained age and
land

  lisa i said again desperately
choosing my words first of all let me
say that i am deeply moved by the
mere thought of winning you gua-
racco appears to mean what he says
and you appear to be ready to con-
sent watching her i saw the trem-
bling of her lips but i cannot take
you at his hands lisa

at last she looked me full in the
face she too began to comprehend

  that subtle wizaivd guaracco i
went on growing warrn to the outrage
he would wreak tries to rule us both
by fear he sees that he is not suc-
cessful we yield slowly biding our
time for orders are orders until there
comes strength for disobedience and
so he seeks to rule us by happiness
confess it lisa for a moment you
too would have wanted love between
us

  she gave me her sweet little smile
with unparted lips but shyness had
covered her again and she did not an-
swer me

we cannot lisa i said earnestly

it might be sweet and for me at least
it would be the easiest course in the
world but guaraccos touch upon
our love-heaven forefend that we be
obligated to him

  eloquently said leo my kins-
man 

  it was the voice of guaracco i
spun quickly around ready to strike
out at him but he was not there only
his laughter like the whinnying of a
very cunning and wicked horse was
there coming from the empty air of
the room

  do not strive against nothingness
young hero his words admonished
me out of nowhere and do not an-
guish me by spurning my poor ten-
der ward she loves you leo and you
have just shown that you love her

  such words made it impossible for
me to look at lisa and therefore i
looked the harder for guaracco in
the midst of his mockery i located the
direction of the sound he spoke from
the rooms very center and i moved
in that direction

  at once he fell silent but i had
come to a pause at the point where the
final syllable still echoed almost in
my ear i glared around me down
and upward

  a cluster of lamps hung just above
my head held by several twisted cords
to the ceiling among the cupped
sconces i spied what i suspected-a
little open cone of metal like a fun-
nel i am afraid that i swore aloud
even in lisas presence when i saw
and knew the fashion of guaraccos
ghostly speaking but i also acted
with a single lunge and grasp i was
upon the lamps and pulled with all my
strength

they came away and fell crash-
ing but not they alone for with
them came a copper tube that had been
suspended from cords and concealed
there i tore it from its place in the
ceiling beyond that ceiling i knew
went another tube that went to the
lips of guaracco in hiding i cast the
double handful of lamps upon the
planks of the floor

  once again guaracco laughed but
this time from behind me in the room
twice in time



itself again i turned a panel of
the woodwork had swung outward
and the man himself stepped through
all black velvet and flaming beard and
sneering smile

  you are a quick one he remarked
i have fooled many a wise old grand-
father with that trick

  i gathered myself to spring

 now nay leo he warned me
quickly do nothing violent noth-
ing that you would not have set down
as your last act on earth his hand
lifted and in it was leveled a pistol
massively but knowingly made i
stared for a moment forgetting my
rage and protest at his villainous
matchmaking surely pistols were not
invented so early   

  it is of my own manufacture he
informed me as though he read my
mind though short it throws a ball
as hard and as deep as the longest ar-
quebus in christendom do not force
me to shoot you kinsman his lips
writhed scornfully over the irony of
our pretended relationship

  shoot if you will i bade him i
have said to lisa and i also say to
you that i shall not be led by love into
your deeper hateful service

  he shook his rufous head with a
great show of melancholy

  alas young cousin you do great
and undeserved wrong to lisa and to
me only this morning she was dis-
posed to thank me for the thought to
scan by way of rehearsal the marriage
service    ah i have it he
laughed aloud you do not think
that a poor art student like yourself
can support a wife and household
he held out his free hand as warmly
smiling as any indulgent father take
no further thought of it i myself
shall provide a suitable dowry for the
bride

  even poor wretched lisa exclaimed
in disgust at his evil humor and i
started forward suddenly coming so
close to guaracco that i found the
hard muzzle of his pistol digging into
the pit of my stomach

  back he commanded with quiet
menace back i say at once   
that is better what fantastic objec-
tion have you to raise this time

  you add money to beauty and love
in the effort to buy me i cried in
new disgust dowry a bribe to
marriage oh you are infamous
surely we are living in the last days
of the world i flung wide my arms
as though in invitation of a shot kill
me guarracco you said once that
you would kill me if i disobeyed you
well i disobey and with my last
breath i do name you a sorry scoun-
drel

  he shook his head and moved back

  no he demurred gently per-
haps after all the fault was mine i
was too abrupt for your dainty na-
ture leo he turned his eyes but
not his head toward the unhappy lisa
where she sat in mute and woeful con-
fusion forgive this ungallant fel-
low my child perhaps another
time-

  there shall be no other time i
said flatly i refuse once and for
all

  then go guaracco bade me and
he simulated a bored yawn you have
disappointed me and shamed lisa re-
turn to your labors among the arts and
when your heart is cooler we shall talk
again go

i went and my nature was more
fiery hot than the waxing sun over-
head

  guaracco had spoken this much
truth i had brought shame to lisa
apparently she had been ready to ac-
cept me as a mate and whether this
was at guaraccos hypnotic suggestion
or not made little difference in the way
my reaction must have affected her
she had come to meet me hoping to
hear my praises and pledges to stand
with me before a priest

  undoubtedly she understood my re-
fusal to be her lover but could i not
have been more kindly toward her
could i not have said parenthetically
that it was in reality guaracco i re-
fused and that on some happier occa-
sion-like many a man leaving a
stormy scene i was aware of fully a
score of things i should have said and
done

  i was also aware that i loved lisa
no getting away from that even when


startling stories

i tried to say that it was all guarac-
cos adroit suggestion that he may
have hypnotized me as well as lisa
from the first day he had introduced
us to each other

  conjectures about it were only the
more disturbing finally i gave up
the struggle against my new realiza-
tion i loved lisa and probably i had
lost her there was nothing i could
do about it i told myself as i drew
near to the bottega turned my foot-
steps to enter at the door

  a final glow of rage swelled all
through me i yearned wildly for an
opportunity to catch guaracco off
guard to strike and throttle him a
mood rare in me made my heart and
body thirst for violent action

  as fate would have it violent ac-
tion was about to be provided for my
needs

  a horseman came cantering along
the street his horse a handsome
gray spurned a loose stone from its
place among the cobbles another mo-
ment and the beast had stumbled and
fallen throwing its rider headlong

  a crowd of strolling pedestrians
within view of the mishap all hurried
close myself among them my hand
went out to lift the sprawling man
but with a grunt and an oath he had
scrambled to his feet and was tugging
at the bridle of his horse it would
not rise

   the beast is hurt i suggested

  not this devil-begotten nag
growled the rider he dragged on the
bridle again then kicked the animals
gray ribs with his sharp-toed boot

  harshness to animals has never
pleased me and as i have said my an-
ger was ready to rise at anything i
shouted in immediate and strong pro-
test the man turned upon me he
was tall and sturdy with a forked
black beard and two square front teeth
showing under a short upper lip he
wore a long sword under his cloak of
brown silk and had the look of a tough
customer

  do not meddle between me and my
horseflesh he snapped and once more
heaved at the bridle

  the injured horse struggled up at
last driving the little crowd back on

all sides and the master laughed
shortly

   did i not say he was unhurt belly
of bacchus it was his careless foot
that threw us-curse it and him

  he clutched the bit of the poor
beast and struck it across the face
withhis riding whip

   stop that i shouted and caught
his arm he tried to pull loose but i
was as strong as he a moment later
he had released the horse which a
passerby seized by the reins and cut
at me with the whip my left hand
lashed out as quick as impulse it
smote solidly on those two front
teeth and the man-at-arms staggered
back with a roar

   i would have struck again perhaps
stretching him on the cobbles had not
andrea verrocchio himself running
from his door thrown his arms around
me meanwhile the black-bearded
man had whipped out his sword and
swearing in a blood-curdling manner
was struggling to throw off two vol-
uble peacemakers and get at me

   have you gone mad boy verroc-
chio panted in my ear that is gido

ace guard

swords beside the river

hen i say that i did not flinch
at verrocchios warning i do
not call myself brave-only possessed
by a white heat of anger for a mo-
ment i made as if to rush fairly upon
the point of gidos sword but a sav-
ing ounce of wit returned to me

   my eye caught a gleam at the hip of
one of the growing throng of watch-
ers i made a long leaping stride at
the fellow and before he knew i was
there i had clutched and plucked away
his long straight blade

   thank you friend i said to him
hastily i will return this steel when
i have settled accounts with ser gido

gido was roaring like a profane bull

name and some that smacked of the
classic greek and roman but by now
i had recovered my own self-posses-
sion enough to make me recognize my
danger and face it i thrust away ver-
rocchios pleading hands and inter-
rupted gido in the middle of a sul-
phurous rodomontade

  you talk too loudly for a fighting
man i told him come i am no
wretched horse or weaponless
burgher let him go you good peo-
ple he needs blood-letting to ease his
hot temper

 there shall be blood-letting
enough and to spare the palace
guardsman promised me balefully

  verrocchio pleaded that there be no

brawl outside his house but gido
loudly claimed that there must be a
back courtyard where we could have
qtiiet for our work and with the
crowd clamoring and pushing after us
to that back courtyard we went
through a little gate at the side of the
bottega

  there was a level space flagged with
stones at the grassy brink of the arno
all the spectators jammed close to the
walls of the house and its paling at
the sides while my adversary and my-
self stood free near the water

  gido gave me a quick businesslike
scrutiny that had something in it of
relish-the sort of gaze that a carver
might bestow upon a roast with a


startling stories

quick flirt of his left arm he wound
his brown cloak around his elbow to
serve as buckler

  i will teach you to defy your bet-
ters master paint-smearer he prom-
ised

  teach on i urged him i may
be a good enough pupil to outshine my
teacher

  all this time i was telling myself to
be calm ruthless and wide-awake and
that i must not fear the raw point i
had done some fencing in prep school
and at my university and it was
another thing that i remembered
fairly well with my hand if not my
head i felt that i had a certain ad-
vantage too in being left-handed

 we moved toward each other by
common consent gingerly taking the
stylized paper-doll pose of fencers as
my left hand advanced my sword gido
saw that he would have trouble shield-
ing himself with that wadded cloak

  fortune favors the right he mut-
tered and his square front teeth
gleamed with pleasure at his own pun

  for answer i made a quick simple
attack it was no more than a feeling
thrust and he swept it aside with an
easy shifting of his straight blade at
once i made a recovery ready to parry
his riposte

  the riposte did not come instead
this crack swordsman of the medici
tried to beat down my weapon and so
clear the way for a stab at my breast
i yielded a little before his pressure
disengaged parried in turn and
dropped back another of his slash-
ing assaults i only half-broke with my
edge and felt the delicate sting of his
edge upon my left forearm

  first blood yelled one of the
watchers and a little cheer went up
for my enemy the florentines were
enjoying the sport

but i was not injured so far as my
activity was concerned as gido
rushed to follow his advantage i was
able to parry cleanly immediately
while he was yet extended in his for-
ward lunge and well within reach i
sped my riposte it caught him un-
prepared and he barely flung up his
cloak-swaddled left arm in time

through half a dozen thicknesses of
brown cloth my edge bit its way and
gido swore as his blood sprang out to
dye the fabric a deep red

  he who bleeds last bleeds longest
i paraphrased and made a sweeping
slash on my own account

  gido had to spring all the way back
to escape and upon his face had
dawned an expression of perplexed
concern

  was this the best swordsman that
the medici could send against a raw
student of the arts i felt a little per-
plexity on my own account gido had
the look and with verrocchio at least
the reputation of a seasoned fighter
yet he was doing no more than enough
to hold his own against my sword he
had missed a chance to riposte at my
first attack a moment later he had been
foolishly open to my own riposte

  as our blades grated together again
i found the answer in my own semi-
obscured memory riposte that was
it-or rather the lack of riposte the
movement the counter-attack made
when your opponents thrust has been
parried and he has not yet recovered
is in great measure instinctive but
in these renaissance times it was not
rationalized was not yet made a defi-
nite pseudo-reflex of sword-play i
knowing the formal science of it had
a great advantage i could win by it

  fight you knave i taunted gido
as my steel pressed against his ill
cut you into flitches like a pig

  again he thrust wildly in his angry
terror and again i warded and with
a quick straightening of my arm i
touched him before he could recover
my point snagged his bearded cheek
and a thread of gore showed this
time the onlookers cheered for me

  gido retreated once more two paces
this time his face frankly showed
terror

  he is a devil he choked out he
knows a secret thrust unfair

  i will show you my secret drive it
to your heart i growled back press-
ing forward after him fight man
or i will butcher you

  he tried for a moment to oppose

 	no scientific treatment of the riposte in sword-

 silay is to be found in any manual of the exercise be-
 ore the late seventeenth century
twice in time



me then fled again from my menacing
point now that his nerve was gone
he could barely hold up his sword

  i cannot stand against you he
mumbled wretchedly

  show him mercy called verroc-
chio to me and i half lowered my
weapon

  gido saw and struck only a quick
recovery of my guard saved my life
i roared wordlessly and sprang upon
him my first sweeping slash he par-
ried the second almost cut away his
left arm he staggered back and tried
unsuccessfully to hold off my long
point thrust but i got home deep be-
tween his ribs pulling away he ran
like a boy caught stealing fruit and
i after him

  he gained the gate that led to the
street leaning for a moment upon it
half a dozen of the onlookers rushed
to bar my way pleading that i was
already the winner but my rage was
up again i struggled through their
arms and after gido

  he had gone through the gate fallen
through it as i came into the street
with the throng at my heels i almost
trod upon my adversary he lay
sprawled across the curb and into the
gutter his sword under him blood
pushing from his mouth and drench-
ing his black beard he had only life
enough to grope in his pierced bosom
pull forth a crucifix of silver and try
to kiss it

the fight and the fury went out of
me as i watched him die for it was
the first violent death i had ever wit-
nessed i looked around at the star-
ing scared faces and saw among them
that of the man whose sword i had
snatched

  take back your weapon i said
to him but he drew fearfully away
from me

  hoofs were thundering on the cob-
blestones the knot of people pressed
back to the front of the bottega and
let a little cloud of horsemen ap-
proach a voice shouted command-
ingly and there was a quick orderly
dismounting one of the armored
men stopped to gaze at the body

  gido he grunted and slain

  what demanded a voice from be-
hind gido you say who slew
him

  two men richly dressed had re-
mained upon their superb horses one
of them reined in almost above me
he was a handsome dark youngster
no older than i with abundant curls
descending from under his plumed
velvet coat to the shoulders of his
plum-colored houppelande or gown-
like outer garment his belt gloves
and boots were embroidered with
massy gold he stared at the body of
gido at me and at the bloody sword i
still held

  it was the other sitting his steed
just beyond who had spoken he was
also young tall and rugged with
harpies blazoned richly upon the
breast of his surcoat his strong face
framed between sweeps of straight
black hair had broad fiercely ugly
features above the right corner of
his mouth grew a wart to me his ap-
pearance suggested something of my
former life-a painting or statue

  gido he said again my own
peerless gido-slain

  here upon me had ridden lorenzo
the magnificent absolute ruler of the
city of florence

  and now the eyes of this great
despot prince in all but name had
fastened upon me bright deadly in-
tent flared from them like fire from
black flint

  is that the assassin he demanded
seize him some of you

  i turned toward him

  i am no assassin your magnifi-
cence i protested it was a fair
fight and this guardsman of yours
forced-

  but as i began to speak two of the
men in mail and leather moved swiftly
to my right elbow and my left the
iron gauntlet of one snatched away
my sword and the other man roughly
caught my shoulder

  silence he growled in my ear
speak when you are spoken to
others of the party were busy ques-
tioning witnesses who were many and

giuliano in florence since  was the true founder
of florentine greatness and was a most benevolent

relled was led forward i mounted
and one of the men-at-arms caught the
bridle reins in the crook of his arm

will shed your tripes upon the street

chapter vii
lorenzo the magnificent

w orenzo and his handsome com-
i panion had ridden on behind
him rode his retinue one of them with
gidos limp body across his saddlebow
i myself on the gray with the two
guards brought up the rear

  as we departed i glanced back at
the bottega the crowd was moving
and murmuring and in its midst stood
andrea verrocchio staring after me
through his spectacles

  we had not ridden much more than
two miles and had made few turns
before our little procession entered
a great paved yard before a white
stone palace a groom appeared to
lead away the horses of lorenzo and
his companion while the soldiers rode
around to a guard-house at the rear
leading me with them

  through a small barred door i was
ushered into the palace building then
through a hallway in which stood a
sentry in breastplate and steel cap
finally i was escorted into a small
room finished in great rough stones
and with a single iron-latticed win-
dow it had one stool no carpet and
no table

  await here your punishment one
of my captors bade me and i was
locked in

  i waited there was nothing to do

but think and nothing to think but
doleful thoughts my victory over the
bully swordsman mingled as it was of
luck and knowledge from another cen-
tury had brought me not fame but
disaster lorenzo de medici himself
had seen fit to notice me and with an-
ger i knew well that this scion of a
great and unscrupulous race had the
power of life and death in florence
and that in my case the power of death
was more apt to be cxercised than the
power of life

  to be sure i had been drawn on
first had fought only in self-defense
but what judge would hear me lor-
enzo who through me had lost a val-
ued servant what jury would ponder
my case no jury i might not be
allowed to speak in my own defense
even a nod a word and i would be
condemned to death with nobody to
question or to mourn

  nobody what about lisa but i
had to put her from my mind

  thus i mused in the blackest of
humors until a faint stirring sound at
the window made me lift my eyes a
small childlike face hung there-the
face of the deceptively handsome
dwarf of guaracco

  he cautioned me to silence with a
tiny finger on his lips then with the
utmost suppleness and skill thrust his
wisp of a body between the iron bars
how even so small a creature could do
it i have no idea but in two seconds
he stood in front of me smoothing out
the wrinkles of his little surcoat
what do you here i demanded
it was easy he chuckled by a
vine i swung from the street and over
the wall in a tuft of brambles i
lurked until the sentry walked by i
am here with a message from ser
guaracco your master and mine
well i prompted a faint hope
wakening in me guaracco had
claimed some influence perhaps he
was bestirring himself on my behalf

  the message said the dwarf is
this hanging is an easy death and a
swift

  hanging i echoed i am to be
hanged

  perhaps the little head wagged
wisely that is the punishment for
twice in time



brawlers and killers in hot blood but
there are other punishments he
smiled up impudently a witch a
devils apostle for instance may be
burned at the stake by comparison
a sorry end

  i grew ironic myself your riddles
become easy to read imp i said ser
guaracco is anxious that i make no
claims of coming to him miraculously
-that i say nothing of being nour-
ished and ordered to assist him in his
intrigues

  they breed quick minds where you
come from said the dwarf

  go back i told him back and
say that i know his selfish reason but
that his advice is good i will not in-
volve him in my ruin better to hang
than to burn

the little fellow nodded quickly
turned and wriggled out between
the bars like a lizard

  time wore on and i felt weary and
hungry finally pushing my stool
back so that i could lean in the cor-
ner i dozed off a rough voice awak-
ened me

  gods wounds knave you do slum-
ber at the very lip of death rise and
come with me lorenzo the magnifi-
cent has sent for you

  i got to my feet and rubbed my eyes
night had come and i walked out of
my dark cell toward the light held at
the open door two men in steel-
mounted leather waited a bristle-
bearded captain and a lanky swords-
man with a scarred cheek

  between them i walked away into a
long hall around a corner across an
open courtyard-it was a clear starry
night overhead-and into a building
beyond a sentry challenged us in the
arras-hung vestibule we entered at
an explanatory word from the bearded
captain he waved us on through a cur-
tained doorway

  the room in which we came to a halt
was not spacious but lofty and lighted
by no less than eight lamps on tables
and brackets or hung by chains from
the groined ceiling the walls were
frescoed with scenes and figures of
grecian mythology and the floor was
richly carpeted

  at a table of polished ebony with in-
laid borders and figures of ivory sat
lorenzo de medici in a magnificent
dove-gray houppelande with furred
neck and wrists his ugly face was
toward us beside him was stationed
a scribe or secretary in the hooded
gown of a monk busy with pen and
ink

  but standing before the table with
back toward us was a long spare man
with a red pate he could be none but
guaracco and he was speaking as we
entered in the gentle plausible man-
ner he could affect so well

 magnificence he was saying
smoothly if to be related to the
young man is a crime i must plead
guilty it is true that i arranged for
his education as ser andrea verroc-
chio testified before you just now
but concerning this butchery of your
poor servant i must say that i have no
reaction save surprise and sorrow

  he was clearing his skirts of me
then

  lorenzo leaned back in his chair of
state it was a square-made armchair
of massive carved wood

  i wonder i wonder the ruler of
florence almost crooned his eyes
probed guaracco like sharp points and
if anything could unsettle the sor-
cerer-scientists aplomb it would be
such a regard it is possible con-
tinued lorenzo that you assigned
him to the task of murdering gido
but here is the young man himself
his story may be revealing

 the captain who had brought me
now thrust me forward with a push of
thick knuckles fn my back loren-
zos eyes met mine and i returned him
as level a stare as possible

 stand aside guaracco com-
manded lorenzo now young
man your name

  leo thrasher i replied

 leo-what

  and lorenzo shook his head over
my surname which all italians have
found difficult the clerk pen in
hand asked me how to spell it

  a barbarous cognomen which be-
speaks the barbarous fellow re-
marked lorenzo sententiously what
defense have you to offer


startling stories

  only that i did not murder your
guardsman but killed him in a fair
fight i made respectful reply

guaracco standing against the
wall gave me a little nod of ap-
proval and drew in his lips as though
to council prudence

  lorenzo turned and took several
sheets of writing from his monkish
companion

  according to the testimony of oth-
ers you were the aggressof said he
you interfered and struck him after
he had fallen from his horse

  he flogged the beast cruelly i
protested i used my bare fist upon
him and he drew his sword i say i
but defended myself

  do not contradict his magnifi-
cence the middle-aged clerk cau-
tioned me bleakly

  and do not traduce the name of
poor dead gido added lorenzo his
eyes still raked me i have lost a
good servant in him

  perhaps i said on sudden inspir-
ation i can make good his loss
how exclaimed lorenzo and his
black eyes narrowed as a swords-
man in my guard but gido had con-
quered hundreds

  i conquered gido i reminded him
despite the fact that guaracco was
signaling again for prudence lor-
enzo saw those signals and turned in
his chair

  ha guaracco by the bones of the
saints i do begin to understand it
youll have planned that this creature
of yours might rise on the dead shoul-
ders of his victim and be taken into
my service as an invincible blade
then being near me and myself un-
guarded-

  ajs heaven is my judge this is not
my doing exclaimed guaracco un-
strung at last

  i spoke again to save myself and
him too

  if i cannot be trusted to guard
your magnificence i have other
worthy gifts i thought a moment
marshaling what latter-day science
my memory still retained i can
build bridges i can make war ma-
chines of various kinds i can show

you how to destroy fortresses-
indeed broke in lorenzo how
came you by all this knowledge
more of guaraccos doing i make no
doubt he is whispered to be a sor-
cerer another of his darted side-
long looks made the tall man shake
violently you too young man
death is the severe penalty for black
magic

  i recognized defeat and shrugged
my shoulders in exasperation

  i shall not weary you with further
pleas your magnificence i said
call me wizard as well as murderer
i am neither but you are determined
to destroy me as well be hanged for
a sheep as fqr a lamb

  the captain at my elbow made a mo-
tion as though to drag me away but
lorenzo lifted one long white hand
with a many-jeweled ring upon the
forefinger

  wait tell me-what was that you
said

  i said as well be hanged for a sheep
as for a lamb

  hanged for a sheep as for a- a
grin came slowly as if it did not well
know the way to that rugged face it
made lorenzo strangely handsome
neatly said by bacchus he spoke
to the clerk write that down here
we have one gift that was never won
from yonder dull guaracco

  i was stunned at the zest with which
he repeated the cliche

  why your magnificence i said
wonderingly it is but a saying a
handful of old words

  yet the thought is new a new thing
under the sun say on leo the witty
if you are an assassin set to kill me
your tongue is as tempered as your
sword

he called the phrase new and of
course it was the fifteenth
century had never heard it before
every cliche must have been devastat-
ing in its time

  i groped in my mind for another
and the works of william shake-
speare a good century in the future
came to my rescue

  since i am graciously permitted to
plead my case once more i said let
twice in time



i spread and beat the wings-the ground
seemed a long way off chapter x

 me but remind your magnificence that
 the quality of mercy is not strained
 it drops as the gentle rain from heaven
 upon the earth beneath-
 excellent applauded lorenzo
 clerk have you written it all he
 smiled upon me the more widely and
 winningly you go free young sir
 swordsmen i can buy at a ducat a
 dozen but men of good wit and ready
 tongue are scarce in these decayed
 times tomorrow then you shall have
 a further audience with me

 bowed myself away scarce
crediting my good fortune but
as i walked down the palace steps and
through the gate guaracco fell into
step beside me under his half-draped
black cloak i caught the outline of
that pistol he had invented

   i have nothing to say to you i
 growled i have washed my hands of
 you and you washed your hands of
 me yonder when my life hung by a
 thread

   i never pledged myself to you he
 reminded nor did i demand a pledge
 of you-only obedience instead of
 death you win favor from the medici
 when you go back tomorrow you go
 under new orders from me

   and thus i was deeper than ever in
 his strong wicked clutch


startling stories

chapter viii
the court of lorenzo

perhaps it is odd and yet not
so odd that i remember no more
of that particular walk of my warm
disgust at guaraccos confident leer
of his insistence on my aid to him it
is my fixed belief that during our con-
versation he found and took the op-
portunity to throw upon me his hyp-
notic spell he could do that almost
as well as the best twentieth-century
psychologists

  walking together thus on the way
to verrocchios bottega i entranced
and somnambulistic he alert and stud-
ied there must have been strong talk-
ing by guaracco and receptive listen-
ing by me he must have planted in
my dream-bound mind that i was his
friend and debtor that i must share
lorenzos favor with him guaracco

  what i do remember is the next aft-
ernoon and an equerry from the palace
presenting himself before an im-
pressed verrocchio with a message
summoning me to his master i went
dad in my simple best-the decent
doublet and hose which guaracco had
given me on my first evening at his
house my red mantle and a flat velvet
cap with a long drooping feather
with a little shock of pleased aston-
ishment i saw that the equerry had
brought me a horse--the same fine
gray over which i had fallen out with
the late lamented gido

  the beast is a present from the
magnificent i was informed as i
mounted

  to the palace we rode and there
while my horse was cared for by the
equerry i was conducted through a
great courtyard to a rich garden among
high hedges of yew trimmed to a
blocky evenness with nichelikre hol-
lows for stone seats or white statues of
grecian style there were roses both
on bushes and climbing briars flower-
ing shrubs m clumps and ordered
rows a perfectly round little pool with
water klies-all luxurious and lovely
though perhaps a bit too formally or-

dered in the center of this under a
striped awning lounged lorenzo and
his friends on cushioned seats of
gilded wood and leather

  to the four other guests i wag intro-
duced as ser leo his magnificence
still shied at pronouncing my barbar-
ous surname and i bowed to each as
his name was spoken first there was
lorenzos younger brother and co-
despot giuliano the same cavalier
who had ridden with lorenzo upon me
at the moment of gidos death he
was one of the handsomest men i have
ever seen even as lorenzo was one of
the ugliest

  almost as highly honored was an
elderly churchman with a fine merry
face and plain but rich vestments-
mariotto arlotta the aristocratic ab-
bot of the woodland monastery of ca-
maldoli his repute i found was that
his repartee was the sharpest and read-
iest in all the state of tuscany and
indeed he jested in a lively though ec-
clesiastical fashion

  close beside him stood a plump
courteous young man in his middle
twenties sandro botticelli the rising
court painter him i found friendly
though moody

  the last man of the group and the
youngest was an adolescent poet ag-
nolo poliziano uglier even than lo-
renzo he was wry-necked crooked-
mouthed beak-nosed and bandy-
legged yet for all this sorry per-
son and ungrown youth he was elo-
quent and thoroughly educated from
him i was to learn in after days much
of what a man must know to shine as
cultured in fifteenth-century flo-
rence

young sparkle-wit friends
lorenzo told the others in
presenting me he was thrown in my
way i nothing doubt with the thought
that he might assassinate me yet am
i drawn to him by the lustrant wisdom
of his speech as well hang for a

   	botticellis most famous paintings are those of
giuliaros sweetheart simonetta vespucci he was a
tauorite of florentine society and a loyal fnend of the
medicis

    poliziatjo in lajer lie was a tutor to the chil-
dren of lortnio and remained in the medici household
until the death of his patron
twice in time



sheep as for a lamb he defied me yes-
terday

  he paused while the saying went
around the delighted group from
mouth to merry mouth

  if he is dangerous yet shall i keep
him as i keep the lions at the piazza
del signoria guard me all of you
from any weapon save his tongue
once more he turned to me what of
that sorcerer cousin of yours guarac-
co

  to my own surprise i found myself
pleading earnestly and eloquently for
guaracco it was as if i had been re-
hearsed in the task and indeed i prob-
ably was by guarracco himself hyp-
notists i say again can do such things
in the end lorenzo smiled and seemed
far less ugly

  by the mass i wish my own kins-
men spoke so well on my behalf he
said to the others ser leo your elo-
quence saved you yesterday and to-
day it recommends guaracco he is
dull i have thought but he knows
something of science i am minded to
send for him for all he is a wizard

  sorcery cannot prevail against
pure hearts contributed the abbot
mariotto at which all laughed heart-
ily-

  the equerry who had conducted me
was dispatched to search for and bring
guaracco meanwhile i was served
with wine by a bold-eyed maid servant
in tight blue silk and entreated to join
the conversation it was turning just
then on the subject of a new alliance
of the italian powers against possible
turkish invasion

  the threat of the infidel comes at

an opportune time lorenzo pointed
out taunted and menaced we chris-
tians forget our differences and draw
together for our common safety the
sultan dares not attack us we dare not
quarrel among ourselves and peace
reigns 

  your magnificence does not like
war then i ventured

  he shook his ugly crag of a head
not a whit it is expensive

  and vulgar added botticelli
aye and dangerous chimed in the
poet poliziano

  and in defiance of heavens will
sighed the abbot as though to crown
the matter

  and yet lorenzo resumed i be-
think me that it is well for a state to
prepare for war that others may fear
and be content to keep peace i have it
in mind ser leo that you spoke yes-
terday of war engines

  i did was my reply but even as
i spoke i was aware how poorly my
scrambled memory might serve me
for instance i might design a gun
that shoots many times

 ha some of guaraccos witch-
craft exclaimed lorenzo at once

  not in the least i made haste to
say nothing but honest science and
mechanics may it please your mag-
nificence

  in my mind the form and principle
of machine-gunnery became only half
clear i wished that i had mentioned
something else

 	lorenzo was later able to bring about this alli-
 ance both for ceace among the kalian powers and
 safety frotn the moslem raiders

startling stories

but lorenzo would not be dis-
suaded from knowing all about
my oft-shooting gun he sent polizi-
ano for paper and pencils an ordered
me to drav plans i made shift in
some fashion to do a picture of a gun-
carriage with wheels a trail and a
mounting of not one barrel but a
whole row ten or more

  it is nothing of particular brilli-
ance objected the poet a rank of
arquebusiers would serve as well
aye but if we have not overmany
ranks of arequebusiers countered
lorenzo and gave me a most generous
smile a single man i think could
serve and aim and fire this row of guns
ten such machines could offer a full
hundred shot well aimed and timely
discharged that hundred shot might
decide a great battle

  encouraged i offered a variation of
the idea a larger and wider gun em-
placement with not small barrels but
regular cannon placed in a row and
slightly slanted toward the center
these i suggested could be so trained
as to center their fire on a single point
the bank of cannon wheeled into po-
sition and the fuses lighted in quick
succession could throw a shower of
heavy shot against a single small area
upon a rampart or wall battering it
open

  right you are applauded lo-
renzo it would outshine the great-
est battering-ram in all christendom
it may be improved i continued
by explosive shot in the cannon
explosive shot giuliano repeated
in sharp protest how ser leo is
not all shot solid can lead and iron
explode

  yes with powder and a fuse in-
side i said at once though none too
surely

 now nay he argued what
would prevent such a shot from ex-
ploding in the very mouth of the can-
non belike splitting its barrel and do-
ing injury to our own soldiers

  i had to shake my head saying that
i couldnot answer definitely just then

  then answer another time said
lorenzo kindly in the meanwhile
-he picked up my two drawings-
these will go to my armorers for

models to be made ser leo can draw
us other things as well

  he draws notably contributed
botticelli

  evening had drawn on lamps were
lighted and we had supper in the gar-
den a richer and spicier meal than i
care for there was plenty of wine
and all drank freely of it not except-
ing the abbot finally some fruits and
ice-cooled sherbet were brought and
at this dessert we were joined by five
or six ladies

  most beautiful and arresting among
these was the famous simonetta ves-
pucci the reigning toast of florence
she was no more than eighteen years
old as i judged but mature in body
and manner a tall slenderly elegant
lady a little sloping in the shoulders
but otherwise beyond criticism in the
perfection of her figure her abun-
dant hair gleamed golden and her
proud face was at once warmly and
purely handsome

  all the men were her frank and de-
voted admirers i have heard that the
very shopkeepers and artisans who
saw her pass on the street were wont
to roll their eyes in awe at her loveli-
ness and even to fight jealously over
this noble creature they dared not ad-
dress of those present she appeared
to prefer the dark dashing giuliano de
medici

fear that it will be a hot sum-
mer she mourned as she fin-
ished her sherbet there will be lit-
tle ice left in the storehouses even
now

  nay then i made haste to say
ice may be kept through the hottest
months if it is placed in houses
banked with earth i quickly
sketched such a half-buried shed
and also let the ice be covered deep
with sawdust and chaff

  how demanded the painter bot-
ticelli i have known chaff to be
placed over fruit in a shop and so keep
it from freezing if chaff keeps fruit
warm will it also make ice cold

  i was on the point of launching into
a discussion of refrigeration and insu-
lation but prudently stopped short

  it does indeed bring coldness i
twice in time



assured him or rather it keeps the
coldness that is tiiere already

 black magic muttered abbot
marriotto crossing himself with a be-
ringed hand

  nay white magic decided lo-
renzo for it does good on earth does
it not and no harm to any creature
ser leo do you guarantee that ice
will thus remain through the summer
and not perish he turned to a serv-
ant go you he ordered and sum-
mon a secretary and then to me
he shall make notes of what you say
young sir and tomorrow shall see the
building of such a house therein my
ice shall lie with good store of chaff
to insure its cold

 this strange young man is a
learned doctor said the silvery voice
of a lady who toyed with a goblet of
jeweled gold

  does he not know of more exalted
things than chaff and houses buried in
the earth asked simonetta vespucci
deigning to smile upon me ser leo
-for so you seem to be called-can
you not tell us a tale of these stars
which now wink out in the sky and
float above our earth

  her eyes and her smile dazzled me
understandably along with any man
on whom they turned perhaps that
is why i ventured to dazzle her in turn

  madonna simonetta i said per-
mit me to say that those stars are
worlds greater than ours

  greater than ours she cried and
laughed most musically but they
are no more than twinklets full of
spikes and beams like a little shining
burr

  they are far away madonna i
said a man -if only at the distance
of a hundred paces appears so small
that he can be contained within the eye
of a needle held close before you so
with these bodies which are like the
sun-

  the sun she interrupted the
sun ser leo is round not full of
points like a star

  there was applause of her lively
protest from all the men and most of
the women

  for answer i took up a sheet of the
paper on which i had been sketching

  and asked for the loan of a pin one
of the ladies had a silver bodkin in her
cap and offered it with this i pierced
a hole in the paper

  madonna i addressed simonetta
hold this hole to your eye and look
through it the smallness of the open-
ing will shut away the glitter  so
you do it correctly now-i pointed
to where in the evening sky hung
shimmering jupiter-look yonder is
that star seen through the hole in your
paper a burr or a small round body

  this is marvelous she exclaimed
it is indeed round like a gold coin
seen from a distance

the others cried out in equal as-
tonishment and each must needs
look through the hole in the paper at
jupiter i turned over in my mind the
possibilities of explaining a telescdpe
but decided not to offer another foggy
theory that i could not support with
exact plans or models i contented
myself with attempting to lecture on
astronomy

  gentlemen and fair ladies i said
as impressively as i could manage
these stars look so small that nothing
appears less yet there are a great many
that are far larger than our own earth
think then how trivial our own star
would appear if-

  faith cousin called out a voice i
knew you seek to belittle the world
and florence and lorenzo the mag-
nificent

  it was guaracco absolutely over-
whelming in green and gold who
strode forward and paid fulsomely
cordial respects all around

  forgive my young kinsman your
magnificence if he has been imperti-
nent he pleaded eloquently then
turning to me will you step aside
leo i have a message for you from
lisa

  at the mention of that name a little
murmur of laughing congratulation
went up to the effect that i must have
a sweetheart indeed i felt a quicken-
ing of my pulse as guaracco and i
walked a little away through the gar-
den out of the range of the lamplight

  what is the message from her i
asked him


startling stories

  that was but an excuse to get you
alone he growled i warn you leo
say no more of these matters of the
stars

  but why not i demanded sur-
prised

   the stars in their courses are a spe-
cific knowledge of sorcerers i over-
heard your teaching just now-

  i was teaching truth i broke in
warm to defend myself

   i know it he said i do not think
this little mote our planet is the cen-
ter of all things but the old belief is
part of my trade i frighten or reward
or guide men by horoscopes and
prophecies-from the stars do you
not show me a liar else i may smooth
your way to destruction

  i glared at him but in my mind was
more wonder than rage once again
he showed himself a sound scientist
once again he showed that he hid his
knowledge and fostered error for
profit only some great evil wish dic-
tated such action i need not be too
ashamed i feel to say that he made
me afraid

chapter ix
the end of the evening

guaracco did his best to be the
lion of the occasion not that he
did not merit attention he could
charm and astound and inform lo-
renzo publicly and good-humoredly
withdrew his previous opinion that
guaracco was dull and bade him talk
on any subject he would strange
philosophy-crammed conversation in-
trigued lorenzo as the jokes of a jes-
ter or the gambols of jugglers might
intrigue a more shallow ruler

  and guaracco obliged with im-
provements upon my discussion of war
machines to my multiple-fire device
he added a suggestion whereby the
crossbows of lorenzos guard might
be improved-a simple quick lever to
draw and set the string instead of the
slower and more cumbersome mouli-
net or crank

  the company praised and approved

  the idea and guaracco beamed he
liked it less when botticelli suggested
and lorenzo agreed that i make
clearer his rough sketch of the lever
action

  i perceive-guaracco smiled sa-
tirically-that you also admire my
kinsmans drawing has he told you
of that other talent he hopes tb de-
velop flying

  flying repeated the beautiful
simonetta her eyes shining

  aye that with a machine called
an airplane

  he used the twentieth-century
english word and i must have started
visibly how did he know that name
and invention i did not remember
telling him about airplanes but si-
monetta was already laughing incredu-
lously

  belike this young man seeks to
soar with wings and reach those great
worlds and suns he pretends to see in
the sky she suggested merrily a
twinkle in her eyes

  it sounds like sacrilege giuliano
garnished his sweethearts apparent ef-
fort to embarrass me flight is con-
trary to mans proper nature

  i	was a little angry how con-
trary i demanded is it more con-
trary or sacrilegious than to ride com-
fortably and swiftly on the back of a
horse

  the abbot came to my support
the young man says sooth he pro-
nounced holy writ sings of the
righteous they shall mount up with
wings as eagles and again in the
words of the psalmist himself o
that i had wings like a dove surely
such flight would not be ungodly un-
less it were accomplished by the aid of
black magic

  well ser leo lorenzo prompted
me

  he leaned back in his cushioned
chair of state crossing one long nobby
leg over the other his companions
grouped themselves gracefully if sy-
cophantically around him all were
waiting for my reply to the abbots last
suggestion

  your magnificence there is no such
thing as black magic i said either
in my devices or elsewhere
twice in time



  every eye widened and guaracco
stiffened as though i had prodded him
with a dagger i remembered that he
had come close to frightening me not
an hour before and determined to
make some amends to my own self-re-
spect

fest to him no lock no fortress could
remain shut against his will he could
travel the uttermost parts of the uni-
verse but why do i go on adding
instance to instance what could not
be brought to pass by such a mechani-
cian

i fashioned clay tubes for the acid chapter xvi

  of all human discourses i elabo-
rated warmly watching him the most
foolish is that which affirms a belief
in necromancy guaracco glared but
i did not hesitate if this necro-
mancy or black magic did truly exist
he who controlled it would be lord of
all nations and no human skill could
resist him buried treasure and the
jewels of earths heart would lie mani-

as i finished there was a sigh a
mutter and finally lorenzo
struck his hands together in applause

  well said ser leo he cried do
you not think so guaracco does
this not prove that there are no sor-
cerers

  it proves at least my innocence
of the charge of sorcery guaracco
smiled and bowed to give the reply

strength if i could do such things
would i be so humble and dependent
a servant of your magnificence
surely-and his eyes found mine
once more-nothing is impossible to
a true necromancer

  nothing i agreed except refuge
from death

  his smile vanished

  lorenzo lolled more easily in his
chair

  this bethinks me he remarked
one matter has not been settled ser
leo is a boy a student of the arts yet
he conquers with ease my nonpareil
swordsman that smacks of enchant-
ment

  i spread my hands in one of the free
florentine gestures i was beginning
to use

  i make bold to deny that it was
aught but skill

  we must make trial

  his magnificence permitted himself
another faint grin i must have shown
an expression of worry for giuliano
burst out into confident laughter and
sprang forward hand on hilt

  let me do the trying he cried his
gay handsome face thrusting at me in
the white light of the lamps

  simonettas silvery chuckle ap-
plauded her cavalier the abbot also
called for this unecclesiastical per-
formance to take place without delay
before i well knew what was happen-
ing the chairs benches and other
furniture had been thrust back the
lamps trimmed to give more light and
i faced giuliano in the center of the
cleared space poliziano had run to
fetch something and he came close
to me

  here young sir he said defend
yourself and he thrust a hard ob-
ject into my hand

  giuliano had already drawn his
sword and wadded his cloak into a
protection on his free arm i trans-
ferred my own weapon to my left arm
and at sight of it my heart sank it
was a mere cane of wood hard and
round and of a swords length such
as florentine lads used for fencing
practice giuliano on the other hand
fell on guard with a blade that was one
of the finest and sharpest i ever saw

plainly i was to furnish sport for this
gallant and his friends and all the ad-
vantages were denied me

  because i must i lifted the cudgel
to cross his steel lorenzo grunted

  your cousin is sinister-handed
guaracco he observed belike that
is the secret of his skill

  i fear not said giuliano with un-
malicious zest and he disengaged and
thrust at me

  apparently he meant business for
the point would have nicked wounded
my breast had i not shortened my own
arm and beat it aside cheers went
up from the ladies-then slid into
dismayed screams for extending my
parry to its conclusion as a riposte i
smote giuliano smartly on the inside
of the elbow and he wheezed in pain
and sprang back out of reach had i
followed and struck again he might
have been forced to drop the sword
but i realized that i had to do with
the second greatest man in florence
and only stood my ground

  giuliano laughed again gods
wounds what a tingler he praised
me ill ward it another time
forward he came again right foot
advanced his cloaked left arm brought
well up again i awaited his thrust
parried it and drove it out of line then
riposted as before he as good as his
promise interposed the folds of the
cloak taking a muffled tap on his left
forearm but that hurt him somewhat
and he retreated this time i followed
him avoided an engagement and half
struck at his head but i stopped in
time fearing to injure him and make
dangerous enemies instead i di-
verted the course of the stroke into a
sweeping moulinet passing over his
weapon to my right and his left and
terminated it in a resounding thwack
on giulianos velvet-sleeved sword
arm

absolute silence fell then a
murmur of consternation from
the onlookers for giulianos smile
had vanished and his eyes flashed fire
plainly the contest had ceased to be
sport with him-my thumps had made
him angry he snapped out a soft
blasphemy advanced quickly and
twice in time



sped a slashing cut-not at me but at
my stick the edge of his steel keen
as a razor shore through the tough
wood without effort and i was left
with a mere baton in my hand a trun-
cated billet no more than fifteen inches
long

  no no giuliano spare him called
out lorenzo but too late to balk his
brothers murderous stab at my throat

  i managed to parry with the short
length of wood remaining to me caus-
ing his point to shoot upward and over
my left shoulder at once i stepped
forward well within his lunge be-
fore he could retreat or recover my
free right hand caught the cross-guard
of his weapon and wrenched his
own right arm bruised twice in the
previous engagements had lost some
of its strength and in a trice i tore the
sword away from him

  at once i dropped my severed stick
fell back and whipped the captured
hilt into my left hand

  by your leave my lord i panted
i will continue the matter with this
more suitable equipment

  but then lorenzo poliziano and
guaracco had sprung forward and be-
tween us the sorcerer caught me in
his arms and wrestled me farther back
his red beard rasping my ear as he
hissed out a warning to take care lor-
enzo the magnificent was lecturing
giuliano in the manner of big brothers
in every land and generation and
giuliano recovered his lost temper

  hark you ser leo i did amiss
he called out to me laughing i had
no lust to hurt you at the beginning
i meant only fun and then- he
broke off still grinning and rubbed
his injured arm i forgot myself it
is not many who can teach me either
swordplay or manners but by saint
michael of the sword you have done
both

  it was handsomely said and i gladly
gave him back his weapon assuring
him that i bore no ill-will at that he
embraced me in the impulsive latin
manner swearing that he would stand
my friend forever the company sub-
sided to chairs again happy that no
harm had befallen either of us

  we wander from the path of our

earlier discourse reminded abbot
mariotto tactfully ser leo was
speaking of a flying machine where
is it my son

  it is not yet constructed holy fa-
ther i replied

  as with so many other things the
principle of flying a heavier-than-air
machine was caught only vaguely in
the back of my head i could visualize
roughly the form a thin body with a
rudder for tail and outspread wings
and something to stir the air

  belike you would strap wings to
your arms suggested giuliano

  impossible spoke up poliziano
are not mens arms too weak for
flight would there not need great
muscles at least as strong as those of
the legs

  i had an inspiration and an answer
the muscles of our legs are many
times stronger than needful to support
the weight of our bodies i told him

  lorenzo eager as always for new
philosophic diversion challenged me
to prove it i asked him to get me a
long tough plank and servants were
sent scurrying after it while i
waited i chose a strong straight
chair and sat upon it a cushion i
took and laid upon my knees when
the plank arrived i balanced it upon
this cushion

  now come all of you i invited
and rest yourselves upon this plank

lorenzo did so at once and then
his brother the others followed
laughingly not excepting the abbot
and madonna simonetta-ten in all
supported upon my knees only gu-
aracco stood aloof

  your long shank support many
hundredweight my stout cousin he
said but what does this prove

  it proves his argument and the
fallacy of mine handsomely replied
poliziano for me as he rose from his
seat at one end of the plank his legs
have tenfold strength and his arms
may be strong in proportion enough
to flap wings and waft upward his en-
tire weight

  then let me see it done pro-
nounced lorenzo with a grand final-
ity that made my heart sink i am


startling stories

ambitious ser leo to watch you
mount up with wings as eagles and
i do not forget the other arrangement
by which you will make solid shot to
explode

  this last labor which i had been
glad to slight in conversation now
seemed actually the easier

  but simonetta and the other ladies
professed themselves weary of cold
science be it ever so important in a
masculine world and demanded music
poliziano whose voice was as sweet
as his appearance was ungainly imme-
diately snatched up a silver lute and
picked out a lively tune the song he
rendered was saucy and merry and not
a little shocking but the holy abbot
led the loud applause

  more more cried simonetta
poliziano bowing low to her sang
to a more measured and dignified tune
an offering that had all the earmarks
of impromptu versification inasmuch
as it mentioned the beauty of simon-
etta the magnificence of lorenzo the
churchly dignity of abbot mariotto
and finally the enigmatic quality of
my own discourse

  and will not ser leo sing asked
one of the ladies when poliziano had
made an end his conversation and
talents are so varied-war science de-
bate flying like a bird-

  let us hear your voice young sir
lorenzo commanded me

  thus urged i took polizianos lute
altering the pitch and harmony of its
four strings until i could strum upon
it in a hit-or-miss fashion evoking
chords to accompany myself the
song which i managed to improvise
and sing to polizianos tune was on the
subject of stars so edifying to my new
friends and so distasteful to guaracco
since lorenzo and the others com-
mended it highly it may not be amiss
to set it down here

you think i am a spark-i am a star

you think that i am small but i am great
you think me dim but i am only far

far out in space beyond your love and hate

you think me feeble-but i am a sun
whose rule is resolute whose face endures
beneath whose heat and light are wonders
done

throughout a leash of nobler worlds than
   yours

you think you know my secrets and you say
that they are thus and thus-but through
the sky

my beam strikes from so many years away
you know not how i live nor when i die

chapter x
the bombs and the wings

silent as we departed from the
gathering together guaracco
soon spoke

  i know very little after all of how
you live he said but perhaps i can
arrange how and when you die that
song was meant to reproach me
just as you like i rejoined for my
fear of him had quite departed too
i was arraying my spirit against fur-
ther imposition of his will your
masterful ways become burdensome
guaracco i defy you

  and i paused near the palace gates
my fists clenched

 no violence he warned me i
carry a sword as well as that short gun
you saw yesterday and my dwarfs
are never far away you on the other
hand have not yet assumed our flor-
entine fashion of carrying arms his
beard stirred in the gloom and i knew
that he smiled but i shall not kill
you leo unless you force me all
these defiances stand me in good
stead

 in good stead i repeated for
after my temporary semi-hypnotized
slavishness nothing had been further
from my wish than to aid guaracco

  aye that in scorning magic and
upholding science you taught me a
lesson and few can boast of teaching
me anything of worth it is time for
me to forget my sorcery pretenses at
least where it concerns my relation-
ship to lorenzo science shall be my
way with him hereafter-but not too
much science you and i shall work
wonders for him the two of us

  am i to help you i sneered

  he shook his head laughing it is
i who shall help you for instance
that matter of exploding shot i saw
as did not lorenzo that you were per-
plexed but it happens that i may
twice in time



help you to fashion such a thing
again is it not true that you wish to
return some day to your own cen-
tury

  useless to deny that and i said so
and have you not forgotten many
details of your time-reflecting ma-
chine

  equally useless to deny that

  for instance went on guaracco
as we resumed our walk together you
have forgotten certain ways to use this
strange new power which you named
to me as electricity it gives light but
how

  i could not tell him

  i shall refresh your lost memory
is there not a certain bottle or globe
exhausted of air-and a wire of some
substance set glowing within-

  i clutched his arm so suddenly
fierce that he broke off and swore in
startled pain

  how do you know that i de-
manded yes i had forgotten en-
tirely but you knew and about air-
planes as well

  let me go he commanded here
come lorenzos grooms with our
horses

e accepted our mounts and
rode away side by side

  now said guaracco as we en-
tered a dim street lighted only by the
lanterns of a watch patrol you will
remember that i showed you a pearl
a beautiful jewel and it put you to
sleep

  you mean that in my trance i re-
membered-

  i could see how possible that was
meanwhile i braced my snirit lest he
try some other occult trick but he
only nodded as if to check the point

  i learned things about your science
which you yourself cannot grasp when
awake you shall look into the pearl
again leo and more knowledge will
creep forth we shall produce won-
ders for lorenzo winning great favor
and possessions and also build your
time reflector nay our time reflector
-for perhaps i shall make the jour-
ney through the ages with you

  he was swaying me very strongly
but still i resented his absorbing

mastery of every situation he seemed
to read my mind

  let us not be lord and servant any
more he offered but colleagues and
friends lorenzo is disposed to grant
us money for a shop of our own stay
on with verrocchio lest others become
suspicious but your spare time can
be applied to our own profit his
voice became sly lisa asks after
you lad she would be pleased to see
you again and for all your last words
to her i think you would be pleased
too is is not so

  finally i agreed to a truce and a
partnership after all it was the only
way to escape from the renaissance
and guaraccos concessions seemed
handsome at the time

  on the following day i skimped my
work with verrocchio and called on
guaracco at the little house where
once he had tried to bestow lisa upon
me lisa was there shy but appar-
ently glad to see me how had i been
able to admire simonetta vespucci so
greatly only twelve hours before i
could not understand but i did my
best to conceal my feelings guaracco
must not bring that influence to bear
upon me a second time

  as at his house in the country gu-
aracco had fitted up the cellar for lab-
oratory and workshop at once we be-
gan work on the explosive shot
which lorenzo had demanded

  at my recommendation we made it
cylindrical instead of round a good
eighteen inches long and six in diam-
eter bronze being light strong and
workable was our choce for the outer
shell of this bomb and i cut deep cross
lines in the outer surface so that it
might the more easily explode and fly
in pieces the inside we filled stra-
tegically with lumps of lead with
spaces between for powder

  guaracco though helpful was as
puzzled as giuliano de medici about
the delay in explosion to be certain
of that delay i mixed a slow-burning
powder with charcoal of willow wood
only lightly burnt the completed
mixture as no more than dark brown in
color and a noticeable interval of time
was needed for its ignition of this
slow-burning powder i made a fuse or


startling stories

match which led through a hole in the
rear part of the bomb

   the discharge from the cannon will
ignite the match i explained and
the explosion will come in as short a
space as you would take to say an
ave maria

   say an ave maria for the souls of
those it strikes guaracco laughed
with cruel relish

  we also made a more elaborate
bomb its curved sides pierced with
muzzles from which bullets could be
thrown by the explosion when both
were finished-we took only a morn-
ing and an afternoon-guaracco rec-
ommended that we wait before pre-
senting them to lorenzo

   i take a parable from the construc-
tion itself he admonished me de-
lay the explosion of this wonder it
will be the more effective with his
magnificence remember also that
when you have given him the explo-
sive shot he will demand at once the
flying machine

   that was excellent advice for i was
still muddled in my plan to build
man-lifting wings and guaracco could
not-or would not-help me

  i therefore went into the trading
centers of florence to shop for ma-
terials my teacher andrea verroc-
chio who had heard little of my prob-
lem suggested as framework the wood
of spanish yew which was employed
by the archers of england for their
superb longbows and was undoubt-
edly the strongest and lightest wood
to be had i purchased a bundle of
such staves which i thinned and
shaped by careful whittling and pro-
cured strong silk cloth for the fabric

my best model as it seemed to me
would be the wing of a bat i
went so far as to snare and kill several
birds-sorrowfully for i love animals
-and by manipulating their wings
and bodies i found out certain princi-
ples of flight these i demonstrated
by small-scale models to be hung on
threads and made to simulate flying
by a strong blast of air from a bellows
a new problem added itself to that of
the wings-the construction and man-
ipulation of the tail as a rudder i

sketched a design like a fan which i
hoped to control by pressure and mo-
tion of the feet

  guaracco professed a great deal of
interest in this work of mine which
took up all my spare time for several
days his interest seemed to partake
a little of superior amusement as
though he foresaw failure but lisa
was kindly and admiring and even
helped in the sewing of the fabric
which needed a womans skill i joined
the ribs of the wings and tail myself
with looped pieces of leather at the
junctures and my thread for sewing
and binding was new raw silk

  it was late in the summer of -
the last of august as i think-when
i had the trial of my machine

  for greater privacy we returned to
guaraccos country house the scene
of my first appearance in this age
guaracco led the way on his fine white
stallion i rode the gray that had be-
longed to my hapless adversary gido
which had later been given me by lor-
enzo

  lisa had a pretty little mule and
two grooms carried the unwieldy bun-
dles that held my wings and rudder
how and when guaraccos dwarfs
made the journey i do not know we
left them behind in florence but they
were waiting for us when we dis-
mounted at the country house ser-
vants like that pleased guaracco im-
mensely

  after a light noon repast of cold
meat bread and some white wine i
went to a shed at the back of the house
scrambling up i donned my pinions

  they measured almost thirty feet
from tip to tip and were fastened to
me with light strong straps under the
armpits around my biceps and be-
tween elbow and wrist there were
springy grips for my hands and by re-
laxing or applying squeeze-pressure i
could spread or fold the umbrellalike
ribs that supported the fabric the
tail was similarly fixed to my legs
which i could straddle to extend the
fan or hold close to fold it

  i gazed down to the ground it
seemed a long way off beneath me
stood lisa her face full of apprehen-
sive interest and at an upper rear win-
twice in time



dow of the house guaracco thrust his
red-bearded head forth to watch

  ready i said to myself go

  i sprang as i did so i spread and
beat the wings extended the tail down-
ward to give me direction in soaring
a sickening airy moment my face
turned up into the sunlight i seemed
to feel the world grow small beneath
me another longer moment with the
touch of triumph another beating
thrash of the wings then i whirled
helplessly-and fell

  i suppose i was stunned there was
a galvanizing shock and darkness
then from far away laughter-the de-
lighted laughter of guaracco blend-
ing with it came a second voice softer
gentler lisa was pattering a prayer
for my safety

struggling with my close-
clamped eyelids i managed to
gaze up lisas face was close above
mine all white except for the dark
worried eyes she had taken my head
in her lap

  you are not dead leo she asked

  not i i assured and i sat up it
was difficult for i was bruised in all
my limbs and the laboriously fash-
ioned wings and rudder were broken
to bits

  guaracco descended from his post at
the window and came out into the
yard

  not icarus himself plunged so
tragically from heaven he jibed

  i rose to my feet unstrapping the
tangled wreckage

  for a moment i flew i defended
myself the next time-

  must there be a next time inter-
posed lisa who still trembled pray
heaven you do not seek to fly again
she pleads most prettily guar-
acco observed stroking his beard
are you not content to remain on the
ground with her leo will you not
leave flight to the birds its proper
masters

  but i shook my head stubbornly
not i a bird is no more than an
instrument working according to
mathematical law it is within the
capacity of man to duplicate that in-
strument and its working i shall try
again and i shall succeed

  send that i am present to watch
said guaracco chuckling

  but he was more helpful when in
the house i stripped off my doublet
and showed bruised ribs and shoul-
ders his many skills included that
of mixing salves and ointments and
the sticky stuff he applied to my hurts
helped them swiftly and greatly

  in any case we had the bombs to
offer lorenzo

       chapter xi
       hopes of escape

bombs were a curiosity but ours
pleased lorenzo greatly when
guaracco and i returned to florence
with them he gave us an audience and
later entertainment on the terrace of
his villa in the pleasant green suburb
of fiesole

startling stories

  these things would do us credit in
any battle he was gracious enough to
say yet it is my hope to profit by
some more peaceable marvel of yours
what for example of that flying ma-
chine

  i make progress

  i attempted to put him off and
guaracco also labored to change the
subject we discussed the summer
heat and the threatened drying up of
wells

  may it please your magnificence
i made bold to say an irrigation plan
might be drawn up the waters of the
arno could supply the town in dryest
season and water the fields as well
that would benefit the people of
my beautiful florence said the des-
pot with one of his softening smiles
at play on that arrestingly ugly face

  again i pursued does it not
seem well to widen the streets of the
town a street should be as wide as
the houses are high

  make haste slowly he bade me
finish the flying machine before you
turn florence into a paradise

  but an early autumn with real tus-
cany frost enabled me to ask for time
and a brighter day as winter came
on i lived in florence working under
verrocchio at paintings statues metal
work and my own devices in the eve-
nings i had plenty of diversion for
the artist sandro botticelli showed
himself willing to become my friend
and sponsor in artistic society

  i was often entertained at great
mansions one or twice i was present
at informal dinners and discussions at
lorenzos palace and once at the
house of simonetta vespucci herself
there i met her kinsman amerigo
vespucci who had won fame as a geog-
rapher and map-maker visiting him
was a tall roan-haired young man from
genoa a sailor and adventurer

  cristoforo colombo vespucci in-
troduced him to botticelli and myself
as we stood warming ourselves before
an open fire of aromatic wood

  colombo i repeated the name
did things to my maddeningly dis-
torted recollections colombo hark
you sir you intend to follow the sea
for all your days

  the roan-haired visitor nodded and
smiled aye that i have visited the
infidel princes to the east and spain
and even england i hope to go fur-
ther some day

  go further i exclaimed excit-
edly i should think you will go fur-
ther  in my earnestness i laid a hand
on his shoulder ser cristoforo i
said much of the world remains un-
claimed undreamed of there are
whole continents besides these we
know-whole oceans and shoals of is-
lands it is fated for you to sail west-
ward to find a new world

  how a new world he asked me a
little puzzled

  this earth is round i informed
him weightily it is shaped like a
ball with oceans and lands at every
quarter of it in circumference it is
nearly twenty-five thousand miles

he burst into laughter at that so
hearty that botticelli and some
others looked up to see the reason

  i see it now ser leo cried cristo-
foro colombo you have been read-
ing that strange book by the english-
man

  what strange book i demanded
puzzled in my turn

  john mandeville was the english-
mans name and he wrote his tale of
wondrous travels a good hundred
years ago i bethink me he even said
that the circumference of the earth is
something near your measurement
above twenty thousand english
miles but to my mind it is smaller
than that with indias most eastern
spice islands not too many days sail-
ing out from the azores

  you tell us nothing new young
sir amerigo vespucci said to me
surely only the simple country folk
think that earth is other than round
and without end the journey of the
sun and stars the dropping down of a
vessels hull at the line of sky and sea
these prove the roundness of the
earth

   	the travels of sir john mandeville knight
existed in manuscript form as early as  the
theory of earths roundness common among intelligent
geographers in the fifteenth century is set out at
length by mandeville who describes a reputed voyage
nearly around the world in his own time
twice in time



  and so i might have demonstrated
by a voyage had some prince given me
ships rejoined colombo wistfully

  i could not help but assure him that
this gift would come to him in the year
 from the ruler of spain

  by your leave my friend i shall
wait until that happy day dawns he
said with a bow

  and that incident cured me of mak-
ing prophecies

  yet i was successful in fashioning
many devices which served to appease
lorenzo though i was so long in per-
fecting my flying machine the most
popular to peasants and porters as
well as to my companions in higher
social scale was the wheelbarrow

  as to my studies in art i was able
to contribute many suggestions which
verrocchio accepted gratefully
among them the rather obvious one
that a painter or sculptor of the living
figure should study anatomy such
study was most difficult in florence
for religious law frowned upon the
godless cutting up of bodies that
should have christian burial

 however lorenzo once again
showed himself ready to assist me and
i was enabled to visit the morgue to
study and even dissect bodies of pau-
pers some of my sketches verroc-
chio posted on the walls of his bottega
as ideal studies and we also assembled
on a pedestal the complete skeleton of
a horse to be observed in making
equestrian paintings and studies

  at the end of winter lorenzo en-
tertained galleazo maria sforza the
duke of milan in lavish manner an-
drea verrocchio was pageant master
during those glittering days and i
helped him to plan processions of
horsemen and costumed figures routs
balls receptions and miracle plays
and even a warlike afternoon of joust-
ing in one of the public squares

  here banks of seats were erected all
around a cleared space so that the
square resembled a stadium or hippo-
drome and various florentine cava-
liers tilted against the followers of
the milanese ruler lorenzo offered
in what he must have thought a kindly
mood to provide me with armor a
lance and a war horse that i might

take part in the activity when i de-
clined he thought that i was being
only modest

  you are an artist and scientist he
argued and therefore among free
florentines at least a gentleman and
the peer of any do not be afraid of
these lords with their lances

but i managed to beg off though
the sport was not as dangerous as -  

i had surmised for one thing the
opposing cavaliers did not dash fujfe 
upon each other they rode on op-
posite sides of a paling endeavoring 
to strike or push across it with lance- - t
point against shield or helmet

  for another thing professional sol-
diers were barred as apt to forget- 
themselves giuliano de medici hand ij
some and dashing wore a knot of ribij r 
bon tied upon his mail-clad arm by
the beautiful simonetta and over-
threw two opponents otherwise the
jousting struck me as rather tame 
lorenzo took special pride in show-o 
ing his art treasures to sforza who as- i
poliziano later told me cried out that
mere gold and silver could not approx-j
imate such riches of the soul ancl
when the milanese departed they were p
too greatly impressed to hide their ad-
miration-which was what lorenzo
had hoped

  it had been guaraccos earnest am-
bition to make a friend of galleazo
sforza but after a carefully contrived
interview on the final day of the visit
he sought me out at verrocchios bot-
tega shaking his head

  sforza is too absolute a tyrant
among his milanese he complained

  is money not something i sug-
gested teasingly for in those days we
were on terms of something resem-
bling good fellowship

  he shook his foxy red head money
is little to me i want power i want
wills to be bowed to mine cities to rise
or fall at my lifted hand great men to
go on missions here and there with my
words and wishes upon their lips i
want the oceans to shake with the
passage of my ships the continents to
vibrate under the marching feet of my
armies i want to rule

  money rules i reminded look

startling stories

at lorenzo the founder of his house
was a druggist a simple maker of pills
yet by the accumulation and the wise
use of gold-

  gold snorted guaracco it buys
food clothes wine music-but of
what value is it save to attract
thieves it was powerful with the
medici only through generations of
careful planning and i cannot wait so
long cold steel is the better metal if
held by a brave man and ruled by a
wise one

  i began to appreciate something of
the ambition that stirred this charla-

  i followed sorcery from boyhood
guaracco went on because at first i
believed in it as you yourself once
put it a true sorcerer could travel
winds chain lightnings know and rule
the universe even when i found that
supposed enchantments were but a
fraud i remained a student and prac-
titioner of the false art-and i have
won some rewards

  you saw my coven of deluded
witch-worshippers they serve me in
many ways because of fear or awe or
fascination that they would never
dare if i offered them only gold too
a great many nobles and merchants re-
spect and fear me because i seem to
foretell events can cast horoscopes
and apparently summon devils and
one or two are well within my power
i gave a certain man poison for in-
stance to serve a certain other man
that certain other man owes me both
gratitude for the vengeance and fear
lest i betray him

  but now you follow true science
i said you told me so

  science-and sorcery of a kind

  i shook my head there is no such
thing as sorcery

  is there not come with me

once again i accompanied him to
his house nearby the front room
was changed in that there was a mas-
sive square table with a thick velvet
covering extending to the floor on all
sides in its center stood a great bowl
of silver-coated glass

  guaracco drew the heavy curtains
so that it was quite dark in the room

and lighted a candle then at the
clap of his hands the two dwarfs en-
tered with a great ewer of water be-
tween them from this guaracco
filled the bowl to the brim

  look into it leo he bade me as
the dwarfs departed

  i did so what then i challenged
him here is a simple basin of wa-
ter

  you are sure of that he persisted
thrust in your hands and convince
yourself

  again i obeyed him it was water
sure enough and beneath it the sur-
face of the bowl was smooth and nor-
mal

  i see no wonder i said to guar-
acco

  what did you expect to find in that
bowl the face of lisa and he
laughed favor me kinsman by
blowing out the candle

  i blew it out the room fell all dark
at once no not all for a faint filtered
glow came up from the bowl of water

  a chemical trick i pronounced
immediately you have put phos-
phorous in there

  did you not see the water poured
from pitchers he asked but i
make no argument look into the
bowl again

  as he spoke he put in his own hand
and stirred the liquid into ripples i
saw nothing but a disturbed surface
like a tiny ocean in a gale with light
beneath then the ripples grew less
slowed finally departed i gazed deep
into the radiant water

  from its bottom a face looked up at
me

  lisa

  i think i spoke her name aloud and
put forth a hand to touch her fore-
head but my finger only dipped into
water and guaracco laughed his fa-
miliar mocking peal

  you were deceived for all your as-
surance he taunted me quickly he
moved to uncurtain the windows let-
ting in light see it was simple i
arranged it an hour ago to mystify one
of the milanese a hole in the table
a glass bottom in the bowl-and un-
der the velvet a couch whereon lisa
lay with a light beside her-
twice in time




startling stories

  he lifted a corner of the cloth and
lisa slowly emerged

  it was as if you looked upon her
through a window guaracco summed
up he saw that i gazed reproachfully
at the girl and laughed ooce again

  now nay leo she did not deceive
you of herself i put her to sleep as
you know i can do-with this

  he held it up in his fingers-the
glowing pearl that more than once be-
fore had drawn forth my wits star-
ing at it unguardedly i felt myself en-
snared before i could set up my de-
fense he caught my elbow with his
other hand easing me into a chair as
mists closed about me

  when i awoke guaracco sat at the
velvet-covered table scribbling hast-
ily upon a tablet of white paper

  you will rejoice he said seeing
my eyes open i took opportunity to
open again that closed memory of
yours

  what this time

  details of the machine you forgot
the time reflector

  at once i lost my resentment of his
sly assertion of power over my senses
full details i cried

  enough i think to build the ma-
chine itself

  and tfien i saw lisas eyes turned
mournfully upon me as though al-
ready she bade me good-bye

       chapter xii
       the new reflector

even if i could i do not think i
would set down exact details of a
machine which is so apt to cause trou-
ble as the one which guaracco had re-
trieved in theory from the waste places
of my mind the fact is he kept the
plans to himself and questioned me
only now and then sometimes hyp-
notizing me for the questions some-
times not and there were bits of sci-
ence which even he could not digest

  these exact measurements of the
steel frame parts how can we achieve
them he would ask you tell me
in your sleep of micrometers yet how

can we design a micrometer how
even knowing its principle can we
make it without proper tools how
was the first micrometer made

  automatic lathes alloy charts and
welding torches were equally unob-
tainable guaracco did the next best
thing he sought out a master sword-
smith and in some adroit vay-i think
his witch-cult helped him-bound the
fellow to his service by terror and awe
this craftsman with all his tools and
materials he transported to the coun-
try estate and there set him to work
painstakingly shaping the metal skel-
eton of the reflector mechanism

  electrical engineering guaracco
learned from the ground up here
once agaih i must needs be hypno-
tized and my subconscious mind
probed my partner began with sticks
of sealing wax and glass rods rubbing
them with fur or silk and studying
the effects of the static charges from
that he progressed to what i was able
to remember as a leyden jar con-
trived by his own cunning hands after
several unsuccessful trials finally
came simple batteries but here he kept
back from me the knowledge he had
mined from my own inhibited mem-
ory he refused to tell the acids and
metals involved

  when i insisted interruption came
-a messenger from lorenzo asking
how i progressed with the flying
machine

  you reminded him i accused
guaracco in private

  how ungrateful you are leo he
snickered unabashedly fingering his
red beard go to florence and make
your report i shall work here in our
laboratory and promise you that i will
have progress to show when you
return

  to florence perforce i went lo-
renzo received me with some im-
patience in his frescoed audience
chamber at the palace

  well young sir what of the wings
you were making he demanded i
gave you and guaracco money for your
experiments and it is high time you
made me some return

  i exhibited my small models all that
i had to show since the breaking of
twice in time



my first wings he was interested
but not completely satisfied and i re-
gretted having mentioned aviation to
him yet i knew men could fly i
remembered seeing them in tbat age
whence i came and which itself was
yet to come-men flying singly or in
parties with the aid of great spread-
pinioned contrivances

  meanwhile lorenzo was giving me
orders

  i shall see this device take shape
under my own eyes at my villa in
fiesole is a great guest house go
you thither set up your shop and have
sent to you all that you need work
where i can watch

  i bowed acceptance and went to
fiesole there messengers brought
me the remains of my wings and rud-
der also more leather silk and staves
while lisa came at my urgent plea to
help with the sewing she made a
considerable impression on the vari-
ous guests who thronged lorenzos
villa botticelli wanted to paint her
poliziano wrote six sonnets about her
giuliano spoke so courtly to her that
simonettas eyes took on a green glow
and to a certain captain of merce-
naries a spaniard named hernando
villareal i was forced to voice a
warning

he young lady is working on
my machine i told him at
my wish and under my protection
she does not welcome your pressing
attentions

  by gods blood he sneered we
were walking in a grove of poplars
to which i had drawn him for privacy
i think ser leo that it is you who
find the situation unwelcome

  i do not like it either if that will
content you

  he caressed his long moustache of
black silk now nay it does not con-
tent me a whit i shall say to her what
i please whenever  please

  few words are best i made reply
if you speak to her again i shall de-
prive your company of its captain
and i turned and walked away

  he was in a towering rage and made
haste in search of a friend to bear me
a formal defiance the first he met

was giuliano who had not forgotten
the cudgeling i had given him and the
friendship he had sworn giuliano in-
formed the spaniard that i was the
most dangerous antagonist in chris-
tendom in whose hands a wand was
worse than a sword and a sword itself
a finger of fate whereat captain
hernando villareal left fiesole the
same day indeed left florence and
i never heard speak of him again

  when my wings were completely re-
paired and improved i made a second
attempt springing from the eaves of
the guest house while lorenzo and his
friends watched again i failed badly
tumbling aslant through the air but
this time i managed to land upright on
my feet only spraining my ankle my
wings and other harness remained un-
damaged and i was not distressed by
guaraccos ironic laughter

  i count myself lucky i said and
giuliano ran out to support my limp-
ing steps my ankle will mend of
itself but my wings being broken
would take much more labor and time
you have not a complete loss of
labor to show lorenzo was consid-
erate enough to say you came to
ground a good ten paces beyond the
house farther than you might have
leaped unaided

  and had you leaped without wings
you would have had worse hurt than
your ankle added giuliano though
he had first disputed my theory of
mans ability to fly for those two
moments you were above ground me-
thought i saw your fabric hold you
aloft it broke your fall at least
this encouragement heartened me
i shall yet succeed i made bold to
say while a physician plucked the
shoe from my injured foot it is not
the fault of my theory nor the weak-
ness of my arms i must learn as a
fledgling bird learns

  but my sprained ankle kept me for
days at fiesole where i could practice
no art save lute playing and repartee
among those silken courtiers lisa in-
sisted on remaining with me most
prettily concerned over my injury
after a day or so guaracco appeared
with some of his healing salves to
care for me with the apparent solid-


startling stories

tude of a kinsman to bow and utter

compliments to the ladies to discuss
poetry with poliziano weapons with
giuliano science and government
with lorenzo

  i submit that my young cousin
leo makes progress with his flying
he told the company who can hold
these first failures against him can
he learn as a science in a few days
the behavior that has been a born in-
stinct of birds since the creation

ith more such talk guaracco
helped to convince lorenzo
that i should continue my labors in
the field of aviation i came to realize
that it was to guaraccos interest that
i do so he wanted me to stay out of
his way he was carefully arranging
that i not re-learn too much of the
science i remembered only when in a
trance

  the rest of that summer i was able
to put off a third experiment with my
wings-not that i did not want to fly
but that i dreaded failing and falling
again before the eyes of my patron
during the winter i achieved several
substitute offerings these included
a plan for draining some nearby
swamps which lorenzo approved but
did not act upon at once a brief writ-
ten outline of a new system of sword
play for the palace guardsmen which
lorenzo in high good humor caused
me to demonstrate upon two very sur-
prised and glum fencing-masters and
a suggestion rather vague about the
use and purpose of antiseptics at
which lorenzo laughed and which i
could not demonstrate at all

  i made several attempts at fashion-
ing both a microscope and a telescope
but i did not understand the accurate
grinding of lenses and nobody was
skillful enough to show me also
even when i secured from andrea
verrocchios spectacle maker a pair of
indifferent lenses that would serve i
could not bring them into proper re-
lationship in a tube

  one thing i remembered well from
my century or rather the one before
it was mark twaihs pleasant novel
about the connecticut yankee in king
arthurs court i was failing signally

to duplicate the exploits of that hard-
headed and blithl hero perhaps the
yankee being an adroit and impas-
sioned mechanic knew the principles
of all things from the ground up

  my science first of all had been
sketchy and too derived second i
had been too interested in art so that
my less loved studies in chemistry
engineering and physics had been
shoved too far back in that now
clouded brain of mine without
guaraccos hypnotism hardly any-
thing of real complex practicality
could be evoked and with guaraccos
hypnotism i was unable to see or ap-
preciate the very things i was caused
to remember

  poor andrea verrocchio who had
hoped for so much from my drawing
dared to shake his untidy head over
these scientific gropings of mine

  his magnificence will ruin a mas-
ter painter to make a convenient phi-
losopher he mourned and it was
true that i had little or no opportunity
that winter to paint the picture i had
once visioned as my footprint in the
sands of renaissance time

  as for the time reflector which
guaracco worked on with phenomenal
energy and understanding it took
form and power as the cold weather
passed us by among the things it
lacked was a piece of alum large
enough to make a lens but the most
notable alum mines of our knowledge
were not far away-fifty miles to the
southwest in the ancient town of
volterra

  at that time however the volter-
rans chose to refuse any trade or
tribute to lorenzo even to defy him
it began to look as if the only alum we
could get must be secured by theft or
force

      chapter xiii
      the fate of volterra

here was indeed what seemed
a full stop to our hopes for com-
pleting the mechanism i could think
of nowhere to get alum in a large
twice in time



enough portion but in a mine true
crystals may be built or fed but i did
not know how and the only available
mine was the one at volterra

  that defiant city was a small one
but plucky and proud with splendid
defenses as i mused into my mind
drifted a few lines of a poem i had
heard very often in my other exist-
ence

        lordly volterra
     where stands the far-famed hold

     piled high by hands of giants
     for god-like kings of old

  whether volterras defenses were
giant-built and god-begun i cannot
say but they were tremendously old
and strong what i was to see of them
walls of rough-cut stone that were
said to go back to ancient etruscan
times the city thus enclosed stood
upon a huge olive-clad height from
which the sea was visible a score of
miles distant near at hand opened
the dark mouths of the alum mines
which were so suddenly forbidden to
us in fact the volterrans forcibly
ejected certain florentine commis-
sioners who claimed a tribute for
lorenzo

  his magnificence undoubtedly
meant what he had once told me about
wishing to avoid war as costly danger-
ous and ignoble but this was too loud
a challenge for even his considerable
patience in the spring of  he
called a meeting of the signoria-the
lot-chosen body of citizens who acted
as public council-for discussion of
the problem it so happened that
guaracco himself a florentine resi-
dent by virtue of that house near ver-
rocchios bottega was a member of this
jury-like group of governors and
present at the meeting

  i too would have liked to attend
but it was impossible lorenzo had
called for a secret session-proof of
his concern over the matter all i
knew was that one of the signoria a
conservative old fellow by the name of
tomasco soderino was intending to
speak strongly for conciliation and

   these lines are from horatius at the bridge
by thomas babington macauley the alum mines
referred to are still workable

peace perhaps he could restore
friendship with the volterrans make
it possible for me to secure my alum

  i wished lisa were there to talk
serenely and pleasantly to me but
with guaraccos permission she was
visiting a friend the abbess of a con-
vent near venice

  the meeting lasted all morning and
all afternoon and at the end of it
guaracco came to seek me at ver-
rocchios

  it is all settled he informed me
grinning triumphantly

  settled i repeated peace you
mean

  war he replied we take your
needful alum by force

  i felt a little shocked but soder-
ino was going to-

  aye and he did guaracco antici-
pated the end of the sentence
bleated about soft answers to turn
away volterran wrath bleated for
hours i had an answer ready i told
lorenzo that we could not make your
flying machine without alum and
plenty of it

  alum is not for the flying ma-
chine i protested but for the time
reflector

  he gestured idly with a big hand
do you not think i know boy but
we need alum and what matter under
which pretext we get it lorenzo is
obsessed with desire to see men fly
my word was the final ounce in the
balance to make him decide for war
after that things moved fast in
florence because word arrived that
the town of volterra had employed a
round thousand tough mercenaries to
defend her ancient walls lorenzo
immediately gathered four times that
number of troops and as their com-
mander engaged federigo durbino
one of the most noteworthy soldiers
of the italian peninsula

he did not deign to take command
himself and restrained the
younger and more fiery giuliano from

   	this famous general of mercenaries later com-
manded an army that fought against lorenzo war
to these soldiers of fortune was a game and a business
there was no more lasting enmity between such mer-
cenaries than there is today between lawyers who may
have opposed each other in lawsuits


startling stories

volunteering to lead the mounted
lancers but the brothers did lead the
force in procession through the chief
streets of the city

  to me that glittering sepectacle was
somehow ironic the cavalry was for
the most part french and navarrese
the pike-trailing infantry largely
swiss and swabian the crossbow com-
panies from sicily the artillery and
seige train spanish and the whole
cosmopolitan host sprinkled here and
there with scots hungarians eng-
lishmen and moors

  if any element was really missing
it was florentine

  yet that was the way the city-states
of italy fought-not with their own
blood but with professional adven-
turers perhaps something can be
said for the system battles lacked
the extreme ferocity of deadly enmity
for opposing generals were often old
friends and comrades in arms who
were willing to win or lose so to
speak on points at any rate the
florentine shopkeepers and artisans
seemed pleased and cheered those for-
eign soldiers as loudly as though a
force of native tuscans was marching
away to war

  guaracco as leader of the party
that advocated strife went to the
palace for permission to accompany
the mercenaries i was with him as
he found lorenzo writing busily at
his desk in the audience chamber

  go if you will the ruler told
guaracco without raising his eyes
from the page i trust that this cam-
paign is final

  you mean destruction of vol-
terra prompted guaracco like a
lawyer wrenching an admission from
a witness

  lorenzo seemed to hear him only
by half that physician is often
most cruel he murmured as he re-
sumed writing what looked to be a
verse perhaps a sonnet who appears
most compassionate

  to this moment i am sure that what
he said was being fitted into his poem
and had nothing to do with the cam-
paign even if i am wrong it was a
most equivocal answer but guaracco
bowed as though he had received

specific and welcome orders then he
hurried away

  perhaps i should have gone with
him then but i had no stomach for
battle i felt some uneasy guilt be-
cause with federigo durbinos train
of seige ordnance went my multiple-
cannon arrangement for battering
down walls and many of the crossbow-
men carried weapons with guaraccos
lever improvement which i had clari-
fied in a sketch

  a day i lingered in the town which
buzzed with excitement about the
campaign a whole night i lay wake-
ful in the cell-like room i still kept
at verrocchios bottega something
indefinable made me woefully nervous
dawn had barely become bright be-
fore i dressed drew on thigh-boots
and leather riding-coat girded myself
with a sword and hurried to where my
gray horse was stabled

   it was as if a voice called me to vol-
terra

   yet for all my strangely risen anxi-
ety i could not ride my poor horse to
death i did no more than thirty-five
miles the first day stopping the night
at a peasants hut when in the morn-
ing i continued before i had ridden an
hour i met another horseman gallop-
ing in the direction of florence he
was a half-armored french lancer
with the velvet-edged sleeves of an un-
der officer also he was three-quar-
ters drunk and waved a grubby wine
bottle at me

  way way he bawled i bear
messages to lorenzo

but i spurred forward and man-
aged to seize his bridle

  tell me i said earnestly how
goes the fighting at volterra

  he started to laugh and finished by
hiccoughing fighting he echoed
scornfully now nay there was no
fighting

- hows that i persisted

  we marched under the walls of the
town and bade them surrender
and-he broke off to swig wine-
and they did more gulping laugh-
ter over something he deemed a joke
now let me ride on with my dis-
patches young sir
twice in time



  one word more i begged but he
struck at me with the bottle

  it was of stone and heavy but i
flung up my forearm to save my head
and sustained only a musty drenching
with a prick of the spur i forced my
gray horse close against his mount
shifting my hand from his bridle to his
collar and with the other hand i
wrenched the bottle away from him

  why is the army not returning i
demanded and shook him hard

  he lost his fierceness but not his joy
over what had happened

  you cannot guess he flung back
with a soldiers contempt for one who
does not understand military routine
the lads are plundering what else
so should i be plundering if-

  i pushed the wine bottle back into
his fist and let him go with whip and
spur i sped on my way

  but when i arrived i was too late
even if i had had the power and
knowledge to divert that misdeed

  volterra gushed flame from within
her walls around the town capered
the victorious troops some of them
drunker than the courier i had met
others staggering under burdens of
loot even from afar i heard yells and
laughter the camp a great field of
tents beneath the hill that supported
the town was almost deserted and
into it i spurred by chance i came
almost at once to the commanders pa-
vilion and there i found federigo
durbino sitting alone

  he slouched forward on his folding
chair his long black-tufted chin
clutched in a hard hand his face was
as somber as his armor was bright he

glared up as i swung out of the saddle

  you come with dispatches from
florence i make no doubt he
growled ride back and tell that
blood-drinker lorenzo that i will
never draw sword for him again not
if he seek to buy me with all the treas-
ure of croesus

  what is this drivel i snapped
back is not this atrocity your bid-
ding in my revulsion i forgot that
i was calling to account the foremost
soldier of the peninsula but he only
shook his head

  not my bidding lorenzos i-i
have a reputation as a gentleman and
a merciful christian

  to be sure it was lorenzos bid-
ding said a voice behind me a voice
that often had a way of breaking in on
conversations you my dear young
cousin heard lorenzo speak to me
give me a message

  i whirled upon guaracco thrusting
my angry face into his

  you dared order this pillage and
destruction as though you were lo-
renzos agent

  aye that he admitted with the ut-
most good cheer you can bear me
witness before ser federigo his
magnificence was plain that physi-
cian is often most cruel- 

  so you interpreted his thoughtless
speech you murdering dog i almost
choked and out of my scabbard i
swept my blade draw before i cut
you down and rid earth of your eter-
nal deviltry

the red beard rustled in his old
smile of mockery i have no sword

lfeo he said as though in chiding re-
minder i bear only-this

from under the fringe of his
mantle his hand stole into view
with his self-invented pistol ready
cocked even at that i might have
fallen upon him and forced him to
shoot perhaps killing me but federi-
go durbino who did not recognize
that deadly little weapon for what it
was sprang up and caught my arm

  do not add one more murder to this
massacre young sir he begged me
it is possible that ser guaracco truly
misunderstood yet- he turned
away somehow i must stop these
fiends at their hells work

  left alone with me guaracco
stepped warily out of my reach pistol
still leveled it is true that i urged
lorenzos words upon the army and it
was none too loth to sack the town i
have even taken a piece of loot myself
come and see

  at some time during that speech he
had brought his other hand into view
something gleamed softly and slyly
between thumb and finger-his great
lustrous pearl full of spells

  i fought against its power as against
a crushing weight and indeed i did
not lose my wits but i grew tremu-
lous and vague of thought and let him
coax me to sheathe my sword

  come and see he repeated and i
went with him slowly and a little
drunkenly to a tent not far from the
commanders

  and there he showed me what he
had seized from some volterran shop
or warehouse a great soapy block of
alum reflecting subdued gray and blue
lights lay upon a length of canvas it
was almost exactly cubical and a good
yard along the edge

  i knew that i must get hold of this
piece guaracco told me and so i
passed on lorenzos orders you must
not blame me leo if i show scientific
zeal

  some worse motive had really
caused him to start the cruelties but i
gazed at the greasy-looking crystal
and its light seemed to drive out some
of his spell in it i saw even a gleam
of hope it would help me to a com-

pletion of the time reflector then i
would be quit of the renaissance its
frustrations and fantasies above all
i would be quit of the abominable gua-

almost-

lyow if ever i can offer proof that
this is not fiction if it were and
i were the hero i would have tried to
slaughter guaracco there in the camp
before sacked volterra despite his tri-
umphant exhibition of the mammoth
alum-crystal despite his ready ex-
planations despite the pistol he kept
ready in his hand that would have
been the honorable the courageous
the dramatic course

  but it happens that the story is true
and that i was and am of human clay
for two years guaracco had alter-
nately intimidated and cajoled me
with judicious applications of hyp-
notic influence my ultimate emotion
was only one of hopeful relief if this
be shameful make the most of it

  we left the camp together almost
like friends with some peasant attend-
ants and a two-wheeled cart to carry
the piece of alum we did not go di-
rectly to florence but sought a rather
rough road that took us around and
then to guaraccos house there we
placed the alum with infinite care and
numerous helping hands in the cellar
workshop

  guaracco assuredly knew more
about grinding lenses than i did
probably it was one more twentieth-
century science he had developed
from his hypnotic interviews with my
subconscious self too the alum was
a larger and softer piece of raw mate-
rial than the fragments of glass i had
worked with in one day he roughed
it into shape and in two more with
the help of the swordsmith he made
of it a perfect double-convex lens

gleaming discus that dealt weirdly
with light

chine to be assembled we took our
place in the same upstairs chamber
from which in that twentieth cen-
tury which would now reclaim me i
had vanished the same where my
friend astley waited at my direc-
tion prepared for my return

  i helped to bolt the rods into a
framework and lifted into place gua-
raccos battery a massive but adequate
thing inside a bronze case worked over
in strange bas-reliefs

  i think that case came from the
orient it was to do the work i had
done with many smaller batteries in
my first reflector into sockets fitted
his electric light globes most cun-
ningly wrought-again by guaracco
in secret

  they are not the best he said i
understand and he smiled wispily as
always when he referred to his find-
ings through hypnosis that an ele-
ment called vanadium is the best for
the filaments inside

  it is more than the best-it is nec-
essary i pronounced that much
stuck in my mind

  he shook his head i have used
manganese that i have come to be-
lieve-and again his wispy smile-
is almost as good obtainable too as
vanadium is not he cocked his lus-
trous eyes upward did you not once
predict my dear adopted cousin that
a genoese friend of the vespucci fam-
ily-colombo-would discover a new
world in the west

  i did

not elsewhere we must make this
substance serve

said aloud and so much allowance
for the coming change in calendar
which you predict it was on may
first nineteen thirty-nine that your
friend was to bring in a carcass from
which your structure would be reap-
proximated eh he straightened up
from his tinkering now leo do you
wish to say good-by to lisa

much of this sweet restrained girl
whom i refused as a gift from gua-
racco but to whom my heart turned in
spite of all his speaking her name
wakened certain resolutions i had
made i left the room immediately

  she was lingering in the upper hall
just outside the door dressed in a
girdled gown of blue and a bonnetlike
headdress her dark eyes gleamed
like stars-they were filled with tears

  lisa i called her in a voice i
could not keep steady lisa child
i have come to say-to say-

  farewell she tried to finish for
me and her face drooped down into
hands i could not but catch her in my
arms and kiss her wet cheeks

  dont cry i begged her dont
my dear listen while i swear to
come back to hurry back-

  we shall not meet again lisa
sobbed

  i will come back i insisted
since this second machine remains
here it will take us eventually into the
age from whence i came and then-

  us she repeated trying to under-
stand

  i will rescue you from this cen-
tury and this fantastic world and
chain of sorrows i promised

  guaracco cleared his throat we
looked up and moved apart for his
head was thrusting itself around the
edge of the door

  lisa he said i leave certain
preparations in your hands at this
time tomorrow bring into the room
with the machine a slaughtered calf-

  turning from the girl as guaracco
continued to talk i hurried into the
room and closed the door behind me
i saw that the power of the machine
was turned on the light gleaming
blue-gray through the lens the misty
screen sprung up in the framework
once passed it was  beyond   

  and then i saw that guaracco was
removing the last of his clothes

  what does this mean i demanded
of him

  he confronted me a naked figure
of baskety leanness

  i have decided to make the journey


startling stories

through time instead of you

  but i- the words broke on my
astonished lips

  no arguments said guaracco it
is too late and he sprang into the
midst of the framework and through
the veil of fog

  for a moment i saw him beyond in
the room as fragile as a man of soap-
bubbles less than a ghost i gazed
waiting for him to fade away com-
pletely but his substance thickened
again took back its color i saw the
pink of his skin the red of his beard
the gleam of his abashed eyes he
staggered on the floor as on the deck
of a ship he was still in his own age
the reflector was a failure

  i laughed triumphantly and almost
jauntily and half sprang at him but
he slumped down on a chair still
naked so much gloom had fallen
around and upon him that part of my
anger left me my clenched fists re-
laxed my denouncement stuck in my
throat he had tried to trick me to
shove himself into my own age at my
expense-but it had not worked i
only paraphrased robert burns

  the best-laid plans of mice and
men i taunted go oft astray

he looked up and stared at me for
a full minute-yes at least sixty
seconds-before making any reply

  i can understand your feelings
he muttered then as humbly as a child
caught in a jam closet once more
i thought i had tricked my way
ahead of you but i reap the reward
of my sinful vanity

  i was amazed this was nothing
like guaracco do not tell me i
jeered that you repent

  his hand wrung the point of his
beard is it not permitted the
proudest and foulest wrongdoer to say
that he has done ill his head
bowed almost upon his bare scrawny
knees leo let me make my poor
excuses my heart was full of zeal
for what i should behold and learn
five centuries in the future it would
be to me what heaven is to the true
churchman and now without even a
glimpse-

  at last he rose he held out a

trembling hand he seemed suddenly
grown old and frail

  do not laugh or reproach i have
been deceitful but let me make
amends we shall be true scientists
and philosophers together will you
not forgive and take me as your
friend

  i could not exult over so patently
broken an adversary and his manner
of earnest humility disarmed me i
took his hand at once he straight-
ened up and his voice and bearing
captured some of the old sprightli-
ness

  that is better cousin leo-for we
are kinsmen in taste and direction at
least what wonders shall we not
wreak together the world will hear
of us

  as he spoke a commotion and the
sound of an excited voice came from
below us i being dressed ran down
in place of guaracco

  sandro botticelli stood facing lisa
he was mud-spattered and panting
as from swift riding and his plump
pleasant face full of grave concern

  leo he said at once i risk my
career perhaps my life in warning
you fly and at once

  at once i echoed scowling in
amazement why

  he gestured excitedly do not
bandy words man he scolded me
begone i say lorenzo has signed
a writ for your arrest you are a
doomed man

  my mouth fell open it seemed to
me a good twelve inches

  it is because of what happened at
volterra botticelli plunged on
that town was sacked because of
you lorenzo wanted alum for your
flying machine

  aye and i got alum-

  but you did not make a flying
machine with it criticism has flamed
up over the treatment of the volter-
rans and lorenzo needs a scapegoat
when guaracco informed him that
you had used it deceitfully for
another purpose-

  guaracco i roared

  i saw his plan now to usurp my
place at the time reflector leaving
me to imprisonment perhaps death
twice in time



on a trumped-up charge i took a step
toward the stairs for i wanted that
scoundrels blood

but botticelli came hurrying after
me and caught my arm

i hear galloping hoofs leo the
officers are coming run i tell you
run

at that moment the door burst open
and two officers rushed in

chapter xv

santi pelagrini

deliberately i gazed at the
men who had entered so uncere-
moniously

  you are officers i demanded
you are to arrest me  where is your
warrant

  here it is

  the chief of them drew his sword
i was unarmed having laid aside even
my dagger for the attempt to pass
through time resistance was useless
and i spoke only to save poor botti-
celli from possible punishment for
riding to warn me

  you will get no reward after all

i addressed him with simulated spite-
fulness these gentlemen will take
me to lorenzo not you its well for
you that they came your effort to ar-
rest me might have wound up in your
getting hurt i advise you to stick
to paint daubing ser sandro and not
to play catchpoll again

  he stared at me in pained surprise
then in grateful understanding i
walked out closely guarded by the
patrol and was mounted upon a spare
horse then we started-but away
from florence

  did not the magnificent send you
to seize me i demanded of the
leader take me before him that my
case may be heard

  they did not reply to that or to
other demands we went southeast
mile after mile leaving the good main
road for shorter and rougher
stretches once again i asked where
we were going and what my fate
would be and once again i was un-

answered we stopped that night at a
little house where a grape grower
gave us bread and cheese and wine
and subsequently shelter i slept in
front of the fireplace with the men
standing watch over me in turn

  by mid-morning of the next day we
rode into the seaport of rimini and
straight to the stone wharfs the
leader of our party sent a messenger
to call ashore the captain of a small
lateen-rigged ship riding close in at
anchor he talked aside with this
captain and gave him an official-look-
ing document then i was taken from
my horse and led forward

  go with this ship master ordered
the chief officer

  i protested loudly and one of the
officers gave me a rough shove next
instant i had knocked him down and
the instant after that the others had
swarmed upon me throwing me to
the stones of the wharf and pinioning
me

  before i was put into a skiff to go
to the vessel irons were procured-
broad heavy cuffs connected by a
single link and fastened with coarse
locks and clamped upon my wrists
there was no further sense in resist-
ance i was rowed out hoisted to the
half-deck and placed in a closetlike
compartment off the captains cabin
we sailed at noon

  the captain did deign to tell me a
little of what was to befall

  you are ordered to imprisonment
sir he said at the fortaleza degli
santi pelagrini-the fortress of the
holy pilgrims

  i have never heard of it and said
so

  it is a great grace and service to
heaven the captain elaborated
holy men built it two good centuries
gone for an abbey but the heathen
turk who flouts true belief and seeks
to conquer us all has taken the coast-
line all save this fortress alone be-
cause we would hold our own even in
the teeth of islam it is garrisoned by
the holy pilgrims 

   	this fortress of the holy pilgrims must have
been located off the cooat of albania which cfcuntry
was almost entirely overrun by invading turks during
the fifteenth century though no record of it seems to
exist nor any concerning the order of the holy pil-
grims


startling stories

  he told me about the order of the
holy pilgrims as well they were
military monks not powerful or high-
born like the templars of the knights
of st john but simple monks armed
and trained to fight as he described
them they had been originally a band
of common soldiers who reaching
jerusalem at the high tide of the cru-
sades forsook the world and entered
the church after the ousting of the
christians from the holy land they
bad survived and fought on and now
stubbornly defended the island on
which their fortress-priory stood

and they were to be my jailers it
did me no good to protest my in-
nocence and my right to justice
lorenzos anger stimulated by the
lies of guaracco had caused him to
doom me thus to imprisonment and
forgetfulness without benefit of trial
he or any other ruler of the time was
able to do so putting away a man as
easily as he might put away a book
or a suit of clothes i could be thank-
ful that he had not executed me or
could i

  five days were sailed before a light
breeze south and slightly eastward
over the waters of the adriatic i was
not permitted to go on deck but there
was a latticed port and i saw as
quickly as any lookout the two rakish
galleys with crescent-blazoned ban-
ners that gave us chase on the fifth
day

  for awhile it was a close race and
i thought that i might soon exchange
my enforced idleness in the little
cabin for labor at a galley oar then
guns spoke to our front a cheer went
up from our sailors and we drew nigh
to the defending shores of the island
where stood the fortress of the holy
pilgrims

  i was allowed on deck at last i saw
the island as a rocky protuberance
from the blue ocean its fiattish top
green with growth and but a single
landing place-an arm of the sea ex-
tending almost to the foot of the great
square-towered castle of gray stone
that dominated all points of the rock
a boat was put off with myself the
captain and some sailors to row us

i could see afar off the ullen
turkish galleys

  we came to the mouth of the inlet
and found that it bore two great
lumpish towers of masonry one at
either brink for the stretching of a
chain if enemy were to be held off
a skiff came forward to meet us
rowed by two tanned shaven-headed
men in black serge robes a third
stood upright with his foot on the
thwart a crossbow ready in his hands
its cord was drawn and a bolt ready
in the groove

  who are you he called in a clear
challenging voice

  a christian vessel with a message
and a prisoner for you replied our
captain a jerk of the crossbowmans
shaven skull granted us leave to enter
the inlet i could see that the monks
of the fortress wore each a symbol
on his breast-a black cross outlined
in white with a white cockle-shell at
the center emblematic of the church
and pilgrimage the two boats rowed
inland to a dock of massive mortared
stones where we landed

 one of the monk oarsmen went
swiftly ahead with the papers the cap-
tain had brought while the rest of us
mounted more leisurely the paved
slope that led to the great gate of the
castle i looked to right and left on
the outdoors which i might well be
leaving for a term of years

  there were some goats in a little
herd a series of rock-bordered fields
where monks with looped-up gowns
were hoeing crops apparently of
beans and barley an arbor of grape-
vines and at the few spots where
the steep shores relented enough to al-
low one to reach the seaside parties of
fishermen seined for sardines or
speared for mullet

  the big gateway of collossal tim-
bers fastened with ancient copper
bolts stood open and allowed us to
pass through a courtyard inside
stood a row of black-robed men armed
with spears apparently taking part in
a most unpriestly military drill they

 this chain defense tor a harbor or landing was

long a favorite with fortresses as late as the amer-
ican revolutionary war the british were prevented
from coming up the hudson river by a chain stretched
across at west point
twice in time



were all tanned lean and hard-faced
and handled their pikes with the pre-
cision and discipline of trained sol-
diers which indeed they were into
the castle hall we went then down a
corridor and to a plain windowless
cell lighted by a candle

  father augustino respectfully
called the monk who had conducted
us

someone moved from behind the
plain table of deal planks and
stood up to greet us he was a gaunt
fierce man who wore a robe and sym-
bol in no way differing from the
others yet i knew at once that here
was the master of the priory

  his shoulders rose high and broad
so that he seemed a great black capital
y of a man and his face dark as a
moors was seamed and cross-hatched
with scars his nose had been
smashed flat by some heavy blow the
right corner of his mouth was so
notched that a tooth gleamed through
and his left eyelid lay flat over an
empty socket the sole remaining
eye quested over us with stern ap-
praisal

  the monk stood at attention and
offered the letter that the captain had
brought father augustino opened
and read it quickly then spoke in the
deep voice of practiced command

  go brother pietro and fetch gia-
copo the clerk he shall write to
lorenzo de medici that this prisoner
will be held here as he desires

  the monk made a gesture similar to
a salute and departed as briskly as a
well trained orderly father augus-
tino faced the captain

  will you partake of our humble
hospitality my son

  gladly holy father was the cap-
tains reply i dare not leave my
anchorage under your guns until yon-
der dog galleys of mahound depart in
any case

  the notched mouth spread in a
smile nay they shall depart within
the hour our own war craft will see
to that we have two armed boats of
our own and not a holy pilgrim of us
but is worth three of the best of the
turkish pirates whose feet have fast

hold of hell i shall order a party out
to battle

  he came forth from the cell that did
duty as his office i noticed that he
limped slightly and that around his
lean middle outside the gown was
belted a cross-hilt sword

  is this the prisoner he asked
turning to me prisoner i call upon
you to repent your sin

  i do freely repent all sins that lie
upon my soul father augustino i
replied at once of the sin with
which i stand charged before you i
cannot repent since of it i am entirely
innocent the guilty are those who
falsely procured my imprisonment
he is a lying dog grumbled the
captain but i thought that the scar-
chopped face and single eye of the
prior were lighted up as though he
approved of my boldness

  then another monk arrived with a
sword at his hip and a half-pike upon
his shoulder at father augustinos
order he marched me away upstairs
and along a gallery above

  we came into a corridor lined on
either side with locked doors and full
of a musty sweaty prison smell a
porter burly and black-gowned un-
locked a heavy door of planking for
me and pushed me inside

  my cell was some six feet by ten
with a wooden cot at the inner end
above this was a window not more
than a foot square and blocked by
two crosswise bars the walls were
all of uneven cut stone the mortar
scraped away around each for the
depth of a full inch-the work of
many an idle prisoner there was a
stool a jug for water a wooden refuse
bucket the door that clanged shut
behind me had a wooden sliding panel
through which food could be given
me or slops poured forth into a
gutter

 when i stretched my hands
reached up to the ceiling overhead
and when i knelt on my straw mat-
tress i saw that my window was only
a tunnel through seven feet of wall
i looked out upon a sandy shelf and
beyond that to the sea

  this was my home for heaven and
lorenzo de medici knew how long

chapter xvi
captivity

for one reason alone i pass over
the next six years in a few words
that is because those six years were
empty-heart-breakingly empty

  i was not released from my cell ex-
cept for the reason i shall relate i
knew no passage of time except by
the shifting of the sunlighted patch
on my wall opposite the little win-
dow and by the arrival each noon of
coarse food in a wooden plate and
water in a leather mug this was the
same fare i make no doubt as that of
the monks who were my jailers

  on sundays came a cup of wine and
i could hear the intoning of a mass
then i would make a mark to denote
a weeks passing under the date which
i had scratched in the biggest stone
these weekly marks added into
months and the months into years i
found myself pacing up and down up
and down like a beast in a cage to
break myself of that frantic habit i
spent hours at calesthenic exercises
which did keep me fairly fit and at
sketching with bits of burnt wood
and scratching pictures on the wall
with the tongue of my belt-buckle

  my best effort was a madonna
amusing her haloed son with a flowery
twig as i worked thus i wondered
if the picture would ever be seen by
other eyes than mine i decided that
probably it would the fortress was
old and might last for centuries
i might die in the cell and another
captive replace me a captive who
would look at the work of my hands
and muse idly about the predecessor
who had wrought thus

  nobody spoke to me not even the
monk who thrust in my daily ration
and nobody watched me in the sum-
mer of  my second in the cell i
decided that escape was not impos-
sible

  first i detached a leg of my bed-
stead and with this as a lever worried
the crossbars out of my window they
had been set in mottar and had sharp

points stealthily i began to widen
the narrow aperture working each
night and restoring the bars by day
lest someone look in from the outside
and bring my labors to nought

  after a month i decided my dig-
gings adequate-but they were not
trying to wriggle through i became
jammed in the window tunnel and
there i was forced to stick until a
goat-keeper chasing his charges
around the walls happened to spy my
protruding head it took two mus-
cular friends to drag me back into my
cell and i was marched between them
to father augustino

  the prior spoke sadly upon my
prideful and rebellious nature urged
me to pray for forgiveness and a
softer heart then sentenced me to a
term of bread and water-and a flog-
ging when an attendant came with
a knotted bundle of thongs and laid
them like burning wires upon my
bared back rage swallowed my reason
a sudden jerk freed my wrists from
those who gripped them and i tackled
my flogger threw him heavily and
clutched his throat with both hands
half a dozen of the holy pilgrims as
ready to battle as to pray dragged me
free before i could damage the whip
wielder

  father augustino had watched the
incident with an appraising light in
his single eye

  you refuse to be corrected pro-
nounced he very coldly

  keep your lash for slaves i re-
torted passionately i will die be-
fore i submit

  to my considerable surprise he
nodded understandingly his eye
danced a trifle and his wide lips
smiled revealing other lean white
teeth than the one which showed
through the notch

  be it so he granted in a more
human tone i remit the flogging
but you must be closer penned
brethren put him in the cell below his
old one

they did so the new prison was
smaller and for bed had only a
shelf under the window spread with
musty straw the window itself was
twice in time



cross-barred and looked out upon a
face of hewn rock this part of the
fortress was below ground and a foot-
wide trench was all that gave me air
and light

  gloom and closeness were new bur-
dens upon my soul but i had gained
one advantage-the stern approval of
the prior to him i sent request for a
lamp and pen and paper these were
given me and i had surcease from in-
effable ennui by writing and drawing
among other things i set down in
outline most of the story told here in
full that outline is spread before me
as i write these words and is a check
against my irritably failing memory

  i kept up my exercises too shadow-
boxed on occasion and incised more
pictures upon my wall even so i had
many hours in which to meditate upon
the injustice of lorenzos decree con-
cerning me and upon the things i
would do to guaracco if i ever came
within reach of him of lisa i tried
not to think

  in the fall of  and again two
years later attacks were made upon
the fortress there was cannonading
from the stronghold and in reply
from ships and once an effort was
made to storm us i heard commo-
tion fierce yells the clash of steel
in the end i could hear the austere
soldiers of the church had repulsed
their assailants and for a day the
castle rang with chanted paeans of
praise

  i grew to have a philosophic sym-
pathy with my jailers they acted
upon agreement with lorenzo in im-
prisoning me they confined me
closely only because they must if my
food was plain my bed hard so were
theirs for the rest they were sincere
worshipers and fierce fighters the
world was full of worse people

  thus i reasoned but still it was a
desperate struggle to remain con-
tented and sane i tried to remem-
ber the prisoner of chillon which
had one c two stanzas of comfort for
the captive but it would not come to
mind in any case lord byron would
not write it for a good three hundred
and forty years

  the spring of  saw yet another

attack by enemies a stronger and more
stubborn effort to carry the fortress
of the holy pilgrims i could hear
the battering of a wall close to me and
the overthrow of part of it so hot
was the fight so narrowly balanced
for an hour that the very jailer monk
rushed from the corridor outside my
cell to help defend the ramparts dur-
ing his absence i had time to do a
thing i had long planned to do

  the lamp that lighted me was an
iron saucer with a central clip to hold
aloft the wick i ignited the straw of
my bed and holding one edge of the
lamp saucer in a fold of my jerkin
contrived to heat the opposite edge
red hot then with a loose stone for
a hammer and the bed shelf for an
anvil i pounded reheated and
pounded again until i beat that rim
into a knifelike edge after the bat-
tle the jailer returned but he had not
heard my noisy labors and i began
to whittle at my wooden door

  the planks were thick and sea-
soned almost as hard as iron but i
persevered all that stifling summer
i counted myself lucky when be-
tween one dawn and the next i shaved
away as much as a handful of splin-
ters

  boresome it was and eventually
heart-breaking for my first burrowing
brought me to metal i dug at another
place hoping to avoid such a barrier
but found more more that is of the
same sheet

eventually i had removed al-
most all of the doors inner sur-
face and found myself confronted
with a copper plate a central layer
probably with as much wood outside
as i had already dispesed of my tap-
pings and proddings convinced me
that it was solidly massy except for
the small slide-covered opening for
food

  i am afraid i both cursed and sulked
i had no cutting tools the blunt-
edged piece of glass i used for an oc-
casional shave was far from adequate
even if id had tools-file chisel or
drill-i would not have dared use
them for the noise would attract
guards what then


startling stories

  acid came to mind-sulphuric acid
but where to get it the stones of
my cell were volcanic might contain
sulphides but how could i burn or
distill them even if i got the acid
would not its strong odor bring inves-
tigation i approached the problem
from another viewpoint considering
not the best acid but the most avail-
able

  chilly fall was upon us and the
sharp strong wine was served daily
instead of on sunday only once
again i was inspired

  when my next food was brought i
pleaded for a little vinegar to medi-
cine a chest ailment it was brought
me in a saucer and i steeped in it some
shavings whittled from my door
when they seemed sour enough i
placed them at the bottom of my
wooden bucket into this day after
day i slowly trickled my ration of
wine it produced a greater quantity
of excellent vinegar-at least for
metal-destroying purposes-and after
tasting it i felt sure of my acid acetic
acid perhaps eight or ten percent at
the most

   painfully scrabbling with a spoon in
the trench outside my window i
gained enough clay earth to mix with
water and fashion into clumsy basins
and jars these i cautiously hardened
in another fire and employed to hold
my supply of vinegar as i increased it
also for other things

   for instance i constructed a really
workable distillery-a narrow-
mouthed vase or bottle suspended
above a fire which i fed with chips
from the door and furniture and straw
from my bed as winter came on i
heated vinegar in this and the vapor
passed through a hollow reed which i
cooled with bits of ice from just out-
side my barred window the con-
densed drops i caught in my cup
they were not pure acetic acid but
a liquid with a high content

  these labors lasted for months i
speak of them briefly saying nothing
of the trial and error the ludicrous
failures and the chance successes that
finally made my skill and product ade-
quate at length well after christ-
mas of  i began my attack upon

the copper plate that held me from
freedom

  at the height of my forehead and
again at the height of my knee i con-
structed clay troughs against the
metal these i filled and kept filled
with the acid when the action
proved slight i hit upon the device of
adding salt procured by soaking my
preserved meat then evaporating the
brine to the liquid thus i got a crude
form of hydrochloric acid which made
an appreciable impression i con-
stantly scraped away the weakened
particles of metal and replenished my
supply of salted acid i wrought for
months and finally was rewarded
when the last of the copper along
those two narrow lines was eaten away

  the perpendicular acidulation was
more difficult but i managed it by
fashioning two clay tubes at the edges
of the door open at the top rather
like the covered tunnels built by trop-
ical ants these i filled again and
again sometimes pulling them down
to pry out the digested copper then
building them afresh for new attacks

here too i was successful and
one day in february i was able
to pry away the whole rectangle of
metal within the compass of my four
acid-cut channels there was more
wood beyond but heartened by my tri-
umph i scraped and chiseled until the
door was almost as thin as pasteboard
to the outside view it might appear as
strong as ever

  at mid-day of april   made
my bid for escape

  the attendant came to my door
pushed back the slide and stooped to
thrust in my food i had been waiting
for an hour tense and ready as i
heard him outside i sprang bursting
through the thin wood like a clown
through a paper hoop

  landing on the monks unsuspect-
ing back i whipped an arm beneath
his chin shutting off his breath he
could not cry out and his struggles
availed nothing i choked him until
his limbs grew slack then stripped off
his robe i donned this and pushed
him senseless through the smashed
door into my cell
twice in time



  then i headed down the corridor
cowl over my face his keys in my
hand i unlocked the door at the end
mounted steps and came to an upper
level another corridor i traversed
with measured tread as though deep
in meditation and none challenged me

  i came into the main hall saw the
doorway to the courtyard beyond
would be the open the beach a boat
i would row away they would think
that a brother was fishing after that
i would seek land even among the
turks but a voice spoke at my elbow

  you pass me without saluting
brother

  father augustino he had fallen
into step beside me i lifted a hand
to my hooded brow and his single eye
fastened upon it

  how white your flesh brother i
thought that every monk of our order
was tanned brown by gods sunlight
who are you

  there was nothing for it but battle
i sprang at him

  surprise was on my side i tripped
him and fell heavily upon him but
that old priest-soldier lame and half-
blind was as strong as i as fierce i
clutched and pressed his throat but he
caught my two little fingers in his
hands bent them painfully backward
until i quit the grip 

  his thumbs drove into the inner
sides of my biceps torturing nerves
between the muscles and i rolled free
of him we came up to our feet i
struck him heavily on the jaw and his
one eye blinked but he did not stagger
or flinch

  strongly grappling me around the

waist he rushed me back against a
wall and so held me despite my pum-
meling fists in his face while a dozen
monks swords and axes in hand
rushed in from all directions in an
instant i was secured and father au-
gustino stepped clear of me dabbing
at a trickle of blood from his scarred
nose he panted and grinned as if he
had enjoyed the scrimmage

  heres a stout sinner he growled
never did the blessed angel clip
father jacob more strongly thank
you for the bout my son put him in
my office

  there i was kept under close guard
while the chief stumped away to in-
vestigate he returned after half an
hour and dismissed the guards but
kept his dagger drawn lest i attack
him

  i am amazed at the cunning and
courage and labor of your attempt he
began how did you manage to cut
through the door copper and all

i described my method and he
listened with interest several
times he asked me to amplify my re-
marks at length he smiled

  you have science and inspiration
how great would be your works if
they were turned to honest godly
uses

  being held prisoner i can turn
them only to an effort at escape i re-
plied

  aye that your months of toil so
brilliantly planned and so wearily car-
ried out came to naught within short
minutes a tragedy father au-

gustino paused and meditated then
my son what if i gave you freedom
freedom i echoed him hopefully
within limits of course take you
from that cell and let you live among
us you could work more science
with true materials to aid you instead
of such makeshifts as you fashioned in
prison he gazed at me encourag-
ingly say but the word-swear that
you will not seek to flee from this is-
land-

  i am sorry i broke in but i can-
not so doom myself

  doom yourself but you are now
held by iron bars and guards

  and by a false charge brought
against me by a vile rascal i finished
for him i thank you good father
for your offer but i live only to escape
and to avenge myself i cannot give
you a parole

  he shook his scarred head sadly
going to the door he called his monks

  hither some of you he com-
manded we must find this fellow a
straiter prison still

  a new figure pushed through the
circle of black gowns a man in the
dress of the world all parti-colored
hose and plum-purple mantle with a
gay beard and curling locks plainly
he was a visitor from some italian city

  surely quoth he this is ser leo
the artist and scientist who is held
captive by order of lorenzo the mag-
nificent

  aye that father augustino
nodded you know him

 i know him was the reply
where doth he go now

  to an oubliette i fear from there
he will need wings to rise

  two of the armed brothers had torn
away my disguising robe and now
marched me down steps more steps
to a level of natural rock where no
light shone save a torch one of them
hoisted a great iron trap-door i
looked into a bottle-shaped pit at least
twelve feet deep

  at that moment the upper levels of
the castle wakened to noise-a blown
trumpet a chorus of yells the two
monks turned to look i tightened my
sinews for a desperate fight against
them before i might be hurled into

that tomblike prison a flying figure
came downstairs

  the infidel turks their galleys
blacken the seas come to the de-
fense

  as soon as we lower this captive
into- began one of my guards

  no a bearded face looked over
the black-clad shoulder of the news-
bringer it was the visitor who had
recognized me bring him along he
will help fight

  well thought of came the deep
voice of father augustino higher on
the stairs free every captive who
can bear arms let them fight for
life

  we all raced up the steps together

chapter xvii
defense of the fortress

mounting to battlements
around the upper wall of the
castle we all saw that the sea was in-
deed full of craft there were gal-
leys a full dozen many smaller feluc-
cas and open rowboats swarming as
thick as a school of mullet drums re-
sounded from the larger ships and
horns our own bugles brayed back
defiance

  father augustino was rasping or-
ders like any seasoned captain

  man and load each gun he com-
manded line the walls keep look-
out for where they may land his
eye found me ha wrestler canst
use a sword  he motioned to an aide
who thrust a hilt into my hand you
have fought your fellow christians
overlong fight now against infidels
i shifted the weapon to my left fist
trying its balance at an opposite
rampart stood the man who had rec-
ommended my joining the defense
and to him i made my way

  i do not know you sir though you
know me i said thanks for saving
me from that spiders hole into which
they would have thrown me

  we will speak more of it anon he
pointed to where inside the little har-
bor lay a trim sailing vessel among the
twice in time



boats of the holy pilgrims yonder
is my craft and upon it a fair lady who
must not set foot on this monk-owned
island i pray heaven naught befalls
either of them

  but i showed him where some of our
men strung a heavy chain at the mouth
of the inlet that would prevent the
approach of enemy boats which in any
case sought to storm us from the other
side

  at that point the wall dropped
straight to the sea and had been badly
damaged not long before-perhaps in
the fight a spring ago when i had
heard crumbling of stones the broth-
ers had built it up roughly with broken
masonry and spaded earth faced it
with timbers and logs but it was still
the weak spot of the defenses

  even the stone flooring at the top
had collapsed and was replaced with
planking while instead of an ade-
quate parapet a work of earth-filled
goatskins had been laid in and topped
by a great log nearly a hundred feet
long from this log ran back cross-
pieces lashed on as slanting supports

  here the fire from the galleys was
concentrated round shot tore holes
in the goatskins and let out cascades of
the heaped earth while a blizzard of
arrows and slings picked off such of
the brothers as manned the log-topped
parapet the others crouched low

  they will seek to carry this quar-
ter announced father augustino
sagely limping across to the log

  his gown looped up to kilt length
showed great steel greaves upon his
shins and he had thrown back his cowl
to don a plumeless helmet a bolt
from a crossbow struck his shoulder
then glanced away he must be wear-
ing a steel cuirass under his robe

  aye he called here they come a
hells spawn of boats under cover of
their fellows fire keep down breth-
ren until they mount our wall then
the fire must slacken and we will meet
the unbelievers with an argument they
will understand

  drawing his sword he spat between
big hand and worn hilt

   	a log ol this length wa by no means rare in the
fifteenth century well before the deforestation oi
italy

  i dared look over the log a shoal
of boats swept swiftly toward us from
the galleys boats filled with gesticu-
lating and howling turks i saw the
glitter of their mail the curves of their
flourished scimitars the upward jut of
helmet spikes from their turbans a
moment later a jagged little stone
sang upward and against my forehead
-slung like davids pebble from a
sling like goliath i fell sprawling
on my back half dazed and almost
dropping my sword

ather augustino leaned
farther from his point of vantage
careless of the rain of missiles

  they raise ladders he cried
here they mount he turned to his
followers strike brethren for the
true faith

  i made shift to rise a little shakily
and watched as a line of black-robes
came swiftly forward over the
planked-in floor swords and axes and
halberds at the ready the sound of
firing had ceased from galleyward as
father augustino had predicted a
moment later a yodelling cry rose
from below

   ululululallahuakbar 

  one prolonged bellow of challenge
and of profession then the outer side
of our log was lined with turbaned
bearded heads

  the storming party was upon us
eager for trouble nor could they
have come to a better place to find it

  the holy pilgrims hurled them-
selves upon the attackers calling upon
the names of every saint in the calen-
dar and hawing and thrusting like
fiends instead of clergymen at their
head and in the hottest press nimbly
hobbled father augustino h i s
straight sword playing like a striking
adder against a whole forest of scimi-
tars

  something impelled me in his direc-
tion and in good time for him while
his point wedged in the neck-bone of
one adversary another charged close
and catching him by a fold of his
gown slashed a scimitar viciously at
his head

  the blow was turned by father au-
gustinos helm but its force staggered


startling stories

him and a second effort beat him to his
knee with a whoop the turk lifted
his blade for a third and finishing cut
but at that moment i hurled myself
between my own steel forestalling his

  he was a deep-chested fellow brown
as chocolate with mad foam on his
black beard

  ya nazar ini he snarled ya bn
balb 

  and he fell furiously upon me but
for all his fierceness i was more than
his match my first slicing lunge laid
open his face my second bit into the
side of his neck he collapsed bleed-
ing from nose and mouth to die even
as i turned away

  the surviving turks were reeling
back whipped along by the savage
garrison they tumbled down their
ladders and rowed hurriedly away in
their boats under a new curtain of
shot and arrows

  father augustino was up again
glancing around to estimate the situa-
tion

  we suffered sorely but they suf-
fered worse he commented what
says holy writ blessed be the lord
my strength who teacheth my hands
to war and my fingers to fight  he
turned his eye on me thanks for the
rescue my son yet i make no doubt
that with heavens help i could have
risen and overthrown him whence
will come the next assault

  we found out soon enough three
great galleys moved against the mouth
of our inlet our gun crews toiled
madly but could not batter them back
when the galleys had drawn close a
great throng of little black figures
dived overside and began to swim for
the inlet

  by heaven i see that they carry
axes spoke up my friend the bearded
visitor they will attack the chain
if it is cut they will come in and seize
our ships

  a sortie a sortie yelled father
augustino out brethren and meet
them in the water

  he led the rush downward himself
leaving only the armed prisoners and a
dozen black-robes to hold the upper

 arabic oh christian oh son of a dog
 perhaps spoken by a saracen rover 

ramparts we watched fascinated
from above as the monks burst from
the great gate hurried down to the
waters edge some of them were shot
by crossbows on the galleys but the
greater part reached the water and
swam forward to meet the turks
there was a fierce clumsy melee in
the waves that lapped along either side
of the chain

he brethren triumph pointed
out a monk at my side look
the forgotten of god are retreating
swimming away

  they do so more readily than i had
hoped i replied thinking of the pre-
vious stubborn assault my own words
gave me a new disturbing wonder
what i demanded if it were a false
attack to withdraw us from our own
defense

  even as i spoke i saw that the gal-
leys were pulling away with all their
oars skirting the rocks narrowly and
speeding around to the point from
which the earth-mended wall had once
been stormed

  rally rally i shouted and led
the rush across to the rampart of earth-
bags and log

  it was as i had been inspired to
guess the sea was full of boats again
scores of them rowing swiftly for-
ward to the attack a spatter of shafts
and shot made the few of us who were
left put our heads down

  what is to be done demanded a
wide-eyed brother with a smear of
gore on his chin see their whole
force comes to this side more than the
first time their rush will beat us
back and our comrades outside re-
turning from the chain will not arrive
in time to hold the castle

  stand to the rampart hurl down
their ladders stoutly shouted an
armed captive

  as he leaned forward to suit action
to word a crossbow bolt whacked into
him and he crumpled across the log
dead the rest of us crouched low
swords in hand determining to die
hard

  i found myself kneeling beside one
of the lashed cross-pieces that propped
the great log which was our temporary
twice in time



coping it was none too firm that
cross-piece i judged and again i
was inspired

  hark ye al i cried at the top of
my voice we can save ourselves
form in parties by these cross-pieces
clutch them in your arms if we bear
with all our strength at once it will
force the great log forward and out-
ward 

  to what good demanded another

  to overthrow the ladders as we
cannot with such a fire against us do
not argue friends but do as i say 

  there was no time or hope other-
wise in a trice we formed in half a
dozen knots all crouching or kneeling
our weapons flung down and our arms
wrapped around the cross-timbers

  whoops and execrations rang from
beneath us where the ladders were
being reared from the boat bottoms to
give access to our fortress i felt my
heart race like a drum-roll but kept
my ayes steadily on the parapet where
the spiky ends of the ladders showed

  allahuakbar thundered the en-
emy and again a row of heads shot up
into view

  now i shouted my loudest and
taxed all my muscles to drag forward
on the cross-piece i clutched

  there was a concerted grunt from
every defender as we bore mightily
against the log and as i had dared
hope so it was the mass of timber
slid gratingly forward as a drawer
slides from a bureau with it swayed
the storming ladders so precariously
balanced and toppled a single con-
certed shriek assailed heaven from the
many throats of those who were sud-
denly hurled back down among the
boats and into the surf

  dragging back our timber defense
we cheered each other in wild and
thankful joy

that unexpected reverse gave the
moslems pause-a blessed blessed
pause enough for the return and re-
marshaling of the swimming sortie led
by father augustino he clapped my
shoulder with a hard hand

  you have saved this holy place he
told me and if it were in my power to
free you-

  he turned away to thunder new or-
ders i stood alone for the moment
then a hand clutched my sleeve i
turned to see the bearded man whose
name i did not know but who knew
me the man whose boat was in the
little harbor below

  come he said softly if he can-
not give you liberty i can

  how i demanded hope pound-
ing in my breast

  he did not pause to reply but drew
me with him to the stairs and down
we went unchallenged through the
lower part of the castle and came to
the gate he unfastened it and we
stepped outside

  see he bade me the turkish
boats have all gone around to the other
side hoping to make good that assault
which you foiled now is my time to
flee i have too fast a ship for them to
catch and i will take you along

  i was too amazed and thankful to
speak a moment later we had hur-
ried down sprung aboard his half-
decked sailing vessel and were headed
out for that quarter of the sea just now
unguarded by either holy pilgrim or
infidel turk-the sea beyond which
lay the italy from which i had been
carried captive six years before

      chapter xviii
      return to florence

just as soon as my feet were on
deck my enigmatic friend hustled
me into the cabin where he left me
alone i heard his shouted orders on
deck felt the ship move we sailed
out unchallenged and unchecked and
headed northwest i heard the muffled
noise of a fresh attack on the fortress
but we were not pursued

  after some time the master of the
vessel appeared he offered me a ra-
zor with which i thankfully took my
first decent shave a mirror showed
me my face smooth again but no
longer fresh and boyish my brow was
cleft with a frown mark my nose and
chin had hardened and my eyes blazed
as with challenge and truculence


startling stories

over one temple rose a purple bump
where the turkish slinger had struck
me not a pretty face

  my rescuer was offering me new
clothes i pulled on dark green hose
a velvet doublet and then looked in
surprise at the cloak he offered-a
cloak of florentine scarlet

  why it-it is mine i cried i
wore it before it was given me by-

  by guaracco he supplied yes
from him i took it

  but guaracco caused my imprison-
ment i protested

  he now causes your release was
the answer he knew through spies
that the turks would attack he ar-
ranged that i come to the fortress in
good time for that event with instruc-
tions to help you escape it took but
a word to draw you out of cell and into
the ranks of the defenders after
that- but you will know all anon
stay in this cabin for it would be ill
for any sailor to see you and gabble in
port

   i stayed perforce all that day and
for some days following we talked
no more about my strange rescue and
i could learn nothing at all of the rea-
son for it at last on the morning of
april th we docked peeping
through a porthole i watched the ma-
riners tie us up to the pilings

  i raked the shore with my eyes on
the lookout for guaracco i wondered
what i would find to say to him

  in the midst of this my companion
entered

  here is a fellow-passenger of
yours whom i at last show you he
said

  with him was a slender figure
cloaked and masked as at a carnival
saying nothing this figure handed me
a folded and sealed parchment on the
outside was the address written in
fashion of the time

this to the hand of my
kinsman leo

quickly

quickly

quickly

  wondering i broke the seals and
read

my dear cousin and partner

   do not think me neglectful if i have left
you like a dagger in a sheath until the time
was ripe to use you for the ill you have
known at my hands i now make full amends
i have prospered in florence and power
shall be mine and yours come and aid me
as i shall aid you

                         guaracco

  i looked up again with an exclama-
tion the figure had unmasked and
dropped the cloak it was lisa her
deep dark eyes looked into mine

  i have come to take you back to
florence she said mechanically

  i stared at her and my eyes must
have been like those of a frog

  what is the matter lisa i asked

  because something was the matter
she seemed to move and tilk in a
dream

  i have come to take you back to
florence she said again

guaracco had done it-put his
spell upon her and sent her here
nay he had sent her all the way to that
perilous fortress to assure my own
obedience to his call i gazed at the
letter crumpled it in my hand it was
baleful foreshadowing tricks and
traps

  will you come lisa was asking
me

  she spoke in the measured tone she
might have used when purchasing
meat from a butcher her eyes were
upon me drawing my gaze to them
but they only half knew me

  i could not refuse guaracco had
known as much when he had sent her
after me in this state i felt fear and
rage and mystification but i could not
send her back alone

  come i said and flung my red
mantle around me

  we went ashore another familiar
figure was on the dock-a tiny figure
guaraccos uglier dwarf

  welcome he greeted me softly
our horses are ready at yonder hos-
tlers he silenced my question with
a finger on his twisted lip guaracco
will tell you all trust him

  trust guarcco i did not know
whether to laugh or curse

  we rose swiftly away in the bright-
twice in time



ening morning lisa and the dwarf
and i the horses were good and i
found mine easy to manage for all i
had not put foot in stirrup for six
years lisa must have worn mens
clothes beneath her long cloak for she
rode cross-saddle and she neither
spoke to me nor looked at me the
dwarf led the way hunched on his
mount like a trained monkey

  we took the road that once i had
galloped with lorenzos officers this
time we paused once at an inn where
fresh horses awaited us we changed
to them and took a cup of wine and
some bread and goats cheese as we sat
in our saddles eventually as sunset
came we rode into the valley of the
arno and in the dying daylight i saw
florence yet again a white city caught
midway on the silver cord of the river
with green fields all around

  but as we came near a gun sounded
and the dwarf grumbled that a watch
would be set at the gates for my
sake he said we must not enter there
i might be recognized for all the
change in my appearance

  we turned therefore into the yard
of a waterside house above the city
where our hideous little guide whis-
pered to certain acquaintances of his
we left our horses and boarded a
small barge it dropped down river
with us drifted stealthily within the
walls and under the bridges and came
at last to a wharf where we disem-
barked almost immediately at hand
was a house i knew the house where
guaracco had once offered me the
hand of lisa where he had experi-
mented and quarreled together where
he must now be waiting for me

  we walked along the street that led
to the front door and there at the door
we paused still lisa did not speak

  knock the dwarf bade me

  as i did so i divined the presence
within of a watcher but there was
no response no audible movement
even it was only when lisa
prompted like me by our companion
spoke her name aloud that we heard
a clang of bars and the door opened a
trifle to show a face

  it was guaraccos other dwarf the
handsome one who acted as porter

the ugly little man came close to my
side both of them held drawn
swords and their eyes turning up to
me were bright and hard

 some in whispered the one who
acted as porter they wait for you

i started to speak to lisa but
she was walking around the side of
the house i entered the front hall
to learn what was in store for me

  there stood a sizeable oblong table
littered with papers and men sat in
chairs along its sides seven of them
guaracco alone i knew and he stood
up at the head of the board his face
toward me he did not seem changed
in so much as a red hair of his beard
or a gaunt line of his figure at sight
of me he cried out as if in joy and
bustled around the table to me be-
fore i could move he caught me in his
arms most affectionately

 my cousin my cousin he was
saying and his grin was within six
inches of my face you have come
as i begged to help me in my great
triumph

  his right arm clasping me around
the body had slid under my loosened
mantle now it pressed something
against the middle of my back-some-
thing round and iron-hard the muz-
zle of a gun if i moved quickly or
denied him i would die on the instant

  with that pistol-bearing hand urg-
ing me forward as though he still em-
braced me in loving fashion he led rtie
to the head of the table and there kept
me beside him

 this is my kinsman leo gentle-
men he introduced me to the com-
pany he is the man i told you of
whose wonders you have heard speak
of in times past he has more scien-
tific miracles at his fingertips than all
the saints in the calendar

  i know him said a fragile shifty-
eyed man in black and crimson he
was once pointed out to me at the
palace and it was said that lorenzo
set great store by him

  are you then satisfied guaracco
asked the company with him as our
helper hereafter can we fail

  if he is true to us- offered an-
other
so

startling stories

  i vouch for that promised gua-
racco his gun prodding me

  their silence gave him consent and
he wht on

  all is agreed then by this time
tomorrow night we shall be in full
possession of florence and in a posi-
tion to dictate to tuscany as a whole
the oppressors will have shed their
last drop of blood the magistrates will
speak and act only as we see fit to bid
them

  his embrace relaxed his pistol
ceased to dig into my backbone but i
knew that it was still at the ready in
his hand

  the people asked a thickset man
in a leather doublet his eyes
burned from under black brows the
width of a thumb

  the people will offer no trouble
even if we cannot rouse them gua-
racco returned was it not you
captain montesecco who have had
charge of gathering two thousand
hired soldiers outside the walls

  i had charge and i have done so
replied the man addressed as captain
montesecco it is well we strike at
once ere so many armed men cause
suspicion yet florentines are many
and valiant-

  we can count on many supporters
in the city interrupted the fragile
man in black and crimson we
pazzi have servants and dependents to
the amount of several hundred our
houses are close together in one quar-
ter and a rising of our households
would mean the rising of all that part
of florence

as he mentioned his family name i
was able to identify him as
francesco de pazzi he was one of a
family of florentine bankers not as
rich or powerful as the medici but
quite ambitious

  all of us stand ready he was con-
tinuing with influence men and
arms-all that is but my cousin
guglielmo you ser guaracco ad-
vised against telling him of our plan
guaraccos rufous head nodded
he is married to lorenzos sister
later with his brother-in-law and the
rest out of the way guglielmo will be

glad to join us but now now your
uncle giacopo the head of the pazzi
-what is his temper tqnight

  of course i did not bring him
here said francesco de pazzi for he
has archaic ideas about fair play
howbeit he knows that there is to be
an arising against the medici whom
he has ever hated as upstarts and
thieves he will lead the muster of
our men

  another of the group about the
table gave a little nod of approval he
was tall and high-shouldered a
scraggy-necked fellow in a purple
houppelande and he had a shallow
pinched jaw like a trowel

  what is my task he inquired
eagerly as though concerned lest all
the blood be spilt by other hands

  a task worthy of francesco sal-
viati of pisa guaracco flattered
him i rely upon your eloquence and
courage either may suffice both will
be invincible

  you intend said pazzi to assign
him to the palace

  guaracco nodded i shall put some
of my best blades in your charge
salviati he announced at the ap-
pointed time go to the palazzo pub-
lico where the magistrates live and sit
in judgment look i will draw a dia-
gram

  dipping pen in ink he began to
sketch on a white sheet for all to see
once up the stairs he instructed
you come into a hall there ask the
guard to summon the magistrate of
the day while he is gone let your
men pass through this door which you
will see upon your left hand he
pointed with his pen it leads to an
antechamber large enough for them
all to wait  the magistrate will ar-
rive and you will tell him that liberty
is at hand for florence if he will he
can join us if not call forth your
band to make him see wisdom

  and my assignment prompted
yet another one of three who sat to-
gether at the right hand of guaracco
he was a youngish hook-nosed fellow
in good clothes with a look about him
of fine breeding gone slovenly i
have a sure hand with a dagger mind
i mind it well ser bernardo
twice in time



guaracco said and smiled you and
ser francesco de pazzi will strike
down giuliano and see that he does
not rise again have i your approval
bernardo bandini  it was plain that
he had it and he turned nis smile
toward captain montesecco our
friend the captain promises to deal
lorenzo his death

  and i miss stroke may my sword
arm wither vowed the sturdy sol-
dier

  meanwhile-and guaraccos eyes
slid toward me-we have with us a
fighter the nonpareil of any leo my
kinsman known as luca the admiral
of freebooters who has lashed the
moslems to their kennels for six
years he is famed admired and he
knows more about warfare than any
man living i will place him as our
general

chapter xix
the conspiracy

quite well i knew now why
guaracco had thought to drag
me into his scheme he would serve
himself with my brains and skill as
so often before it was one more item
that made his plot complete even i
within minutes saw how the rebellion
would succeed

  the conspiracy was not for a single
blow but several all accomplished at
the same moment lorenzo and giu-
liano the heads of the medici were to
be assassinated the palazzo publico
would be seized and the officers there
taken into custody by armed men the
adherents of the plotters would rise in
an impressive manner swaying the un-
suspecting and perhaps dissatisfied
citizenry by their cries and promises
and to guard against the forming of
a violent resistance two thousand mer-
cenaries were ready to march into the
city

  it could not fail with the fall of
lorenzos power my exile and danger
would be past yet my paramount
impulse was to cry out against so ruth-
less a measure

  but if i spoke so my life would be
forfeit i would not live to get out
of the room i remained silent while
captain montesecco asked when and
where the medici brothers were to be
struck down

  tomorrow morning said gua-
racco at church

  church repeated the captain
sharply

  aye that tomorrow is sunday
you will remember we cannot be
sure of getting them together at any
other time cardinal riario  is to say
mass at the cathedral which will in-
sure their attendance we will be
ready for them each nearest his man
at the moment when the host is ele-
vated and all attention directed
thither-

  now nay the leather-clad figure
started from the chair monteseccos
black brows lifted into horrified
arches i cannot draw swords at
that holy moment god would be
watching me

  guaracco chuckled and so did
francesco salviati the trowel-jawed
man in purple but montesecco was
not to be laughed out of his impulse

  i have sworn to help he admitted
and i shall do so or my name is not
giovanni battista montesecco i will
command the mercenaries raid the
palace help to rouse the city-but i
cannot and will not do murder in the
cathedral

  the man of blood shows himself
blood-drawn sneered pazzi

  say you so gritted the captain
if you will take a sword in hand
messer francesco you will end up
more blood-drawn than i

  but guaracco caught monteseccos
leather-clad shoulder in a big placat-
ing hand

  none call you coward ser gio-
vanni he assured the mercenary
withdraw this part of it if you will-
none will blame you-and we can use
your talents elsewhere bernardo
bandini you are still ready to deal
with giuliano

   	cardinal riario was a nephew of sixtus iv then
pope ol ron-e some have tried to connect him with
the paiil conspiracy but the great mass of evidence
shows that he had no other conncction than that a
cardinals presence at the cathcdral would insure the
presence of the two brothers medici


startling stories

  guaraccos wise glance shifted to
the two men who had not yet spoken
both were clad in blacjk and their
faces were somber to match

  what do you say antonio maffei
methinks you lived once in volterra
which lorenzo saw fit to sack and de-
stroy

  my mind leaped back to volterra
guaracco had managed its destruction
primarily so as to get a crystal of alum
for our unsuccessful time reflector
but he must have other plans in con-
nection with that apparently sense-
less cruelty for one he had dis-
credited me when i might have been
as a stumbling block

tve was able now also to use the in-
mm cident against lorenzo for
antonio maffei was saying with a
growling relish that the smell of
lorenzo de medicis blood would
smell sweet to the saints in heaven

  he is a devil he garnished the
conceit and merits urging to hell

  your gossip stefano da bagnone
there will help you asked gua-
racco you make a sign of assent
stefano as i take it and i may pro-
vide a third for your dagger party
again he glanced sidelong at me we
need not speak further tonight gen-
tlemen let us meet early on the mor-
row and then to work

  he let them out by a rearward door
of the group he detained francesco
de pazzi for a moment advising him
strongly to keep an eye on captain
montesecco who had turned strangely
squeamish for a professional killer
then when all were gone he wheeled
upon me with a sultry grin of wel-
come

  welcome home boy he cried
fine things are to be our doing
within the twenty-four hours

  murder you mean i flung at him
anarchy riot i walked close to
him lisa under your power of will
brought me hither i demand that you
free her and at once she and i will
depart before another hour is passed

  i think not he said in his fa-
miliar easy manner of a master but i
snarled in scorn

  i am vastly different from the man

you lyingly accused to lorenzo i am
a killer bring on your dwarfs and
see if they frightep me i came here
only to take lisa away and by the
saints i shall do so

  lisa he repeated where is
she

  and i realized that i did not know
i was beforehand with you he
continued i hold her a hostage for
your good will and support yet all
may be well he waved toward a
chair sit down

  i did so and he talked the pazzi
he said powerful and extravagant
were on the verge of bankruptcy
they slavishly sought to work under
him for overthrow of the medici for-
getting that when the overthrowing
was complete guaracco would rule
through them and could in good time
overthrow them also

  florence is as good as mine to-
night he said after florence
other states all italy he beck-
oned come

  he led the way down some rough
stairs to the cellar where we had once
worked together it seemed stacked
with firewood until he kindled a lan-
tern then i saw the stacks were of
weapons

  there were rifles and bayonets
boxes of grenades machine guns
canisters that must hold high explo-
sives and many another baleful thing
toward guaracco i turned a wonder-
ing face and he laughed the old su-
perior laugh

  i quarried these weapons or the
knowledge to make them from that
bemused mind of yours leo i had
two years to delve into your trances
and six more to forge and fashion
what ordinary army could stand
against me

  you have soldiers i asked him
when first you came you saw the
worshipers i governed by tricks of
deviltry those and more like them
will rally at my call to use these arms
after that- but leo you cannot de-
mur longer you and i cannot suc-
ceed without each other

  again he plunged ahead with the
wild sketch of his plans after the
subjugation of italy the subjugation
twice in time



of france and spain a united and sub-
missive europe would toil for guarac-
co its lord of lords cristior co-
lombo would be saught out given his
fleet and sent to america to win its
wealth

  once you fancied such an empire
he reminded me am i not the true
master sorcerer with whom all things
come to pass

  not all things i demurred i re-
member that i told the defeat for such
a master-death it will come to you
his eyes turned frigid seek not
to kill me unless you want to lose
lisa join me and she is yours oth-
erwise i may give her to bernardo
bandini for stabbing giuliano or i
might use her to persuade that over-
godly mercenary montesecco you
can have her only if you are my de-
voted lieutenant

  lisa loves me i said stoutly
only at my bidding my will com-
mands her

  i gazed at him as though i had never
seen him before

  not that i had not known him from
the first day as a dangerous scoundrel
not that i had not always hated and
feared him but at last i knew that i
must not delay he must die for the
sake of lisa and myself and all the
world

  in one motion i bared my sword and
darted it at him he reeled back with
a cry but no blood came my point
had turned against a concealed shirt
of mail he extended his arm dan-
gling the lantern above an open cask

 there is powder inside he
warned attack and-

  i hesitated only a second then
turned at the sound of pattering feet
his two dwarfs were at me ducking
under the sweep of my sword to close
in but i brought down the pommel
of my weapon upon the head of the
hunchback even as he shortened his
own blade to thrust down he fell
and i sprang across him and darted
upstairs

  lisa lisa i cried only the
roared curses of guaracco answered
me he was pursuing a rifle in his
hands

  you cannot catch me i yelled on

inspiration i go back to my prison

  i gained the front door and ran out
away i fled passed verrocchios bot-
tega around a corner to a broader
street and toward the heart of flor-
ence for i had only pretended that
i was fleeing the city

  what now seek lorenzo and warn
him dared i show my face to him
ahead of me loomed the palazzo pub-
lico destined for a stirring scene of
tomorrows uprising i had a sudden
hope and plan

  unbuckling my sword i hid it in a
bush boldly i went to a side door and
knocked a porter opened to me

  i am the locksmith i said i
come to fix the antechamber door

  i heard no orders he temporized
but allowed me to enter and mount the
stairs to the upper floor

  here was a reception hall and a door
opening to the left guaracco had
designated it as an ambush for the
bravos who would follow francesco
salviati i examined its heavy lock
and with my dagger made shift to drag
it partially from the door still
watched by the suspicious porter i
tinkered with its inner works

  now it will serve i told him and
went my way

to all appearances i left the lock
as it had been but i had bent a
spring and pried out a rivet any man
or men going into that room and clos-
ing the door behind could not get out
again without the aid of even a better
locksmith than i

  after that i sought a livery stable
and with a few coins that were left in
my pouch hired a horse somehow i
wheedled my way past the watch at a
gate and made the best time darkness
would allow to the old familiar coun-
try house which guaracco still kept

  a single caretaker opened to my
thunderous knocking without cere-
mony i drew my sword and swore to
cut out his liver if he forestalled me
by word or deed he tremblingly made
submission and i locked him in a
closet then i took a lamp down to
the cellar workshop where guaracco
had tested my scientific knowledge on
our first day of acquaintance


startling stories

  it was in a dusty turmoil but in a
crner among odds and ends of ma-
chinery was what i had hoped to find
-the remains of our unsuccessful
time reflector i checked the battery
found it in bad shape but materials
were at hand to freshen it when i
had restored it to power i procured
salt from the kitchen and mixed a
great basin of brine finally i at-
tached two wires to the terminals of
the battery and thrust their ends into
the liquid

  i	watched carefully electrolysis
commenced the bubbles that rose at
the negative wire would be liberated
hydrogen those at the positive end
were what i wanted from a bench i
brought a glass bottle holding more
than half a gallon filled it with brine
and inverted it above this stream of
bubbles steadily the gas crowded
out the salt water showing greenish
yellow i stoppered the bottle as it
filled then charged a second and a
third finally i drew the wires out
the bottles had earlike rings at their
necks and i strung them on a girdle
under my cloak

  they were now a weapon for me
that guaracco had not dreamed of
for i had produced chlorine gas such
as had poisoned armies in the world
war the war that was still centuries
ahead of me

  as i finished the work sunday
dawned grayly i released the fright-
ened caretaker and rode once more to
florence

chapter xx
t urmoil

wtndoubtedly as i have said

     ii	duomo-saint marys of the
flower-was the second cathedral in
all christendom i was there gas-
bottles and all the next morning be-
fore cardinal riario began to say
mass

  i tried to lose myself among the
throngs of worshipers who strolled
most informally among the banks of
seats in the octagonal choir space be-

neath the great open dome for once
i was glad of the natural darkness
that clung in the cathedral lighted
only by the ornate upper windows

  at the high altar the cardinal young
and handsome for all his high dignity
was intoning the service i found a
shadow beside a carved wooden screen
and tried to shrink my height by bow-
ing my shoulders under my mantle

 more worshipers appeared and
more brave in all the colors and fab-
rics of sabbath costume a tall ruddy
head and beard showed among them-
guaracco i saw at once in my heart
i prayed that he fail to see me and he
did he was looking for other things
and perhaps he believed that i had in-
deed fled florence

  then on the other side of the choir
a flash of blue velvet a smiling hand-
some face it was giuliano de medi-
ci and his arm was linked with that
of francesco de pazzi as though with
a close friend on the other side of
giuliano and a little to the rear
walked bernardo bandini the disso-
lute young gentleman on whom gua-
racco threatened to bestow lisa
would guaracco do so would lisa
consent

  and then someone strolled past me
lorenzo a gorgeous figure in a crim-
son houppelande sword at side chat-
ting with a crooked smiling young
man-agnolo poliziano the poet be-
hind them tense and pale slunk two
dark-clad figures the assassins maffei
and bagnone

  i took a step toward the ruler of
florence i drew in my breath to
shout a warning in the midst of the
holy service i saw guaracco ap-
proaching beyond some chairs

  it was then that the host was ele-
vated at the altar the young cardi-
nals voice rang out the prayerful
words that all unknowing would sig-
nal for violence

  ite missa est

  maffei the vengeful volterran who
was closer to me than bagnone
stepped suddenly forward clutching
at lorenzo his dagger twinkled in

air

   	giuliano was ill on this fatal sunday but fran-
cesco de piizi and bernardo bandini went to hit house
and urged him in a friendly manner to attend mass
twice

  i seemed to move of an involuntary
stimulus had i been a true floren-
tine i would have paused to draw
sword and that would have been too
late to save lorenzo being an amer-
ican and from the twentieth century
i struck with my fist maffei stag-
gered under the blow his thrust went
awry it glanced along lorenzos
neck

  beware your magnificence i
cried and struck maffei again a
roundabout right

  he turned halfway toward me
catching my knuckles on the point of
his chin down he floundered in a
flurry of black robes and i set my
foot on his dagger hand the weapon
clanked on the floor and i kicked it
away

  all had become howling confusion
my gas i saw would not affect only
guaraccos party but the whole con-
gregation i dared not release it at
last i thought to draw my sword

  across the octagonal space chairs
were overturning and horrified people
were scurrying and gesticulating
for a moment i saw giulianos blue
velvet form struggling on the floor
while francesco de pazzi with his
knee on giulianos breast struck vi-
ciously with his dagger other swords
were out on all sides

  down with the medici oppres-
sors i heard guaracco trumpeting

a cheer answered him for the
service had been liberally at-
tended by members of the conspiracy
the cardinal his young eyes wide
with horror was drawing back from
the altar and a priest in black robes
was trying to lead him away maffei
had risen and was running before my
sword-point i turned to see what was
happening to lorenzo

  he had drawn his own sword and
was parrying the wild dagger thrusts
of bagnone but his wound streamed
blood and the terrified poliziano ham-
pered him by clinging to him

  i hurried to them and thrust hard at
bagnone but my stroke was turned
for as guaracco had done the night
before this conspirator wore mail un-
der his gown yet the digging jab

ims  	jts

in time 	tip

 drove him back i gestured
 toward a doorway with my weapon

   is that jthe sacristy i shouted
 gef him in there and bolt thfc door
 giuliano lorenzo was shouting
 back is giuliano safe

   but i gave him an unceremonious
 shove and a moment later poliziano
 had dragged him to the threshold

   down with the medici yelled
 guaracco again

   his voice was near and i faced
 around upon him and half a dozen of
 his supporters who were rushing to
 cut lorenzo off i threw myself in
 their way quickly wadding my cloak
 into a shield and engaged several
 blades at once i heard the clang of
 the door behind me and the shooting
 of the bolts

 medici medici i roared fencing
 off my assailants murder help
 honest men murder is being done
 medici someone echoed and
 never have i heard a sweeter voice

   a robust cavalier in plum-purple
 hurried to my side he too had a
 sword and struck manfully at the con-
 spirators his example fired others
 in a trice the entire floor of the choir
 was a melee of jabbering voices and
 clashing steel

   several armored guardsmen made
 their appearance i saw guaracco
 fleeing i followed suit for i remem-
 bered that lorenzo whose life i had
 just saved had doomed me

    the public square outside the cathe-
 dral was swiftly jamming with people
 some armed and angry others fright-
 ened and mystified all were talking
 at once and nearly all were shouting
 medici medici in this quarter at
 least the people were for their ruler

    a fellow in a jerkin of falding with
 gray hair and a cast in his eye stopped
 me with a fierce clutch even as i
 emerged from the cathedral

    is it true that ser giuliano de me-
 dici is slain he asked

   i fear so i replied i saw him
 struck doyn

   the gray head shook dolefully but
 the one good eye lighted up

   come to the palazzo publico
 young sir the man urged me there
 is good sport there


startling stories

  what sport i asked panting
from the excitement

  salviati and some cutthroats went
up to seize the magistrates but the
most of them were trapped in a room
the door had a spring lock

  joy surged into me my device had
worked

  how then i cried

  some guards and friends of the
medici came and seized the lot he
replied with relish even now they
are being hanged from the windows
like hams on a rafter

fierce as it sounded the news
came gladly to my ears guarac-
cos conspiracy had failed in part at
the cathedral it had failed utterly at
the palace but i had no time for re-
joicing elsewhere in the city was
rising fresh danger

  nay come with me i bade my
new friend i know of better sport
still i raised my voice hark all
true florentines and servants of the
magnificent who will fight for the
medici

  i stoutly called a youth bran-
dishing a cudgel and i came an-
other volunteer i i i chorused
others half a score offered them-
selves in as many seconds

  then follow i said and set off at
a trot for the pazzi quarter

  i now held a bottle of chlorine gas
in each hand the fellows set up a
shout of enthusiasm or excitement
and ran at my heels

  we had not far to run out of a
narrow side street road a man on horse-
back-a square-faced man bright of
eye and straight of back for all the
whiteness of his hair he wore gold-
filigreed armor on chest and legs and
waved a sword armed footmen came
at his heels liberty liberty he
was shouting overthrow the op-
pressors

  he must be giacopo de pazzi the
aged but sturdy head of the rebellious
family behind him were marshalled
the retainers of his house a good hun-
dred-and dangerous looking and
masses of citizenry pressed from other
streets to stare perhaps to join

  there was nothing for it but au-

dacity medici i thundered in re-
turn to the pazzi slogan and flour-
ished one of the gas-bottles as though
it were a battle flag forward loyal
florentines smite the assassins

  my own following set up a shout
and pressed forward with me i had
more adherents than i had thought at
first doubtless we had been reen-
forced by others as we passed along
the street but giacopo de pazzi was
not the man to be daunted he had
come out looking for trouble and
seemed glad to find it yelling a war-
cry he came toward us at a trot

  his horse alone would scatter my
band for we were all afoot i made a
decision and hurled my first gas bot-
tle it burst on the pavement several
yards ahead of the old man and he
checked and stared i ran close and
threw the second

  it smashed even closer to him the
cloud of gas rising and mixing with
the air must have been driven sharply
into his eyes and nose as well as into
the nostrils of his horse the poor
beast snorted and reared giacopo de
pazzi kept his seat with difficulty
coughing he dropped his sword and
clutched at his throat with his hand
a moment later his frightened steed
out of control had sidled into the fore-
most of his own men throwing them
into disorder

  the onlookers knew less of what
had happened than giacopo de pazzi
but he had lost command of the situ-
ation and the balance of approval
tilted from him hoots and jeers rang
in the air

  medici i screamed again

  medici medici echoed back from
all sides

  i hurried almost into the midst of
the pazzi party from my belt i tore
my third and last bottle bomb and
threw it it broke only a few feet
from me and the fumes blinded and
strangled me as well as others i re-
treated as best i might coughing and
dabbing at my tear-filled eyes but
though i could not see that final dose
of irritating gas must have completed
the job of halting the rush to dom-
inate the city

  i heard an increasing hubbub of
twice in time



loud shouts for the medici and when
my vision cleared at last i saw a flash
of armor guardsmen were making
their appearance threatening the pa-
rade with swords and pikes i saw
the foremost armed servants of the
pazzi faltering and drawing back
crumpling the head of the column
some darted to right and left losing
themselves in the crowd

  giacopo de pazzi had recovered
somewhat from his taste of chlorine
he was no coward but he knew when
he was beaten he spurred quickly
around a corner and away before we
could reach him and drag him from
the saddle

  i thought that he might reach the
gates and escape and did not begrudge
him that boon to me he seemed the
least grisly of all that group of ras-
cally plotters 

  an officer of the guard passed close
to me and i hailed him how goes
it at the palace i asked

  the rebels are all taken or slain
he answered his magnificence is
safe and has spoken from a balcony
begging that there be no more butch-
ery and asking that the survivors be
delivered to fair trial he urges peace
even while his tears stream for his
dead brother

  it is not over yet i admonished
him keep watch on the gates some
mercenaries have been gathered there
to help the conspiracy

  they will never enter this city
he assured me

  i turned from him toward the arno
there was one more thing to do and
it lay with me to do it

chapter xxi
the christening

close to the riverside guaraccos
house neved looked so quiet and
yet so forbidding i ran to the door
and tried it from within a voice

   giacopo de pazzi was a simple and decent man
who might not have approved of the entire conspiracy
he was later captured and his mutilated body tossed
into the amo another conspirator bandini was a
lugitive for months but was finally haled back to flor-
ence and hanged from the palazzo publico

challenged me quietly cautiously

  i am from guaracco i called at
once all is lost in the city

  there was a rattling of chains as if
the barrier was being lowered and i
did not wait for the door to open
with my shoulder i bore strongly
against it and it creaked back

  a cry of profane execration greeted
me one of the dwarfs the ugly one
i had stunned the night before swung
up his curved sword but my own
point was quickly in his throat and he
crumpled on the threshold his oaths
dying into a blood-choked gurgle i
hurried inside without waiting for him
to cease struggling

  lisa i shouted as i ran through
room after room lisa where are
you

  leo

  it was muffled little louder than a
whisper but i having come into the
kitchen traced the direction of her
voice she was beneath me in the
floor showed a great cleated hatchway
she must be in the cellar among gua-
raccos stacked weapons seizing the
iron ring that served as handle for the
door i heaved it up light gleamed
from below

  there was no ladder or other way
down but i swung myself into the
hole landing upright on the earthen
cellar floor she was there seated like
a stone figure upon a great chest that
must be full of ammunition beyond
were the stairs that led to the front
of the house her eyes sought mine
in the lantern light

  leo she murmured as softly as
the sigh of wind heard far away you
have come back

  fly away from here i gasped at
her these devils machines and
weapons shall be destroyed within the
minute and we are leaving florence
forever-before guaracco finds us or
lorenzo does either

  but i must stay she protested
as though she reminded me of the ob-
vious i was told to wait

told by guaracco i cried hotly
for it now was manifest to me that he
had bound her to her place by hypno-
tism stronger than shackles
guaracco yes her head dipped


startling stories

a little in agreement he said that
all would be well a new florence
would be built with no oppression

  lies lies i cried passionately
he tried to form himself a devils
kingdom here erected on spilt blood
and corpses i caught her hand
come lisa

  i got her to her feet but it was like
lifting a straw dummy

  i was told to wait leo she said

  my hands seized her shoulders and
i tried to shake her into conscious-
ness

  lisa do you love me or is that
only an illusion too turned on and
off by guaracco like the spigot of a
wine cask

  love you yes she was definite
enough

  then come i say i backed to-
ward the stairs drawing her along
with me she looked ahead and saw
something her eyes widened her
mouth opened to cry out

  leo--danger

  she tore from my grasp and scur-
ried around me so that she was be-
tween me and the stairs i turned on
my heel only swiftly enough to see
what she had seen

guaracco had descended upon
me and his hand was lifted hold-
ing something that gleamed i heard
the bark of an explosion saw a sudden
ghostly puff of smoke and lisa
sagged against me into my arms her
eyes were suddenly bright nd wake-
ful again and her mouth tremblingly
smiled i eased her slackening body
to the floor i knew that she was dead

  do not move leo warned gua-
racco hastily still at the foot of the
stairs he leveled his weapon at me
pointblank this fires six shots it
is one of the guns i made according
to the science i gleaned from you

  it was indeed a revolver his
thumb had drawn up the hammer and
the muzzle stared me between the
eyes i gathered for a spring but
paused i did not fear to die but i
feared that guaracco might live

  you have failed were the first
words i spoke to him

  failed

  his eyes flickered down toward
lisa with his rebellion crumpled
around his head he could still smile in
triumph

  failed i said again lisa was
under your spell but she broke it to
save my life she loved me her love
was more than your dirty conjuring
tricks

  true true he admitted smoothly
and i am glad after all that she did
save your life leo there is still time
and opportunity for us to help each
other

  i curled my lip in contempt but he
went on

  many have died today why should
we if you do not understand leo
look at what else i bring

  his free left hand extended toward
me and between thumb and finger
flashed a globule of rosy-silver light

  it is a pearl he intoned in a new
voice the pearl of sleep leo look
upon it

  i looked i felt my senses sway
but held them firm it was only a
pearl the light did not wax or blur
or brighten i was resisting his spell
it was only a pearl that guaracco held
trying to spellbind me with it but
i stared and would not let it have
power over me

  you are going to sleep leo gua-
racco was intoning to sleep-and
all is well between us

  i gazed my mind at work a way
opened to revenge and victory if i
were cunning slowly stiffly simu-
lating a trance i made a step toward
him he thought himself the winner

  leo leo i am your friend he
tried to din into me i am guaracco
who adopted you as his cousin made
you great and wealthy and you will
be grateful and help guaracco you
will tell lorenfo de medici that gua-
racco too fought to put down this
conspiracy those who can testify
otherwise are dead

  it would have worked had he been
able truly to impose his will i let
him deceive himself and took another
step we were almost within arms
reach of each other the leveled re-
volver was bigger and brighter to my
gaze than the pearl i kept my face
twice in time



gravenly rapt my eyes staring but i
was awake and resolute would he
suspect

once we are believed we can still
work together leo guaracco was in-
sisting plan again and better and
bigger we may yet rule the world
i threw myself upon him

he pulled trigger but my right
hand was upon the revolver
pain bit my thumb that had thrust
itself between breech and hammer and
the firing pin drove deep into the base
of the nail a moment more and i
wrenched it away and flung it behind
me it exploded with the shock and
the bullet sang into the beam over-

two of his fingers soared away and
blood fountained forth

  wait leo he changed his tune
at once i must not die if you ex-
pect to live and-

  i did not expect to live and made
him no answer his sword was up
and i beat it momentarily aside and
slashed at his face quickly he par-
ried but only half-broke the force of
the blow his cheek was laid open
and his beard suddenly gleamed a
deeper red

  the time reflector he yammered
at me on sudden inspiration only
i can show you how to rebuild im-
prove get back to your own age

  he should have saved his breath

head a moment later we had both
drawn swords

  you triple traitor howled gua-
racco parrying my first lunge come
then if you will have death this way
i made no reply but deflected his
riposte-the trick he had learned from
me his chest was exposed to a re-
turn riposte but i knew the mail that
defended it and swept my blade in a
quick arc he got his brow out of
the way with millimeters to spare

  falling back he tried to clutch at
another pistol one of a heap in an
open box but i nicked at his outflung
hand and got home he whimpered

for he was panting and choking his
thrusts were unsteady easy to foil
my digging lunge at his belly while
it did not pierce the chain mail drove
most of the wind out of him it drove
out the fight too he tried to retreat
to the stairs but misjudged and
brought his back against the plank-
faced wall he threw down his sword
and lifted his hands

itself against a stout timber i darted

startling stories

guaracco-his hand was spiked to the
wood by my blade like a big pale spi-
der on a bodkin

  then i let go my hilt and stepped
back i spared no eye to my enemys
plight nor ear to his prayers

  lisa lay still and misty pale but
there was no blood on her calm face
i closed her eyes straightened her
body and folded her hands upon her
quiet breast in her last instant of
life her mouth had fallen into the little
close-lipped smile i had known
kneeling almost to earth i kissed her
once and her face was still warm

  leo leo sobbed guaracco in
shameless entreaty what will you
do

  he was trying to seize my sword
and wrench it away but the point was
tightly wedged in the wood and his
free left hand shorn half in two by
my previous stroke could not grip
the hilt he remained a prisoner

  i let my actions answer him from
its peg i snatched the lantern with
my foot i stirred some straw and rub-
bish into a mass against the foot of a
barrel he saw what i intended

  there is gunpowder in that bar-
rel he shrieked

  i knew it but still i spoke him no
word with all my strength i dashed
the lantern down the glass shattered
the straw blazed up and then i raced
away up the steps behind me fire
gushed up luridly

at the door of the house i almost
trampled upon guaraccos re-
maining dwarf the handsomer one
he stared at me in mute horror then
at the glow behind me he seemed to
read in my face what had happened
for he scuttled past and dived into
that flaming cellar as into a swimming
bath

  master master he screamed

  i gained the street ran along it for
more than a score of paces before the
whole world seemed to turn into thun-
der and lightning i was flung to my
face skinning my cheek on the pave-
ment but i rose and ran on that was
the end of guaraccos house-his
weapons-his dwarf-himself-lisa

  nothing remained for me to do save

  to go and give myself up to loren-
zo   

  in the evening i stood in the
groined frescoed chamber where first
the ruler of florence had given me
audience lorenzo de medici was
seated opposite in his chair of state
across the ebony and ivory table his
collar hung loose over his neck band-
age but otherwise he was the same
lorenzo as ever-alert self-contained
far-thinking

  i am driven to believe all points
of your strange story he said gently
and no one can deny that you have
saved florence and me poliziano
says so and so do the officers of the
guard i grant you full pardon and i
ask you to pardon me it seems that i
drove you away once by my misjudg-
ment it shall not happen again

  i bowed thanks but i could think
only of lisa he read that tragic
thought

  sorrow touches you my friend as
it has touched me my brother died
today as did your sweetheart but
perhaps work will comfort us both
and florence hath need of my rule
and your science

  you are right magnificence i
agreed

  yours will be a great laboratory
he promised aye and a studio of
your own in the gardens of san mar-
co above all honor and safety but
one chief change must be made in
you

  and that

  this matter of your strange jour-
ney from another age which though

i	believe i do not begin to under-
stand it must remain a secret be-
tween us since the death of guarac-
co and your lady lisa you and i alone
know it others might think you a
devils apostle and urge that you be
borne to the stake he paused pursed
his lips as if completing some deci-
sion therefore it is expedient that
we provide you with an ordinary birth
and family among us-a father and
all the rest

  a father i echoed him not com-
prehending

  aye that i know the very man-
an attorney who is in my confidence
twice in time



and who has several children already
if i ask it he will gladly own you as
yet another son the records can be
arranged in various offices to make it
believeable forget that barbarous
unpronounceable surname of yours
the name of the attorney your new
father is piero da vinci

  da vinci

  i sank back into my chair implica-
tions rushing upon me with bewilder-
ing shock and speed

  leave all arrangements to me
said lorenzo it is my peculiar tal-
ent to make perfect all such little
things his bitterly ugly face grew
suddenly beautiful with that warm

smile of his from this day forward
you are leo-no leonardo da vinci

  and i knew the rich life given me
to lead as crown of the age and in-
spiration of ages to come my scien-
tific gropings will show the way to
doctors master engineers my paint-
ings will dazzle nations michelan-
gelo will hate me too much and ra-
phael admire me too much but both
will be the better for my examples

  one greatest picture i shall create
with lagioconda as model to be sure
but preserving the smile and spirit of
lisa mona lisa and i shall die old
and great with kings weeping for me

martian expedition

 captain harrison of the ares ex-
     pedition turned away from the tele-
     scope in the rockets bow

   two weeks more he remarked mars
 only retrogrades for seventy days in all rela-
 tive to the earth weve got to be home-
 ward bound during that period or wait a
 year and a half for old mother earth to catch
 up with us again howd you like to spend
 a winter here

   dick jarvis chemist of the party shivered
 as he looked up from his notebook

   id just as soon spend it in a liquid-air
 tank these eighty-below-zero summer
 nights are plenty for me

   well mused the captain the first suc-
 cessful mars expedition ought to be home
 long before then

   successful if we get home corrected
 jarvis i dont trust these cranky rockets
 walking back from a rocket ride is a new
 sensation to me

   which reminds me returned harrison
 weve got to recover your films if were to
 pull this trip out of the red our shots
 ought to pack em to the doors and the
 broadcast rights too we might even show
 a profit for the academy

   what interests me countered jarvis is
 personal profit im going to grab what
 profit there is and never never get any far-
 ther from earth than a good stratosphere
 planell take me

   ill lay you odds youll be back here year
 after next grinned the cantain youll
 want to vist your pal that t t ostrich
 tweel jarvis tone sobered i wish
 i hadnt lost him i never even had a chance
 to thank him for saving my life

  rocket and salvage those films

 jarvis stared me and leroy why not
 me and schatz an engineer might get us
 there and back if the rocket fizzled

  the captain nodded toward the stern from

 which came blows and guttural expletives

 schatz is going over the insides of the
 ares hell have his hands full until we

 leave its too late for repairs oncc we cast
 off

   and if leroy and i crack up thats our
 last auxiliary

   pick up another ostrich and walk back
 suggested harrison gruffly if you have
 trouble well hunt you out in the ares
 those films are important he turned
 leroy

   the dapper little biologist appeared his
 face questioning

the famous sequel to a martian odyssey


 you and jarvis are to salvage the auxili-
 ary the captain said radio back at half-
 hour intervals

 leroys eyes glistened perhaps we land
 for specimens-no

 land if you want to this golf ball seems
 safe enough

 except for the dream beast muttered



jarvis with a faint shudder say suppose
have a look for tweels home he must
live off there somewhere and hes the most
important thing weve seen on mars

  harrison hesitated all right he de-
cided have a look theres enough food
and water to last a couple of days but
keep in touch with me you saps

 saw every beautiful woman id ever known and all of them pleading for my attention
  jarvis and leroy went through the air-
lock out to the gray plain the thin air
scarcely wanned by the rising sun bit like
needles the two men dropped to a sitting
posture trained acclimatization chambers
back on earth their bodies would soon ac-
commodate themselves to the tenuous air
leroys face as always turned a smothered
blue and jarvis heard his own breath rasp-
ing and rattling in his throat but in five
minutes the discomfort passed they rose
and entered the little auxiliary rocket that
rested beside the black hull of the ares

  the under-jets roared out their fiery
atomic blast harrison watched the projec-
tile trail its flaming way into the south then
turned back to his work

  it was four days before he saw the rocket
again just at evening it flashed out of the
southern heavens easing gently down on the
flaming wings of the under-jets jarvis and
leroy emerged passed through the swiftly
gathering dusk

he surveyed the two jarvis was tattered
and scratched but apparently in better
condition than leroy the little biologist
was pale as the nearer moon that glowed
outside one arm was bandaged in thermo-
skin and his clothes hung in rags but his
eyes were frightened and that was odd le-
roy was no coward or hed never have been
chosen by the academy for the first martian
expedition but the fear in his eyes was
more understandable than that queer fixity of
gaze like one in a trance

  like a chap whos seen heaven and hell
together harrison expressed it to himself

  he was yet to discover how right he was
he assumed a gruff ness as the weary pair sat
down

  youre a fine looking couple i shouldve
known better than to let you wander off
alone he paused is your arm all right
leroy need any treatment

  it s just gashed jarvis answered no
danger of infection leroy says there arent
any microbes on mars

  well exploded the captain lets hear
it then your radio reports sounded screwy
escaped from paradise huh

  i didnt want to give details on the radio
said jarvis soberly youd have thought
wed gone loony

  i think so anyway begin at the begin-
ning

  well began jarvis we got started all
right and flew due south along the same
course id followed last week i was getting
used to this narrow horizon but four miles
away looks eight when youre used to ter-
restrial curvature a little hill looks like a
mountain until youre almost over it

  i know that grunted harrison

  yes but leroy didnt and i spent our
first couple of hours trying to explain it to
him by the time he understood we were
past cimmerium and over xanthus desert
then we crossed the canal with the mud city
and the plaj-e where tweel shot the dream
beast and of course we had to land so le-
roy could practice his biology on the re-
mains the thing was still there no sign
of decay couldnt be without bacterial

forms of life and leroy says mars is sterile
as an operating table

  about a hundred little gray-green bio-
pods had fastened onto the thing and were
growing and branching leroy found a stick
and knocked em off and each branch broke
away and became a biopod crawling around
with the others so he poked around at the
creature while i looked away from it even
dead that rope-armed devil gave me the
creeps and then came the surprise the
thing was part plant

  cest vrai confirmed the biologist its
true

  it was a big cousin of the biopods con-
tinued jarvis leroy figures that all mar-
tian life is neither plant nor animal every-
thing has both natures in it i think hes
right especially when i recall how tweel
rested sticking his beak in the ground and
staying that way all night perhaps his beak
was a root and he got his nourishment that
way

  sounds nutty to me observed harrison
well continued jarvis leroy had to
catch a sample of the walking grass we
were ready to leave when a parade of the
barrel creatures rushed by with their push-
carts they hadnt forgotten me either
they all drummed out we are v-r-r-iends
-ouch just as they had before leroy
wanted to shoot one and cut it up i re-
membered the battle tweel and i had with
them and vetoed the idea but he did hit on
what they did with all the rubbish they gath-
ered

        ade mud-pies i guess grunted the
        captain

  more or less agreed jarvis they use
it for food leroy thinks if theyre part
vegetable theyd want soil with organic re-
mains in it to make it fertile thats why
they ground up sand and biopods and other
growths all together see

  dimly countered harrison how
about the suicides

  leroy had a hunch there too the sui-
cides jump into the grinder when the mix-
ture has too much sand and gravel to adjust
the proportions

  rats said harrison disgustedly why
couldnt they throw in extra branches

  because suicide is easier these crea-
tures cant be judged by earthly standards
they probably dont feel pain and they
havent individuality ants are willing to die
for their ant-hill so are these creatures
so are men observed the captain if it
comes to that

  yes but men arent exactly eager it
takes emotion to work em up to the point of
dying for their country these things do it
all in the days work

  well we took some pictures of the dream
beast and the barrel creatures then we
sailed over xanthus keeping as close to the
meridian of the ares as we could pretty
soon we landed near the pyramid builder
there it was breathing in ippn ftd breath-
ing out bricks as if it had eternity to do it in
-which it has leroy wanted to dissect it
with a boland explosive bullet but i talked
him out of it
  he peeped into the hole on top and nearly
got beaned by the arm coming up for a brick
when he chipped off a few pieces it didnt
disturb the creature a bit he found the
place id chipped and tried to see if there
was any sign of healing he decided he
could tell better in two or three thousand
years so we took a few shots of it and
sailed on

  mid-aftemoon we located the wreck of
my rocket not a thing disturbed we
picked up my films i figured from tweels
pointing south that he lived somewhere near
thyle we judged that the desert we were
in was thyle ii thyle i should be east of
us on a hunch we decided to have a look
at thyle i and away we buzzed

  der motors queried schatz breaking
his long intent silence

  for a wonder we had no trouble karl
your blast worked perfectly so we
hummed along pretty nigh up thyle ii

id seen on mars except the cliffs that
bounded xanthus and thyle ii we flew
over that valley-

  jarvis paused suddenly and shuddered
leroy whose color had begun to return
seemed to pale the chemist resumed

  well the valley looked all right-then
just a gray waste probably full of crawlers
like the others we circled back over the
city say i want to tell you that place was
gigantic at first i thought the size was due
to the nearness of the horizon but it wasnt
that we sailed right over it but the sun
dropped out of sight right then i knew we
were pretty far south-latitude sixty-but i
didnt know just how much night wed have

chapter ii

jbis headed thoth

harrison glanced at a schiaparelli

chart

about sixty eh near what corresponds

    cl lylalaa d

valley of dreams is the sequel to a mar-
tian odyssey the interplanetary story that
revolutionized scientifiction once again we in-
troduce you to stanley g weinbaums unforgettable
group of spatial pioneers-dick jarvis captain harri-
son leroy schatz-and that unpredictable walking
martian mystery tweel

  youll find the alien life-forms presented in this novelet
truly startling    theyre the strangest organisms ever
evolved on any one sphere in the solar system
other-worldly incomprehensible yet lovable these
are but typical creations of the late stanley g wein-
baum
they will remain forever in the hearts and memories
of fantasy followers as will the fame of their creator
who was scientifictions most widely-recognized master

spread out like an orange carpet after
awhile we crossed the gray branch of mare
chronium that bounded it there was thyle
i-same orange-hued desert as its mate we
veered south toward mare australe and
followed the edge of the desert and to-
ward sunset we spotted it

 shpotted echoed schatz vot vas
shpotted

  the desert was spotted-with buildings
not one of the mud cities of the canals al-
though a canal went through it a continua-
tion of the one schiaparelli called ascanius

  we were probably too high to be visible
and we couldnt see anything even with the
glasses it was nearly sunset anyway so we
didnt plan on dropping in we circled the
place the canal went out into mare au-
strale and there glittering in the south
was the melting polar ice-cap off to the
southeast was a valley-the first irregularity

to the antarctic circle youd have about
four hours of night at this season three
months from now youd have none at all
three months echoed jarvis surprised
then he grinned right i forgot the sea-
sons here are twice as long as ours well
we sailed out into the desert about twenty
miles and there we spent the night youre
right about the length of it we had about
four hours of darkness which left us fairly
rested we ate breakfast and called our
location to you

we sailed toward the city from the east
and it loomed up like a range of mountains
lord what a city new york might have
higher buildings chicago probably covers
more ground but for sheer mass those
structures were in a class by themselves
gargantuan there was a queer look about
the place though you know how a ter-
restrial city sprawls out suburbs residential



stanley g weinbaum
sections factory districts parks highways
there was none of that here the city rose
out of the desert as abruptly as a cliff

  the architecture was strange too set-
backs in reverse so a building with a small
base could spread out as it rose would be a
valuable trick in new york but to do it
youd have to transfer martian gravitation
there

  well you cant land a rocket in a city
street so we put down right next to the
canal we took cameras and revolvers and
started for a gap in the wall of masonry
the city was in ruin-abandoned deserted
dead as babylon its empty streets were
deep under sand

  a ruin eh commented harrison how
old

  how could we tell countered jarvis
the next expedition ought to carry an
archeologist-and a philologist too things
weather so slowly here that most of the
buildings might have been put up yesterday
the only aging factors are the erosion of the
wind-and thats negligible in this atmos-
phere-and the cracks caused by changing
temperature and meteorites must crash
down occasionally on the city weve seen
four strike ground right here near the ares

even corrected the captain three
dropped while you were gone

 well damage by meteorites must be
slow anyway my guess at the citys age-
and it may be wrong by a big percentage-
would be fifteen thousand years even thats
older than the late stone age on earth

  so leroy and i crept up to those tre-
mendous buildings feeling like pygmies and
talking in whispers i tell you it was ghostly
walking down that dead and deserted street
we felt like intruders as if the great race
that had built the place might resent our
presence even across a hundred and fifty
centuries it was quiet as a grave but we
kept imagining things and peeping down the
dark lanes between buildings and looking
over our shoulders when we saw occa-
sional openings in those vast walls we ex-
pected to see some horror peering out

  then we reached an edifice with an open
arch we eased a few feet into the dark-
ness and the passage debouched into a colos-
sal hall far above us a little crack let in a
pallid ray of daylight not nearly enough to
light the place- i said something to leroy
and a million thin echoes came out of the
darkness we began to hear other sounds-
slithering rustling noises whispers sounds
like suppressed breathing something black
and silent passed between us and that far-
away crevice of light

  then we saw three little greenish spots
of luminosity in the dusk to our left we
stood staring at them and suddenly they all
shifted at once leroy yelled they were
eyes

  we stopd frozen for a moment leroys
yell reverberated between the distant walls
there were tfitfmblings mutterings and
strange soft laughter the three-eyed thing
moved again then we broke for the door

  we felt better out in the sunlight but
neither of us suggested another look we

   did see the place later and that was queer
   too but youll hear about it when i come to
   it we just loosened our revolvers and
   crept on

    the ghostly street curved and twisted
  and subdivided i kept careful note of our
  directions in that gigantic maze without
  our thermo-skin bags night would finish us
  even if what lurked in the ruins didnt by
  and by i noticed that we were veering back
  toward the canal the giant buildings
  seemed a little less massive than those be-
  hind us though we still felt like a pair of
  ants crawling down broadway at the bank
  of the canal the buildings ended and there
  were only a few dozen ragged stone huts
  we rounded a corner and there was tweel

     i yelled tweel he just stared and then
   i realized that he wasnt tweel but another
   martian of his sort tweels feathery ap-
   pendages were more orange-hued and he
   stood several inches taller than this one
   leroy was sputtering in excitement and the
   martian kept his vicious beak directed at us
   so i stepped forward as peace-maker i re-
   peated tweel very questioningly and
   finally had to give it up we couldnt con-
   nect

    leroy and i walked toward the huts and
  the martian followed us twice he was
  joined by others each time i tried yelling
  tweel at them they just stared at us so
  we ambled on with the three trailing us then
  it suddenly occurred to me that my martian
  accent might be at fault i faced the group
  and tried trilling it out the way tweel him-
  self did t-r-r-rwee-r-rl like that

    and that worked one of them spun his
  head around a full ninety degrees and
  screeched t-r-r-rwee-r-rl like an arrow
  from a bow tweel came sailing over the
  nearer huts to land on his beak in front of
  me

  mman we were glad to see each other

            tweel set up a twittering and chirp-
   ing lltce a farm in summer and went sailing
   up and coming down on his beak i would
   have grabbed his hands only he wouldnt
   keep still long enough

    the other martians and leroy just
  stared tweel stopped bouncing and there
  we were after i d said tweel a couple
  of times and hed said tick we were more
  or less helpless however i suggested that
  he guide us around the place if he werent
  busy i put over the idea by pointing back
  at the buildings and then at him and us

     well apparently he wasnt too busy for
  he set off with us leading the way with one
  of his hundred and fifty-foot nosedives that
  set leroy gasping when we caught up he
  said something like one one two-two
  two four-no no-yes yes-rock-no
  breet that didnt seem to mean anything
  perhaps he was merely running over his
  vocabulary to refresh his memory

    anyway he showed us around he had
  a light in his black peuch good enough for
  small rooms but simply lost in the colossal
  caverns we went through those vast empty
  chambers were a mystery to us they didn t
  seem suitable for living quarters or even for
  commercial purposes they might have


been power-houses but where were the re-
mains of the machinery

  the whole place was a mystery some-
times tweel would show us through a hall
that would have housed an ocean liner hed
seem to swell with pride and we couldnt
make a damn thing of it as a display of
architectural power the city was colossal
as anything else it was just nutty

  but we did see one thing that registered
we came to that same building leroy and i
had entered earlier-the one with the three
eyes in it well we were a little shaky
about going in there but tweel kept say-
ing yes yes yes so we followed him
staring nervously about for the thing that
had watched us that hall was just like the
others full of murmurs slithering noises
and shadowy things slipping away into cor-
ners the three-eyed creature must have
slunk away with the others

  tweel led us along the wall as his light
flashed into an alcove i saw first just an
empty space and there squatting on the
floor i saw-it i a creature as big as a rat
it was gray and huddled startled by our ap-
pearance it had the queerest most devilish
little face-pointed ears or horns and sa-
tanic eyes that seemed to sparkle with a sort
of fiendish intelligence

  tweel saw it too and let out a screech
of anger the creature rose on two pencil-
thin legs and scuttled off with a half-terri-
fied half-defiant squeak it darted into the
darkness too quickly even for tweel as it
ran something waved on its body like a
fluttering cape tweel screeched angrily at
it in genuine rage

wut the thing was gone and then i no-
ticed the weirdest of imaginable de-
tails where it had squatted on the floor was
-a book

 i took a step forward sure enough
there was some sort of inscription on the
pages tweel fumed and whistled in wrath
picked up the volume and slammed it into
place on a shelf full of others

  had the little thing with the fiendish face
been reading or was it simply eating the
pages getting physical nourishment rather
than mental or had the whole thing been
accidental why was tweel so furious

  i did notice that the book was entirely
undamaged nor did i see a damaged book
among any that we handled but i have an
odd hunch that if we knew the secret of the
little cape-clothed imp wed know the mys-
tery of the vast abandoned city and the de-
cay of martian culture

  well tweel quieted down after a while
and led us completely around that tremen-
dous hall it had been a library i think
at least there were thousands upon thou-
sands of those queer black-paged volumes
printed in wavy lines of white there were
pictures too in some and some of these
showed tweels people thats a point of
course it indicates that his race built the
city and printed the books i dont think
the greatest philologist on earth will ever
translate one line of those records they
were made by minds too different from ours

  tweel could read them naturally he



twittered off a few lines and then i took a
few of the books with his permission he
said no no to some and yes yes to
others perhaps he kept back the ones his
people needed or perhaps he let me take
the ones he thought wed understand most
easily i dont know the books are out in
the rocket

  then he held that dim torch of his to-
ward the walls lord what pictures they
stretched up and up into the blackness of
the roof mysterious and gigantic i couldnt
make much of the first wall it seemed to
be a portrayal of a great assembly of tweels
eople perhaps it was meant to symbolize
ociety or government but the next wall
showed creatures at work on a colossal ma-
chine of some sort and that would be in-
dustry or science the back wall had cor-
roded away in part from what we could
see i suspected the scene was meant to
portray art but it was on the fourth wall
that we got the real shock

  i think the symbol was exploration or
discovery this wall was a little plainer
because the moving beam of daylight from
that crack lit up the higher surface and
tweels torch illuminated the lower we
made out a giant seated figure one of the
beaked martians like tweel but with every
limb suggesting heaviness weariness the
arms dropped inertly on the chair the thick
neck bent and the beak rested on the body
as if the creature could scarcely bear its
own weight before it was a queer kneeling
figure at sight of it leroy and i almost
reeled against each other it was appar-
ently a man

  a man bellowed harrison a man you
say

  i said apparently retorted jarvis the
artist had exaggerated the nose almost to
the length of tweels beak but the figure
had black shoulder-length hair instead of
the martian four there were five fingers on
its outstretched hand it was kneeling and
on the ground was a pottery bowl full of
food-offering leroy and i thought wed
gone screwy

  tweel was squeaking and pointing at the
figure and sayingtick tick so he must
have recognized the resemblance it was
leroy who made the important comment
he looked at the martian and said thoth
the god thoth

dfhui confirmed the biologist com-
  u me egypte

  yeah said jarvis like the egyptian
ibis-headed god-the one with the beak
well no sooner did tweel hear the name
thoth than he pointed at himself and said
thoth thoth of course he often did
queer things but we both thought he was
trying to tell us that his race called them-
selves thoth do you see what im getting
at

  i see all right said harrison you
think the martians paid a visit to the egyp-
tians well youre off there wasnt any
egyptian civilization fifteen thousand years
ago

  wrong grinned jarvis its too bad
we havent an archeologist with us but le-
roy tells me that there was a stone-age cul-
ture in egypt then the pre-dynastic civiliza-
tion

  well even so what of it

  plenty the attitude of the martian
heavy and weary-the strain of terrestrial
gravitation leroy tells me thoth wag the
egyptian god of philosophy and the in-
ventor of writing get that

  well ill be hanged but what about the
nose on the egyptian do you mean to tell
me that stone-age egyptians had longer
noses than ordinary men

  of course not dont human beings tend
to relate everything to themselves thats
why dugongs and manatees started the mer-
maid myths-sailors thought they saw hu-
man features on the beasts so the martian
artist drawing either from descriptions or
imperfect photographs naturally exagge-
rated the size of the human nose to a degree
that looked normal to him or anyway
thats my theory

  well itll do as a theory grunted har-
rison what i want to hear is why you two
got back here looking like a couple of year-
before-last birds nests

        chapter iii
        paradise and hell

varvis shuddered again and cast another
 glance at leroy the little biologist was
recovering some of his accustomed poise
but he returned the glance with an echo of
the chemists shudder

  well get to that resumed jarvis
meanwhile ill stick to tweel and his peo-
ple we spent the better part of three days
with them we took pictures of everything
possible i even tried to photograph the
gigantic mural in the library but i dont sup-
pose itll show and thats a pity since its
undoubtedly the most interesting object
weve found on mars at least from a human
viewpoint

  tweel was a very courteous host he
took us to all the points of interest-even
the new water-works

  schatz eyes brightened vater-vorks
for vot

  for the canal naturally they have to
build up a head of water to drive it through
thats obvious jarvis looked at the cap-
tain you told me yourself that to drive
water from the polar caps of mars to the
equator was equivalent to forcing it up a
twenty-mile hill because mars is flattened
at the poles and bulges at the equator just
like earth

  thats true agreed harrison

  well this city was one of the relay sta-
tions to boost the flow their power plant
was the only building that seemed to serve
any useful purpose and that was worth see-
ing i wish youd seen it karl its a sun-
power plant

  harrison and schatz stared

un-power grunted the captain

   thats primitive 

  not as primitive as all that corrected
jarvis the sunlight focused on a queer

cylinder in the center of a big concave mir-
ror and they drew an electric current from
it the juice worked the pumps

  a termocouple  ejaculated schatz with
conviction

  that sounds reasonable you can judge
by the pictures but the queerest was that
the machinery was tended not by tweels
people but by some of the barrel-shaped
creatures like the ones in xanthus

  he gazed around at the faces of his au-
ditors there was no sign of any desire to
comment

  get it at their silence he proceeded
i see you dont leroy figured it out but
whether rightly or wrongly i dont know
he thinks that the barrels and tweels race
have a reciprocal arrangement like-well
like bees and flowers on earth the flowers
give honey for the bees the bees carry
the pollen for the flowers see the bar-
rels tend the works and tweels people build
the canal system

  the xanthus city must have been a
boosting station that explains the mys-
terious machines i saw and leroy be-
lieves further that it isnt an intelligent ar-
rangement-not on the part of the barrels
at least but its been done for so many
thousands of generations that its become
instinctive a tropism like the actions of ants
and bees the creatures have been bred to
it

  nuts observed harrison lets hear
you explain the reason for that big empty
city then

  sure tweels civilization is decadent
thats the reason its a dying race and
theyre an outpost left to tend the source of
the water at the polar cap its the last gasp
of a race that reached a higher peak of cul-
ture than man

  huh said harrison then why are
they dying lack of water

  i dont think so responded the chemist
if my guess at the citys age is right fif-
teen thousand years wouldnt make enough
difference in the water supply-nor a hun-
dred thousand for that matter

  das wasser cut in schatz vere goes
dot

  even a chemist knows that scoffed jar-
vis every time theres a lightning flash on
earth it electrolyzes some water vapor into
hydrogen and oxygen then the hydrogen
escapes into space because gravitation wont
hold it permanently and every time theres
an earthquake some water is lost to the in-
terior slow-but damned certain

  he turned to harrison

  right cap

  right but here of course-no earth-
quakes no thunderstorms-the loss must be
very slow then why is the race dying

  the sun-power plant answers that coun-
tered jarvis lack of fuel lack of power
no more oil left no more coal left no water-
power

  with the limitless energy of the atom
exploded harrison

they dont know about atomic energy
probably never did must have used some
other principle in operating their space ship
then snapped the captain what makes
you rate their intelligence above the human
weve finally cracked the atom

  sure we have we had a clue didnt we
radium and uranium do you think wed
ever have learned how without those ele-
ments wed never even have suspected
that atomic energy existed

  well havent they-

  no they havent youve told me your-
self that mars has only seventy-three per
cent of earths density even a chemist can
see that that means a lack of heavy metals
they didnt have a clue

  even so if they were more advanced
theyd have discovered it anyway

  maybe conceded jarvis im not
claiming that we dont surpass them in some
ways but in others theyre far ahead of
us

  in what for instance

  well socially for one thing

  huh how do you mean

jarvis glanced in turn at each of the
three that faced him he hesitated

  i wonder how you chaps will take this
naturally everybody likes his own system
best he frowned look here on
earth we have three types of society
theres a member of each type right here
schatz lives under a dictatorship leroys a
citizen of the sixth commune in france
harrison and i are americans members of
a democracy there you are-autocracy
democracy communism-the three types of
terrestrial societies tweels people have a
different system

  different what is it

  the one no earthly nation has tried
anarchy	

  anarchy the captain and schatz burst
out together

  thats right

  but- harrison was sputtering what
do you mean theyre ahead of us anarchy
bah

  all right bah retorted jarvis im not
saying it would work for us or for any race
of men but it works for them

  but artarchy the captain was indig-
nant

  well when you come right down to it
argued jarvis defensively anarchy is the
ideal form of government if it works em-
erson said that the best government was that
which governs least and so did wendell
phillips and i think george washington
and you cant have any form of government
which governs less than anarchy which is
no government at all

  but its unnatural the captain was sput-
tering even savage tribes have their chiefs
even a pack of wolves has its leader
that only proves government is a primi-
tive device doesnt it with a perfect race
you wouldnt need it at all government is a
confession that you need laws to restrain
anti-social individuals if there were no anti-
social persons you wouldnt need laws or
police would you

  but youd need government how about
public works wars taxes

  no wars on mars in spite of being named
after the war god the population is too

thin and too scattered besides it takes the
help of every single community to keep the
canal system functioning no taxes be-
cause apparently all individuals cooperate
in building public works no competition
to cause trouble because anybody can help
himself to anything as i said with a per-
fect race government is entirely unneces-
sary

  and do you consider the martians a per-
fect race asked the captain grimly

  not at all but theyve existed so much
longer than man that theyve evolved so-
cially at least to the point where they dont
need government queer isnt it on
earth its the trial of an emotional highly
competitive race in a world of plenty here
its the trial of a quiet friendly race on an
inhospitable world

  oui confirmed the biologist it is
true

  but anarchy grumbled harrison disgust-
edly it would show up on a dizzy half-
dead pill like mars

tll be a good many centuries before
youll have to woy about it on
earth grinned jarvis he resumed his
narrative

  well we wandered through that sepul-
chral city taking pictures of everything
and then-jarvis paused and shuddered-
then i took a look at that valley wed
spotted from the rocket i dont know why
but when we tried to steer tweel in that
direction he set up such a squawking and
screeching that i thought hed gone batty

  if possible jeered harrison

  so we started over there without him
he kept wailing and screaming no no no
tick but that made us the more curious
he sailed over our heads and stuck on his
beak and went through a dozen other an-
tics but we ploughed on finally he gave
up and trudged disconsolately along with us

  the valley wasnt more than a mile south-
east of the city tweel could have covered
the distance in twenty jumps but he lagged
and loitered and kept pointing back at the
city and wailing no no no then hed sail
up into the air and zip down on his beak
directly in front of us and wed have to walk
around him id seen him do lots of crazy
things before of course i was used to them
but it was as plain as print that he didnt
want us to see that valley

  why queried harrison

  you asked why we came back like
tramps said jarvis with a faint shudder
youll learn we plugged along up a low
rocky hill that bounded it as we neared
the top tweel said no breet tick no
breet well those were the words he had
used to describe the silicon monster they
were also the words he had used to tell me
that the image of fancy long the one that
had almost lured me to the dream beast
wasnt real i remembered that but it meant
nothing to me-then

  right after that tweel said you one-
one-two he one-one-two and then i began
to see that was the phrase he had used to
explain the dream beast to tell me that what
i thought the creature thought-to tell me
how the thing lured its victims by their own
desires so i warned leroy it seemed to
me that even the dream beast couldnt be
dangerous if we were warned and expecting
it well i was wrong

  as we reached the crest tweel spun his
head completely around so his feet were
forward but his eyes looked backward as if
he feared to gaze into the valley leroy
and i stared out over it just a gray waste
like this around us with the gleam of the
south polar cap far beyond its southern rim
thats what it was one second the next
it was-paradise

  what exclaimed the captain

  jarvis turned to leroy

  can you describe it

  the biologist waved helpless hands

  cest impossible he whispered it
me rend muet

  it strikes me dumb too muttered jar-
vis i dont know how to tell it im a
chemist not a poet paradise is as good a
word as i can think of and thats not at all
right it was paradise and hell in one
will you talk sense growled harrison
as much of it as makes sense how
would you like to see all your dreams made
real everything youd ever wanted there
for the taking

  id like it fine said the captain

 youre welcome then not only your
noble desires remember every good im-
pulse yes but also every nasty little wish
every vicious thought everything youd ever
desired good or bad the dream beasts are
marvelous salesmen but they lack the moral
sense

chapter iv

the dream beasts

the captain looked around him in amaze-
ment then asked

  the dream beasts

  yes it was a valley of them i saw a
dozen fancy longs in every costume id
ever admired on her and some i must have
imagined i saw every beautiful woman ive
ever known and all of them pleading for
my attention i saw every lovely place id
ever wanted to be all packed queerly into
that little vailey and i saw-other things
he shook his head soberly it wasnt all
exactly pretty lord how much of the beast
is left in us i suppose if every man alive
could have one look at that weird valley and
could see just once what nastiness is hidden
in him-well the world might gain by it i
thanked heaven afterward that leroy-and
even tweel-saw their own pictures and not
mine i turned dizzy with a sort of ecstasy
i closed my eyes even with my eyes closed
i still saw the whole thing that beautiful
evil devilish panorama was in my mind not
my eyes thats how those fiends work
through the mind but i couldnt keep
away i knew it was death beckoning but
it was worth one moment with the vision
which particular vision asked harri-
son dryly

  jarvis flushed no matter but beside
me i heard leroy cry yvonne yvonne

i knew he was trapped like myself i fought
for sanity i kept telling myself to stop and
all the time i was rushing headlong into the
snare

  then something tripped me tweel he
had come leaping from behind as i crashed
down i saw him flash over me straight to-
ward-toward what id been running to his
vicious beak was pointed right at her heart
oh nodded the captain her heart
never mind that when i scrambled up
that particular image was gone tweel was
in a twist of black ropy arms jut as when
i first saw him hed missed a vital point in
the beasts anatomy but was jabbing away
desperately with his beak

  somehow the spell partially lifted i
wasnt five feet from tweel it took a ter-
rific struggle but i managed to raise my
revolver and put a boland shell into the
beast out came a spurt of horrible black
corruption drenching tweel and me i
guess the sickening smell of it helped to de-
stroy the illusion of that valley of beauty
anyway we managed to get leroy away
from the devil that had him and the three of
us staggered to the ridge and over i had
presence of mind enough to raise my cam-
era over the crest and take a shot of the
valley but ill bet it shows nothing but gray
waste and writhing horrors what we saw
was with our minds not our eyes

  jarvis paused and shuddered

 the brute half poisoned leroy we
dragged ourselves back to the auxiliary
called you and did what we could to treat
ourselves leroy took a long dose of the
cognac we had with us we didnt dare try
anything of tweels because his metabolism
is so different from ours that what cured him
might kill us but the cognac seemed to
work and so after id done one other thing
i wanted to do we came back here and
thats all

  all is it queried harrison so youve
solved all the mysteries of mars eh

  not by a damned sight retorted jarvis
plenty of unanswered questions are left
ja snapped schatz der evaporation
dot iss shtopped how

  in the canals i wondered about that
too in those thousands of miles and
against this low air-pressure youd think
theyd lose a lot but the answers simple
they float a skin of oil on the water
schatz nodded but harrison cut in
heres a puzzler with only coal and oil
-just combustion or electric power-
whered they get the energy to build a plan-
et-wide canal system  think of the job we
had cutting the panama canal to sea level
and then answer that

  easy grinned jarvis martian gravity
and martian air thats the answer figure it
out first the dirt they dug only weighed
a third its earth-weight second a steam
engine here expands against ten pounds per
square inch les air pressure than on earth
third they could build the engine three
times as large here with no greater internal
weight and fourth the whole planets
nearly level right schatz

  ja the engineer nodded der ehteam
engine it iss twenty-seven times so effective
here

dr joseph goldberger

 vur

 what are you going to do with us not
 going to vaccinate us with any germs or put
 some microbes in our food are you

   no men dr goldberger said seriously
 i will not do anything of the sort but
 theres one thing id like to know    have
 any of you ever suffered from pellagra

   pellagra echoed the convicts whats
 that

    its a disease that kills you a rash breaks
 out on your face your mouth gets sore you
 cant eat you cant sleep i hope to find a
 cure for this disease by our experiment

   pellagra the dread malady that struck
 mysteriously swiftly beginning with an in-
 nocent rash that looked lute a mild sun-burn
 but then turned into sores that made its
 victims look like lepers pellagra  it
 was scything down children adults spread-
 ing everywhere through the south like a
 veritable epidemic science was baffled by
 its cause it had failed to isolate the lethal
 virus that caused the disease   

   naw  we aint ever had pellagra
 one of the convicts answered and as for
 your experiment brother-feed us like you
 said and give us clean beds like you prom-
 ised and let us out six months from now
 win or lose that right governor

   dr goldberger nodded as he left the
 convicts apprehension flooded his mild eager

miles n- hand storf

m their

 eyes shouldnt he have explained the object
 of his experiment to the convicts but what
 was the use they couldnt understand that
 by giving them fine food better than the
 fare afforded the regular prisoners in the
 penitentiary they were jeopardizing their
 lives

   for dr goldberger had a theory he be-
 lieved that pellagra wasnt caused by any
 microbe or germ otherwise he reasoned
 the disease would be contagious if the
 word vitamin had been known in  dr
 goldberger would have said it was vitamins
 -or rather a lack of them-that caused pel-
 lagra as it was goldberger claimed it was
 a mysterious x quality found in proteins-
 in milk and in fresh meats-that kept people

 immune from pellagra 
 proteins this x and all the starch in the
 world couldnt prevent one from falling
 prey to this dreaded scourge

   that was dr goldbergers theory tliat
 accounted for the fact that the victims of
 pellagra were mainly the poverty-stricken
 classes of the south people who couldnt
 afford to buy fresh milk and meats

   some  people had died of pellagra
 in mississippi the year of  so gold-
 berger had sought out the governor of the
 state and told him his theory

   give me the use of some of your con-
 victs out at the rakin prison farm the
 jewish doctor had pleaded theres never
 been known to be any pellagra out there-
 and that would be the ideal place for me to
 try and produce it if i can induce pellagra
 among the convicts by keeping fresh milk
 and meat off their diet well know im right
 if they get the disease ill feed them milk
 and meat and theyll get better if nothing
 happens and im wrong    well you will
 have done humanity a great service

   it was harder than that to convince the
 governor but finally goldberger was sup-
 plied with his dozen volunteers

   and so the experiment began for break-
 fast the convicts were fed hot biscuits
 mush with gravy all the sugar and coffee
 they wanted for lunch they had cornbread
 collards sweet potatoes syrup and grits
 for supper they had the same as breakfast

   the twelve convicts didnt complain it
 was better food than they were used to get-
 ting it was better food than many of the
 people throughout the south could get all
 the latter got were molasses white hogmeat
 and meal whats more the twelve criminals
 knew that when the six months were up they
 would be free

   for fifty days nothing happened the
 convicts were cheerful went about their
 work with enthusiasm made jokes about
 the stupidity of dr goldberger and the gov-
 emor in allowing them their freedom so
 easily this scientific experiment was a
 laugh they agreed

   and dr goldberger he couldnt under-
 stand it th men seemed perfectly healthy
 unaffected in the least not that he hoped
 for the ugly rash to show up-but if his the-
 ories were wrong how n the devil could he
 ever achieve a cure for the thousands of pel-
 lagra victims who were sted to die yearly

   and then one morning it began to hap-
 pen striking suddenly like  plague the
 convicts got sick    complained of being
 unable to sleep suffering dizy spells big
 philip la salles stomach hvirt him  he
 couldnt show up for break ast and sim-
 ilarly with the others pellagra was striking

   a month more of dr goljbergers stem
 diet and the twelve convicts had reaped
 twelve cases of pellagra for themselves

   so dr goldberger had proved his theory
 correct for in the prison across the street
 sleeping in dirty beds and living off stale
 bread but with some occasional lresn meat
 and milk not one of the hundreds of con-
 victs there showed the slightest sign of
 pellagra

 the rest is medical history inspired by
 the thrill of his success lr goldberger
worked on to discover that yeast contains
the mysterious x that prevents pellagra
simple yeast costing only a few cents and
available to all the poor who cant afford
milk and meat

  the twelve convicts they made a beeline
for the nearest hamburger stand and wolfed
the stuff raw they drank gallons of milk
and the governor of mississippi paid the
check

mysterious alchemy

tauro claudius the most expert goldsmith in all the kingdom of
syracuse looked at the two lumps of metal before him one gold the other
silver and smiled a secret crafty smile his beady piglike eyes buried in
mounds of flesh glowed with greed and cunning

   tauros pudgy fingers fondled the lump of gold on the table before him
picked it up in one hand and weighed it speculatively indeed this mass of
metal was worth a fortune it was a magic metal for it could purchase for
its owner wine women and fine clothes how much more valuable it was than
all the other metals-silver for instance

   silver-there was an awkward metal heavy common it lacked the beauty
of gold was far less precious yet today 

tauro would perform some mysterious
alchemy and in the end the silver lump on
his table would be worth its weight in gold
how that was tauro claudius secret a
secret that no one in the entire empire of
syracuse would ever share with him

  for tauro claudius had been commis-
sioned to fashion the lump of gold on the
table into a crown for his king-king
hieron ii of syracuse tauro had been given
six pounds of the gold to transfer from its
ugly formless mas into a beautifully de-
signed regal crown tauro was to be well
rewarded upon the completion of his task-
for his product had to be fit to lay before
the king

  as tauro began heating the fire which
was to transform the six pounds of gold
into a molten stream of liquid splendor he
snorted audibly king hieron was a fool
he would praise claudius for the perfect iob
toss him a bag or two of gold coins and
the regent would wear the six-pound crown
on his head in uncomfortable glory for the
rest of his court days

  but-suppose claudius made a crown of
silver covered only with a thin coat of gold
plating the king would nevgr	the

deceptionand claudiuscoujdkeep the change
-the unused pounds of gold claudius chuck-
led to himself his sltne was perfect the
stupid king could nevcr guess that the crown
was not solid gold tijrou nit and even if
the king suspect h- uld not prove his
suspicions foj to	-in them would

mean sawing the cro m ha-ar what
monarch would do a j ing like that

 so claudius whis as he worked
pounded the anvil at is -wrs s wwt
about his royal task soon the counterfeit
crown was finjfshed its superficial golden
surface bathing it with a scintillant aura
tauro was prouj df hjs handiwork it was a
magnificent frnud

  time went by claudius delivered the
spurious crow to king hieron received
the royal blessings pius reward the court
showered hono rs upon claudius noblemen
flocked to his tore ordered rings and brace-
lets for thenaseive anct their ladies the
goldsmith dirj a thriving business

  then one day tauro claudius bubble

burst a page sent by the king ordered
him to appear before the ruler at once as
claudius hurried along after the messenger
his heart beat a nervous tattoo had the
king discovered his deception was his
crime to be exposed claudius broke into a
chilled sweat no he reassured himself
they had nothing on him his plan had been
foolproof there was no way in the world
of revealing the fact that the bulk of the
kings crown was composed of a metal
cheaper baser than gold the king prob-
ably wanted him to make some new bauble
perhaps a trinket for his favorite courtesan

  king hieron threw aside the leg of mut-
ton he had been chewing on as claudius
entered the court

  stand knave he shouted i should have
you killed in your tracks i

  claudius blanched your majesty a
dont understand you are jesting  
his voice broke off as he noticed that the
king was wearing a frown instead of a crown
the crown lay at his feet discarded
neglecte

  king hieron kicked the crown at his feet
you thief he roared  tis not gold in this
crown tis some lowly worthless metal
what have you done with the gold i gave
you

  tauros beady eyes pivoted to the crown
that the king had kicked away it was still
whr-le uncut untampered with how then
had t king guessed that it was a counter-
feit the king didnt know he was only
bluffing tauro saw hope ahead a slim
chance to save his skin

  vpur majesty he said in oily tones this
crown is made of solid gold as are all the
articles in my shop perhaps there are some
minor impurities within it the work of some
bungling assistant i shall take it back with
me melt it down again and examine it if
it suits your pleasure then you will have
a crown of the purest gold in all the world

  but tauro claudius was not to escape
as simply as that

  hold on wretch the king raged im-
purities eh there is not enough gold in
this crown to pay a slaves wages i know

  how do you know asked the baffled


claudius his face an alabaster white he
couldnt understand it how had he been
caught what slip had he made

  for answer the king beckoned to his left
at a tall scholarly looking man standing
beside him the king nodded at the wise
looking man

  explain to this scoundrel how we know
his crown is a fraud the king ordered

  the tall man walked over to a table in the
center of the court he gestured to an at-
tendant who brought out a large tub of
water then the tall man produced another
object-a solid lump of gold

   watch me closely tauro claudius the
tall man addressed him i take this lump
of gold and place it within this tub of water
the water rises you see because it is dis-

 laced in part by the weight of the gold
t rises to this level at that point the tall
man made a notch on the inside of the tub
indicating the height to which the water had
risen

  this lump of gold the wise-looking
man said ominously weighs exactly the
same amount as yonder gold crown you man-
ufactured for our king now i will place the
crown in this tub of water

  realization of what the tall man was driv-
ing at flooded tauros fogged mind he
began to see something very significant

about the wise-looking mans actions es the
latter reached for counterfeit crown im-
mersed it in the tub of water

  see the man went on this time the
water reached a much higher level in the
tub if this crown had been made of gold
it would have displaced exactly the same
amount of water as the golden lump i sub-
merged before which was equal in amount
to the gold given you by his majesty there-
fore we can only conclude that the content
of this crown is mainly of some baser more
worthless element

  tauro was speechless he was licked the
tall man had him dead to rights

 what made you suspect me he man-
aged to stammer out at last

  the tall man smiled awise good-natured
smile the king had once told me that his
crown might be composed of some metal
other than gold for all he knew but so long
as no one would be able to prove otherwise
he was content but the other day while
taking a bath i noticed that the water rose
when i got into the tub to a certain level
eureka i cried i had found it i had dis-
covered a means of ascertaining the truth

 who are you claudius asked what
is your name

  my name said the tall man softly you
have never heard of it i am -archimides

the india rubber man

charles goodyear was a rainbow chaser he wanted a million dol-
lars and because he wanted a million dollars he wore an india rubber
cap coat vest and shoes with an india rubber purse that was empty

    rubber ruled charles goodyears life it dominated his attire its odor per-
vaded his laboratory his home crept into the nostrils of all his acquaintances
it was his greatest worry-and his fondest hope
for charles goodyear was after a million-dollar pot of gold a pot of gold
that he realized he could collect if he was able to discover how rubber the all-
important industrial material could be made heat-resistant

   for rubber in  was not like the rubber of today it decayed quite
rapidly warm weather softened it and hot
weather made it as sticky and gooey as
melted marshmallow-quite unsuitable for
use

a rubber that would not decompose so
rapidly nor melt at ordinary temperatures
-that was the quest of charles goodyear

that was his million-dollar rainbow that
was why he lived rubber loved it studied
its properties under every conceivable con-
dition

for every one of the million dollars good-
year wanted he conducted a different exper-
iment he treated samples of rubber with
scores of reagents-lime magnesia white
lead nitric acid and numerous others his
wifes stove never cooked any broth-the
only soup her household ever saw was of
boiled rubber

years rolled by still goodyear chased
his rainbow-a rainbow that seemed to
stretch further away with the elasticity of
rubber itself still the experimenter hoped phur and exposed to the sun the rubber be-
to find how to make rubber more durable came more hardy

finally one happy day he discovered that goodyear was thrilled the government

ru-depth pictures inc
had reached a climax and a
crisis in a long career of cli-
maxes and crises it was casting at
last for the picture departure with
the whirlwind and harold debussy
was searching frantically for the right
glamour girl to play the role of pinkie
the space ship captains daughter

  on the producers desk were stacks
of mail and photographs from the very
corners of the solar system radio-
grams and spacegrams continued to
pour in by the hour every day-please
for a televisor test from allura the
it girl of venus an urgent request
from the martian council to test
xzenia superb actress of the red
planet a letter from the chamber of
commerce of mcgillicudy iowa send-
ing the picture of dora dingle beauty
prize winner at the last county fair

it was enough to drive de bussy mad

  of course his staff of experts
combed through and checked every
submission talent scouts were run-
ning expense accounts up into tele-
phone numbers as they searched the
five inhabited worlds of the solar sys-
tem and still no star debussy was
becoming annoyed for nearly a hun-
dred years plans had gone forward for
the making of this epic film of the
spaceways three generations of de-
busseys had sought in vain for the
right heroine to play the part and now
it looked as though the fourth inheri-
tor of the famous debussy directorial
crown was doomed to failure

  but i must not fail declared de-
bussy running his fingers through his
synthetic hair implanted in his scalp
in his fortieth year by hirsute elec-
troponics when great-grandfather
darrel debussy bought that story he
did not dream that his own son would
not live to produce the picture this



is almost monotonous

  please mr debussy said the soft
voice of his secretary wont you give
me just one screen test for the role
no no no for the hundredth
time no miss montayne the harried
producer shouted youre an efficient
secretary and a brilliant young wom-
an but you simply havent the fire the
ardor the - the atmosphere back-
ground experience-the-the neces-

she threw her arms around the pilot

sary oomph to portray that part
please go away and leave me in my
despair no more letters or grams
this morning please

  but youve never seen me in make-
up marcia protested indignantly
youve never seen me act you wont
even give me a chance

  no-no-and no again good-by
please i wish to be alone

  he flung himself from his desk to
the intricate instrument panel and
televisor screen which took up one
entire wall as his hobby the great
debussy had turned to interspatial
glamour girl-

communication strictly amateur of
course he was known as the biggest
ham in the ether he flipped a couple
of switches and started twisting dials
as the girl frowned wistfully at his
back then miss montayne withdrew
from the luxurious office just as a
blare of wild venusian music came
from the telemikes behind the crystal
screen she closed the door and
spread her hands helplessly as she
glanced at the handsome young man
who stood in the outer office

this chap sam dozment first
assistant electrician for tru-
depth smiled at the girl and made his
way out of the office marcia sat at
her desk and began answering tele-
screen summons opening mail and
making appointments for her em-
ployer

  back in his office debussy was fret-
fully shifting his detector beam from
one part of the solar system to an-
other idly searching out crowds on
jupiter a gathering on mars a wine
shop in the steaming jungle town of
neopaline on venus-and focusing
the close-up ray on any female figure
that even excited a flicker of interest
but all in vain

  then something clicked in the bat-
tery of rheostats the very crystal of
the screen quivered and in the midst
of a scene of a desert orator harangu-
ing a crowd of prospectors in a min-
ing camp on ganymede another scene
was imposed it was a scene of a space
port somewhere-it looked like the
the terrain of the moon a split de-
tector torque that happened some-
times but rarely

  debussy was reaching for the dis-
connecting switch when he became
interested in the super-imposed scene
there right in the middle of the min-
ing camp fragments of which could
be seen all around the central picture
was an attack on a space ship wild-
looking creatures were storming the
open port of the vessel ray guns and
cudgels and rocks in hand it was a
ravening mob and it looked like the
finish of the gallant crew of three who
battled to protect the ship debussy
wondered where it was and whether

he would view the subsequent news
projection on his tomorrow mornings
micro-film newspaper

   at this instant a vivid vibrant fig-
ure of a girl leaped out of the strug-
gling mass and sprang to the side of
the hard-pressed space pilots threw
her arms around one of them

  back ye scum of morgrulac
came her ringing voice can ye not
see that these men have come with the
star of emerlos to save you from the
ravages of the creeping plague
would ye destroy the very men who
bring ye hope

  there was more but debussy paid
little attention to the words which
oddly enough he could hear above the
roaring discord of two separate scenes
he was charmed enthralled by the
girls voice even as he reached forth
hesitantly to attempt adjustment
which would focus a close-up the
scene swept rapidly toward him and
the form and features of the girl filled
the entire split section of the crystal
her flowing dark hair her lambent
and flashing dark eyes the play of
passion and emotion on her lovely mo-
bile features fascinated the producer

  he could not tear his eyes away he
didnt even hear the office door behind
him as it opened marcia montayne
came softly into the room

  please mr debussy all i ask is
a single chance to show you what i
can do if you will only-

  shut up roared mr debussy
never looking around at his secretary
ive found the woman to play the part
of pinkie great god but where is
she how can i find her dont talk
look if you want to see a marvelous
actress send for dozment-quick i
want him to check this screen and lo-
cate that girl hurry cant you

swered the cool voice of the
electritician so you like the lady

bussy said the electrician allow
me to present my wife-known to you
only as the oomphless miss mon-

  debussy gaped at the figure of his
own secretary marcia had turned
open the throat of her pastel uniform
her glasses had disappeared and her
dark brown hair was flowing about her
face in wild disorder undoubtedly
she was the original of the girl de-
picted on the crystal screen behind
him as he stared and gurgled mar-
cia cried as the girl on the screen had
cried

  would ye destroy the very men

fainted

              a guest editorial

by dr niles j ereier

                                 famous scienlificlion author

it has always been the adolescents of the
race who have lived on adventure ad-
venture has always involved pushing out
from the known and familiar into the new
and unknown the adult of the race has
usually been satisfied with the established
order

  when the human race was
confined to small areas of the
earths surface almost every
individual was surrounded by
adventure it was a perfect set-
ting for youth a stones throw
away was darkness and fight-
ing and new lands as people
spread and congested upon the
earth those crowded into the
middle of the group did not
have opportunities for adven-
ture as did those on the edges

thus an ever decreasing pro-
portion of young people were
able to get out into new fron-
tiers more and more were
forced to stay at home and live
the life of the old people

  therefore tales and stories
of adventure took the place of real adven-
ture the creative art of story-telling dates
back into the dimmest dawn of human be-
ginnings savage youngsters sitting around
a fire and listening to the experienced story-
teller are our original prototype of the
science fiction magazine

  homers illiad and odessey are good
science fiction those things probably never
really happened they were invented to ap-
pease the restlessness of those who wished
adventure and could not reach it

  we are denied knowledge of the inspira-
tion for adventure which must have existed
in europe from the th to th century
with the americas open to those who wanted
a taste of glory it must have been a grand
science fiction period

  we do have real knowledge of the go
west period of american history lasting

two hundred years in those days there was
not merely action there were stories and
what stories they are still famous and
always will be

  at the present time geographical frontiers
have been exhausted it seems that new
fields for adventure are closed to adolescents
in that respect with the ex-
ception of small areas at both
poles there are practically no
new lands to conquer

  as usual the story teller is
ahead of actual life nearly
one hundred years ago jules
verne took us exploring into
the arctic under the sea in
submarines and flying in the
air he slyly skipped techni-
calities he knew that clever
engineers would work them out
later

  so today the frontier is the
stratosphere the moon the
milky way technicalities do
not matter are not the adults
working them out youth is
waiting for their elders to build
the ships and forge the guns in the mean-
while we can tell stories about it

  even the prosaic oceans that border our
continent offer a new frontier man has not
yet probed their incredible depths pros-
pected the lands that lie submerged

  jules verne skimmed the surtace of this
vista in his visionary works it remains for
the pioneers of tomorrow to go deeper un-
veil the secrets of the submarine regions

  nowadays we cannot all sit abont the fire
and listen to an expert tell a story there
are too many millions of us the age is not
addicted to blank verse but the modern
science fiction magazines serve the same
function as did all the mythological varia-
tions down the ages it is still the inspira-
tion of adolescents to adventure and prog-
ress that is how the human race has al-
ways gotten ahead and always will

perpetual notion

editor science question box

recently you ran an article on perpetual motion why is it that they say perpetual
motion is impossible according to your statements is not the earth turning on its axis
a case of perpetual motion and since the moon causes tides which furnish power
through tide motors and the moons motion is perpetual why is not a tide motor a per-
petual-motion machine-j w bangor maine

  in the terms of one human life and per-
haps of the life of the human race the earth-
moon system might bo called a perpetual-
motion-machine but even the earth-moon
system is running down with the exertion of
energy in the tides the rotational energy of
the earth is in the order of twelve billion
billion horsepower years according to an esti-
mate it is losing by tidal friction a billion
and a half horsepower steadily at the current
rate perhaps if sufficient tide-motors could

be put on it in places like bering sea the loss
could be increased by utilization as power

  however the true perpetual-motion ma-
chine is one which orrairn power-at least
enough to overcome its own friction a sun-
power motor might run with repairs and
renewals as long as the sun continues to
shine-and the sun barring accidents should
last a trillion years but it would not be a
perpetual-motion machine-any more than a
steam engine or an electric motor which also
derives power from an outside source-ed

the earths rotation

editor science question box

in a recent issue of startling stories i read a story by alexander samalman
the lost hour it was a good story but i would like tt know whether its scientific
basis was accurate do changes occur in the earths rate of rotation-e h boonton
n j

  the lost hour certainly was based upon
fact checking movements of the sun against
movements of the earth for the last 
years the late professor e w brown of tale
university found there is little reason to
doubt that real changes in the earths rate of
rotation do occur his suggestion for the
cause of such changes is that in the earth
there is a layer near the surface which haa
the ability to undergo relatively great volume
changes for small temperature changes thus
a small change in the earths internal condi-
tion might make a sizeable volume change in

the earth a change of only  inches in-the
earths radius could produce a one-second
difference in the length of the earths year
prof brown observed

  a teat of this hypothesis could be made by
studying bulges in the earth and the most
likely place to look for them would be in
regions in which mountains are still rising
so with suitable equipment placed in these
regions scientists may some day learn the
secret of strange variation in the earths
speed of rotation-ed

no chemical mysteries

editor science question box

are there any substances which when mixed with a chemical compound will prevent
its analysis i have heard that manufacturers of some preparations use chemicals called
stops to perplex anyone attempting analysis and so to keep their formulas secret-
a k new york city n y

  as regards the elements of a chemical com-
pound it is impossible to prevent their detec-
tion by a mixture though in the case of a
number of rare elements the difficulty may
be increased the spectroscope it is claimed
will separate any elements from even their
isotopes

  as regards an organic compound where it
is desirable to note the different compounds
of carbon oxygen hydrogen nitrogen sul-
phur etc an analysis may be difficult be-
cause it is desired to preserve the substances
unchanged and they can be separated only by

solution and evaporation this is a long and
tedious process

  almost any vegetable or animal substance
of a complicated nature would make it addi-
tionally difficult for a chemist to give an exact
determination of the formulas actually used
in a medicine or cosmetic but he would easily
be able to report there is such a percentage
of oil such a percentage of starch etc and
givea formula which if not identical would
effect a very similar result any important
mineral ingredient would be easily recognized

lilliihjt

by raymond z gallln

author of saturns ringmaster red shards on ceres etc

break it all or ill shoot rut hie cried

dane thorne had felt the
hot congealed lava of a volcano
trembling beneath his feet he
had looked from the thick windows of
a bathysphere at the grotesque horrors
that swarmed in the black deeps of the
pacific he had viewed the bright stars
of space from a rocket that probed
above the stratosphere but never be-
fore in his adventurous life had he been
so disturbingly awed and scared as he
was now

  the low flat jardiniere which stood

countless living worlds hang
in the balance when an
unearthly menace reaches
from beyond the atom

on a table beside his piano contained a
miniature landscape quaintly modeled
by some japanese master of a dainty art
there were hills there there was even
a tiny lake containing real water sup-
plied daily by ruth thornes child
startling stories

there were bridges toy temples and
live trees artificially distorted into bi-
zarre yet pleasing shapes after the
fashion of the ornamental trees of nip-
pon

  so the dwarf landscape had always
been since thorne had bought it for
ruth a month ago but now-almost
in an instant-a fresh and un-earthly
element had been added appearing
magically from nowhere

  at the edge of the little lake a min-
ute spirelike cone an inch high had
suddenly come into being thorne had
been playing the piano absently his
gaze had been directed straight toward
the jardiniere at the moment of the
miracle he had seen what looked like
a puff of smoke rise out of the soil of
the miniature garden the smoke had
seemed to shape itself forming the
cone

  thornes music had broken off
abruptly now his pulses pounding
he had jumped to his feet he bent
over to examine the phenomenon more
closely saw that the cone was far too
tenuous in composition to be called
solid yet in spite of its pearly vapor-
ous texture it was capable of retaining
a fixed shape its diaphanous surface
was dotted with what might have been
ornamental bosses around it there
clung a scarcely visible hint of a lum-
inous aura giving it somehow a blood-
chilling aspect of nameless malignance
thome scrutinized it intently for sev-
eral moments

now with the same instinctive hes-
itation that one might feel at the
prospect of touching a live snake he
moved his fingers toward the cone his
intention being to examine it tactually
as well as visually

  the gesture however was stopped
before it was half completed there
was a patter of footsteps behind thorne
then a shrill protest

  daddy dont youll break it

  thome turned about and what he
beheld left him speechless the past
minute had brought him in contact
with the unknown yet this first shock
was nothing compared to the mixture of
wild feelings which the tableau now be-
for him poured into his mind

  ruth his seven-year-old daughter
stood stiffly at the center of the floor
her plump little arms were extended
out before her drawing the sleeves of
her dress in tight creases about her
shoulders there were big tears on her
cheeks in her chubby fists she held
clumsily but very dangerously an ugly
automatic pistol its muzzle pointed
straight at dane thomes breast

  the pistol was his of course thorne
knew that it was fully loaded and he
could see that the safety was not locked
ruth had evidently contrived to remove
the weapon from a trunk in his bed-
room

  thome did not pause to consider the
causes of his daughters behavior he
could only concern himself now with
the immediate problem of getting the
situation in hand children however
were not exactly in his line his ad-
venturous means of livelihood had
taken him far afield and he had never
been with the motherless child that he
loved for more than a month or two at a
time

  thorne frowned and grinned trying
to simulate annoyed tolerance

  please ruthie he said you know
thats not nice if you were with aunt
rose now shed be very severe with
you

  ruth grimaced petulant and tearful

  dont touch the little new thing in
my garden she ordered and do just
what i tell you cause if you dont ill
shoot you daddy ill shoot you dead

 why-kiddo thorne burst out
and then he stopped this was no mere
infantile vagary this was-thorne
could scarcely hazard a guess

  in ruths eyes still wet with tears
caused perhaps by a transient fright
during the moment when some alien
compulsion had evidently gripped her
there was a glassy glitter like that of
the fixed stare of catalepsy he arms
soft and dimpled seemed to stiffen
bringing the pistol into a more menac-
ing alignment and leaving no doubt
that a purpose cold and certain and un-
yielding guided the little girls every
word and act

  strong resourceful fellow though he
was dane thome realized that if he
made one suspicious move-even the
nemesis from lilliput



slightest-his life was forfeit this in
itself would not have strangled his dar-
ing should a favorable opportunity
appear but it was the thought that if
he were killed she would be left alone in
the grip of something hidden and incom-
prehensible that prompted him to cau-
tion

  dads your friend kiddo he said
still smiling what do you want me
to do

  take me to where the doctor lives
ruth ordered

  you mean doctor orbis in the next
apartment thorne questioned

   yes the little girl answered

  thorne frowned thoughtfully orbis
was a reclusive experimenter in what
way could he be involved in this fan-
tastic sequence of weird events

  the doctor wont let us in kiddo
dane protested he doesnt like peo-
ple and he always keeps his apartment
locked

  then well have to make him let us
in ruth or whatever it was that had
dominated ruth shrilled lead the
way quick daddy or ill shoot you
dead

thorne made no more protests
for he knew with a puckering
thrill of dread that the threat was not
an idle one he turned about and
walked past the table which supported
the miniature japanese garden and its
tiny visitant enigma and proceeded on
toward the exit of his quarters

  keenly he reviewed his limited
knowledge of orbis often thome had
heard subdued buzzes and faint me-
chanical throbbings in the rooms occu-
pied by his queer wizened neighbor
he had noticed too that he could not
keep photographic film here for more
than a few days always it spoiled

  ruths glassy gaze missed no slight
detail of her fathers movements as he
approached the exit door the pistol
held stiffly in her hands remained
pointed at his vitals with the inescap-
able certainty of fate

  he opened the door and strode out
into the hall followed closely by his
little captor there was no one in sight
and he was aware that to make any
outcry would be fatal

  it was only a few steps to the en-
trance of apartment  occupied by
doctor orbis

  ring the bell daddy ruth or-
dered in a loud whisper

  dane thorne obeyed wondering
helplessly what further bizarre confu-
sions would take place during the next
several moments his first unwilling
attempt to announce his presence to
orbis produced no response and so he
tried again by straining his ears he
could detect a dim and sleepy hum-
ming which originated from within the
old scientists lair

  now there were light unsteady foot-
falls orbis was approaching pain-
fully conscious of the muzzle of the
automatic held close to his back thome
waited

  a key rattled in the lock the door
opened a few inches and a pair of be-
spectacled eyes set in a small pallid
mouselike face peered out with a ques-
tioning squint of annoyance

  dane thome would have found dif-
ficulty in explaining the nature of his
visit to orbis but the need for such an
explanation was taken from him before
a fumbling er-ah was well past his
lips

   ruth did not hesitate

   let us in mister doctor she said
let us in or ill shoot you

  still betraying signs of annoyance
orbis looked down toward the source
of the commanding words his my-
opic vision seemed to have difficulty in
locating ruth half hidden behind the
big body of her father when he saw
her at last and saw the amazing and
deadly incongruity of the blued auto-
matic clutched in her rose-petal fingers
his surprise was almost pitiful for one
to behold

  orbis jaw dropped as he gulped air
raspingly into his lungs his eyes
bulged behind his spectacles and his
pallid sunken cheeks seemed to wither
and collapse further like snow visibly
melting theodore orbis was a scien-
tist and while one who dares to un-
mask the mighty mysteries of nature
cannot lack a specialized courage the
courage he needed now was not of the
kind that had been built into his sys-
tem facing firearms was one situa-


startling stories

tion for which he was not emotionally
prepared

  i think youd better do what my
daughter says and grant us your hos-
pitality doctor thorne advised con-
trolling his voice carefully you can
understand i believe that all three of
us are faced by something rather odd
and incomprehensible yet nevertheless
important

  the old experimenter didnt answer
at once he only pulled the door open
weakly and retreated backward into his
quarters dane followed and ruth
still the small but guiding nemesis
brought up the rear kicking the door
shut behind her

  what-what do you want orbis
stammered at the two intruders

dane thorne felt an impulse to
attempt a presentation of his ex-
periences of the last several minutes
but he suppressed it glancing instead
toward ruth for in her he knew must
rest the core of the fantastic and devil-
ish enigma

doctor she declared unemotion-
ally surveying the intricate and expen-
sive apparatus in the room we have to
break all the stuff youve got here
the thoughts which her words

aroused in the minds of her audience
of two must have been many and con-
flicting theodore orbis was still
badly frightened yet he must have
wondered now whether he should take
a statement of such weight seriously
coming as it did from a dainty little
girl who should be cuddling dolls in-
stead of supervising criminally destruc-
tive acts from behind the maw of a
deadly weapon

  please little lady he stammered
you cant mean what you say why
i-ive been working on the problem
of unleashing atomic energy f and im
beginning to succeed ive spent thou-
sands of dollars on this equipment
almost every penny i own think of
what it will mean to science and to
civilization when-when- but of
course you cant understand what im
talking about youre-youre only a
baby

  regardless of her status socially
chronologically and mentally how-
ever ruth thome was possessed of a
purpose that was clear obstinate and
unalterable on a low shelf close be-
side her were many bottles and jars
containing chemicals with a move-
ment as quick as a cat she reached
continued on page 

i talked with god 

        yes i did-actually and literally

and as a result of that little talk with god a
strange power came into my life after 
years of horrible dismal sickening failure
everything took on a brighter hue its fasci-
nating to talk with god and it can be done very
easily once you leam the secret and when you
do-well-there will come into your life the
same dynamic power which came into mine
the shackles of defeat which bound me for

fears went a-shimmering-and now--well
own control of the largest daily newspaper in
our county i own the largest office building
in our city i drive a beautiful cadillac limou-
sine i own my own home which has a lovely
pipe-organ in it and my family are abundantly
provided for after im gone and all this has
been made possible because one day ten years
ago  actually and literally talked with god

  you too may experience that strange mysti-
cal power which comes from talking with god
and when you do if there is poverty unrest

unhappiness or ill-health in your life well-
this sam god-power is able to do for you what
it did for me no matter how useless or help-
less your life seems to be-all this can be
changed for this is not a human power im
talking about-its a god-power and there can
be no limitations to the god-power can there
of course not you probably would like to
know how you too may talk with god so that
this same power which brought me these good
things might come into your life too well-just
write a letter or a post-card to dr frank b
robinson dept  moscow idaho and full
particulars of this strange teaching will be
sent to you free of charge but write now-
while you are in the mood it only costs one
cent to find out and this might easily be the
most profitable one cent you have ever spent

 how can we be so sure because weve watched

 you could spend a lot more but in our opinion
 you wouldnt get anything better for a tough beard

 water it soothes the skin it softens the beard your
 razor slides through it like nothing at all and leaves

 cover from novel this issue

 by harry nowalcowski

   ever since i started reading startling
 stories about a year ago i always wanted
 to congratulate the editors for publishing
 such a wonderful magazine so ira taking
 this opportunity to express my gratitude by
 writing you this letter first hats off to
 you publishers for featuring a complete book-
 length novel in every issue of s s thats
 what we s-f fans have been waiting for for
 a long time then take your departments
  re perfection a-l i especially enjoy
 lg thrills in science and science
 question box the short stories particu-
 larly scientiflctionb hall of fame are the
 tops in reading entertainment

   i have just completed reading the janu-
 ary  issue of startling stories the
 three planeteers by edmond hamilton was
 the best scientifiction novel i have ever read
 he really unfolded a wonderful and great
 fantasy tale in this story more power to
 him in the future

   i find one thing wrong about ss and that
 is i don t think that the cover painting should
 be illustrated from a short story im sure
 that many other readers agree with me on
 this point well heres hoping startling
 stories reach a ripe old age- dubois

 try captain future

 by wallace riley

   i am writing to tell you of my approval
 of your novel the three planeteers i have
 read quite a few scientifiction magazines with
 fair stories in all but this story is one of the
 best yet

   you cannot call me a scientifiction vet-
 eran because i am only twelve i began
 reading your magazine in september when
 my big brother began reading it i also high-
 ly approve of the book-length novel in one
 earlier issue the fortress of utopia by
 jack williamson

   i do not like stories of blood and thunder
 or of crime in scientifiction when i started
 to read the three planeteers i thought it
 was one of the latter variety but the title
 didnt sound like that so i read on a bit then
 i found that john thorn sual av and gunner
 welk were merely posing and doing a great
 service to the whole solar system a com-
 pletely radio-active planet as described in
 hamiltons novel is a good trick for a story

requests

by d b thompson

  congratulations the three planeteers
is another good long story ive read five
issues of ss now and have yet to and a
poor feature novel i rate the stories in
order as follows

	the fortress of utopia

	the prisoner of mars

         	the bridge to earth

        	the black flame

	the three planeteers

  i place the three planeteers last because
of the emphasis on adventure nevertheless it
is a very good adventure story my personal

ereference is for a little heavier type of story
ence the first place ranking given to the
fortress of utopia

  so far ss has contained stories of suffi-
cient diversity to satisfy almost any reader
without any serious drop in quality in-
cidentally i think the three planeteers is
considerably better than the first captain
future story

  im sorry the omission of the crossword
puzzle and other similar features is only tem-
porary i would be glad to see them omitted
regularly miss or mrs beasley notwith-
standing

  how about a feature novel by some of the
following a e van vogt harl vincent
lester del ray c l moore amelia r long
laurence manning william grey beyer ward
hawkins robert moore williams or frank
kelknap long jr i might name many more
but that will do for a starter

  henry kuttners forthcoming novel should
provide another good story on a topic and in a
style differing from any of its predecessors
in ss

  heres hoping for continued growth-

but futures future is ok

by allan keniston jr

  though fully aware that this missive may
never be seen in print i feel it necessary to
offer my comments upon certain of your re-
cent events i read with utmost interest
the story of the three planeteers ed ham-
iltons contribution to your january issue and
i wish to state here that it was one of the
best interplanetary stories in a long time it
was the high quality of this saga of the men
of the spaceways that led me to write this
letter not in comment upon the planeteers
but upon your new companion magazine
captain future

  since this magazine i fear will not last
the length of its perfectly grand serial-a
cosmic shame as someone said-i address this
to startling stories when hamilton
can write such really good material as in
this january issue why in all space docs he
stoop to becoming the inventor of a character
heretofore found only in the comic strips
robots androids and supermen  i wonder
if mr hamilton reads harpers magazine

  in the september issue there is an article
calling every mans attention to the material
of doom and impossibility pictured in science
fiction

  it is stories of the type exemplified by cap-
tain future that cause just such violent de-
bunking of a truly fine type of literature
fine only when written by one capable or
deep thought or even of coherent and clear
reasoning

 no man can hope to compare the ama-
teurish attempts of some of the present-day
writers with such masterpieces as those of
weinbaum williamson or dr smith a fact
which any fan will vehemently support

thus my sentiments if this letter be

eubllshed i shall at least know you are not
ilnd to criticism

  in regard to startling stories keep
up the good work you have few faults but
i feel the foregoing criticism to be necessary
ere you are misled i also feel that others
will agree heartily with me-many others

  my best wishes for your continued success

his nerve and his will

  he grasped a chair raised it aloft
and brought it down on the as-
sembly of delicate mechanisms and de-
vices that surrounded the great globe

  orbis driven by a frenzy of terror
was also engaged in the wanton wreck-
ing of the creation that had taken years
of thought and effort on his part to pro-
duce two chairs one wielded by the
old experimenter the other by dane
thorne rose and fell methodically un-
til only tangled ruins remained of the
apparatus the quartz globe was
smashed the incandescent contents of
the crucible inside it spilled on the floor
igniting the wood perhaps part of the
heat in the molten stuff was energy
freed from its disintegrating atoms

  automatically thorne reached for a
fire extinguisher on the wall simulta-
neously there were three crashing re-
ports behind him orbis standing
dazedly near stiffened gasped sib-
ilantly and slumped down amid the de-
bris of his apparatus

  thorne in spite of the dread import
of this latest piece of adverse fortune
still had enough presence of mind to
turn about slowly an abrupt move-
ment of any kind might have brought
him the same treatment which had been
accorded to the old doctor

  there was no doubt that it was ruth
who had fired the shots she had crum-
pled against the door as if pushed there
by the recoil of the heavy weapon
which now lay smouldering on the floor
beside her she was wringing her
bruised fingers and on her face there
was a look of numb terror and surprise
as if she had just awakened from a hor-
rible nightmare

  daddy she screamed daddy
what happened what did i do

  defensive impulse made thorne leap
to her side he picked up the gun and
pocketed it when the police investi-
gated- thornes mind was working

all three bullets having entered his
back but he was not yet dead his
eyes were open

  i heard what your daughter just
said he whispered she wasnt-mad
she was being controlled-from outside
herself-until she awakened a moment
ago just a hunch of mine-partly
maybe im a little to blame for all that
happened how did things begin
what i mean is were there any-any
strange circumstances that you no-
ticed before you came here to my lab

  yes thorne replied quickly i
saw a tiny cone of what looked like
gray mist in my apartment i was
playing the piano and then the cone
appeared suddenly from out of no-
where ruth had the gun pointed at
me a couple of minutes later maybe
the cone is still in the miniature garden
where it materialized

 then take me to your apartment-
at once orbis said with tense effort
 his withered ghostlike visage animated
by a burning eagerness i must see i
must understand before i-no dont
trouble about the blaze what we must
do is far more important anyway
the building is fireproof the flames
cannot get far though they will not be
easy to extinguish the incandescent
fluid from the crucible is molten iron
part of whose atoms were breaking up
-freeing their energy fire kindled
i by it is more difficult to put out than
 that kindled by thermit throw the pis-
j tol where the heat will erase what evi-
j dence it bears hurry i hear peoples
i voices

somehow thome was conscious
of a deep confidence now in the
dying scientist in his last minutes or-
bis was proving himself truly great in
more ways than one

   thome tossed the automatic into the
wreckage of the flaming atomic appa-
ratus then gently he raised orbis in
his arms and carried him toward the
door against which ruth still crouched
frightened tearful and uncomprehend-
ing

   several loud reports sounded behind
thorne as heat exploded the cartridges
still in the magazine of the pistol the
 din provoked cries and shouts of con-
 sternation and suspicion among the
 various tenants of the building who had
 been attracted by the disturbance in
 the orbis apartment and had now gath-
 ered in the corridor without

   theres been an accident here
 thorne was explaining a moment later
 to the people in the hall someone
 phone for a physician and call the po-
 lice and the fire department

   before any zealous souls could offer
 inconvenient assistance thorne carry-
 ing orbis and followed by ruth had
 entered his own quarters and had
 fastened the door against any immed-
 iate intrusion

   orbis eyes had been closed but now
 he opened them again

   the cone he rasped thickly
 where show me

   dane thorne looked toward the jar-
 diniere which contained the miniature
 japanese garden

   you wont be disappointed in that
 respect doctor he said carrying the
 old man close to the table

   orbis twisted his scrawny neck to see
 the peaked inch-high enigma of gray
 pearly translucence that still rested be-
 side the toy lake for a minute he
 looked at it with fierce scientific inter-
 est then the thing began to fade
 swiftly from view it was withdrawing
 back into the unknown place or region
 from which it had sprung

   orbis sighed

   put me down somewhere he com-
 manded

   thome laid him on a divan went to
 the medicine chest for first-aid mater-
 ials

   dont bother too much about my
 injury orbis said when dane returned
 im done for my fault i think though
 somebody is liable to be accused of
 murder but therere still several mat-
 ters which i still want to-must-know
 about your daughter-talk to her-
 ask her if she was conscious of anything
 when she was-was under the outside
 influence

   as he worked over the old experi-
 menters mortal wounds thorne called
 ruth close

before you woke up in the doctors
apartment kiddo he asked

  ruth looked at him with vague
frightened eyes

  i was some place that wasnt like
here she said there was a green sun
and a green sky and there werent any
real people just big goblins all black
and shiny the goblins were scared
theyd been scared for a long time

  what were they scared of little
lady orbis questioned

   at night there were things like the
moon shooting through the sky ruth
responded the goblins were afraid
that those things would hit the place
where they lived and kill them all for
a long long time theyd been afraid and
had been building a machine theyd
found out somehow that a very big
giant was making it so they were in
danger

  orbis doomed though he was
seemed almost avid with eagerness as
he listened to the childs strange ac-
count

   did the goblins tell you all this he
 demanded

i uth frowned in concentration be-
fore she answered no she
replied matter-of-factly i was one of
the goblins i wanted to kill the giant
i was very very angry

  thats enough orbis gasped i
know now i was the giant the cone
was the machine the goblins built it
i was a mental-control device-expanded
in some way-sent up from an atomic
micro-solar system i suppose the more
j flexible minds of children would be
 more susceptible to its influence than
the minds of-adults thats why-the
goblins chose ruth as a subject-a
tool-instead of you or me thome
my apparatus had to be destroyed and
i had to be destroyed too so i couldnt
build another apparatus

  what are you talking about
thorne demanded sharply

   dont you see orbis rasped the
nucleus of an atom is a real but tremen-
dously small sun the electrons which
revolve around it are real planets i
was beginning to succeed in the releas
atom-smashing i was destroying j
worlds thorne a few of them inhab-
ited  i was using a form of corpuscular
bombardment to do this here in the
inner texture of the soil of your toy
garden was one of these inhabited
planets

  stray corpuscular radiations leaking
form my equipment were shooting
through the wall between my apart-
ment and yours an extremely minute
part of those scattering corpuscles was
threatening our friends the goblins
but their science enabled them to find
me out they-took steps many ages
of their time must have been needed to
deal with me for a second in our uni-
verse must be a very long interval in
theirs i got just what i deserved
thorne i should have known i must
have wiped out many micro-civiliza-
tions during my experiments

  orbis eyes closed and he lay panting
shallowly and swiftly he couldnt last
much longer that was evident

  just one thing more for me to do
he said the police will never believe
the truth

  thome made no more inquiries
worried about his personal affairs he
held ruth in his arms and waited there
were shouts and cries all over the build-
ing a siren was shrieking in the street
without but by now the fire in orbis
lab should be under control for during
the past few minutes at least a dozen
people had been fighting it

  dane admitted no one to his apart-
ment until a physician arrived with
the latter were two husky cops here
at last was the moment of grim signifi-
cance for thorne and his little daughter

  just what happened here one of
the policemen asked suspiciously glanc-
ing first at thorne and then at orbis

the old experimenters dulling gaze
flashed a warning look at the man
whose daughter had sent three slugs
into his body

  then he chuckled in feeble rasping
satanic glee

  certainly a man has a right to de-
stroy his own property has he not

   asked wildly certainly he has a
  ht to take his own life but this fel-

heard noises of apparatus being broken
he came to see what was the matter
but i held him at bay i made him
help me with the work of destruction
i promised him that he anfl his child
would not leave my laboratory alive
then i gave him the chance which was
part of my plan oh it was a clever
plan in which i foresaw all that would
happen but nothing is difficult for a
sceintist as great as theodore orbis

  i let thorne wrest the pistol from
me and then i seized the little girl
and said i would tear her to peices
what thome did then was natural
he fired three shots into my back i
have done that which no man has ever
done before i have achieved suicide

histrionic confession which branded
him with the false stamp of insanity
ended in a weak though horrible fit of
coughing black blood poured in a tor-

feelings of tremendous relief and tre-

was clear there would be little further
investigation now considering orbis
reputation for eccentricity the old
scientist was a brave man this last
fact should be broadcast to the world
but no it never could be and for the
sake of countless living worlds hidden
behind the veil of incredible minute-

experiment should never be told
