without drastic drugs

  you have  million liny tubes or filter in your kidneys

wasted and purifying your blood which circulates through your
kidneys  times an hour so its no wonder that poorly func-
tioning kidneys may be the real cause of peeling tired run-

jjown nervous getting up nights rheumatic pains and other
troubles

  nearly everyone is likely to suffer from poorly functioning kid-
neys at times because modern foods and drinks weather changes
exposure colds nervous strain worry and over-work often place
an estra heavy load on the kidneys

  because cheap drastic irritating drugs and neglect may endan-
ger your kidneys you cant afford to tako chances if functional
kidney and bladder disorders make you suffer from getting up

nights leg pains nervousness backache circles under kyes
dizziness loss of energy rheumatic pains stiffness swollen
joints acidity or burning smarting and itching you dont need
to take chances all druggists now have the most modern ad-
vanced treatment for these troubles-a doctors prescription called
cystex pronounced siss-tex

city health doctor
praises cystex

  doctors and druggists in  countries ap-
  prove of the prescription cystex because of
  its splendid ingredients and quick action
  for instance dr w k george for many
  years health commissioner of indianapolis re-
  cently wrote the following letter there is
  little question but what properly functioning
  kidney and bladder organs are tital lo health
  insufficient kidney excretions are the cause of
  much needless buffering with achinc back
  weakness swollen joints and rheumatic
  pains headaches and a generally run-down
  condition cystex definitely corrects frequent
  causes of such conditions and exerts a splendid
  influence in flushing poisons from the urinary
  georue tract

world wide success

  cystex ia not an experiment but is a proven success in 
different countries throughout the world it is prescribed espc
cially for functional kidney and bladder disorders and for thii
reason it is swift sure and safe in action it helps the kidneyi
in their work of cleaning out the blood and removing poisonout
acids and waste in the system and soothes and tones raw sore
irritated bladder membranes cystex is a scientifically prepare
prescription and the formula is ia every package so that youi
doctor or druggist can tell you that it does not contain dope
narcotics or habit-forming drugs

guaranteed to work

  cystex it the only international prescription scientifically pre-

   we step now into  it holds new promise of progress
because of the carefully digested tabulation of expressed desires
during the period we have covered together

    h p lovecraft returns to science-fiction with a three-part
serial at the mountains of madness starting in the february
issue this story is not in exact line with the general run of
science-fiction-but it is good science and it creates one of the finest
word pictures i have ever read you will find solid enjoyment and
much food for thought as you read it

   also scheduled for next month are mathematical by john
russell fearn undoubtedly one of his best efforts to date  cones
by f b long jr death cloud by david r daniels and
buried moon by raymond z gallun

    the creation of an interesting magazine of fiction requires the
intelligent incorporation of many elements you and i have seen
many magazines become monotonous because of sameness that
is the danger which is constant to any magazine where the man
who occupies the editors chair is not an editor-and there are
many such

    if one story appeals unanimously to a reading audience as
great i feel it my duty to avoid another story similar in style and
background lest the very things that made the first appeal destroy
the value of both as interesting reading

    if the story contains the germ of a new and thought-provoking
idea i am prejudiced in its favor thus i classify the isotope
men with its superscientific projection of actual isotope experi-
mentation and strange city with its intriguing electrical life
transfer which links closely to the theory of life held by the late
thomas edison

    to balance this presentation of idea stories we seek and find
an imaginative science-adventure in smothered seas to com-
plete the balance blue magic carries on and the spaceways are
represented and the distant planets and psychological science-
in the shorts

    thus a magazine is made keened and put together stories as
foils for stories contrasts set to emphasize contrasts varied
interests carefully spaced so as not to pall by their sameness

    i have wanted to chat with you about this for a long time and
to-day it just sort of bubbled out i know it will help us to under-
stand each other better what you want me to do-and what im
trying to do are one and the same-the editor
whats this he snapped

its your fuel she said triumphantly i drained the tank
by ralph milne farley
and stanley g weinbaum

       the seas crept with green it crawled
       up the shores and smothered the hills

it was the year  america was
at war fighting for her very life
against the asiatic union and yet
the american people-even army offi-
cers-found time for recreation rec-
reation was a necessity to take ones
mind off the titanic struggle

  lieutenant richard lister clad in
swimming trunks sat on a beach rug
staring moodily out across the pacific
ocean toward the seal rocks and be-
yond his hands clasped across his
tanned knees his bronzed face tense

  lets not talk about the war lets
talk about us he exclaimed to sally
amber who sat beside him

  the girl turned her strange dark
eyes inquisitively upon him

  you shouldnt feel that way dick
she said seriously particularly as
youre in such an important branch of
the service im not kidding i mean
it where would the country be with-
out your bureau of military biology
and bacteriology wed all be wiped
out by the asiatic unions germs

  sure and if it werent for their
bacteriologists theyd be wiped out by
our germs its a deadlock i tell you
like this whole war look at alaska
for more than a year now the khan
has been holding that little corner from
rocky point to cape espenberg and
we havent been able to budge his line
a single inch nor ras he been able to
budge ours each army is protected
by one of those impenetrable beckerley
electrical fields

  alaska is the key to the whole situa-
tion with the khan there in person
if we could just get through his beck-

erley field and put an end to him the
whole asiatic union would crumble
its only his personality that can hold
together such naturally hostile groups
as the siberian russians the japs the
chinese he tartars and so forth
without him theyd be at each others
throats in a few hours

 well why doesnt somebody do
something about it asked sally imp-
ishly

  lord knows weve tried lister ex-
claimed ten or a dozen brave ameri-
cans have gotten through the enemy
lines and tried to assassinate him only
to be captured and subjected to hor-
rible torture and death

  the girl shuddered and pulled one
corner of the beach rug up around her
shoulders

  i dont suppose id rate as a brave
american  she said

  id take a chance on your bravery
lister declared

  why doesnt america land troops
in asia sally asked

  lister stared at her sharply

  you know as well as i do he said
although america controls the seas
ever since we annihilated the khans
fleet off the marianas six months ago
yet he has ten million men under arms
in asia what good would it do us
to land our five million against such
odds no weve got to lick the mad
khan in alaska-somehow

  he isnt mad snapped sally un-
expectedly

 how do you know

  ive-ive-well ive seen him


astounding stories

  i didnt know youd ever been in
asia

  there are lots of things about me
that you dont know she retorted
my father is dead and i am quite
wealthy ive traveled a lot three
years ago i was in the eastern cap-
ital-harbin and whats more ive
been in moscow the western capital
too

  so youve seen the mad khan
mused lister did you ever see the
woman they call princess stephanie 
whats she like shes supposed to be
very beautiful

  sally shrugged oh shes all right
if you like that type she replied airily
shes dark and has khazar blood in
hcjr and shes about my age-and any-
way why are you questioning me go
on with your little lecture

  about us he asked hopefully

  no she reached out one slim
hand and gently patted his knee
about the beckerley electrical fields
what are they how do they operate

  he frowned thoughtfully try-
ing to phrase his answer in words that
a girl would understand

  its an application of morelles ex-
periment with electrical eddy currents
he said im a botanist not an elec-
trical engineer but i know that the idea
involves the refraction of lines of mag-
netic force

  it works like this over each army
on the alafkan front the scientists have
created a dome of electrical tension-
a magnetic field any shell or drop
bomb passing through this magnetic
field is instantly heated to white heat
by the electrical eddy currents induced
in it by the field and is thus caused to
explodfe in mid-air

  every city is likewise protected by
a beckerley field you know how each
auto-copter on leaving the city limits
of san francisco has to stop and be
pushed through an iron-shielded subway

until its oeyond the beckerley field
well thats because the gasoline in the
tank woulci be heated to the flash point
by the walls of its container

  how about solid shot asked sally

  that can pass through a field of
course but what chance has solid shot
of doing much damage our own cop-
ters could down any possible fleet of
enemy planes long before they could
drop enough solid missiles to do appre-
ciable harm to a city and as for the
alaskan front the most that either side
could do would be to chip a few rocks
in the yukon hills

  no the situations a deadlock the
khan is swept from the sea but his
enormous army prevents our invading
asia and neither side can advance an
inch in alaska because of the becker-
ley fields it cant even become a war
of attrition because both the asiatic
union and the united states are en-
tirely self-supporting and can never be
starved intc submission

  do you think so asked sally am-
ber in an odd voice suddenly she
shrugged her smooth brown shoulders
as if to change the subject will ad-
miral allen be here saturday she
asked casually

  why no i dont think- lister

caught himself abruptly allen had told
him in the very strictest of confidence
of a proposed attempt to cut the asiatic
supply line to alaska by a concentrated
attack on behring strait the pacific
fleet idle since the engagement near the
marianas was to sail secretly before
dawn on saturday

  he glared why do you ask such
a question he snapped if i knew
i shouldnt tell and you know it

  sally laughed silly she chided
it was just that i was considering hav-
ing him and you and that flying detec-
tive jim cass to a little dinner at my
apartment saturday you see i still
havent met jim cass and youve
spoken of him so often that im curi-
smothered seas



ous after all if hes a friend of yours

dick- she smiled very tenderly

at him

  lister shook his head captain cass
is no friend of mine he declared
hes just an officer of the military
intelligence who breezes into my labora-
tory from time to time and pokes
around looking for clues and trouble
he gives me the creeps i never knew
such a cold-blooded man hed turn
his own mother over to a firing squad
if he thought it would help win the
war

  well wouldnt you or i do as much
for our country asked sally and
besides his very coldness intrigues me
i want to meet him

  suit yourself said lister have
we time for another swim

  she puckered her lips disapprovingly
oh no  she exclaimed decidedly
the waters so full of that horrible
green slime that its no pleasure to swim
lets start back to town

  it is bad he agreed its just a
variety of conferva-what we com-
monly call algae there have been some
complaints of it in the drinking water
too its harmless but they ought to
chlorinate the city reservoir he rose
and stretched lets dress and get
started then

  it was not quite  p m when
they landed sallys convertible helicop-
ter in front of the building near the
presidio that served as the office and
laboratory of the local unit of the bu-
reau of military biology and bacteri-
ology lister stepped reluctantly out
of the machine and turned to sally at
the wheel

  to-nignt he asked hopefully

  she shook her head sorry i have
to dine with some family friends
to-morrow night then

 i shouldnt i-

but you will he stated positively
heaven knows if ill be stationed here

long and i dont want to waste a mo-
ment

  why she asked sharply do you
expect to be transferred

  he bit his tongue no but-

  needed distraction came he whirled
and saluted a dark sinister-looking army
officer descending the steps of the build-
ing

  sally heres captain cass at last
i thought hed be in to-day sir this
is the sally amber youve heard me
talking about so much

  jim cass took the hand sally ex-
tended no wonder dicks been rav-
ing he said staring at her appraisingly
with his cold blue eyes i apologize
for thinking he was nuts i didnt be-
lieve he had the good taste-

  his stare changed to a puzzled frown
say havent we met before

  if we had said sally i wouldnt
have forgotten it

  but captain cass stood staring long
after her copter was indistinguishable
among the cross currents of traffic

  cass was no closer to the solution
when he dropped in on lister the fol-
lowing day the biologist in labora-
tory smock was busy with the war-time
routine of checking water samples from
half a dozen coastal cities and had but
little time to listen to his superior

  oakland he muttered bacterial
count seven per c c thats normal
monterey eleven thats safe vera
cruz-say did you ever see so much
algze in the drinking water look at
that beaker on the window sill thats
after two hours exposure to sunlight
and its as green as pea soup already
whats more i saw reports from chi-
cago that its just the same there and
-this is queer-from london as well
whats that fuzz on the trees
asked cass thoughtfully looking idly
out of the window i never saw that
here before

  yeah i noticed that its just a


astounding stories

tree lichen something like spanish moss
a cryptogamous plant-that is a spore-

breeder its related to- by the

lord its conferva too just like the
algce

  well so what

  so nothing except that whatever
has stimulated the alga in the sea and
in the drinking water has also stimu-
lated the lichens and the fungi the
cryptogamoids are the sort of plants
that grew on earth during the carbonif-
erous age the age of coal

  maybe were in for another age of
coal huh

  hardly said lister laughing
there are several theories as to what
caused the carboniferous age such as
a higher concentration of carbon di-
oxide in the air or a world-wide tropi-
cal climate or intense sun-spot activity
which would induce frequent and vio-
lent electrical storms on the earth and
hence produce an abnormal amount of
ozone in the air ozone is a particularly
dense form of oxygen and is able to

filter out the death rays-

  death rays exclaimed cass prick-
ing up his ears he had been paying
very little attention to lister but here
was something in his own line-some-
thing the military intelligence ought to
know about death rays

  lister laughed again not the kind
of death rays the army is interested in
he said but there are certain invisi-
ble rays of sunlight which have a fatal
effect on living creatures ozone filters
them out

  its one of the remarkable instances
of the balance of nature that there is
normally just enough ozone in the outer
layers of the atmosphere to keep out the
quantity of that invisible light which
would be fatal to human life and yet
let in just enough to keep the alga

within reasonable bounds now if-

say i wonder

  you wonder what

  nothing nothing at all

  lister said cass pointedly you
seem to be able to be very close-mouthed
about some things and to some people
i wonder how you are with women
what do you mean  asked lister
with a guilty premonition

  well for example you didnt hap-
pen to say anything to miss amber
about the sailing of the fleet did you 
lister flushed he hadnt of
course and yet she might have gath-
ered it from some of his remarks but
then what if she had

 of course not he growled
speaking of the fleet he added im
going over to see admiral allen right
now

  arrived at the admirals quarters
lister came directly to the point sir
he said ive leen thinking about all
these algce at the rate they are in-
creasing you may find your whole fleet
stalled in a mass of jelly before you
get to behring strait

  ive thought of that admiral
allen replied soberly and yet with a
twinkle in his eyes which lister couldnt
quite fathom

  but have you heard the latest re
ports sir lister persisted the chi-
cago river is clogged the stuff is
beginning to plug the water mains
everywhere i know its becoming a
nuisance here in san francisco in
texas the spanish moss is beginning
to collect in masses heavy enough to
break tree branches

  all over the country railroad ties
are turning into pulpy beds of assorted
fungi puffballs and a hundred other
varieties the resulting decay has even
caused derailings in the moister areas
trains actually have to plow their way
through vast accumulations of lichens
which have found the shaded cuts and
half-decayed ties an ideal environment
in which to exercise their new vitality
its even worse in asia the ad-
miral replied they say that on the
smothered seas



tundras the lichens are growing into
heaps like haystacks on the railroads
and that the alga have blocked rivers
and caused floods thats why even
at the risk of getting our entire fleet
stuck in the slime we must attack the
khan while this unexplainable growth
of plants is endangering his source of
supplies

  i didnt know that said lister
well keep it under your hat and
dont breathe it to a soul it is secret
information that has just come in from
the intelligence service haveyou any
idea as to the reason for all this i
was just going to send for you when
you showed up

  something may have caused an ab-
normal increase in the ozone of the
outer layers of the atmosphere and this
ozone may be filtering out those wave
lengths of sunlight which ordinarily hold
algie in check

  but admiral allen was one of those
practical men who have little patience
with scientific explanations of anything
so he suggested might it not be some
new device of asiatic warfare

  i hardly think so sir the khan
wouldnt use this weapon which appears
to be hurting him even worse than it
is us

ii

  that evening when dick lis-
ter and sally amber were seated in a
restaurant she again broached the sub-
ject of the algae

  i hear its even worse in asia than
in america she said

  how do you happen to know that
he asked in surprise

  its so then oh everybody isnt
so close-mouthed as you dick she re-
plied demurely she raised her lovely
dark innocent eyes

  do you suppose it might be an
asiatic weapon or perhaps-since it
seems to be even worse in siberia than
here-an american weapon

  embarrassed he mumbled how
should i know

  but you do know something about
it dont you she shot at him

  caught off guard he stumbled eh 
oh-why yes the beckerley fields
- he broke off frowning in irri-
tation

  sally he growled that curiosity
of yours is going to get you into trou-
ble one of these days this is war time
and feminine curiosity is no excuse for
pumping officers i know that you are
o k but others might not trust you
howd you like to stand court-martial
as an asiatic spy jut because you ask
too many questions

  perhaps i am one said the girl
smiling and raising her delicately pen-
ciled brows

  its no joking matter sally peo-
ple have been shot against a wall for
less than that

   i can see said the girl dryly that
captain cass has been lecturing you

  how- began lister then bit

his lip

  how do i know oh i can read
men like a book-any woman can
captain cass doesnt like me and i
dont like men who dont like me

                                        

   she pouted prettily

  im glad he doesnt declared lis-
ter it would suit me if nobody liked
you but me

  he recalled this conversation
the next evening when cass strolled
nosily into his laboratory where he was
working late over some analyses

  nice mess of algfe cass observed
squinting at listers experimental tank
they say the stuff is clogging the at-
lantic harbors

  you could damn near walk across
the golden gate this morning lister
replied and went on to detail the latest
news train schedules disrupted in the
northwest ships stuck in harbors every-


astounding stories

where even in the open seas particu-
larly the north pacific

  but captain cass was not listening
he was leaning over listers glass-
topped desk peering intently at some-
thing beneath the glass-a snapshot
whats this he asked sharply
just a snap of sally not a very
good one prints blurred

  um said cass his eyes nar-
rowed then he said irrelevantly
have you any theory about whats
causing all this growth of algae
yes lister admitted pursing up
his lips judiciously but im not going
off half-cocked when ive verified cer-
tain points i shall report to washing-
ton-not to the intelligence service
well seeing as you wont tell the
intelligence service anything the intel-
ligence service will tell you something
-and for your own good listen care-
fully and dont fly off the handle i
was attached to the harbin legation
three years ago before the war i got
to know a lot about the khans eastern
capital maybe you never heard of the
woman called princess stephanie-or
did you

  yes what about her

  wait a minute stephanie was the
daughter of dmitri kazarov the khans
chancellor he was killed fifteen years
ago in the japanese revolution and the
khan himself took over the raising of
stephanie it wasnt given much pub-
licity but in a town like harbin peo-
ple talk and they were still talking when
i was there it seemed the khan gave
her a queer education-a very queer
one

  what do you mean

   i mean he raised her to be the great-
est spy in history she was taught
every important language and to speak
each like a native she was taught to
be at ease in every situation and every
level of society she learned military
science so as to be able to identify im-
portant information and when it be-

gan to be evident that she was going to
be a very beautiful girl she was even
taught the knowledge of human nature
but above all-above all i say-she
learned to be cold and heartless and
immune to love she can act the part
of a woman in love but there is no
feeling in her-no feeling except the
desire to serve asia

  but i dont see-

  you will when stephanie was six-
teen-that was three years ago when i
was in harbin-the khan forbade her
to appear in public lest foreign resi-
dents learn her features and impair her
usefulness when she rode out-of-
doors no one was permitted within five
hundred feet of her and no one save
her palace intimates really saw her face

  but-cass grinned aggravatingly-
i happen to have extraordinary eye-
sight as a copter observer should and
i used to watch her from the prescribed
distance once i even turned a pair
of night glasses on her she was a
beauty all right

  i begin to suspect sir said lister
grimly that youre about to say some-
thing youre going to be sorry for
perhaps anyway since the war
began there have been a lot of rumors
about a brilliant feminine asiatic spy
-the nightshade its my opinion that
the nightshade is the princess steph-
anie and as for the rest i know only
this-that sally amber looks like
stephanie

  youre utterly insane blazed lis-
ter his voice rose its ridiculous
sallys no asiatic does she look like
an oriental her skin is as white as
marble-when she isnt sun-tanned i
mean her speech is thoroughly ameri-
can her eyes-

  he stopped suddenly he had visual-
ized sally ambers eyes-dark pure
lovely but beyond doubt with the
slightest possible oriental cast

  exactly declared cass in reply to
listers unspoken thought
smothered seas



  lieutenant how long have you
known this girl are you sure that
her tan is tan and not her natural
color and- isnt she about the right
age and doesnt she spend a lot of
time cultivating the friendship of peo-
ple like you who possess important mili-
tary knowledge  whether she gets any-
thing out of you is a different story
but you ought to know whether she
tries whether she ever asks leading
questions or anything like that

  she doesnt snapped lister then
groaned he himself had chided the
girl more than once on her curiosity
look here captain he said if sally
is an enemy spy-its inconceivable-
but if she is i say its america first
with me much as i love her lay off
of her will you and let me find out
im not so hard-boiled and pitiless
as you think

 how do you-

  how do i know what you think of
me because its my business as an
intelligence officer to know what peo-
ple think but as i was saying ill
trust you ill give you your chance
im flying to-night on a certain mission
and shall not return for two days un-
til then the case is in your hands but
if you have not solved it by then i shall
take it over

  listers mental turmoil brooked
no delay despite the fact that if sally
were dining out she must have already
left he rushed across town to her apart-
ment she-or some one at least-
was home for the library lights were
glowing he ignored the slow auto-
matic elevator and dashed up the four
flights of steps to her floor

  he arrived in front of her door
breathless and perspiring there he
paused striving to calm himself

  suddenly he was aware of voices be-
yond the door he listened but it was
impossible to distinguish words he

fancied he heard the tones of a man
but even that was not a certainty

  he rang the bell there was a sud-
den silence in the room beyond and
then after a considerable interval the
sound of footsteps sally herself
opened the door her face seeming
strained and tense but she smiled as
she recognized lister

  dick she exclaimed whats the
matter youre breathless

  he strode past her the room was
empty of occupants save for sally and
himself to whom were you talk-
ing he asked grimly

  i was using the televisiphone
why  

  i thought i heard a mans voice in
the room here

  dick she said reprovingly i had
no idea your jealousy would lead to
such imaginings she looked up at
him with her dark eyes sober you
know you have no cause to be jealous
it isnt that he replied miserably
suddenly he burst out sally what
were you doing in harbin three years
ago 

  if there was a momentary flicker in
her eyes it was almost imperceptible
why i was traveling you know i
love to travel	

 you say you saw the woman
stephanie there he pursued did any
one ever tell you that you looked like
her

  decidedly her eyes widened now
why-yes of course ive heard that

but dick you dont think- she

laughed how absurd you dont
think that im the nightshade do you
who said anything about the night-
shade he snapped how did you
know that stephanie and the nightshade
are the same person 

  why everybody hears those ru-
mors dick

  you mean that you hear everybodys
rumors he returned grimly why
are you so interested in everything that


astounding stories

has to do with the war or the service-
everything from fleet sailings to algze
sally youre not telling me the truth
how ridiculous she indignantly
declared then suddenly her mood
changing she moved close to him look-
ing up at him out of innocent dark
eyes you trust me dont you
heaven knows i want to

  her lovely provocative lips smiled
then kiss me she whispered

  he obeyed fiercely as always her
lips burned like soft fire but suddenly
she threw back her head and thrust her
hands against him as though to push
away from his embrace one of her
scarlet finger nails drew a sharp gash
across his throat with hurt surprise
in his eyes he released her

  you-were hurting me she ex-
plained apologetically but her eyes
were watching him like a cat im
sorry i scratched you

  its nothing he muttered he felt
curiously dizzy-no wonder he thought
in the grip of such violent and opposing
emotions but abruptly he found him-
self sitting in a chair with his head on
his hands and the room seemed to
gyrate around him like the cabin of a
copter

  through a haze of dizziness he heard
a mans voice and then sallys in an-
swer no no she said this was
much better if id- called you there
would have been a fight and a disturb-
ance and see how peacefully he sinks
into stupor 

  i bow to you kazarovna said the
man there is but one stephanie

  i am glad that it turned out as it
did said sallys voice he is the one
who knows about the algae and now
asia shall know

iii

  when next lister was aware of a
world about him it was a world of a
most unstable nature minutes passed

before he realized that he was in a plane
soaring over an apparently endless ex-
panse of brilliant white clouds there
was a further interval before he per-
ceived that sally amber was sitting
calmly smoking beside the man who
piloted the machine and that he him-
self was handcuffed very effectively to
the aluminum arms of his seat his
head ached dully then full realiza-
tion dawned upon him he was a pris-
oner in the hands of agents of the khan

  his movement caught the girls at-
tention she rose and made her way
to the seat facing him

  i hope youre not feeling too ill
she said gently im sorry dick
drugging you was necessary

  then its true he groaned you
are the nightshade-a sneaking asiatic
spy

  like a sneaking american spy she
retorted dick i serve my country in
the best way i can just as you and that
cass person and the rest of the ameri-
cans serve yours

  she smiled hes a clever fellow
that captain cass im afraid his sus-
picions will damage my value in amer-
ica

  well not until- he bit his lip

and hurried on of course he will
hell get those snapshots i have of you
and turn them over to his department
youre cooked as a spy from now on
sally

  oh not that bad she said you
forget that every picture you have of
me was taken with my camera my
camera is a very queer little mechanism 
when i use it it takes sharp clear pic-
tures but when my friends use it some-
how the prints seem to come out
blurred or hadnt you noticed that 

  he had of course he asked glumly
where are we headed for

  asia said sally

  yeah i thought so since were in
a plane instead of a copter pound
for pound and horse power for horse

             ast-
smothered seas



power lister knew that the planes were
still more efficient than the copters and
the fact that sally was using a plane
meant a long flight

  why he asked after a moments
silence

  dont you know because we have
to have certain information from you
im sure it wont do any good to offer
you safety for it dick but i can prom-
ise if it makes any difference to you
it doesnt he responded grimly i
wont sell my country for my personal
safety anyway i havent the least idea
what information you think i can give
you your bacteriologists are as good
as ours our epidemics havent been any
more successful than yours

  she shook her soot-black hair not
bacteriology nor epidemics dick-
alga

  algae why

  because you know the causes of this
plague of slime in water and lichens
on land its an american weapon and
asia needs the secret it means every-
thing-everything to us

  indeed he said guardedly why
everything

  dont act so innocent dick you
know quite well what the plague of
lichens is doing in siberia its clog-
ging the rail lines and the algse is block-
ing the rivers you know how impor-
tant it is to keep our alaskan expedi-
tionary force supplied with coal arid oil
to power the beckerley fields and you
know that if our fields fail for lack of
fuel the wars over were licked

  you americans use alaskan coal
but our coal has to come all the way
from the stanovoi mountains either
by water across the sea of okhotsk
or by rail up through dezhnev and
its becoming impossible to keep the rails
open  siberia is being strangled by your
accursed lichens

  well what about the water route
water ships are stalled all over
the seven seas look there

 ast-

  he glanced through the floor window
at the pacific five thousand feet below
visible now through a vast opening in
the clouds the sea had a curious
aspect it was not blue but brilliant
grass-green peering closer he made
out two tiny vessels idle on the surface

  as bad as that he muttered won-
dering what was happening to allens
mighty fleet would the admiral at-
tempt to cross the choked ocean to
sally he said thats fine the more
strangled siberia gets the better it suits
me

  for the first time in their acquaint-
ance a sign of irritation showed in her
face it wont be for long she
snapped angrily well get the secret
out of you make no mistake about
that dick 

  and you he said thoughtfully are
sweet little sally amber who said that
she loved me

  suddenly her face was gentle and
if i do love you she murmured if
i do would that make a difference to
you dick

  he laughed bitterly do you think
id believe you now i know all about
princess stephanie and her education
if you love anybody at all its the
khan

  not the khan but asia she said
the khan is nothing to me except
for what he means to my country for
he himself dick trained me from child-
hood to be immune to love and yet
-and yet dick-i have never met a
man whom i-like-as i do you you
mean less to me than asia but more to
me than any human being in the world
and that he sorrowfully asserted
is another one of your pretty lies

  for a long moment she was silent
no it isnt a lie she said at last
rising and returning to her place be-
side the pilot

 she addressed not another
word to lister until seven hours later


astounding stories

when they were soaring over honshu
and snow-ripped fujiyama slid beneath
then she returned to the seat facing
him smiled very gently and said softly
i am terribly unhappy about this
dick

  humph he said you ought to
be triumphant

  but im not listen to me dick

  you ought to have thought of that
last night

  but i can save you from it if
youll tell me what i want to know about
the plague of algae and lichens ill
guarantee your safety isnt that the
best way-for both of us

  no sally im not saying that i
have the information you want but you

it was sickening-disgusting-the slow heaving of the slime-
as if the vast expanse were breathing

the khans intelligence division is not
gentle a number of the operatives are
mongols and their methods of extract-
ing information do not include kindness
it hurts me to think of you under tor-
ture dick 

can be sue that whether i have it or
not it never tell asia anything that
might help

  she sighed and left him but her glo-
rious dark eyes were troubled they
were still troubled when the great
smothered seas



khingan range loomed on the horizon
and the plane slanted down into har-
bin she even seemed to pale when at
last a slant-eyed guard took the key
from her and released lister from his
seat and she followed the grim parade
as half a dozen men herded him into
the centuries-old stone fortress that
served as a military prison

  she did not enter the dark stone-
walled cell but as the door swung shut
lister glimpsed her pale face in the
corridor her lips formed a silent
phrase he could have sworn that it was
im sorry

  well it was too late now for her
sorrow to help him even if he believed
in its sincerity and he smiled bitterly

as he thought of the wild mistake that
had led to his abduction the algse and
the lichens i asia strangling in the grip
of a plague that arose from so simple
a cause that-if he told-a schoolboy
could see the remedy

  luckily for america the cryptogams
flourished most luxuriantly in asia
and until he told all advantage lay with

the western continent until he told
he ceased to smile and set his jaw
grimly he was not going to tell tor-
ture or none he had to be strong enough
to keep silent

  hours passed he heard conversa-
tions in the corridor outside but they
were in some asiatic tongue and meant
nothing to him then a chance colloquy


astounding stories

in lingua franca told him that the khan
was not in harbin but was still with
the troops on the alaskan front at
last a guard brought him a jug of water
slimy-green with algae and a slab of
coarse bread but this man a mongol
spoke neither english nor lingua
franca or at least refused to speak
them

  it was deep night when four grim
orientals and a stolid siberian led him
from his cell to a chamber that seemed
sunk far under ground a single dim
electric light illuminated it and a dozen
pairs of cold eyes surveyed him-and
one pair that was not cold sally am-
ber sat at the head of the narrow table
and she met his gaze with eyes that were
wide troubled and apprehensive

  then she addressed him dick she
said softly i have told the interlocu-
tory committee that you will give them
what knowledge you have concerning
this plague of mosses and algae they
have promised me your safety if you
tell and i have assured comrade plot-
kin that you would

  then as usual you lied said lis-
ter grimly

  plotkin spoke out of the depths of
his beard you see kazarovna he
rumbled only one method works with
these stubborn american apes i think
it best we try that method

  oh nol gasped sally amber let
me question him first hell tell me i

can get it from him please- she

broke off suddenly as plotkins icy eyes
surveyed her curiously

  will you tell he asked lister and
then at the latters stubborn silence
very well the pincers under the arm-
pits first i think an ounce or so of
flesh from the proper places can some-
times unblock the stream of informa-
tion

 sally-or stephanie-choked back
a sob and covered her eyes the four
mongol guards forced listers arm up-

ward  for a moment he struggled but
realized instantly that it was utterly use-
less the stolid siberian seized a glit-
tering little instrument and the pincers
tore a ragged tatter of flesh from his
armpit he bit his lip fiercely to sup-
press the groan of pain that sought ut-
terance but there was no sound in the
chamber save sallys stifled sob

  whv so unstrung kazarevna
asked plotkin amiably surely the
princess stephanie has witnessed more
extreme measures than this

  she smiled wanly of course its
just that i havent yet recovered from
my sojourn in america-a-a horrible
place

  plotkin nodded and turned back to
lister shall we try it again he
smiled or would you prefer a varia-
tion 

  neither said the biologist ill
tell impassively he met the startled
relieved unbelieving eyes of sally if
she was acting he thought it was cer-
tainly good acting

  good-good rumbled plotkin
youre much wiser-or at least less
stubborn-than some of your country-
men whom we have found it necessary
to question now then let us hear the
secret

  youd better take this down care-
fully said lister its rather intri-
cate

  he waited as plotkin spoke in rus-
sian to a man at his side then began
the plague of algae and lichens he
said slowly is due to the great in-
crease in numbers of thallogens if the
conferva were checked the trouble
would disappear

  and what barked plotkin are
thallogens 

  thallogens are the third grand di-
vision of the cryptogamia the group
consists of the ulvae and fuci besides
the confervse

  cant vou put -that in understand-
able language snapped plotkin
smothered seas



  i can express scientific information
only in the language of science said
lister his eyes on sallys fascinated
one your own scientists will have
to translate it for you

  is that all asked the siberian
eagerly

  that is all reduce the conferve
and there will be less thallogens and
when there are less thallogens the alga
and lichens will cease to trouble you
its really very simple

  take him back to his cell rumbled
plotkin and this had better be true
my friend unless you crave further
treatment

  every word of it is true lister
asserted

  it was still deep night when three
hours later the door of his cell opened
pj a slim figure slipped stealthily in
for a moment he thought it was a boy 
hm he recognized sally wearing the
hort- and rolled hose of a copterman
sr dosed the door quietly behind her
then rushed abruptly into his arms

  i cant stand it she sobbed why
did you do it plotkin is furious-in-
sane with rage hell have you rotted

bit by bit with acid hell-hell-

why did you trick him dick

  lister looked down into her white
face is this acting too he asked
coolly after all the princess steph-
anie the nightshade isnt supposed to
be able to care what happens to a man
but i do i love you dick i care
for nothing except you and asia but
i cant bear to see you killed or tor-
tured even for asia she paused sup-
pressing her sobs

  plotkin is wild she said he
wired z copy of your statement to the
university at tsitsihar and back came
the scornful reply that all that your
words meant was that the plague of
algae is due to an increase in the amount
of alga

  he smiled well isnt that true
  yes but- oh dick its becom-

ing horrible theyve kept the cities
supplied with water by adding calcium
chloride to the supply but all through
the country-all through the world i
guess-wells are choked and rivers
smothered and oceans have become
heaving masses of slime and on land
the mosses spread like flames of gray
fire

  he was still suspicious though he
held the girl tightly in his arms is
this an attempt to play on my sympa-
thies he asked i warn you sally
ill tell you nothing

  i dont care whether you do or not
dont you understand dick i love
you

  if you love me youll help me escape
from here

  she pushed herself out of his arms
and stared at him with indignation at
his disbelief and why else do you
think i came she asked in a very low
voice follow me quickly before
plotkin cools down enough to put his
mind on the details of your torture

  she stepped to the door rapping
sharply it opened instantly and they
passed into the dim corridor beside a
young russian guard who looked at
sally with tragic eyes she spoke
softly the man extended hisbared arm
and the girl scratched it hastily with
one of her finger nails lister watched
the man as he sank slowly into a limp
sprawl on the floor

  thus it will seem like american
trickery she whispered but i am
afraid he will die for treason none the
less

  why did he do it

  because she said simply he
loves me

  lister followed her up-a narrow
flight of stone steps wondering how
many of the barred doors in the corri-
dor hid american prisoners at last
she paused wait here she whis-


astounding stories

pered and moved from his view along
a passage

   he heard a low-voiced conversation
 in chinese and then sally was at his
 side again come on she called
 softly ive sent this one with a fake
 message to plotkin

   lister followed her up yet another
 flight of steps and emerged suddenly

	into starlight they had attained the
 roof of the structure and he glanced
 apprehensively at the lights of harbin
 all around sally was slipping toward
 a copter a tiny single-man observer
 quick she breathed get in
 both of us he frowned doubt-
 fully at the tiny craft

   we must for i have to show you
 what to do this alone would not carry
 you far

   he crowded in beside her the tiny
 cabin swung like a pendulum as the
 vertical screw whirred and whined and
 bored its way heavily aloft sally
 flashed her green passage light waiting
 anxiously for the reply from the
 ground

   there she exclaimed in relief
 theyve turned off this section of the
 beckerley field i have a pass but if
 they had discovered your escape they
 might have blocked all passage-espe-
 cially mine i think for i am sure that
 plotkin has ceased to trust me

   the craft whined into darkness the
 lights of the city diminished and
 dimmed and at last sally relaxed
 leaning more comfortably against him
 in the close quarters of the cabin

   were beyond searchlights at last
 she said now theyll have to wait
 until dawn to pursue us and by dawn
 we might be anywhere in this half of
 asia for all that they can tell if this

 corkscrew only holds together-

   it did when the red sunrise flashed
 up on the sea they were directly over
 a narrow promontory that struck south
 into the waters lister gasped as he
 saw those waters for surely this was

the most amazing sea ever glimpsed by
earthly eyes at least since the plesio-
saur looked over the oceans of the car-
boniferous age hundreds of millions of
years ago

  it was a brilliantly smooth green sea
seeming at first as motionless as turf
but as the copter dropped towartl the
beach lister could distinguish motion
a slow heaving of the slime as if the
vast expanse were breathing there
were no breakers for the algae had at
last tamed storm and wind and the
seas permitted the wind to slip as
smoothly above them as if the waters
had been covered with a film of oil
the one thing that sent a tremor of
disgust through lister was the sight of
sea birds stalking dismally over a crust
of slime that had dried enough to sup-
port them gobbling up billions of flies

  sally wasted not a glance on the
scene the south cape of taiwan
she said as the copter grounded on a
slimy beach or as you call it formosa
theres a boat here-

  a boat how can we use a boat-
in that

  listen a moment in that shed
theres one of the experimental side-
wheelers a quick adaptation by our sci-
entists who had foreseen this outcome
if the algae were not checked side-
wheels can push a light hull right over
the algae they dont foul like pro-
pellers this one has a dynoline en-
gine and a range of about a thousand
miles

  a thousand miles i cant get any-
where on that

  you can get as far as i want you
to get she retorted with narrowed
eyes you can reach hongkong-
thats british-or you can make hai-
phong in french indo-china hong-
kong is muclthe closer

  but theyre neutral ill be in-
terned if i go into a neutral port i
smothered seas



want to get back to america and my
job

  and i said sally softly want to
see to it that you dont im being
enough of a traitor to asia now with-
out letting a dangerous enemy like you
return to rervice all i want is to see
you safe dick

  she turned away and he followed
her to the shed she had pointed out
there was the boat true enough a
thirty-foot open affair with six-foot
paddle wheels like a miniature old mis-
sissippi side-wheeler

  do you see this asked the girl
indicating a curious device of twisted
glass tubiiig thats a sun-alembic
you put sea water in it and the evapo-
ration creates a partial vacuum in which
the sea water can be distilled for drink-
ing the sun does it just as it does
with the rain

  under here is concentrated food for
about a month can you take care of
a dynoline engine if the algce clog the
cooling coils you must stop and clean
them at once

  i know all that but what about you
sally will you be safe after this

  i can take care of myself her
tone was confident enough but lister
could see that she was under a terrific
strain in this struggle between duty
and desire oh dick she said shak-
ily if this war is ever over-

  it wont be long now as soon as
the khans supply of fuel to alaska
fails him hes ended

  ah but hes laying- she caught

herself flushing miserably

  laying a pipe line eh finished
lister i rather thought he would
hell power the beckerley fields with
oil eh 

  sally laughed bitterly the down-
fall of the nightshade she declaimed
no wonder they fear love in a spy
dick that is the first slip that ive ever
made and my one consolation is that
long before you can get to any place

from where you could send that infor-
mation to america it will be too late
the work will be completed and pro-
tected by fields and so-good-by

  with the feel of her lips still on his
he watched the copter flutter its way
into the north then turned to the craft
he was to use whose only name was a
chinese ideograph it slid easily into
the slip and without further hesita-
tion he started the engine engaged the
paddles and was on his way

  his progress was a queer species of
locomotion the blades threw up vast
lumps of green slime that fell behind
with sullen splashless plumps and the
light craft thrust forward by the in-
credibly powerful dynoline engines slid
easily along the surface of the magot-
infested slime it was not unduly slow
he judged that the boat made twenty-
five knots

  formosa was a receding shadow when
he passed the first stalled ship this
was a dutch freighter and the crew
-or what was left of them since many
had doubtless been put ashore by cop-
ter-crowded the rail to watch his pas-
sage he waved but there was never
a sign of response

  suddenly he realized the cause of the
grim silence his craft bore gold and
purple stripes-the colors of the khan
-and the dutch with borneo celebes
and new guinea in the very shadow of
the vast asiatic union had no love for
the khan

  his coil clogged and he paused to
clean the slime from the screens it
was at this moment that the idea struck
him he sat suddenly erect staring east-
ward where the china sea met the
mighty pacific why did he have to
go to hongkong or haiphong-or any
neutral port for that matter

  what other possibilities were there
he glanced at the map of the east in-
dies affixed to the cowl of the motor
there was luzon of course but the
philippines during their half century


astounding stories

of independence had grown far closer
to asia in sympathy than to the united
states

  there were the marianas where ad-
miral allen had all but annihilated the
asiatic fleet and where surely there
must be an american garrison if he
could but reach them but the mari-
anas lay two thousand miles out in the
pacific close to guam he had fuel for
half that distance but-

  he swung the craft about and set
it lurching back toward the dutch
freighter the maintenance crew
watched him sullenly as he approached
he pulled close under the hull and
shouted any of you understand eng-
lish

  a man pushed to the rail yes
what do you want

  listen im american not asian
look

  he was not in uniform since the
biological branch did not require it but
he displayed his identification tag with
its red-white-and-blue shield plainly
visible

  there was a stir what do you
want asked the man above him but
in friendlier tones

  just some information i want to
know if theres an american or british
ship stalled between here and guam
i want to buy some fuel you been
in touch with any

  there was a long conversation in
netherlands dialect at last listers in-
formant spoke again de britisher
resolute-she stuck-by latitude  
and longitude 

  lister looked at his map marking the
position it would do it was almost
exactly a thousand miles east of his
present position and might be a close
gamble with his fuel but it was worth
the try if he reached the britisher
and got fuel he could then certainly
make guam or the marianas and give

to the american army the news that the
lichens had blocked the siberian rail-
roads thus cutting off the fuel supply
to the khans alaskan beckerley fields
but that the khan was frantically lay-
ing a pipe line

  between the giving out of the khans
coal supply and the arrival of his first
oil there might be a brief gap of time
during which his beckerley fields would
be dead if america only knew this
and could strike then the war would
be won lister must try to get the
information to america in time

  so he set the boat lurching away into
the east little by little the dutch
ship faded toward the horizon and for-
mosa was a dark cloud sinking ever
lower at last he was alone on a dead
green sea that barely moved and his
passage left no wake save a slightly
darker green scraping that slowly closed
behind him no fin cut the slimy sur-
face and but few birds soared for
their slime-bred prey was too abundant
to draw them far from land

  he set his course carefully on a great
circle to conserve his fuel the mal-
odorous slime sickened him with its
stench the perpetual lurching of his
craft added to his nausea day faded
into a starry darkness and darkness into
day

 he made it at the second mid-
night with scarcely a pint of dynoline
remaining in his tank the lights of the
resolute flashed out of the darkness

  but convincing the captain was al-
most as difficult a job as the passage
itself

  its deuced irregular that official
grunted were neutrals but at
last because england had india and
papua and the malay states and hated
asia and all its component parts by
tradition and policy the british cap-
tain acceded to listers request and lis-
ter set out again with a full tank

  he had tried to get the captain to
smothered seas



send a code message by radio to america
for him but to that the captain had
proved adamant

iv

 early next morning on
glancing back he spied a plane wing-
ing swiftly out of the shadows that still
clouded the west and the distant china
seas soon it arrived and circled far
above him then slanted downward in
a  wide spiral the double-headed
golden eagle of the khans air force
glittered on its wing

  the machine swung close an arm
waved vigorously gesturing in the di-
rection of the west the pilot was
ordering him back

  lister stared with narrowed eyes but
permitted his boat to jog right ahead
he was not going to be turned back
so easily as that all the same he had
a feeling anything but comfortable for
he was completely at the mercy of the
asiatic aviator should the latter choose
to use bullet or bomb

  the plane circied again suddenly
lister realized with a start of amaze-
ment that the craft was attempting to
land-to alight on that sticky mass of
heaving slime it was impossible

  but the plane seemed able to achieve
the impossible its pontoons skipped
lightly over the treacherous stuff bound-
ing toward him it was all but down
safely and then-then the inevitable
either the plane dipped or the sea
heaved-lister could not tell which-
and the idling propeller struck a mass
of green slime very gently the plane
lifted its tail and nosed over the green
corruption spewing from the spinning
blades and the pilot-for a single
instant lister had a clear view of the
form that was catapulted through the
air-was plunged into the impassive
alga all that remained was a quickly
filling depression and the sinking plane

  but he had seen enough sally
amber it was sally who struggled
somewhere in the depths of that nau-
seating sea and he-he was as help-
less to aid her as though he were a
thousand miles away

 he spun the wheel the boat
bounced and jogged toward the spot
as near as he could bring it without dis-
turbing the gradually closing dent in
the slimy surface of the sea he halted
the craft he seized the twenty-foot
rope fastened to the bow and tied one
end of the-rope firmly around his arm
then fixing his gaze on the spot he
plunged down into the slime

  it was like trying to swim in heavy
oil to move his arms at all required
a great effort and then he was not sure
whether he was going down or up or
sidewise or was just churning the
stuff clogged his nose his eyes his ears
-even his mouth when in an unguarded
moment he opened it

  his hand struck something solid it
was an instant before he realized that
it was sallys ankle he clutched it in
a grasp of desperation and gave a yank
on the rope tied to his arm pulling in
on the rope was difficult as he had only
one free hand with which to work
once he lost hold of the rope in the
slime and had to start all over again
groping along it from where it was tied
to his arm

  he scarcely knew when he reached
the surface so thick was the coating
of muck he carried with him he thrust
the girl across the gunwale- and then
had to stop to clear his nose and mouth
before he could even breathe he
clambered into the boat

  sally was not unconscious but her
nausea made her almost as green as the
algee she clawed out of her eyes

  thank you dick she said for
the rescue im ashamed that i needed
it

  why are you here sally

  her eyes hardened a bit why are


astounding stories

you here dick i told you to make
for hongkong or haiphong

   but i didnt promise to sally
perhaps not but do you think i
can let you get to an american ship
or port with the information you have
its bad enough that i let it slip and
that i helped you to escape but i will
not play traitor to asia any further
than that do you understand 

  howd you find me

   it occurred to me after i left you
that you might try just what you did

i got back to harbin before plotkin
thought of connecting me widi your
escape-if hes thought of it yet-so i
was able to get a plane i flew over
the china sea between taiwan and
hongkong until i was sure you werent
on that route then i flew east

   for two days ive been scouring this
area you see i anticipated that youd
head for guam but now dick youre
going where i say were going back
to luzon the philippines are neutral
but theyre friendly to asia so i can
have you interned there and yet with
a little influence go free myself start
your engine

  he did the boat took up its east-
ward course

  turn about she snapped when
he merely smiled she reached suddenly
into the bosom of her aviators shirt
and produced a tiny japanese auto-
matic one of the diminutive nine-cali-
ber but deadly with its high-velocity
chrome-jacketed bullets put about
dick

  with a movement so casual that she
was caught completely off guard he
kicked the weapon from her hand and
it spun off into the slime we go
my way sally he said quietly

  she sobbed i ought to have killed
you but i couldnt and this is the
result

  abruptly she turned her glorious
deep eyes upon him dick do you

know what will happen to me if you
take me to guam you know what
they do to spies do you want me to
be shot against a wall

  lord he muttered i didnt think
of that listen sally the pelew
islands are japanese and theyre not
far off my course im going to land
you there about midnight and youre
going to be thoroughly bound and very
tightly gagged so you cant rouse any
pursuit after the war is over maybe
you will forgive me

  i forgive you now dick she said
softly but with a puzzling note in her
voice the nightshade is dead im
no good as a spy when youre involved
but i warn you that i shall still try
to defeat you

  he swung the boat onto its new
course if you can sally

  suddenly he noticed something
which altered all his plans staring out
over the horrible slimy sea he noticed
a change in addition to the green
there were now vast patches of brown
-of dying algie

  for a moment he failed to grasp the
significance of this then so suddenly
that sally jumped he shouted i see
it all now  it has happened

  wh-what

  the khans beckerley fields are off
in alaska his siberian railroads are
blocked at last by the fungi hes out
of fuel it cant be our fields that are
off for our coal mines are too close
behind our lines to be cut off in this

   f

way

  how can you know that any beck-
erley fields are off asked sally

  the-the- he caught himself

then proceeded were not going to
pelew island after all were going to
guam this information cant wait
for if the american lines know it and
advance at once the wars over our
beckerley fields are on and yours are
off
smothered seas



  how-how do you know

   ill tell you for it cant do any harm
now you wanted to know what i
knew about this plague of algae didnt
you well ill tell you sally it isnt
an american weapon its an accident
an-accident

  yes or a by-product its the re-
sult of the beckerley fields i got the
hunch when i learned that the center
of the trouble seemed to be alaska up
in alaska there are two enormous fields
of force within a few hundred feet of
each other ours and yours between
them is a hundred-mile-long zone of
terrific electrical strain whats the re-
sult ozone tons of ozone pour-
ing up into the air until the very en-
velope of air around the earth was
affected

  the normal ozone content increased
and this layer of ozone around the earth
cut off the suns death rays which had
been maintaining the balance of nature
relieved from the restraining influence
of the death rays the cryptogamia-
the lichen and fungi and algae-in-
creased to abnormal quantities

  but its over now ozone is un-
stable and goes rapidly back to normal
the ozone in the air is decreasing the
death rays are getting through again

  how do i know  because the algae
are dying and that can mean only one
thing-that there are no longer two
beckerley fields opposing each other in
alaska pouring ozone into the air
there is only one beckerley field-ours
the khans shield is gone and all we
need do is advance

  sally was very pale now i wish
you hadnt told me this she whispered
oh dick dont you see that it means
that i just have to stop you if you
love me rhrow me into the slime of
the sea for id rather die than live these
next few hours trying to kill you

  his triumphant face sobered
hours he echoed it will take us
three days to reach guam sally when

i need sleep im going to tie you up
and i hope you dont resist because
lord knows i dont want to hurt you

  but she yielded quite submissively
when a few hours later he twisted the
painter rope about her wrists and an-
kles he remembered her trick of the
drugged finger nail and carefully
avoided giving her another similar op-
portunity then he set and locked the
gyro steering compass and curled up
on one of the seats to sleep

  when he awoke the boat was still
slapping along across the slime sally
was stil securely tied and apparently in
the same position but the bottom of
the boat was wet with some colorless
fluid

  whats this he snapped

  its your fuel said sally trium-
pljantly i drained the tank

  he gasped but in a moment he
broke out in a chuckle of relief that
isnt dynoiine he said thats the
fresh water from the sun-alembic i was
saving against a cloudy day the wa-
ter tanks air-tight and the alga cant
get in

  sally sagged despondently in her
place will you untie me  she asked
dully im very cramped

 he ventured an attempt to
sleep only once more and this time
lying full length against the fuel tank
while he bound sally not only hand and
foot butiashed her to the gunwale as
well and when he awakened she had
kicked the sun-alembic to bits

  whyd you do that he asked an-
grily although we dont need water
for the one day thats left to travel it
would be a convenience

  i did it so that if we miss guam
well be dead before some scouting
american plane happens to run across
us

  we wont miss guam he promised
grimly

  as the hot stinking day wore on the


astounding stories

grueling- grind began to tell on lister
all about them the algse was turning
brown anil the stench was almost un-
bearably nauseating

  im going bats he told the girl
a crazy poem keeps hammering at my
head ive got to pass it on or i shall
go bats did you ever hear the short-
short-short story about algy all this
rotting alg is what suggested it to me
i guess

  sally turned intent catlike eyes on
him aroused from her lethargy by the
possibility of his cracking

  go on tell it to me she urged
insidiously

  he laughed harshly discordantly
gave his head a violent shake and ran
the back of his hand across his tired
eyes

  it goes like this he said

           bear met algy

             bear et algy

             bear was bulgy

             bulge was algy

  suddenly he gave a wild laugh
thats all wrong this time he de-
clared by heaven the bear isnt
eating algy this time algae is eating
the bear-the siberian bear weve got
them licked if we ever reach guam

  we never will reach guam the
girl taunted him

  wont we he exclaimed look
a low shore line showed in the dark-
ening east guam he announced
sober and sane once more

  sally was disconsolate ive lost
then she whimpered please dick
be kind to me and-let me kiss you
now in case anything happens

  he knew what she meant he had
worried enough over the question of
what would happen to the lovely night-
shade  for despite his assurance he
knew that captain cass was aware of
sallys identity the two days of grace
were long since up cass would have

reported the circumstances of listers
disappearance

  cass description of sally together
with the murred photographs in lis-
ters office would certainly identify the
girl nothing could save her from a
wall at sunrise so he drew her into
his arms with a tenderness bora of
despair

  just in time he realized her intent
he caught her wrist as she struck with
her drugged finger nail at his throat

  damn you sally lie blazed now
im going to give you a dose of your
own medicine theres only one way
youre safe to have around and thats
unconscious

  but she read his purpose before he
could seize her forefinger she had
clenched it into a stubborn little fist
and she fought him with a strength that
was amazing but at last he saw the
way disregarding her blows against his
face he slowly inexorably crushed her
clenched fist in his hand she cried
out in pain as her own finger nails were
driven into the flesh of her palm and
then suddenly her eyes widened flut-
tered and closed and she sank first to
her knees then in a limp heap at his
feet

 it was deep night when he
carried her up the side of the u s
cruiser dallas tailed in the algas off
agana thrusting her into the arms
of the ships surgeon he rushed to re-
port to the commanding officer his
information hat he knew from the
browning of the algse that the khans
alaskan beckerley field was off the
message did not need to wait for cod-
ing for america still held the secret of
non-intereeptible radio

  scarcely an hour later came back the
news that america had triumphed in
alaska

  later in the night came the flash that
the khan was dead-his body had been
smothered seas



positively identified america broad-
cast this news to the world

  by morning rioting and dissension
had broken out all over asia the
asiatic union was disintegrating it
was the beginning of the end

  there was jubilation aboard the dal-
las but dick lister could not share in
it true yes he had saved america
he was a great national hero the
president in person had radioed his
thanks

  so dick lister pretended to be
elated to join in the celebration-for
of course he had to but through it
all two fa-es haunted him the piquant
oriental features of the girl he loved
and the grim inexorable duty-mad
features of captain cas regardless
of the fact that the war was now over
and won regardless of the part which
lister had played in winning it cass
would never rest until he had brought
death to the archspy of the late enemy

  and so as soon as he could lister
broke away from the jollification and
dragged his leaden feet toward the ships
hospital there he stood with the ships
doctor looking down on the still un-
conscious sally

  a very beautiful girl your fiancee
said the doctor

  yes we were kidnaped together

by the khans spies and she was really
more important than i in accomplish-
ing our escape this is just exhaustion
-and of course excitement but he
knew that captain cass would certainly
spike that story

  well observed the doctor your
coming is almost the first excitement
ive had out of this war i hope youre
right about the algae being over for its
been ungodly dull being stuck here in
all this slime one casualty is all ive
seen and that one at a distance a
young officer tried to land his plane on
the algee a week ago nosed over and
was lost they never recovered his
body

  its a difficult thing to do-find a
body in that green muck said lister
reminiscently who was he

  he was-lets see-a captain jim
cass wtr knew who it was cause wed
been expecting him

  captain jim cass a week ago
then cass had never returned to
america he had died before the end
of the two days of grace which he had
granted lister and his knowledge of
sallys identity had died with him now
no one would ever know

  with a sob of joyous relief dick lis-
ter dropped to his knees beside the sleep-
ing form of the girl he loved

 by j harvey haggard

i should never have come to
these bad lands in venus omar
my dream was glamorous and
beautiful back there on earth when i
had only your radioed letters and my
vision of the worlds among the stars

  how was i to know what a lonely

crystal traders life would be out here
so far from the american sett nents
among those horrible little natives its
enough to drive one mad mad i tell
you and yet youve brought this wiz-
ened little moon pixy here to die before
my eyes
moon crystals



  the man kicked the metal door shut
on the fog that reached in after his wet-
slickered form and stood holding the
tiny native in his arms as though he
were a child there was a dark bruise
on the mans lean cheek

  omar klegg slipped the transparent
sheathing down from his face and said
im sorry enid somethings hap-
pened you cant stay here ive got
to get you out of here

  he might have said that he hadnt
asked her to come to venus in the first
place she was beautiful but she looked
almost fragile in the faint greenish tinge
of venusian atmosphere with the trans-
parent rose-colored collar flared about
her tiny blond head and blue-eyed little
face and venus wasnt for fragile
earth folk either man or woman

   the collar was of translucent vitri-
 sheen and the colors softened with
 hues of lavender along the tight waist
 and baggy slacks that clung loosely to
 her slender limbs a single row of
 ruby-red native shells curving little
 things that resembled tjny twisted horns
 adorned the flaring neck piece

   beyond her the interior of the room
 was gloomy with the steel ribs of the
 metal walls barely visible a large
 round window beaded on the outside
 with greenish moisture told of humid
 clouds lying low over the rugged sur-
 face of venus blanketing away the
 suns rays

  the illumination was scant but it
caught at the girls vitrisheen garments
and gave the material a soft luminosity
her features were delicately chiseled
her tiny nose seemed a trifle insolent
above the carmine outline of her im-
petuous mouth sometimes she re-
minded him of a fragile flower bloom-
ing in a sheltered place

  im glad the space cruiser is com-
ing she said with evident relief twist-
ing a silver bracelet on her wrist round
and round you might have been con-
siderate enough of me to have kept the

 sick little troll out of here where theres
 danger of alien infection

  omar klegg avoided her eyes it
was odd thinking of this woman as his
wife the past three months had wit-
nessed a strange drama in this isolated
wind-swept venusian bad-land terri-
tory

  no space cruiser is coming he
stated gruffly you know theres none
due i said weve got to get out

  her eyes widened fastened
to the marks of conflict evident on his
face long red scratches showed there
and the transparent face sheathing was
torn raggedly but the venu-amer-
ico settlement colony is a hundred miles
away and its the nearest

  weve got to go returned omar
bluntly he pushed her aside moving
toward an inner metallic door giving
into a bedroom apartment as he
passed the girls eyes narrowed with
horror as they fastened upon the tiny
lolling head of the venusian native of
the eola territory as the bad lands had
been named-in honor of the terrific
wind that had carved an eroded twisted
surface from the soft stone of the alti-
tude regions

  the greenish waxlike flesh of the
small head was diseased in spots that
were almost transparent slender
pointed ears curled round close to the
bulging pink-glazed eyes that which
made the face more repulsive to her
was the absence of a nose while the
froglike mouth was pendulously under-
shot

  the native no larger than a boy of
twelve lay in omars arms like a limp
sack with dull unseeing eyes staring
fixedly enid drew back trembling

   its oolanth he said shortly and
strode into the gloomy interior hes
dying and with oolanth dead the
prospects of our security arent worth a
settlement coin slug you know how i
came to be tolerated here among these


astounding stories

barbaric little eolians with oolanth
gone theres nothing to hold them
back

  he deposited the native on a couch
and turned in a wall compartment he
found a tiny venus lantern with a wire
handle from his pocket he withdrew
two small crystals each the size of a
pea they might have been crystals of
galena judging from appearance but
when the vapor of the sealed glass tube
struck the crystals they became splin-
ters of cold brilliant light flinging a
glow about the entire room

  the ribbed beryllium walls were ex-
posed nakedly with an oval window at
the rear hung with curtains of silver
cloth those curtains were enids con-
tribution to the homeliness of an in-
terior that presented an aspect of cheer-
lessness and austerity characterized by
the forbidding frigidity of unadorned
metal walls and metal furnishings

  with the terrestrial value on venus
moon crystals so high he had rarely
used them during the ten daylight
hours these luxobe crystals were like
radio-active minerals in a way being
continually dissipated through a radi-
ated flow of energy except that their
rate of demolition as compared with
radium was very rapid

  in a vapor of monoxide these crys-
tals radiated away as rays of sheer
light for a period varying from three
months to a year of terrestrial earth
hours these amazing little crystals
would dwindle away as light and then
they would be gone

  it was for these moon crystals that
omar klegg had come to the cloud
planet these fragmentary minerals
inactive in the ordinary atmosphere of
venus were scattered over the surface
of the planet and it was suspected that
these many particles once composed a
satellite circling the mother planet
hence they had been called moon crys-
tals since the breaking up of such an

astral body could explain their haphaz-
ard scattering about the surface of
venus

  omar kleggs life had been a
solitary one these past few years with
the exception of those recent strange
months since enid had come uninvited
and unheralded to share his primitive
life on a wilderness world

  he had thought of her as a goal
toward which his laboring years were
being expended he had loved her and
had expected her after his term of
service with the earth trading co was
through then when he had returned
to the terrestrial globe with the profits
that would be his due she would have
been a further prize

  he had been shocked when she
dropped from the swinging gangplank
of the space cruiser that came at six-
month intervals to his trading station
bringing supplies and taking on the
cargo of moon crystals which were bar-
tered from the natives

   enid was so delicate so beautiful
she was out of place here in the sav-
age bad lands she had seemed so
childishly happy with this new world
there was nothing else to do the
space commander of the cruiser had
married them and she had come to live
in the trading station on venus then
had begun a period of disillusionment

   yet through his exacting labors and
privations omar had managed to find
comfort and romance in the thought
that here was the source of cold light
for the multitudinous crystal lamps of
earth which had become so popular
of recent years he thought of it as
he traded cheap trinkets and gaudy
ornaments to the barbaric eolanians for
the crystals they found sometimes he
tried to imagine all the crystal lanterns
in the terrestrial cities lighting up the
night periods

  now he watched the twin crystals
roll from his hand through a funnel-

ast-
moon crystals



shaped air-lock contrivance and thence
into the interior of the spherical glass
tube of the lantern to turn whitely
luminous m the inclosed vapor light
for the lamps of earth it had sounded
heroic in those first letters he had writ-
ten to enid when she had been back on
earth it didnt sound heroic now he
hung the lantern  a hook in the low
ceiling and took off his slicker

  enid stood in the doorway staring
at the thing on the couch her breath
was bated and she seemed bewildered
with a growing fear

  why did you bring him here
omar she protested

  hes dying said omar klegg
shortly she came across the room and
caught his arm gripping it hard his
face turned and their eyes met he
read horror dawning in her eyes deep
down like unseen things stirring in the
bottom of a pool her other hand had
caught a loose fold of her waist and
was holding it tremulously across her
smooth throat

  what will the others do she
wanted to know

  the traders cruiser will be here in
three months he said moving so his
face was in the shadow from the crys-
tal lantern but you must not remain

  will they know oh they are bar-
baric they remind me so of demons
and when they look at me my flesh
crawls they seem inhuman 

  they are inhuman enid you
should understand that their composi-
tion is utterly different everythings
different here on venus because
theres no carbon dioxide terrestrial
life wouldnt have developed here its
dependent on herbivorous life and
theres  plant life on venus

  somehow these natives are both ani-
mal and plant without the aid of car-
bon dioxide but just how i dont
know they are all cold and heartless
they are inhuman all except oolanth
and i saved his life once hes got a

 ast-

spark of something in him he thought
i was a god and hes never forgotten
that he fears and respects me as such
-so do the other natives but when
he dies which wont be long they will
know

  theyll know youre just a man
said the woman her fingers working at
his sleeve

  thats why i brought him here
it will give us a start it may be hours
before they discover hes dead and well
be gone they let me bring him here
because they think im something of a
god but even at that i had to fight some
of them back thats why theyve tol-
erated me when no other man ever
could step a safe foot on bad-land soil
of venus

  i saved oolanth once from a sim-
ple fever then again i showed them
how to cap the fumaroles when the gas
vapor began to escape in their god
caves they associate things like that
with the supernatural now oolanth is
sick again and they think i can save
him i cant hes too far gone and
no matter if oolanth looks like a demon
from hell he has befriended me enid
im going to stay with him till he goes

  i should never have come here i
was a romantic little fool youre not
what i thought you would be were
-were just like strangers omar
back on earth you were wonderful to
me i thought we would get along
splendidly

  omar klegg shrugged and snapped
the metal-mesh sleeves tight along his
wrists the fog had dulled the silvery
hue of the metal mesh he wore plain
fiber-woven trousers tucked in celluline
boots that looked like red leather

  we knew each other but two weeks
enid that was my first vacation back
on earth

  she clapped her hands and leaned
against the striated beryllium wall i
thought i could never be happy unless


astounding stories

i were with you and things are so
different here on this tiny satellite
were alone here all we see are our
own faces-and those of the natives
good heaven omar cant you under-
stand 

  omar kleggs face was turning red
he was becoming angry the mouth
of the native was drooling saliva and
the ugly features were writhing with in-
ner pain

  all right enid he said shortly i
understand one thing venus is not for
the fragile ill do my best to get you
to the settlements and ill see you catch
the first interplanetary vessel home
you may go then if you wish but
now please leave me alone and dont
lean so close to oolanth the carbon
dioxide in your breath is poison to
him

  she drew back the cold rays of
the crystal lantern caught ruddy tints
in her soft blond curls her blue eyes
sparkled hotly yet there was an ex-
pression almost of pleading in them he
felt her hand closing over his elbow
she had said he did not understand her
it had never occurred to him that she
was right

  omar did not turn but he felt her
clutch relaxing when he looked
around she was gone and the door was
shut oolanth was very weak his
slender arms moved jerkily and the
loose folds of skin that stretched be-
tween the bony limbs dragged convul-
sively about

  the unsightly little native would not
have weighed more than twenty pounds
when those powerful hind legs thrust
at the surface ground and the folds
of loose skin were flattened and taut
these natives could launch themselves
into the air like gliders sometimes
they reminded him of flying squirrels
of the terrestrial globe it made him
homesick for the comparative security
of earth

  he wasnt thinking much of danger

oolanth had been a real friend despite
his demoniac appearance he had
saved the little green mans life and
from that time on omar klegg had
been the one white man who could step
foot on the bad-land soil of venus with-
out the aid of blazing needle-beam gats

  it hadnt been easy for oolanth to
prove his friendship the natives hated
the strange white men from whose
breath came the poisonous fumes of
carbon dioxide

  omar klegg was the only white man
who had ever witnessed the mysteries
of the god caves and that was only be-
cause oolanth considered him as a sort
of godlike being if there were any
mutterings in the savage horde at ex-
posing their religious secrets to the
white conjurer oolanth quelled them
omar was a god to him who had swept
aside the forces of the universe and
spared his life he would do so again

  early that day he had sent the green
venus pixies for ociar oolanth lay
dying in the god caves and all the sav-
age deities called from the clouds and
the wind could not halt the lowering
ebb of life and omar had brought
him here

  oolanth was very rigid the saliva
had dried on his mouth and it hung
open the reddish eyes had set he
was dead omar arose pulled the cur-
tains across the oval window and took
the crystal lantern from its hook

 he shut the door carefully
and locked it turning around his eyes
sought for enid but the room was
empty except for the metallic couches
and chairs with vitrisheen cushions a
picture of earth hung slackly on the
wall above a bottle containing many
colored pebbles native to venus

  the front door was ajar showing a
strip of the foggy out-of-doors he
looked for her cloak sometimes she
went out upon the alcove where a tiny
balcony overlooked the rugged valley


moon crystals



when her spirits were restless to be
near the inscrutable rush of elements

  he must warn her placing the crys-
tal lantern on a table he pushed past
the door into the murky twilight in
his right hand he held a needle-beam
gat drawn from a holster at his belt
there was no use to take chances

  enid he shouted  enid he
was not soon to forget the look of ter-
ror upon her drawn features as she
turned leaning on the balustrade and
looked back at him beyond a stretch
of rocky soil was exposed to view be-
neath low-lying clouds and many di-
minutive figures were creeping forward
making scarcely a sound in the claw-

troll-like green men who advanced
threateningly up the pathway

  enid he shouted and seized her
arm dont be a fool he wrenched
the gun from her hand and turned her
about now do what i tell you you
mustnt let them know you are afraid
do you understand you must be con-
temptuous of them dont show your
fear they sense that at once and it
makes them run amuck

  she lay in his arms limp to her
it was a horrid dream omar had
thrust his face close to her own and
she leaned against him moveless until
he turned toward the oncoming natives
leaving her against the balustrade

like hands were grasped knives and im-
plements of stone their eyes were
fixed upon the human beings who
peered forth

  its too late omar she said

 he shook his head how could
they have known he ejaculated
sometimes i think they have instincts
we cant understand

  then oolanth is dead asked enid
clutching at her breast the atmos-
phere gave her features a greenish
tinge when he nodded she wheeled
in her hand was a small needle-beam
gun and it was pointed toward the

  he had said she must not fear them
he did not seem afraid standing there
one arm upthrust he shouted there
came a deep growling from many cav-
ernous lips again omar cried aloud
in a peremptory challenge

  enid saw that the natives had halted
but they were conversing among them-
selves with evident discontent occa-
sionally a low cloud swirler drifted by
clogging the vicious little faces but
their hoarse voices were not so easily
subdued

  when omar shouted in a question-
ing tongue many voices answered in


astounding stories

the garbled dialect of the natives he
stood talking to them for a moment
then turned to her

  this is worse than i thought
they know hes dead all right but
i think i can get us through safely if
you do as i tell you dont act afraid
of them stick your chin up and dont
even look at them ill do the watch-
ing out for trouble

  they want us to go to the god
caves its too late to go for the set-
tlements now theyd know we wrere
afraid and be on our heels but ive
got an ace in the hole theyre not count-
ing on you must do as i say

  she was deathly afraid the green
little dwarfs had always sickened her
but she nodded and omar turned to
the door

  stay there he commanded look
disdainful-and dont move ill be
back in just a second

  he was gone before she could stop
him and her heart was pounding vio-
lently while her breath came with agon-
izing slowness it took every bit of
her will power to stand there she
gazed up at the overcast skies to keep
from fainting at the sickness that
gnawed at her omar knew she was
afraid yet he had demanded that she
stay there it was cruel of him yet
she was determined not to falter then
he was back carrying two slicker gar-
ments with transparent face sheathings

  she realized of a sudden that her
face was wet with moisture that her
clothing was damp it was hard to
keep from falling her muscles seemed
not to respond naturally but she averted
her face and struggled into the garment
drawing the transparent sheathing up
and around her face

  then omar was descending the steps
and she found herself walking behind
like an automaton those ferocious lit-
tle faces stood out in the fog like spec-

ters in a dream and then a way was
opened for them

  omar said nothing but strode close
to enids side and a little ahead the
mad vista was branded indelibly upon
her consciousness the fog dipped and
eddied she could sense the closely
packed bodies of the eolanians stand-
ing to either side with barbaric weap-
ons clenched in their small hands

  the fog had choked the outlines of
the metal building now and the natives
walked along beside the two terrestrials
growling to themselves abruptly a
commotion in the rear caused some of
the foremost to look back enid turned
and stared for a moment she saw a
group of the natives bearing a rigid fig-
ure over their heads in the gloom
they looked like shadows it was ool-
anth stiff and horrid in death whom
they bore aloft she told omar what
she had seen

  they got him then said omar
its just as well

  the valley floor widened and ab-
ruptly they were in the eolanian vil-
lage with the globular structures of
mud and rock plastered against precipi-
tous obstructions like wasp nests
smaller natives joined the procession
bearing curiously shaped rocks of all
colors enid presumed these smaller
green people to be women and children

  she saw a creature about the size of
a dog looking something like a wasp
without wings it was the only do-
mestic animal known to the green men
and like them it was of alien constitu-
tion independent of herbivorous plants
when it started toward them omar
kicked at it and it fled with a slobber-
ing sound

 a maniacal frenzy seemed
born within the natives their feet
stamped the rocky floor of the canyon
in a wild cadence their pinkish eyes
protruded and the great bloated lips
opened widely to emit chortling screams
moon crystals



the procession had halted before a high
cliff of black rock from which yawned
a steep triangular opening

   its the entrance to the god caves
said omar dont be frightened by
the clamor theyre propitiating their
gods

  they are motioning for us to stop
keep going he demanded curtly
were not going to recognize their dei-
ties beyond the three-cornered open-
ing a faint luminosity was revealed as
they went on into the cave a vague
and ominous growling rippled over the
grouped natives some of them leaped
and cavorted making demoniac and
obscene gestures when the funeral
cortege for oolanth passed solemnly
after the terrestrials those behind made
a mad rush for other cave entrances
that would converge on the god caves
how are you feeling enid

  i-i want to cry

  hold together it may be worse
than this when we get to the god
caves give particular notice to the
domed structures on the cavern floor
i told you that i showed oolanth how
to cap the fumaroles in the floor of the
god caves that is what those struc-
tures will be

  the rugged walls of the cavern
glowed phosphorescently lighting the
limited confines behind the trampling
of many feet appraised them of ool-
anths funeral procession close upon
their heels the corridor was worn
bare by the passage of many feet it
turned twice then gave into a large
circular cavern with a massive altar of
red glassy rock at the farther side
above which was a monstrous idol
carved into the phosphorescent rock

  the head of the idol was huge and
distorted it looked something like a
monstrous squatted toad branching
from the central cavern were many
openings and runways from which the
natives streamed gesticulating and
shouting

  omar pointed to the low heaps of
domed stone scarcely a foot high plas-
tered over with thick cement enid
stumbled over one of them the rum-
bling of many hoarse voices filled the
cavern

  all around them were grimacing
faces the little green men shouted
and spat at the terrestrials brandishing
their weapons only the way before
them was left open and that led up to
the altar composed of a substance like
red glass

  but they were carried past this also
by the surge of natives behind them
a second doorway yawned in the cliff
beyond the idol they were pressed
into the opening omar frowned he
had never been in this inner cavern
enid was sobbing despite her efforts
to quiet her emotions and she clung
unashamedly to his arm a glitter of
silvery metal in one wall captured his
attention

  he stared although he had no
time to stop and examine the formation
it was almost solid with luxobe the
moon crystals of venus a massive
meteorite of the substance must have
been imbedded here perhaps it was
the core of the satellite that had crum-
bled and fallen from its orbit so it
was here that the natives got their moon
crystals he had supposed that they
found them on the rocky surface of the
bad lands somewhere

  abruptly omar knew that the eolani-
ans never intended that they return to
tell of this large deposit of moon crys-
tals he gripped at the needle-beam
gat hanging in its holster the shouts
of the green men reverberated deafen-
ingly now a second and even larger
cavern loomed ahead

  they strode down into the bowl-
shaped cavity side by side followed by
the thronged green natives of venus
omar could have shouted aloud for
joy he took a quick look around be-


astounding stories

fore the natives crowded in the fuma-
roles had evidently broken loose in this
cavern also for he saw signs of native
work capping the gaseous outlets with
concrete domes he looked farther
along the walls

  hung around against the walls were
many whitened skeletons one of which
was large and unlike the others so
one other earth man had got here but
he had died it was a chamber of the
dead

  oolanths body was placed face up
in the center a group of natives
formed a ring and danced about him
making superstitious gestures and bel-
lowing in strident tones then all of
them knelt and one arose over him
and lifted his head high to scream a
hideous challenge

  oolanths soul had gone to the great
darkness

  enid could scarcely believe her senses
omar had arisen to face the little green
man and he too lifted his face and
suddenly screamed aloud in an answer-
ing challenge that rung to the phophor-
escent roof and rebounded again with
eerie echoings omar klegg knew that
the affront made by the little green man
had been aimed at the terrestrials the
native had proclaimed that the earth
beings were not gods and omar had
hurled the defiant words back into the
others face as a lie

  a hemispherical sea of faces hemmed
them in the green man came forward
threateningly preparing to throw a
sharp stone fragment equipped with
filed spikes omar leveled the needle-
beam gat when the eolanian sprang
a blue beam of intense light cut his
body in half omar turned as his ad-
versary sank to the floor and again
screamed a warning in the native
tongue

  his face was almost bestial enid
cringed it was hard to believe that
omar was a terrestrial and her man
she looked about into the ring of green-

ish faces and knew suddenly that these
creatures were as a pack of hungry
wolves without mercy another green
man leaped over the body of oolanth
and again the needle beam spat its ray
of death

  simultaneously the entire horde be-
gan edging in

  be ready to run for it shouted
omar

  then he turned and shot the blu-
ish needle beam down along the cavern
floor the slender ray bored into a
dome shape plastered into the rock
floor for a moment it ate into the
stonework then something erupted
a shrill whistle of escaping vapor fol-
lowed a spray of rock upward before
the astonished natives could attack a
mouth from the deep interior of venus
spat up and the expanding gas cre-
ated a column of ice that reared up like
a cold flame

  back cried omar grasping enid
by the arm its carbon dioxide-pure
carbon dioxide and its been under a
pressure

  enid seemed paralyzed she had
seen ice formed by the release of car-
bon dioxide under pressure in liquid
oxygen experiments heat was ab-
sorbed from the air and the pure oxy-
gen became a cold liquid she saw it
an icy silvery stream trickling away
from the mounting column of ice to
run across the face of the dead oolanth

  the blue disintegrator beam traveled
farther along the cavern floor cutting
crazy furrows to other mouths of ce-
ment which shrieked with escaping
gases and spouted up other tongues of
frigid ice the natives were bent over
writhing and screaming the carbon
dioxide was a poison that acted rapidly
for them their muscles became twisted
and hardened and they fell back before
the hissing gases as wheat falls before
the cutter

  the terrestrial lungs were accustomed
i

moon crystals

to carbon dioxide but not to the frost-
ing air enid scarcely remembered the
mad dash back along the cavern way
they encountered no resistance leav-
ing behind them columns of dry ice
reaching up toward the ceiling and a
shambles-

  even those green men yet loitering
outside were so terrified that they flung
themselves upon their faces as the ter-
restrials passed

  well have no more trouble from
them said omar as they stumbled
through the doorway into the familiar
quarters of the trading company build-
ing ive seen fumaroles on earth
that vented pure carbon dioxide but i
dont know what chemical change
started these gaseous outlets in venus
where the gas lias heretofore been un-
known it was lucky i showed the na-
tives how to cap them off now we
can make that hundred-mile trek in per-
fect safety to the venu-americo settle-
ment

  enid said nothing she lay for an
hour upon a couch regaining her
strength and calming her nerves when
she awoke omar was sitting in a chair
smoking a cigarette with his eyes in
the distance a crystal lantern hung
over him and from time to time his
eyes roamed to the tiny crystals in the
glass tube radiant with unwavering
light

  she lay for a long time watching
him through narrowed eyelids then
she yawned stretched her sore linibs
and arose her ankles and knees
twinged excruciatingly



  you awake enid he asked i
guess its been like a bad dream
youll be glad to know we can start
for the settlements -in the morning
she walked unsteadily toward him
this means a lot to you doesnt it
she asked wonderingly i mean this
planet this life trading to the natives

i suppose they might establish a mining
colony here with you to direct the men
in removing the meteor

  omar avoided her eyes

  i dont know he said maybe i
havent decided yet ill decide that
after youre gone

  but im not going

  enid

  no im not

  her eyes were moist i couldnt
understand how much it meant to you
she said but when we were in the
caves i knew it was you that i cared
for and i understood a part of how
you must feel oh omar dont you
want me do you think-im too-
fragile

  she was as light as a feather in his
arms he kissed her over and over
again fragile he said youre not
fragile i was talking about inner
strength when i said venus was not for
the fragile i had you wrong enid i
knew that back there in the caves
she began to cry and he sat back
with her in his lap to stare at the crys-
tal lantern with its unwinking minerals
glowing softly in the glassen tube cra-
dle light for the lamps of earth at
last he had found some one who could
share his dream

        a story of science which runs
        away with the world-for a time

by nat schachner

the long bleak room was hushed
with strain the gray morn-
ing light filtered wanly through
the high barred windows and tinged
with vague unreality the strange appa-
ratus that crowded the floor

  kenneth craig shivered a bit as he
stared through the grimy glass at the
huge somber walls that inclosed the
prison in unbreakable embrace he
was hardly conscious that his eyes care-
fully avoided the complication of equip-
ment that he had helped to devise and
construct he knew however that he
dared not meet the gaze of the three
men who shared with him the immen-
sity of the dingy interior surely the
emotion that suffocated him and caused
his heart to pound with great hammer
blows was visible on his countenance
for all to see

  somewhere a bell boomed faintly
beating out the hour with sullen strokes
craig ticked them off shudderingly
one-two-three-four-five-six  a
silence fell upon the men in the room
some one cleared his throat nervously
a sound arose faint far-off at first
then swelling into a muffled clamor of
many voices howling shrieking in sub-
human accents of despair and bitter-
ness

  kenneth craig knew what it was
without being told the vast susurrous
that exhaled from hundreds of gray-
faced convicts each immured in his own
cubicle of teel when one of their own
commenced the slow death march to
the execution chamber

  execution chamber ken stiffened
shuddered again a wave of revulsion
swept over him it was a monstrous
thing they were about to attempt it was
worse a man had a right to die in
peace even if he were what this man
was claimed to be he had a right
not to be subjected to an experiment
that would burst the bonds which na-
ture had immutably decreed and pro-
duce-what 

  for the moment ken was no longer
the eager brilliant scientist who had
worked under and with malcolm stubbs
world-famous physical chemist and bi-
ologist he was just a very human
young man who shrank from the moral
consequences of the next few hours
animals yes the results had been
dazzlingly successful that was why the
governor had granted this particular
unprecedented thing but a human be-
ing  who knew what the incalculable
consequences might be who knew-

  stubbs was an imposing figure tall
angular face carved into bleak un-
compromising lines a harsh taskmas-
ter who drove himself as mercilessly as
he drove others a man whose fanatical
devotion to science had withered every
human emotion every human attribute
the past year had not been cxactly a
bed of roses ken thought wryly though
there were hundreds of others who
would gladly have given their right
arms to step into his place

  stubbs stood close to the huge
quartzite tank that ran like an oblong
transparent coffin down the middle of
for one long minute stubbs the recessive stared with hate-filled
triumphant gaze into the paralyzed eyes of stubbs the dominant


astounding stories

the room coffin ken grinned wanly
to himself even his smiles were get-
ting macabre

  the prison warden shuffled his feet
with a scraping sound it was he who
had coughed nervously he was a
thickset man of middle age and he had
been in charge of the state penitentiary
for almost a decade he had super-
vised and been present at a hundred
executions during that period

  surely ken thought he should be
immune to any qualms over what was
about to take place but he was obvi-
ously not his fingers clutched con-
vulsively at the keys that dangled from
his belt and his free hand mopped con-
tinually with a large damp handker-
chief at his baldish head his eyes
jerked like marionettes on a string from
the forty-foot tank with the profusion
of apparatus in back of it to the nar-
row gray door

  the fourth man was the most placid
of them all he leaned easily against
the wall chewing with calm deliberation
on an unlighted cigar he was the
prison doctor short and somewhat
dumpy with pink smooth cheeks and
a correct impersonal manner

  the muted howling from outside died
away as suddenly as it had arisen as
if the inmates knew that it was all
over that the thing was done irrev-
ocably ken felt the palms of his hands
go dry and hot if only they were
right if only it were over but they
were mistaken the electrocution cham-
ber was only a few steps from con-
demned row the current should al-
ready have surged through the body of
the man whose life had been declared
forfeit by the state this place which
they had transformed into a laboratory
was at the farther end of the prison
yard and it took time for the slow
measured march

  no one but the four of them wait-
ing in hushed rigidity- and the governor
knew what was about to be done not

the prison guards not the inmates not
a single solitary person in the outside
world not the condemned criminal him-
self

  if this should leak out the gov-
ernor had remarked grimly when he
signed the necessary documents in au-
thorization it would be as much as my
political head is worth

  he had been mighty reluctant the
governor had and only the ruthless
pressure stubbs had brought to bear
and a certain awe which he had for
science in the abstract load turned the
trick

  for over a month stubbs and his
young assistant had worked in feverish
secrecy at dead of night setting up
their equipment in this abandoned work-
shop the governor had insisted that
the experiment take place within the
prison walls where if necessary the
results could be quietly hushed up an
order had been issued the night before
routine officially terse barring report-
ers and spectators from the impending
execution of james horty bank robber
and murderer extraordinary

 the door swung open ken
whirled his nerves were jangled
warden parker dropped his heavy keys
with a crash his hand trembled as he
stooped to pick them up even dr
bascom stiffened from his slouch but
stubbs to whom this meant the consum-
mation of years of irfsane driving toil
did not move

  two men in the blue of prison guards
came into the room between them
manacled to their wrists was a third
his face was as gray as the loose ill-
fitting costume he wore his brutish
deep-set eyes disclosed the terror that
seeped from within yet his head was
flung back a sneer of attempted bra-
vado writhed at his lips he owed it
to the curious spectators to the report-
ers to his fellows out there in the world
of sky and city streets and smoke-thick

hide-aways to put up a good show
jim horty dead game to the last
the words danced before him and
braced limbs that unaccountably wanted
to sag beneath him

  his pig eyes darted around the room
the hot spot where was it  hed
spit contemptuously in its direction
that would be a new gag would rate
columns in the papers all through the
long dreary hours in condemned row
he had thought of that last supreme
gesture

  the steel links clashed indistinctly
on his wrists there was a dull roar-
ing in his ears where was he this
was not the execution chamber that
big tank filled with stuff that looked
like jelly all that funny-looking ma-
chinery around the room-what did it
all mean

  for a moment a wild hope surged
through his heavy apelike frame any
change from the sinister routine meant
only one thing the governor had re-
prieved him pie would live-live

  sure there was the warden the
louse and the doctor old crab-face
didnt look any too good-like he was
scared of something of what horty
looked wildly around again even as the
door shut behind him with irrevocable
clamor and steel locks tumbled into
place

  he began to sweat it was a crummy
sort of place the execution room he
could stand-he had hopped himself up
for that but all this-it gave a guy
the shivers crab-face scared doc
looking through him as though he
wasnt there and those other two fel-
lows never saw them before one
bird just a youngster looked white
around the gills and there was pity in
his eyes pity for jim horty
there wasnt any reprieve then but
what-

  his limbs trembled under him he
would have fallen if the guards had not
held him up

  what you gonna do with me
warden  he croaked hoarsely

  warden parker shook his head he
did not like this himself it was out
of his line horty was entitled to a
nice clean shot of juice just like the
others a couple of minutes and it
would be over everything regular and
the normal routine of the prison would
flow on but this well orders were
orders

  sorry horty he said almost
kindly youre not in my hands any
more mr stubbs has complete charge
here

  stubbs nodded to horty his tall
angular frame seemed to grow and dis-
tort and his eyes glittered with strange
lights thats right horty and you
ought to be mighty thankful too you
are about to become the subject of an
experiment that will change the course
of the human race produce results in-
calculable in their consequence in-
stead of dying ignominiously in the elec-
tric chair to you has been granted the
supreme honor of becoming the first
of the new men

  what was the old geezer talking
about experiment first of the new
men no electric chair the warden
looked more scared than before and

that young fellow-

  a blinding light seared through
hortys brain brought understanding
they were going to cut him up see how
his insides worked like they did in
hospitals to dogs and rabbits vivisec-
tion  thats what they wanted to do
to him he threw himself suddenly
forward against his manacles so sud-
denly that he almost dragged the guards
off their feet

  i aint gonna let him cut me up
he screamed i got rights the judge
told me id get the electric chair im
entitled to it nobody can take it away
from me warden parker dont let
him cut me up

  he was pleading now sobbing all


astounding stories

his bravado forgotten pleading for
death for anything but that tank and
that machinery and that old fellow they
called stubbs with the eyes that burned
right through him

  its the governors orders parker
answered helplessly

  the scientist took a step forward
you fool he exploded im giv-
ing you a chance at a new life at a
life far beyond your stupid compre-
hension

  i dont want it the criminal
screamed i want to die like they
told me get me my mouthpiece hell
help-

  all right men stubbs nodded
coldly to the guards there was no
use in arguing further with the idiot
the experiment must go on according
to schedule

  they handled the shrieking strug-
gling criminal expertly impersonally
it was all in the days work they un-
locked the handcuffs threw him down
on a pallet stripped him of every shred
of clothing then oblivious to his
shrieks and obscene cursing they held
him tight while stubbs injected a hypo-
dermic into his arm

  the shrieks grew fainter thicker
then they died away in a long shudder
james horty lay stiff unmoving un-
knowing

 ken craig was already at the
huge quartzite tank now that the
crucial experiment was already under
way he became once more the sci-
entist human emotions dropped from
him like a cloak every step of the
procedure had been rehearsed a dozen
times had been practiced with animals
on a smaller scale time and again most
of the technique as a matter of fact
was his stubbs was not good at that

  the great tank was forty feet long
ten feet wide and five deep it was

filled almost to the top with a clear
lusterless jelly huge electrodes sank
deep into the thin quivering stuff at
either end and were connected by cables
with an instrument board on the wall

  ken pressed a button a section of
the glass top slid smoothly underneath
leaving the tank exposed just wide
enough to admit a human body above
it suspended from a miniature crane
was a cradle of extremely thin longi-
tudinally stretched wires at a gesture
from ken the guards lifted the im-
mobile body of the condemned man
deposited it carefully into the cradle

  then he knifed a switch there was
a whir and the cradle with its strange
burden dipped slowly from unwinding
chains into the transparent substance
within the tank down down ever
down while the men in the room stared
with fixed unwilling fascination dr
bascom forgot his pose of smooth bore-
dom leaned eagerly forward the
guards gaped blankly

  ken was tremendously cool now all
his faculties concentrated on the work
in hand the jelly closed with a
quiver over the descending form
within its clear depths the cradled body
showed like a prehistoric monster
caught in a huge globule of ancient am-
ber

  there was a tiny bump the cradle
had come to rest on the floor of the
tank close to the positive electrode
ken pressed another button the wires
opened out underneath the rigid body
and the apparatus rose to its former
position again the glass section slid
smoothly into place the tiny click
as it closed was loud

  the warden shivered looked around
professional routine jerked him out of
his haze it would never do for the
guards to witness what was going on
they might talk

  o k you two he said harshly
get back to your duties the men
muttered something went out hur-
the isotope men



riedly as if they were glad to be done
even the tainted air of the prison cor-
ridors outside seemed sweet after what
little they had seen in the converted
workshop

  stubbs moved quickly to the instru-
ment panel for an instant his long
bony fingers clung with fierce grip to
the bakelite handle of the master switch
his eyes burned through the transpar-
ency of the tank fixed with a fanatical
light on the quiescent body within

  the future of the world rested on
the tug of his hand if the experi-
ment proved a success his name would
go rocketing down the centuries
darwin newton einstein galileo
would be pale glimmering phantoms
compared to him yet he hesitated
things his young assistant ken craig
had said flashed through his mind the
youngster had pleaded with him not to
go through with this final test had
been damned persistent about it

  he malcolm stubbs had finally for-
bidden further discussion the young
whippersnapper with his silly talk of
outraged nature of incalculable results
what of them science was its own
justification nothing else mattered
suppose what craig had said were true
for an infinitesimal second a vague
doubt disturbed his fanatic unity of pur-
pose-then he was himself again the
switch knifed down

  a tremendous current surged
through the electrodes the jelly at
their base stirred uneasily blurred
slightly with tiny bubbles the seem-
ingly dead figure of horty hazed at the
edges

  the great experiment had begun
the experiment that would change the
face of the world that would bring to
pass disruptions and transformations
beyond anything even ken in his
vaguest and most inchoate fears had
ever dreamed possible could the four
men in that laboratory have peered into

the future- but that was impos-
sible inconceivable and wiser per-
haps if the human race could visual-
ize perfectly the consequences of its
acts nothing would ever be done ever
accomplished mankind would die of
dry rot and cowardly inanition

  ken looked at his wrist watch six
ten he reported at seven fourteen
the reaction should be complete

  a choking gasp came from the
warden terror leaped into his eyes
as he pointed with trembling finger to-
ward the innermost recesses of the
tank my lord look he almost
screamed look at horty i

  ken had never taken his eyes away
the prison doctors face was a mask of
wonderment stubbs permitted himself
a bleak frozen smile the experiment
was proceeding according to schedule

  the body of the immersed criminal
seemed to have widened out not
bloated in the way a dead thing swells
when putrefaction sets in but stretch-
ing in a flat horizontal plane along the
jellied floor of the tank

  the features were still there the
outlines of his nude form were still
recognizable but they were curiously
vague curiously misty as they groped
away from the positive electrode seem-
ingly urged by some irresistible force
in the direction of the negative cylin-
der

  ken was suddenly weak inside he
could understand exactly how the
warden felt he had seen this happen
many times with small animals but a
human being even a murderer was
somehow different

  stubbs eyes snapped angrily he
did not like any display of human emo-
tion during the course of an experi-
ment it complicated things unneces-
sarily and introduced an incalculable
element which found no place in his
scientific equations the emotions alto-
gether were signs of weakness of
addle-pated thinking


astounding stories

  there is no need for expletives or
dramatics mr warden he observed
with glacial frigidity i must insist
upon a proper decorum from the spec-
tators

  but parker was beyond hearing the
intended rebuke his eyes were bulg-
ing on the tank the jelly was quiver-
ing with strange forces invisible
strains emanated from the positive elec-
trode heaved the transparent substance
in long internally contained billows
down the length of the tank the proc-
ess was accelerating

  jim horty was no longer a solid
compact body he had lost shape and
substance he was stretching out along
the plane of vibration in a tenuous
ghostlike flow he was blurred and
misty and unrecognizable he was a
parallelepiped of former length and
thickness but already he was three feet
wide and expanding visibly then as
parker uttered a choked cry something
happened

  the misty tenuous form seemed to
divide along the longitudinal axis of his
body something like a cell reproducing
by binary fission to the extreme right
and left dense formless masses made
dark blotches within the jelly in be-
tween shading into the two heavier sec-
tions was a thinner more rarefied sub-
stance through whose interstices the
vague adumbrating outlines of the tank
behind were dimly visible

  parkers face was gray and twitch-
ing stark horror swept over him in a
blanketing cloud he could stand it no
longer this thing that he was witness-
ing with a shrill cry he wheeled ran
blindly toward the steel door fumbled
with palsied fingers at the bolts and
was out for the first time in his life
the warden had known fear for the
first time in his life he had violated the
simple terms of his duty he had
quitted the side of a condemned crim-
inal had abandoned him to the hands
of men not connected with the prison

  it was not until he reached the pri-
vacy of his own office and dropped
trembling into a chair that he thought
of that but horty was no longer alive
he argued with himself it was incon-
ceivable ghastly what he had just seen
not for a million dollars would he ven-
ture back into that place of horror
let those inhuman scientists do what
they wished as long as he did not see

  back in the converted laboratory
stubbs was faintly amused a sardonic
smile twisted his thin lips were bet-
ter off without him he remarked to
dr bascom you dont feel the same
way about an epochal experiment in sci-
ence do you

  the prison doctor hastily stuffed into
his pocket the large handkerchief with
which he had been mopping his too-pink
face

  no no of course not he replied
hastily i wouldnt miss this for
worlds yet ken was sure that only
professional pride kept him from fol-
lowing in the footsteps of the warden

  ken forced his eyes away from the
tank everything was proceeding ac-
cording to schedule there was noth-
ing else to be done now but wait and
it was not a pleasant sight to watch
silence however would be insupport-
able

  i think dr bascom would be in-
terested in knowing exactly what we are
doing he told stubbs

  the doctor glanced toward the tank
looked hurriedly away again perhaps
if he could focus his mind on cold sci-
entific abstractions the queazy feeling
might pass away

  id be honored he replied eagerly
i have only the vaguest ideas as to-
that his short pudgy arm extended
in the direction of the tank

  stubbs frowned what did craig
mean by his fool suggestion he knew
how he stubbs hated explanations es-
pecially to a layman a doctor bah
the isotope men



worse than a layman his mind would
be cluttered with a horde of outworn
ideas of old wives superstitions mas-
querading in the guise of science
nevertheless he was an audience and
the experiment was going smoothly and
stubbs was still human enough to be
vain of his accomplishment so he un-
bended slightly and condescended to
the doctor

  a good many years ago he began
rather ungraciously i had a brother
when the war came he was idiot
enough to leave my laboratory to throw
himself into the trenches when it was
all over he came back but the war
had done things to him your fellow
medico diagnosed it as shellshock that
no doubt was the inducing mechanism
but the result was definitely what hap-
pens in a very inconsiderable number
of cases

   my brother was no longer himself
he was two other and distinct personal-
ities he remembered nothing of his
past life nothing of myself his family
or friends the two states were sepa-
rate and s liar ply defined he would
alternate suddenly from one to the
other and in each state he would be
wholly unaware of his other incarna-
tion so to speak

  dr bascom nodded his head vigor-
ously he was interested now this
was something in his own field a
clear case of dissociation of personal-
ity he remarked or what is some-
times called dual personality janet has
listed any number of cases in his major
symptoms of hysteria and morton
prince made a very careful painstak-
ing study of a single instance in his
dissociation of a personality 

   stubbs said scornfully ive read
them just as ive read every one else
who pottered around on the subject all
they do is describe the effects the end
results but not one of them went be-
hind the effect to determine the cause
the reason

   i dont think thats quite fair bas-
com objected there have been any
number of theories freud jung and
adler claim that it is the unconscious
coming to the fore and masking the
conscious personality there are others

who-

  bah stubbs snorted i am a
scientist not a dreamer a hider behind
words the unconscious a word to
becloud the issue what scientifically
does it mean

  well-

  precisely stubbs interrupted
nothing at all i delved deeper seek-
ing the true inner mechanism of the
change no wonder the medicos psy-
chologists what not were at a loss the
real explanation was out of their field
completely it was in mine the field
of physical chemistry it was left for
me malcolm stubbs he continued tri-
umphantly to discover that mecha-
nism

  dr bascom gasped he knew quite
as well as stubbs that the pretended ex-
planation of dual or multiple personal-
ities does not explain if what this
tall angular scientist was saying was
true then the whole field of psychology
of neural medicine would be changed
but how he asked

  stubbs ignored him completely he
was just an audience nothing more
did you ever hear of isotopes he
demanded

   yes the doctor admitted cautiously
but i have only a vague idea of what
theyre all about

   so do most people the scientists re-
torted up to quite recently it was
thought that the so-called elements like
hydrogen oxygen and lead were really
simple elements that they could not
be broken down any farther except of
course into electrons protons etc but
a good many workers were suspicious
about the fractional masses of the sup-
posedly simple elements according to
the periodic law according to the elec-


astounding stories

tron theory these masses should have
been whole numbers

  then came startling discoveries in
which i did my share these so-called
simple elements were not simple at all
they were mixtures of two or more
true elements lying close together on
the atomic scale and so nearly identical
in their physical and chemical proper-
ties as to be very difficult to separate
and each one had a whole number as its
atomic weight thus oxygen in real-
ity consists of three isotopes with
weights of sixteen seventeen and
eighteen respectively carbon has two
nitrogen two sulphur three and hydro-
gen had its isotope also-deuterium

  the doctor smiled ive heard of
that all right he said even the
newspapers give space to heavy water

  inwardly however he was wonder-
ing what the devil all this had to do with
the unspeakable thing that was happen-
ing in the tank out of the corner of
his eye he caught a glimpse that made
him avert his gaze quickly and changed
the smile on his face into a forced
sickly grin

  there was no evidence of the man
they had called james horty any more
he had been swallowed up ingested
seemingly into the horrible plasma that
filled the quartzite interior that was
quivering now and bubbling in a veri-
table witches broth faintly halfway
down the tank was an amorphous cloud
without shape without outline yet
bascom had the sickening sensation that
somehow somewhere within that slowly
progressing mass the material thing
that had been horty resided

iii

 the dense phantom trailed
back through the jelly in a slowly thin-
ning smoke until only the straining eye
could discern its presence then it
thickened again still more slowly un-
til some five feet from the positive elec-

trode it coalesced into a thinner rarer
smaller simulacrum of the more rap-
idly moving mass there was that
within its formless vagueness which ap-
palled the doctor more even than the
farther one

  yes ive heard of that he re-
peated dully he must say something
anything to rid him of that last glimpse

  it struck me suddenly stubbs went
on incisively that in the isotopic ele-
ments lay possibly the answer to the
problem of my brother of all similar
cases of dissociation of personality
even perhaps to the unconscious that
the psychoanalysts talk about so glibly

  i dont see how bascom said
plainly bewildered

  it is really quite simple the scien-
tist explained patiently the human
body protoplasm bone structure and
all is composed chiefly of six elements
carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen
sulphur and calcium with a scattering
of others every one of these has been
dissociated into its isotopes they ex-
ist as far as we know in indisseverable
mixture but suppose that isnt so
suppose that some internal mechanism
exists in the human body in each cell
which under certain rare conditions
clicks and dissociates the isotopes we
already know much about the genes of
inheritance within the cell nucleus we
know that there are present side by
side genes of opposing inherited char-
acters the stronger or dominant gene
will mask the recessive characters as
if they did not exist yet in the next
generation perhaps the recessive gene
by proper association may in turn mask
the dominant characteristic

  dr bascom was listening intently
now ken craig had heard this ex-
position before as a matter of fact it
was he who had suggested the analogy
to stubbs had finally put him on the
right trail naturally it was too much
for an assistant to expect credit

  why then i thought stubbs went

ast-
the isotope men



    might not the isotopes of the ele-
ments in the human body act the same
way those present in the largest
quantity would be dominant the others
recessive less than one per cent are
the isotopes the other ninety-nine per
cent what we had heretofore consid-
ered the entire element suppose as
in the case of recessive genes some-
thing happens and the minority isotopes
suddenly mask the dominant norm
what would you have

  the doctors eyes bulged why 
-id say youd have a different per-
sonality the other part of what weve
called dual personalities

  exactly stubbs declared trium-
phantly

  for a while there was silence bas-
com dared not look at the tank he
was afraid it was hard to digest what
he had just heard then diffidently
he ventured the theory sounds im-
peccable but-

  how put it into practice stubbs
finished for him easiest thing in the
world the technique for separating
isotopes is pretty well established by
now ive improved on it immensely
ive done more than merely shift iso-
topes within the body im able to
separate them entirely make two sepa-
rate human bodies two separate entities
where one existed before each com-
posed of a unit set of isotopes ive
done what nature has merely fumbled
at doing ive taken the two personal-
ities and clothed them in visible form
for the first time in the history of the
universe

  bascom gasped so that was
what was taking place within the tank
he shrank away from its implications
even as ken had done a while before
but stubbs thought his gasp was one
of awe for his genius

  in that tank pursued the scientist
is a nutrient gelatin properly treated
to carry an electric current the in-
ast-

jection i gave horty contained beside
a powerful narcotic a saline solution
to promote conductivity within his body
i am passing a current of extremely
high amperage and low voltage through
the gelatin the body dissociates into
ions and following the laws of elec-
trolytic separation these ions migrate
through the gelatin very slowly from
the positive to the negative electrode
but the speed of migration is not the
same for the various isotopes of the
same element the lighter isotope ions
move faster than the heavier ones and
the lighter ones are invariably those ele-
ments which make up ninety-nine per
cent of the whole

  in other words the heavy dominant
personality will reach the negative elec-
trode first the lighter recessive per-
sonality will lag behind

  but theyll both be mere dead ag-
gregations of atoms bascom protested
youve murdered a man

  stubbs smiled bleakly his lips
parted as if to speak when ken stand-
ing at the controls of the tank absorbed
in the drama within shouted excitedly
i think weve reached peak load
chief

  stubbs rushed to the side of the tank
bascom followed with lagging feet
oddly reluctant the larger heavy cloud
was clustered now close to the base of
the negative electrode outlines were
gone all trace that once it had been a
human body a mere mist trailed back-
ward toward the positive electrode
faded almost to nothingness then it
thickened gradually until some five feet
away it became a small thin cloud of
migrating ions

  test it with the mass spectograph
stubbs ordered eyes glinting with
strange lights but ken was already
at the instrument two long tubes ex-
tended into the tank three inches apart
and connected outside with the spectro-
graph their ends protruded exactly


astounding stories

to the point at which the cloud of ions
was vaguest

  ken opened a valve there was a
hissing sound as a tiny amount of the
gelatin sucked along the two tubes into
the chamber of the instrument he
then adjusted sights watched intently
when he lifted his head it was hard
for him to keep his voice matter-of-
fact coldly scientific

  the division is complete he an-
nounced all the light ions are in the
right-hand sample the heavier ones are
wholly to the left

  stubbs raced swiftly to the master
switch opened the interlocking knife
edges the current shut off the gela-
tinous substance within the tank heaved
shuddered and came to a deathly quies-
cence the two blobs of matter hung
motionless in its depths

  the scientist returned to a huge
cameralike affair that faced the tank
he swung it slowly until its great lens
was focused sharply on the larger blob
of matter he pressed a button a
violet glow sprang out in a cylinder of
radiance to bathe the formless mass of
ions and their supporting medium with
its eerie light

  the experiment is through fin-
ished he turned to bascom exult-
antly weve done it before with
animals now it has been successful
with human beings youve just
watched something epochal something
that may mean the beginning of a new
era for the world

  i dont understand the doctor
stammered staring at the still formless
cloud horty is dead vanished even
though you did split him up into his
component isotopes

  not at all this machine is my
crowning triumph i call it the rein-
tegrator that ray you see is a com-
plex of a thousand different wave
lengths they come from a pattern
within a pattern which corresponds ex-
actly to the form of the human body

as they impinge on the disorganized
ions they exercise a selective influence
and compel the various atoms to migrate
to the particular wave length to which
it is attuned there will be formed
with the gelatin an exact replica of what
had once been james horty watch
bascom watched and felt the hair
bristle on his neck all over his body
slowly but surely the vague amor-
phous mass was taking shape and form
as the violet light continued to glow
steadily and strongly within the tank
the cloud lengthened shifted with in-
ternal movement showed strange wa-
vering outlines the outlines hardened
the mass grew darker and more solid
before the doctors aghast gaze crea-
tion was taking place legs appeared
arms fluid as yet but shaping into
plastic form then a face-a terrible
hideous thing

iv

 suddenly the whole mass shud-
dered as if from some strange inner
compulsion and behold jim horty
lay motionless nude eyes closed near
the negative electrode even as he had
lain hardly an hour before at the base
of the positive electrode

  dr bascom gave vent to a strangled
cry jerked forward there was no
change no slightest difference that he
could see

  naturally-stubbs answered his
unspoken thought-over ninety-nine
per cent of his physical elements are
present you wouldnt expect to notice
any difference even a scale would
show him only about a pound lighter
than before

  is-is he alive bascom whispered
of course there would be no point
to the experiment otherwise as soon
as i remove him from the gelatinous
base and the narcotic wears off hell
awake as though nothing had happened
stubbs chuckled and to ken there was
the isotope men



something inhuman about that chuckle
of course hell be a new personality
t may be a close approximation to his
old one or it may prove entirely new
it all depends on how powerful his re-
cessive personalities were to what ex-
tent they masked this particular domi-
nant remember he is now composed
of a pure set of isotope elements

  the doctor shifted his eyes fearfully
to the tiny cloud of formless ions far-
ther up the tank and-that

  the heavier slower isotopes
stubbs explained less than one per
cent of the total body as you see yet
containing the same relative proportions
of the elements of hortys body as the
other it was a much more difficult
problem to bring that personality to life
but i solved it the reintegrator will
form the pattern of the body just as
in the other case but it will be a mere
ghost a tenuous thing naturally for
one per cent of matter will be spread
over a volume of space that normally
holds one hundred per cent

  but i will feed the necessary addi-
tional elements into the tank and un-
der the influence of the pulsing waves
they will penetrate the area and arrange
themselves selectively in their proper
places food for the growing body you
might consider it within a few hours
another james horty will lie side by
side with the one now visible

  stubbs was already moving toward
the reintegrator but ken craig was
there ahead of him his face was
white with strain but his voice was
steady

  ive gone along with you this far
mr stubbs he said even though it
was against my better judgment i told
you and i still think we are playing
with incalculable forces forces that may
prove entirely beyond our control no-
where in nature have we found isotopes
in their pure elemental form always
they are mixed in definite proportions
with their fellows there must be some

reason for it some stability ttfat is thus
acquired were trying to change all
that were doing more were work-
ing with human beings human charac-
teristics the most explosive possibilities
in all nature you know as well as i
the status of cases of dual or multiple
personalities they are pathologic dis-
eased there is always something
wrong about them something abnor-
mal

  ken took a deep breath went on
as i said i was willing to go along
up to this point he pointed to the
still immersed still unmoving form of
horty that particular isotopic form
is incalculable but fairly safe within
certain limits it was the dominant
the norm to a large extent of the be-
ing the world knew before as horty
very likely he will not prove ap-
preciably different but that other
horty the one who still is a cloud of
unrelated ions the one-per-cent being
whom you wish to build up into a whole
man-what will he turn out to be we
have no way of telling the animals
we worked with could give us no an-
swers their physical forms and prop-
erties were the same as those of their
mates but we knew nothing of their in-
tellectual their emotional processes

  this horty will be a pure recessive
something that never existed before in
the history of the world what mon-
strosity may he not turn out to be
what danger may there not be implicit
in him for the rest of normal human-
ity

  stuff and nonsense stubbs inter-
rupted angrily weve been over that
ground before the books are full of
cases of dissociated personalities my
brother was an example none of them
was a monstrosity youre letting your
imagination run wild craig

  but they ken argued were all
compact within the same body the
other personalities though dormant
must surely have had some braking

here we are separating them com-
pletely removing all restraint all inhibi-

and mr hyde

	bah a scientist citing fiction
  sometimes ken answered seri-

ously a novelists intuitional genius
hews mighty close to the truth

  stubbs face darkened ive wasted
enough time listening to your silly
croakings he snapped now get out
of my way and let me go on with the
experiment

the features were still there but curiously misty as they
groped away from the positive electrode


astounding stories

  ken squared his shoulders determin-
edly come what may he would not
permit that other horty to be reinteg-
rated for a second the two men glared
at each other then stubbs moved for-
ward

  just a moment the scientist
jerked around at this new interruption
it was dr bascom red of face breath-
ing hard

  what is it this time stubbs
growled

  the prison doctor spoke rapidly in
the absence of warden parker i am in
charge here mr craig has said enough
to convince me that he is right i will
not allow you to proceed any further

  i have the governors order the
scientist told him furiously

  ive read it bascom responded
quietly it states that james horty
be turned over to you for experimental
purposes it is not a pardon  it says
nothing about remitting his execution as
a condemned criminal in the absence
of higher authority i shall construe it
myself horty must die according to
law

 stubbs hands clenched vio-
lently his eyes blazed so menacing
was his attitude that bascom shrank
against the wall not he ventured
hurriedly that im stopping your ex-
periment altogether horty must die
that-that part which is still unformed
is horty if that dies the law is satis-
fied the other horty is yours-to live
to do with as you please one finger
was close to a signal button if that
is not satisfactory ill have to call the
guards

  for a long moment stubbs stood
stock-still clenching and unclenching his
hands the veins on his forehead
swelled dangerously his eye swept
from defiant assistant to bascom and
back again ken had not moved from
the controls

  very well then he acquiesced sud-

  denly craig help me lift mr horty
out of the tank

  kens withheld breath exploded with
relief that was better he was sure
stubbs would soon realize the justice
of his argument agree with him he
sprang to the mechanism that actuated
the crane at the negative electrode the
wire cradle dipped swiftly into the gela-
tin closed beneath the immobile figure
and lifted it dripping blobs of jelly out
into the open

  the agitation of the jelly substance
scattered the small cloud that had hung
suspended in colloidal solution roiled
the ions into irreplacable confusion
the other horty was no more was now
dead scientifically as well as legally the
letter of the law had been observed
horty had died under the auspices of
the state yet horty still lived a par-
adox which occupied some space in the
prison doctors thoughts but none at
all in kens he was a scientist not a
lawyer

  together the two scientists heaved at
the body carried it to a specially pre-
pared table light-radiant machines
pulsed into action healing life-giving
radiations glowed over the rigid limbs

  the tension in the room reached in-
supportable heights the three men
watched eagerly waiting would the
isotopic horty come to life as the
smaller less highly organized animals
had done if so what would he be
like questions that could only be an-
swered by the thing that still rested
stolidly on the table in the minds of
at least two of the three the sharp dis-
pute of a minute before was forgotten
a sealed book

  seconds passed grew into minutes
the minutes ticked off interminably
and still horty did not move did not
breathe strange emotions stirred in
ken as a scientist he felt sickening
despair at the apparent failure of the
experiment as a man a human being
he was secretly glad there were im-
the isotope men



plications in its success that he feared to
face his gaze clung to the extended
body it was horty in every lineament
and feature

  the mans eyelids fluttered suddenly
under the beating light his limbs
twitched  the warm color of life infused
his limbs a simultaneous exclamation
broke from the three men they re-
mained rooted to the ground unable to
move it was a resurrection of the more
than dead

  jim horty yawned opened his eyes
looked bewilderedly about him slowly
he raised himself to a sitting position
on the table he blinked in the dazzle-
ment of the lamps

  ken sprang forward turned them off
youre all right now horty he
soothed take it easy here are your
clothes

 the man looked at him then at
the others with a puzzled abstracted air
then he looked down at his ill-fitting
stripes he made a gesture of distaste
but he put them  obediently then
he swung to the floor a shudder rip-
pled over him he passed his hand
over his eyes as if trying to obliterate
an awful vision

  you know he said slowly and ken
noted with thumping heart that though
it was the voice of horty yet the dic-
tion the modulations had changed be-
come softer more precise i had a
dream and it was a terrible one i
must have fallen asleep

  he looked again at his prison clothes
at dr bascom then he smiled wryly
somehow his brutish features were suf-
fused with new light im to be exe-
cuted am i not well im ready for
it the sentence was fair and just i
was a murderer funny though and
again that puzzled look crept into his
eyes i must have been crazy doing
the things i did robbery murder
why i-i wouldnt hurt a fly o k
di bascom lets get over with it

  the prison doctors eyes were liter-
ally popping out of his head his mind
whirled incoherently his pudgy fin-
ger trembled toward the tank you-

you were- but the doctor couldnt

go on

  what the doctor is trying to say
ken broke in sharply is that you have
been pardoned we just received word
from the governor youre a free man
horty

  the reintegrated man stared at him
incredulously then surprisingly tears
rolled down cheeks that had never felt
their channeled coursing before
tliank god he murmured reverently
it is beyond my deserts my crimes
were many and horrible and should

have been expiated but now-

his shoulders squared already the
heavy cunning set of his features was
subtly changing shifting with inner
transformation new life awaits me
i feel things stirring here-inside his
hand went to his breast i want to
learn to do things to help my fellow
men to keep them from the paths that
i once trod

  ken thrilled with glad relief the
miracle had happened this strange
new personality this being who had
sloughed less than a hundredth of his
former being was refined of all dross
in the isotope reintegration there was
no question about it hortys tones rang
with sincerity with conviction kens
glance shifted to the murky diffusion in
the tank and shivered suddenly

  what unutterable evil must have in-
hered in that minute residue to have
masked this greater personality to make
jim horty what he bad been-a vicious
criminal without a single redeeming hu-
man quality stubbs must see now that
he was right had been terribly right all
along never again would he attempt
to associate that dissociated discarded
personality

  meanwhile the scientist was staring
with devouring eyes at this being who


astounding stories

was incredibly his own creation he
felt drunk with godlike powers fame
power illimitable beckoned dizzily in
his long bony hands rested the future
of the world as in a glass darkly he
saw the marvelous possibilities ahead
a race of beings dissociated into pure
states no longer inhibited by clinging
dragging personalities what might
they not achieve

  but ken had sensed the elements of
danger was even now revolving in his
mind the means of eliminating them
not so stubbs his single-track brain
rejected all compromise contemptuously
his fanatical regard for science for
certain still inchoate thoughts permit-
ted no social elements no humanitarian
aspects to interfere with the course of
pure experiment craig and bascom
had stopped him this once a grim
unpleasant smile played over his angular
features next time-

 they took jim horty back with
them to the stubbs laboratories on the
outskirts of the metropolis they hus-
tled him out secretly wrapped in a muf-
fling overcoat and whizzed him in a
shade-drawn sedan down congested
arteries of traffic dr bascom and
warden parker had insisted on that
there was to be no publicity until they
could communicate with the governor
and clear themselves of official respon-
sibility in this very complex and unpre-
cedented situation

  yet they had not escaped unobserved
an enterprising reporter who had
smelled a story in the abrupt refusal to
admit outside witnesses to the execu-
tion of the notorious jim horty lurked
outside the prison walls waiting for
something to break he saw the huge
gate swing open the long black-
shrouded car slide through suspicious
alert he followed his hunch kicked the
starter of his ancient car into life and

ratded after it in close pursuit traffic
being what it was he was able to keep
the speeding car in sight

  when it turned into the side road
leading to malcolm stubbs heavily en-
dowed laboratories he was sure he had
made no mistake when his car half
hidden by masking shade trees he saw
stubbs and his assistant ken craig
emerge and solicitously help down a
figure swathed in a huge coat his ex-
citement grew when just as the trio
crunched up the gravel walk the coat
collar fell away momentarily to reveal
the only too well-known features of the
criminal the news hawk knew he had
a whale of a story

  one hour later to the dot wild head-
lines flooded the city streets jim
horty notorious mur-
derer spirited secretly
from jail on morn of exe-
cution seen in custody of
famous scientist

  within an hour and a half hordes
of reporters were clamoring for admis-
sion to the laboratories warden par-
ker was denying himself to all and sun-
dry  the governor immured behind
bodyguards in the executive mansion
had discreetly disconnected the long dis-
tance telephone the story had broken
with a vengeance

  but before all that happened another
drama more personal in its nature and
less world-shaking in its implications
was taking place within the close con-
fines of the stubbs laboratories

  the three men had hurried into the
living quarters horty sagged into a
chair still physically unstrung from the
terrific transformation he had under-
gone still mentally fumbling to express
the inner changes that he felt

  ken shrugged his coat off eagerly
he was brimming over with plans with
new experiments which opened before
him in never-ending vistas at the trium-
phantly successful conclusion of this
crucial test he wanted to get into the
the isotope men



laboratory at once to suggest certain
problems to stubbs he had forgotten
completely the late unpleasantness in the
converted workshop of the prison

  but stubbs had not he had sat
stiffly in the car while ken drove
wrapped in impenetrable silence nurs-
ing his anger maturing certain plans of
his own

  you had better put your coat on
again craig his voice was tinged
venom

  ken stopped short why he asked
in some surprise are we going out
you are going out stubbs an-
swered vindictively

  what do you mean

  i mean mr craig stubbs retorted
you are discharged fired no longer in
my employ

  ken braced himself i see he
said quietly you want your assistant
to be a yes-man you want no brake
on your inordinate ambitions you are
a great scientist mr stubbs but you
havent the true scientific spirit i
saved you a little while ago from an
experiment that might have ended dis-
astrously not only for us but for the
human race you are now venting your
spite on me for that you are afraid
that i might try to prevent you again
you are right i would im warning
you again think long and hard be-
fore you even repeat what we have done
so far make sure there are no secret
defects wait at least a year for them
to appear that is the way of science
that is what distinguishes research from
charlatanry

  get out stubbs growled his voice
thick with passion

  good-by ken answered evenly
and remember what i said

  slowly he turned toward the door
it was a wrench this being cast off at
the moment of fruition he knew that
stubbs wanted to hog all the limelight
for himself that did not matter ken

preferred to remain in the background
even though he had contributed toward
this particular bit of work more than
stubbs was willing to admit but the
epochal experiment was only begin-
ning

  horty the pure isotopic man was
not merely a scientific problem he was
a human a social problem stubbs was
not the man to cope with that side of
the situation properly ken felt a sink-
ing sensation what did stubbs intend
doing next

  horty stared bewilderedly from one
to the other during the altercation
somehow his new personality instinc-
tively trusted ken craig and just as in-
stinctively shrank from the cold angu-
larities of stubbs

  mr craig he called suddenly

  ken stopped turned looked at him
inquiringly

  horty blushed-a novel sensation
his heavy features worked with strange
emotion i-i would like to go with
you he stammered diffidently

  no you dont stubbs snarled
you stay here with me as long as i
want you youre my experiment he
was shouting now and im not through
with you by a long shot

  but i dont understand horty an-
swered helplessly i thought the gov-
ernor had pardoned me that i was
free

  free the scientist echoed sardoni-
cally and laughed it was not a pleasant
laugh youre dead horty do you
understand the legal part of you is
back there in prison scattered into in-
distinguishable atoms youre just a
resurrected chattel a mere part of a
man an experimental creature

  a frightened look crept into hortys
eyes is that true what hes saying
he appealed to ken

  the young scientist controlled his
seething anger with an effort he had
not known stubbs could be so brutal
only in part he said gently but


astounding stories

im afraid youll have to stay here until
i can get in touch with the governor

  the governor will back me up
stubbs informed him nastily i have
enough influence for that

 that afternoon ensconced
in the home of an old college friend
ken saw the newspapers the storm
had broken in a torrent of headlines
stubbs in his eagerness for adulation
for fame beyond that of any living be-
ing had broken his pledge of secrecy
the doors had been thrown wide open
to the reporters stubbs had spoken on
and on had squeezed the last ounce of
publicity from the interviews

  horty had been exhibited prodded
as though he were a guinea pig no-
where in all the innumerable details
was there any mention of kenneth
craig it was stubbs malcolm stubbs
from beginning to end

  bill maynard threw the papers down
with a chuckle you evidently were
the janitor or housemaid in that estab-
lishment ken

  william maynard had roomed with
craig at college before their paths di-
verged into their respective fields he
was a psychologist of repute one of the
younger generation who was pushing
brilliantly to the fore he dismissed as
nonsense the mystical terms with which
psychology was all too often impenetra-
bly inwrapped psychology was a sci-
ence he proclaimed or nothing at all
as such its practitioner must have a
good working equipment of the other
sciences and must discard as idle theory
all that was not susceptible of rigorous
proof

  craig groaned that doesnt bother
me one bit bill he said earnestly im
thinking of poor horty for one and the
future of the human race for another

  maynard sobered youre right
he answered thoughtfully this busi-
ness is right down my alley its the
biggest most important discovery since

-since-why blazes man its the big-
gest in the history of mankind mak-
ing two human beings where there was
one before splitting a man into his
pure component parts its tremen-
dous its more its ghastly i know
a little something about the workings
of the human mind you cant take
away what was an integral part without
hell popping somewhere sometime
mark my word were not through with
horty by a long shot which was a
prediction to be fulfilled in a most un-
expected astonishing way

  when ken was finally able to break
through to the governor it was too late
stubbs had brought his powerful influ-
ence to bear first ken was informed
politely but firmly by a third assistant
secretary that the new creation that was
horty was the exclusive ward of mr
malcolm stubbs the great scientist
and that was that

  ken lived in seclusion at bill may-
nards for the next few weeks his
friend had generously given him the run
of the house of his psychological labo-
ratory and also sufficient money to pro-
vide for his modest needs and even
more modest equipment there were
certain tests ken wanted to make even
though he could not hope to duplicate
the very expensive and elaborate re-
sources of the stubbs endowment

  for two weeks the sensation grew
and grew the fact that there was a
war in europe pregnant with sinister
possibilities of universal embroilment
the fact that the west had broken out
in a rash of fierce bloody strikes the
fact that china was going communist
and india was in revolt were all re-
legated to inside pages next to the obit-
uary columns and wholly overlooked by
the average man

  scientists trooped from all over the
world to the stubbs laboratories count-
less thousands of sight-seers milled day
and night before the heavily guarded
portals battling for a glimpse of the
the isotope men



man who had been through the shadow
of death and returned a strange new
personality

  the isotopic man he was chris-
tened by a phrase-making editor and
the name stuck he was examined
prodded exhibited lectured on his sub-
conscious probed his unconscious too
by psychologists pickcd by stubbs

  bill maynard applied for permission
and was turned down horty was given
intelligence tests lie detectors were
strapped to him questionnaires sensible
and silly alike bombarded his bewil-
dered head in short he was not a hu-
man being he was a guinea pig de-
voted to the cause of so-called science

  ken fumed whatever chance there
had been of calm scientific consideration
of the results of their remarkable ex-
periment was gone forever

  he should have been placed in nor-
mal human and social surroundings he
raged into bills sympathetic ear
then and then only could we have de-
termined whether a pure dissociated
personality was advantageous to the in-
dividual himself and to society or not
but now with this horrible ballyhoo
and roar of publicity nothing that
horty may develop into will mean a
thing scientifically

 the uproar continued grew to
hurricane proportions stubbs revealed
himself as a master of artful propa-
ganda as a genius for self-advertise-
ment the whole world laid all else
aside lapped up with insatiable thirst
the endless bulletins that paraded from
the stubbs laboratories the investiga-
tion of the imported psychologists sci-
entists sociologists what not were put
in printed form and sold by the mil-
lions

  ken and bill read them eagerly the
men were competent in their fields the
reports as far as they went were hon-
est there was no question that james
horty was a distinctly new personality

the criminal tle cruel murderer the
man with the twisted brain and the low
cunning of the underworld had van-
ished the new horty was humble
kind sensitive to the sufferings of the
tiniest insect eager to learn and withal
mightily bewildered by the tremendous
hullabaloo of which he was the center

  bill read them through and tossed
them across the room with a profane
gesture superficial hooey he re-
marked disgustedly tests any child
could give the all-important things
have been left discreetly untouched
what for example has happened to the
vacuum created by the loss of the heavy
isotopic personality  he is not a whole
man he is only ninety-nine per cent of
one has he been confronted with any
moral situation which requires quick
volitionless decisions how have his
instincts been affected a million and
one problems that have been left un-
touched

  and were to remaiin untouched for
soon the machiavellian hand of stubbs
disclosed itself-what he had been se-
cretly planning for throughout the un-
precedented exploitation

  one day the bombshell burst the
newspapers fairly shrieked with it a
hundred selected members of the un-
employed were to be subjected to the
dissociation apparatus of stubbs were
to be reintegrated as pure isotope per-
sonalities the way had been prepared
the proper officials had been convinced

  look what happened to horty the
condemned murderer the man whom
society had given up as hopeless
stubbs had argued to the high and
mighty individuals whose consent was
necessary if such a remarkable trans-
formation occurred with such unpromis-
ing material what might we not expect
from men higher up on the scale after
all these unemployed are a drain on
the community the reason they have
lost out in the struggle for existence
is because their separate personalities


astounding stories

are constantly clashing constantly in-
hibiting each other and making their
net efforts futile

  this of course was a wild general-
ization on the part of stubbs based on
no ascertainable evidence certainly on
nothing involved in the investigation of
hortys case but the highly placed offi-
cials did not know that and stubbs was
now a figure of international impor-
tance

  furthermore anything that would
take these men off relief was eagerly to
be grasped taxes were mounting
heavily and certain powerful business
men were complaining so consent was
granted all in the name of science

  such was the power of propaganda
that the idea was at once universally
acclaimed no one raised his voice in
objection no one that is except the
selected hundred and their families but
their protests were swept aside as im-
pertinent and showing a dangerous
tendency toward radicalism

  what do these ignorant protestors
against the march of scientific progress
expect one influential newspaper edi-
torialized indignantly that they are
to be kept on the relief rolls indefinitely
at the expense of more capable and
more industrious citizens here is a
chance for them to be remade so to
speak so that they may earn their own
livings and not rely supinely on the
bounty of others yet they protest pro-
test forsooth if anything proved the
necessity of their submission to mr
stubbs process it is the very fact that
they do object

  ken craig and bill maynard ob-
jected too but no one listened one
editor who took the matter up with
stubbs was told that craig was a dis-
gruntled employee whom he had been
compelled to discharge for utter incom-
petency and worse and thereafter ken
was persona non grata in all the forums
where public opinion is plastically
molded

  so with a fanfare of trumpets and
editorial handsprings the great experi-
ment went through a huge tract of
land was set aside for experimental pur-
poses high barbed fences surrounded
the hastily erected buildings armed
guards patrolled the grounds day and
night the disconsolate men were torn
from their weeping families and hustled
into the inclosure a series of tanks
had been set up with a multiplication
of mass spectrographs reintegrators
electrical generators healing rays and
other essential equipment stubbs was
preparing for large-scale production
funds were unlimited

 then came the fateful day the
unemployed were narcotized in batches
thrust into the tanks of gelatin duly
they were ionized dissociated reinte-
grated this time there was no ken
craig to croak warnings furthermore
a certain military gentleman had been
tremendously interested in the proceed-
ings not you understand in their sci-
entific aspects and certainly not in the
possible raising of the ethical stadards
or mental ability of the isotope men
it was the physical duplication or tripli-
cation even of available cannon fodder
that caught his undivided attention

  why he argued should this country
wait for the slow natural processes of
birth and growth here at one swift
stroke it was possible to double the man
power of the nation his mind dazzled
at the glittering vistas it opened of tre-
mendous armies called literally into ex-
istence with the aid of a scientific wand
he saw himself in the role of a new
alexander a new ghengis khan the
economic and social dislocations to a
country already staggering under a peak
load of unemployment did not enter his
simple calculations he was a soldier
a machine geared to one task only-
war so stubbs had the necessary back-
the isotope men



ing for what he had secretly intended
all along

  accordingly the reintegrators were
focused on all the inchoate masses of
isotope atoms as they moved with vary-
ing degrees of speed through the spe-
cially treated gelatin in five of the
hundred cases three personalities had
dissociated themselves under the selec-
tive thrust of the tremendous current

  the dominant isotopes the ninety-
nine-per-cent men were easily handled
the technique had already been mas-
tered thanks to kens unheralded un-
acknowledged researches the one-per-
centers or fractions thereof in the case
of the triple dissociations required more
careful consideration here though
ken had worked out the theoretic an-
swers for stubbs more than once the
great scientist fumbled and wished
vaguely that craig was back

  very carefully and very slowly the
requisite elements were injected into the
misty ghostlike wraiths of the un-
formed men-in tiny dosages in fixed
unalterable proportions and all the
while the reintegrators kept up their
steady patterned beat of rays molding
the new material into the interstices of
the sketchy personalities filling them in
gradually

  it was a delicate process and stubbs
did not possess his former assistants
sureness of touch as a result there
were many casualties personalities that
vanished again into irretrievable con-
glomerations of atoms and there were
others that did not vanish that actually
came to life these because of the
bungling technique were such mon-
strosities such frightening apparitions
out of a mythical wonder-working past
that stubbs secretly and in scared haste
destroyed them with powerful corrosives
as they lay quiescent immobile within
the transparencies of the gelatin

  for minutes after he sat gasping and
shuddering in his chair he had been
gi n an intimate vision of the inner-

most hells of deformity of things that
only a dore or a daumier could have
drawn suppose he thought with a
shiver these physical gargoyles he had
just destroyed had mental counterparts
hidden underneath the normal human
exteriors that lay in the other tanks
was that whippersnapper craig right
after all were these recessive isotopes
pure unmitigated evil held only in
check by the dominant personalities
was he playing with forces that might
prove uncontrollable

  it was only for a moment that these
doubts assailed him however he even
laughed sardonically at himself he
the great malcolm stubbs pausing in
his triumphant career because of silly
warnings the experiment was suc-
cessful there was no doubt about that
of the dominant isotopes every one of
the hundred was even now stirring back
to life under the ministrations of dis-
creet assistants chosen more for their
manual dexterity and humble fidelity
than for brilliant scientific achievement
and of the recessive personalities some
fifty-odd were salvaged expanding with
the warm hues of life under the heal-
ing rays an excellent percentage
stubbs exulted in righteous self-satis-
faction

  the hundred dominant isotopes were
paraded for the delectation of a wildly
acclaiming world scientists went to
work upon them immediately the re-
sults were astonishing these had been
originally men of average intelligence
possibly a trifle subnormal accordng to
the good american gospel that talent
and industry must necessarily win ma-
terial success

 now however their intelli-
gence quotients ranged from  to 
evidencing remarkable mental agility
that fell just short of genius nor this
once were the figures misleading
placed experimentally at their former
jobs they outdistanced all their mates


astounding stories

shot meteorlike to the top of the heap
labor-saving devices efficient short
cuts machine improvements were sug-
gested by them in rapid succession
their hands were deft their brains
nimble

  big business was in an ecstasy
profits increased mightily in the indus-
tries favored by their presence it was
possible to cut down on working staffs
as a result normal human beings found
themselves swelling the ranks of the un-
employed a clamor arose for more of
these marvelously efficient isotopes
this time it was not necessary to con-
script subjects those who had been
thrown out of employment volunteered
eagerly the number of applicants
grew into the thousands the hundreds
of thousands

  stubbs set up auxiliary laboratories
turned them out in machine batches a
driving fanaticism held him to his task
his ego expanded inflated to tremen-
dous proportions his name was a
household word he was mightier than
kings and dictators the new isotopes
were now of all classes

  struggling authors imitative painters
whose work had never sold routine
laboratory technicians plodding busi-
ness men dissatisfied with their present
lot went eagerly into the dissociation
tanks

  within a month the isotope men had
made a bloodless conquest of the united
states hacks became geniuses petty
storekeepers grew into captains of in-
dustry  obscure scientists developed
world-shaking theories of einsteinian
proportions

  this made for unforeseen complica-
tions the former leaders in the arts
in science in industry were being ruth-
lessly thrust aside by the coldly efficient
isotope men no longer were they the
salt of the earth now they were aver-
age or even subaverage a wail arose
then one of the cast-off chemists a
former nobel winner had an idea if

the dissociation of personalities made
geniuses out of normal average mate-
rial what might it not do for those who
were initially men of talent of more
than talent

  tremblingly he submitted to the bath
while his fellows waited with bated
breath the result was astounding the
isotope chemist within a week had
solved problems in his field that had
been deemed insoluble a new element
was added to the list of those already
known and he announced that already
he was on the trail of practicable atom-
smashing

  thereupon all doubts ceased there
was a rush of hitherto world-fafnous
men for the dissociating bath stubbs
resources were taxed to the utmost a
new era was dawning for the earth a
race of supermen godlike in propor-
tions humanity transfigured rising
soon above the poor planet to which it
had been chained achieving the planets
nay the stars themselves

  certain small symptoms were un-
noted in the accelerating rush of events
symptoms however that held in them-
selves the seeds of destruction but
for the present the future was a shim-
mering mirage malcolm stubbs was
practical dictator of the world

  but he was no fool already he had
noted that these creations of his were
outstripping him in his own special
field in short order his carefully
guarded secret process would be dupli-
cated improved on and he the only
begetter and initiator-you see he had
by this time forgotten that kenneth
craig had ever existed-would be shoul-
dered aside just as the leaders in other
fields had been

  for in this new world of isotope men
there was no room for pity for com-
passion for the nice amenities of life
they were supermen hard efficient
ruthless-with the possible exception of
horty no inhibitions held them back
no recessive isotope personalities acted
the isotope men



as secret brakes they were single-pur-
posed driving subject to no doubts or
indecisions sometimes they pushed to
extravagant lengths on small matters
that normal people would not have both-
ered with the seeds of future diffi-
culties were there

  nor were they exactly happy there
were times when almost unbearable
aches stirred through them when every
atom it seemed yearned vaguely for
something that was missing for some-
thing they could not find these mani-
festations however were rare in the
beginning and of short duration the
spasms came and passed almost imme-
diately

  so one memorable day to the hosan-
nas of an excited world malcolm
stubbs stiff and immobile under the
narcotic was carefully lowered into his
own dissociation bath and two new
malcolm stubbs appeared in due course
to the sight of all and sundry

  we have not as yet discoursed
on the recessive isotopes the one-per-
centers who were fed and nurtured un-
til they became seemingly whole human
beings there had been good and suffi-
cient reason for this in the first place
it took time and considerable effort to
bring them to that state in the second
place it had been deemed wise to secrete
them from the general view even from
the sight and knowledge of their fellow
isotopes their complementary personal-
ities so to speak for they had proved
somewhat of a shock to stubbs

  in every limb in every feature in
every bodily mark and pattern they
were twins with their counterparts so
much so that it was positively frighten-
ing so much so that at first there were
several confused shufflings in which re-
cessives were sent out into the world
and dominants placed in camp

  the military gentleman had taken
charge of this second batch it would

not do to have identical twins between
whom it was impossible to differentiate
walking and living in the same paths of
existence the possibilities for confu-
sion for worse were obvious

  it would be somewhat of a shock for
a man to see his mirror image approach-
ing him in the street family life would
be subjected to certain alarming or
ludicrous situations and in industry
politics anything might happen

  so the recessives were spirited away
into a huge concentration camp in the
heart of the great smoky national
park by the end of six months there
were a hundred thousand of them the
military gentleman was in ecstasies he
trained them and drilled them daily in
the use of modern arms in the minutiae
of warfare soon he figured he would
have enough to start on his career of
conquest nothing less than the domi-
nation of the world floated before his
vision and that mind you without
tapping the regular man-strength of the
country without dislocating in the
slightest the normal processes of the
nation

  these recessives too had undergone
testings outwardly they were counter-
parts of their fellows inwardly how-
ever there was considerable difference
for one thing they were not supermen
their abilities did not run to the arts
the sciences to all the differentiating
talents that make of the human race an
endless and infinite variety rather
there was a certain essential sameness
about them all a certain monotony that
seemed to indicate a definite bedrock of
the human race

   this bothered stubbs vaguely at first
there was something terrifying in their
primitive alikeness they did what they
were told obediently yet sullenly
their intellects seemed subordinated to
the emotions to deep-seated instincts
this of course did not bother the mili-
tary gentleman in the slightest as a
matter of fact it was cause for further


astounding stories

congratulations ideal soldiers he
chortled good cannon fodder

  yet underneath flashing into mani-
festation like fireflies on a moonless
night and as suddenly extinguishing
were certain traits which escaped the
testing psychologists a certain secre-
tiveness a certain furtive cunning a
certain electrical sparkling between re-
cessive and recessive as if they were all
mystically united in a common bond of
racial integrity but their drilling and
obedient marching went on

  the new stubbs regained easily his
former leadership his bleak fanaticism
intensified all hesitancies all former
doubts were gone he became dicta-
tor of the americas he took over bag
and baggage the secret plans of the
military gentleman for his own use
much to the latters discomfiture with
inward raging and outer submission
that individual took subordinate com-
mand

  once and once only did the new
stubbs feel at a loss that was in the
beginning when the recessive stubbs
was brought before him he had had
sufficient intellectual curiosity to wish
to see his counterpart and he had felt
an understandable aversion to a part of
him being herded to the concentration
camp

  but that one experience was enough
every atom in his being flamed out to-
ward that other stubbs it was the
longing of a lover for his mate a mil-
lion times intensified a wrenching sick-
ening force that left him weak and
trembling and afraid

  had stubbs been a student of the
classics as was craig he would have
known what had happened would have
realized immediately to what dreadful
consequences his violent disruption of
the human complex into its pure iso-
topes was inevitably tending plato in
his symposium expressed the situation
in words and phrases that were a re-

markable prophecy of what stubbs had
actually achieved

  in the eyes of the recessive stubbs
a flame also leaped but it was not of
longing it was the flame of unquench-
able hatred for this physical counter-
part then almost at once it died into
blankness

  stubbs shivered take him away
he cried to his assistants send him
to the camp i dont ever want to see
him again submissively without
even a backward glance the other
stubbs shuffled out of the room and
was lost to his sight

vii

  during this six months of world
turmoil and tremendous seething
events ken craig and bill maynard re-
mained stubbornly aloof

  while the thousands rushed for the
dissociation tanks they stuck to their
laboratory normal whole human be-
ings in the new regime of supermen
they were anonymous individuals in-
conspicuous for learning for dazzling
new discoveries yet they were con-
tent

  the feeling had grown on them
through the great change that there was
something radically and terribly wrong
about it all they could not put exact
fingers on it but every time they en-
countered an isotope man the feeling
struck them with redoubled force

  as if ken remarked there were
a missing element as if any moment
the whole precariously balanced struc-
ture would tumble into disintegration
before our very eyes	-v

  yet the months passed and nothing
happened more and more went into
the baths there was hardly a man of
prominence of recognized ability and
talent in the united states who had
not been dissociated into his various
personalities only the dull average
the great mass of ordinarily anonymous

common hordes might have their turn

  meanwhile ken worked desperately
in his laboratory doing secret things
with mice and guinea pigs and poor
scared rabbits and always at crucial
points in the experiments he came up
against a dead wall beyond which there
seemed no further progress

   sometimes he told bill desperately
 i feel as if i too should dissociate
 perhaps my dominant phase might be

people were still what they had always
been a natural mixture of isotopes

  not that they wished for that un-
desirable state they clamored for dis-
sociation  they besieged stubbs with
eager cries it was physically impos-
sible as yet to handle millions those

as yet for your researches to be brought


astounding stories

to a head so far the isotopes seem to
be inheriting the earth

  i have a feeling that it wont last
much longer ken declared prophet-
ically and plunged back into his work
again

  he was right the first intimation
of trouble came from an entirely unex-
pected source one night just as ken
was leaving the laboratory in bleary-
eyed despair there came a timid yet
insistent knock on the front door

  bill in slippers and dressing gown
was comfortably ensconced in a lounge
chair reading the latest report of an
isotope psychologist on certain neuronic
paths in the cortices of the brain he
read on in fascinated interest here
in luminous detail were proved theories
at which he himself had only dimly nib-
bled he had known the man in his
pre-dissociated state as a dull plodding
sort of a fellow

  good night he muttered to him-
self perhaps ken is wrong after all
perhaps- then came the knock

  with an exclamation of annoyance
he shuffled his slippers to the door
while ken coming in from the lab
threw himself wearily into the chair he
had just vacated

  ken heard the door open saw the
dim muffled figure heard bills sharp
exclamation even when the midnight
intruder walked into the room he did
not at once raise his head

  then a voice timid yet filled with
strange excitement mr craig mr
craig

  he looked up quickly gasped be-
fore him stood a heavy low-browed in-
dividual with jutting jaw and unpre-
possessing features

  jim horty he cried

  the ex-condemned criminal was
quivering with unnamable dread yes
sir its me ive got to talk to you

  but where have you been you
dropped out of sight

  horty reddened as a matter of
fact from the most publicized man in
the world he had gradually been shuf-
fled into the background until even
stubbs had forgotten his very existence
he was free to come and go as he
pleased and when he finally disap-
peared no one seemed aware of it

 well-i-that is-he looked
around in some embarrassment-i was
sort of hanging around the camp in the
smokies

  what on earth for ken demanded
his embarrassment grew he
shifted his weight from leg to leg
well-i was sort of hoping id see
my other self you know the other
guy from whom you dissociated me
ken and bill exchanged quick sig-
nificant looks this was important it

might mean-

  there wasnt any other self jim
ken said kindly he was permitted to
die to-uh-satisfy the laws require-
ments

  oh horty gulped but that
wasnt what i wanted to tell you sir
hanging around like that i found out
something

  what

  the recessive fellows are revolting
theyve started already on the march
theyve got guns and bayonets and
everything they want to run the
world themselves they say theyve
no use for their other selves in fact
they hate them like poison

  ken jumped to his feet are you
sure of what you say he demanded
sharply

  certainly sir horty repeated dog-
gedly i saw them myself they
overpowered their guard killed them
all including genera hamilton that
was the military gentleman i just
managed to get away in time i got a
fellow to take me here in a plane i
knew you could do something about it
his pathetic admiration was wasted
on ken just what we were afraid
the isotope men



of bill he told his friend grimly
the recessives had masked their true
inner nature all this time waiting until
they could be sure of success they
are the fundamental brutes the ape-
men in us from whom we had risen so
slowly and painfully through the ages
we have torn them loose from their
overlaying selves the dominant isotopes
and now we must suffer for it

  bill wrinkled his forehead i dont
understand it he protested they
possess of course the primitive cunning
of their-or rather our-ancestors but
this move must have required organiza-
tion ability that i should have judged
beyond them

  i aint finished horty interrupted
in his eagerness his speech had reverted
they got a leader and hes-he
looked furtively around finished in a
whisper-mr stubbs

  what it was a simultaneous ex-
clamation of disbelief

  i seen him myself horty declared
stubbornly

  impossible bill retorted stubbs
just appeared on the teleview with an
announcement it showed him at the
laboratories besides what the devil
would he be wanting to revolt for
hes dictator right now

  hold on ken exclaimed in excite-
ment ive got it the man whom
horty saw was stubbs all right the
other stubbs the recessive that
stubbs the dominant must have hus-
tled to camp to get rid of i could well
understand why ken moved quickly
toward the door

  where are you going bill ex-
claimed

  to warn stubbs he brought it on
himself and i certainly dont feel par-
ticularly kindly toward him but this
is different the fate of the world is
involved let those recessives gain

control and- his voice trailed off

but it was only too evident what he had
in mind

  im coming too bill decided

  two minutes later the three men were
sliding swiftly through the deserted
early-morning streets of new york
pushing their car to the utmost up
through the bronx they raced up the
albany post road flinging left into the
side road that led to the stubbs labo-
ratories with a scream of recalcitrant
tires

  stubbs awakened at their insist-
ence viewed craig with cold hate-filled
eyes somehow he felt his former as-
sistant to be a threat against the new
order he had created ken returned
his look with interest but there was no
time for that he explained rapidly

  incredulity lurked in the dictators
gaze when he had finished even after
hortys breathless corroboration the
name of the rebels leader brought a
sharp pang to his system a resurgence
of that former overwhelming feeling
mingled inextricably with queer dread
he had tried to school himself against
the thought of that other ego so like
himself yet so different

  if this is a hoax he said angrily

ill- he left the threat hanging

moved toward his commuincations
visor even as he did so it buzzed
sprang into life a badly frightened
isotope governor of the southeastern
coastal district leaped into being

  the recessives have broken loose
he gasped a hundred thousand of
them they-theyre animals sir
theyre killing and burning and wal-
lowing in blood theyre attacking the
town now guns modern artillery
everything we cant hold out much
longer unless we get help

  a concussion of sound shook the
televisor the governor jerked around
threw up his hand in terror to the
rear a door burst inward and a horde
of savage-looking men streamed in be-
fore the helpless horrified eyes of the
onlookers they deliberately bayoneted


astounding stories

the governor stabbing again and again
with fiendish delight then they threw
themselves down on the blood-smeared
floor and lapped with greedy tongues
at the thing they had mangled bill
felt suddenly sick he could look at
that far-off scene no longer

  one of the creatures raised himself
saw the televisor for one long mo-
ment stubbs the recessive stared with
hate-filled triumphant gaze into the
paralyzed eyes of stubbs the dominant
isotope confronted isotope then very
deliberately his fist lifted and the
image shattered with a shiver of broken
glass the visor screen went blank

  now do you believe ken asked
bitterly he was shaken to his very
core by what he had seen yet even in
his bitterness his anger against this
man who was solely responsible for the
horror that had been unloosed upon the
world he felt quick pity

  stubbs stood there rigid immobile
his face more angular in its sudden hol-
lowness than ever before he had seen
himself the thing he had held in leash
all his life and now had freed into the
very embodiment of primitive evil

  you were right craig he whis-
pered through stiff lips and i was
wrong i have done a damnable thing
no one could know what that confes-
sion that apology cost him

  then his face hardened he sprang
to the visor screen pressed button after
button orders crackled from his lips
with machine-gun rapidity the super-
men were being mobilized strange
weapons of offense and defense that
ken had never heard of were named
for instant use the isotope scientists
had evolved terrible engines of destruc-
tion yet always monotonously re-
iterated stubbs insisted to all his sub-
ordinates  the recessive stubbs my
isotope is not to be harmed on peril
of your head seize him guard him
well and bring him to me

 craig and maynard went
with the first army that had been mobil-
ized to suppress the rebellion horty
refused to go the erstwhile criminal
looked sick at the very thought kill-
ing a human being he declared even
in self-defense was murder

  the unit moved swiftly in small mo-
torized tanks capable of a hundred miles
an hour over the most rugged terrain
the superisotopes were grim purpose-
ful efficient in their every move

  stubbs bleak and craggy as ever led
the van ken and bill sat at his side
marveling at the smoothness with which
the beryllium-steel tank ripped down
the southern highways

  reports came to them at five-minute
intervals by radio from fast scout
planes the rebels had scattered were
traveling now in small bands mopping
up the countryside with remorseless
thoroughness ken saw the results of
their handiwork as the tank entered the
devastated area it was frightful
hideous

  everywhere were smoking ruins
everywhere the butchered bodies of
men women and children stared up
with sightless eyes at the smoke-grimed
skies

  kens eyes narrowed bill muttered
good lord over and over but
stubbs maintained a flinty silence his
eyes passed over and through the sham-
bles with far-off blankness

  early that afternoon they made con-
tact the ether cracked with messages
a scout plane reported the presence of
a large body of the recessives at the
site of what had once been charlotte-
ville now it was a pillar of fire and
a cloud of smoke in which the dim-
seen forms of the yelling horde seemed
like sooty demons

  stubbs snapped out orders into the
transmitter unit the tanks wheeled
swiftly surged with smooth endless
the isotope men



motion over fire-seared earth toward the
beleaguered town the distance was
eighty miles they made it in fifty
minutes

  kens hands clenched fiercely as they
swept over a ridge saw the shambles
ahead a half dozen planes were div-
ing headlong recklessly toward the
flame-shot ruining town tiny figures
squatted on the ground pointing long-
barreled anti-aircraft guns at the diving
targets the earth shook with the
thunder of exploding bombs the dull
concussions of motorized artillery the
lurid flare of burning houses made a
sinister back-drop to a hellish scene

  one by one the planes jerked in mid-
air as if on a string crashed in flaming
destruction to the ground

  for heavens sake stubbs ken
exclaimed give the signal to attack

  but the isotope scientist made no
move his eye was glued to the tele-
periscope that angled through the ar-
mored roof of the tank straining with
desperate eagerness to distinguish those
far-of figures-as though he were seek-
ing for some one he dreaded to see

  but the recessives were already aware
of the appearance of these new enemies
huge guns swiveled around puffs of
white smoke rose lazily the air was
suddenly filled with whining concus-
sions two of the tanks shuddered
heaved and exploded into a thousand
hurtling fragments

  the transmitter buzzed with angry
clamor why wasnt stubbs signaling
an attack were they to wait until they
were picked off one by one

  but still the scientist said nothing
he seemed in a trance a moveless fig-
ure at the periscope shells hurtled by
searing the atmosphere with the friction
of their flight another tank disin-
tegrated

  what the devil bill ejaculated if
i only knew how to manipulate these
damned weapons

  but ken had sprung to the radio

shouldering stubbs rudely out of the
way he flipped the transmitter open
barked out orders in the staccato brit-
tle accents of the bemused dictator

  a roar of acquiescence swept back
through the ether tiny blue flames
flickered from outlets in the smooth
surfaces of the still-surviving tanks
ridiculous little lights that seemed to
end not a foot away from the point of
origin

  yet ken watching the distant town
through the view porte gasped in in-
credulous astonishment guns men
motors even the back-drop of flaring
embers seemed to whiff out of exist-
ence in a long clean swath a deep
cone-shaped furrow extended suddenly
through smoking fields with its apex at
the tanks and its base the obliterated
town

  what-what was that

  stubbs looked dully at him there
seemed unaccountable fear in his eyes
and his angular face was quivering
that he echoed merely an atomic
disintegrator nothing at all

  great heavens ken exploded
you mean to say you discovered that
principle already

  mere childs play the scientist an-
swered indifferently half a dozen
men came upon it simultaneously but

when-

  the radio drowned him out dis-
trict supervisor graham calling the
commander

  stubbs opened the transmitter
what is it  he asked wearily

  sir weve located the main body of
the recessives theyre intrenched on
a mountain five miles due southeast
from hagerstown weve just comc up
with them sir what are your orders 
attack of course what are you
waiting for

  the unseen voice seemed to hesitate
when it came through again it sounded
apologetic even a bit afraid i dont


astounding stories

know whats come over our men sir
i-i wish youd come up and take com-
mand yourself

  ill be there in an hour graham
stubbs snapped too bad you cant
handle the situation yourself he fin-
ished sarcastically

  that will be splendid sir graham
answered eagerly and his voice stilled

  exactly an hour later the tanks
pushed up the steep slope to the hud-
dled ranks of the isotopes some ten
thousand there were with strange
squat-looking machines in serried rows
their wide gaping mouths pointing up-
ward at the mountaintop there
seemed trouble among the isotopes
they were gesticulating and arguing an-
grily among themselves

  stubbs jerked out of the tank
stormily the strange paralysis that
clogged his faculties back at charlotte-
ville had fallen from him like an out-
worn cloak

  ken and bill hurried out after him
kens brows were knitted there was
definitely something wrong with stubbs
with the isotopes in general but puz-
zled as he might the solution had not
dawned on him as yet though some-
thing horty had said the night before
in new york should have been suffi-
cient hint to piece the riddle together

  graham the supervisor saw them
coming extricated himself from a knot
of quarreling isotopes hurried toward
them a desperate anguish struggled
mightily on his harried features with
the respect due the dictator

  but the three men and their follow-
ers from the other tanks stopped short
suddenly they had seen 

  up the mountain not two hundred
yards away a skillfully enfiladed series
of trenches bit deep into the soil the
mountains flanks were broad and the
trenches stretched interminably up and
up a hundred thousand men could
lie concealed within those zigzagging
slashes

  but it was not that which stopped
them dead in their tracks brought low
exclamations to their lips

  along the nearest trench boldly
exposed to the weapons of the super-
isotopes men were parading carelessly
unconcernedly recessives weaponless
marching back and forth in slow pac-
ing movement fronting them with grin-
ning countenance anxious to be seen
to be observed by every member of the
hostile force

  a tank man screamed suddenly un-
believingly look there i am up
there

  ken followed his pointing finger
the man was right his simulacrum
his mirror image stared down from the
trench rim alike in every lineament
in every trick of gesture only the
clothes were different

  graham came up puffing thats
whats wrong sir he reported in pant-
ing hurried tones to stubbs thats
why i couldnt attack the recessives
are watching us through powerful tele-
scopes every time our gunners man
the disintegrators they exrose their dis-
sociated doubles to our view-and the
men refuse to fire swear they couldnt
kill themselves so to speak

  fools stubbs stormed all of
them dont they realize they are
doomed otherwise its kill or be killed
there is no mercy in the recessives
but surely there must be men in your
force who have no counterparts in the
rebel ranks

  there are graham admitted hope-
lessly thats how the trouble started
they had no compunctions about de-
stroying the recessives but the others
massed themselves around the disin-
tegrators there was a fight-a fight
among our own men his voice was
ashamed more than a score were
killed and all the while the rebels line
their trenches sneering openly at us
a tank man came forward determin-
the isotope men



edly saluted commander he said
ive just been talking with four of
my comrades theyre the only ones
without our-uh-other selves up there
suppose we sneak back to the tanks and
turn the rays on those trenches be-
fore the rest of the army knows what
happened well have blasted them out
of existence

  a splendid idea stubbs answered
warmly go back quietly so that your
purpose may not be observed before it
is too late

  the man saluted again and turned
to go as he did so he took a last look
upward his jaw dropped a muttered
exclamation burst through suddenly
clenched teeth

  what is it maxon stubbs de-
manded sharply

  maxon stammered something indis-
tinguishable and started hurriedly off
the scientist stared after him a moment
with frowning puzzled look then jerked
suddenly around as if he had been
hit

  ken whispered good lord to
bill were doomed all of us now
up on the hill a figure had emerged
from the bowels of the earth he stood
there silhouetted magnificendy against
the glitter of the slanting sun tall
arrogant angular a smile of fierce tri-
umph on his thin straight lips mal-
colm stubbs twin isotope to dictator
malcolm stubbs malcolm stubbs the
primitive personality freed from the
overlaying inhibitions of thousand of
years of weary evolution

  they stared at each other for long
moments these two once fused into a
single individual now separate and apart
tlirough the malefic forces of an im-
personal science moments of tremen-
dous drama instinct with the fate of
a world that hung in a trembling bal-
ance

  even the opposing armies had frozen
into rigid stillness as if they sensed also
the terrific struggle that pulled with in-

visible influence between them ken
saw the solution to his puzzle now the
frightful dilemma that confronted them
saw it now when it was too late

  too late not yet on the quick
racing feet of maxon depended more
than the outcome of a battle the doom
of a civilization of the human race
of the planet itself kept even pace with
him if only-

ix

  stubbs the recessive lifted his
arm spoke brother your subordinate
intends to kill me the integral part of
yourself who slept with you and ate
with you and thought with you order
him to stop

  the voice was stubbs the gesture
was indistinguishably his malcolm
stubbs started great globules of sweat
beaded on his high forehead his bleak
features twisted with strange anguish
he whirled saw maxon still running
almost at the smooth gray bulge of the
tank

  stop he shouted it is myself
you would murder

  but maxon did not stop he knew
what had happened knew that it was
their only chance he flung himself
desperately forward in a last burst of
speed clawing for the armored door

once inside-

  ken cried out sharply plunged head-
long for the scientist too late the
small weapon kicked in stubbs hand
there was a quick barking sound and
maxon seemed to stumble his arms
jerked wildly stiffening fingers slid
along the steel of the tank then he went
down in a huddled heap

  stubbs the recessive cried mock-
ingly good work brothers he
ripped out an order to his cohorts

  the trenches heaved and spewed out
men thousands and thousands poured
forth in endless flow guns held cannily
behind their backs steel tips of the bay-


astounding stories

onets gleaming wickedly in the reveal-
ing sun moving down the long slope
in slow steady unhurried march
stubbs marched at their head proudly
arrogantly his flaming eyes a strange
compound of secret hate and licking
triumph

  the superisotope trembled violently
strange yearnings swept his frame
racked him with unquenchable fires
that was he coming down the hill that
part of him which had been lost and
for which his being cried unceasingly
up there was completion fruition ces-
sation from vain longing

  a moan jerked from stiff lips the
gun dropped from nerveless fingers
stubbs dictator of the americas ran
up the hill crying sobbing stumbling
arms outstretched toward the man who
was himself

  as if it had been a signal the super-
isotopes followed their leader stream-
ing in a solid mass up the rocky ground
faces set in hypnotic strain calling aloud
upon their counterparts

  ken and bill stood rooted to the
ground watching with horrified eyes
never in all the long history of this
much-scarred planet had stranger sight
been witnessed by human eyes

  armies of men or what had once
been men dissociated into component
parts split into sundering personalities
alike in every physical detail fronting
each other moving closer and closer to-
ward a seeming union

  the dominants streamed in disor-
dered array eagerly tempestuously
stubbs in the van the recessives over-
whelming in force moved more slowly
in disciplined ranks guns discreetly hid
the counterparts in front those who
found no mirror images in the army of
the superisotopes unobtrusively in the
rear

  they met halfway dictator malcolm
stubbs cried aloud to the other mal-
colm stubbs he flung his arms wide
in eager gesture hurled himself for-

ward for a quivering embrace his fol-
lowers raced clamorously seeking them-
selves in the silent steady rows seek-
ing for strange union with that which
had been torn from them

  the rebel leader smiled a bleak
frozen smile like that which ken had
always known yet queerly unutterably
different his arms twisted forward
from behind his back in what seemed
an answering gesture of welcome ken
cried out ripped from his paralysis
bill cursed

  the bayonet was a sharp lanc-
ing flame in the sun deliberately un-
hurriedly it dipped down jabbed with
resistless force it caught the long
spare figure of the scientist in his stom-
ach it sank deep with an eager quiver
twisted sharply malcolm stubbs sank
with a blubbering scream to the ground
while malcolm stubbs set foot on his
prone form jerked out the dripping
steel

  it was the signal from behind
thousands of backs came bayoneted
rifles plunged in a frenzy of delirious
hate into the unsuspecting emotion-be-
clouded superisotopes the shrieks of
the dying mingled in bitter incense with
the wild howls of the more than frati-
cidal recessives

  in minutes the mountain slope was
a bloody frightful shambles the horde
poured upon and over the surprised
semi-armed rout of their counterparts
bayonets dipped and rose and dipped
again with frightful regularity the
supermen had no chance for their lives
here and there one broke loose from
the stupor of the strange longing that
had overwhelmed him fought bravely
and desperately for his life but they
were not many and soon they too
went down in the welter of twitching
limbs on and on the slaughter went
ruthless remorseless methodical while
malcolm stubbs watched with grinning
glutted hate
the isotope men



  bill turned to his friend with an ex-
pression of utter horror ken theyll
come for us next wed better get out
of here

  ken said despairingly theyll
catch us we dont know how to run
the tanks

  bills brows knit with resolve he
started forward

  here where are you going  ken
called after him

  for those atomic disintegrators
bill flashed over his shoulder at least
we can die trying

  wait ken cried excitedly ive
got an idea theyll see you up there
chop you down before you have a
chance but in the tanks there are
others maxon was trying to reach
them come on

  he whirled and ran hunched over
trying to make himself as inconspicuous
as possible bill stopped raced after
him behind the noise grew to tre-
mendous proportions the shrieks of
the dying grew fainter and fainter over-
whelmed in the sadistic howlings of the
victors

  just as kens fingers clutched at the
entrance door of the nearer tank a
mighty shout told that they had been
discovered a bullet spanged into the
metal flattened harmlessly another
and another

  but ken was already inside dragging
his breathless friend after him the
slide shut smoothly in the face of a
crashing torrent of steel-jacketed mis-
siles

  get to the controls and try to figure
out how it runs ken said rapidly
theyll be turning their heavy artillery
on us in a minute ill do what i can
with the disintegrator

  already through the view plate he
saw recessives detach themselves from
their fellows go racing back to the

trenches once there-

  ken flung himself desperately toward
the bank of buttons near the tiny funnel

opening there were many of them
and every second was precious he
stabbed at them one after the other
nothing happened bill was groaning
and cursing as he heaved at unfamiliar
controls trying to get the right com-
bination to start the tank

  the foremost of the recessives had
already jumped from sight into the
front trench round black muzzles
lifted slowly over the top swiveled to
focus on the immobile tank

  kens fingers stabbed again and again
failure stared back at him with mock-
ing roundness failure and imminent
annihilation the yawning artifices were
fixed now in another second grim de-
struction would hurtle straight for
them he punched with vicious despair
at an inconspicuous button a trifle to
one side

  then as the roar of the oncoming
shell smote kens ears with deafening
concussion something happened in
mid-air the screaming missile blanked
out of existence there was silence
grim terrible while ken clung in fasci-
nated horror to the view plate

  the mountainside had been obliter-
ated a huge swath sizzled through
the earth seared through the atmo-
sphere dead and dying and living and
atomic cannon and trenches whiffed
into a shimmering dance of hazy un-
related atoms

  where there had been thousands on
thousands where the recessives had
screamed their song of hate to a world
more civilized than they silence and
smoking desolation prevailed the
great experiment was over obliterated
in a welter of primeval lusts and pas-
sions

  ken drew a shaky hand over his eyes
it was hard to believe that that one
terrific blast of atomic destruction had
slain the last of the one-per-cent per-
sonalities the primitive natures whom
stubbs had released and who lor one


astounding stories

dreadful day had seemed to inherit the
earth

  bill jerked at a final lever cried tri-
umphantly ive got the hang of it
hold on  were going places

 the tank swung swiftly around
leveling out rocks and gullies with its
endless caterpillars raced smoothly
down the mountain back to civilization
back to a world incredibly freed from
the menace that had hung over it for
a night and a day

 the rest is history ken craig
knew now exactly what had happened
took the proper measures to eradicate
their consequences

  nature was agelessly wise in wed-
ding her isotopes together in indissevcr-
able compact he told bill as they went
hurtling over the smoking countryside
in our scientific arrogance we tam-
pered with forces beyond our knowl-
edge beyond our control he shud-
dered went on that handful of
heavier elements never alone now in
nature hold in their innermost atomic
recesses dreadful things it took the
tremendous preponderance of the
lighter isotopes to mask their evil qual-
ities to keep them submerged in the
average human being perhaps here is
the solution of the hitherto insoluble
mystery of the nature of good and evil
of their origin in a mingled universe of
chance and law

  perhaps even he speculated in
the far-off mists when the world was
very young and the internal fires still
blazed with incredible fury the isotopes
were not always associated perhaps
thus we can explain the tenacious race
legends the race memories of a golden
age of the pure and innocent and virtu-
ous and of devils and evil spirits and
foul monstrous things

  it was the vast common mass of hu-
manity to whom ken appealed on his
return the normal average men who
had clamored in vain for the dissociat-

ing baths and been refused while their
more talented fellows split into com-
ponent personalities

  they rose in a mighty throng trem-
bling at the disaster they had barely
escaped they hunted down the scat-
tered remnants of the recessives who
had escaped the holocaust on the moun-
tains killed them on sight they had
no mirror images to hold back their
arms to fill them with overpowering
longings

  the question of the surviving super-
isotopes was a much more difficult prob-
lem to handle there were almost
ninety thousand in existence and they
held the secret to weapons of incredible
efficiency

  but the problem solved itself the
seeds of destruction of futility were
inherent in them horty had given the
first hint when he had gone secretly to
the camp of the recessives seeking the
counterpart that had never come to life
it showed more strongly when stubbs
saw stubbs in the televisor it grew to
overwhelming intensity on that last
lelhal battlefield

  time was the catalyst the strange
inner longing grew fiercer with the pas-
sage of the days the rarer heavier
isotopes were inert self-sufficient but
the more common lighter ones seemed
unstable requiring union to achieve
quiescent solidity

  the superisotopes forgot their wis-
dom their intellectual achievements the
resistless might of their weapons in the
mad desire that now burned with un-
quenchable fire in their veins they
roamed the countryside with plaintive
looks seeking the beings who had been
wrested unnaturally from their whole-
ness seeking those who were destroyed
irrecoverably

  it was an easy matter for kens
armed bands to pick them up singly
place them in safe strong confinement
but he felt a vast pity at the sight of
their miserable wretched existence
the isotope men



with bills aid he evolved a powerful
localized anaesthetic which operated on
the intermediate neurone paths dulled
them into surcease from aching longing

  but with it went the vital spark of
genius all the remainder of their lives
they moved across the face of normal
humanity listless tired wanting in en-
ergy and daring a race of men apart
incomplete doomed to inevitable extinc-
tion

  ken and bill were faced with a task
of stupendous proportions now that
sudden catastrophe had been averted
the first thing they did was to decree
the destruction of every ionic-dispersion
tank every reintegrator the full proc-
ess had been known only to stubbs and
ken craig stubbs was dead and ken
held the secret close-locked in his bosom

  then there was the problem of re-
building the civilization of the americas
ken by unanimous acclaim was elected
administrator the brains of the na-
tion were dead or stupefied beyond re-
pair with the exception of ken and
bill maynard only the anonymous in-
coherent masses were left the leaders
were gone

  the two men worked mightily

schools were opened by the thousands
teachers inventors musicians authors
scientists philosophers were imported
wholesale from the rest of the world
lured by flattering offers hard-handed
mechanics toiled over the calculus
sought to penetrate the theory of what
they had practiced all their lives jazz
players learned the mysteries of coun-
terpoint and harmony ditch diggers be-
came engineers storekeepers tried des-
perately to grapple with the heights of
parnassus it was tedious and slow
but the work of the nation managed to
go on

  we must wait for the new genera-
tion to grow up ken told bill as the
latter groaned over the situation for-
tunately talent and genius rise just as
readily from the ranks of the average
as from the so-called aristocracy of in-
tellect and we are training them
training them as no new generation had
ever been before perhaps the whole
affair was a blessing in disguise it
focused our attention on certain funda-
mentals that will not soon be forgotten
it taught us the mysteries of our inner
beings showed us the limits beyond
which we must not go

night operator  otherwise
known as gordon milton m d
asked operator  as the two men were
driving through an icy jersey wind to
the hospital from the railroad station

  i think so replied operator  a
photographer sent to the hospital by the
mind research society new york
city as i understand it a meeting is
to take place this evening between you
and cooperator s etheric double

in this case you are merely the chosen material channel
for health what have you to fear

co-operator-


laboratory co-operator-



   im to shoot all that takes place in-
 cluding cooperator s etheric double
 when she projects it into the laboratory
 operator  who will arrive later will
 shoot the sound effects and voices and
 in cooperator s home in florida sim-
 ilar talking pictures will be taken and
 both sets will be sent to headquarters to
 be developed and compared

   operator  also will be here
   yes

   hes bringing his thought detector
equipped with a loud-speaker which he
invented according to cooperator s
findings

   and yours

   operator  furnished the electrical
 knowledge to materialize the idea gor-
 don continued after acknowledging
 with a smile operator s qualifying
 phrase the talkie instrument will re-
 cord cooperator s and my thoughts
 as they are transmitted through the new
 thought detector

   well here we are at the hospital
ill put you up in my room i think
youll be comfortable there until five
oclock when the laboratory will be
available for you to set up the equip-
ment by that time tbe other operators
should be here

  after showing operator  to his
room gordon made his afternoon visits

   as he drove through the late-after-
noon bitter cold he remembered his
first meeting with cooperator  how
he had sighed with relief one morning
about a year before upon receiving
from headquarters the telegram which
read

   operator three will
 cooperate with you
 nine a m january ninth

  that message marked the beginning
of a thrilling year for gordon

   he now recalled that two days after
receiving it the atmosphere of the oper-

ating room had been filled with quiet
activity while he thoroughly scrubbed
his person to perform a malignant goiter
operation

  upon reflection he again felt with
all its original agonies the sudden fear
which swept over him as nurse jensen
helped him that morning into fresh op-
erating coat rubber gloves and mask
that was his first operation of this na-
ture he felt he could not go on with
it that with his inexperience in this
particular line he was about to commit
murder

  jensen while helping him with the
thin rubber gloves cast him a worried
glance and now he supposed she had
noticed the tremor of his long slender
hands

  why did i undertake tliis alone
he had groaned within himself the
sweat poured out on his forehead jen-
sen wiped it off with a sterilized sponge

  suddenly gordon had sensed an
added presence in the room yet no door
had opened

  he knew cooperator  had arrived

  his eyes were drawn to the operating
table where the patient lay under the
effects of the anaesthetic small white
carts on rubber tired wheels and hold-
ing shining sterilized instruments glit-
tered in the rays from the great dome
light above the operating table white-
clad nurses moved about the room
quietly performing their respective du-
ties

  by the side of the anaesthesian stand-
ing near the patients head stood co-
operator  a young woman of about
gordons own age

  gordon detected a delicate perfume
of lavender above the pungent odor of
disinfectants filling the room

  so graceful and ethereal was this
womans bearing that gordon had felt
she should be giving her interpretation
of the dance of the virgin forest nymph
instead of assisting him to win his pa-
tients battle against a choking death


astounding stories

  warmth and rhythm were her key-
notes

  and yet she was so at home in the
midst of the cold atmosphere of glit-
tering knives and efficiency that gordon
pondered an instant on lifes incongrui-
ties

  then her large dark eyes riveted on
gordons penetrating blue ones re-
vealed life-giving powers

  in this case you are merely the
chosen material channel for health
they distinctly said what have you
to fear

  nothing was the scarcely audible
answer which escaped from gordons
throat jensen asked what he had said
gordon straightened his shoulders his
hands were steady then

  nothing he repeated aloud and
walked to the operating table his eyes
buried in those of cooperator 

  gordon now chuckled when he re-
membered how jensen had looked at the
spot where his eyes seemed glued he
had seen her out of the corner of his
eye evidently she saw no stranger nor
anything unusual because she shrugged
her shoulders and looked blank upon
reflection he supposed he had appeared
a bit queer

  then he remembered he had spent
the evening following the operation in
his office at the hospital making his re-
port to the mind research society

  and that as he wrote as a matter
of form the outstanding characteristic
of cooperator  large vital dark
eyes that talked he had been sure those
same eyes under personal and favorable
conditions could tell him other things
besides that he was merely an imper-
sonal life-saving device that they
were capable of saying humorous star-
tling intimate and wise things all at one
time even if their owner were approx-
imately only twenty-eight years of age

  upon its completion gordon reread
the report it included a minute de-
scription of cooperator  her dark-

blue wool dress clasped at the neck with
a large green velvet bow and belted with
green suede and the center part in her
blue-black waved hair that was drawn
into a small neat knot at the nape of
her slender neck

  even now a year later every detail
of that first picture of her vas indelibly
stamped upon his memory

  with some chagrin he remembered
his useless request please forward me
cooperator s name and address
which he had typed on a fresh sheet of
paper and attached to the report

  he remembered he had received
a letter from headquarters asking him to
confirm or deny the report that the sil-
ver belt buckle he wore while perform-
ing the goiter operation on january
ninth were engraved with the initials
g m

  he had confirmed it in a none too
docile mood now he wondered at his
sudden and unaccountable surge of an-
ger at operator ls refusal in that let-
ter to divulge cobperator s name and
whereabouts

  several days later he awakened in
the morning with the feeling that some-
thing interesting was to happen but
was too drowsy to remember just what
the excitement might be then he re-
membered another etheric double ex-
periment was to take place that eve-
ning how quickly he had come into
possession of his faculties

  damn it he remembered muttering
a few minutes later when he slashed
the skin above his upper lip while shav-
ing now i suppose shell report that
beauty mark she secs initials on cov-
ered belt buckles

  that evening the hospitals great
laboratory had been in semidarkness
how vividly he remembered that night
the glass test tubes and bottles of vari-
ous sizes and shapes stood in orderly
rows on their shelves and shone in the
reflection of the one powerful light that
laboratory co-operator-



illuminated a comparatively small corner
of the room under this light gordon
was working on a formula for a serum
for the prevention of goiter so sub-
merged was he in his work that he for-
got he was expecting cooperator 

  he lighted the bunsen burner stand-
ing at his elbow with a start he
dropped the lighted match to the floor
without extinguishing it

  a womans arm had passed through
the flame

  gordon steadied himself blinked his
eyes and stared into the shadows be-
yond the flame of the burner gradu-
ally the form of cooperator  became
visible

  ive been here a long time operator
 her eyes teased sorry to have
startled you but its high time you re-
membered our appointment

  terribly sorry murmured the
abashed gordon i-

  apology accepted

  damn it thought gordon as
he realized he must appear ridiculous
to his colleague

  he abruptly checked his thoughts he
knew she had tuned in on his unspoken
words but when he again looked at
her she was attempting to read the
notes he had been jotting down on the
piece of scrap paper before him with-
out comment he turned the paper so the
writing would be right side up to her

  all personal feeling had been lost
while she read his notes the surgeon
and the woman possessing eyes that
talked became impersonal channels for
scientific research for the benefit of the
human race they caught one anothers
thoughts more accurately than if words
had been spoken aloud they antici-
pated one anothers ideas they glided
down unexplored caves of medical dis-
coveries the serum compounded that
night was astoundingly simple

  it was one-thirty she was gone
he was spent physically alone in the

shadowy laboratory he slumped down
on a tall laboratory stool rested his
arms on the laboratory table and
dropped his head upon them he closed
his eyes in physical weariness yet his
brain was on fire it wished to go on
and on with her over uncharted seas
but his physical body was exhausted
completely gradually his conscious
mind came back to the material world
about him the man replaced the chan-
nel

   hereafter i shall lock myself in the
laboratory when i meet her he had
thought as he drew the bed covers over
him in his small hospital bedroom a
few minutes later any one seeing
me carry on an animated silent conver-
sation with atmosphere would think me
screwy

  he decided as he stopped the car for
the first red traffic light on the edge
of town that he must have dropped to
sleep with a humorous smile playing
around his mouth he remembered no
more of that night

  the red light changed to green as
gordon wove his car through the ever-
increasing traffic he recalled that the
following evening he had been on duty
for emergencies he sat at his desk
writing reports to headquarters of that
mornings operation and of the labora-
tory session with cooperator  the pre-
vious evening

  he was finding it a hard task he
must tell about cooperator s forearm
passing through the bunsen burner
flame and inquire if there were marks on
her arm that point must be checked
but for some unknown reason he dis-
liked relating the incident

  he wrote she had worn that night
a dark-blue sport dress with elbow-
length sleeves

  am i intruding questioned a
wordless voice

  startled gordon looked up he put
his thumb and index finger to his eyes
as if to wipe away a mist the word-


astounding stories

less voice went on its none other
than yours truly cooperator 

  gordon leaped from his chair his
hand outstretched to shake hands but
halted abruptly upon receiving the peti-
tion from her lovely eyes no not
that it would be so disappointing to
both of us to find i am only atmosphere
lets preserve the illusion please

  of course he agreed you
seemed so real i forgot myself please
sit down

  she did

  i suppose you are wondering why
this unannounced call she questioned

  im delighted no matter what the
cause

politely said cooperator  an-
swered brightly however no matter
what the reason this call is unethical
there are times when i damn pro-
fessional ethics

  i wished to explain something in this
mornings operation she said seriously
ignoring his pleasantry

  yes i wondered why you extended
the operating area as much as you did
i could see no infection that far

  i noticed your instants hesitation
and that is why im here infection
had started but was still invisible to
the naked eye up to the line i made
with the project electric ray i in-
tensified the ray when you hesitated
we dont want a return of the trouble
a dull-gray aura told the story i
wished you to make a clean job of it
and knew you had no way of seeing
what was still invisible

  i followed the ray only because i
had confidence in you i confess i was
disturbed at the time and havent been
able to forget it since

  i thought so and wished to assure
you the infection had spread farther
than you had reason to believe you
did a clean job operator 

  thanks for relieving my mind i
dislike cutting any more than is neces-
sary im rather a fanatic on that

  cooperator  rose to leave

  thanks ter coming gordon re-
peated and then with a twinkle in his
eyes he continued but how can you
get away from your husband in the eve-
nings unless its an emergency case

  i have no hnshand

  thats all i wasted to know
clever arent y in getting around
regulations against asking personal in-
formation of operators

  i told you i sometimes damned pro-
fessional ethics are you engaged or
anything

  no how about you

  free white and twenty-one he an-
swered

  no more personal questions and
if you have no more professional ones
to ask ill be going and i wont
weaken again

  weaken he teased

  yes weaken she smiled you
know as well as i do that all that takes
place between us is supposed to lie re-
ported by us separately to headquarters
some of our conversation to-night
would be a great aid to science good
night operator  and she started for
the door

  automatically gordon rose to escort
her out as he would any visitor but she
was gone as suddenly as she had ap-
peared how shocked and lost he had
felt at that magic disappearance

  he sank back into his chair had she
been in the room with him he won-
dered or had he imagined she had
even now a year later her visit seemed
like the memory of a delightful dream
the faint lavender perfume which was
a part of her lingered in his conscious-
ness

  a few days later gordon had learned
from headquarters that cooperator 
had reported a slight razor cut above
his upper lip the evening they had com-
pounded the antigoiter serum and that
a small red spot having the appearance
and sensation of a burn was found the

ast-
laboratory co-operator-



following morning on her left arm
above the wrist

  shes a wow of an operator gor-
don thought as he slapped on his brakes
upon entering the hospital garage he
had no more time for reminiscence he
had just time enough to eat and dress
before the long-anticipated experiment
of this evening was to take place in
which all operators of the society were
interested so keenly

  all set gordon inquired upon
entering the laboratory the guest op-
erators were making sure all was in
readiness

  everythings ready operator  re-
plied

  cigarette asked gordon some-
how i cant hand a thing to being in
the movies

  you look calm enough commented
operator  as for the cigarette no
thanks please go outside to smoke
this photographing of etheric doubles
is a ticklish enough business without
smoke in the room

  i dont need a smoke anyway gor-
don said as he tossed the unlighted ciga-
rette into a near-by wastebasket with
one hand and ran the fingers of the
other through his prematurely graying
hair its three minutes of eight shall
we start

  o k

  the three guest operators took their
places and opened the machines gor-
don walked to the laboratory table the
room was charged with suspense

  oh if this only works gordon
thought

  he was startled to hear his thought
voiced by the thought detector on the
other side of the room

  silence ladened the room gradually
a shadowy figure projected in cooper-
ator  was moving toward gordon her
visiting operators operating their vari-
ous machines could be distinguished in
the background of her own living room

 ast-

  how stunning the blue dinner
gown gordon thought again the
detector exposed his thought and he de-
cided to trick the blasted thing and think
no more private thoughts for the pres-
ent the decision was voiced ruth-
lessly

  what is taking her attention  gor-
don wondered the question was voiced
by the detector

  you have projected a dog as well
s yourself he exclaimed aloud as the
form of a pure-white police dog became
visible what a feat what nerve

  she paid him no heed she was
coaxing the nervous prancing animal
into quietness

  there fritz beautiful dog she
soothingly murmured aloud by means
of the thought detector be good just
a minute while we have our pictures
taken there now walk over to the
laboratory table you dont see the
table well never mind beautiful
steady beautiful steady just a few mo-
ments more there now thats a good
boy

  fritz quieted he stood at attention
with upright ears tail out looking his
mistress straight in the eyes for a
full half minute her eyes hypnotized
the animal so that  he did not move

  then his huge tail drooped between
his legs a wild look came into his eyes
he gave one bound out of the room and
let out a terrified yelp

  cooperator  faded out the thought
detector was silent

  the hospital laboratory was left in
shocked stillness gordon and operator
 stood stalk still as if frozen hor-
ror was written on their faces

  somethings gone wrong ex-
claimed operator  the detector in-
ventor

  the sound-and-movie operators
cranked on and on letting nothing in
the laboratory escape the eyes and ears
of the cameras they shot operator 
and gordon whose perplexed gasps and


astounding stories

frozen faces registered disappointment
and consternation

  the shock may have unbalanced
her groaned gordon oh lord
why did she try to bring that dog

  but look what it has done for sci-
ence exclaimed operator  the pur-
port of the accomplishment dawning
upon him

  shes too fine an operator to have
this happen gordon groaned

  the cameras stopped operator 
crossed the room and offered a cigarette
to gordon who took it with trembling
fingers and sank down on a high stool
near him brown smoke streamed from
his twitching nostrils the sudden col-
lapse of the projection had shocked his
own nerves

  in a silence heavy with disappoint-
ment and conjectures the men packed
the records and machines making ready
to leave on the midnight train

  after they had gone gordon sought
release from his worries in an attempt
to sleep no sleep relieved his agony
at two oclock in the morning he sent
a telegram to headquarters in new york
requesting an investigation of cooper-
ator 

  two days passed and gordon re-
ceived no word from headquarters

  in the early evening of the second
day he went into the laboratory hoping
cooperator  would project herself
there and let him know all was well
with her and that their work could con-
tinue as in the past

  he fumbled with this bottle and that
test tube nothing happened on a
superstitious sentiment he lighted the
bunsen burner no arm passed through
its flame he smoked one cigarette after
the other decided she was not coming
and went to visit a patient in the hos-
pital

  a message for you dr milton
said nurse jensen as gordon emerged
from the sick room

  thanks he mumbled as he fairly

snatched at the yellow envelope jen-
sen started down the corridor

  jensen gordon called please
call the airport and ask the time the
next plane leaves for tampa florida
check connections and make reserva-
tions for me ask dr turner to meet
me in my office as soon as possible
are you leaving doctor

 yes emergency case and he
strode down the corridor

 stewardess gordon asked
after being in the air a few minutes

  yes sir inquired the young
woman in uniform who stepped to his
side

  why dont we make some headway
were just crawling along

  this must be your first trip up sir
were making a hundred and fifty miles
an hour

  hundred and fifty

  yes sir since gordon relaxed
and seemed indisposed toward further
conversation she asked anything
else

  no thanks

  gordon retreated within himself

  he remembered the thought detector
with its privacy-intruding loud-speaker
he smiled to himself and was glad the
pesky thing was not on board the ship
the other passengers would have an
amusing trip if it were tuned in on
him that night upon reflection he was
not sure it had been a good thing to
help devise the odious thing man had
a right to some privacy

  then his thoughts returned to the
test of two nights ago he supposed it
had been a failure nothing planned
had taken place why had phyllis-he
liked the sound of the name he had
learned from the telegram-projected
that dog

  she should have known the nervous
system of a dog could not stand the
strain of such concentrated vibrations
and that a sudden break in her thoughts
laboratory co-operator-



during projection might prove too great
a shock for her own nerves to withstand
he admired her courage but not her
judgment and wasnt it just like a
woman to take things in her own hands
at a crucial moment regardless of con-
sequences 

  and now he thought the experiment
would have to be remade and before
it could be remade this time he hoped
in an orderly fashion cooperator 
would have to be made well he wished
the trip were over so he could go about
the business of restoring her to health

  he noticed that ice completely cov-
ered the planes windshield

  we must be flying blind he
thought and it must be terribly cold
outside he snuggled into his seat
more deeply thankful for the warmth
inside

  suppose phyllis had become unbal-
anced with the nerve strain of frequent
projections and this final shock had
broken her his trained mind rejected
the possibility constructive thoughts
were this medical mans creed

  will we be on time gordon ques-
tioned the stewardess as she served him
coffee at five oclock in the morning

  yes sir

  only two hours more he thought
as he asked do you know how far
it is from the tampa airport to davis
islands 

  we land at the new airport on the
islands

  how large are the islands

  from the airport to anywhere on
the island is no more than a ten min-
ute ride

  thank you gordon said and the
stewardess moved on to serve the next
passenger

 gordon stepped into tampas
dime cab upon alighting from the plane

  during the six minute ride to his pa-
tients home even the thought of his
mission was usurped by the glories of

a florida early morning the singing
of the birds could be heard above the
motors hum the blooming hibiscus
oleander brazilian pepper and other
semitropical bushes lent an atmosphere
of fairyland to the brightly colored
homes of spanish architecture lining
both sides of expansive davis boule-
vard

  the sky is so blue thought gor-
don as he glimpsed a portion of hills-
boro bay when the cab rounded a cor-
ner  he marveled at the blueness of the
water and the grace of the ducks rest-
ing in it after their long flight from
colder climates

  all the beauties of nature were for-
gotten dr milton was pressing the
doorbell of the green stucco spanish
bungalow in which cooperator  lived

  dr milton i presume inquired
the friendly voice belonging to the
young man who answered gordons
ring

  yes

  come in please the young man
said while opening the screen door

  the younger man proffered his hand
and volunteered  dan farringtons my
name phyllis brother

  gordon set down his traveling bag
in order to shake hands with dan

  let me have your coat it looks like
a mighty heavy one for this part of the
country

  and feels more like one gordon
answered politely even though he real-
ized that neither he nor the man before
him at that moment cared a mite about
the weight of his overcoat its reg-
ular summer here its hard to realize
theres ice and snow up in my part of
the country now tell me about phyllis
-miss farrington

  there isnt much to tell young
farrington began some men came
down from new york to perform some
sort of experiment fritz here took
some part in it

  gordon looked at the growling huge


astounding stories

white police dog standing beside dan
and recognized him to be the one phyllis
had projected three night ago

  the dog became frightened dan
continued and ran out of the room
with a yelp phyllis lost consciousness
and fell to the floor

  the operators as phyllis calls them
warned her not to use the dog but just
like her she said she was willing to
take the chance phyllis revels in the
unusual she always does the unex-
pected 

  she didnt come to for sixteen hours
despite medical help since then every
time she has regained consciousness she
has asked for you thinking you would
understand her case better than the lo-
cal physicians meanwhile a telegram
which dad opened came to phyllis from
headquarters asking if there had been
trouble with the experiment and
through the sender of this message we
located you

  any fever

  hovers between a hundred and two
and a hundred and three and a half
doctor cant get it down then he
added youll find her in the first
bedroom to the left of that long hall
the family isnt up yet the nurse is
about somewhere if youll excuse me
ill give fritz his mornings run

  no one was about

  gordon walked down the hallway
dan had designated quietly opened the
door of phyllis room and closed it be-
hind him

  there on the bed lay the real
phyllis her worried flushed yet too
white face instantly caught gordons
professional eye her blue-black hair
shone in the sunlight coming through
the tilted venetian blinds and made a
sharp contrast on the rumpled white
pillow

  she was vital even in her illness

  she was so like the phantom cooper-
ator  that it was difficult for gordon

to believe he was occupying the same
room with her

  he was aware of the familiar faint
scent of lavender pervading the room

  conflicting emotions suddenly surged
up and warred within him simultane-
ously he longed to crush her to him and
to soothe her as he would a tired child
why he had been in love with her for
a long long time

  first of all he was a physician so
he leaned against the door for support
in a struggle for composure this sud-
den awakening was staggering he
was all choked up yet an onlooker
would have seen only a poised tall
definitely professional youngish man
with prematurely graying hair whose
blue eyes and slightly quivering nostrils
told the story of his love for the sleep-
ing woman lying on the bed

  phyllis deep dark eyes opened and
peeped over the lavender and yellow
handmade patchwork quilt spread over
her

  i won they sighed and closed
again

  speechless gordon strode across the
room and seated himself on the side of
the bed his arms gently stole around
her fevered shoulders what a fool
hed been not to know before and
she felt the same way

  time and space were no more

  presently a woman cleared her
throat in the background

  gordon looked around but phyllis
made no move she was in a fevered
sleep

  gordon stood up a starched nurse
was in the room

  sorry she said

  im dr milton gordon managed
to explain

  we were expecting you doctor i
heard you come in an hour ago mr
and mrs farrington are having break-
fast and have asked you to join them

   id rather not ill stay here a while
laboratory co-operator-



longer he was still too unnerved to
wish to meet strangers

  gordon sat down in the low slippper
v hair standing beside the bed he took
phyllis hand in his for another hour
iiv sat looking steadfastly at her her
fever dropped to normal the pulse
gordon held in his hand also became
normal the fretted look that had
haunted him upon his arrival gradually
disappeared from her face her ex-
pression was one of triumph

  darling the test was a success
stated gordon with as much calm as he
could muster when he walked into phyl-
lis room that afternoon holding a
telegram in his hand both sets of
records and pictures dovetailed ex-
actly 

  then i didnt spoil everything

  on the contrary he said as he sat
on the edge of the bed you have
proved to the skeptics that human mind
power can project instantaneously ones
etheric double and even that of a dumb
animal not in harmony with the idea
to a given point a thousand miles dis-
tant

  since that is possible just imagine
the further possibilities there are face-
to-face conferences can be held with
the participants remaining in their own
cities in different parts of the country
providing each group involved had ac-
cess to one capable operator at the time
of the meeting thus to one more de-
gree overcoming time and space

  then the thought detector proves
to the laymen that thoughts reach the
person and place to which they are sent
and are established in their aurre and
therefore are bound to penetrate the
persons consciousness in a quiet un-
preoccupied moment

  gordon i did it on purpose phyllis
con lessee

  i dont get you

  stupid dear i projected fritz on a
gamble that it would bring you to me
i knew what probably would happen
you mean you wanted me that
much but suppose it had wrecked
your reason gordon shuddered at the
thought

  but it didnt-and i won

  gordon leaned down and kissed her
the local nerve specialist in attend-
ance found them in this position when
he entered the room without knocking
he was followed by the nurse and the
dog fritz the latter had been wait-
ing in the hall for hours with the hope
that some one carelessly would leave a
crack in the door or fail to say go
back fritz upon entering his mis-
tresss room

  dr andrew dr milton said
phyllis

 dr milton announced the elder
physician after giving his patient one
all-seeing glance i turn this case over
to you ive struggled unsuccessfully
for days to help miss farrington and
look what youve done for her in a few
hours the case is yours there was
a twinkle in his old wise eyes when he
asked what course of treatment do
you propose

  i suggest a quiet wedding a week
from to-day gordon answered join-
ing into the elder mans mood

  to you  suppose interrupted dr
andrew

  certainly then a quiet cruise to
south america and back here topped
off with an airplane flight to the cold
jersey coast to establish residence there
and no more research work for her for
one year

  best treatment i know for brain-
and-nerve fatigue that is if the pa-
tient is willing

  it sounds heavenly to me phyllis
beamed

up to now

to ranee driggs forestry num
magic seems to have descended on black
mountain but driggs is a man trained
in science as well as forestry and to
him magic is just something not yet un-
derstood

but bare footprints then the marks
of hideous three-toed feet on black
mountain and a blue star falling stop-
ping then moving swiftly from sight
 fozan clung to the animals back as the big jaw gripped the first
 of the guards and another went down beneath trampling feet

make him wonder anti katharine-
kitten-putnam sees a figure of
blotchy green among the trees

  driggs finds a nearly naked bronze-
skinned man on the trail just as a rattle-
snake has struck him driggs saves
him but is knocked unconscious by a
green-fleshed man with a ray of
light

  katharine reznves him and finds
among marks of ugly three-toed feet
a locket with a blue jewel driggs

looking into it sees a beautiful woman
and seems to hear her say who holds
the blue jexvel of dra vonga must come
when dra vonga calls

  then tabletop mountain vanishes in
a whirl of invisibility and the same
mysterious quivering veils driggs clear-
ing for an instant but in that instant
his home is destroyed and again are
found nutrks of the same hideous
feet

  but now katharine has taken the


astounding stories

jewel and driggs learns that she is be-
ing drawn in a hypnotic trance to table-
top he goes there only to see her
vanish in the zone of invisibility and
plunges in himself inside the zone is
a huge ship from which pours a horde
of green-fleshed man-things

  driggs and katharine are captured
and taken to xandros a satellite of
jupiter known as grokara there dra
vonga attracted to driggs causes
katharine to disappear in tluit same
whirl of invisibility but driggs secures
a promise that the girls life will be
spared

  fosan a native of xandros and the
one whom driggs smed on black
mountain trail takes driggs to see
du-vor the one who flies driggs
finds duvaurier a frenchman with one
withered arm who has journeyed to
xandros in a space ship of his own in-
venting

  he has been a captive of dra vonga
for over a hundred earth years of time
yet it appears that only a year has actu-
ally elapsed he tells driggs that dra
vonga is master of time and that on
xandros time runs fast although it
seems to pass at normal speed

  duvaurier is building a fleet of space
ships for dra vonga who has told
driggs that together they will rule the
earth she has new weapons and new
transports and her secret of invisibility
through control of time makes the men-
ace very real

  duvauricrs withered arm is the re-
sult of punishment in the cold flames
in a hidden room beneath dra vongas
temple where great machines are at
work and driggs at mention of that
room knows that that is where katha
rine putnam is held prisoner

  and though duvaurier begs him not
to driggs leaves to go to the girls aid
his giant green-fleshed guard follows
him closely as he goes

xii

the ships and the throngs of
workers were behind him but
driggs did not head directly for
the distant dome he bore off instead
to one side

  qose on his trail so close that he
heard the giants coughing breath at
every step came the green guard and
from above an unmoving sun lighting
an endless day shone down on the ugly
green figure whose muscles bunched and
pulled and grew long again in plain
sight beneath his transparent skin

  where the forest began the green
wall was in endless motion leaves
opened and closed or jerked back as
living vines writhed and sent their
blunt sightless heads probing about

  giant flowers were crimson chalices
filled with fragrant liquids and a vine
finding one of these open thrust its
head in as driggs watched the crim-
son blossom struggled in vain driggs
could even hear the sucking sound as
opened pores in the head drew in the
fluid the bloom faded to pale-pink
and wilted down then the vine with-
drew its head and again took up its
endless search

  driggs had to force himself to lay
hands on one of the things and yet a
half-formed plan made this essential
he caught a vine that was looped across
his path and drew it aside the tiling
twisted within his hand and strove to
get free it was pulling upward and
it almost lifted him from his feet be-
fore he let go then the vine lashed
fifty feet in the air and driggs watched
it go with thoughtful eyes after that
he passed through the living wall of
green and into the forest

  there was no path and the tree
trunks like polished ebony were
crowded close for a few steps the
green giant was at driggs heels then
he could go no farther from his lips
came strange barking sounds and he
blue magic



whipped a white metal tube from the
cloth at his waist he aimed this at
driggs then pointed back toward the
forests edge

  driggs looked at him coldly but said
maybe youre right about that and
turned and retraced his steps

  the green guard stood still and fum-
bled with the folds of cloth while he
put the weapon away driggs walked
fast

  he was almost out of the forest when
a blunt searching head crossed before
him-another vine like a writhing ser-
pent was seeking food this one was
black with red veins running length-
wise driggs caught it back of the head
and drew it after him as he hurried on

   it writhed in his clutching fingers and
pullfd backward toward the trees he
felt the throb of sentient life in the
thing as he tugged forward on it the
green giant was hurrying to catch up
and suddenly driggs opened his hand
the vine shot back and driggs fol-
lowed it with almost the same speed

  the green guard dodged but the
heavy rounded head of the vine was
swinging full at his face he jerked
his bare pointed head down and side-
ways and threw up both hands to ward
oit the blow here was the moment
driggs had planned for he leaped in

  he landed close to the green figure
the pointed headwas drawn down and
bent to one side it was within reach
driggs took only an instant to set him-
self then sent a crashing right flush
to the green jaw

  the big green lxdy dropped almost
soundlessly to the soft earth and lay
still and in equal silence but with
breathless haste driggs fumbled in the
folds of the mans waistcloth until his
hands found the metal tube he pulled
it out then he stood up and looked
at it

  the bulb on the end of the tube was
made for a bigger hand than his but
he could hold it and reach a lever on

the side he aimed the tube at the
green head on the ground before him
and pressed the lever for an instant

  light made a thin line then driggs
released the trigger and dropped the
tube into his pocket after that he
pushed out almost into the open and
turned and ran

  he skirted the field keeping always
in the shelter of the outer foliage he
stopped at times when he came to path-
ways through the forest where men of
fozans race passed bearing materials
for the ships then he crossed the
pathways unobserved and went on until
he struck through the forest toward that
distant opalescent dome

  there was no sign of life on
the broad plaza surrounding the outer
of the three circular buildings he did
not try to go back through the passage
that fozans father had used for he
had seen guards near the exit when
they passed out instead he ran si-
lently across the plaza and stood before
the big doors where he and katharine
had stood before they swung inward
at the first touch of his shadow

  here was a place of horror that
needed no guard-driggs knew well
enough what this meant he paused
for only an instant then passed inside
and saw the big doors swing shut

  all was darkness in the big circular
tunnel and no light formed this time
to lead the way which meant that
the other time their approach had been
guided by dra vonga she had oper-
ated mechanism to create that light she
had sent her laughter rippling over an
invisible beam but now driggs ran
blunderingly through the dark

  the cross passageways gleamed with
purple light-the tunnels through the
water were as they had been before
driggs was in the last circular coil when
he saw the beginning of light in the
coil itself

  it came in the windings about the


astounding stories

big tube it was a yellow glowing that
changed to a pale-green and with
the first coming of the green light the
air in the tunnel shot forward with tor-
nado force

  it sent driggs sprawling to the floor
he rolled over and over then his body
turned lengthwise of the tube and slid
at frightful speed as the pull of the
solenoid and the hurricane of wind
swept him on

  at last he crashed against a solid
wall and lay battered and breathless
looking above him at a vent out of
which the air rushed but at one side
was the purple passage to the inner
shrine-the temple of dra vonga

  he dragged himself toward the pas-
sage while the wind battered against
him and held him almost immovable
against the end wall but at last he
fell into the cool purple light and ahead
of him was not darkness as had been
the case before but the soft opalescent
glowing of the dome above the throne
room of the ruler of the xandrian
globe

  it was a matter of minutes only until
he stood on the platform where katha-
rine had been he counted the arch-
ways then ran swiftly but soundlessly
to the third arch

  darkness lay beyond and out of the
darkness came sounds the soft whir
of generators turning at high speed a
recurrent sighing and a shrill tremu-
lousness above the range of sound that
caught driggs nerves and set them
vibrating in sympathy and other sounds
less easily identified the torture of
that soundless quiver was beyond bear-
ing

  but down there somewhere duvau-
rier had seen machines and haa felt
cold torturing flames the green light
in the tunnel meant that the big coils
were in operation and now in that
place of abomination katharine put-
nam was a captive

  he knew it suddenly with sure cer-

tainty and he flung himself forward
into the dark for three strides he felt
the floor beneath him then that ended
he pitched forward then blue light
streamed upward from below and
played upon him as he fell

xiii

  the light was like a fountain
of water it buoyed him up the solid
thrust of it came up from beneath and
held him but after a moment the
fountain sank and lowered him gently
to the hard surface of a floor

  the fountain of light splashing about
him had cut off his view he had seen
nothing now all that was gone and
he scrambled to his feet and turned
right then left trying to see every-
where at once

  he was in a room-a place filled with
machinery twenty feet above him the
ceiling reflected a ghastly green light
the light came from some distant
source but it flooded across under that
ceiling and poured down upon the pol-
ished metal and glass of great machines
and set them to glittering

  dynamos whirled and made steady
green lines of light strange devices
with big gleaming balls of metal above
them reflected from a thousand curves
and here and there great quartz tubes
held light of their own-wavering
violet light that played incessantly

  yet all this meant nothing driggs
was looking for the girl and nothing
else mattered

  he ran one hand into his pocket and
gripped the bulb end of his weapon he
did not even know what the weapon
was but it was a ray projector of some
sort and he knew how that ray had
torn at his brain he pulled the weapon
from his pocket and held it in his hand
then stepped silently forward

  sound had filled the room as wel
as light that humming whir that he
had heard before came from the dy-
clue magic



namos and off at the right a purple
light imprisoned in a spiral of glass
grew from a mere pin point to a big
glowing mass then died away and
sighed with an almost human breath
each time that it waned and over all
was a sound driggs could not identify
-a weird ghostly singing like night
wind in the shrouds of a ship-a wind
that blew without ceasing

  but these were noises only of the
machines and his ears were straining
to hear other sounds-voices-katha-
rine putnams voice yet it seemed he
was alone until pat-patting through
these other noises was the sound of
bare feet running on stone

  from among the machines something
darted forward and stopped by the
spiral of glass and the green light
came down from above and threw its
ghastly glow over what seemed the liv-
ing mummy of a man

  this was something that lived yet
had no right to be among the liinf 
something-driggs knew this suddenly
-whose whole body had been blasted as
duvauriers hand had been

  the man stood in front of the purple
light and watched it as it grew and
faded and gradually grew again he
swung his withered shriveled body
from side to side in time with the light
and his skin creased stiffly like old
brown parchment

  abruptly his swaying motion ended
and he threw himself upon the floor
then rolled over and over shrieking with
laughter driggs got one look at his
shrunken face and knew the mans rea-
son was gone

  the laughter ceased abruptly as the
sunken eyes stared at driggs then
with a wild flinging of arms and legs
the brown naked thing came to its feet
and darted back among the machines
while his voice rose in a shrill scream
of fear

  lie ran toward the source of the
green light and his screams stopped

not far away then other sounds came
a woman spoke sharply and a deeper
voice barked sounds such as the green
men used

 the first voice was not
katharine putnams it might have
been dra vongas-driggs could not be
sure but the sounds were near he
slipped his weapon beneath his khaki
ct but kept his hands on the firing
lever then he ran where the withered
man had gone

  a battery of cylinders with funnel-
shaped tops reached away in a curved
line above each was a black disk in
the ceiling and driggs knew even
while he was straining to throw him-
self forward that here were the gen-
erators of the blue flames he had seen
in the temple room above

  the cylinders blocked off the view of
what lay beyond but light ghastly
green came from something back there
and a barking shout sounded loud
then suddenly a girls voice cried out
it was katharine putnam and the
sound checked driggs for one instant

  no she said i will never con-
sent

  driggs did not mean to call out he
meant to rush in silently but one cry
was wrung from him kitten he
called and heard her reply

  ranee a piercing cry and again
ranee

  then driggs ran swiftly past the bat-
tery of gleaming machines-on to
where a green flame blazed

  the green light blinded him only for
an instant then he saw figures dra
vonga standing-and the green light
sallowed her skin and made her dark
eyes look haggard draining even dra
vonga of her beauty she was wear-
ing a robe of some soft dark material
that hung in graceful folds

  beside her was a pedestal that ended
in a flat top a metal arm arched above


astounding stories

and held a single brilliant point of white
light above the pedestal top

  arkos stood near and he took one
step toward driggs before dra vonga
said no and stopped him

  the withered man was crouched on
the floor at dra vongas feet

  but driggs was darting wild glances
about he called once kitten then
he saw her locked in a whirl of flame

  green flames here was the source
of light that flooded the room but
no they were blue but they whirled
around a central core of yellow light
that projected above the blue and
reached in a round bar of yellow to the
ceiling

  singing flames for the weird wail-
ing song he had heard came from them

  the blue flames whirled at blinding
speed and sang as they whirled until
they fused together and made a cylin-
der of light and the yellow inner core
merged with it in green spectral glow-
ing a blue whirling wall and inside
the blue flame in the golden central
core katharine putnam was standing

  she was looking directly at him star-
ing through the whirl of flame and the
glow of it merged with the red of her
dress to make it seem black and leave
her face whiter by contrast she said
nothing but looked at driggs from
wide horror-filled eyes until he moved
toward her then she called out
dont she cried dont touch it
ranee the flame-

  she stopped and again stood staring
the cylinder-driggs knew it now for
the first time-was shrinking drawing
in closer and closer to the slender figure
inside

  as if from some terrible distance he
heard dra vonga laughing-soft
throaty laughter then she was speak-
ing

  see ranee driggs this little brown
man beside me once-he was tall and
fair but the blue flame struck him and

made him so soon this kitten will
no longer attract you

  driggs turned and whipped the
white weapon from beneath his coat it
glinted with deadly menace under the
green light he aimed it first at dra
vonga then at arkos then swung it
back again

  turn it off he said quick
quick i say

  dra vonga was not ten feet away
arkos was a little nearer because of
that one move he had made they stood
perfectly still and something in driggs
cold eyes checked even the trembling of
the brown withered thing at dra von-
gas feet

  dra vonga spoke first she said
you dare to threaten me and after
that she made sounds such as the green
ones used and the sounds sent arkos
forward in one giant leap

  driggs caught him in mid-air with
his weapon then sprang aside to let the
big green body crash to the floor arkos
lay still

  driggs swung the weapon again on
dra vonga he said im learning
some of your tricks you havent got
me on the black spot now you cant
slow me up turn it off i say ill
count three

  dra vonga laughed then easily con-
fidently she reached out with one
hand and brought it under the little
point of white light so that the shadow
of her hand fell on the plate beneath
the deadly menace of the green light
persisted but the song of the flames
changed to a lower droning note

  from back of him katharine put-
nams voice said its moved away
from me ranee the circle is bigger
now its holding still

  dra vonga let her hand fall to her
side no one but dra vonga she
said knows the secret of this only
dra vongas hand can change the
flame
blue magic



  again she laughed softly as she
looked at driggs destroy dra
vonga she said end kitten is still
locked in the light but it is only light
ranee driggs-light and a few other
radiations that my brilliant father dra
tor discovered kitten has only to
step through the light to be at your
side but when she has done that she
will be like this little withered one
here

  she bent down and her hand so
gracefully formed rested tor a moment
on the horrible parchmentlike skin of
the mummied man and driggs look-
ing at him remembered duvauriers
withered arm which had also felt the
touch of the blue flame kitten would
be like that

  his hand with the little white metal
ray projector dropped to his side he
said bitterly the word of dra vonga

then-

  -is the word of dra vonga she
said for see the blue flames do not
kill which is what dra vonga agreed
there was a childlike complacency
that was baffling an artless child an
alluring seductive woman a fiend in
that same beautiful body-dra vonga
seemed all three

  on the floor at driggs side the big
green-fleshed figure of arkos jerked
spasmodically the bulb of a ray pro-
jector showed in the folds of his loin
cloth driggs bent and reached for it
then saw blue metal beside it when
he straightened he had arkos weapon
but he had also his own 

  and though he knew it was foolish
the feel of it in his hand gave him new
courage

  he snapped it open with a jerk of
the wrist throwing the cylinder out
sideways there were three dented
shells the hammer had fallen on these
back on tabletop but there were two
cartridges left he pushed the cylinder
back carefully and turned it to bring

one of the cartridges under the hammer
on the first pull

  arkos on the floor was looking up at
him from narrow slanting eyes driggs
motioned with his gun get up he
said get over there beside her

  and a moment later he told dra
vonga all right you didnt kill her
you kept your word and this little ray
gun doesnt kill either but heres one
that does

  he swung the muzzle of the  from
dra vonga to arkos and back when
this kills them he said they stay
killed

  faced with new magic dra vonga
flinched her eyes grew big and she
raised one hand between her and the
blued steel she cried out no no
not the thunder death dra vonga will
not harm kitten it is a promise it
is the word of dra vonga

  driggs said turn it off and
moved the gun a fraction of an inch
higher

  dra vongas slim hand flashed out
again beneath the little point of light
so close that it shadowed the whole
pedestal top

  driggs half turned he was water-
ing dra vonga yet he could see the
whirl of flame he was watching it
as the blue flame vanished

  only the yellow glow at the center
remained and made a column of light
from floor to ceiling and from the
heart of it katharine putnam stepped
out and walked unsteadily to his side
and stood swaying for a moment

  driggs took his gun quickly in his
left hand and put his right arm about
her to steady her

  dra vonga was looking at katharine
and a little puzzled frown creased her
forehead she said slowly the
woman of earth is not as beautiful as
dra vonga i do not understand but
she seemed speaking to no one in par-
ticular

  from the floor at her feet the with-


astounding stories

ered thing that once had been a man
got to his feet and stood crouching then
ran to hiding beyond the glittering ma-
chines

  arkos made guttural growling
sounds but dra vonga silenced him
with one curt word in his own tongue
she brought her hand again beneath
the little point of light and moved it
and over where the yellow columns still
stood blue flames again took up their
whirl and the room was filled once
more with a spectral glow

   then the yellow light blinked out
and only the clear blue remained the
blue flames sang in a quavering high-
pitched note that climbed up and up un-
til it was above the range of sound and
was only a shrill tremulousness that
rasped driggs nerves

   his arm tightened around the girl
then he backed slowly away he held
the gun steadily on dra vonga and
arkos he half expected an attack
from some new source but none came

   dra vonga stood silent and unmov-
ing the expression on her face as
they went was entirely inscrutable

  the fountain of light that had
lowered driggs into the room buoyed
them up although now the fountain
could not be seen only the blue light
from farther back in the room flooded
along the ceiling and dimly illuminated
the upper passage that led to the big
room

  the fountain was holding them
steadily at the upper level and a metal
grip in the wall was within reach
driggs drew the girl and himself out
into the passageway

   darkness surrounded them but he
knew the way and he held her and took
her with him as fast as he dared go

   he felt the wood of the platform be-
 neath his feet and heard his boots tread-
 ing on it hollowly but still he was in
 utter darkness he gripped his gun
 and listened but there was no sound

   staring into the blackness he whis-
pered another cute little trick but
come on i can find the way well go
straight out-take a chance on the
guards-get outside

  he was feeling his way across the
empty echoing room and he struck the
arch at the exit squarely here was
where fozans father had led him
driggs felt his way quickly out into the
passage

   this passage should have been short
there should have been three of them
alternated with bridges but instead
driggs with katharine clinging to his
hand groped on and on through dark-
ness until his reaching hand touched a
last archway and found no wall be-
yond

   he extended one foot and knew that
steps were ahead-steps leading down
and suddenly he understood then he
gripped the girls hand and pulled her
close to him while he swung his gun
right and left in the darkness

   in a breathless whisper katharine
asked is it night ranee

   driggs lips were stiff and he spoke
with difficulty

   its broad daylight he said and
his voice shook the plazas out there
right ahead of us i can feel the sun
on my face were blind kitten-
blinded by that damned light

  then coming out of the darkness-
from the passage behind them and from
the steps ahead-was the soft scuffing
of bare feet on stone and somewhere
dra vonga laughed

xiv

  he stood alone and utterly
helpless only a few minutes later
katharine was gone torn from his
arms only a piece of cloth remained
in his clutching hands his gun was
gone too-one numbing blow on his
arm had done that

  he had been helpless once he had
blue magic



sprung toward the sound of a barking
voice but his hand found nothing and
his feet went out from under him he
had pitched forward rolling down three
of the steps before he stopped

  now he was standing erect listening
but there was no sound his eyes were
wide open and he felt the sunlight
warm on his face but he was staring
into black darkness

  he went down from step to step feel-
ing his way and moved out across the
broad plaza back of him was sound
now-the faintest whisper of calloused
feet on the stone by which driggs knew
that new guards had been assigned him

  a third scuffing sound came toward
him from one side and arkos unmis-
takable voice barked orders to the
guards driggs stopped and stood still
locating the sound then turned and
charged back in a mad rush

  his arms swung out in front of him
one of his hands touched smooth skin
he gripped at it-then argos fist
heavy as a club struck him awkwardly
on the side of his head and he went
down

  arkos scuffed away then and after
a time driggs got to his feet and moved
on he was weary of this task of
searching through the dark but at last
he heard duvauriers voice

  duvaurier came to him across the
plaza and the sound of duvauriers two
guards scuff-scuffing on the stone came
after

  duvaurier said ah mon ami it is
as i feared you looked upon the blue
light when it blazed alone-yet you
live and that is much come she per-
mits that you stay with me until the
blindness passes

  driggs had slept he had even
eaten-thick syrupy food and the
blindness was gone

  he was in duvauriers workshop the
long low building on the red rock plain
where the ships stood he walked rest-

lessly back and forth while duvaurier
sitting on a low bench watched him

  duvaurier said all is not lost
to have youth and courage-that is
great but for me i think i have lost
both of those else how could  build
these ships for her when i know what
she plans

  driggs stopped his walking maybe
well put a crimp in those plans he
said

  thus speaks youth and courage
duvauriers eyes were sad i he
said dare not hope i only build ships
-for her

  driggs picked up a little sheet of the
coppery metal thin as paper and laid
it down again and stood looking at it
without seeing he said slowly that

is nothing listen-

  she has taken kitten she has
promised not to harm her but we know
what she would have done this last time
-and i dont trust her now the devil
in her has shown itself too plainly and
im no child to be fooled by her but
duvaurier i tell you ive never seen
her yet that she didnt attract me i

know what she is and still i-

  he stopped and stood staring down
duvaurier drew a long breath and let
it out again slowly his voice came
across to driggs very low

  does any one know what she is-
devil or angel-or both-which is to
say a woman  but i think mon ami
that she could shake the steadfastness

of the saints when she looks at one-

  duvaurier too left his words hang-
ing in air he sat staring down at the
floor then he moved his withered arm
forward and looked at that and passed
his good hand across his forehead
wearily

  he said woman or devil but-
may heaven forgive i have built the
ships for love of her

  then he got up and did not look at
driggs again but walked out into the
sun


astounding stories

  four of the big ships were done the
fifth was only a huge wooden form with
scaffolding all around men stood on
the scaffolds and spread coppery liquid
over the wooden form in a thick coat-
ing and let it dry then they smoothed
it out as if it were plaster and after that
others polished it till it shone like buffed
copper

  driggs walked up to where duvaurier
was standing and stood at his side
watching the men he said thats a
good trick too duvaurier how did
you get on to it

  duvaurier shrugged dra tor did
it all of dra vongas magic dra tor
did but he meant it only for good
dra tor was her father

  yes he died shortly after i landed
then things changed fozans father
was king and fozan was heir to the
throne but royalty meant little to these
simple people dra tor had carried on
his research in secret and she took it
over

  driggs said the ship that brought
us over was gray not copper-colored
another metal duvaurier ex-
plained but applied in the same way
i do not know the secret again it had
to do with vibration inducing a change
of phase

  but the walls are thin driggs ob-
jected why didnt we freeze to death
out there 

  now duvauriers face beamed ah
but that is mine come he took
driggs by the arm and hurried him
across to where the little ship stood-
the little ship whose steel plates lapped
over and riveted were red with rust

  green guards followed them and one
of them sprang forward and barred the
round porthole that was the only en-
trance to the ship duvaurier turned
and walked away

  since i brought the last load of these
green ones from grokara i have not
been in my little ship he said but

the big ones are the same i will show

you

  driggs stopped suddenly and stood
perfectly still he laid a hand on du-
vauriers shoulder do you mean he
asked that the litde ship is in work-
ing order

  duvaurier glanced at him sharply
then looked away he said very low
yes but put the thought from your
mind msieu the green ones are al-
ways here

  inside one of the other big hulls
duvaurier pointed to the walls thin
he said but with a mirror polish
driggs nodded check he said
but go 

  there is nothing cold in space
msieu driggs there is only space
that is to say an object in space which
lias heat of its own cannot lose that
heat by contact for it contacts nothing
then if you also prevent it from losing
heat by radiation it stays the same tem-
perature nest-ce pas

  driggs said the mirror finish-and
theyre using the same things in houses
now but great heavens man to gam-
ble your life on that

  also on this duvaurier said and
again i won

  he was pointing now to the big cen-
tral truss that driggs had seen before
and to the thing mounted in it that
looked like a three-cylinder radial mo-
tor

  the truss ran lengthwise of the ship
and stood vertically and the cylinders
of the motor were set in the same plane
they sprang outward from a heavy axle
suspended in the truss they finished at
their outer end in a ring of metal tre-
mendously strong

  there are small ones duvaurier
said at bow and stern but they are to
control direction only this one
drives

driggs shook his head youve got
me where ill believe most anything

ast-
blue magic



driggs turned and whipped
the weapon from beneath his
coat it glinted with deadly
menace under the green light

he said but not that that whole
thing isnt more than five feet across
and i dont care how fast you spin it
or what it does-

  but it does not move still it drives
the ship in my little ship the impeller
was only a foot across yet it brought
me here

  still that little impeller was crude

 ast-

and i could not control it i drove on
and on through space always faster al-
ways driving in a straight line and
at last i checked it this little world
was ahead it flashed past but i turned
and came back  but the impeller
msieu driggs cest tnagnifique
duvauriers eyes were shining and
he ran his one good hand through his
black pompadour and gesticulated as he
talked and driggs listening intently


astounding stories

 learned of cosmic magnetism and a uni-
 versal gravitation all of space it
 seemed was under tension lines of
 force acting always in all directions
 but always in balance were neutralized
 by their own opposing pull

   but duvauriers so-wonderful gas-
 there was the secret polarized it
 blocked off the cosmic strain in the di-
 rection of its negative polarity and left
 the opposite line of force in full effect

   each cylinder he explained breath-
 lessly is but a container for the so-
 wonderful gas now it is inert but
 when the current passes through those
 coils the gas is polarized then the
 head of that cylinder tries to push out-
 ward and it pushes msieu with force
 enough to lift this ship

   you have three driggs suggested
 exactly and they all pull at orice
 and are as you say in neutral but
 when the controls are moved they swing
 on this axle one of them perhaps
 aims upward one of them partly up-
 ward and ahead-

   i get it driggs said you can
 get any combination of directional pulls
 you want man why didnt you tell
 the world what you had the name
 of duvaurier would have been the
 greatest name in the world

   swiftly the light left duvauriers
 face his features sagged and his head
 sank slowly but that duvaurier he
 said was-conscientious he was a
 little fool he must prove everything
 beyond any doubt before he told so
 he made one test flight secretly and
 now he will never go back

   he turned his face away abruptly
 then without a word moved forward to
 another compartment and was gone

   driggs stood looking after him and
 for the first time since this wild ad-
 venture had begun his lips were set in
 something more than desperation
 hope the first beginning of a nebulous
 plan was in his mind

 xv

  sunlight softened to opales-
cence filled the room yet cast no shad-
ows it lighted katharine putnams
face and made very lovely the soft oval
of it and the delicate olive tints in her
skin but it showed too a little flush
of heightened color in each cheek and
the girls eyes were very steady and
coldly contemptuous when they rested
on dra vonga

  dra vonga was reclining indolently
on a broad and very long flat couch
carved apparently from a single block
of dark wood and richly inlaid with
other woods of delicate sheen cloths
of silk and velvet in dark colors and
exquisite luster were thrown across the
couch dra vonga lay on these with
more of the silken masses heaped as a
pillow beneath her head

   one other filmy lustrous veil hung
from her shoulders and lay across her
but while the other cloths were of rich
purples and ox-blood reds this veil
held only subtle shadings like the in-
side of a shell-or like dew glinting un-
der the morning sun it was thrown
negligently across dra vongas reclin-
ing figure and the filmy laces with dra
vongas creamy skin and her hair of
spun gold were sheer beauty against the
darker background

   katharine was standing she crossed
the room to an embrasure in the wall
and stood looking out a huge gray
ship of metal was out there on a wide
checkered pavement it was the ship
that had brought ranee driggs and her
from earth she turned away from it
and moved back again toward dra
vonga

   i will never consent she said if
 i thought you could make him happy
 i would go in a minute but-

  dra vonga said softly never have
i seen any one like this ranee driggs
and who are you to stand in my way
but listen i will tell you again-
blue magic



  the word of dra vonga is given
i will have arkos take you back to your
earth you will stand again on that
mountain in your own world you will
be safe and arkos will leave but ranee
driggs stays here for the last time
dra vonga asks do you consent
katharine putnam shook her head
tiredly she said i cant seem to make
you understand im not thinking of
myself ranee wouldnt be happy with
you you have beauty but nothing else
for you have i think no soul

  dra vongas brows above her long-
lashed violet eyes arched in perplexity
a soul she inquired i do not un-
derstand

  i would hardly expect that katha-
rine said softly then dra vonga
raised her hand and a green-fleshed
man came in from an adjoining room

  dra vonga said coldly take this
kitten to the ship she will wait there
until dra vonga comes

  katharine said sharply the ship
you mean that you are sending me back
-alone 

  dra vonga smiled

  alone-yes but not to the earth
perhaps kitten will find grokara amus-
ing

  back at the red field driggs and
duvaurier had left the scene of duvau-
riers activities and gone in search of a
more secluded spot they had turned
toward the hills

  mountains edged the red field on one
side and even thrust themselves out in
a sharp point into the field itself one
mountain half the height of the rest
but still of magnificent proportions
lifted its forested sides not far from
the ship duvaurier had picked this
place at the base of the mountain for
his operations

  now where a black limestone ledge
projected and the stratum above had
been worn away and eroded into caves
driggs and duvaurier sat on the edge

of the outcrop and looked down at the
row of ships and the crowding bustling
figures of workmen two thousand feet
below

  driggs said thoughtfully four of
them are done we havent got much
time

  duvaurier shrugged time he
asked what is that

  ive got to learn driggs said
theres a way out of this i dont
see it yet but its there but ive got
to know my way around ive got to
know what all this damned magic means
fast time-slow time-tell me what its
all about

  duvaurier said i will try and sat
in thought

  you have seen the cinema he said
at last and the slow motion picture
yes a man runs slowly he springs
into the air-slowly he rises he seems
to-float he comes down again-always
slowly yet if you were that man
msieu driggs the leap would be to you
a matter of a part of one second is it
not so

  check driggs said

  but to me watching it would be
many seconds for the film runs slow
duvaurier was silent for a minute
then regardes you are still that
man and now the film is speeded up
a thousand ten thousand times as fast
i watch and what happens

  it blurs at last i see nothing but
lines that quiver yet for you the
man in the picture time is always the
same it still seems the same part of
a second while you take your leap yet
-and learn this for to not know it is to

be in danger perhaps-

  while i on slow time rise from my
chair you the man in the picture have
run and leaped and done ten thousand

only rising from my chair seeing only
a blur of lines

   driggs said slowly give me a min-
ute to get that electric vibration the
actual speed of all the electrons in-
creased-and that speeds up our percep-
tion and all our functions were on
fast time now then that vibration i

saw-that invisibility-

  then you were on earth time
which is slow you could not see that
which ran fast

  could they see me

  but yes and your movements would
have been droll

  driggs spoke thoughtfully dra
vonga told me in the temple she could
have killed me a hundred times over
while i was jumping to the platform
she had slowed me down to normal but
the others were on fast time she did
it with a blue blast from down below-
she gets some one on one of those black
spots and lets them have it

   faster or slower-it is all a matter
of vibration duvaurier agreed dra
tor built his great device which changed
the time for all xandros she keeps
xandros on that time while the sun
passes over then when evening comes
and the sun is low she puts the globe
on normal time again by changing the
setting of the big machine the night
goes-pouf like one night then be-
gins again the long day which is like
many years

   but the ship was invisible on table-
top driggs objected yet arkos and
fozan when i saw them were on earth
time

   a small machine in each ship is in-
stalled by arkos at her order duvau-
rier explained it creates a vibratory
time zone that includes the ship and all
who are in it but when they leave the
ship their magnetism is discharged and
again they are on slow time

  driggs pointed down the slopes
where the forest thinned to occasional

trees a man was coming out from
among the trees and climbing toward
them thats fozan driggs said ab-
sently but his thoughts were elsewhere

  im beginning to get it he said
and all this helps what looked like
sheer witchcraft is-is just something
we dont understand

  recollection flashed a picture then
he said good lord thats what i
told kitten-so long ago

  duvaurier was looking across the
sky the gray ship comes he said
i must go down it may be that she
will want me

  but he sat still and bit nervously at
his lip and driggs could not tell
whether his words came from fear or
hope

  fozan was climbing he stopped and
waved to them then driggs watch-
ing stared beyond the bronzed figure of
fozan and made inarticulate sounds in
his throat he was looking at a huge
beast that came out from among the
trees and stood looking up the hill

  it was the same as the one he and
katharine had seen from the ship-an
enormous brute its body slung close
to the ground long shaggy hair almost
brushing the rock on which it stood
its head was mounted on a long
leathery neck and the head with little
ears pricked forward was high in air
and pointed uphill

  wind blew down the slope and some
scent must have come to the beast for
it opened its mouth and emitted a sin-
gle scream a blast of savage fury that
jerked driggs to his feet then stones
were dashed down the slope with clat-
tering sounds as the beast charged

  driggs turned back of him the
green guards were staring past him
their mouths were opened wide they
too screamed but their cries were cries
of fear they tugged at their weapons
then turned and ran for the caves at
the back of the gash in the mountain-
side
blue magic



  driggs knew suddenly that duvaurier
had not moved duvaurier said it is
only a shoga and they are cattle do
not be alarmed the green men of
grokara do not like the shogas nor do
the shogas like the scents of grokara
in that they are wise for grokara-
that is hell

  duvaurier was looking placidly down
the hill halfway down the steep slope
fozan was holding the ugly head of the
beast by one of its pointed ears fozan
called out i go now the green ones
-will not be pleased

   he still held the big beast by one ear
as he led it away toward the trees be-
low

  still farther past the base of
the mountain a huge ship was settling
softly upon the red rocks it came to
rest with scarcely a sound

  duvaurier said softly bien that
was well done but does not duvau-
riers impeller operate well also

  its smooth driggs said he was
watching the ship

  from an opening port the figure of
arkos came out-even from this dis-
tance die white scar on his cheek could
be seen he spoke to other green ones
then returned to the ship

   the port closed but an instant before
the circular gate swung to place a flake
of color seemed to fall out-red-like a
bit of red cloth it caught in the clos-
ing port and hung by a thread it was
still hanging and fluttering when the
ship rose

  the gray shape swung toward the
mountain and passed almost overhead
driggs did not move neither did he
breathe but his head bent slowly back
as the ship moved above he was
watching it as the bit of red broke loose
and was left dancing in the breeze

   he slid off the ledge then and moved
down the hill duvaurier went with
him while the green guards came from
the caves and followed with white tubes

in their hands at the foot of the first
tree the bit of red came to rest

  driggs picked it up and still he said
nothing but his hands trembled for
they were holding a scrap of cloth that
had been part of katharine putnams
frock

  he reached in his pocket and brought
out the fragment that had been left in
his hand when the girl was torn from
him in the midday darkness when he
was blind he held both pieces out to-
ward duvaurier

  where are they taking her he
asked hoarsely

  but duvaurier was looking far off
and up in a cloudless sky the gray
ship had mounted high it was only a
speck of darkness against the blue the
speck melted while they watched and
the blue took it up as if the sky had
blotted it out

  they are heading duvaurier said
into space

xvi

  they returned to the ships in si-
lence and only one sentence came from
driggs nervously twitching lips

  the green guards were back of them
and could not see when driggs held out
his two hands and brought the tense
fingers curling in toward the palms
ill break her-like that he said

  he regretted it instantly for du-
vaurier only glanced at him then looked
away and driggs wondered if it came
to a show-down just how far he could
count on duvauriers help

  time passed-hours of time driggs
tried twice to leave the ships and go
toward dra vongas temple but the
green guards stood in front of him and
made peremptory barking sounds and
drew their light-ray weapons when he
tried to crowd past he had no wish
to feel that ray on his brain again

and at last dra vonga sent for him

  she was in the same room where
she had talked with katharine-sitting


astounding stories

indolently half-reclining as before on
the couch and again the sheer beauty
of her creamy body and barbarically
gorgeous surroundings made driggs
breath catch in his throat

  but he stood just inside the doorway
and said nothing until the green guard
was gone then he took one step toward
her but only by a conscious effort
could he think of anything but the wel-
come in her violet eyes as they gazed
up at him with childish candor but he
said harshly you took her away
where did that ship go

  her voice was almost plaintive
why are you not nice to me ranee
driggs am i so ugly to behold
she raised one delicately molded arm
and regarded it and the lacy wrap
that held the lights of dew under morn-
ing sun fell away from her shoulder
listen she pleaded to what i say
dra tor and his father before him

did much magic-

i know all about that driggs said
she smiled and shook her head and
her eyes held a mischievous light she
reached up and brushed a lock of gold
back from her face

  you know only the littlest begin-
ning of it she said and i-i will
teach you all together we will rule
many worlds do you not believe that
i believe that youve got plenty of
magic as you call it driggs agreed
where did you send that ship
how do you know that she went
in the ship

  driggs said grimly red magic and
felt of the fragments of cloth in his
pocket the touch of them was re-
freshing like the touch of cool clean
wind

  he moved over and stood at dra
vongas side and looked down where
is she he asked

  about the soft roundness of dra
vongas throat was a fine spun chain
it lay loosely against her and vanished
beneath the filmy folds of her wrap

  she looked up and there was thought
behind her eyes that driggs eould not
read i will be kind to you she said
gravely then she raised one hand and
drew the chain and the little metal box
it held from where it had nestled the
jeweled cover flew open and the blue
jewel blue as a sierra sky rested on
its little cushion of gold it was like
the one he and katharine had found

  i gave kitten one of these to wear
she told him it is tuned always to
vibrate with the vibrations of this sec-
ond jewel and that vibration is close
to what we call thought it makes a
carrier over which travels thought and
pictures and-and-but who is dra
vonga to understand the many magics
of dra tor but look ranee driggs
and see this kitten

  she was holding the jewel in one
hand with her other hand she reached
out and took his arm kneel she or-
dered lean close and see

  he was looking down into the jewel
again he saw flickering flames of red
and yellow at the bottom of a deep-
blue pool and again he seemed to
burst through those screening flames

  he was hardly conscious of kneeling
at dra vongas side although the per-
fume of her scented body was about
him for he was seeing the blue pool
no longer but a sweep of desolate
barren land under a cloud-filled sky
and a figure of a girl with a torn red
dress leaning and struggling against a
wind that whipped the dress about her

  he said kitten in a strained
whispering voice and as if she had
heard the girl raised her hand and
opened a little jeweled box and stared
down at a jewel instantly he and kit-
ten were face to face

  it was as if he stood beside her he
saw her lips move and seemed to hear
her voice ranee she said why
ranee and though she had not been
crying before now there were tears in
blue magic



her eyes-until her eyes opened wide
with horror and amazement and unbe-
lief

  and only then did driggs feel the
soft pressure of dra vongas arm about
his neck

  he was bent above her and abruptly
with passionate fervor she drew his
head down held it for an instant while
she closed the metal box

  then driggs two hands were on her
shoulders and he pushed himself back
with strength that threw her as much
as it did himself

  he leaped to his feet you let her
see that he blazed that lying
damnable- he stopped for ab-
ruptly he knew that his rage was not
so much for dra vonga as for him-
self for that instant had been honey-
sweet and the perfume of her was still
in his nostrils

  dra vonga rearranged herself and
drew her filmy scarf about her pa-
tience she said-that is a new lesson
for dra vonga and to be roughly
thrown aside-

  driggs broke in give me that
jewel he snapped let me see kit-
ten  let me tell her-

  he had thrown himself two or three
paces away from her now he moved
toward her again one hand out-
stretched he said again give me
that-

  dra vongas hand flashed up

  it may have held something-he
could not see but it aimed at him
and a shock went through driggs that
drew every muscle into a quivering
helpless knot vibration filled him and
tore at his nerves he wanted to cry
out but his throat was held tight and
he could not breathe

  his lungs were restricted for lack
of air and always that unbearable
quivering tore through him

  he heard dra vonga say many
magics had dra tor one more minute

of this and ranee driggs will never
breathe again but-

  her hand dropped slowly and hid be-
neath the coverings of the couch and
driggs gulped air as if he had been
under water and had just reached the
top

  i am still kind dra vonga said

  two green guards came into the
room and led driggs away

  back at the red field duvaurier
waited for driggs impatiently fozan
was with him as he went to meet
driggs

  you are downcast msieu he said
and waited to control his voice but
listen while i speak carefully with
words these green grokarians cannot
know

  the gray dirigible-comprenes
msieu-has returned and the one
with the cicatrice on his cheek also

  i get you driggs voice was low
but trembling with intensity was
the-

  mademoiselle-mads non ah if
only you understood the language of
france i taught her the words of
earth when she commanded but i
would not defile my own tongue-par-
don mon ami i mean no disrespect-
so i taught her the english but the
green ones from grokara have also
learned

  driggs said earnestly you taught
her-then that talk about learning it
from-but go on duvaurier what
about-mademoiselle 

  nothing msieu but we know this
that the marks on the hull were made
only in one place-the black chalk cliffs
of grokara

  is it pretty bad there barren land
-storm clouds-a wind that blows

- driggs stopped and swallowed

he was again seeing that lonely figure

  duvaurier said wonderingly you
have seen that you have been there


astounding stories

  driggs did not reply he was look-
ing beyond the row of monstrous metal
shapes to the smaller one the color of
red dust-duvauriers little ship

  he walked over to it and the others
followed fozan coming close once and
touching driggs hand in sympathy for
the sorrow he felt but could not un-
derstand

  driggs laid his hand on the rusted
hull of duvauriers little ship while the
green guards sensing something wrong
sprang to the open port and placed
themselves before it their weapons
drawn

  driggs licked his lips if we had
just one moment of time-just one
chance he said we could take off
and-

  fozans bronzed face was abruptly
close to his fozan whispered haltingly
while he searched for words does
ranee driggs want the green ones re-
moved not for always-i could not
do that-but for a little time

  driggs said if you could do that
fozan-

  fozan bowed his head and looked
for a moment at the red rock beneath
his feet he said in your world-
you saved me from the serpent my
life is yours-i give it to you now in
ten thons be prepared

  fozan turned and walked away and
his head was held high

  driggs watching him go said won-
deringly now what the devil-

  but duvaurier whispered in ten
ikons if the son of fozans father
says it will be it will be

  ten thons-it was an indefinite
measure of time

  driggs standing with the frenchman
many hours later beside the unfinished
hull looked about at the men of fozans
race their green guards were every-
where and the four who guarded
driggs and duvaurier kept close

  but what can he do driggs de-
manded under his breath

  duvaurier was pretending to study a
drawing he said softly how can
we know now  but he pays for it with
his life this fozan ten thons he said
they measure the time subconsciously
i too have learned the trick

  driggs looked toward the forest where
the mountain slope began it was only
a hundred yards away vines there
were wearing sinuously back and forth
in smooth ceaseless motion he kept
his tone casual

  when he asked is that

  the paper in duvauriers hand was
trembling with a little rustling sound
i think he said softly it is now
driggs did not dare look at him or
let the green guards see his face he
stood looking toward the hundred-foot-
high wall of the forest and he saw the
first motion there

  a vine whipped its head sharply up-
ward then flung its full length high in
the air other vines lashed out and up
the whole face of the forest was a whirl
of struggling stems and leaves and
vines although nothing else had moved
nor had any sound come

  a green guard shouted loudly and
the busy hum of workers went still
abruptly among the lashing vines a
great head broke through the green
twenty feet above the ground a
leathery black neck followed a mouth
gaped red and hot in the head and
clamped down on a vine shoga du
shoga the green guard yelled

  some whirl of wind must have taken
the scent of the guards forestward then
for instantly the curtain of green burst
into violent eruption heads with
broad gaping mouths necks of black
wrinkled leather huge bodies with
shaggy hair almost touching the ground
-these were the shogas

  the forest spewed them out into the
open fifty or more of them and they
blue magic



screamed and squalled with hideous
sound but stood waiting and arched
their necks or swung their heads from
side to side

  men of fozans race were on their
backs one huge beast broke free and
drove down fozan was on him fo-
zan was urging him on stabbing at the
tough hide of the brutes neck with a
metal hook he drove down upon the
four green guards who had driggs and
duvaurier in charge

  lights flashed from ray projectors
but the shoga seemed immune fozan
was clinging flat on the animals back
as the big jaw gripped the first of the
guards and another went down beneath
trampling feet another ran but the
fourth stood his ground

  across the red field a pandemonium
of shrieking sounds was like solid waves
duvaurier shouted above the din the
ship msieu-the ship then the
green guard turned and a metal tube
was in his hand

  duvaurier flung himself upon the
ground but the muzzle of the projector
followed him down it had not yet
flashed driggs stepped in

  there was no time to knock the
weapon aside no time for anything but
one solid blow he put everything he

had into a close upward drive for the
green jaw

  the uproar of sound was about him
from the forest came thunder of
pounding feet as the shoga herd came
down they were huge and ungainly
but they came like leaves before the
wind they screamed savagely as they
came and the men on them opened and
closed their mouths but seemed to make
no sound

  driggs heard the roar of them as they
came on but he saw only the reeling
but still upright figure of the green
guard the mans projector was spit-
ting jets of light but aiming high in
another instant it would slash down
but it was then that fozan charged
back and the green body became some-
thing utterly hideous beneath the feet
of the infuriated beast

  duvaurier again on his feet was cry-
ing the shogas msieu they are
gone mad the sound of the charg-
ing herd was like rolling thunder that
mingled with the unending din of their
cries

  driggs gripped duvauriers bare
shoulder ahead not twenty feet
away was the rusted hull of duvau-
riers little ship he took duvaurier
with him as he threw himself across
the red rock

skyways by clifton b kruse

engineer prock glanced up

anxiously from the arc computer
long thick-knuckled fingers
rumpled the fine strands of his white
hair and his voice was unusually tense

  but we missed pluto by no less than
four million earth miles and i tell
you wiljon kar this thing looms most
hideously in the sky

  the iron-gray eyes of the young man
flashed with indomitable courage for
a moment he studied the plottograph
above the ships controls then turned
quickly toward prock

  the w can make it we will not
have need for a refueling upon pluto
look closely prock by a series of no
more than seven arcs we can swing in
line with the strange comets orbit give
us ten hours in the proximity which we
can attain and there will be a report
for the council at toronto a full week
before the comet nears the solar sys-
tem

  some measure of the younger engi-
neers enthusiasm permeated the elderly
prock he returned his attention to
the arc counter with feverish activity
sonorously his voice barked out the
arc corrections

  in immediate response wiljon kar
blasted the transports torps the w
swerved brilliantly in the black void
of space the plot deck resounded with
the car-splitting whine of its strained
beams as the transport hurled itself with
titanic bursts of energy

  the w was leaping forward in mad
acceleration far behind the fiery ship

lay the solar system still they drove
onward outward the lean muscular
fingers of the pilot rested tensely upon
the transports controls already they
were farther away from the sun than
man had ever dared travel before

   across the screen of the plottograph
a small red light moved slowly yet stead-
ily toward the center it was nearing
rapidly due to the extraordinary veloc-
ity of the w scant inches from the
center point prock called out the final
arc correction at once wiljon kar
blasted the curve he held the w to
first-limit acceleration for moments
only then with a quick flourish he
threw off the power lever the shriek
of the beams quavered weirdly and
faded into heavy ear-oppressing silence

  prock adjusted the telescopic plate
with trembling hands soon the instru-
ment glowed with nefarious life in
breathless awe the two engineers stared
at the strange body which was hurtling
toward the solar system

  it is not a comet prock stared
wide-eyed at the curious object and
we are nearer it than we calculated-
much nearer

   stretching dragonlike across the tele-
scopic plate the rounded head seemed
a seething mass of dark-green vapor
the orange-red fire of its cometlike tail
extended in tapering length for miles
at the junction of the ovoid body and
its glowing extension there was a steady
pulsation of white-hot fire

  abruptly wiljon kar arose from the
pilot seat
the fiery tentacles whipped
in merciless fury-but he
fought on-madly-

  hold the position prock he or-
dered i am going above to the ob-
servation deck there is something pe-
culiar here the council sent us upon
this trip in order to tail a comet through
die solar system but i swear that is
no comet it looks like-i swear it is a

  wiljon kar prock

  stumbling excitedly into the plot
deck collarless and blue tunic unbut-
toned mardico halted in sheer horror

  before the telescopic plate with one
hand gesturing wildly toward the image
and the other clutching frantically upon
the engineers jacket the old man
wheezed hoarsely between his throaty
gasps for air

  i was with twombley when he first
got the call-a regular click on and off
right in the flash cap its coming from
that-that thing out there-like its a
call from another transport only the
flashes dont go according to the codes
and i swear it wiljon kar that not


astounding stories

  the one nor the other of us has even
so much as whiffed the smell from a
cork in a single tankard of roulek
dont go yet men prock cried out
suddenly he was sweating over the
controls a sharp quiver throughout
the transport indicated a frontal blast
prock was braking the forward drives
steadily now

  wiljon kar and mardico swayed
groggily with the abrupt negative ac-
celeration then a quick side blast sent
old mardico in a clutching stumble to-
ward the doorway as the w came
to a full stop he sprawled in a lunging
fall his feet inside the plot deck the
rest of him flailing about the ramp be-
yond the deck

  sacred nebulae wiljon kar stum-
bled hastily back toward the controls
look at the thing look at it prock
the image in the telescopic plate was
spinning madly its fiery tail was gone
yet even as they stared the swirling
greenish mist grew dark and viscous

  but see the tail of it prock ex-
claimed theres a core-it glows

with a yellowish light-

  immediately the w became pitch
dark not a light glowed nor would a
single connection draw energy from the
vast storage cells the w was dead
silence so perfect that it seemed to bear
substance closed in upon the bewildered
crew

  throw in the reserve batteries wil-
jon kar commanded hurry the
cold will creep in within an hour re-
turn and report to prock hell remain
at the controls do you understand
scarcely had mardico shuffled down
the winding ramp than wiljon kar was
hastening in the opposite direction the
master engineer clambered awkwardly
in his frantic rush for a moment only
did he pause before the flash-markcrs
station to utter a word of encouragement
to the frightened mechanic twombley

  around another turn of the ramp and
he raised his voice

  hals are you there hals

  deep silence mocked him wiljon
kar shivered in the darkness already
the icy fingers of frigid space were
reaching through the stout walls of the
w he shivered the tips of his
fingers were becoming numb

  crawling across the low-ceilinged
floor of the compartment just above the
plot deck wiljon kar hurriedly checked
the orderly row of wires the numerous
connections and mechanisms of the great
transport

  thick darkness pressed upon his eyes
he must work by the touch of his hands
alone yet even now his fingers were so
cold that he could scarcely determine
what it was that he felt wiljon kar
felt his way from one end of the deck
to the other nothing seemed out of
order obviously the trouble whatever
it was had not occurred in the ws
controls

  he was shaking with cold when he re-
turned to the plot deck a strange fear
was eating into his strong nerves this
would be death

  prock are you still here

  the elderly engineers teeth clicked
sharply his voice came in gasps

  still here-ship-still dead

  everything above seems in order
wiljon kar spoke sharply i cant
fathom it theres nothing to do but
get in our space suits we cant en-
dure this much longer

  wiljon kar felt strangely calm
the rumble of old mardicos voice
seemed to lessen the tautness of strained
nerves but they must work fast al-
ready mardico was starting to the ramp
to feel his way to the flash markers sta-
tion dragging an extra space suit along
for mechanic twombley

  hear me mardico-wiljon kars
voice had suddenly become deeply bene
dictive-we are flying engineers-never
forget the tradition of the corps death
finds us carrying on
stranger from fomalhaut



  hells fury mardico exploded
harshly that his leader might not sense
the softness which was welling so
strangely in his heart and the devil
himself is the one to worry says i for
such a crew as this will make a merry
mess of hades

  keep moving wiljon kar ordered
with our space suits we can endure
for several hours-but we must keep
moving you and twombley keep on
the go-and cover every inch of the
w until you find hals

   the slap of his fist against stiff leather
announced that old mardico had saluted
now came the sound of stiffened fin-
gers expertly wadding a huge ball of
weechie weed three sluffing bites and
the quid was stowed in the bewhiskered
old jaw mardico chewed vigorously
puffed out his chest and spat the length
of the ramp before snapping the head-
piece shut

  wiljon kar felt the elderly prock
clinging to his arm ill hold the plot
deck the white-haired engineer was
forcing the words from between chat-
tering teeth nothing else matters-
wiljon kar-duty is-life itself-to a
flying engineer

  even as prock screwed the headpiece
in place wiljon kar moved from the
plot deck his own suit remained
slightly opened he was still thinking
about hals with the space suit tightly
locked no sound would penetrate to his
ears for the radio phones too were
strangely dead

  he had to keep going had to do some-
thing something had happened to the
w some terrible catastrophe which
hitherto had not been experienced in any
space ship they were powerless all
batteries were drained they could nei-
ther blast the torps solarward again nor
could they hold out many more hours
against the absolute cold of space-mil-
lions of miles beyond distant pluto

  at the farthest tip of the ramp wil-
jon kar paused to complete the fasten-

ing of his headpiece then slamming
his shoulder viciously against the pprt
he scrambled energetically out upon the
glass-domed observation deck beyond
the protecting hull of the transport

  the queer ball of greenish mist hung
motionlessly in black space it was no
longer seething with the nefarious en-
ergy of its own creation but seemed to
pause in speculation upon the edge of
the solar system at the polar extrem-
ity nearest the w the strange ball
glowed with a quaint yellowish illumina-
tion then wiljon kar espied the nar-
row beam of light which extended from
the glowing tip of the ball directly to the
w

  excitedly wiljon kar pressed close
to the glass of the dome in order to
see more clearly he gasped there
was something crawling over the hull
of his own ship it was moving slowly
toward the observation dome

  it was a figure in a space suit wil-
jon kar shouted uselessly for the sound
of his voice could not extend beyond his
own suit but a fierce joy throbbed in
his chilled veins it was a man it
was mechanic hals

  quickly he released the outer port
stumbled and slid perilously toward the
figure hals seeing the dash braced
himself and caught wiljin kars hur-
tling body in an outstretched arm hals
was talking telling him something
wiljon kar shook his head and gestured
that his radio phone was dead

  now hals was tearing a strand of
insulated wire from his own suit
swiftly he affixed the wire to a connec-
tion upon wiljon kars radio phone
immediately a new and comforting
warmth burned through the master en-
gineers headpiece

  wiljon kar do you hear me

  faintly-but why are you here do
you know whats happened

  i was getting back to ask you hals
was shouting into the phone id come
up here to the observation port-had

back in the w hals your suits in
perfect working order-if you get inside
the ship their power will drain it too
hals sucked in his breath noisily
he sputtered you-you mean that-

that crazy comet-

  it isnt a comet wiljon kar was
shouting his gaze was fixed upon the
distant greenish ball fists clenched
with the absorbing intensity of his
thoughts theres intelligence there-
intelligence which has directed that-
that space ship from fomalhaut toward
our own sun

  ship a space ship hals moaned
moved his huge body nearer wiljon
kar

  thats the answer wiljon kar
was addressing his own slowly congeal-
ing thoughts rather than answering the
mechanics suggested question

   its motionless save that it is riding
with the universal orbit of our sun
the stream of fire which caused us to
assume there was a strange comet ap-
proaching our system from fomalhaut
was merely the driving energy from the
things exhausts

  dont you see it for three years
now the observatories upon earth nep-
tune and pluto have sighted its steady
approach-hailing it as a new comet
here listen wiljon kar im no
scientist-but any spaceman knows that

it cant be reckoned like that great
polaris why the star fomalhaut is
more than twenty-four light years from
our sun

  suddenly wiljon kar turned and
grasped the mechanics padded shoul-
ders in his excitement he was shaking
the awed hals

  another hour-maybe two-thats

all weve got- do you understand

prock-twomblev- mardico-theyre
down there in the ship-freezing to

death- do you understand  weve

got to fight-got to make them release
our energy

  hals got to his knees cold ruth-
less eyes stared through the space cap
one arm clasped wiljon kars shoulder
the other was lifted vindictively toward
the mysterious menace

  the mechanics voice rumbled deep
and harsh through the radio phone
give the order wiljon kar whether
they come from fomalhaut or hell-
the flying engineers will be the recep-
tion committee-blast their souls

  scrambling monkeylike over the
hull wiljon kar speedily regained the
observation deck dropping through
the port he ran awkwardly through the
ship a word to prock and to mardico
-but hurriedly for headpieces must be
snapped into place again another stop
to feel about the bewildering blackness
cf a storage deck

  moments later he was again on the
observation deck standing just outside
the glass dome hals waited impatiently

  wiljon kar was dragging a steel ca-
ble and across his shoulder there dan-
gled a sack hastily packed

  as hals again adjusted the radio
phones wiljon kar fastened the ends
of the cable to the belts of their space
suits from the bag lie pulled out two
squares of venusite plates two atomic
blast torches and a set of hand grapplers
such as are used for emergency repairs
upon a transport when in flight
stranger from fomalhaut



  ready hals deep voice boomed
with hot enthusiasm he bent forward
slightly imitating the engineers posi-
tion

  shove off

  pushing hard with his feet firmly
against the hull wiljon kar dove head
foremost toward the greenish ball at
once hals did likewise the linking ca-
ble curved in a slight arc as both bodies
sailed smoothly across the intervening
black nothingness of space

  the distance was not great and with
both the w and the mystery ship from
fomalhaut motionless it was merely a
matter of aim for tense dragging mo-
ments the two spacemen seemed to hang
in the vastness of space they sensed
nothing of motion only by the slow
enlargement of the greenish mass could
they determine any movement at all

  wiljon kar had sighted along his up-
raised arm as he dove everything de-
pended upon whether they would ulti-
mately touch substance again not un-
til the greenish mass seemed to spread
out and creep upon them could either
earthman breathe freely but they
were making it

  a scant body length from the tip of
the ball opposite the glowing end the
grappling hook in wiljon kars ex-
tended hands sank into the soft rub-
bery stuff of the ball with a vicious
twist the engineer changed the course
of his flight so that his head moved
slowly along the contour of the ball to-
ward the glowing end at the cables
length behind him followed hals

  there was no time for fear indeed
wiljon kar felt as if he were enduring
some strangely wondrous dream the
mass of the thing was great fully ten
times that of the w edging along
slowly the grappling hook feeling along
carefully as he pulled himself forward
he rounded the extreme diameter of
the ball and then halted abruptly

  suspended beneath the greenish mass
and comprising fully a third of the

sphere there was a shiplike structure of
metal midway upon this metal cab ex-
tended a row of fluorescent disks each
approximately the width of a mans
body

  yet even as he stared wiljon kar
sensed the subtle flow of energy from
the disks fully a score of them fo-
cused their weird rays to a convergence
some distance from the ship from this
point a narrow beam of light stretched
bevond to the black mass which was
the w 

  a tugging upon the cable announced
hals approach wiljon kar felt the
mechanics hooked gloves fumbling
about his own space cap now the faint
flow of energy from hals radio phone
caused him to realize how cold he was
the fearful realization charged through
his blood he must hurry he was
slowly freezing to death and off there
in the darlc lifeless w were the other
three faithful ones of the crew

  hals whisper cut sharply upon
slowly numbing consciousness

  to the left-see it wiljon kar

it looks like a port

  wiljon kars gaze became fixed upon
the curious irregularity upon this side
of the strange glowing disks the ship
was as smooth as glass beyond the
disks the remaining mass of the thing
tapered to a single vast torplike pro-
tuberance

  they had to move slowly and cau-
tiously across the slick surface the
slightest jar would send them spinning
helplessly in space eagerly wiljon
kars clawing glove tips grasped the
slight rectangular projection he was
feeling over the smooth metal seeking
vainly to touch some releasing lever
his body felt stiff there was no longer
any sensation in his hands and feet

  hals too worked upon the plate
the terrible fear arose that possibly
after all this was no port at all now
the mechanic was swinging his blast


astounding stories

torch into line wiljon kar strained
to align his own torch so that the two
might eat into the hard metal quicky
every move that he made was slow
his body responded with deadening fa-
tigue how much longer could he en-
dure

  this searing flame of the torches
blinded him by contrast the black-
ness of space seemed a thick impenetra-
ble substance even the distant sparks
of the stars were lost from view the
sun which had been scarcely more than
a candle in the eternal night was lost

  wiljon kar felt utterly alone earth
was scarcely more than the memory of
a pleasant dream for a moment he
must have lost consciousness then the
sharp cry from hals beat through the
radio phone

  were through the stuff-shut off
the power

  throughout wiljon kars frozen
body seared a new consciousness he
felt oddly alert his brain was feverishly
clear in a gallant upthrust of will the
strong stuff of his being exerted itself
in a last supreme effort

  beneath them the aperture opened to
a vast room yellowish light seem-
ingly emanating from the stuff of the
walls made everything as bright as an
earth day at noon swiftly wiljon
kar poised above the opening he
leaped

  as his body slowly descended into
the room he grasped the venusite plate
holding it before him as a shield
should the strange invaders attempt to
strike them down the venusite and ab-
solute ray reflector would serve to pro-
tect them in his other hand he still
carried the blasting torch

  a peculiar shudder shook the room
and through the thick soles of his boots
needle points of energy tingled sharply
the walls of the room grew brilliant
the stuff of which they were composed
seeming to flow as if a boiling liquid
were restrained by some perfectly trans-

parent shell now hals was beside him
pressing his huge back against wiljon
kars

  theyre getting closer hals ex-
claimed what to do-quick

  wiljon kar poised alertly comfort-
ing warmth surged through his body
he felt suddenly free and hals voice
had rung loudly in the radio phone in
that brief moment of realization wiljon
kar understood that the imprisoned en-
ergy of the batteries within the suit had
been liberated whatever the weird
control these tilings commanded it was
at least limited within their own ship

  but the walls were closing in upon
them the fearsome stuff boiled furi-
ously now and the light grew dazzlingly
white yet even before a plan could be
formulated hals swung up his blasting
torch pressed the lever down to full
power the hot searing flame leaped
to the creeping wall hals swerved the
torch wildly

  glaring blue-white sparks of tortured
energy exploded in blinding sheets of
flame the room quivered and charg-
ing bolts of fiery energy burned from
the floor to the thick soles of their boots
whenever a foot was lifted within
the space suits the earthmen dripped
perspiration the heat was becoming
suffocating yet the horrible advance
of the walls had ceased

  wiljon kar was firing his own torch
now twin beams of atom-destroying
flame tore at the wall the strange
flowing matter swirled in fantastic cur-
rents then abruptly from ceiling to
floor the wall ripped apart hals had
observed it first speedily he grasped
the engineers ami they hurled their
bodies through the aperture

  hals had stopped so abruptly that
wiljon kar ran into him

  its dark here-blacker than a plu-
tonian eclipse

  the wall closed again we jumped
out just in time wiljon kar was

ast-
stranger from fomalhaut



feeling his way in the darkness the
flooring sloped downward in a spiral-
like curve by extending both arms he
could touch metallic hardness upon each
side

  they moved forward cautiously now
the place seemed to be some vast tube
rather than a hall in the bulky space
suits they moved with uncertain steps
so sharp was the decline

  its wider now wiljon kar was
saying and then a little farther on
he suddenly checked their movement
this must be a room the left wall
curves away at nearly a right angle
here and were somewhere near the
core of the metal part of the ship

  whats that hals whispered
tensely and moved near so that his own
shoulder touched wiljon kars

  i see nothing

  straight ahead there-ten yards or
so-theres a round gray thing

  steady hals wiljon kar placed
himself between the mechanic and the
ghostly gray sphere he could see it
clearly now the thing seemed to be
building up energy within itself did
he imagine it or was there really a soft
pulsation of energy emanating from the
ball it was difficult to determine
through the bulky space suit

  step by step wiljon kar approached
the thing the sphere grew distinct
becoming now a deep purple and now
glowing until the whole of the vast
chamber became suffused with the soft
red-violet light the sphere itself was
no larger than a mans head and hung
motionless and unsupported several feet
above the somber gray metal of the
floor

  hals had grasped his elbow shall
i blast it

  wiljon kar gestured for hals to re-
strain his fighting impulse the mas-
ter engineers gaze was riveted stead-
ily upon the glowing sphere he seemed
scarcely to breathe at all and every cell
ast-

in his body was attuned to the intensity
of his concentration

  slowly now he raised the blasting
torch and deliberately aimed it at the
very center of the sphere instantly
the strange thing assumed a weird
movement a tentacle of energy
burned upward to a suddenly charged
bulb upon the domed ceiling high above
simultaneously wiljon kar experi-
enced a tingling along the arm which
held the torch instinctively his fin-
gers tightened upon the firing stud yet
there came no crash of flame the
torch had become a lifeless club

  hals seeing the maneuver groaned

  too late-we could have struck-
but now-

  silence wiljon kar commanded
sharply he was adjusting the radio
phone so that his voice might be broad-
casted beyond the suit then draw-
ing a deep breath and eyeing the sphere
squarely he shouted who are you
stranger from fomalhaut-in the name
of the council i-

  wiljon kars throat constricted pain-
fully he could not continue the
sphere had become viciously alive its
fiery tentacles reached forth to encircle
the daring earthmen wiljon kar
writhed as the keen lashes cut into his
body he felt himself lifted bodily
from the floor now he fell before the
sphere twisting and turning as he
sought vaintly to escape the vengeful
lashes

  with a hull roar the maddened hals
went berserk waving his lifeless
torch in a war club swing he hurled him-
self with wild fury toward the menac-
ing ball

  wiljon kar attempted to get to his
feet again the sting of the lashes
half-blinded him with searing pain he
was crying to hals but the crazed
mechanic was beyond hearing commands
now his voice roared a battle cry
the blood of viking ancestors churn-
ing his huge body to a warriors mad-


astounding stories

ness to hals this was death and death
to such as he meant the final glorious
flourish of a true fighting man

  he charged straight toward the
sphere with all the strength of his
mighty arms hals crashed the heavy
torch down upon the sphere

  the room became brilliant with
violet flares the torch had sunk scant
inches into the strange stuff and had
not budged it from its position now
the searing tentacles lashed a hundred
whiplike flames about the room the
stinging cuts brought a maddened roar
from hals yet he did not go down

  bracing his feet firmly he lifted the
torch-crashed it again still the fiery
tentacles whipped in merciless fury
hals spat crazed curses from between
clenched teeth but still he fought
again and again the war club beat down
upon the sphere

  wiljon kar had scrambled to his feet
he was gasping for breath hot tears
blurred his vision for the moment the
roar of hals enraged curses hammered
fiercely upon his brain

  he could see clearly now the light-
ning flashes of the spheres energy ten-
tacles illuminated the gruesome place
with glaring brilliancy the wall be-
yond the sphere was irregular with
countless rows of knoblike extensions

  running swiftly wiljon kar skirted
the room holding his grappling hook
securely lie swung his way up the wall
his eyes held to the gleaming bulb
which was just above the sphere it
glowed hotly sending a steady flow of
energy to the madly flailing sphere just
below

  now upon the topmost row of the
knobs wiljon kar braced himself
with one hand he gripped his torch
firmly tensing himself he swung out
his body shot straight toward the
gleaming disk frantically viciously
he struck the torch crashed through
a swishing arc squarely into the disk

  even as he fell wiljon kar felt his
body tingle from the explosion in a
sudden flare of blinding flame the disk
seemed to tear itself from the hard
metal of the wall

  hals wiljon kar cried out as he
struck the floor he rolled dizzily and
then lay still for a moment while his
stunned senses held rigidly then si-
lence and darkness seemed to bury him
with impenetrable vastness

  hals was tugging at his suit calling
to him oddly the mechanics voice
was weak and choked as he struggled to
breathe steadily

  wiljon kar hals was shaking
him are you hurt wiljon kar
but the sphere wiljon kar strug-
gled to his feet awkwardly hals his
huge body quivering from his fierce ex-
ertion stood beside him one arm across
his shoulders grimly hals pointed

  there before them quivering in
flabby helplessness lay the weirdly
glowing stuff which had been the
sphere the shapeless mass seemed to
writhe and quaver in some fantastic
death struggle of its kind

  but what did it hals your

strength-

  no hals spoke up quickly
when you smashed that thing up
there it took the stuffing out of the
damned ball so when i smacked him
down the last time he stayed down but
its getting dark again-the things dy-
ing collusus it was alive-whatever

it was-but it was a being-a-

  wiljon kar shook himself from the
trance which had held his horrified gaze
upon the slowly fading mass quick
hals we must get to the w-get
them in here-theyre freezing hals
suddenly their radio phones roared
with sound wiljon kar hals are
you here stand by for the flying en-
gineers-but answer me if you be yet
alive-wiljon kar

  hals gasping voice choked out in
glorious relief

  its mardico righto you old buz-
zard of space-mardico-are you
aboard this blasted hell ship mardico
-were coming up-weve got the en-

  hals-mardicos voice boomed
forth with cheering enthusiasm-you
oversized hunk of blond dumbness and
bless your stout heart i says so tickled
am i to hear the ugly nimble of your
voice come on up

  old mardicos stumbling hulk was
stamping down the spiral hall when
they sighted him immediately the old
guardsman halted drew himself to at-
tention and saluted in grandiose style
but the pounding of halss big fist upon
his back broke down his formality

  by the glory of the triple sun
mardicos voice cracked and wheezed
with excitement but such a lot as
you are that you finish a fight without
saving even so much as one blow for
your faithful comrade blast your souls
none the less twas a glorious experi-
ence when all of a sudden the old w
flew into light and the blessed energy
of her reserves shot through her freez-
ing hulk

  wiljon kar interrupted sharply

but prock is he-

  procks coming round sir and
mechanic twombley is close beside him
tis i alone who left the ship as soon
as the blessed power returned ah
indeed tis a sorrowful day for me that
this old mardico could not come in
time to aid you

  mardico-hals grasped the old fel-
lows shoulder shook him vigorously-
youre drunk

  drunk mardico drunk indeed
you pour insults upon this anguished
heart truly i swear to only the slight-
est portion-barely enough to thaw out
the frozen blood streams of this old
body

  wiljon kar seemed to relax at the
jovial banter at his command hals
went with mardico back to the w

wiljon kar remained in order to
gather the needed information for the
report to the council

 in majestic swerves the
w towing the strange ship of space
dropped gradually down to the twilight
city of omega upon pluto with the
delivery of the trailing cargo the spe-
cial detail of the flying engineers would
be completed to the elderly prock
fell the honor of flashing the report
earthward

   blue flares flashed to jupiter nep-
tune luna and ultimately to the coun-
cil headquarters at the international city
of toronto planet earth

   for a distance of twenty-four light
years prock continued the flash this
lone energy entity from a planet of the
star fomalhaut blasted his great en-
gine of space this being itself was
but the brain stuff of some amazingly
advanced life form upon that planet
obviously his knowledge of science
particularly his understanding of the
physics of electricity far exceeded that
of any earthly intelligence

  we have delivered the space ship
from fomalhaut and the remains of
the strange being which directed it to
commander ackermann city of omega
planet pluto a detailed report is be-
ing delivered via the regular interplan-
etary transport system signed
prock m e of the flying engineers

  having completed the report prock
turned wearily to wiljon kar

  well-he grinned and ran his bony
old hands through the thinning white
hair-thats another job done hope
theyll let us rest a bit

   theyll have to prock wiljon kar
replied i iust saw mardico hals
and twombley headed for the space-
mans garden of rest a couple of hours
ago-and with the quantity of roulek
already under their tough hides itll be
a good month before theyll be sober
enough to know their own names

when consciousness began to
return toni realized he was
running a terrible monster
pursued him and every few feet he
threw himself to the floor as one of the
legs passed over him passing a thou-

he caught the man tossed
him into the faces of the
others-then-
      the science was too ancient for the memory-
      too advanced for the understanding-so it died

sand needles pushed through him as his
brain was torn and twisted

  it took a minute for the thought to
sink in-he must run running was
the only escape the farther he ran
the more space between the passing of

legs they were higher above him as
well and he gradually reached the point
where his brain only fogged for a fleet-
ing second then cleared again

when several minutes passed with-
out having to duck for the legs it seeped


astounding stories

into his dulled brain that danger was
past he could rest dropping on the
floor with relaxation from utter exhaus-
tion-he slept

  hours later he awoke how many
hours he never knew but slowly re-
turning consciousness drove the fact he
had slept for a long time his dreams
had been queer and as he lay enjoy-
ing the lethargy of slow awakening
they struck him as funny he laughed
the shaking motion made the floor seem
harder and suddenly his eyes snapped
open as it became a certainty he was
not in bed

  above as far as his eyes could reach
was a network like a giant spider web
this was peculiar and he lay several
minutes examining it carefully it
looked like metal girders but so far
above the distance could hardly be im-
agined and seeming to stretch end-
lessly there was no end in sight and
turning his head slightly the same pic-
ture of fine lacing met his view only
now a larger strand was visible

  suddenly he sat up then he
jumped to his feet shaking his head
and slowly blinking his eyes he saw
the same things the monster in his
dream was a great mechanical rotor
turning on a gigantic axis although
he was a thousand feet from the tip of
the blades there was a faint prickle
every time one turned toward him but
instead of the terrible sensation he re-
membered there was a slightly exhil-
arating effect

  twice shutting his eyes he tried to
wake up where he belonged tried to
remember where he had been last and
the little shop where he experimented
came tg mind as he went over the
last events they seemed far away a vast
distance the way he felt traveling in
europe with home far away and a glad
feeling as he finally sailed toward
america now the feeling was exag-
gerated the distance much greater such

distance was hard to grasp and far
from pleasant

  the picture of the little laboratory
was very clear the perfect equipment
with every type of television and radio
around the walls the most powerful
sets known could bring in stations so
faint they were rated very lovv

  he was trying a new type of wave
that would reach beyond the uttermost
limits of knowledge and had tried for
several days to pick up signals that had
been reported rumored to come from
another planet the codes were un-
known and at times there was a voice
speaking words no one could decipher
the new wave he believed would reach
out and pick up things unguessed in
standard radio work

  he remembered the beginning of sig-
nals a vague image coming over the
new wave from that point there was
a long lapse of time he knew but he
had no way of telling how long it
might have been hours and it might
have been days this dream didnt fit
in at all he felt wide awake he
thought of his watch and raised his
wrist to look

  there was no watch there and glanc-
ing down he found he was completely
naked his mind raced-things were
as unreal as a few minutes before he
pinched himself until small black-and-
blue welts raised where he bruised the
flesh he was not dreaming but awake

 where the question burned
and he knew fear he knew he was
in an alien place far from anything
known to exist with no one that could
help he was utterly and helplessly
alone

  there was the gigantic rotor he had
fled from so exhausted he fell asleep
with his brain numbed by the energy
the blades threw off he had thought
it some kind of animal and that he must
escape reach of the legs the curiosity
of the scientist began to overcome un-
strange city



reasoning fear as he watched the giant
blades swing slowly around

  he stood a thousand feet from the
tips yet could feel the energy in each
of those vast pieces of metal as they
swung past they were beyond im-
agination

   from tip to center axis they stretched
a full half mile and must measure over
a mile from tip to tip each blade
alive as vibrant energy danced and
played along the surface emanating in
all directions

   the rotor was in the center of a room
so vast it was almost beyond his com-
prehension the shaft which swung
the blades slowly around was several
hundred feet in diameter and from the
distance heavy cables were led down
from the nine blades at the top every-
thing looked to tom corbin as if he
were suddenly the size of a small in-
sect cold sweat poured down his body
as the change in things and their lack
of proportion became apparent

  he stood in a room so vast a small
city could be housed within and still
have room to spare slowly turning
his head he found other machines
around the walls all dwarfed by the
central rotor a hum so smooth it had
no vibration brought a sigh of admira-
tion for men who built such perfect
working machines

  it was not over a quarter of a mile
to the wall of the building and hun-
dreds of smaller machines standing row
after row gave hope that men would
be found near them

  the main machines were dynamos
and converters but what beautiful
things silent spinning armatures in
the outside casings spark gaps that
automatically increased or lessened
they ranged in size from a few feet
high to those one hundred and fifty and
more as he watched some would stop
as others started of their own accord
so automatic it gave the impression
of men tending them unseen

  a cabinet to the left attracted his at-
tention and he wandered that way the
surface appeared like glass but there
was a tint to the clear wall never seen
in ordinary glass it had warmth with
an intangible old-rose coloring it was
color yet did not retard the clearness
of the panel in any way but the inside
drew his attention it contained con-
trol boards for all machines in the room

  it stood thirty feet high by sixty
square with row after row of switches
opening and closing constantly watch-
ing them closely tom could see they
cut out certain machines as others were
thrown into a giant circuit that centered
all action

  the energy within that immense box
was inconceivable it could come only
from a source as great as the rotor in
the center of the building but where
could the energy be gathered from
millions upon millions of volts-enough
lierht and power for the civilized world
what could be done with it  whoever
constructed such a planet must have
enormous use for energy

  when he turned away from a scene
more interesting than any play or movie
it was because a pang that recurred so
often it couldnt be denied told him
he hadnt eaten for hours he was
hungrier than he had ever been before
life hadnt taught him to go without
food for any length of time and now
his stomach was crying for something
to work on

  a meal became a very important
thing as he started out to find some one
any one the outside walls showed
no sign of an opening for a long way
and he was beginning to despair when
a small doorway appeared in the dis-
tance h forgot to go slow and see
that no on caught him in his nakedness

  the metal door refused to give as
the bar swung to the side this was
disconcerting and he gave it a jerk that
should have opened it instead he

landed on his back several feet away
with the door still in his hand the
door had pulled out by the hinges

  the metal was very light and tom
got back to his feet with a queer sen-
sation the hinges had ripped out of
the metal casing as though under ter-
rific strain and it was with mixed feel-
ing that he walked back to the door-
way

  the distance he landed from the door
was astounding without considering the
force cf ripping the metal apart to get
it open the door had been locked on
the other side and lock as well as hinges
hung a wreck in his hand for a min-
ute this strange thing held him fasci-
nated before stepping through the open-
ing into a room about six feet square
with no sign of an opening beyond

  as he stood examining the walls for
some opening beyond the sensation of
moving became strong glancing back
toward the engine room he found a
blank wall

  the sensation of speed increased by
the second as he started to throw his
weight against the partition thinking
better of it as he remembered the metal
door he put his hand against the side
and pushed tentatively this wall was
stronger and after testing it for a min-
ute he pressed his whole weight
against it

  the wall bulged where his hands
pressed and the car began to lurch with
a grating sound when he was thrown
clear of the side by the jerk of the car
the metal sprang back and the car
picked up speed again the certainty
of speed made him hesitate to break
out stalling this strange conveyance
he would be in a worse predicament than
to let it travel and see what the result
would be

  the air became unpleasantly hot after
several minutes of the terrific speed
the friction was heating the air to a
high temperature touching one of the
walls it burned his hand and the feel-

ing came over him that he would be
burned to a crisp if the trip continued
long the floor was insulated for it
stayed fairly cool moving his feet
kept them from getting uncomfortably
hot the air was getting too hot to
breathe before the car began to slacken
speed

  the speed lessened for several min-
utes before the car came to a halt the
trip seemed to take an hour after
a minute of standing there was a grat-
ing sound at the partition but it didnt
open placing his hand on the wall to
find the source a slight vibration
shook it

  it only took a moment for the reason
to become apparent the metal couldnt
be moved by the motor operating it
because it was bent realizing he was
imprisoned tom put both hands
against the surface trying the panel
first one way then the other until a
crack appeared at the edge forcing
his fingers through it took only a min-
ute to slide the panel far enough to get
through despite the fact that the metal
was still hot

  once on the outside he pushed
against the plate and was gratified to
see the metal straighten to a semblance
of its former shape the motor pull-
ing from some place out of sight slowly
drew it back to fit against the surface
with only a slight variation to show it
was ever out of shape this was a
relief damage left behind wouldnt set
very well with the beings who owned
the car

  he turned his back to the car and
faced a small room with clothing hung
on the wall like the dressing room of
a masquerade ball gaudy uniforms
hung from hooks complete with long
swords but he was still naked and
it would be better to meet people
dressed in one of these than undressed

  looking over the clothing he found
one suit about the right size it was
a little loose but made him feel more

like a man a doorway in the far wall
drew his attention while fastening the
last of countless buttons for the faint
sound of voices came drifting on an air
current

ii

 he started forward then
hesitated a feeling of uneasiness crept
over him and he took down the sword
that hung with the uniform fastening
the belt around his waist

  he tried the steel to be sure it was
not soft material like the door he pulled
apart the metal had a greenish tint
but seemed of excellent quality

  the passage turned a few feet be-
yond the door and as he went forward
he watched carefully looking around
the turn before stepping out he drew
back

  a room full of men but men of a
strange race were gathered around a
table playing some game he could at
least look them over before they saw
him

  their uniforms were similar but not
like the one he had helped himself to
but the men drew attention they had
the same features as any of the human
race but the color of their skin was
startling a brilliant pink it was not
the color of a girls blush but the color
of a fresh bum with no counterpart in
an ordinary complexion it was a dis-
tinct color of its own yet they looked
like so many men dressed for a mas-
querade ball the color was not dis-
pleasing but looked as if they were
never out in the sun always lived in
a hothouse they carried swords at
their sides worn enough on the hilt to
know they were not carried for appear-
ance

  when one of them glanced up his
-startled exclamation brought the others
to their feet and tom faced a row of
drawn swords the men filled the room
from wall to wall silently watching as

he stepped around the corner into full
view there was a minute of silence
then tom managed to say hello al-
though knowing they couldnt under-
stand from the few words spoken while
he listened

  they stood stupefied a minute longer
before one of them could manage a
word tom listened respectfully to all
the man said but it sounded different
from anything he had ever heard shak-
ing his head he tried to show them he
was friendly he stepped forward hold-
ing out his hand but they only raised
their swords higher finding this
didnt work he tried rubbing his stom-
ach and pointing to his mouth to show
he was hungry but they still stood and
stared

  after a minute the man tried again
it sounded like a different tongue and
he spoke slowly tom shook his head

  a puzzled frown appeared this time
and a fleeting look of distrust he gave
an order and the men dropped their
swords and came toward him his own
sword in the belt at his side was use-
less so he waited to see what they
wanted but when one of them grabbed
him around the legs it was too much
he wanted to be friendly and they tried
to knock him down

  reaching down he caught hold of the
man at his legs tossing him in the face
of the others before they could get hold
of him they were knocked back ten
feet as they fell like tenpins

  this sobered them and scrambling
for their swords they kept back as far
as possible from this wild man won-
der and a little awe showed in their
faces now they didnt seem anxious
to try again as he faced them across
the room tom thought of the sword at
his side and wasted no time drawing
it since they werent friendly he
wasnt going to be caught napping

  the leader picked out three men and
the four came slowly forward with
drawn swords he smiled to think they

had more respect than when try ing to
capture him a moment before the
leader would be the worst to face and
he watched him carefully

  tom was in a tight spot he didnt
want to hurt them as he needed friends
he had no quarrel with them it was
not his fault he faced them now but
he didnt intend to be cut up if he could
help it

  when only a few feet remained they
rushed it was all he could do to keep
from running them through as he
knocked their blades aside swinging
furiously the blade of the leader was
the first ne touched his blade was
traveling so fast when they met that the
other sword was thrown ten feet away
the next one broke short as the other
two were knocked out of the mens
hands

  they retreated at this talking
amongst themselves the leader came
forward and spoke again tom didnt
understand but knew he was asking a
question later he found it was lucky
as an answer would probably have cost
his life for being a liar

  the man was very grave as he asked
who are you that wear the clothes of
a god and fight like fifty men his
face fell as tom shook his head but
he understood the smile that meant
friendliness and as none were hurt
badly they put away their swords
when tom replaced his they seemed
very much relieved beckoning him to
follow they entered a passage on the
opposite side

  with some misgiving he followed but
they showed good will by going ahead
after a minute the leader dropped back
to walk by his side he couldnt fail
to admire the tremendous courage it
must have taken

  as they walked the man timidly
reached out to feel the muscle in toms
arm the wonder appearing in his face
was eloquent

  tom thought it a friendly gesture
so he reached over and did the same
but was sorry when the man winced
and bit his lip to keep from crying out
how it must have hurt although unin-
tentionally the mans arm was soft
and his thumb sank in an inch before
he realized he could break it with one
hand

  the feeling that everything was
wrong returned as he tried to show the
man he was sorry the flesh of these
people was very tender more like a
new-born baby than full-grown men
the man he tossed across the room was
extremely light as well seeming to
weigh no more than twenty pounds

  as they walked tom wondered what
material the floor was made of instead
of the hard feeling of stone it felt
springy as though covered with carpet
it gave a bouncing sensation rather
pleasant to walk on the man couldnt
keep his hands off tom and kept reach-
ing out to feel of his arms they
seemed a great wonder to him

  passing branch after branch in the
tunnel they approached stronger light
as it widened at the entrance of a room
that would hold a thousand people with-
out crowding everything was of stone
there was no sign of the metal that
appeared in the engine room anywhere
in sight the benches were worn in
hollows and at every door deep grooves
showed the passing of time the room
had been here a long time it was tor-
ture to think he could ask about noth-
ing but had to content himself with sign
language

  the leader of the guard or gen-
eral as he nicknamed him had taken
a liking to him and spent his time peer-
ing into his face and examining him
from head to foot

  the room they were in contained a
hundred more men in uniform similar
to the others and they gathered around
the newcomers pointing and asking ex-
cited questions it struck tom so funny
strange city



he couldnt help smiling which seemed
to embarrass them but only for a
minute

  the wonder in their faces made tom
pick up the general and hold him above
his head with one hand to show he was
actually a man a shout went up from
the throng as they drew their swords
menacingly

   too late he realized the mistake but
had to see it through so he set the man
on his shoulder and stood his ground
the man in his hands hadnt said a word
and his face masked his feelings from
the action of the others in the room he
was a man of importance and toms
mind raced for a way of straightening
the situation out

 setting him on his feet carefully he
bowed then pulling the sword from his
scabbard handed it over hilt first this
gave the right impression and the ten-
sion of a moment before melted away

  his -new friend took the sword
very seriously saying a few words be-
fore handing it back tom breathed
easier as the men lost their hostile look
and resumed conversation now the
general took him by the arm as they
walked slowly across the room to sit at
a small table

  beckoning to one of the men he sent
him on an errand after several minutes
of conversation the rest of the men
in the room kept a respectful distance
but talked excitedly as they glanced in
his direction

  when they had been waiting several
minutes he called the generals atten-
tion making motions to show he was
hungry it was quite a job to make the
man understand but when he did two
men went hurrying away to do his bid-
ding in a short time they were back
with several girls evidently of a servant
class carrying trays

  they had cloths wrapped around
them in place of clothes and were afraid
of coming close to the stranger until

the general spoke to them then they
approached to serve the dishes they
were a little reassured when tom
smiled but still glad to keep back when
they finished their duties

  they carried food of a dozen kinds
and all smelled delicious at the moment
none was familiar and he tasted each
before deciding upon a food that was
very pleasant tasting like mushrooms
with some delicate meat added

  the girl who tended the table handed
him a piece of metal shaped like an
oyster shell and it took several minutes
to decide what to do with it one edge
was sharpened to cut with and if the
edges were pressed it hollowed like a
spoon after a little practice it re-
placed knife fork and spoon very
nicely

  while eating the serving girls caught
his attention their coloring was the
same as the men in the room but they
seemed chiseled out of marble stand-
ing perfectly still until he wanted some-
thing when the head girl would wait
on him the features of each were so
perfect he forgot to eat lost in admira-
tion until the general motioned him
to hurry

  as he finished the meal the messen-
ger returned and bowed slightly before
speaking tom was motioned to fol-
low again as they left through a side

door

  entering a car that rattled and shook
as it rose the party ascended story after
story the car rose fully a thousand
feet and al the way it made tom nerv-
ous listening to -the straining as it
squeaked to the top

  the passages at the upper level were
brilliantly lighted and as they walked
along people stopped to stare hun-
dreds were wandering along as if walk-
ing were the only occupation they
were dressed in brilliant clothes and the
womens dress vied with the mens in
color everything was like a giant
mardi gras


astounding stories

  no one seemed seriously occupied
the women did not appear as beauti-
ful as the servant girls being thinner
and much more anamic looking they
looked cultured but showed a complete
lack of physical exercise

  a little farther they entered a door-
way where tom found himself in an-
other car similar to the one that brought
him from the engine room but this
was also in a bad state of repair and
jerked along its track which felt worn
to the breaking point tom knew his
nerves wouldnt stand much more rack-
ing when they came to a halt

 the general took his arm as
they passed row after row of standing
guards swords were presented and the
feeling of importance began to creep
over him why they should honor him
as a perfect stranger was beyond un-
derstanding tom watched everything
they passed closely and was surprised
to see light bulbs broken every little
way left as they were in the sockets
and not replaced

  the lack of repair was terrible
amongst such perfect machinery every
bit of mechanical equipment they passed
was far better than anything tom had
ever seen but badly in need of work
things were so different from the en-
gine room where everything was in per-
fect shape

  he didnt have long to think about it
before they entered a doorway into a
vast chamber at the other end a man
sat on a high chair from which he could
see well over the heads of others in the
room he knew they had entered a
throne room and he was being taken
before a ruler every guard in the
party flattened himself on the floor ex-
cept the general who bent one knee
to follow suit seemed the thing to do

  the ruler was far from pleased that
he didnt join the men on the floor but
bending his knee was as far as tom
would go when he saw the expression

on the mans face he ws sorry hed
done that

  they were called forward and stood
for several minutes while the ruler
talked to the general tom stood
through an examination lasting several
minutes before the man was satisfied
and turning to the general spoke a few
more words

  the general called over one of the
guards whose knees shook as he came
forward and motioned for tom to lift
him he was the biggest man in the
group and tom had some misgiving as
to whether he could handle him but the
man didnt weigh over twenty pounds
as he held him over his head seeing
it pleased the ruler he tossed him in
the air about twenty feet and while
the men in the room groaned caught
him as easily as a rubber ball

  when set back on his feet the man
shook like a leaf and had lost all the
color he ever had the look on the
faces made tom laugh and suddenly
reach forward to the block of stone the
throne stood on raising it slightly the
stone would weigh several tons if as
heavy as he was used to but this only
required a little exertion

  the ruler jumped as the stone slanted
but was soon all smiles again as tom
tried to talk to him after several
fruitless attempts he gave up while tom
tried every language he had an inkling
of he knew a little french german
and spanish but none were understood

  the ruler beckoned to him and
when he came closer felt of his arm
this seemed the strangest of all and the
hardness of his muscles held the man in
awe several times he let go then
reached out again trying to believe it
was real and not imaginary when
tom flexed his muscle he was delighted
and had him do it several times

  as tom was led away he could hear
the gradual swelling conversation in the
room they would have plenty to talk
about for a long time to come
strange city



  the general was quite friendly and
they walked arm in arm through the
passage tom tried to find the reason
for the lights not being replaced as
they passed objects tom named them
in english while the general gave him
the name in his own tongue before
they reached their destination the names
of twenty objects were understandable
and several more he was not quite
sure of

iii

  they finally reached the apartment
assigned to him and as he examined
it three of the girls who brought his
dinner in the lower chamber entered
the one who served the food was
brought forward by the general and
presented to tom it was hard to un-
derstand what was meant but he realized
she was being given to him and the
fact they were slaves became a cer-
tainty

  when she started to kiss the floor at
his feet he grabbed her by the shoul-
ders jerking her erect he was sorry
a minute later he had forgotten his
strength and it shook her up quite a
bit his action seemed a complete sur-
prise to her as well as the general as
she backed away cringing

  later he learned it was a means of
showing displeasure to stop their
obeisance and he hurt the girls feelings
more than he hurt her physically the
general tried to replace her with one
of the other girls and it wa hard to
persuade him he hadnt shown dis-
pleasure

  tom called the girl back and stroked
her head but as she bent toward the
floor he stopped her he wouldnt have
that and the easiest way was to stop
it in the beginning although the girl
had a puzzled look adoration shone in
her eyes and from that moment she was
never out of his sight

the other girls came forward and the

general made it known they were to
serve but they didnt try to kiss the
floor when he was left alone he took
the head girl by the arm motioning for
her to show him around she seemed
embarrassed to have him touch her but
she obeyed it was not for her to ques-
tion anything the master did

  the apartment had outside windows
and she took him to look out when
he pulled back the curtain a faint glow
appeared and in a minute he was gazing
at the strangest scene man ever saw

  a purple light covered the whole
sky the window was slightly above
the ground or possibly he was looking
at gardens on the roof of the building
but it was a mile in extent every-
thing had the strange lack of deep color
the people showed and though the
growth of plant life was very thick it
looked sickly and pale the sky was
a purple glow that started nowhere and
ended the same

  trying to show the girl the shape of
a sun and the light from it was quite
a task but he finally made her under-
stand he was asking about a big light in
the sky after considerable time he
found there was no other light at any
time than the purple glow before him
the reason for the people being so pale
became apparent with no stronger light
than a glow equal to very early dawn
on earth

  when they returned to the room for
sleeping tom had her name every ob-
ject he could find this went on for
a long time and he wouldnt have been
satisfied then if she had been able to
hide a yawn

  he realized everything was still the
rest of the building had throbbed with
life earlier try as he might he couldnt
get her out of the room so at last he
started to go to bed with his clothes on
this didnt suit her in the least and
she tried taking them off but he was
adamant evidently the men had girl
servants who waited on them at all


astounding stories

times as this girl was very much hurt
when he wouldnt let her put him to bed

  it was with a very uncomfortable
feeling that he lay down on the pad in
the corner and fell asleep

  when he awoke the first thing that
caught his eye was the cloth the girl
had around her the night before hung
on a rack at the side of the room he
could just see her bare arm lying on
the floor at the foot of his bed she
had spent the rest time on the stone at 
his feet and removed her cloth to sleep

  tom found himself more embarrassed
than he ever remembered and was in
a quandary as to what to do he didnt
dare get out of bed she might wake
up and chase him around without both-
ering to put anything on he soon
found that thought of propriety between
the masters and slaves didnt exist were
no more considered than animal and
master although amongst people of
the same class the strictest rules were
followed

  he decided to make enough noise to
wake her up then turn his face to the
wall while she donned her robe al-
though it was not much more than a
bath towel thrown around her the
first time he gave a little cough she
landed on the floor beside his bed to
wait upon him

  an argument started shortly when
she tried to get him to take a bath the
water poured constantly through a large
pool adjoining the room and she did
her best to get him to take a bath while
she held a towel and what looked like
peculiar soap

  this was too much and after con-
siderable motioning tom got her to
leave the room it was not without a
hurt look and lack of understanding
that she withdrew while lying in the
pool he could see a stool a short way
from him with a clean uniform laid out

  as he came out of the water and
started toward the clothes on the chair
he jumped the girl had appeared be-

hind him and started to rub down his
back this time he gave up trying to
change their customs to suit himself
from then on he put up with the girl
servant at all the occasions he was used
to privacy and it was not long before
he became accustomed to her company
and paid no more attention to it

  the girl had an appeal of her
own and as time went by he was drawn
more and more to her society for the
first time in his life he watched for the
slightest movement of a girl he
thought he was immune but this time
he had become very seriously interested

  several days passed with the only
other company a call from the general
every day or between the times he slept
as they ate only one meal the ruler
was allowing him to learn the language
before trying to converse again as
time passed he mastered one word after
another until he had a faint grasp of
conversation from then on learning
fast

  the girl seemed tireless and he spent
hour after hour talking to her never
for more than five minutes at a time
night or day was she away from him
and the thought came that he would be
lost if he gave up her company be-
fore he had known her it was different
now that she had become a part of his
daily life it would be like tearing away
part of himself

  their conversation covered every part
of life in borid as the city was called
but he couldnt find what country he
was in every question asked about the
location of borid only brought a puz-
zled expression

  he no longer tried to explain how he
came he didnt know but he did tell
about some of the life he led before
coming it seemed as marvelous to
them as this country did to him but he
failed to understand the reason for there
being no sun

  time was not a set thing but varied
strange city



and though the masters slept at certain
times it was because the ruler set aside
every so often for sleep the time was
rung on bells throughout the city when-
ever he happened to get sleepy they
had no time

  the girls were enslaved from child-
hood he learned had been slaves for
so many generations the time was lost
in history originally they had been
captured from a distant city the name
of which had been forgotten as genera-
tions lived and died without communi-
cation with the gods had ended all
communication

  the gods were the builders of the
great city with lighting systems and ma-
chines that carried on their work
through the ages they had been gone
for untold time and still the machines
went on untended when one went
wrong it was discarded there was no
replacement

  the people inhabiting the city were
a race the gods befriended when their
own people were dying off bringing
them and their slaves within the walls
to act as guards and do the work re-
quired the gods or engineers who
built the great machines died with all
mechanical knowledge possessed by their
own people

  the people of the city knew the last
of them went the way tom came-into
the building several distances below
ground he was looked upon as one
of the gods returned back through an-
tiquity they had guarded the way but
he was far from the way history told
them he should look they were weak-
lings he a giant in strength but after
the first scare it was decided he must
have come from the gods or he could
not have entered through the forbidden
passage

  as he mastered enough of the lan-
guage to converse with the general it
became a certainty he was a messenger
from the gods he knew a great deal
about machinery and fixed various lit-

tle electrical appliances they brought to
him although he thought it just a favor
when he repaired the different things

  the period of inaction on his part
gave plenty of time for thought the
conviction he was in a different world
grew in some inexplicable way the
new radio wave had carried him over
the giant rotor had drawn him into
the engine room and deposited him near
the axis his escape was miraculous
he passed the worst torment from the
power before full consciousness re-
turned and blind instinct carried his
feet in the right direction

  the world he landed in was like their
world of five thousand years before but
with the highest developed engineering
the warmth of the buildings the light
every known convenience was an in-
heritance from a race nonexistent for
thousands of years what they were
or where they came from was a mys-
tery the servant girl gave little rea-
son for the present race knowing noth-
ing about machinery or the things they
used in daily life the gods had taken
them into the city and turned over com-
forts built for another race

  the engineering died with the gods
who kept mechanical knowledge as their
hold over the multitude brought within
their doors they taught them to leave
all mechanical equipment alone by shut-
ting off the power when the guests tres-
passed too far and the fear of touch-
ing anything had grown to be a religion
the race of people who left all the com-
forts rose higher and higher in their
esteem until they were worshiped as
deities

  placing the races in their proper posi-
tion eased his mind considerably he
feared the engineers discovery of his
presence until it became a certainty he
was the only man in the city who knew
anything about the machinery they
used

  the servant girl proved to have the
highest intelligence fully as developed

as the general his friendship was of
great help he was the son of the ruler
and held a very high position he it
was who suggested that tom was a god
and was responsible for the comfort he
received as a guest

iv

  from the windows gardens
stretched for a great distance and tom
learned they were the source of food
for the city hundreds of girls toiled
in them and the crops although grow-
ing very fast were very fragile ani-
mals grazed in small fields farther away
and in the distance a wall several hun-
dred feet high could be seen to inclose
the entire city and gardens

   tom turned to the girl whose name
 sounded like zola zola why is it no
 men are ever at work i have watched
 the girls toiling day after day but have
 never seen a man working there cer-
 tainly must be men of your class in
 the city who are much better fitted to do
 the work than the girls out there

   zola was surprised at the question
 and showed it why the few men
 there are never do any kind of labor
 they are kept in every comfort

   so few men you say tom asked
 in surprise how does your race con-
 tinue if there are so many more women
 than men

   there have been very few men left
 alive for hundreds of generations now
 replied zola the men unless they are
 kept alive for breeding purposes are
 killed soon after birth only those
 chosen by the masters to propagate the
 race are let live history tells that in
 the past men were let live but when
 they tried to overthrow the masters they
 were condemned to death since then
 only about fifty men are kept alive in
 each generation to father the children
 of our race

   at the look of mixed emotions on
 toms face she continued the women

 who are to be mothers are chosen and
 the only work they have is to raise chil-
 dren there are about five hundred of
 them who live with the men i was
 chosen but my master had me kept for
 private work

   tom was very glad zola had belonged
 to the general-whose real name was
 prince cama when he reached out
 and touched the girl she was trembling
 the look of adoration was stronger on
 her face than he had ever seen it he
 found her in his arms and was cover-
 ing her face with kisses before he knew
 what he was doing then as he let her
 go tears rolled down her face

   ill have to leave you now tom
she had learned to call him by name
i must give myself up to be done away
with if i dont and they find that you
care for me ill be tortured it will be
much easier if i die now than to wait
for the first time in his life tom
knew what it was to completely lose his
temper

   youll what he stormed youll
do nothing of the kind im going to
have something to say about that re-
member you belong to me and what is
mine i take care of the whole city
of borid cant take you away from me
i can wreck it in a few minutes with a
short circuit and before they can take
you i will

   while he talked he paced the floor
 and the look on his face was stormy
 they may think im a god but if they
 try any funny work theyll find i am
 more than they can deal with

   at the look on zolas face he swung
 around to face the door and saw prince
 cama standing there with a look it was
 impossible to describe on his face

   well said tom as he realized he
 knew what are you going to do
 about it

   after what seemed an age he came
forward im sorry tom-he had
learned to call him by name as well-
but it is against all the laws of the city

ast-
strange city



to have anything to do with one of the
servant girls as she says it would be
much easier to let her go now than to
have her tortured later for not going
of her own accord even i havent the
power to help you hold her

  im not asking for any help
stormed tom but neither is there
power enough in this city to take her
away from me ill wreck every mov-
ing part in your city as weil as cut off
your light the minute you try anything
bring on your guard and ill stack them
up for mince meat

  it was a vain boast but the prince was
taken back and didnt question that he
could do as he said the color left his
face and it turned a sickly white

 when tom saw his advantage he
continued this may be your city now
but im taking orders from no man and
if you dont listen to a little reason every
one of you will find yourselves outside
the walls where you came from im
ready to speak your language now and
can take over the repair of equipment
which has gone bad but it will mean
you men will have to go to work

  if im killed it will mean your peo-
ple will die like flies in a short time
anyway it was time i got here to tend
to things there is only one elevator
in this building in good condition the
others are in bad shape and only two
of them still work at all there is
only one electric bulb out of fifty that
still burns

  i know you have had to crowd up
and desert many buildings for the same
reason all the equipment has gone bad
but it will only be a short time until
the equipments in the others is the same
way for generations you have done
no work and have deteriorated to a
race of weaklings the servants are
much stronger physically than you are
and it will not be long until your race
dies off of its own accord

  where there were over a million of
you ten generations there are less

 ast-

than a hundred thousand now and in
another ten generations there will not
be one of-your people living you can
go and tell your father that i can make
a strong healthy race of your people
but if i do he will have to do as i
say i have said all that im going to
and if you dont like it ill send you
more trouble than you dreamed existed

 for several minutes the
prince stood trying to digest all tom
said then bowing low he replied i
am only a prince of the city while you
are one of the gods it is not for me
to question and i will do as you say
my father is very proud and stubborn
but i hope that we may still be friends
do you intend to rule the city from
now on 

  no i dont want anything to do
with the rule your father is welcome
to the city and everything in it but there
are several things he will have to change
to save the race i hope he can see rea-
son but if he cant ill force him to the
wise course this girl will say nothing
about what we have said it will be just
amongst ourselves your father can
make the new laws required and i will
just lie an adviser

  as the prince turned to leave tom
caught him by the shoulder im
sorry cama to say what i have
things have been wrong for a long time
here and you didnt know it i know
we can always be friends i have learned
to think of you as a brother

  it was a long time after cama had
gone before tom turned to look for
zola she still crouched where she had
been before the interruption with a far-
away look as she gazed into space
when he approached and swung her to-
ward him it was with a look of hurt
pride maybe ive been taking too
much for granted zola if i have
im sorry dont think ill demand
your affection because youre a slave
i wouldnt want you that way


astounding stories

 the look she turned toward him told
 more than words as she dropped at his
 feet and threw her arms around his legs
 there was no question of her affection
 for him as he drew her to her feet
 and put his arm around her tears ran
 down her face

  dont cry there is nothing to cry
 about it will be all right now

   i-i know but when a god treats
 a slave the way you have i can hardly
 believe it it would be much easier if
 i went to them now there would lie no
 trouble for you and now im afraid of
 what the ruler may do

    to hear her made tom afraid

    dont ever say that again i love
 you beyond words even though i
 would like to help these people you
 come first and they cant take you from
 me promise me youll never give your-
 self up no matter what happens but will
 stick to me

    gazing long and earnestly into his
  face she promised before turning away

   there was a poorly working tele-
  phone system installed throughout the
  building and now it buzzed faintly
  zola pressed a button and stood facing
  the wall where a small opening ap-
  peared after pressing the button a
  second time her expression changed as
  she turned to tom

   hurry there is not a minute to
  lose as she took him by the hand
  heading back through the apartment
  away from the front entrance she ex-
  plained that prince cama had called-
  warning them the ruler had sent guards
  to capture him for treason as tom
  hesitated and would have turned back
  she pleaded with him please tom
  you cant fight the whole palace guard
  you will have plenty of time to fight
  all you want to but now we must get
  away from here

    there are plenty of empty buildings
  where they cant find you in a long time
  and ive seen you fix enough of the

 machines they brought so i know you
 can make the things work and be com-
 fortable i doubt whether they will
 even try to find you there is too much
 of the city to search

  how are we going to get out of
 the apartment zola is there another
 exit from here

  there are many things the masters
 have forgotten since they lived here
 the slaves know of passages that
 travel all over the city and never touch
 the main rooms at all they will never
 find them hurry or they will be here
 before we can get out they will come
 through all the doors at the same time
 in a small room beyond any point
 tom had been she stopped above a cer-
 tain stone in the floor when he was
 sure she was trying to lift it he reached
 down with one hand and picked it up
 the look of consternation on her facc
 told she had never seen his strength
 before since they had been in the
 apartment he had no reason for exert-
 ing himself for any purpose and now
 as he lifted a weight with one hand that
 a strong man could hardly move won-
 der showed in her face

    i heard you were very strong but
  i never dreamed you were as strong as
  that you must have the strength of
  twenty men then she motioned for
  him to enter the space below

     it was pitch-black and for a minute
  as his feet hung in mid-air he had the
  feeling of falling but a he let go the
  floor met him only a few inches away
  looking up he saw zola trying to re-
  place the stone block from the upper
  side leaving herself out of the exit

     he tried calling to her to come down
   but she only tried the harder to get
   the stone back in place when he knew
   she wouldnt come he jumped for the
   opening and to his amazement bis mus-
   cles carried him back to the floor alove
   he landed in a heap and as he got to his
   feet zola was again staring at him as
   though he came from another world
strange city

although a thousand feet away he could feel the energy
from each blade-it was beyond imagination

and as the truth of it struck him he
laughed

  dont stare at me that way i had
to come back for you you wouldnt
come of your own accord take my
hand and ill lower you down

  in a minute she obeyed and as her
feet touched the floor he heard excited
voices from the other room it was
only seconds before he tipped the trap
back on edge and slid himself down with
the stone settling back above it was

quite a job to hold it with one hand as
he got ready to let go but one final
push and his fingers were free he
landed beside her as the stone slipped
back into the groove it had occupied for
countless years

v

  where are you zola it cer-
tainly is dark down here i hate to
think of running away from that swarm


astounding stories

of bees they hardly have enough
strength to cut me with their swords
and i could make them look like a bunch
of monkeys

  her hand found his in the dark as
they walked along the passage he was
thankful they had waited something
might have happened to him he had
two to think of now

  they had to feel their way along as
there was no light but as he reached
up he felt a bulb overhead that was not
broken searching a minute he found
the switch and the way was lighted
every hundred feet there was another
bulb and they found they could see from
one light to another

   from there the traveling was faster
while he turned off one light she turned
on the one ahead so they had constant
light somewhere there must be a mas-
ter switch that lighted the section but
at present they could go along fast
enough without trying to locate it

  several times they stopped and lis-
tened but there was no sign of life be-
hind them he was going to stop and
take out some of the bulbs to carry along
until she assured him they could get
plenty from a storeroom before they
reached their destination

   if we hadnt come this way together
i would have tread it alone seeking a
place none of the masters know exist
ill show you something very startling
before we have gone much farther
there are many things i have never told
you about my people

  they started down such a steep in-
cline it was impossible to talk they
had to watch their footing on the slip-
pery stone then as a light appeared
ahead tom pointed zola laughed

  yes that is where were going
and ill show you a city the masters
dont know is here its a city of my
people every once in a while one of
the slaves disappears and this is their
haven there are several thousand liv-
ing in the building deserted by the mas-

ters long ago and supposed to lie un-
used

  we knew where there were plenty
of lights stored and have been able to
light the places but have never had any
heat the heating plants were burned
out generations ago before the build-
ings were deserted my people haye
gradually increased in number until
there are only about ten times as many
of the masters in the city as there are
of my people

   when they started to kill off the
men at the time of rebellion a good
many escaped and came here but our
numbers have never been strong enough
to overcome the masters the living
conditions are too hard and without heat
it is hard to keep healthy every once
in a while there is some disease that
kills off a good many and we are set
back that much farther

  tom had been learning of another
strange part of this land a city within
a city and not known with a little
training he could have an army that
would force the ruling race to his bid-
ding

   but he wanted to give both peoples
the same rights there was no feeling
of right or wrong between the two it
was merely a case of who had the upper
hand if the positions were reversed
the others would be enslaved and af-
forded the same treatment they had
themselves granted

   as the light grew plainer tom could
hear voices and at the next turn they
were stopped by guards but recogniz-
ing zola they bowed down

  your highness we thought you
would never come rumor said that
you were taken for a breeder and were
lost to us

  at the words tom turned to zola
repeating your highness

  zola smiled yes i am of royal
blood that has been kept in a direct line
although we marry outside of our fam-
ily to keep the blood strong our line
strange city



has been kept unbroken from the time
of our capture in our own distant city
the line has come down to me

   as they entered the building tom felt
a little glow of gladness she was not
a child of the breeding rooms

  it was not long before they were
walking upstairs to the upper levels
they traveled down to near the bottom
of the building before they approached
the entry from the passage

  several times they passed the doors
of elevators long since out of order
he hoped to find men who could help
with the repair work but if they were
as helpless as the masters he would have
to train them before they could be of
any use

  as they climbed from floor to floor
the size of the building was apparent
they traveled several hundred feet be-
tween stairs on some floors passing
hundreds of rooms showing signs of
usage a chill in the air told the dis-
comfort they lived under while other
buildings had warmth and comfort

  zola explained that of the servant
girls in the city many would be loyal
to their masters and would not help
overthrow them so they counted with-
out the servants when they thought of
their own people only those showing
a decided race feeling were taken to
their hide-out and then after the most
rigid tests that was why they were
able to live within the city without the
masters knowledge for generations

  near the top the absence of people
became more apparent as vacant apart-
ment after vacant apartment was left
behind all worked except the ones
tending the children and as they came
into the glow of the outside world he
saw them toiling in the gardens

  they had changed the roof of the
building into a garden spot and spent
their time raising food there it was
out of sight from the rest of the city
as the top stood well above the nearest

buildings and there was none in the
distance quite as tall they were as safe
as though a thousand miles separated
them from the rest of the city and had
toiled here undetected for a thousand
years or more

  the philosophy of the people in this
world was beyond comprehension
they toiled for a thousand years look-
ing forward to the time they could
change places with the masters they
never thought of looking beyond the
outside wall to see what the rest of the
world was like they just stayed

  a legend of monsters beyond the wall
was so strong they didnt dare attempt
to cross it but were content to live in
peace the gods had rescued them and
their masters back in the dim ages or
they would have been killed on the out-
side and the belief of certain death kept
them within the walls of the city

   this building was formerly the palace
and everything in it the finest in the
city used more strenuously than the
others the wear was that much greater
as he stood looking a large square in
the center of the roof caught his eye

  his new friends didnt know what it
was but there were giant machines in-
side tom decided to investigate the
first chance he had now his attention
was taken up while the people gathered
around and zola told them one of the
gods had returned

   hours later having slept he decided
to do something about the chill of the
building it ate into the marrow of his
bones the chill seemed to grow and
every hour that passed it went farther
until it reached the point of numbness

  no wonder the people hadnt multi-
plied faster the outside temperature
was cold it was little better in the
building although they crowded up for
warmth

  calling zola he asked for men
to help with the heating plant they
had plenty of power in the city as the


astounding stories

source that supplied the whole city be-
fore was evidently intact with only a
few buildings to supply now

  after considerable questioning there
was a man found who had once been
down to a place where there were a lot
of machines but he left very quickly
had not the gods forbidden them to
enter any such place but now a god
had returned and was taking them into
forbidden ground to fix some of the
machines it took a lot of grit to over-
come the fear they had entertained for
generations but they didnt hesitate a
moment filing silently clown the stairs

  the fanaticism was pitiful genera-
tions let the machinery in the city stand
and deteriorate through lack of care
the builders had instilled the fear of
touching anything so strongly it had
carried on as a tradition if nothing
was done to repair the damage the whole
city would soon be a heap of deserted
machinery which only needed a little
work

  the trip down the runways and stairs
took considerable time and long before
they reached bottom tom lost track of
the number of stories the building
could easily house thousands of people
the city at its height must have had an
enormous number of inhabitants

  the ravages of disease had taken
them like flies at a certain stage just
prior to bringing in the people who now
lived as masters the lack of sunlight
had gradually weakened the race to the
point where they could no longer with-
stand any hardship and disease had run
riot amongst them the present in-
habitants were doomed the same way
unless some artificial means of creating
normal health could be found in a short
time

  doors that were all tom could do
to force open led to basements far be-
low the point where the building was
used they found subcellars far below
the bottom story the building was
constructed mainly below ground at

least fifty of the floors were below the
surface vet the basements were far le-
neath these it was hard to realize the
distance down to the entrance of an
engine room stretching for several hun-
dred feet

  from ceiling to floor was a solid mass
of machinery and tom knew he had an
almost impossible task it would take
a month to find the use for even a small
portion of the motors and coils in sight
finding only a few of the bulbs could
be lighted he sent two men back for a
supply these people were very care-
ful of their stock and showed they
looked ahead farther than the masters
who were content to waste the rea-
son for the difference was clear

  the masters had nothing to look for-
ward to every day into the distant
future was repetition without change
there was no advancement no possi-
bility of any gain for the race the
fear of touching any equipment had
removed any possible interest in the
city itself life was just to be lived
until the time everything was either
worn out or out of commission

  the slaves looked forward to the
comforts the masters enjoyed and to
reversing their positions there was
more health among the slaves due to
the men and women laboring day after
day in the gardens to eke out an ex-
istence

  the machinery for cultivation had
long since been discarded and no one
could make more a few hand imple-
ments were still in the use of the mas-
ters but it was one of the greatest lacks
in the city there had been no manu-
facture of any kind

  the clothing had leen stored for
hundreds of years in warehouses the
supply was very short and the slaves
had only found small quantities in rooms
adjoining the secret passages which
honeycombed the city clothes were
jealously guarded and the use restricted
to appearances in public none of the
strange city



workers who toiled in the fields and
gardens wore any the lack of clothes
had become a standard thing and if it
hadnt been for the feeling of reverence
the masters felt for him tom would
have been denied their use in his apart-
ment

  when the men returned and the lights
were replaced tom could see every inch
of the room from a small platform at
one end an automatic switchboard on
one wall was the only moving thing
and the feeing of desertion was com-
plete

  he felt the first twinge of home-
sickness and only by supreme effort
could dispel it there was work to be
done and he felt that the channel once
crossed from earth was not to be re-
crossed he had work to do here and
could be the salvation of this race
their hope for the return of the race
who had built the city would be real-
ized through him he knew enough to
handle most of the equipment although
a great deal was new to him

  before turning away from the plat-
form he tried a door in the wall behind
him as it opened lights appeared in
the walls behind clear partitions simi-
lar to the walls of the switchboard in
the engine room tiny models of the
machinery stood before him

  it was like a dream to see the minia-
ture models of the vast machines so
plain it simplified matters greatly as
the parts were placed so their re-
lation to the rest of the machine was
very plain it would mean hours of
study instead of weeks to find their use
hope began to return the task was
not insurmountable at that he could
repair them in less time than he thought
but the question of material was im-
portant

  questioning he found that a large
quantity of cable and all types of parts
were packed in a room they never en-
tered but which was of such size it

might contain the repair parts for all
the machinery in the city it was a
long way off and it would be almost
impossible to bring any sized part with-
out fixing the car which went to the
building

  as he studied the small machines be-
fore him the scheme of things took
form the equipment was quite sim-
ple few moving parts showed so few
he couldnt at first grasp the meaning
of the stationary parts then it be-
came clear instead of the usual gears
and wheels he expected they used mag-
nets to operate the parts sliding back
and forth in grooves

  as the simplicity took form in his
mind it was clear why they had run for
generations deterioration from stand-
ing was so small it would take a thou-
sand years for the amount of rust to
gather that a year would see on earth

  each part had a small magnet at-
tached which tripped the flow of energy
so it always had pull from coils ahead
when the limit of action was reached it
would reverse while it slid back

   twice he reached to feel of some part -
the models appeared so plain through
the transparent surface each time he
jumped as he hit the smooth wall

  the men were dozing when he looked
out once before returning to the task
of digesting the layout of machinery
as the picture took form in his mind
it was not a complicated but a very
simple room that lay before him then
noticing a button below the machine
he knew was the heating plant he
pressed it

  the coloring of the model changed
and certain parts were brought out
larger tinged a peculiar shade of green
at first tom closed his eyes to change
the optical illusion but when he opened
them the model remained the same and
he knew he looked at a type of tele-
vision the actual machines were pic-
tured before him

  on closer examination the parts


astounding stories

showed in relief those which ceased to	he believed somewhere there would

function and the trouble with each part	be a car leading directly to the ware-

was clear toms admiration for the	house from as important a building as

men who took care of every contin-	this

gency mounted	the men read the words over each

  a few minutes study was sufficient	car as they cams opposite but nowhere

to find the cause of failure in the heat-	in the long line was one which men-

ing unit and tom called the men as he
went toward the machine which stood
a hundred feet square

   the master switch was operated by
 a small unit and tom watched fasci-
 nated as it was thrown open leaving
 the machine without energy and safe
 to approach the mans legs shook as
 tom opened a door in the metal and
 beckoned for them to follow

   a switch inside the door lighted
 up every part and the vast heating coils
 took his breath away the amount of
 energy they must burn would tax the
 largest plant on earth to supply the
 energy source for the city was incon-
 ceivable yet somehow it hooked up with
 the engjne room he had first seen the
 energy in that room would be sufficient
 to handle these parts but any smaller
 machine would hardly handle the lights

   the heating unit was in good shape
 and the parts which had failed proved
 to be in working order one part had
 frozen to the track due to lack of lubri-
 cation the tank which supplied it was
 drained and the track deeply scored
 where the metal had traveled long after
 the lubricant was gone

   when he tried to send one of the men
 to the storehouse for oil they were so
 afraid he decided to go himself and
 bring what was needed while checking
 over the parts stored there

   further examination proved that only
 cable replacement was necessary to have
 the machine working again the men
 with him were exhausted and it was only
 through supreme effort they followed
 him along the line of cars in the wall
 searching for the one which would
 carry them for the parts required

 tioned the storehouse several were
 very puzzling as they had a list of names
 with buttons beside each examining
 the names carefully he decided the but-

                               

 tons routed the course of the car the
 cars with more than one name beside
 them were always larger and this tended
 to prove the theory

   one of the men discovered another
 car directly below the platform and this
 proved to be the one to the supply house

   none of the men had ever been in
 one of the cars they had always lived
 in deserted buildings and not one of
 the cars on the upper floors still worked

   when they had all entered the car
 with toms urging he closed the door
 and waited to start but nothing hap-
 pened after several minutes he had
 given up all hope when a button on the
 wall caught his eye pressing proved
 to be the key the car started and
 picked up speed until it tore along at
 a terrific rate he hoped they were
 headed for the right place

   the car hadnt been used since the
 race of engineers had gone from the
 city yet was in as perfect condition now
 as when it wls built it would mean
 only a short time until the building
 would be functioning again with every
 machine in shape

   the car slowed to a halt after sev-
 eral minutes and when the door slid
 back his eyes wandered over rows of
 material every type of part from cable
 to armature complete cars such as
 they had just come in were hung sus-
 pended from the roof

   they were operated on the same prin-
 ciple of magnetism as the other mov-
 ing parts he had seen and the simplicity
 showed it wouldnt be hard to have
strange city



 them all working in the building and
 communication resumed there were
 elevators as well handled by magnets
 mounted on top instead of the sides of
 the cars

  selecting the material they needed to
replace parts in the heating plant he
turned to look for the men they were
not in sight but aftera minute he dis-
covered them lying on the floor where
he left them sound asleep their vi-
tality was so low tom was sorry he
hadnt been more considerate

  the room had taken his attention so
he had forgotten the time and it might
have been hours they waited when
he spoke they jumped up looking sheep-
ish but seemingly refreshed and before
long the equipment was in the car

  when they reached the basement he
sent them to their apartments instruct-
ing them to send down more men with
something to eat

vi

  he was engrossed in the work in a
minute and didnt know any one was
near until zola touched his shoulder
behind her stood several men carrying
food

  dont you ever rest my tom you
have been here over three rest periods
now and i was worried i came down
myself to find the reason the men told
of the wonderful trip they had in a car
and i thought if you were going to
make everything work soon i wanted to
see for myself

  im glad you came zola before
long well have heat in the building
again tell them to leave the food until
i get this fixed

  oh no tom you must stop and
eat now i know you are different from
my people but you still must eat you
may work hours before you think of
food if you wait ive seen you work
on a little thing and know you forget
everything else when you do

  tom gave up with a shrug and
walked out with his arm around her
shoulders as the men showed their re-
lief at the escape from the machine
of their princess and this strange god
she loved

  the other men told of his treatment
so they just stood back and admired
they had gone into the room with ma-
chines of the gods and come away un-
harmed

  he warned them not to touch any-
thing unless he told them or they would
be burned up this they readily be-
lieved  several times they had seen men
touch something the gods built volt-
age was a dangerous thing for them to
be near

  zola watched as tom returned to
work directing the men with their
help things went faster and he tried
to explain the working of the machine
but when they only grasped the mean-
ing of a tenth he said he gave up and
directed their work a move at a time

  a short time later the parts were all
in place and when the men stepped far
enough back he threw the switch

  a low hum came from the machine
and looking in tom could see the coils
gradually take on a rosy glow parts
began to move as the warm air was
pumped through the shafts of the build-
ing

  he shut it down again after a min-
ute and took several men inside with
him as he refilled every tank with lubri-
cant it became a game to them to find
tanks and after a minute he let them
do it alone as he checked over every
part that moved

  the design of the machine was clear
now he had traced every part in it
while replacing the parts the design had
grown on him until he felt sure it would
be a simple task to make every plant
in the city function

  the worship in the eyes of the men
as the giant machine began to work was
beyond description and tom knew he


astounding stories

was cemented in their minds so no
power in the city could harm him while
they lived zolas admiration was the
most pleasing and while he tested vari-
ous parts with the machine operating
he explained them to her

  with the masters she had seen enough
of the mechanical parts working so she
could grasp his meaning and it struck
him he would have to train women to
care for the machines before he could
hope to teach the men

  an hour later the chill was gone from
the room and he knew the upper build-
ing must be fairly comfortable as the
heat would reach there first the men
were so happy at the unexpected
warmth they didnt know just what to
do so all took turns yawning and try-
ing to keep awake heat had the effect
of putting them to sleep they had
never experienced it before and now
they wanted nothing more than to sleep
in perfect comfort

  when zola suggested they return to
the upper floors for him to rest he hesi-
tated

  i dont look forward to the climb
with any great pleasure zola it is
too far up and i will have to come back
down soon to see that everything is
working right wait a few minutes
there is one more thing i want to look
over first

  searching out a car zola told him
went to the top after studying the
words over the door he forced it open

  the car rested at the bottom of
the shaft and in one corner was what
remained of a man it had been there
for untold ages and evidently the last
passenger the car carried

  the men cleaned it out with no more
feeling than to sweep out a little dust

  tom found a small door leading to
the base of the shaft and after look-
ing the wiring over found where the
cables had worn through the insulation

letting the car settle to the bottom
where it stayed until just disturbed

  that was the only trouble and it
wasnt long before he replaced a sec-
tion with material he brought from the
storehouse finding the car could only
settle slowly if anything went wrong
he called zola and they entered

  a board on the wall with buttons for
the different levels was simple to op-
erate and he tried taking the car up ten
stories first it came to a smooth stop
at the given floor as the door opened
before them it was a great thing to
zola and she tried pushing first one
button and then another to make the
car go up and down while tom tried
hard to hide a smile at her childish
pleasure

  when she tired he took the car to
the basement and they came out to find
the men standing in a group with looks
of fear on their faces but the return of
their princess reassured them from
the number of buttons there were well
over a hundred stories although he
didnt count them

  before the men entered the car to
go he thought of something else and
returned to the storehouse for tools for
working the gardens

  he sent several loads to the basement
before he was satisfied there were
motor-driven machines with storage bat-
teries for power that could do the work
of fifty people in a day he must re-
place some of the labor so they could
help in rebuilding or the food couldnt
be grown to take care of the people

  a unit to hook into a light socket for
charging batteries next caught his eye
and with a little searching he found
several it wouldnt be long before they
would have plenty of food

  he taught one man to run the car
back and forth while another ran the
elevator leaving some to load each
car he sent a solid string of things to
the top of the old palace which would
strange city



begin to come back to a semblance of
lost life

  electric stoves were taken to give
some of the people their first taste of
cooked food

  when the workers began to tire he
took them back to the palace arriving
at the top story he was surprised to find
the quantity of material brought over
the dry batteries in the machines re-
sponded to current and began to take
a charge

  when the tools were all placed in
rows by more workmen he decided to
take a little rest and for the first time
felt tired hour after hour he had
toiled with no thought of himself but
now as the warmth and comfort began
to take effect he could hardly keep his
eyes open

  he awoke later to find the building
at a standstill the heat put every one
to sleep and the time they slept in the
first real comfort ever known was hard
to judge

  the gardens were filled with weeds
and the crops looked sick as he wan-
dered around before calling zola the
crops grew fast but it must have been
several sleep periods they had gone un-
tended

  hurrying back he shouted and the
people began to appear as he went down
the halls zola glancing out at the gar-
dens before joining him saw certain
famine before they could catch up with
the work

  after sending several of the men to
call all the people he turned to her
its not as bad as it seems zola i
brought tools that can help catch up the
worlc with them you can grow plenty
of food with few of your people

  this reassured her somewhat but she
still worried when he took several peo-
ple to instruct in the use of the ma-
chines it was an arduous task for them
to operate machines they had never seen
before but one man was especially adept
tom spent some time teaching him to

handle one very well one man learned
to take the charger from one machine
to another and keep the batteries up to
full charge

  leaving his prize student to instruct
the others in the use of the machine
tom went looking for zola in the gar-
dens

  the people were working des-
perately to straighten out the crops and
harvest those ready to come in zola
went everywhere to see they put forth
every effort though every man woman
and child was laboring against time to
escape starvation

  after the most intensive training men
drove the electric tractors and culti-
vators into the fields and the work of
cultivation went forward faster than the
whole population could carry it before

  a few hours meant a great deal of
harm to the crops the fragile plants
were the only ones edible the weeds
were of a rope-vine type of growth and
choked out everything it was a con-
tinuous struggle to grow sufficient food
for the people and the lack of care for at
least two work periods was near dis-
aster the food shortage could never
be caught up it meant short rations
for several weeks to get them back to
the point of sufficient output to take
care of the needed supply

  ten tractors were busy before the
next rest period and the crops in fair
shape although a lot were crushed by
the wheels rolling over them

  the crops were saved but there was
a great loss of quantity the machines
could put more ground under cultiva-
tion but the seed would take away a
good portion of the food supply they
looked forward to weeks of the slim-
mest rations to gather the extra seed
necessary

  tom started a school when the trac-
tors had replaced many of the people
in the fields and before long a crew of
mechanics could tend crudely to the


astounding stories

machines at work then he stopped for
a breathing spell

  the shortage of food was serious and
tom tried to find some way of helping
it out but without result they had to
wait for the crops to mature seed and
grow again the main crops matured
in about thirty rest periods but that was
a long time to go hungry

  he often wondered as the days
passed whether the ruler had found
any trace of his escape and whether
prince cama was suspected of warning
him he had missed cama the only
friend he had made in borid

  at the first opportunity he ap-
proached the building in the center of
the roof

  there was only a small door and it
took time to find the way to open it
when it finally gave he jumped  one
hand had pressed a stone out of place
accidentally and worked the combina-
tion it swung to the side as he mar-
veled at the thickness

  metal almost a foot thick it would
withstand an army he stepped inside
of walls whose thickness was in pro-
portion to the door without question
built for refuge in time of attack it
would withstand almost any force the
builders of the city were obviously not
free from attack when they built the
massive structure

  occupying the whole interior was a
huge metal object longer than high
it resembled the shape of an egg tom
approached slowly not knowing what
to expect

  in the larger end a panel of clear
substance shone but there seemed no
other break in the surface following
the curved side toward the smaller end
he came to a door with steps leading
to the interior looking to see where
the faint glow of light came from he
discovered there was no top on the
building it was open to the sky but
the walls reached so high they let in

only a small part of the outside glow
as he went on into the egg there seemed
no explanation for the lack of roof

  he felt along the wall in the pitch-
black as he crept along his hand en-
countered a switch and suddenly the
interior flooded with light as he looked
around

  it appeared like quarters for men
with a bunk along the wall that could
accommodate forty or fifty for sleeping
tables and small stools were fastened
to the floor every object was fastened
down

  passing through a door toward the
front he entered an engine room in
the center stood a rotor about twenty
feet across a miniature model of the
one he first saw deep in the earth

  several small machines stood near the
curved walls but all centered at the
rotor as if it were their guiding force
a slightmovement appeared at the rotor
and on closer examination he saw the
blades were turning very slowly so
slowly they had to be watched very close
to detect the change in position

  when he touched the blades to feel
the movement he jumped back there
was a current in them-only equal to
ordinary house current but sufficient to
be sure be wouldnt touch them again
there was sufficient energy for the
lights and he knew they must be hooked
up in some way where did the energy
come from  there was no outside con-
nection with the main building it must
be created within the egg a great
light dawned on him the apparatus
was creating it from some force con-
tained on this planet

  the big rotor he escaped from came
to mind it was the source of energy
for the entire city and had been un-
failing for thousands of years the
rotors gathered energy from the atmos-
phere in some way it wasnt created
by them they were just the gathering
point

  he had evidently tapped the energy
strange city



waves on earth that compared with
those here and the rotor had drawn him
over the location of this planet was
a mystery it wasnt in the solar sys-
tem as no other heavenly body had
shown in the sky since his arrival it
must occupy the same space as the
earth but in a different dimension

  the surface of the planet would be
very interesting what if it had the
same oceans as the earth-the same
land and mountain ranges it was far
easier to understand being pulled from
one dimension to another than to think
of being carried through space to a
planet so distant there was no sign of
the earths planets or sun

  in the front of the room toward the
big end of the egg a circular stairway
led upward

  the floor above the first level only
caught his eye for a fleeting look it
stretched the full length of the ship and
every few feet a tube was turned up in
the air as if to be lowered through the
side of the egg where sealed portholes
appeared

  the next floor was quite dif-
ferent and the room he came into had
the clear plate in front he could see
the outside and by getting his face
close and peering down could just catch
sight of the small door in the wall

  there were switches on the wall near
the stair and the room leaped into bright
light the lights controlled from the
switch downstairs were only a skeleton
system they were just guiding lights
to reach other parts of the egg

  a flat board in front drew his atten-
tion and examining it the feeling it
was the instrument on some type of
ship became a certainty there were
dials strangely like a compass but with
more points while-some seemed to point
out certain names as though pointing
to spots on the planet-and he won-
dered

  half a dozen small levers looked like

controls moving one he jumped back

  a hum began to come up through
the shaft from the engine room and run-
ning to a cabinet at the side lie threw
a switch the same type of television
that pictured the machinery in the base-
ment brought out the interior of the ship
in sections

  the rotor was spinning faster and
faster every minute and suddenly the
ship began to rise when he glanced
out through the panel the walls around
the ship were dropping fast as the ship
gained altitude

  running to the levers he put the one
in place that was thrown out and the
ship stopped rising one after another
he moved the others slightly to have the
ship swing first one way then the other
once it jumped forward and it was not
until the nose touched the wall that he
could stop it

  it backed up then pointed the nose
up then down tom was dripping with
sweat before it straightened out again

  now he was in a spot the ship
hung a hundred feet above the floor
and he had tried every lever on the
board when he knew the ship was
stationary he sat down in front of the
board and thought of every combination
of levers there could be and found no
way to get the ship down again

  a tentative touch of the levers
brought the same reaction only this time
he was up another fifty feet study-
ing them until his head ached he started
to turn away when his foot touched
some levers beneath the board

  slowly he tried one only to hear the
hum of the rotor below increase to a
scream and when he peered in the tele-
vision screen the rotor was spinning so
fast the blades were almost invisible
he waited until they had slowed down
before he tried again this time an
alarm bell rang as the doors closed
throughout the ship

after several minutes he tried an-
other very slowly and the doors opened


astounding stories

again there was only one more lever
to try and with his heart in his mouth
he pressed it

  slowly the great ship began to set-
tle as he pushed farther the speed
increased and he instantly released it
but there was quite a bump as the hip
touched the floor again he pulled the
lever to take it up or there might have
been quite a smash but that offset the
fall enough to stop more than a bad
bump

  tom left the ship after turning off
the lights with a feeling he was lucky
not to be stranded somewhere in the sky
above borid to drift with the elements

  the ship wasnt injured as there were
springs on the bottom to take the shock
he determined to train some men as
crew at the first opportunity and to
explore the surrounding territory

  inside the door in the wall was a
cabinet he had not seen before some
long peculiar rods were arranged in
racks one had a hand grip and looked
like some kind of tool replacing it
his finger touched a button on the side
and a heavy shock similar to a gun
shook it

  looking up where the end of the rod
had been pointed a hole appeared in the
stone of the wall about two hundred
feet overhead he tried it again and
again as a row of holes appeared where
it was aimed it had the same power
every time

  a gun  but more powerful than any
he had ever seen instead of the fall-
ing debris he expected there was noth-
ing left the gun consumed the stone
completely

  a resemblance between the tube in
his hand and the big tubes on the sec-
ond floor of the ship became apparent
they must act the same way but what
deadly weapons if their power was in
proportion to their size

  a small tube fitted under the bar-
rel seemed to contain the charge and
after slipping it out the gun no longer

worked he placed twenty shots yet
the charge was only slightly used after
trying one of the other guns he took it
along and carried several new charges
with him so far he had no need for
a weapon but he never knew it was
a strange world the rulers were hunting
for him and some danger might be
around the next corner

 toms new friends were get-
ting thin from lack of food and he
worried constantly about them for
several days he had wandered the pas-
sageways alone and when he found a
car taking it to the destination he
had shot from one side of the city to
the other and been in hundreds of build-
ings anything to keep from the sight
of half-starved people

  he discovered many manufacturing
plants still in good condition it would
only take a little time until they could
be operating again some flashlights
that could be charged were the great-
est find and he used them constantly

  the city was roughly ten miles square
and beyond the manufacturing plants
were great warehouses with every kind
of goods stored away when the food
could be rationed out properly again
he would bring back such a wealth of
things as the people never dreamed ex-
isted

  one warehouse was filled with pecul-
iar little tubes they were stored by
the thousand and tom was intrigued to
find what they could be he had no
way of opening them without spilling
the contents so he carried one with him
for the rest of the day

  when he had reached the palace again
and was ready to retire it came back to
mind when he had carefully opened
it over a dish to catch the contents it
did not pour it had a very familiar
odor but he could not quite place it

when he had shaken considerable of
strange city



the contents out it suddenly struck him
it was preserved fruit of some kind
the greatest find the hungry people of
the city could have

  forgetting he was tired he called
zola and told of the amazing discov-
ery gathering a hundred men he
started out to retrace his steps

  it was a long way to go they had
cars to travel on most of the way but
about a mile of the distance had to be
walked the men were delirious with

joy when they discovered the reason for
the trip and tom had no trouble to
make them work like demons getting
food back to the building

  while the rest of the people slept
they labored and before time for them
to go back to work in the morning
there was ample food for every one
he put men to work in the morning on
the cars that would go direct and before
night a huge quantity of canned food
was packed away they had the first

when the arm started forward the man disappeared-
the sword fell with a clatter


astounding stories

meat they had ever eaten the mas-
ters were the only ones who had any
meat at any time and that rarely

  he had given the people comfort and
plenty in this community but his
friend the prince and the masters both-
ered him he must get in touch with
them some way he wanted to unite
the people in the city on equal footing
with the work divided amongst them
there would be some in high positions
and a good many who wouldnt be em-
ployed in labor but they should all have
work

  he wanted to start the mills and
manufacturing plants in the city to turn
out necessities and all the people in the
city would be none too many to carry
on the work they had the chance for
every kind of convenience if they would
forget the traditions they had enter-
tained for generations it would be
hard to make them sec but it could be
done and he intended to do it the
question was how

  the men he trained as mechanics
were much slower than the women who
had lived amongst mechanical equipment
a good share of their lives but the men
showed greater interest and soon re-
placed the women they came to him
often to find out certain things and
gradually covered every mechanical part
in the building

  he instructed six men in the repair
of elevators and now they labored day
after day to have every car in working
condition no longer was there need
for any one to go and come by foot
cars were constantly sliding up and
down the shafts

  five hundred men were able to care
for the gardens and grow twice as much
as before they were the ones who
showed a special interest in farming and
took real pleasure in it the people
tom had a job finding work for he put
in a big school to learn the rudiments
of mechanics the women no longer
worked but stayed home with the chil-

dren or if single they tended to the
cleaning and light work around the
building

  five men were working on the tele-
phones and a skeleton system was grad-
ually spreading through the floors

  tom spent a lot of time repairing the
cars that traveled from one building to
another one day he took a car with
the destination unknown the name was
unfamiliar to any one in the building

 a few minutes later he was
looking into the room where he had
eaten his first meal no one was near
when the door flew open and he closed
it all but a crack before two men wan-
dered near the room was religiously
guarded as the last place the gods were
seen and there were always men on
duty

  i dont know what is going to hap-
pen i know there will be serious trou-
ble if the ruler does not free prince
cama he thinks cama hid the new
man they were very friendly maybe
he is a god but i dont know prince
cama is certain that if hes not a god
they commissioned him to return to us

  your words would get you in seri-
ous trouble if the ruler should learn of
them but i agree the prince should be
freed our ruler is very stubborn and
would put the stranger to death if he
could find him no matter who he is
it might bring the wrath of the gods
upon us suppose our power was shut
off

  yes i for one saw the man when
he went before the ruler and i know
hes not a man from this city i won-
der where he could have come from
if not a god do you know where cama
is held prisoner

  hes in the room behind the throne
there is no chance of his escape al-
though i wish he was free but there
is no place for him to go his friends
couldnt hide him for long

  as the men drifted away from the

ast-
strange city



door tom shut it carefully in a min-
ute he was speeding back to the palace
with a feeling of sorrow and frustra-
tion

  he barred the door of the car as he
left so no one would use it it would
be disastrous to have one of the men
step out of the car in the room with the
masters

  it was a hard task to make zola be-
lieve the masters should have as good
treatment as her own people for years
the slaves had suffered at their hands
and now she secretly dreamed tom
would lead them to conquer the mas-
ters and take their place the masters
should be the servants and they should
be the masters

  when tom had told about the work
to be done in the city and the use for
all the people in rebuilding she agreed
it would be best for them all to have
the masters free the slaves would still
control the machines for their own pro-
tection and it would not be for another
generation the masters and servants
alike would be taught to build and re-
pair the machines this would prevent
the masters from causing trouble with
their greater numbers

  in one generation they would be so
intermarried there could no longer be the
question of slave and master he in-
tended to hold things steady with a
strong hand until they grew accustomed
to the changed conditions it would be
a hard task but one which could be done
tom decided to begin at once

  zola accompanied him through the
underground passages to the room
where cama was held prisoner he
knew two might escape where a dozen
would fail slipping the ray gun in his
pocket before they started he felt equal
to any emergency that might arise

  it was a long trip through tunnels
and zola was afraid they were lost when
the rise in ground became quite notice-
able soon they were climbing fast and

 ast-

after a few minutes more they stopped
where it swung to the left

   im not certain whether the trap
above here or the next one opens into
the room where he is i was only in
that room once when i could locate the 
passage beneath i know theres an
opening to the apartment where the
throne is and hope he is still in the
same room

   theres nothing like trying zola
here goes

   with a jump he reached the stone
around the trap and after several at-
tempts succeeded in getting a finger
hold slowly raising the trap above

   the room was quite dark as he edged
his way up and set the trap to the side
before pulling zola up beside him not
a word was spoken as they groped
slowly along the wall feeling every step

  suddenly the room flooded with
light as tom faced two guards who
looked as if they saw a ghost he
drew his gun as one turned from the
room he had to stop the alarm

   the man disappeared into thin air
while the other guard stared goggle-
eyed he only stood a moment before
he too tried to reach the door but at
a warning from tom dropped his
sword and came forward he didnt
relish the death of his comrade

   tom tied him up carefully with the
belt his sword hung in and lowering
him to the passage beneath the slab
warned him to make no noise at the
cost of his life

   it was easier to go on through the
apartment to where cama was held than
try again through the passage so they
went forward as they slowly pushed
the door open the sight ahead held them
for a minute

   cama stood facing the ruler with his
 hands tied behind his back the ruler
 sword in hand was talking in two
 places the blood trickled down camas
 chest from cuts


astounding stories

  the two men were so engrossed they
didnt notice the entrance of tom and
zola

  you scum of the devil youre no
more my son than one of the slaves
the throne may rightfully belong to
you but none beside you and i know
it and from to-night no one but i
will

  your father died when you were a
child and no one has ever known the
difference we looked enough alike so
i could pass and your father was buried
as a man who tried to assassinate me

  the look of hate on camas face
would have killed the man where he
stood if a look could kill

  well go ahead no one will know
the difference ive suspected for a long
time that something was wrong you
didnt remind me at all of the stories
of the rulers but you certainly make
a very loving father go on what
are you waiting for

  his face as the ruler drew back his
sword was bestial

  as the sword drew back for the final
lunge tom raised the ray gun and took
careful aim

  when the arm started forward the
man disappeared the tip of the sword
was out of range and it fell to the floor
with a clatter

  prince cama blinked twice before
looking around the room dazedly when
lie caught sight of tom his eyes bulged
out of his head

  tom i might have known youre
the only one who could do a thing like
that what happened to him how
did you get in here

  wait a minute cama one ques-
tion at a time how i did it does not
matter the only thing that counts-
you are still alive and he is gone for-
ever now i dont know what to do
im glad to know it wasnt your father
i had to kill

  when the leather belting was removed
cama couldnt keep his eyes away from

toms face wonder was there and
a little awe he showed he didnt know
what to expect for himself or his city
he knew the man before him could de-
stroy it whether he was man or god
and he didnt know what would happen

  what are you going to do with me
tom i suppose im ruler of the city
now but the people wont believe what
happened to him

  i cant tell them he was an impos-
tor  they would surely believe i lied

  dont you worry about what they
think at the moment cama im going
to take you along with me now later
we can return and they will take what
you say as the truth

  as he led cama toward the trap
he explained they were going where they
could be comfortable until he could re-
turn to his throne

  when they reached the trap cama
told zola to help them down but tom
held up his hand

  no cama she is no longer a slave
she is a woman whose favor you would
be wise to seek for the time being
she is a powerful figure

  the quizzical look and lack of under-
standing was so plain tom couldnt help
laughing to himself it had taken away
some of the ego that was born in the
prince from childhood

  tom carefully replaced the slab after
lowering zola and cama to the passage
below untying the guard they headed
toward the old palace

  tom no longer worried about the
guard he would follow his prince
wherever he led when a word from
cama assured him they were not pris-
oners

  tom said nothing about their desti-
nation and as they approached the base-
ment of the building watched camas
face

  as they neared the guards tom
stepped ahead and they were not mo-
lested a minute later as they entered
strange city



a car for the upper floors the surprise
could not help showing on camas face
the wonder of entering a building with
everything in perfect condition far bet-
ter than his own people had took his
breath away

  zola watched him intently and was
getting supreme pleasure from his
changing expression

   before the car stopped at the top floor
he could contain himself no longer

   this certainly is a surprise i didnt
know there was a heating plant that
worked in the city except in our own
buildings there are many of the slave
men here too many more than we have
left alive for many generations what
is the meaning tom

  his look was pleading and tom had
to explain

   they walked through the halls to the
apartment cama was to occupy before
he told a great deal about the trans-
formation of the city cama was sur-
prised again and again as workmen
passed him with tools and repair equip-
ment for the various machines

  the windows in camas apartment
overlooked the gardens of the building
and tom pulled back the curtains
when cama saw the men driving the
machines back and forth over the
ground he watched with awe

  he had seen machines they used a
thousand years before to cultivate with
but never hoped to see them working
the ground again the change was be-
yond his grasp and the man they
brought with him was fearful of get-
ting more than a few feet away he
was afraid and not ashamed to show it

  tom left cama for a while and giv-
ing him the freedom of the upper floors
and gardens left three men to see no
one molested him

   it was a surprise to find the people
showed no hatred toward prince cama
but were too busy with their own work
to think about him each had his work
to do and was happy doing it

   tom found television equipment that
could be used with records discovered
in a building so long deserted it had
been forgotten and promised the peo-
ple entertainment the machine was
mounted in a hall where two thousand
people could be seated and from the old-
est to the youngest they talked of the
moving figures he promised

  he was worshiped and no task was
too hard for him to set they worked
with a vigor unknown before and the
comfort of home was looked forward
to with the greatest pleasure life was
something to be lived not just gone
through

viii

  as time passed he took cama
through different parts of the building
to see men at work in every part re-
pairing and replacing the transfor-
mation in his viewpoint began to take
place one day as they passed men
struggling with a piece of machinery he
went forward to give them a hand and
spent the afternoon working with
them

  tom had been patient but now he
was ready and called cama to his apart-
ment for a long talk

   ive waited a long time for this mo-
ment cama and i believe you are ready
to hear what i have to say you
wouldnt have been when i brought you
here but you have been here long
enough to understand what i want

  you have seen for yourself what
work does for people when they know
they are accomplishing something
they are interested in everything im
doing they have far more comfort
than your own people who hold them
slaves ive given them many advan-
tages that you lack and i want to do
the same for your people but there
is one requirement i must make

   there are to be no more slaves you
can rule your people the same as you


astounding stories

always have but the slaves must be
freed

  the people in the city must all be
free your people as well as mine these
people have a great deal to offer you
that you have not in exchange that
will be their protection from your
greater numbers i will open up com-
munication between all the buildings
and will put mechanics to work on the
buildings you occupy to restore the ma-
chinery

  you can have tools to work your
fields that will do the work of fifty
men it will mean you do not have to
live through hardship when you no
longer have slaves you have done
nothing for so long it will be hard for
your people to take up the work when
the slaves leave but they will help you
it will not be long before you will be
glad of the exchange you have made
and the advantages you receive

  for a long time cama sat with his
head in his hands and said nothing
while tom watched it was a long step
for a ruler to take and the decision was
of great import the moment spelled
life for all future generations there
could be no turning back the change
would be permanent-intermarriage
would so knit the two peoples finally
he looked up

  im in a terrible position as you
know im a friend of yours and you
have done everything you could to make
life easy for me while ive been here
although i couldnt leave without your
consent i must judge for all my peo-
ple and there are many who will ques-
tion my decision

  you know more about the best
course than i do myself tve been
trained in a certain line of thought and
it is hard to change although i have
tried to see things your way i agree
there are untold benefits in taking your
offer of freeing the slaves and receiv-
ing the advantages you offer in return
you know it is best and i know you

well enough to know that your course
will be best and still i hesitate

  my people will be skeptical and
afraid of change there are few who
will follow me blindly as they cannot
know what you have done here until
after the decision is made some who
were favored by the ruler would gladly
take any chance of doing away with me
my life will be menaced until im well
established as ruler

  i am ready and willing to give my
life in the effort to raise my people
to the standard of comfort and ease you
offer if they may reach it by my death
i will follow any course you select that
will lead to their betterment i am
ready tom to do as you bid

  tears came to toms eves as he fin-
ished he took hold of camas shoul-
ders as his emotion got the best of him

  cama i wouldnt make this offer
if i didnt know it will be best for all
it hurts me to think of the task i set
for you my friendship is beyond my
control but if i could stand in your
place i would gladly do it

  you must return to your people
and take your rightful place as ruler
they must accept the change of their
own accord or it will lead to trouble
there will be some bloodshed anyway
due to the men held in esteem by the
ruler

  i have been working on a telephone
line to your building and want you to
let me know what takes place if any-
thing is wrong i will come to your aid
three days from now i will come over
to your gardens in my ship you can
tell them i will appear then if they still
doubt i will have to show them some
power come with me and i will show
you the ship

  two hours later after riding up and
down inside the walls as tom guided
the ship for camas benefit he put him
in the car that would return him to the
basement of his building

  as the car stopped tom silently
strange city



reached out his hand and took camas

  when the door opened cama stepped
proudly out and tom only waited to
hear the mixed shouts of gladness and
surprise before he headed back for the
palace

  he hated leaving his friend to go
through all the trouble alone and yet
knew his presence would only add to
the difficulty

  he had work to do he had prom-
ised to appear over the gardens and he
was not even sure of the operation of
the ship

  zola felt as bad as he to have cama
leave he had always been good to
her when she was a servant in his house
and now as a friend she liked him even
better

  oh tom i hope nothing happens
to him you have given him a terrific
task his people are all led by super-
stition and will be afraid to change their
ways even if they want to there will
be a lot of trouble before things are
settled

  tom took her in his arms and was
glad the time was getting short until
he could take her as wife he ached to
hold her close forever yet dared not
let their affection interfere with the
work to be done first

  taking a crew he headed for the ship
after instructing them in the work that
must be done on board he went up a
short way in the shaft

  at first they looked mutely at him
with such fear they were helpless but
they soon got accustomed to the move-
ment of the ship and enjoyed the ride

  the first day they spent going over
various parts putting them in perfect
condition during the time they worked
and accustomed themselves to their du-
ties he sent the ship up and down the
shaft back and forth slightly swung
one way and then the other until he was
perfectly familiar with the controls

  the second day he ventured outside

the walls and heading carefully
from the part of the city inhabted b
the masters he ran the huge ship sev-
eral miles beyond the city walls

  the ground beneath was heavily for-
ested and several times they saw ani-
mals amongst the trees but from
quite a height they could see no sign of
any buildings the city they left was
the only sign of habitation in any di-
rection

  the instruments on the board told di-
rection as well as speed and tom de-
cided it would be safe to take a longer
flight but at the moment he turned to-
ward home

  the men were instructed in the use
of the ray guns mounted around the
sides of the hull and they moved them
all out through the sides to be sure they
could be worked the next day might
bring anything and he wanted to be pre-
pared for any emergency

   the ship finally settled to the bottom
of the room built for it it was fairly
easy to manage now and tom was cer-
tain of the controls the speed was
terrific he tried pressing the foot lever
that controlled the rotor on the way
back and the ship shot ahead so fast
it threw the men to the floor

  the next day tom took zola with
him when he entered the ship with his
crew the feeling of a great occasion
was strong in every man and with nerv-
ous fingers they went about their duties

  the guards were doubled at all en-
trances to the building and had been
instructed to call for reinforcements at
the first sign of any one approaching
he had received no word from cama
and was afraid of what he might find
before the day was over they might
attack his people while he was gone

  he issued three ray guns to every
group of guards warning them not to
use them unless it was the last extrem-
ity with the equipment they had he
felt sure they could withstand any size
force


astounding stories

  slowly the ship rose and circled
before heading for the building a mile
and a half away the crew were per-
fectly at home now and he felt they
could be depended on in an emergency
they were the proudest men in the
building it would almost seem as
though they had been seated on the
highest throne

  every man was as nervous as tom
when the gardens came into view no
sign of people waiting to meet them
made apprehension grow that things
werent right

  when the ship settled on the gar-
dens a short way from the building tom
walked down to the floor below every
man stood at his station by one of the
ray guns

  selecting one of the men he had him
place his gun through the side of the
ship toward the entrance of the build-
ing

  if they should attack me while i am
out there you will have to use the gun
but dont shoot unless i signal to you
there will be too many for me to
handle

  the men stood stiffly at their posts
they felt and showed their importance
as tom went on down to the small
door in the hull

  the din from within the building was
loud enough to be heard the minute the
door opened and toms heart stopped
beating as the sound of fighting came
very clear there was a terrific battle
going on inside and he had no way of
knowing which way it went he
couldnt go in to see as the ship would
be stranded if he left none of the men
would dare try to take it off the ground

  in a minute some men came slowly
out of the door nearest the ship he
couldnt see whether they were friendly
from where he stood but they all car-
ried swords

  as they approached he was sure they
meant no good they came slowly with

drawn swords as though to do away
with him at all costs

  when they came within a hundred
feet he held up his hand

  where is your ruler prince cama
if anything has happened to him it will
go bad with every one behind it if
youre here on a peaceful mission where
is your ruler if youre not dont ap-
proach any closer or ill kill all of you

  they hesitated a moment talking
among themselves but suddenly rushed
toward him with their swords in front

  tom motioned to stay back but when
they came on he reluctantly motioned
to the man at the gun

  there was a slight flash as the men
disappeared and a hole appeared in the
ground the people in the doorway
drew back then a larger group of
men rushed out they came at break-
neck speed this time as though speed
could overcome the strange gun

  again he motioned to the man and
another hole appeared where they had
been two escaped the blast and came
on tom reluctantly pulled the gun
from his belt and blew them out of
existence

  the people now stood timidly in the
doorway looking out not daring to ven-
ture from the building

  the din from within was plainer than
it had been and tom was worried it
was time to take a hand and he stepped
forward toward the door

  if your prince is alive you are lucky
if not every man who has raised a
hand against him will die at my hands
if he doesnt come out ill come in
clear the way or you will go the way
the others have

  the men backed away at this warning
and left the door clear as tom waited
impatiently

  when several minutes passed with no
sign from within he called ten of the
men to him with ray guns and entered
the building

  as they passed through the hallways
strange city



a face would appear once in a while
only to be withdrawn for a long way
no one was in plain sight but suddenly
rounding a corner they came upon the
back of men fighting tom hesitated
until he saw camas face among the
men on the other side of the room

  careful men not to shoot toward
the men on the other side but just pick
out the men in this group when they
are toward a blank wall from you for-
ward

  the first sign they got came when
tom fell on their backs with his men
and cut them down with his guns in
less time than it took to advance ten
feet the battle was ended the rebels
gave up under the withering action of
the guns and dropped their swords

  prince cama came forward with
a small group behind him they
showed marks of the fierce fighting
without a word the rebels turned and
filed back through the passages to the
gardens

  when they were well away from the
building tom turned to cama i had
to kill some of your people who tried
to attack the ship as well as those in-
side im sorry to have had to kill so
many

  cama smiled if you hadnt i would
still be fighting for my life the men
you killed were trouble-makers there
is no real backbone to the rebellion
they werent subjects ill miss most
of the people are satisfied to follow me
whatever i do

  tom turned to his companion

  it wont be long now zola until
we are man and wife and ill not be
sorry

  before returning to the palace tom
ran several miles out over the open
country for zola to have her first look
beyond the city walls the country
was very beautiful it made tom feel
like going down for a run on real earth
for a change there were open

stretches as well as thick forest and the
game was thick a group of animals
in one of the clearings looked like wild
cattle and tom thought there would be
plenty of fresh meat for the people of
the city by a little work

  they finally turned back but not
until tom promised to bring zola out
here some time to walk on the ground
and through the trees

  during the following days as the
slaves were freed tom took a group
of mechanics to the main building of
prince cama and went to work repair-
ing the wear of centuries

  the best-known people gathered for
the ceremony as tom and zola were
married fully a thousand of camas
people were in the great hall before
time for the ceremony to begin

  tom led zola up the aisle so the
audience would see he was taking her
as his wife former slaves and masters
sat side by side as new interest was
created between men and girls of the
two former classes there was no room
for hard feelings each had gained too
much

  as tom reached the platform and
helped zola to the seats arranged for
diem he saw a movement at the back
of the room prince cama was leading
some girl forward by the hand

  this was a complete surprise to tom
he didnt know cama cared for any
girl and his coming forward in the wed-
ding ceremony was a shock

  the girl walked with eyes cast down
and it wasnt until they were a few feet
away tom saw who she was not one
of the masters but a slave girl his
heart swelled to think of the effort it
must have been for cama to walk unex-
pectedly down the aisle with a former
slave

 the crowd at first made no
sound it was perfectly still until they
too were seated on the platform then


astounding stories

cheers shook the roof some may have
been shocked but only for a minute
they knew the prince had dropped all
barriers between the two peoples and
nothing could separate them now

  the cheering continued until prince
cama got to his feet and spoke

  i am very glad you think i do right
in marrying one we considered a differ-
ent race from ours a short time ago
we will all gain from intermarriage and
i hope no one among the people will
hesitate to marry the girl of his choice

  there is something else i want to
say while you are gathered here the
man who brought us the greatest hap-
piness we have ever known has prom-
ised to show us the new moving figures
to-night it is only the beginning of
the new improvements we can expect
we will have all the clothes we need
the gardens have been extended by the
machines and all of our machines are
being put in order again we shall
have such prosperity as we hadnt
dreamed existed

  to the man who came unexpectedly
amongst us we owe it all and i would
like to see him supreme ruler over all
borid who else with me would see
him with the power of life and death
over all people

  the crowd rose slowly to its feet
tom could hardly find his voice for a
while

  to you prince cama and all the
people gathered here i want to say i
thank you i will put forth every effort
to bring you peace and happiness i

have been building a giant lamp to re-
place the sunlight that is needed to make
the city healthy and i hope to cure the
diseases that have run through your
people every few years

  i have a great deal of work to do
and it will take most of my time for
this reason i wish to make a suggestion

  let prince cama rule you i will
still be high in authority if you wish
but he will make a far better ruler than
i can i am here to rebuild the city

  he will rule justly and fairly i
am taking your ruler away from some
of you by marrying zola and it leaves
you to seek a new ruler there is not
a man or woman who does not know
cama will be the fairest ruler you have
ever had

  let me hold the position of arbiter
over all the planet but he shall be ruler
of the city of borid i believe there
may be people elsewhere and i wish to
find out with your permission as the
arbiter of the planet i will make him
ruler of borid

  as he finished the roar of approval
could be heard for miles and those who
could not be there stopped what they
were doing to listen

  when he turned to sit down he looked
at zola her look of adoration caused
him to clasp her in his arms he had
inherited the finest flower of the planet
as well as its destiny

  he had found a new world and the
world had clasped him to its heart the
earth wherever it was seemed very
very far away
 i will answer them all-bob

  note i want every serious science-fiction
redder to receive this message just as  received
it i want you to all receive the some impres-
sion i received as i read these two letters
lleasc read them cartjully

dear editor

  inclosed is fi letter i was instructed to mail
to you the th of october but iu the sudden
turn of events that followed i overlooked it
until to-day

  perhaps you may already know it by this
time but our friend bob has passed on
strangely enough the last words i ever heard
him say concerned your magazine as i left
the hospital he gave me the inclosed letter to
mail add requested that when  returned the
nest day i tiring a new copy of astounding
stories with me i did but unfortunately i
was too late he was operated upon that morn-
ing and never regained consciousness-anne
smidley

dear editor

  to-morrow will be the third wednesday and
astounding will help fill in a lot of empty
hours  never knew lefore how much i liked
astounding until  found myself in a spot with
nothing to do but count the days

  what i want to talk about is all these fly-
by-night societies popping up in brass tacks
in my opinion the majority of those are for
one reason only-publicity perhaps they got
jealous of all the space spwsstfm was hog-
ging and decided to cash in on some if the
free advertising dozens have already appeared
to-morrows issue will doubtless announce a half
dozen new ones and i bet that yon gel plenty
of letters announcing others that you dont
print in fact there are so many clubs the
whole thing is becoming a bore

   have thought a lot about it and have
come to only one conclusion all of these
societies must be banded into one or two the
combined rosters of the-two shall we say-
will amount to hundreds

  the two elubs with the largest membership
should be the leaders all the smaller ones
merging into the two larger ones for instance 
all the societies for staples join the spwsstfm 

all societies against them join whoever has the
largest roster on that side-which is not the
iaopusa by any means

  i intend to work toward this goal when i

fet back on my feet again in the meantime
wish some of the gang would start the ball
rolling you have favored such a move editor
i would suggest one person take it upon his
shoulders until i can get back into the iigbt

  you know the spwsstfm will be one year
old this november i inteuded to put out a
birthday issue of the djournal but the pill
rollers and sawbones have taken all my cash-
so it must wait

  am going to close as the eats are coming-
and you ought to sec the swell nurse that feeds
me you fellows that havent fot any letter
from me please excuse it i will answer em
all as soon as i get out of here-bob tucker

  note ive have lost a staunch supporter and
he leaves a challenge to you to carry on think
carefully over his message conccming science-
flction organizations there could be no finer
tribute to his memory than the accomplishment
of the goal toward which he bent his thoughts
tpfll you accept his challenge and work for
unityr

problems answered

dear editor

  this will be my first letter to you in two years
of reading yonr magazine since i have been
reading astounding ktories i have noticed little
worthy of railing for a complaint there have
of conrse been minor errors but these are al-
aost unavoidable

  in regard to a semimonthly if you can give
os as good a laacazine ko to it but keep the
standard where it is in reading the october
brass tacks i noticed a few points i may be
able ro clear up for the boys

  tvihis conover wants the btar that tfould
not behave explained let us assume we have
a sphere of light minutes diameter with a per-
fectly reflecting inner surface if we put an
electric light bulb at the center of the globe let
it shine for n short time and then remove it we
create a somewhat similar condition


astounding stories

  the light rays will go to the mirror surface

ana reflect back on their original paths when
they reach the center each ray will pass through
the center of origin anil to the person stand-
ing near it will seem as if he were seeing the
orurinal bulb but it is really only a concentra-
tion of the original liht rays anti what he sees
is the back of the bulb the concentration will
continue to reappear at equal intervals until the
rays are all gone

  to bob cloud  the image would move only
at the original speed of the object try this by
taking a magnifying glass and focusing a mov-
ing light on a sheet of paper the rays travel
at light speed but the image they form moves
only as the original object moves

  in the original large sphere a person looking
away from the center would see only a slight
brightening of the darkness the amount of
brightness would depend on the distance from
the eye to tho center

  douglas mayer wants to know why the moon
is used for the jump to mars in the son of old
faithful it figures out that a speed of about
 miles per second is necessary to escape from
earths gravity while only  miles per second
will release one from that of the moon there-
fore a ship would use less fuel in going from
the moon or with the same load of fuel could
make better time on the trip due to the added
speed in the story speed seemed to be es-
sential

  to dictator tucker his cohorts and his oppo-
nents i say  wire staples or no wire staples
its a good book so what

  i see by your editorial you want criticism
have some

  the cover is poor brown shows the nebula
appearing as a gas swirling around the room
when it is so thin a gas that it could be de-
tected only by instruments for the same story
dold and brown show seenes only a few seconds
apart jn that time the hero makes a complete
change of helmet since he is surrounded by the
pseudoncbullum how did he do it dold also
shows the nebula through the window when it
has already hit the earth and would not be
visible

  for the way of all earth marchioni shows
the space reptiles with feet although what use
they would be to creatures of space is beyond
inc neither can i see the need of wings to
creatures of an airless void who are unaffected
by gravity

  a final suggestion why not give a years sub-
scription to the writer of the best letter to brass
tacks in respect to constructive criticism etc
make it one every three or six months

  lets have doc smiths next story when it is
ready-d c thomas  forbes st pitts-
burgh pennsylvania

thank you

dear editor

  although i have not written you for some
time do not think that i have been inactive
since  have last written i have introduced two
new readers to astounding stories and other
sclence-liction magazines and at present im

setting to work on another fellow to whom i
ave loaned my current issue of astounding
stories

  and by the way would it be all right if i
say hollo to an avid sclence-fictlon fan friend
of mine through your columns im speaking
of ernest e rowland jr of de lane florida
although he is not known to brass tacks ho
has done a great deal to further science-flctlou
and also astounding stories

  yonr october pep editorial was great the
editorials always are so sincere that i actually
feel as though i know the editor

  this current cover is one of browns best
when there are figures involved it always makes
the cover more interesting to me i also think
that if browns covers were a little bit more
vivid and if he blended his colors more they
would look a whole lot better

  frank b longs stories are always interest-

ing to me they involve more human interest
and less dry technical explanations

  while im on the subject of science and tech-
nicalities couldnt we have stories with science
in them but not stories with two and three para-
graphs of scientific description and whole pages
that are all nothing but a scientific lecture

  another thing that greatly annoys me is
something like tills professor so-and-so un-
consciously lapsed into his lecture room style
and addressed mr whosis as though he were a
class of students

  best wishes foe your third year-james n
mooney co longshore westport connecticut

its the edges again

dear editor

  this is my first letter to you it includes
compliments and slams the compliments go to
nat schachner s g weinbaum d r daniels
and jack williamson for their excellent stories
i am not ood is perfect it is exciting with
just enough science to make it possible tho
planet of doubt is good and also islands of the
sun the story kight didnt seem very plausible
but it was interesting

  there has been a lot of talk in brass tacks
about the edges of the pages of the magazine
as for me you can have them any darned way
you please i buy the magazine for the stories
not for the looks of the edges

  a while ago i got a rival science-fietion maga-
zine and compared it with astounding stories
the stories in the other were rotten but there
was one thing pretty good the editors note at
the foot of each letter why cant you have
that in your magazine

  the illustrations are pretty good e dold
is running true to form-

  you can add my vote for a semimonthly if
ou can keep up the high standard my main
ope is that you put a note at the bottom of
each letter and lift the burden of questions from
our weary shoulders-kay williamson

power en masse

dear editor

  inasmuch as your magazine is the best in the
field and has i he greatest possibilities as an
ideal science-fictlon magazine we should like to
have this published as we hope an inspiration
for readers of a similar mind to express them-
selves-

  our intentions in writing this letter are to
settle once and for all whether the readers will
do something about the present situation there
has been in your columns a great deal of con-
troversy as to the virtues of your magazine but
never before has any group of readers banded
themselves together for the achievement of a
common aim with- this purpose in mind we
are going to voice what we hope to be correc-
tions

  as to the illustrations and illustrators we
believe that dold is far superior to any other
illustrator in the field and that he should be
given covers as well as interior illustrations
of course we realize as has been proven by
your competitors that no single artist can do
all illustrations exclusively and so we advo-
cate m marchioni helping with the interior

  we find no reason why dold should not do
the covers as evidenced by the superlative ma-
terial furnished by his november and december
illustrations for the skylark serial

  as a final measure as to illustrations we de-
mand one full-page illustration for every story
exclusive of novelettes and serials to which
should be given two full-page illustrations this
concludes our opinions as to illustrations and
illustrators

  concerning the stories hr-mselves we believe
that proxlma centauria the mightiest machine
brass tacks

s

and all of stanley g weinha urns works can be
held as ideals in science-fiction these stories
you will note have a good deal of the quality
which characterised the older stories which you
liave been striving to gel away from

  we believe that in this list should he in-
cluded redmask of the jutlands and its sequel
also warriors of eternity and its sequel there
has of late appeared in your magazine certain
stories by that arch-fiend stanton a coblenti
such as triple geared radio mind huy the
truth about the psueho-tector and riches for
pluto these we believe to be the lowest depths
to which science-fiction can lower itself

  the same may be said of calvin peregoy with
that lunatic nit-wit ted abysmally foolish dr
conklin we wish that you would discontinue
the attempts at humor  and instead put a
litlle more action in your narratives at the
same time reviving the hawk carse scries

  as to your brass tacks columns we fail to
see any reason for the name given to it and
would advocate a return to the name the
renders corner

  we have noticed on the whole that your
readers appear to be of a fairly intelligent turn
of mind the only thing that amazes us is
that a person of tuckers apparent mentality is
able to write at all furthermore the fact that
his inane ravings are published in your columns
casts  slight aspersion on the editors own
menial condition

  we wish to state that we would be all too
willing to pa five cents more per copy and have
the edges trimmed if your circulation is even
approximately as great as you say then this con-
venience would not be very expensive to you

  we base noticed that many cheaper publica-
tions in the pulp group have trimmed edges
and it is on tnia point particularly as well as
the aforementioned covers by dold that we wish
the readers who are in agreement with us to
write to you iu a group we invite discussion
and backing through the columns-robert c

wants superscience

dear editor

  you asked for criticism and youre going to
get reams of it constructive and otherwise i
realize the difficulties of writing and editing
sclence-tiction and  am naturally a little hesi-
tant in passing judgment on cither authors or
editors but as every one  have my ideas
preferences and criticisms-so here they are-
iroin rout to back-beginning of course at the
cover

  the cover of the october  issue is one
of the few artistic covers i have seen on a
science-fiction magazine it is quiet enough that
even the most timid should not he scared away
and yet the helmeted figure and the astound-
ing title iu the red block j am not god arc
truly eye-compelling yet not blatant

  the covers have been showing a definite im-
provement for six months please do not use
covers like on the june  issue the covers
ol august  and september si are nearly
perfect for your magazine please keep h v
brown

  as we turn from the cover we see the adver-
tisements you see-my criticism does not pass
up anything  am glud to see you have a fair
class of advertisers

  next-the contents page completely satisfy-
ing in its make-up a suggestion  could you
not include either on this or some other page
or scattered about as formerly a hint as to ihe
feature stories for the coming month-not neces-
sarily a complete list

  next-the interior illustrations dold is the
best is the truth-nuf sed why do not the
other artists put their name on their work

  now the stories in the october  issue
night was a wonderful conception-better than
txcilight it was a depressing story but i liked
it for its atmosphere-well written derelict-
very good hut obviously wanting a sequel a
good character study-of a man and of a ma-
chine islands of the sun-part two much
better than one but far below williamsons
standard interesting intra-planetary--a new
manner of presentation but not a new idea-i
do not like most medical stories or intra-homo
if i may coin words  am not god-a grip-
ping storv- wait eagerly for the conclusion
a princess of pallia-an interesting bit of well-
written light adventure-interplanetary my fa-
vorite field the planet of doubt and way of
the earth-same comment as above faceted
eyes-interesting phantom star-fair

  next the editorial i like this much better
than a scientific treatise o k

  and brass tacks have dold draw a new
picture heading for this department a few
comments on readers suggestions quarterly vs
semi monthly vs new magazine the third is
detinitelv out i much prefer a quarterly but
i fear it would not be a success a semimonthly
would be too much drain on the hank roll
stay as you are for a time and give us the bene-
fits of a more rigid selection of stories

  do not as one reader suggests put a word
limit on letters the long drama by miss popoe
was much preferable to several shorter less well-
written letters and letters from smith and
campbell are the longer the better

  more science vs less science give us super-
scicnce as skylark well-written fantasy as
	astounding stories

greater glories light adventure as a princess of
pallis but go easy on long rambling stories that
are not so astounding short stories of any type
if fairly well-written are acceptable-but be
careful with the longer stories john taines
twelve eighty-seven and islands of the sun
were barely passable because of this fault we
want suspense action or at least compactness

  incidentally the thought-variant stories are
invariably the best galactic circle colossus
eternal living equation and the campbell and
smith stories have truly astounded me for all
ray years of reading scienceffiction sorry i
missed icebirth

  as for science content of stories  the avatar
was too dry-too much textbook science
islands of the sun might have been helped by
more science as well as a more closely woven
story please do not give us material of the
type of doc savage i literally devour really
good superscience-all of e e smiths and
john w campbells stories

  aside from this argument of adventure vs
science is another lield-pure fantasy of
course we do not want ghost stories but if you
have read williamsons and merritts works you
know that fantasy can be built from a super-
scientific foundation

  you object that lovecraft writes only weird
fiction i believe he could equal merritt if he

  the magazine in general the type both for
stories and brass tacks is all right dont
bother yourself over type of paper smooth edges
etc its the contents that count

 and now-may i shift gears tucker
sterling and wollheim have all overlooked the
most obvious method of binding our magazine
 submit patent applied for that you bind
astounding stories with-youve guessed it-
brass tacks what could be more obvious and
reasonable of course chewing gum is o k
plain wire or platinum staples are old fashioned
i might mention that my patented brass tacks

dold takes it now

dear editor

  ive just about finished the october issue and
its swell the cover was one of browns best
pieces of work but some of the interior illustra-
tions didnt burn the magazine because they
werent so hot

  lets start with dold i like his work a great
deal but he sort of falls down on the job in
spots his chief weakness seems to be in human
beings they look so unnatural then he
makes his machinery and things too complex
complex machinery is all right for a science-
fictiou magazine but i think he goes to extremes

  marchionis work is picking up but who let
that illustration for faceted eyes creep in

  is there a possibility of getting edgar rice
burroughs it was his stories that first in-
troduced me to science-fiction if it hadnt been
for him i wouldnt be reading astounding and
i wouldnt have interested three other people in
your linn magazine so you see hes indirectly
responsible for at least four subscribers how
about it

  why not put such book-length serials as the
legion of space the skylark of valeron and
the mightiest machine in book form ill bet
they would sell

  iu closing i would like to comment on the fine

work you have done with astounding i didnt
like the way it started under the new manage-
ment but its the best there is now -robert
boelke new lenox illinois

we agree

dear editor 

  the three best stories in the november issue
were iu my opinion the lied peri blue magic
and fruit of the moon-weed the concluding
serial i am not god also rated high the
cover was good

  you can do as you wish about science edi-
torials but i dont see why we would need them
in this magazine what we want is fiction not
a lot of editorials on facts that can be read iu
the libraries keep your own personal editorials

  ive read other magazines for years and i
have found out that whenever they try to pub-
lish science editorials the stories are crowded
out for lack of space their quality suffers or
the price of the magazine is as a rule raised
therefore thnmhs down on science editorials-

straight to the point

dear editor

  this is my first letter to a magazine but one
has to start some time no doubt  have been
rather interested iu your eifons lo improve your
publication i hope they are us sincere as they
seem to be because your lield is a good one and
many more people would be interested iu it if
better work were done there

  your cover painting by howard brown for
october is the most attractive of such covers
that i have seen for some time the one he did
for the september number was rotten iu the
first place it looked like a steamship poster and
reminded one unpleasantly of a map the color
was hard and disagreeable the subject mailer
had no attraction and the general composition
was crude there really was no composition to
speak of in fact it had no appeal to ones
curiosity or aesthetic sense either

  the cover on the october number was par-
ticularly good lor its colors they were har-
monious and pleasing the greens and warm
blues fitted in well with the more intense yellows
and reds of the letterhead perhaps you editors
dont realize it but the actual artistic attraction
of a cover its pleasing of the eye alone has a
great deal to do with the selling powers of your
magazine naturally you do realize it but not
the way i mean

  a cover has to do more than startle the public
and perhaps you are not entirely aware of it
but the public taste in artistic matters is con-
siderably better than it was ten years ago your
artist probably knows what good illustration is
give him free rein and see how it turns out
let him pick his own story and illustrate it in
the way he thinks most fitting

  this business of trying to give the public ex-
actly what it says it wants is no bed of roses-
because it doesnt exactly know it knows what
it likes when it sees it but it is unable to sav
clearly in a great many caes manv times it
will like utterly unpredieted things

  as a pulp magazine astounding stories is in
the higher class along with some-at least one
-of its rivals my big complaint is that the
plausibility of the stories is ignored too often
whether the idea is reasonable or possible has
nothing to do with the matter it only needs to
be convincing stories like islands of the sun
the blue infinity and v to mercury are ex-
amples

  i thought the style of w to mercury rather
cheap the whole idea and theme was hack-
neyed islands of the sun was too much the
sentimental swash-buckling type also it lucked
plausibility the hero was too good the villain
was too bad the situations too put the plot
brass tacks



too obvious the same criticisms can be di-
rected toward the blue infinity

  the stories  have liked are earth minus-
especially to be recommended-sky hock the
upper level road and sight oh yes the
galaclic circle also was rather good

   i think the october issue of astounding sto-
ries tlie best so far

   i hesitate to tell you my profession because
it probably would lessen the value of my criti-
cism what you want  imagine is the opinion
of flic general average public mine isnt pre-
cisely that

   in any case i wish you would try to get your
writers to put more realism in their stories
you know whit i mean when an author sajrs
the man was mentally deficient you dont
particularly believe him hut when he says
william had never been able to learn to lace
his shoes or use n fork without hurting himself
you know full well that william is mentally de-
ficient without the author futilely telling you so
your stories often have too much of that fault

  hut as  said there are many worse maga-
zines on the market and yours is gettinc better
thanking you for your kind attention-kenneth

provoking although unscientisc

dear editor

    must say that intra-planetary in the october
issue was thought-provoking although unscien-
tific nearly all of us have speculated on the
possibility of germs and other forms of uni-cellu-
lar life possessing intelligence in observing the
actions of typhus bacilipreums cocci ami other
forms of bacteria  find that their action seems
to indicate that they not only possess no in-
telligence but they have no cognizance of ex-
istence however others may have observed

different reactions and if so i would like to
hear from them

   was glad to see a story by an author whom
i consider the best of the younger writers  j
harvey haggard

   astounding stories is getting better and bet-
ter personally i believe that the present edi-
torial policy gives us well-balanced stories with
a few exceptions they are all scientifically sound
have enough adventure and the love interest is
kept in its proper place

  i would be jlad to hear from any one inter-
ested in chemistry and esperanto-robert h

the welsh attack

dear editor

   like every one else i have something to say
about h u welshs gentle compliment lo scien-
titic-fiction in general and astounding stories
in particular i am going to surprise you if
not shock you of course h hs letter was
not up to the usual cranks missive for in-
stance it lacked the beautiful irony of letters
by wollheim and kaletsky however it served
its purpose very well and be will no doubt ac-
quire polish with time

   despite this welshs letter serves a purpose
what purpose you inquire just this that
quotation of his-he says it is a parody hes
wrong its the real thing

   editor dont you remember the story that con-
tained this masterpiece of literature it was
masquerading as a tli-v something about di-
mensional planes and a scientist with false hair
-the villain-remember now dont get me
wrong editor that story was an exception but
it appeared-one of the feature stories too
what im attempting to get over is this why
when you can have such good stories as you
usually print do you allow such junk

   that story was supposed to be a tli-v i like
most th-vs but must you put up with such

terrible writing to get a th-v i know when
you can get such good stories as islands  the
sun-which was certainly a th-v-that you
dont have to print such junk incidentally

alter condemning us fans for judging science-
fietion mr welsh proceeds to judge it himself
as well as the fans and condemns the whole
lot

  all you who love science-fietion and would
see it prosper can you not see that that villain

we do try

dear editor

   although i have read different issues of as-
tounding stories for the past two years i have
not been a steady fan but if you continue to
have issues like the september one you may be
sure i am with you strong my reason for inly-
ing it was c l moore both moore and wan-
drel arc reasons enough for my buying nor
was i disappointed in their stories-greater
glorias and earth minus

    think-no i believe your september issue is
your best so far and it shows you nre striving

from a new reader

dear editor 

   i am a new reader of science-fietion and enjoy
it very much so far i have failed to find any-
thing which eau compete with your magazine
brass tacks is very interesting but would be
much belter if you would comment on the letters

  according to some of your readers they must
think that this magazine is printed for them
only there are other readers to consider and
they should not forget that fact

  now for the illustrators some work better
on one type of story than on another find
out which they do best and let them go at it

   i saw some complaints that science-liction is
not fit to be read to the people who think that
way  why read it also there are some readers
who do not want science in their science-fiction
stories these people should read love stories
or something else

  some complaints about your covers-from
other readers of course why not put the print-
ing at the top and the picture at the bottom in
a box so that it doesnt run together  do not
think that it would be necessary to remove all
the printing from the covers maybe that would
satisfy some of them for a while

  couldnt you give us a better quality paper
even if you do have to charge a nickel more for
the magazine what about it you readers

   if this should get into brass tacks i would
like to bear from other readers of astounding
stories thanks-owen montgomery  east

thinks the skylark is still the best

dear editor

   your serial novels are great stuff of course
islands ol the sun twelve eighty-seven and
other late serials could hardly be classed with
the skylark series yet they arc very interesting
and contain new ideas

   islands of the sun gives one a new conception
of our solar system of course a geologist
wouldnt give it much weight but it is some-


astounding stories

thing to think about something new some-
thing interesting something fairlv plausible all
written in an interesting style makes such a
novel worth reading

  a very tew ol your novelettes have been
great many of liie thought-variant type were
very interesting but they have been too short
the author lakes u short-stoiy idea and puds it
up to novelette size the qatactic circle co-
lou eternal and a few similar ones could
make a person sit up and take notice how
about a hawk carse novelette just for old times
sake	j

  brass tacks is a very interesting section for
those of us who like to read readers letters and
get other peoples viewpoints on various ideas
however it should not be abused by publicity
seekers--say lug anything just to see their names
in print to avoid this i would suggest not
publishing the writers name

had we considered your story plagiar-
ism we would not have bought it

dear editor 

  i give the following four points against the
contention in brass tacks that my story man
of iron was a brazen plagiarism of leinsters
the mole pirate

  	as near as i can recall the whole plot
of the story ideas and nil has been stored away
in my mind for some live years-long before the
advent of the mole pirate this should con-
vince the credulous mind

  	leinster was not the first writer to use
the basic idea in his htorv which i presume
i am supposed to have stolen there were at
least three or four others who treated it though
leinster was the first to wrap a whole story
around it and myself the second eveu the in-
credulous mind should now be satisfied not only
that i didnt plagiarize but that i couldnt

  s leinster did not use the same actional
method of weaving two solids together as i did 
nor did he treat it as i did as a natural out-
grow b of this condition which was the princi-
pal part of man of iron i e the probable ex-
plosion that would result when two solids be-
came aware of each others presence so to bpeak

  	if  fan of iron were to be condemned on
the grounds that it dared to possess a basic
idea in another tale then think of the numerous
naughty authors who have practically taken as
their own whole plots from such once-original
ntories as the time machine war of the world
and journey to the cetiter of the earth  and
think what we would have missed had they not
done so

  i believe i have dispersed whatever doubts
were sown by the accusation made against me

after the first year

dear editor 

  this the november issue rounds out my first
year of astounding stories so i am going to
celebrate the ovation by writing my first and
perhaps my last letter to you

  i want to say that i quite agree with norman
sloan  his comments on the illustration were
very good ou the whole i think that your
magazine ranks with any science-dctiou publica-
tion i have taken two other science-tiction
magazines for nearly three years i shall not
state that yours is so terribly superior to the
other two it is however better in the sense
that it always contains one good serial

  many people dont like serials i do i must
say that your latest serials cannot compare with
the skylark of valeron and the mightiest
machine they seem to contain just the right
amount of science and the right amount of ad-
venture in other words they are well-balanced
why not have some more skylark stories

  just one more thing why not try to get dold
to put more life into his characters he has
wonderful machines but his people seem to be
too stiff and unreal this is not a hard defect
to overcome

  will some one be kind enough to drop me a
letter any one in a foreign country or the

on science editorials

dear editor 

  i am writing this letter iu order to give you
some idea of how i appreciate your editorials
they represent a new trend in seience-fiction in
that instead of their devotion to purely scien-
tific topics they deal with a subject much closer
to the readers heart-namely fan letters

  in the november issue i enjoy the way you
gave your opinion on various subjects it prob-
ably accounts for the high standard found in
your fan letters there was one subtle touch
which i particularly appreciated it was this
the longer ones go out first they take too
much space i believe this a veritable mas-
terpiece of gentle hints to overzealous fans

  mr diffln ought to be excellent in his con-
clusion to blue magic he has built up the sus-
pense well aud if i know my diffin i will not be
let down

  i am sorry to hear that stanley welnbaum is
ill hed better get well in a hurry we all
like to see one of his stories every now and
then

  you seem to think that the kick has gone out
of alphabetical societies if that b so it is

four fault becnuse you probably have been giv-
ng them so much publicity in brass tacks that
the serious reader has grown tired of them
however they would soon grow just as tired
of a completely scientific brass tacks it takes
all kinds of letters to make up brass tacks so
they have their use

  i hope yours wont become another magazine
containing science information which any one
cau find if he or she is interested enough this
is probably the method employed by the editors
who do write science editorials

  one last plea please make editorial com-
ments they would be appreciated-alan aiser-
stein  academy st vvoodmere long island

nothing to complain about

dear editor 

  the november astounding was a good all-
around issue-both stories and illustrations
im glad to see ditfln back ive missed him
weinbaums story was of a different type than
his usual run-more adventurous still i liked
it i imagine you already have a sequel the
ending sounded like it

  anything by john w campbell jr on hand
what about p schyler miller jack williamson
and ediuond hamilton

  i really dont know what to say this month
ive nothing to complain about you didnt give
us titles of stories in advance though

  you might get after chelsea house to put
some of astoundings serials in book form

  i notice you reduced the size of the last word
in the title on the cover i hope its permaneut
i would like to see lifty-page novelettes used
from time to time

  another list of authors id like  harl vincent
murray leinster raymond z gallun harry
bates j george frederick

  best cover was  september 

  its nice to know that astounding has the
largest circulation of any science-tiction maga-
zine but i hope you do not intend to take up
space on the cover every month to say so too
much print spoils the covers-jack darrow

we like readers opinions

dear editor

   i have read your magazine since the first
issue so i think that  am not taking your valu-
able time for nothing when i express a somewhat
belated opinion

   i contend that stuarts twilight is the best
 you have ever printed really the t hi tin is
 classic its epic i cant analyze the story  if
  could id be writing stories like it night was
 good but it couldnt touch its sequel but i
 wasnt at all disappointed because that one
 story completely covered a multitude of sins

   in the course of astoundings career as a
publication you have printed a few really poor
stories-such as lady oj the moon-a few
mediocre and au amazingly high percentage of
good and excellent stories so i have very few
criticisms for you

   your illustrators dont always draw the de-
tails to correspond with the story that really
isnt so important but the little things count
np also your covers are too lurid and while
i am at it are you aware that you have a
set-up for a slick-leaf magazine the editors
page is all right couldnt be better

   oh yes i find that your best stories are those
 which come under the heading of novelettes
 with very few serials in the running heres to
 a million new subscriptions to yonr magazine
 and more power to your pen-l e evans os

another bomb thrown into the fire

dear editor

   i hope you will print this because i have
just read a fact which i think many of the
readers do not know i quote from xeien week
he-dr k h goddard-convinced his col-
leagues that rockets did not need air to push
against in order to propel themselves that the
recoil of the escaping gases actually kicks the
apparatus through space this he demonstrated
in a vacuum tank

   i wish to congratulate you and jack william-
 son on inlands ot the sun it ranks next to
 th skylark  valeron as the best thing you
 have yet printed-henry lemaire pomfrct
 school pomfret connecticut

you really have a treat in store

dear editor

   had you told me that leonardo la vinci had
come back to life and was going to illustrate
for astounding i could not have been more
pleased to me the news that wesso is going
to illustrate for you brings your magazine just
about as near perfect as yon could get it

   and to clinch it with the news tbat you have
 obtained a story by loveeraft the author of
 the color out of spore tbat litte gem pub-
 lished way back in  does not detract from
 this opinion in the slightest like c i moore
 loveeraft is a weird story author and if the
 color out of space was an example of his
 science-fiction i am sure we have a real treat in
 store for us

   also in yonr letter you asked me not to force
 you by demanding more than you can give nil of
 a sudden i never write letters as demands
 one cannot demand anything from a magazine
 from which he is getting twice his moneys
 worth  one can only suggest where there is in
 his opinion room for improvement

   just to add one eomment in tlie november
issue yon stated that you received thirteen let-
ters saying that the rue infinity by fearn was

 roor twenty-seven sayinc that it was excellent
 n this ease i cast my vote with the minority
 why because the storv was too colossal too
 marvelous it broke all of newtons laws of
 motion completely ignored the law of conserva-

tion of energy-which poor van kampen went to
such trouble to try to disprove and had a mil-
lion mistakes in just plain reasoning

   for instance newtons third law says for
every action or force there is au equal and op-
posite reaction here we have several million-
million tons of matter gallivanting through
millions of light years of space and where on
earth does fearn get his equal and opposite
reaction and as h g weils said in review-
ing one of his collected works where every-
thing is possible nothing is interesting--oliver

he liked weinbaum before and now-

dear editor

   from the beginning of science-fiction readers
have complained about the presence of love in-
terest in certain stories it is positive that
after reading the lied ieri those readers will
in unable to complain the ited ieri was mag-
nificent-indescribably magnificent for the
blurb line at the beginning of the story you
said  the best story up to now by stanley g
weinbaum

   the novel lined up to the blurb it far sur- 
passed my greatest expectations and although
weinbaum was admittedly among the best
authors his latest creation undoubtedly proves
him the best 

   in my opinion this classic epic novel was
even better than the leu ion o space better
than the skylark scries as can be seen by the
concluding paragraphs a sequel is needl to
complete the greatest science-fiction novel writ-
ten there must be a sequel perhaps two se-
quels perhaps more mr weinbaum  salute
yon

   your editorial the mail bag was very in-
teresting as indeed are all your editorials
they have a certain dclighlful freshness about
them which makes the friendship between the
editor and reader seem verv strong this cer-
tain friendliness is noticeably lucking in science
editorials in other magazines

   as you received two hundred and eighty-seven
letters during that month i can readily see why
i failed to find my missive in brass tacks

   i am saving the serial hlue manic until i
have all the parts heres hoping tbat it doesnt
exceed two installments three at thp most the
two-part serials have been very popular how-
ever even though it does exceed said number
of installmenls the work of charles willard
piflin is certainly welcome after a long absence
from our pages

   we know dear editor that your superb judg-
ment in tlie pickins of the best ihat your try-
to-please-nll attitude that your upholding and
surpassing the unwritten laws of seience-tiction

dear editor

   i am thirteen years old and am in second-vear
high school i have been reading astounding
stories for the past two years it far surpasses
your other rivals they can reduce their prices
to a nickel and  would still buy astounding

   i have been reading a few of the complaints
of tli- readers in hrass tacks and now i would
like to make a few 

   ii make the magazine a bimonthly

   	ho lint advertise the stories on the cover

    even up the edges of the paper in the
magazine

   	not so many long serials if you must
have serials-have them in two parts

   	if you must have long serials give us
skylark stories

   all of the readers have been raving over john
	astounding stories

taines serials if there over was a worse btory
written x liave never read it

 give us more interplanetary stories earlier
in the year there were about two issues you fell
down on completely all the other issues were
masterpieces give s more sueh writers as nat
scbaehuer and stan weinbaum

  here is an idea which i think lias never been
mentioned before  when you dig up a story
sueh as the skylark of valcron or the might tent
machine put up a special issue containing just
the one story beilin eithotfor thirty-live or
fifty cents	

  the blue- infinity can bclnssed only with
the skylark of valeron sum i class them both
as colossal the only thing f cannot understand
in it is when cheap work was found in the
gravity-tripler generator why wasnt it re-
placed they were still on earth with all tho
resources at hand outside of this alight slip
of thought the story was perfect

  why do you print the letters of these pests
who send in scientific formulas and try to show
off their knowledge what do we care if the
story is scientifically wrong as lone as it is

impressions

dear editor

  impressions of the november issue 

  cover  i dont like the red ship

  tabic of contents what no thought-
variant

  the red peri ought to satisfy those who
want action stories a series is indicated and
should be as good as hawk carse

  fruit of the moon-weed fair-nothing ter-
rific how could he l-iss the girl with that hel-
met on 

  ships that come hack gripping but not
lofting

  when the cycle met drivel where is the
beginning and end of a circle

  the lirhtn from fron long ought to learn
some physics wlint body with the attraction of
one-hundredth of a g could hold ail atmosphere
for any length of time time rate of little
people would be very fast

  the mail ban twenty-seven letters praising
the rlur infinity ten to one that every
one of those was from some one who knew no
science at all i dont sec how they can read
sclence-fiction

  i am not god green nebula-saving the
world which does not want lo be saved-rebirth
-rebuilding-and the only new thing in the
story is the ending well written why docs
dold insist upon drawing clusters of gigantic
separatory funnels-md those titantie beakers

  bob califf praises the blue infinity and
wants less science proves my above point
what do you mean by dissatisfied morons
i have been rending science-fiction since 
and the covers then were as good or better than
they are now youll notice those who are dis-
satisfied are those who have been rending the

mags for a long time and who know what they
were like in the past

  ralph scliroeder a chcmist who knows his
astronomy

  randal obrien  whoopie for the last para-
graph but boo for the one before

  charles shipley  you had better look up the
fltreernld equation disregarding that if the
earth did go back into the past the same people
would he on it thnt wer- there in the future
in fact it would be very difficult to tell thnt the
earth had gone into the past at all anyway
it couldnt go faster than light because of mass
increase

  ramon f alvarez del tey  if the address
wasnt in washington i would think this was
another alter ego of john w cimnbell jr hut
maybe campbell moved and is fooling us

  dale tarr those who think a little about
science knock the blue infinity

  iollon andrews it seems thnt only the old
readers appreciate skylark

  let me repent what i once wrote before and
let the editors please take notice science-fictiou
is science-fiction and if you dont like science
go read something else if i had a printing
press  would like to fill a whole page with that
sentence but  hope that this single one will
suffice i dont know how to make it nny more
emphatic that science-fiction must be written
about scientific fact in the manner that smith
and campbell write their stories

  you may take it from this letter then that i
dont like the blue infinity that i like a lot
of science in my stories and that i just eat up
stories like skylark and the mightient machine

likes and dislikes

dear editor

  the contents of the november issue were on
the whole nearly as brilliant as the fine cover
-one of howard v browns best compositions
however i fully agree with jack harrow-
please eliminate some of the superfluous word-
age ou the cover i seem to get the impression
that the covers are drawn to fit the redundance
of printing thereon

  for some reason i prefer a finely drawn
short short story to an equally fine novelette
comparing stanley weinbaum with sinclair
lewis may be peculiar but weinbaum has that
same ability to build a character to those
who rend and liked hawk carse stories the red
peri should prove an equal attraction

  the red peri reminds me of c l moores
jirel of jory but weinbaum must draw his
stories together the action in the lied peri
was good but it was too disconnected long
periods of conversation led up to n brief llire
of action subsiding again to a slow tempo he
could have told the story in two thirds tho
length with better effect

  thus my compliments to david benumonts
when the cycle met his ending is on par
with real literature and the substance of liia
story blends a tinge of courage with the great
dread--fear of the unknown oh happy future
if mankind breeds men like lotar kavxc

  what a play i am not god would make it
is schnchncrs best without reservation i actu-
ally fought to breathe stnred haggardly at the
screen with steve dodd wc disparage authors
whose endings in stories are commonplace and
just what we expect in everyday life but i
